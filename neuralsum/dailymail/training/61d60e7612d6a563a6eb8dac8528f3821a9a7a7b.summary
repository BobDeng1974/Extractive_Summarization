the independent @entity1 ombudsman is accused of failing countless families who have complained , such as the parents of @entity4 , three , who died due to multiple health service failings patients who complain to the @entity1 watchdog in charge of care are wasting their time , a charity warned today			1
the @entity13 , a lobby group that aims to improve patients ' experience of health care , has declared it has ' no confidence ' in the independent @entity1 ombudsman			1
its role is to investigate complaints over unfair treatment and poor service that individuals have received from the @entity1 in @entity24			1
today , the @entity13 released a report into what it claims were failures by the @entity28 ( @entity28 )			1
it is accused of failing to handle complaints of poor care by families , who they say have been ' let down '			1
the @entity28 , the last resort for those complaining about unfair or poor service from the @entity1 in @entity24 , is undergoing a modernisation scheme			1
last month it revealed it had investigated 2,199 cases in 2013/14 - six times more than the previous year			0
but @entity13 deputy chief executive @entity40 , writing in the report , said it had ' failed to adapt ' to modern demands			1
as a result , it will no longer be referring callers on the charity 's helpline to the watchdog			1
she said : ' for many years we have advised people who contact our national helpline to go to the @entity28 when they have received an unsatisfactory response from their local health service providers			2
' ' sadly we can no longer recommend this course of action to patients , as we have no confidence in the @entity28 to carry out an independent , fair , open , honest and robust investigation			1
' it leaves the victims and families seeking help regarding health concerns cold , alone and frozen out			2
the @entity28 fails them on a regular basis			0
' the report cites the case of @entity4 , who died in 2010 from a treatable condition due to multiple health service failings			0
the three - year - old died 36 hours after his parents first sought medical help for suspected flu and a chest infection			0
in that crucial period , they say they experienced a series of shocking blunders from doctors , @entity80 , an out - of - hours gp service and a hospital			0
the mistakes were compounded when the grieving couple asked the @entity1 to investigate the events leading to @entity4 ’s death from septic shock to prevent future tragedies			2
two initial investigations failed to identify key problems , and @entity91 and @entity92 said they were forced to relive ‘ the life - shattering death ’ of their child to get officials to finally act			0
in march 2012 the couple complained to the @entity97 ( @entity28 ) , the highest authority on @entity1 complaints			1
but they said officials failed to understand information about the case			0
the couple said they persevered in a bid to improve the health service for other patients , including their other sons , now aged nine and two			0
the role of the @entity110 is to investigate complaints over unfair treatment and poor service that patients have received from the @entity1 in @entity24 but they later said they felt ' failed ' by the complaints process after it took four years for the @entity28 to publish its findings			1
the @entity13 said @entity4 ’s death exposed ‘ catastrophic and systemic ’ failings in care and in how the @entity1 handles complaints			1
chief executive @entity124 said : our experience of the @entity28 has been painful			0
' the family wanted organisations to learn so that this would not happen again , but the ombudsman did not want to interview anyone about what went wrong			0
' the @entity28 is the body which is supposed to hold the @entity1 to account and set benchmarks but there seems to be a lack of accountability for its own actions			2
' the @entity13 helpline has advised hundreds of people to contact the ombudsman but time and time again people have come back to us saying the @entity28 has told them there ’s nothing more they can do			1
' at this point in time i would not advise anyone who came to our helpline to contact the @entity28 , because i have no confidence in it			0
a senior executive within the @entity28 told mr @entity4 and i the methodology used in their investigation into our complaints was not fit for purpose			0
' it ’s time that this organisation was subjected to greater scrutiny			0
it costs billions at a time when the @entity1 is struggling			2
if that money was invested in frontline staff we would have a very different @entity1			2
' the @entity13 report recommends an overhaul of the ombudsman to improve investigation timescales , contact with patients and a code of practice			1
a @entity28 spokesman told the @entity175 : ' we have embarked on a radical modernisation drive which includes listening to feedback from users			0
' we are delighted that the @entity13 has agreed to help us draw up a service charter , which will be a set of promises to users about what they can expect when they use our service			2

@entity13 has *condemned* the independent @entity1 ombudsman
has accused it of failing to handle complaints and ' letting down ' families
charity says it will no longer refer people in need to the ombudsman
