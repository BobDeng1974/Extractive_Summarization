by @entity0 published : 11:44 est , 28 september 2012 updated : 12:03 est , 28 september 2012 @entity4 was from @entity5 , politicians on the @entity3 party isle have claimed			1
the bizarre theory , which they admit they can not categorically prove , is based largely on the fact that the fabled 15th century explorer had the same handwriting as @entity12 of the time			1
and now , politicians have vowed to re-brand the island - better known for @entity16 , all - night clubbing and hard - core house music - as the home of @entity21 's discoverer			1
@entity5 calling : the bizarre theory apparently disproves the widespread belief that @entity4 was either @entity23 , @entity24 , or from @entity25 in the north - west of @entity3 that is despite them acknowledging that they can not prove the theory , espoused by self - styled investigative journalist @entity31 , is 100 per cent accurate			1
they also admit they truly can not verify whether @entity4 was born on the island , or even if he lived there for any period of time whatsoever			1
but councillors voted unanimously yesterday to formally advertise the hypothesis that @entity4 was the son of merchants who had a house in @entity42 , the medieval area of @entity43			2
re brand : politicians say @entity4 was from @entity43 and want to re-brand the island on the back of the claim party isle : @entity5 is better known for booze - cruise brits , all - night clubbing and hard - core house music it came with one condition - that it did not cost taxpayers ' on the @entity56 a single @entity57			1
the claim has been met with widespread scepticism , with many taking to @entity60 to say it is simply a publicity stunt to attract tourists to @entity5 's cash - strapped holiday resorts			1
but @entity31 , who claims to have worked as a merchant sailor and pilot , insisted that the seafarer had a ' geocultural origin ' from the island			0
and the self - styled journalist 's alleged 50 years of work had apparently disproved the widespread belief that @entity4 was either @entity23 , @entity24 , or from @entity25 in the north - west of @entity3			1
ibizan hand : a ledger written by @entity4			2
journalist @entity31 claims he had typically @entity76 handwriting of the time @entity5 to @entity21 : an illustration of @entity4 setting foot on @entity21 soil for the first time in 1492 @entity31 's theory was backed by opposition political party @entity82 , whose councillor @entity83 originally proposed the motion			1
he told 20minutos.es that the theory ' was fundamentally sound , based on historic and linguistic studies			2
' he pointed to the way @entity4 has used coastal names from the @entity90 in naming areas in the @entity95 - for example @entity92 , @entity93 and @entity94			1
another indication , he said , was @entity4 ' writing style could be traced back to @entity76 residents			2
@entity83 added : ' even though there could be an error , everything points to this being true			0
it 's just to give someone who did something amazing the correct recognition			0
' he said there were many ways in which the new found origin of @entity4 could be exploited , but that it would not see the council spending much money			2
he said : the council will not spend € 50,000 in books , but if it could spend € 500 on a walking trail through his family home then that could happen			0
' party isle to @entity95 isle : it is claimed that @entity4 was in fact from @entity43 , in @entity5 , off the coast of @entity3			1
born in 1451 , he sailed to the @entity124 in search of the @entity126 in 1492 , but landed in the @entity127 @entity4 heroically led his crew into the unknown as he set sail for the @entity124 on a voyage of discovery in 1492			0
he was in fact trying to find a westward sea passage to the @entity126 when he stumbled across the @entity135			0
born between august and october 1451 , @entity4 was the son of a weaver and small - time merchant			2
as a teenager , @entity4 went to sea , and is believed to have travelled extensively before finally making @entity24 his base			0
it was here that he initially attempted to gain royal patronage for his ' enterprise of the @entity146 '			0
finally he persuaded @entity152 and @entity153 to sponsor the expedition and , on 3 august 1492 , @entity4 and his fleet of three ships , the @entity149 , the @entity150 and the @entity151 , set sail across the @entity156			0
ten days later they came ashore in the @entity127			0
he went on to land on a series of other islands in the @entity95 , including @entity160 and @entity161 , and returned to @entity3 in triumph where he was made ' admiral of the @entity164 ' and viceroy of the @entity146			0
despite his successes , he has been blamed by some historians for bringing syphilis back to @entity169 .			0

local politicians have vowed to re-brand the island as @entity4 ' home
but they acknowledge they can not prove the theory is 100 per cent accurate
it is based on 50 - years of work by a self - styled investigative journalist
*critics* brand it a publicity stunt to attract tourists to @entity5 's cash - strapped holiday resorts
