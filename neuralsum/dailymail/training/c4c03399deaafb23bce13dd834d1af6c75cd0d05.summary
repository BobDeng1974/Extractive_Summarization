by @entity0 published : 08:50 est , 25 august 2013 updated : 11:29 est , 25 august 2013 the @entity1 has halted all demolitions after the wrongful destruction of two houses came to light recently			1
city contractors tore down a dwelling not scheduled for demolition at @entity9 , then the very next day tore down the wrong house on the wrong property on @entity12			1
the city has released a statement admitting the error , and has halted all demolitions until the cause of the two errors can be found and officials can ensure the mistake does not occur for a third time			1
vacant lot : the two dwellings that belonged to a family at @entity9 have now disappeared , leaving behind only empty land ' it was human error , ' @entity1 spokesperson @entity26 told reporters			1
' there were two different types of human error			0
' the first wrongful demolition was only discovered after the owners of the second property at @entity12 alerted authorities			2
on july 11 , a structure that was damaged by fire was razed by @entity39 , a contractor for the @entity1			1
the house was scheduled for demolition - but an undamaged smaller dwelling behind it not part of the demolition order was also torn down			2
razed : this small house containing years of family history and possessions was mistakenly torn down by @entity1 city contractors scheduled : this main home was damaged in a fire and the city had permission to demolish it @entity55 : @entity56 , one of the the @entity9 property owners , was devastated to find city contractors had pulled down a building not on the demolition order according to @entity62 , the work order only detailed the destruction of the first home with pictures and a site map of the one home			1
the second building contained family photographs , keepsakes and other property belonging to the owners of the buildings			2
property owner @entity56 said her family had n't complained to the city about the mistake earlier because they did n't believe there was anything they could do			1
' i did n't call anyone			0
it 's just that i thought there 's nothing you can do , ' @entity56 told the @entity87			0
' it seemed like if they did it , they must 've had authority to do it			0
so what can you do , if they did it , what can you do ? ' puzzled : @entity98 and his wife were perplexed when they drove to their property at @entity102 but could n't find their house @entity56 said many family possessions were lost when the house got knocked down on july 11			1
' my mom 's stuff , her clothes , her shoes , her boots			0
her pictures , my grandma 's pictures , ' @entity56 said			0
this destruction was n't noted by the city until the owner of a second property that was knocked down on july 12 alerted authorities to the error			1
@entity98 was the owner of a large , three - bedroom , ranch - style home in @entity123			0
the house once belonged to his grandmother and @entity98 and his wife intended to renovate the property and eventually move in			1
foundations : a concrete slab is all that remains of the three - bedroom home overlooking @entity102 that belonged to the @entity98 family dilapidated : the rundown house next door to the @entity98 's home that had been scheduled for demolition since january the @entity136 took a drive out to visit their property recently - but they could n't find it			1
' we came around @entity123 looking for the lot and my wife said , " @entity98 , i think the house is gone , " ' @entity98 told @entity144			2
' we looked up there and sure enough , it 's gone ! ' their house overlooking a lake at 9708 @entity12 had disappeared , with only a smooth concrete slab remaining to indicate where the property once stood			2
the house that was actually supposed to be torn down was next door at 9716 @entity12 , and had been scheduled for demolition since january and bore all the signs of dilapidation , with broken windows and untended lawn			2
' i just seen an excavator tearing that house down and i was wondering why , ' neighbor @entity160 told @entity161			2
empty : the @entity1 has said it will compensate the two property owners for the mistake that cost them their homes and possessions marked : the letterbox is all the remains of the home which was wrongfully demolished at 9708 @entity12 ' it was a pretty good house , it was n’t all that bad , when this one next door has been needing tearing down for years			1
' ' there is a common thread , ' @entity26 said			0
' it was the same contractor with the same code supervisor in charge and the same code supervisor on site			0
that said , in both instances there were honest mistakes made			0
and that ’s why we ’re putting policies in place to ensure we have safeguards			0
at @entity9 the contractor took it a step too far , at @entity12 we had a city staffer inappropriately mark the house			1
so in both instances there was a human error			0
' according to @entity161 , the code compliance employee is on paid administrative leave during an investigation into the incidents			0
the contractor did not respond to a request for a @entity202 said the city is working to ' do what is right ' for the property owners			1
@entity98 , who works to build community centers in disadvantaged neighborhoods , has graciously accepted the turn of events			0
' i see so much around here , people that need help and have less that , it ’s an accident , let ’s do what ’s right and move on , ' he told @entity144 4 .			0

a city contractor pulled down two wrong houses in two days
the first was a case of right property , wrong house
the second was the wrong house on the wrong property
@entity1 officials have called a halt on all demolitions until an investigation can be carried out
a spokesperson has said both *homeowners* will be compensated for their loss
