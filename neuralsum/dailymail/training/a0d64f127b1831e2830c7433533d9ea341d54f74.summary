by @entity0 published : 09:50 est , 21 october 2013 updated : 12:16 est , 21 october 2013 a woman who is now working as a male model has released a video of the life - changing moment when she had her hair cut off			1
@entity8 came forward last week talking about her decision to use her androgynous looks in a different way by seeking work as a male model instead of female model			1
now she and her husband have released the video of the emotional moments where she took her place in the barber shop chair and watched as the electric clippers			1
watch the video here the final look : she left her hair longer in the middle to give her some styling options excitement : @entity8 decided that in order to make it in the world of male modeling she would have to get her long hair cut off for good she wrote about the experience in the @entity34 , saying that when she went to @entity36 @entity35 she had to stand tall and stick to her guns			1
' they said , “ we do n’t actually do women ’s short - style haircuts			1
” i laughed and said , “ i understand			0
i want to look like a boy , ” ' she wrote			0
' when i sat down in the chair , i told him , “ i ’m going to cry , but do n’t worry about it			0
i really want to do this			0
” ' sailors , 31 , has explained that the decision to drastically change her look is a pragmatic one , as she feels that she will be able to stay in the industry longer as her career was headed down a catalogue - focused path as opposed to high fashion			1
' for the last year i 've been focusing on the artistry of it and the creativity of it and not the financial of it , ' she told @entity61			0
' it 's not a gimmick that i came up with because i could n't think of something else she and her husband @entity65 married in 2011 and over the course of their first year as a married couple they had multiple conversations about the prospect of changing her look to work in the male modeling world			1
sailors told @entity61 that he has been extremely supportive , and after she did one photoshoot in august 2012 where she had her long hair styled to look like she was a man			2
after that photoshoot , she went to a self - help seminar and she ' got really connected to what it is i am doing in the world			2
' ' i want to make something else available and possible for people , ' she told @entity61			0
big step : she warned the barber that she might cry but she really did want to go through with it where 'd it go : sailors ' husband supports her decision and took her to his barber sailors , who is 31 - years - old , is not the first woman to take this unusual route as @entity99 , 35 , was the first woman to be signed on a modeling contract for only male gigs , and like sailors she has no intention of taking an permanent steps to physically change genders			1
' i cut my hair before she signed with @entity108 ( modeling agency ) but when she signed with @entity108 , ' sailors said of @entity99 , who she has never met			0
while admitting to @entity61 that she ' was a little bummed about not being the first ' she also has ' really gotten aware of the gratitude ' that she feels towards @entity99 and other gender - bending models who have helped pave the way for their particular career path			2
the fact that @entity110 has a first name that is typically used for men - @entity120 - is just a stroke of familial luck as it is her mother 's maiden name			1
her mother has been just one of the voices against the gender roleplay , but @entity120 maintains that she is ' just as loving as she 's always been '			2
once her @entity129 , @entity130 - based mother woke up and watched her segment on @entity132 , @entity110 immediately called her and checked in that everything was alright			1
exposure : sailors made an appearance on the @entity132 monday morning and she hopes it will jumpstart her bookings her husband @entity65 has been a constant source of support , and he was the one holding the video camera during the landmark haircut and he suggested they go to his barber for the big step			1
@entity65 was the one holding the video camera during the landmark haircut and he suggested they go to his barber for the big step			1
' @entity149 welled in my eyes again at the first buzz			0
but i was determined not to have a tear fall , ' she wrote in @entity155			0
' it was n’t so much about my hair — it ’s just hair			0
it was really that i had been a model for so long			2
it ’s what i do			0
it was saying goodbye to what i had been and knowing that i was starting something brand new , and i had no idea how it would go			0
' androgynous : before cutting off her hair , @entity120 ( seen here with her husband @entity138 ) was regularly critiqued for having masculine features standing tall : sailors ' decision has been met with mixed reviews different approach : @entity172 decided that instead of getting criticized for her masculine facial features when she booked women 's fashion work , she is now pegging herself as a male model then and now : @entity120 , whose name is her mother 's maiden name , used to flaunt her long blonde locks ( left ) but now has her head shaved at a barber ( right ) she appeared on @entity132 this morning , and though she has not revealed how many bookings she has confirmed in light of her 2012 haircut , she said that the exposure is a good thing in itself			1
' i ’ve never regretted it			0
i ’m standing for something different to be possible in the world — and not just for me			0
it ’s a stand for self - expression , transformation and freedom , ' she wrote .			2
