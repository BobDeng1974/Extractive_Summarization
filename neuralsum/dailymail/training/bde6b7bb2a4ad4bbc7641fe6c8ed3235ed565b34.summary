it was almost as if @entity3 had borrowed some of the magic of the @entity6 on sunday night at @entity7 as his @entity1 played at being giant - killers and took the scalp of @entity10			1
on one of the greatest nights of his managerial career @entity3 masterminded a 1 - 0 win with the side he took over last november seeing off @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 in style			1
he was given a helping hand by opposing coach @entity21 who bizarrely left @entity16 out of his starting line - up – perhaps the @entity10 coach was also paying homage to the world ’s oldest club cup competition by resting his most important players			1
@entity10 came into the game having picked up just one of a possible 12 points in their last four visits to @entity7			2
they were facing a @entity1 side who had already beaten @entity36 and @entity35 at home			1
@entity21 ’s side now needed a goal but with top scorer in the @entity96 ( 15 goals ) on the bench and @entity18 , @entity10 's second highest league scorer with 1 , alongside him that was always going to be more difficult			1
this was not the way for @entity10 to take advantage of @entity36 having lost to @entity102 in the earlier sunday game giving them the chance to go top			1
@entity17 was looking for his second league goal of the season and might have fancied his chances from a free - kick on 20 minutes but @entity69 took the set - piece and sent it over the bar			1
@entity17 then charged through on goal but played in @entity72 who squandered the chance			2
the former @entity116 striker cut a frustrated figure in an attack between @entity72 and youngster @entity119			0
it was n’t what he signed up for when he made his £ 75million pound switch in the summer			0
@entity17 played in @entity72 again but this time the winger crossed and when the ball hit @entity125 on the arm @entity17 appealed but the referee waved away the calls for a penalty			0
@entity21 controversially left out the likes of @entity16 ( second left ) , @entity74 and @entity68 ( right ) from the @entity10 starting @entity131 @entity16 watches the action from the @entity10 bench after surprisingly being left out by coach @entity21 @entity10 defender @entity82 ( right ) heads into his own goal to give @entity1 the lead @entity1 's @entity50 ( right ) attempts to claim the goal after @entity62 's header on two minutes @entity1 's players celebrate after taking an unexpectedly early lead in @entity141 @entity1 's @entity50 ( centre ) and @entity144 ( right ) leap for joy as a dejected @entity17 tries to appeal @entity1 almost made the most of the stroke of good fortune going down the other end and nearly doubling their lead			1
full - back @entity151 admitted recently that @entity3 has been encouraging him to overlap a-la @entity153 and the defender flew down the left and crossed for @entity50 who just failed to connect under pressure from @entity82			1
it was the perfect chance to make it 2 - 0 but there was another scare for @entity10 moments after			1
@entity144 pulled off a clever turn that left @entity65 on the seat of his shorts and the former @entity36 man shot at @entity64 only for the one - time @entity1 keeper to palm the effort away			2
@entity55 then charged through and was booked for diving , the former @entity168 man had gone down under a challenge from @entity66			0
with two minutes left of the first half and @entity16 already warming up @entity10 had their first shot on target but it came from distance from @entity72 and was comfortably saved by @entity43			1
@entity1 supporters whistled match official @entity176 off the pitch at half time after he booked @entity125 in injury time for handling as he stopped @entity17 going past him			0
the ball did not appear to have touched the defender as he went to ground			0
all @entity10 eyes were on @entity16 ready to make his delayed entrance at the start of the second half			2
he replaced @entity71 on 45 minutes and @entity18 replaced @entity72 on the hour – once the @entity187 had removed his necklace			2
he was perhaps not expecting to come on having had the least rest during the midwinter break			0
despite the changes it was @entity1 who looked like scoring next with @entity50 heading just over after @entity64 had failed to come for a cross			0
@entity16 tried to bundle his way through at the other end as the visitors did their best to get a foothold back in the game			0
he took the next sent piece but came no closer than @entity69 had in the first half			0
@entity68 was thrown on too and with @entity10 switching to three at the back @entity1 needed some heroic defending to see out the second half but with @entity125 superbly marshaling the troops @entity3 men did exactly that			2
@entity17 had the best chance but was brilliantly denied by @entity43			0
after so many headlines about @entity3 ’ future at @entity211 , on monday morning the inquests will all be for his rival @entity21			2
the @entity214 ’s job is in doubt			0
@entity3 has won his first big game in @entity217 and is settling in very nicely indeed			0
12 months ago , @entity3 was reeling after @entity211 were dumped out of the @entity6 at the first hurdle by @entity219			0
a last - minute goal by @entity221 secured a 2 - 1 win at @entity223 after @entity224 equalised a @entity226 opener			1
former @entity116 striker @entity17 ( left ) competes with @entity1 's @entity151 as @entity10 chase the game @entity10 forward @entity72 reacts after missing an opportunity to bring the visitors level @entity10 enforcer @entity66 ( left ) holds off @entity230 during the first half @entity65 ( left ) of @entity10 competes in an aerial duel with @entity230 ( centre ) and @entity49 @entity234 forward @entity17 races away from @entity51 as @entity10 chase the game in the second half @entity3 screams instructions from the sidelines as @entity1 fight to maintain their slender lead @entity16 was introduced in the second half along with @entity18 as @entity10 tried to change the game @entity187 superstar @entity18 ( right ) appeared slightly rusty after coming on as a second half substitute @entity17 reacts to a missed opportunity in his own typical style as @entity10 push forward in the closing stages @entity1 's @entity46 ( centre ) blocks a shot from @entity16 as the home side hang on for their dear lives @entity10 coach @entity21 can expect criticism after his decision to leave out star players backfired			1

@entity10 missed the chance to take top spot in @entity32 after @entity36 's 2 - 1 defeat to @entity102 earlier in the day
@entity21 controversially left out star players such as @entity16 , @entity18 and @entity74
@entity3 ' side had previously beaten @entity36 and @entity35 at the @entity37 this season
@entity10 defender @entity82 headed into his own goal to give the hosts the lead after only two minutes
