by @entity0 published : 07:34 est , 27 january 2014 updated : 11:36 est , 27 january 2014 you might think it tricky to get any more make - up on to @entity6 's face			1
but you 'd be wrong			0
a @entity8 - based make - up artist has now created a likeness of the future mrs @entity11 using only lipstick , blusher and eye liner			1
beautician and mother - of - four @entity17 , 34 , has turned painter , creating realistic artworks of celebrities including @entity6 , @entity21 and @entity22 using only cosmetics			1
@entity17 paints the unmistakable images using a range of luxury , professional make - up products to replicate the longed - for beauty looks worn by @entity29 , @entity21 and @entity22			1
the finished portrait of @entity6 perfectly captures her signature make - up look , as well as being a stunning portrait of the reality star @entity17 has only been doing the ' make - up art ' for three months , but has already been inundated with requests from people who want her to emulate their favourite famous icons			1
she specialises in using everyday products to capture the pristine celebrity look on canvas - using everything from eye liner and blusher to lip gloss and eye shadow			0
@entity17 said : ' i 've been really surprised at the response i get from people on social networks every time i post a picture			0
' i have received some lovely comments from some amazing and very talented people who are well recognised in the make - up world			2
and i am slowly building up followers on @entity57 and @entity58			0
' i have even received a number of requests from fans of my work , asking me to draw them in make - up			2
' @entity17 uses all the tricks of the trade to create her artwork , which she draws onto canvas , replicating the looks often seen on popular celebrities such as @entity22 mother - of - four @entity17 has 16 years of experience working in the beauty industry and now runs her own freelance hair and make - up company , @entity75 and make - up			1
the inspiration for the portraits came after @entity17 watched @entity29 on tv show @entity80 , and thought what an amazing job it would be to do the hair and make - up for the top supermodels			2
the young mother purchased pro-charts - a specialist book of paper that is used to map out make - up ideas for photo shoots - and started to experiment using different kinds of make - up to match the looks made famous by some of the most well - recognised female celebrities			2
@entity17 's work - which includes portraits of singers such as @entity21 , pictured - has seen her gain popularity on social media this portrait of @entity29 is incredibly realistic , despite being painted entirely using everyday make - up items @entity17 posts all of her work on her @entity58 and @entity57 pages , and has painted famous faces such as @entity21 , @entity29 , @entity6 and @entity108			1
and each one of her pictures is made using enough cosmetic products to do the full make - up for around five brides			1
@entity17 added : ' i find the whole process quite therapeutic , it helps me to relax when the children are in bed			0
' but i can be up until the early hours as the hours just seem to fly by			0
' this picture shows the evolution of @entity17 's portrait of @entity6 as she builds up each layer of make up as if on a real person she added : ' it takes about two days in total to create one of the images , as i always like to leave it for a day and come back to it with fresh eyes			0
' then i just pick up where i left off , as and when i have the time ; but with four kids , a boyfriend and a full time business to run this is now becoming my " me time "			0
' i definitely think these charts look better in person as it is quite hard to capture them in photo , as any change in lighting or angle and it changes the look completely			0
' it has also become a bit of a running joke between my friends and family that if anyone asks if i 've ever done a celebrity 's makeup , i can say , " yes , i 've done @entity22 's "			0
' @entity17 uses make - up to create her artwork , like this picture of @entity22 each portrait , such as this one of @entity108 , uses enough cosmetic products to do the make - up for around five brides each picture starts with a basic sketch of a celebrity 's face , in this case @entity22 , which @entity17 then builds on dr @entity163 , left , saw @entity17 's work , and commissioned her to do a portrait of him , right , for his cosmetic surgery company @entity167 @entity17 , pictured left , now runs her own freelance hair and make - up company , @entity75 and make - up			1
