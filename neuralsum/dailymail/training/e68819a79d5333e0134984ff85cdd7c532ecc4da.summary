@entity0 ! goes the machine , quietly			2
@entity2 ! screech the nerve endings in my cheeks as yet another searing rush of ultrasound energy whizzes through them			2
' are we still friends ? ' questions cosmetic nurse @entity11 , as she hands me a mirror to survey how much difference her ' miracle machine ' has made to my face			1
we are still friends , but only because the agonising pain has stopped			2
i ca n't , however , guarantee that will be the case when the machine is switched back on			2
@entity21 isthe latest non-surgical face - lifting device that claims to ' shrink - wrap ' your face from the inside , tightening sagging skin and kick - starting the growth of new collagen i 'm at dr @entity32 's swish @entity31 clinic trying out something called @entity34 - the latest non-surgical face - lifting device that claims to ' shrink - wrap ' your face from the inside , tightening sagging skin and kick - starting the growth of new collagen			1
it 's loved by a host of stars including friends actress @entity40 , and the before - and - after pictures on the company 's website look impressive			1
even the notoriously hard - to - please @entity46 health watchdog , the @entity44 , likes @entity34 , deeming it the only non-invasive procedure to lift the skin on the neck , chin and brow			1
but here 's the hitch : @entity21 is exceptionally painful			1
painful enough to make a bunch of hardened beauty junkies - women who think nothing of having @entity58 without anaesthetic and barely flinch when their skin is flayed with a laser - literally weep			1
just last week , a colleague ( who is no wimp ) left this same clinic in tears , unable to complete the treatment			1
despite its efficacy - and its undoubted money - spinning potential - i know two cosmetic doctors who trialled the machine and decided they would never inflict that level of pain on their patients ( ' everyone said it was horrific , excruciating , ' says one )			1
@entity76 receiving the @entity34 treatment , left , of which actress @entity40 is said to be a fan in the @entity46 , clinics routinely prescribe their patients @entity80 before the treatment or even sedate them			1
so you will understand my apprehension , despite @entity11 's reassurances that most people are ' fine ' with the machine			2
' comfort levels vary from patient to patient , ' says the leaflet about the treatment			1
' there can be some discomfort , but this is a sign that the collagen - building process has been initiated			1
' having not been prescribed @entity80 , i 've made do with taking doses of ibuprofen and paracetamol beforehand			2
the face is divided into sections for the treatment and so i 've asked that we start under my chin , which is most in need of help - just in case that 's all i can take			1
@entity76 after having her chin and right cheek done @entity11 explains that unlike lasers , which zap the surface of the skin , @entity21 uses ultrasound waves to heat something called the @entity115 ( superficial muscular aponeurotic system ) , the muscle - like layer of tissue under the skin			1
' when you add heat to this muscle layer it contracts and tightens , ' says @entity11			2
' it is what plastic surgeons do in theatre when performing a facelift			2
' the heat also leaves a thermal coagulation point , or @entity132 , which will produce new collagen over the next three months			2
collagen production is also stimulated on the lower levels of the skin , meaning there is an instant tightening and lifting effect			1
' with a white make - up pencil , @entity11 marks out the zones on my face and neck that she 's going to treat before firing up the @entity34 machine			1
at first , it feels fine , just a light prickling sensation and so i start to relax a bit			0
but then she starts working on my cheeks			0
all i can say is yeeeow ! i know what you 're thinking - that ultrasound is a gentle , comfortable thing , safe enough to be used to scan pregnant tummies - and so it is			1
' at first , it feels fine , just a light prickling sensation and so i start to relax a bit			0
but then she starts working on my cheeks			0
all i can say is yeeeow ' but when its waves are concentrated in a slightly different way , it becomes a different tool entirely			0
the thing about pain is that everyone 's threshold is different , and indeed varies from day - to - day			1
i know if i 'm tired , or had one too many glasses of wine the night before , even having my legs waxed feels excruciating			0
i 've tried a lot of beauty treatments and , over the years , have graded them into a pain - scale ranging from @entity58 ( which rates at about a two - it 's a series of tiny jabs and really does n't hurt ) to having semi-permanent eyeliner tattooed along my upper eyelash line ( about a nine - intensely painful though also mercifully quick )			1
@entity181 women spend twice as much as @entity183 ladies on anti-ageing creams waxing , i 'd rate at about five			0
to begin with , @entity21 was a manageable three or four , but it quickly rises to an agonising eight , causing me to screw up my face and drum my heels on the couch			1
' try not to fight it , ' says @entity11 soothingly			0
' it makes it worse			0
' ' maybe relax your shoulders , ' adds @entity195 , the publicist , who is watching			0
' at least it 's not as bad as childbirth			0
' ' try deep breathing , ' suggests @entity199 , the photographer			0
so i attempt some of the focused breathing that i 've been learning in yoga , which helps distract me a bit , until the next zzzp of ultrasound cuts me off mid-flow and we all get the giggles and start comparing birthing stories			0
i end up feeling a bit hysterical			0
we take a break and @entity11 hands me a mirror			0
i 'm amazed to find that already my jawline looks more taut , and my whole cheek looks lifted on the side that has been treated			0
so only one cheek 's worth to go ! by now , i 'm feeling fairly gung - ho , as i know we 're nearly finished			1
i try a more meditative approach to pain control , imagining i 'm on a warm , peaceful beach and that the flickering stabs from @entity11 cross-hatching lines on my other cheek are happening somewhere else			0
@entity224 , who tried the @entity34 and said she would do it again ...			0
with @entity80 the whole treatment takes the best part of an hour - it would have been longer , but thanks to prominent veins in my forehead , that area ca n't be treated ( alas , as i was hoping for a quick brow - lift into the bargain )			1
but i 've still absorbed some 400 lines of ultrasound waves			0
i 'm glad i did n't know how many there were before we started			0
and then i go home feeling a bit spaced out from all the endorphins ( the feel - good chemicals that the body produces at times of stress or pain )			1
because the treatment works below the skin 's surface , there is no downtime			2
my skin is a little red , but this goes within an hour , and the treated areas feel stiff inside , as if the muscles have had a fearsome workout			0
i think my jawline looks more defined than it did , but it will be months until the full results show			0
so , yes , i fear this is the most painful treatment you 're likely to find			2
the question then is why would anyone submit themselves to this ? because it works and the pain is fleeting			0
would i do it again ? for sure ! especially if i could get hold of some valium ... @entity21 , from Â£ 750 per area , at dr @entity32 , @entity268			1
