@entity0 has launched a dramatic legal bid to stop her son and daughter from ever returning to @entity4 where they live with her ex-husband - while the children are on holiday with her in @entity9			1
the former @entity10 star has filed for an emergency motion to get custody before she has to put them on a plane on august 19			0
that gives her just a week to convince a judge that her children had been ‘ illegally deported ’ to @entity4 by a @entity19 court which ruled they should live there with ex-husband @entity21			1
bittersweet : @entity0 's two children have been spending their summer vacation with mom in @entity9			1
but they are supposed to return to their father @entity21 on @entity26 emergency motion : the former @entity10 actress has petitioned the secretary of homeland security @entity28 and attorney general @entity30 claiming her children had been illegally deported and that they should stay in the @entity31 with her the move is likely to enrage @entity21 who potentially faces never seeing his seven - year - old son and five - year - old daughter again as he can not travel to the @entity31 due to visa problems			1
having put them on a plane so they could spend time with their mother , if @entity0 is successful in her attempt to keep the children in the @entity31 , he faces unimaginable heartbreak			1
the court documents seen by @entity45 are the latest twist in a bitter battle that has gone on since @entity48 , 45 , and @entity21 , 39 , a @entity49 businessman , divorced in 2010 after four years of marriage			2
it has left @entity48 emotionally exhausted , desperate and having filed for bankruptcy with $ 2 million in debt after spending all her earnings from @entity10 on legal fees and flights to @entity4 to see her children			2
@entity45 can reveal that @entity48 has filed a lawsuit at the @entity59 of the @entity60 in @entity61 on behalf of herself and her children			0
she has sued the @entity31 government , including attorney general @entity30 and @entity28 , secretary of the @entity65 , because she claims that an earlier ruling by a @entity68 judge that her children should live in @entity4 was unlawful			1
only federal courts can deal with matters of deportation			0
she wants the @entity73 in @entity9 court to grant her ‘ temporary emergency authority ’ over her children and an order saying the previous ruling was ‘ unconstitutional ’			1
in strong language , @entity48 said it amounted to an ‘ illegal deportation ’			0
the lawsuit states : ‘ emergency relief is necessary because the children are currently physically located in @entity9 , but they are required to return to @entity4 on august 19 , 2014 … @entity84 scene from a marriage : @entity0 left @entity87 in 2009 ( pictured together ) while she was pregnant with their second child after the @entity49 businessman 's visa was revoked			1
a judge awarded him custody of the children in 2012 tug of love : @entity48 says her ex has not made any attempt to obtain a visa so he can come visit to the @entity31			2
the arrangement for the children to live with their father was ostensibly made because @entity21 allegedly lied to get a visa in the past ‘ ... the children are left with no option but to seek relief from this court because there is no alternative means by which they can obtain a legal remedy allowing them to remain in their own country ’			1
the lawsuit says the case is ‘ highly unusual ’ and raises the possibility of @entity48 breaking the law to ensure that her children stay in the @entity31			2
it states that children ’s ‘ only hope of obtaining relief from this court would be to have their mother retain them in the @entity31 , in violation of @entity19 order … ‘ ... such an option would deny the children a meaningful remedy and expose the mother and the children to unjust punishment ’			1
but @entity136 , @entity48 's attorney , told @entity45 : ' @entity0 has no intention of violating the @entity19 judge 's order			1
' this is about @entity0 's children and their civil rights			1
this legal action is the only way for the children to enforce their rights as @entity31 citizens			2
' no person , especially an @entity31 child , should be forced to leave the @entity31 unless a federal authority makes that decision in a manner consistent with the @entity152			0
' that did not happen with @entity0 's children and we are simply asking a federal authority to make a decision consistent with the children 's fundamental rights as @entity31			1
' @entity48 also demands that steps be taken to see if @entity21 could be given a visa to enter the @entity31 to see his children			2
the only reason the current arrangements were decided as such was because he can not enter the @entity31 , allegedly because he lied to get a visa in the past			0
@entity48 , who played @entity168 's mother in @entity10 , has custody of her children 50 per cent of the time but they live and go to school in @entity4			2
but the real issue is the rancor between the two sides , which has never been resolved			0
according to court documents obtained by @entity178 , trust broke down between the pair so badly that @entity48 hired a private eye to spy on @entity87 ' in relation to certain issues regarding child custody and other matters '			0
soon after the birth of their daughter , who was born after they split , @entity87 put out a statement which said : ' i was never informed by @entity0 about the birth of our daughter , nor was i invited to attend			0
@entity0 films a scene from @entity10 with @entity168			0
@entity0 says she spent all her earnings trying to win back her children ' in fact , i found out about it through @entity201 reports like everyone else			0
although this sickens me , i am of course overjoyed that our baby was born healthy			0
' i would ’ve wanted nothing more than to hold our newborn daughter for a few moments , and i only seek to co-parent both our children responsibly and with love			0
' nobody from @entity87 ’s legal team was available for comment .			0

the actress has filed an emergency petition with the @entity73 asking the attorney general and the secretary of homeland security for a temporary restraining order to keep her children in the @entity31
she claims a @entity19 judge deported her children illegally
two years *ago* , the @entity19 court ruled that @entity0 's ex-husband @entity21 could take the children to live in @entity4 and spend vacations with @entity0 in the @entity31
now that the children are here with her , she is determined not to let them leave
