nowhere outside of @entity0 has a fonder place in the hearts of @entity4 fans than @entity5 and its @entity6			1
it was here , of course , that @entity10 and his players completed arguably the greatest @entity13 triumph of them all , coming back from three goals down at half - time against @entity16 to be crowned @entity18 champions for a fifth time in 2005			1
the legend of that night lives on ; @entity10 ’s inspirational reshuffle at the interval , sending on @entity23 to help turn the game , @entity25 dragging his beleaguered team up off the floor , and @entity29 ’s penalty save from @entity30 in the shootout that crowned an epic comeback			0
‘ it goes to show how big the night was , there ’s still a buzz about it today , ’ said the @entity4 skipper			1
‘ every day i have conversations about it , in and around the city i still get asked about it and get thanked for my individual performance			0
‘ it will be in my memories until the day i go , that ’s because i love @entity4 just as much as the fans			1
the feeling when @entity29 saved the last pen , i still get goosebumps now			0
it was a surreal feeling			0
’ @entity25 is the only current @entity4 player left from that night			2
sadly , he will be absent when they return to the @entity6 on thursday night to face @entity40 , a hamstring problem meaning that he has been left at home on @entity69 to try and get fit for sunday ’s clash with @entity71			1
the occasion is bound to stir the emotions of @entity4 fans , even those who were n’t lucky enough to be there in 2005 , and manager @entity74 was quick to acknowledge the significance of the venue when @entity4 touched down here on wednesday			1
‘ of course it was a great historic night for the club and everyone associated with @entity4 respects that , ’ he said			2
‘ it was a little while ago and there wo n’t be too many of our players that were involved at that time , but it ’s a real iconic stadium for the club and a big part of that history			0
’ @entity4 captain @entity25 is the only current @entity4 player left from that historic night in 2005 however , the 34 - year - old ( left ) will miss thursday 's tie after picking up a hamstring injury against @entity97 @entity74 knows that this will be an altogether different occasion , however			1
for starters , the prize at stake is a somewhat more modest – a place in the last 16 of the @entity38 , @entity4 having won the first leg 1 - 0 at @entity0 last week			1
they arrived in @entity5 without eight senior players including @entity25 , some injured and some rested as @entity74 tries to balance his options in the knowledge that @entity4 will not land back home until 3am on friday morning with little recovery time before they face the champions			1
‘ we will have very little preparation time , ’ he added			0
‘ but look , it ’s the way it ’s been dealt and we ’ll deal with it the best we can			0
the players have had lots of challenges to overcome this season and we are ready to keep doing the best we can			0
but it ’s still a @entity18 competition , and i would rather be in it than not in it			0
’ even without so many regulars , @entity74 should still be able to field a strong enough side and has already confirmed that @entity124 will start in attack			0
the main area of concern is central midfield , with @entity25 , @entity129 and @entity130 all absent through injury , but @entity132 could be moved further forward after impressing in a three - man defence since @entity134			2
@entity4 boss @entity74 will be hoping his side can use that spirit to see them through on thursday @entity137 scored a late penalty to give the @entity139 a slender 1 - 0 first leg advantage over @entity40 last week the 24 - year - old ( right ) will be hoping to be involved in the action when the two sides meet on thursday @entity4 ’s 8 - 0 victory over @entity40 at @entity0 in november 2007 remains the @entity147 club ’s heaviest @entity18 defeat , and the biggest in the @entity13 beyond the qualifying stages , but more recent history suggests that this will be no easy task for @entity74 ’s team who have failed to win any of their last four away games in @entity153			1
@entity40 , who are playing at the @entity6 while their @entity154 is being renovated , beat @entity97 1 - 0 here in the @entity38 group stage in december having already held @entity156 to a goalless draw in @entity13 qualifying last august			1
‘ we respect our opponent , ’ said @entity74			0
‘ we have n’t arrived in @entity147 being arrogant enough to think it will be comfortable			2
we understand it will be a difficult game , but we still have a squad strong enough to hopefully get the job complete			0
’ and we know better than to doubt @entity4 at the @entity6 .			2

@entity4 travel to @entity147 to face @entity40 in thursday 's @entity38 tie
reds go into the match with a slender 1 - 0 first leg round of 32 advantage
@entity4 won the 2005 @entity13 at the @entity174
