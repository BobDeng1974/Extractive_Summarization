@entity2 - based @entity1 research centre threatened with closure after 40 years 700 jobs to go in chancellor @entity6 's constituency , 300 more under threat job losses another blow to @entity11 's ambitions to lead world in pharma research two years after @entity14 announce closure of @entity17 facility by @entity19 reporter published : 11:05 est , 18 march 2013 updated : 11:52 est , 18 march 2013 pharmaceuticals giant @entity21 is to axe 700 jobs in the @entity23 as part of restructuring plans that include the likely closure of its @entity2 based research and development facility , @entity1 , it announced today			1
the part - @entity23 part - @entity29 firm said around 1,600 jobs would be cut worldwide over the next three years as it overhauls r&d operations in three major centres in @entity23 , the @entity33 and @entity29			1
the move will see the end of drug research at the @entity1 facility , for many years a hub of the group 's r&d efforts			1
job cuts : drugs firm @entity42 has announced that up to 1,000 jobs could go in the @entity23 and that its @entity45 facility will most likely close			1
many jobs will be relocated to the nearby @entity48 centre ( pictured )			1
@entity21 said it was committed to ‘ exploring all options to ensure that @entity1 has a successful future			2
’ @entity1 currently employs 2,900 people			2
the drug firm said 1,600 roles would be relocated to either @entity54 or @entity48 , with the majority relocating to @entity54 , but 700 people faced being made redundant			0
it added a further 300 further roles could be relocated outside the @entity23 the decision to stop drug research at @entity1 , the company 's largest r&d site , is a major blow to a region that has relied on a centre where @entity42 and its predecessor @entity65 have been discovering medicines for more than 40 years			1
it is also another setback for the government ’s ambitions to make @entity23 a world leader in pharmaceutical research , following an earlier decision by @entity14 to shut its r&d site in @entity76 , @entity77 two years ago and previous cuts by @entity42 's former management			1
@entity1 lies within the parliamentary constituency of chancellor @entity6			1
unions accused @entity42 of creating a ‘ skills crisis ’ in the @entity87 by draining the region of highly skilled research and development jobs in the middle of an economic downturn			2
the @entity88 said it was " devastating " news for the workers , adding that the announcement meant there would be a net job loss of 1,000 in the @entity23 by 2016			0
@entity88 national officer @entity94 said : ‘ this is disastrous news for the @entity23 , and for the @entity87 in particular			0
the vast majority of the jobs to go are research and development jobs at the @entity1 site in @entity2			1
there has been salami - slicing of jobs at this site but this is by far and away the largest slice of job losses at the site to date			1
‘ these are cutting - edge r&d jobs that are both well - paid and essential for a thriving @entity23 economy			2
highly - skilled and qualified workers will be put on the scrapheap			0
’ unite national officer @entity111 said : ‘ @entity42 's decision to relocate over 1,000 jobs to @entity54 is a massive blow for the @entity87			1
the company is creating a skills crisis for the local economy			0
‘ after 40 years of success and hundreds of millions of pounds of investment , we are at a loss as to why @entity42 is now pulling out of @entity1			1
the region desperately needs this highly - skilled workforce - they make a huge contribution to the economy and to the community			0
‘ @entity127 will be shell - shocked by this announcement			0
skilled scientific jobs are in short supply and there are many families based around @entity1 with deep roots in the community			1
it is going to be a real struggle to relocate families hundreds of miles away to @entity54			0
’ the company said the investment reinforced its long - term commitment to the @entity23 and underscored this country 's global importance as a location for biopharmaceutical research and development			1
@entity21 ’s chief executive @entity147 , who will present his detailed strategy plans for the group to investors on march 21 , said the programme would lead to $ 1.4billion ( £ 926.6 million ) in one - time restructuring charges			2
annualised benefits of the overhaul are expected to reach approximately $ 190million by 2016			0
the plan includes a £ 330million investment in a new , purpose - built facility in @entity54 , where @entity42 aims to tap into an environment of world - class academic and clinical life sciences research			1
' this is a major investment in the future of this company that will enable us to accelerate innovation by improving collaboration , reducing complexity and speeding up decision - making , ' mr @entity147 said			0
science minister @entity170 said : ‘ @entity42 's decision to invest £ 330million in a world leading r&d facility in @entity54 is a real vote of confidence in the @entity23 life sciences sector			1
‘ they chose to make this major investment in the @entity23 after considering options around the world			0
our strategy for life sciences provides a very competitive environment in the @entity23 to conduct highly skilled research keeping us ahead in the global race			0
‘ clearly the decision to reduce r&d activity at @entity1 is disappointing			2
but the government will work closely with @entity42 and local partners to ensure this excellent facility has a prosperous future with new opportunities for the site			0
‘ i have agreed with @entity42 and local leaders that a taskforce will be established to co-ordinate work to support @entity1 staff and the local economy during the transition			2
this will work to ensure a sustainable , thriving future for the site			0
’ mr @entity147 , a former @entity205 executive who took over last october , has his work cut out to turn around @entity42 , which faces loss of patent protection on key drugs , which analysts expect will lead to an expected fall in sales of nearly $ 6billion over the next five years			2
as a pure pharmaceuticals group , without the cushion of alternative revenue streams , @entity42 is particularly exposed to patent losses on key prescription drugs , limiting its room for manoeuvre			0
but mr @entity147 hopes to reinvigorate the company by expanding on existing growth business , including the new heart drug @entity223 , and using acquisitions to buy in promising new medicines .			0
