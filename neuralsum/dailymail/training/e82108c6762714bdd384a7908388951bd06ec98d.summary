a @entity9 charity is said to have been given £ 450,000 for health and education projects following @entity1 ’s telethon appeals for cash			1
but it was alleged yesterday that £ 50,000 of the sum handed to the @entity16 @entity5 went to consultants who arranged the charity ’s bid for a donation – a large amount for this type of work			1

‘ @entity105 has sought a meeting with the trustees of the charity to discuss what evidence exists concerning the use of the funds in question , together with the charity ’s governance and financial management arrangements			0
‘ before that meeting the @entity35 has not formed a view of what the outcome will be in terms of any regulatory advice or action ’			0
