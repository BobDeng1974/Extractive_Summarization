by @entity0 no one likes warm beer , or having to wait around for it to be chilled			0
but a new gadget now claims to be able to transform your warm drink into a refreshing beverage within seconds			2
the @entity10 device claims to cool drink cans and bottles from room temperature to 4 ° c in under 45 seconds			1
the investment is based on the product ’s potential to significantly reduce energy requirements in supermarket cooler aisles			2
the inventors hope the device will allow shoppers to choose a drink from a supermarket shelf , place it into the @entity10 machine and get it back chilled without waiting around			1
the gadget uses patented v - tex technology that rotates the drink at a certain speed			1
this , according to the company , mixes carbonated drinks but avoids fizzing when the drink is opened the inventors hope it will allow shoppers to choose a drink from a supermarket shelf , place it into the @entity10 and get it back chilled within seconds across @entity49 , combined commercial refrigerator and freezers are estimated to consume @entity50 of electricity per annum , equivalent to the energy required to power over 20 million households			1
@entity10 claims to provide energy savings of over 80 per cent compared with some standard open front drinks chillers and a 54 per cent saving compared with glass door coolers			2
previous efforts have been made to achieve rapid drinks cooling on demand			0
the problem has always been the time it takes to effectively cool the liquid			0
if the cooling is very fast then the outer layers of liquid freeze before the inner liquid is cooled creating ‘ slushing			0
’ the gadget uses patented @entity72 technology by rotating the drink at a certain speed to create a something known as the ‘ @entity76 ’			1
this , according to the company , mixes carbonated drinks but avoids fizzing when the drink is opened			1
although designed to work as a stand - alone unit , the cooling chamber can also be integrated into existing self - serve chillers			0
the group estimates that the average saving on electricity costs could be equal to £ 700 for each replaced fridge per year .			0

gadget rapidly cool drink cans and bottles from room temperature to 4 ° c
company has received £ 760,000 in @entity21 funding to develop the technology
inventors hope the device will replace supermarket chiller aisles for drinks
