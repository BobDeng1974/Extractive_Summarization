@entity1 agents will take a bullet for the @entity3 , but apparently they wo n't swim for him			0
when the public commissions with jurisdiction over the @entity7 heard proposals for beefing up the presidential mansion 's perimiter , they were told that the government would n't be digging a moat around the building			1
that idea , it turns out , was actually under consideration			0
but @entity18 - @entity17 in @entity19 reported that ' there was concern expressed about having to retrieve people from it			0
' ultimately saner heads prevailed : the @entity25 and the @entity1 are recommending the addition of half - inch - thick spikes , angled away from the @entity7 , to the existing fence			1
the @entity7 might also get a prison - style double fence with space in between , but barbed wire has been ruled out			0
a sitting @entity49 congressman suggested in november that the @entity1 would be better able to protect the president and his family if @entity33 took a more mediaeval approach to security with a moat			1
@entity57 @entity56 rep. @entity55 made the idea part of his brainstorm in a q - and - a session with then - acting secret service director @entity61 during a @entity63 hearing			1
' would a moat – water , six feet around – be kind of attractive and effective ? ' a straight - faced @entity55 asked			2
low - tech fence : a man named @entity68 scaled the existing wrought - iron barrier in front of the @entity7 in september – and ran all the way into the @entity7 while carrying a knife in his pants pocket @entity61 replied that changes to the presidential mansion 's perimeter fence was the main upgrade under consideration			1
' like a higher fence ? ' @entity55 followed up			0
' you 're right sir , a higher fence would certainly help us , ' the @entity1 director told him			2
in the hearing , conservative @entity85 rep. @entity85 of @entity86 suggested that if the @entity7 wo n't build a fence or a wall on @entity49 's southern border , strengthening the @entity7 's fence should be an equally bad idea			2
@entity94 administration officials have long argued that fencing along the @entity49 - @entity97 border would be worthless			0
' i would think that if the admin 's gon na being consistent , ' @entity85 said , ' it 's now time to remove the fence from around the @entity7 , ' cause if it is n't good enough for our border , it should n't good enough for our @entity7			0
' @entity1 acting director @entity61 played mop - up in november , apologizing to @entity105 for hooker scandals , security breaches and a shooting make it tall : @entity86 @entity85 rep. @entity85 said last year that if the @entity94 administration does n't want a border fence between @entity86 and @entity97 , it should n't expect one around the @entity7 or else , the right - wing firebrand added , @entity94 's policymakers should admit that ' maybe there really is some real virtue in having a fence that slows people down			1
' among the @entity1 's recent embarrassing episodes has been a series of fence - jumping security breaches , including a man with a pocket knife who made it all the way into the @entity126			1
@entity55 , the moat - proposing @entity57 , found mention of that hair - raising moment amusing in november			2
' this guy got further in the @entity7 than some of my @entity133 colleagues have ever gotten , ' he said , laughing .			0

@entity7 planners say they 're ready to recommend spikes at the top of the mansion 's *fenceposts* to better protect the president
move comes after several fence - jumpers , including one who *sprinted* inside the @entity7
@entity57 @entity56 rep. @entity55 asked the acting @entity1 director in november if @entity33 needed a six - foot moat
that idea was actually under consideration , but later *scrapped* over *maintenance* concerns and ' having to retrieve people from it '
