by @entity0 in a significant step towards reducing emissions , @entity2 scientists have created the world ’s first renewable jet fuel using only sunlight , water and carbon dioxide			1
if proved on a larger scale , the process could provide the holy grail of renewable energy by creating an on - demand supply of fuel for planes , cars and other vehicles			1
the achievement was announced by researchers in the @entity22 project who have spent the past four years creating a solar reactor that uses focused sunlight to heat up metal oxide			1
if proved on a larger scale , the process may provide a sustainable and scalable supply of fuel for planes , cars and other vehicles			1
pictured is the solar reactor used in the process water and carbon monoxide are then passed into the reactor at 700 ° c , where they split up and form a synthetic gas composed of hydrogen and carbon monoxide			1
‘ the basic idea is to reverse the combustion process , ’ explained @entity46 , who is responsible for the project at the @entity48 in @entity49			0
‘ what we do is take carbon dioxide and water vapour , and introduce energy to produce fuel			0
’ the gas is then compressed and sent to @entity59 , where it is transformed into a hydrocarbon fuel similar to kerosene during a process known as @entity64			1
the achievement was made by a four - year project , known as @entity22 , which has designed a solar reactor that uses focused sunlight to heat up a metal oxide			1
on the right is the solar reactor at work , while the left image shows a computer model of the design in the first step , concentrated light - simulating sunlight - was used to convert carbon dioxide and water to synthetic gas known as syngas			1
this was done in a high - temperature solar reactor containing metal - oxide based materials			0
the syngas - a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide - was then converted into kerosene by @entity59 using the established @entity64			1
although producing syngas through concentrated solar radiation is still at an early stage of development , the processing of syngas to kerosene is already being deployed by companies , including @entity59 , on a global scale			0
combining the two approaches has the potential to provide secure , sustainable and scalable supplies of aviation fuel as well as diesel and gasoline , or even plastics			2
‘ this large - scale method is already in widespread use throughout the world and has been certified for aviation purposes , ’ said @entity46			0
‘ this means the fuel produced using this technique will not need to undergo any new , extensive testing and certification procedures			0
’ the project is still at the experimental stage , with only a glassful of jet fuel produced in laboratory conditions , using simulated sunlight			0
but scientists believe this process could provide a cheaper and more sustainable supply of renewable energy for transport applications			2
' this technology means we might one day produce cleaner and plentiful fuel for planes , cars and other forms of transport , ' said @entity2 commissioner @entity134			0
‘ this could greatly increase energy security and turn one of the main greenhouse gases responsible for global warming into a useful resource			0
’ finding new , sustainable sources of energy is a priority under @entity144 - the seven - year @entity147 research and innovation programme launched at the start of this year			0
@entity22 project partners include the @entity150 ( @entity48 ) , @entity151 , @entity152 and @entity59			2
