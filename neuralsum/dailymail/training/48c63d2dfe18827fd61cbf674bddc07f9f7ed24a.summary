the @entity1 divorce fraud fooled judges at 137 county courts in @entity4 and @entity5 for 18 months before it was spotted @entity7 judges were conned into rubber - stamping 180 fake divorces masterminded by @entity1 fraudsters on an ‘ industrial - scale ’			1
the scam is likely to have netted more than £ 500,000 for the organisers , who offered quick , cheap divorces to unhappy @entity1			1
couples have to wait a minimum of three years to divorce in @entity1 but that can be reduced to months if they lie about their circumstances in an @entity4 court			1
the @entity1 divorce fraud fooled judges at 137 county courts in @entity4 and @entity5 for 18 months before a sharp - eyed office worker spotted a flaw in papers presented to a court in @entity26			1
she questioned why two @entity1 who had the same address in @entity29 were applying for their divorces more than 200 miles away in @entity31			2
investigations revealed that 179 @entity1 who divorced in @entity7 courts had all claimed to be living at an address that turned out to be a mailbox in @entity37 , @entity29			1
the last divorce was given to a spouse whose address was a mailbox in @entity42 , @entity43			2
couples were charged £ 3,000 to £ 4,000			1
the divorces were finalised between august 2010 and february 2012			0
but all were quashed yesterday by the leading family law judge , sir @entity47 , @entity48 , who said it was ‘ a conspiracy to pervert the course of justice on an almost industrial scale ’			0
in the scam , husbands and wives signed @entity4 legal forms that were filled in by the plotters with false details			0
the forms claimed they lived at the bogus addresses , and that they had been separated by mutual agreement for more than two years in accordance with @entity4 law			2
however , in many cases the @entity1 had actually been separated for much shorter periods			0
the divorces were valid in @entity1			0
last night family lawyers said the fraud was made possible by the ease of divorce under @entity4 law , and questioned whether similar cons were being organised for couples from other countries			1
the conspiracy worked because the divorce papers were spread around many courts , none of which cross-checked the addresses			2
anyone in @entity4 and @entity5 can apply to divorce at a county court anywhere in the country			1
the leading family law judge , sir @entity47 , @entity48 , pictured , said the scam was ‘ a conspiracy to pervert the course of justice on an almost industrial scale ’ sir @entity47 said there was no reason to believe the @entity1 had ever lived in @entity7 , and the @entity37 address ‘ was in fact mailbox 201 , one of a number of small boxes located in commercial premises ’			1
he added : ‘ given the dimensions of the mailbox it is clear that not even a single individual , however small , could possibly reside in it			0
the moving spirit of the operation was someone calling herself dr @entity107			0
i have no idea whether that is her real name			0
’ the couples paid someone called @entity111 , who may actually be dr @entity107 , he said			0
the boxes were rented by @entity114 , of @entity115 , north - west @entity1			0
police said he charged £ 120 an hour to ‘ facilitate divorces across @entity118 ’			0
@entity119 , of @entity120 , said : ‘ the manner of divorce in @entity4 and @entity5 is quicker and cheaper than almost anywhere else in the world with , perhaps , the exception of the @entity127 or @entity128			1
in @entity1 , it can take more than three years and , it would appear , that might be too long for a considerable number of people			2
