@entity0 are bracing for a ' wave ' election on tuesday that could put them in control of both houses of @entity5 for the last two years of @entity7 's presidency			1
they already run the @entity8 , and expect to enlarge their majority			0
but the battle royale is in the @entity11 , where the @entity0 's 45 seats could become as many as 54 by the time the dust settles			1
' democrats are expecting an old - school shellacking , ' a campaign consultant who worked for @entity7 's 2012 campaign in @entity16 told @entity19 on monday			1
he was promised anonymity so he could speak freely			0
' president @entity7 has been the worst thing that could have happened to @entity17 in the @entity11 this year			1
everything @entity7 touches this year turns to s * * t. the @entity0 are going to laugh all the way back to @entity25 , and the president is going to be on defense until he leaves			1
' @entity29 press secretary @entity28 , though , insisted on monday the president believes @entity17 will retain control of the @entity11			1
and vice president @entity32 said @entity33 that he does n't ' agree with the oddsmakers			0
i predict we 're gon na ... keep the @entity11			2
he showed up in @entity53 on saturday to help congressman @entity54 – who is already leading by an insurmountable margin			0
@entity16 is one of the most hotly contested races , with both @entity58 and @entity46 showing up in person in recent weeks			0
nationally , the electoral map favors republicans this year because @entity17 are defending just 15 of the 21 seats up for grabs			1
in 2016 the tables will be turned , however , leaving the @entity0 with a two - year window to bring sweeping changes to @entity25 – with a recalcitrant president standing in their way			1
a cavalcade of @entity0 senators and @entity11 hopefuls have promised voters everything from new trade authorizations to a complete repeal of the @entity78 medical insurance law if they find themselves in charge wednesday morning			1
@entity7 would veto a mass - scale rewrite of the @entity78 , but @entity82 sen. @entity81 and other hard - line conservatives have suggested firing off an endless series of bills attacking individual portions of the law – putting the president in a position to either compromise or accept the label of obstructionist			1
' i am absolutely convinced that you ’re going to see with a @entity0 led @entity11 – if we are lucky enough to get that – you ’re going to see bills get to the president ’s desk , ' 2012 @entity0 presidential candidate @entity94 said sunday on the @entity100			1
' he will sign some			0
some he wo n’t sign , no question about that			0
he ’ll veto some , but i think at that point we ’ll find out who really is " the party of no "			0
' @entity106 ? @entity7 will be powerless to dictate the terms of legislation or stop @entity11 votes from happening if @entity0 perform tuesday as expected just weeks ago the @entity11 election outcome seemed anyone 's guess			1
but the final opinion polls have put enough contests in the likely ' win ' column for the @entity0 that even analysts atthe @entity118 , which typically supports @entity17 , has acknowledged that the @entity0 has a 94 per cent chance of winning @entity11 control			1
in @entity49 , former @entity48 sen. @entity48 has turned a deficit into a 1 - point lead , according to an @entity124 poll released late sunday night			0
the once - tight @entity16 race has turning into a runaway , with former pig farmer @entity41 going ahead of @entity17 congressman @entity42 by 7 points in a @entity129 poll			2
@entity41 , who grew up on a hog farm , put herself on the map during the primary season with an ad recalling her chore castrating pigs – as a signal that she would ' cut pork ' in @entity25			0
incumbent @entity17 sen. @entity141 looks to be in serious trouble in @entity143 , despite leading @entity144 rep. @entity144 by eight points in sunday 's @entity148 / @entity147 poll			1
a quirk in the @entity143 's election law provides for a runoff if no candidate wins 50 per cent of the vote and avoid a december 6 runoff			1
in the same poll , voters said they would prefer @entity144 by a 50 - 45 margin in a head - to - head do - over			0
@entity159 is the other state with a runoff clause in its election law			0
that race , pitting @entity17 former nonprofit leader @entity163 against @entity0 businessman @entity164 , might not be decided until january 6 – three days after the new @entity5 is sworn in			1
that scenario , comical for its timing , looks to become a reality			0
@entity168 , @entity169 @entity170 @entity171 ( @entity172 ) @entity173 ( r ) @entity169 @entity174 ( @entity172 ) @entity168 ( r ) @entity175 , @entity176 @entity176 @entity177 ( @entity172 ) @entity175 ( r ) @entity159 @entity163 ( @entity172 ) @entity164 ( r ) @entity41 , @entity16 @entity16 @entity42 ( @entity172 ) @entity41 ( r ) @entity144 , @entity143 @entity178 @entity179 ( @entity180 ) @entity181 ( r ) @entity182 @entity183 ( @entity172 ) @entity184 ( r ) @entity48 , @entity185			0
@entity143 @entity141 ( @entity172 ) @entity144 ( r ) @entity49 @entity44 ( @entity186 ) @entity48 ( r ) @entity187 , @entity188 @entity188 @entity189 ( @entity172 ) @entity187 ( r ) @entity164 has led in each of the last five polls , but by only 2 or 3 points – not enough to push him over the 50 per cent mark			0
the spoiler is @entity194 , a @entity195 candidate who is pulling enough votes from @entity164 to keep him from winning the seat outright on tuesday			0
the other wild card is in @entity178 , where a court battle allowed independent pol @entity179 to replace the only @entity200 on the ballot			2
if he beats incumbent @entity0 sen. @entity181 , he could choose to caucus with either party			2
that race is a statistical dead heat according to a new @entity100 poll , with @entity181 ahead by only a single percentage point			0
if @entity0 have only 50 @entity11 seats at the end of the night , he could play the role of kingmaker – with @entity0 and @entity17 wooing him with promises of committee chairmanships and pork - barrel projects for his home state			1
should the final numbers read 50 - 50 , @entity32 would exercise his official role an president of the @entity11 and cast tiebreaking votes – leaving things in the hands of @entity17 majority leader sen. @entity224			1
other races are tightening as @entity226 draws near			0
in @entity176 , @entity168 rep. @entity168 's lead over @entity17 sen. @entity177 has shrunk from 6 points to just 2 in the past two weeks , according to the latest @entity230 poll			2
the @entity0 expects to snatch @entity17 seats easily in @entity232 , @entity233 and @entity234 , anomalous ' red ' states that elected @entity17 six years ago when president @entity7 's massive support at the polls benefited his party in other races			1
@entity17 will handily hold on to their seats in @entity241 , @entity53 , @entity242 , @entity243 , @entity244 and @entity245			2
staying in the @entity0 column without a struggle will be @entity248 , @entity249 , @entity250 and @entity251			2
losing it : @entity17 majority leader @entity224 of @entity254 could find himself out of a leadership job if republicans perform as expected @entity170 is a toss - up , with incumbent sen. @entity171 struggling to mobilize the state 's native tribes that have traditionally sided with @entity17 in the way @entity261 have in the ' lower 48 ' states			2
@entity188 is in the same boat , as sen. @entity189 tries to hold on against @entity0 @entity187 , a member of the state legislature			2
@entity182 looks to remain with sen. @entity184 , likely the next @entity265 , who is handily leading the state 's secretary of state , @entity183 by trading on both his voting record and his seniority			0
' it gives our state an enormous advantage , he said in a weekend stump speech , ' to have the agenda setter for the entire country looking out for @entity182 on a daily basis			0
' @entity183 also shot herself in the foot in october by refusing to say if she had voted for the politically nuclear @entity7 .			2

@entity0 could gain as many as @entity11 seats but needs just six to take over both houses of @entity5
former @entity7 campaign consultant : ' president @entity7 has been the worst thing that could have happened to @entity17 in the @entity11 this year . everything @entity7 touches this year turns to s * * t '
wild cards *include* an ' independent ' candidate who could join up with either party , and two races that may go to runoffs in december and january
the @entity29 will be on *permanent* defense until the end of @entity7 's term if @entity17 lose big
then the real battle begins as @entity5 will send bill after bill to the president and force him to sign them or be labeled an obstructionist
