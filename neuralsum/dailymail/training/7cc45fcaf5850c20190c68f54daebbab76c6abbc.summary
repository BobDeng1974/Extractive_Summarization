by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 03:39 est , 30 april 2013 updated : 05:47 est , 30 april 2013 @entity2 today finally admitted @entity3 would borrow billions more to fund its policies , less than 24 hours after dodging the question 10 times			1
the @entity3 leader was forced to concede his radio pitch for votes in this week 's local elections had gone ' not so well ' yesterday after repeatedly trying to avoid saying his tax and spending plans would add to the nation 's debts			1
confronted today by claims his economic policies had descended into a ' @entity17 ' , he caved in and said : ' i am clear about this , a temporary cut in @entity20 , as we are proposing , would lead to a temporary rise in borrowing			1
' see video below labour leader @entity2 told @entity26 's @entity25 that his spending plans would mean an increase in borrowing , less than 24 hours after dodging the question in a radio interview mr @entity2 pitched @entity3 into disarray on the economy and welfare yesterday when he was unable to answer basic questions about his party ’s policies			1
he appeared to lose his temper with @entity39 , presenter of @entity40 's @entity41 , telling her ‘ you do n’t understand ’ when she pressed him on @entity3 ’s position on the economy			1
the @entity3 leader refused on ten occasions to admit that his party would increase government borrowing , despite outlining plans that would require more than £ 28billion of borrowing			1
mr @entity2 was challenged repeatedly on how his promises to spend billions more on tax cuts and job creation schemes			2
but during tetchy exchanges on @entity40 he refused to admit he would have to borrow more money to fill the budget black hole in his plans , including a £ 28billion bill for his @entity58			1
today he was confronted on @entity26 's @entity25 by the headline in the @entity60 which branded the interview a ' @entity17 '			1
' that happens , you do interviews - some interviews well , some interviews not so well , ' mr @entity2 said			0
daybreak presenter @entity67 brandished the @entity60 headline which branded his radio interview yesterday a ' @entity17 ' mr @entity2 admitted his @entity40 interview yesterday had gone ' not so well ' he quickly ditched yesterday 's reluctance to come clean about the £ 13billion cost of his plan to cut vat			1
he said : ' i was asked a question about @entity20 and @entity3 's plans to cut vat			1
' i am clear about this , a temporary cut in @entity20 , as we are proposing , would lead to a temporary rise in borrowing			1
' and he went on to repeat his claim that more borrowing would lead to less borrowing			2
' " the point i was making yesterday was that if you can get growth going by cutting @entity20 , then over time you will see actually borrowing fall - that was the point i was making yesterday			2
' borrowing has remained stubbornly high for chancellor @entity89			0
it fell only slightly last year to £ 120.6billion , just £ 300million lower than in 2011 - 12			0
any attempt to add to borrowing would spook the markets , the @entity91 have warned			0
@entity95 , economic secretary to the treasury , said : ' less than 24 hours after refusing ten times to admit the truth , a weak @entity2 has finally been forced to come clean that he plans to increase borrowing			1
' more spending , more borrowing and more debt is exactly what got us into this mess in the first place			1
it 's the same old @entity3			2
' in another difficult interview , mr @entity2 was also pressed about why he is less popular with voters than @entity110 or @entity111 when they were on the verge of taking power , repeatedly refused to predict how many seats he would win in thursday 's local elections and insisted standing on a wooden pallet in high streets was proof he was ' doing politics in a different way '			1
mr @entity2 , pictured campaigning in @entity122 , says that using a wooden pallet as a soapbox proves he is doing politics ' in a different way ' @entity3 is under pressure to make gains of at least 350 in the county and unitary council elections on thursday , to prove mr @entity2 's @entity132 slogan is resonating in all parts of the country			1
' what i am going to do is go out there and make my case to people i am trying to do politics in a different way			0
i have gone from @entity142 to @entity143 - under - @entity144 , going around and doing old fashioned politics if you like			0
' going out into a market square , standing on a soapbox , saying how i want to change the country and taking questions from all - comers			0
' sometimes hostile questions but actually i find that if you engage with people , people do respect you for saying i will take your question whoever you are , whether you are a supporter or not			0
' asked about his approval ratings two years before a general election in comparison to those enjoyed by mr @entity111 and mr @entity110 , mr @entity2 said : ' i am not going to get into these comparisons			0
i am going to go out and do it my own way			0
we are coming off the back of a difficult @entity160 defeat in 2010			0
' what have i done ? i have talked about the things @entity3 got wrong - i have been open and honest about that			2
i have set out a vision for our country , what i call @entity132 - use the talents of every person in the country and then we are setting out specific policies that can make a difference			0
' mr @entity2 has used his pallet to address crowds in @entity182 ( left ) and @entity0 the interview came after questions were raised about @entity3 ’s alternative @entity58 , which repeated the party ’s pledge to bring in a temporary vat cut to 17.5 per cent , which would cost £ 13 billion			1
it also outlined pledges to reintroduce the 10p tax rate , which could cost £ 7.3billion if restored to the previous level before @entity192 abolished it			0
@entity3 says it would base the level on how much a mansion tax would raise , which could be only £ 2billion			2
the @entity91 claim there is a £ 28billion black hole in the plans			0
@entity199 fell only slightly last year to £ 120.6billion , just £ 300million lower than in 2011 - 12			0
shadow chancellor @entity200 has previously admitted that @entity3 would have to raise borrowing in an attempt to foster economic growth , in the hope that means borrowing can be cut later			1
but mr @entity2 flatly refused to admit that borrowing would increase , angrily dodging ten different questions on the subject			2
asked yesterday whether he thinks the government needs to borrow more now , mr @entity2 told @entity40 ‘ no , well [ what ] i would say is that we need to get borrowing down			1
’ pressed again , he added : ‘ i do n’t accept that borrowing would be higher under a @entity3 government because borrowing would be lower over the medium term			2
’ asked to agree with mr @entity200 that borrowing would rise in the short - term he refused			2
@entity218 mp @entity217 branded mr @entity2 ’s performance ‘ a @entity17 ’ , while the @entity221 press office tweeted that it was ‘ a car crash ’			0
@entity218 chairman @entity223 said : ‘ @entity2 is too weak to admit what his shadow chancellor , @entity200 , has already said : that @entity3 ’s plans mean more spending , more borrowing and more debt , exactly how @entity3 got us into this mess in the first place			1
’ the grilling of @entity2 by @entity40 ’s world at one presenter @entity39 was described as a ‘ car crash ’ interview			2
here is an edited transcript : @entity240 : would it be fair to say , looking at your plans overall , that you think that the government needs to borrow more now and that ’s in order to boost growth in the @entity247 : no , well [ what ] i would say is that we need to get borrowing @entity251 : in order to produce more growth , if you were pm at the moment you would be spending and borrowing more would n’t you ? @entity255 : well i do n’t accept that borrowing would be higher under @entity3 … because borrowing would be lower over the medium @entity257 : when @entity200 was asked about this very question he was more open			1
when he was asked if he would borrow more if he were chancellor he said now and i quote ‘ that is what i would do right now ’			0
@entity255 : look the government is cutting too far and too fast			0
@entity200 is absolutely right about @entity263 : all i am asking you is to explain how you are going to boost growth and that is by spending more and that is by borrowing more if you were @entity243 at the moment , straight answer to that ? @entity255 : well i am giving you a very straight answer			2
i think borrowing would be lower under a @entity3 government over the medium @entity257 : in the medium term , but i am asking you what you would do right now ? if i made you pm right @entity276 : what we would do right now is the five - point plan for growth and jobs			1
a vat cut which i think would get our economy @entity285 : [ that ] would n’t contribute to growth tomorrow			1
if you were @entity243 now cut vat for a year you are going to spend £ 12billion and you hope you will get the money back in the medium term but you do n’t know that			2
so you will have to borrow more would n’t you ? @entity255 : no you do n’t understand @entity39 , i do n’t think you are quite accepting this point			0
why has @entity89 ’s borrowing gone from nought to £ 61billion ? why do you think that is ? @entity240 : i ’m asking you about your plans ...			0
@entity255 : no , no , but it ’s very @entity297 : i want to ask you ...			0
@entity255 : but it ’s very relevant			0
it ’s very relevant to this @entity301 : i understand you want to change the @entity303 : i am not changing the subject at all ...			0
