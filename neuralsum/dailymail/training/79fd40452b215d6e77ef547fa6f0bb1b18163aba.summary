@entity0 will shortly establish himself as the most - celebrated player in @entity3 football history			1
against @entity4 next month he is expected to win his 100th cap for @entity6 , putting him in prime position to break @entity9 ’s all - time record of 125 appearances			1
sir @entity11 is also in his sights , his goalscoring record for both @entity6 and @entity14 also within range			1
the @entity6 captain has revealed that on his frequent visits back to @entity48 , he still enjoys a game on the streets where he grew up			1
in case @entity51 and the @entity14 medical staff start worrying , he insists that it is very low intensity stuff – keepy ups and tricks rather than a full - scale game			2
nevertheless , it is a delightful image to imagine , the man who will captain @entity6 against @entity18 hanging out by a park bench with his mates and knocking a ball around			1
‘ i ’ve always believed myself to be from the streets in terms of football , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ i ’ve always played on the streets with friends and still do now and again when i get time , i go and do that			2
that is where i learnt to play football			2
there was a lot of help along the way from the academy but the majority of my football was learnt on the streets			2
former goalkeeper @entity9 ( left ) has a record 125 caps for @entity6 , while sir @entity11 ( 106 caps ) is the @entity6 ' record goalscorer with 49 goals between 1958 and 1970 @entity33 is @entity6 's most capped outfield player on 115 while @entity35 ( 108 ) is the only @entity6 skipper to lift major silverware in the 1966 @entity84 sir @entity11 ( 49 ) @entity85 ( 48 ) @entity86 ( 44 ) @entity0 ( 42 ) ‘ now and again i go back and see friends where i am from and we have a kick around			1
everywhere we go , we sit there and there is a ball			0
i ’m obviously not running around but we stand there and have a kick - around			0
i ’m back there quite a lot			0
it ’s just keepy - ups and messing around			0
’ given @entity6 ’s start to their qualifying it seems certain @entity0 will be captaining @entity6 into @entity17 and probably the @entity84 in @entity102 , 2018			1
by that time the significant @entity6 records should have been broken by him : @entity9 ’s 125 caps and @entity107 ’s 49 goals			1
‘ i could n’t imagined that when i made my first appearance for @entity6 , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ at that age you do n’t look beyond the next game			0
you are lucky and it is a privilege to play for @entity6 in the games that i ’ve clocked up			2
it ’s there now , two more games			0
i ’ve always said that i do n’t want to stop playing for @entity6 after i get 100 caps , i want to get many more after that and try to do my best for the team			1
@entity37 picked up his 107th and last @entity6 cap as skipper against @entity125 at the @entity84 @entity34 and @entity36 have also recently joined the 100 club for @entity6 but since retired @entity38 was the first @entity6 player to reach 100 caps featuring between 1946 and 1959 ‘ i used to love watching @entity6			1
i remember the @entity127 and the stand - out moment was @entity129 and what he did			0
that is when i really started watching @entity6 closely , then at @entity133 everything happened so quickly for me in terms of the progressing through the youth team and then the first team , then within six months into the @entity6 set - up			1
it is always a dream playing for @entity6 and thankfully i ’ve done it many times			1
‘ it ’s an honour to play for @entity6 , which i ’ve said many times			2
everyone has seen the likes of @entity34 , @entity37 and @entity36 in recent times pass the 100 - cap mark and hopefully i play in the next two games and i can do that			2
it will be a proud moment for me			0
’ @entity0 made his @entity6 debut as a substitute in a 3 - 1 defeat by @entity151 at @entity152 in 2003 @entity0 ’s first appearance came in controversial circumstances , a 3 - 1 defeat against @entity151 in 2003 at @entity152 in which @entity156 was heavily criticised for substituting the entire team at half			1
at least @entity156 got something right : @entity0 was one of the second - half substitutes			1
‘ it was a bit strange , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ @entity151 at @entity164 and we lost 3 - 1			0
it was a complete change at half - time			0
it was great as me and @entity169 played the second half up front together			0
we were from the same area and same school and had a few coaches coming up from the school taking the kids to watch			0
i ’d only just left school as well			0
it was a great day			0
’ @entity178 and a half years on , the century looms and then at least another two years of games			0
suddenly @entity9 ’s record of 125 caps seems well within range			1
‘ i believe so , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ i think it ’s 16 or 17 games before the @entity185 start so i obviously wo n’t be too far away then and then i have at least another two years after that			0
i ’m happy if they all fit in			0
there is no reason to think about stop playing			0

@entity0 set to become ninth @entity6 player to reach 100 caps
the *28* - year - old set to join @entity33 and @entity35 in reaching *ton*
@entity0 has @entity9 's caps *&* sir @entity11 's goal record in sight
@entity0 *admits* to still enjoying playing street football with friends
