it might not be the most stunning image to come out of space , but this picture has got astronomers very excited			2
this misshapen circle and accompanying dot are the first ever image to be taken of a planet orbiting a star over 63 light years from @entity10			1
if light travels 5.88 trillion miles in a single year , then this is an image of a planet 370.44 trillion miles away			2
@entity15 's first light image of @entity17 b , a planet orbiting the star @entity17			1
the star , @entity17 , is blocked in this image by a mask so its light does n't interfere with the light of the planet			2
beta @entity26 b is a giant planet - several times larger than @entity28 - and is approximately ten million years old the image was taken by the world 's most powerful planet - hunting instrument , the @entity15 ( @entity15 ) , and is of a 10 - million - year - old planet named @entity30 b. @entity15 has been under development for nearly a decade , but this is only the first image to be released by the instrument			1
scientists claim it is the most advanced such instrument to be deployed on one of the world ’s biggest telescopes – the eight - meter @entity43 telescope in @entity44			0
‘ even these early first - light images are almost a factor of 10 better than the previous generation of instruments , ’ said @entity45 of the @entity46 who led the team that built the instrument			2
@entity15 's first light of the young star @entity53			1
the left image shows normal light , including both the dust ring and the residual light from the central star			2
the right image shows only polarised light			0
leftover starlight is unpolarised and hence removed from this image making it clearer the @entity15 is the world 's most advanced planet hunting instrument built for the @entity43 in @entity44			1
it is designed to image extrasolar planets orbiting nearby stars			2
in 2011 , the @entity70 team was selected to carry out an 890 - hour survey campaign from 2014 to 2016 to search and characterise exoplanets around 600 stars			0
@entity15 , which is the size of a small car , detects infrared radiation from young @entity28 - like planets in wide orbits around other stars , equivalent to the giant planets in our own solar system not long after their formation			1
it does this using silicon microchip deformable mirrors to remove atmospheric turbulence , and something known as coronagraphic masks - a telescopic attachment designed to block out the direct light from a star so that nearby objects			0
‘ in one minute , we are seeing planets that used to take us an hour to detect			2
’ @entity15 , which is the size of a small car , detects infrared radiation from young @entity28 - like planets in wide orbits around other stars , equivalent to the giant planets in our own solar system not long after their formation			1
‘ most planets that we know about to date are only known because of indirect methods that tell us a planet is there , a bit about its orbit and mass , but not much else , ’ said professor @entity45			0
‘ with @entity15 we directly image planets around stars – it ’s a bit like being able to dissect the system and really dive into the planet ’s atmospheric makeup and characteristics			1
’ for @entity15 ’s first observations , the team targeted previously known planetary systems , including the well - known @entity17 system			0
they were also able to detect starlight scattered by tiny particles to study a faint ring of dust orbiting the very young star @entity123 200 lights years from @entity10			1
this dust ring which may be the debris remaining from planet formation and with previous instruments , only the edges of it could be seen			1
although @entity15 was designed to look at distant planets , it can also observe objects in our solar system			0
this image of @entity28 ’s @entity135 , for instance , can allow scientists to map changes in the satellite ’s surface composition			0
a comparison of @entity141 observed with @entity15 on the right and a composite map made from @entity145 and @entity146 and 2 data on the left ‘ seeing a planet close to a star after just one minute , was a thrill , and we saw this on only the first week after the instrument was put on the telescope , ’ said @entity148 a @entity15 staff scientist working on the instrument			1
‘ imagine what it will be able to do once we tweak and completely tune its performance			0
’ this year , the @entity15 team will begin a large - scale survey , looking at 600 young stars to see what giant planets orbit them			1
looking through @entity10 ’s turbulent atmosphere , even with advanced adaptive optics , @entity15 will only be able to see @entity28 - sized planets			1
but similar technology is being proposed for future space telescopes			0
professor @entity45 predicts that ‘ someday , there will be an instrument that will look a lot like @entity15 , on a telescope in space			0
‘ and the images and spectra that will come out of that instrument will show a little blue dot that is another @entity10			0
’ @entity15 has been under development for nearly a decade , but this is only the first image to be released by the instrument			0
scientists claim it is the most advanced such instrument to be deployed on one of the world 's biggest telescopes - the eight - metre @entity43 telescope in @entity44 ( pictured )			0

image is of a 10 - million - year - old planet , @entity190 , orbiting its star
the picture is 10 times clearer than those taken by previous instruments
in one minute @entity15 can find planets that used to take hours to detect
it was also able to find starlight scattered by tiny particles to study a faint ring of dust orbiting a very young star 200 lights years from @entity10
