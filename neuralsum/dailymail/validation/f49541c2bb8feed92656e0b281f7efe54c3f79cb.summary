the stampede by rugby ’s dinosaurs to defend that monstrous @entity3 tackle against @entity4 as perfectly legal has been as alarming as the potentially back - breaking hit itself			1
the stamp by @entity7 against @entity8 was no more than a petulant irritant which threatened no real damage but he was rightly sent off and roundly castigated by football at large			2
the rugby snobs are fond of saying that that football is a game for gentlemen played by thugs			0
not so when seen in the context of mr @entity7 ’s words of contrition for a rare blood - rush late in his honourable career			1
@entity21 lock @entity3 made a bonecrunching hit on @entity4 fly - half @entity23 @entity3 crumples @entity23 in the aftermath of his monstrous tackle on the @entity28 fly half @entity7 stamped on @entity30 's right leg shortly after coming on at the start of the second half @entity7 walks off the @entity34 pitch in what was his last appearance against @entity8 in a @entity38 shirt @entity40 ’s piece has provoked much debate , including the above tweet from @entity3 himself ... they also like to say that rugby is a game for thugs played by gentlemen			1
not with the malevolent mr @entity3 around			2
@entity7 sought forgiveness from his team - mates and fans for how his stupidity left it impossible for @entity38 to avoid sunday ’s critical @entity55 defeat			1
there has been no apology from @entity3 for a violent act 24 hours earlier which cast a pall over an otherwise heroic @entity21 victory , which came close to snatching an improbable @entity61			1
the general reaction at @entity34 was concern that an idol may have dented his legacy a little in one of his last big matches in this country			0
at @entity70 even the low - swinging charioteers gasped in horror as @entity3 came close to cutting in two @entity28 fly half @entity23			1
@entity3 has talked in the past about the beneficial impact for his teams of ‘ the big hit			2
’ that offers a disturbing insight into his view of sport and the spirit in which it should be played			0
perhaps he feels no need to explain himself this week because so many others were only too eager to do it for him			0
referee @entity85 and his video - reviewing assistant agreed that the @entity3 ’ tackle was within the regulations			1
a livid @entity88 pushed @entity3 in the face and grapples with the @entity21 man following his challenge @entity3 and @entity92 continue their disagreement on their feet as matters threaten to boil over the majority of the rugby fraternity gave vent to their customary splutterings about this being ‘ a man ’s game			1
’ not when you blind - side an opponent after he has passed the ball			1
the officials and the executives who are responsible for rugby were of a consensus that @entity3 was already committed to the tackle so therefore he was not late enough to justify a red card			1
but did he really have to go through with it at such ferocious velocity ? was it vindictive or mere happenstance ? @entity3 is not telling us but if it had happened in a street outside the stadium police may well have been called to investigate if there were grounds for an assault charge			1
the rugby authorities – with the exception of the @entity28 who are asking for the on - the - spot not guilty verdict to be reviewed – are saying he did nothing wrong			1
well , if that tackle was lawful then it explains why so many parents are discouraging their kids from playing this game			0
@entity30 gestures and points at @entity7 as the @entity38 midfielder reacts following the challenge @entity7 looks dejected after seeing red just 38 seconds after coming on for @entity38 at @entity34 if it is ok for a young man of average build like @entity23 to be hit so hard by a giant that his head is shaken around like that of a rag doll before slamming against the ground , then what chance the campaign we at @entity148 are leading for the reforms needed to prevent concussive head injuries ? if the supply of youngsters dries up , rugby ’s future will be bleak indeed			1
as for @entity3 , he has past form			2
@entity21 internationals @entity156 and @entity157 and another @entity28 cap , @entity159 , are among a lengthening list of creative fly - halves who have been hammered – and in some cases injured – by trade - mark batterings from @entity3			1
the video of his brain - rattling of @entity23 has gone viral and there is a danger of his hits becoming cult viewing			2
now this is a contact game			0
the physical element is fundamental , while the strength and courage of the combatants are very much part of its appeal			0
but there has to be a limit			0
this is sport , not war			0
@entity182 has a lot to learn from rugby about acceptance of decisions and respect for referees			0
but education is a two - way street			2
come the crunches , football officials can take into account not only the force of the impact but the intent			0
@entity23 continued to play after his mauling by @entity3 and comes up against @entity197 here @entity21 and @entity4 captains @entity198 and @entity200 listen to referee @entity85 was @entity3 well - intentioned towards @entity23 , who played even more poorly thereafter although going beyond the call of duty in carrying on ? as the decision to let @entity3 remain on the pitch came down he gave me the smug impression of someone who had got away with another one			1
no doubt it is asking too much for @entity21 to leave out the man they call their enforcer			2
but they could come to regret not taking that decision if he does something similar in the @entity215 later this year , the officials are less forgiving and they find themselves down to 14 men against the @entity217			0
as power becomes ever more important than flair in rugby , so big men like @entity3 bulk up even more muscle			2
and his own team - mates talk with increasing awe of how he targets the fly - halves he dwarfs			1
legal or not mr @entity3 , try picking on someone your own size			0
@entity230 is reportedly determined to confound his enemies in @entity232 , win over his critics at @entity234 and go on to prove himself a @entity235			0
all in preference to a £ 75 million transfer to @entity8 , @entity238 or @entity239 good for him			0
if he were to take even more money and run for home , it is unlikely greatness would ever become him			0
@entity230 is going through a fallow patch in his second year in the @entity232 capital			0

@entity3 blind - sided the @entity28 fly half when the ball was gone
referee @entity85 and his video - reviewing assistant agreed that the @entity3 ’ tackle was within the regulations
if it had happened in a street outside the stadium police may well have been called to investigate if there were grounds for an assault charge
@entity7 stamped on @entity30 and was sent off . he subsequently apologised to his team - mates and fans
there has been no apology from @entity3 for a violent act which cast a pall over an otherwise heroic @entity21 victory
