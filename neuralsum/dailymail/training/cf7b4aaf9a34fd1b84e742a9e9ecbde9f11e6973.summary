it was like an explosion in the church			2
' there are even dents in the school playground			0
the services will probably be moved into the school			0
it 's just the church building that has been affected			1
' had it happened at a time when the building was in use it would have been an absolute catastrophe			1
it is just an absolute mess			0
of course it 's upsetting but it is only a building			1
the lightning strike at @entity7 was so loud that neighbours described the sound as ' like a bomb going off ' the @entity93 it would have been ' an absolute catastophe ' if the incident had happened when the building was in use the @entity91 listed building was finished 1832 and cost £ 5,000 to build ' there used to be four pinnacles and the lightning has struck the back pinnacles			1
my guess is that if it had hit one of the front ones it would have fallen forward			0
instead large chunks have fallen through the roof			1
inside it is a mess but it is all at the back of the church not the alter			0
it looks a complete mess			0
' i have never known this to happen before			0
we have to just retain a sense of humour and regain the positives and thankfully no one was injured			0
' ' had it happened at a time when the building was in use it would have been an absolute catastrophe			1
it is just an absolute mess ' - @entity156 church warden @entity157 , 58 , said : ' i got a phone call about 7.20am saying that something had happened to the church			0
i only live down the road and i could see that one of the pinnacles was n't there			0
' it was like there had been an explosion with great pieces of stone all over the place			2
unfortunately it left five substantial holes in the roof			2
the stone is sandstone and it 's fallen from about 80ft			0
' inside it looks like a bomb has gone off , it has even blown all the electrics and blasted off the lights			0
services are going to have to be postponed for many months and months			0
' thankfully the school finished last week but they had held three performances in here and they had their end of term service on friday			0
each night of the performances there were 200 people in there			0
if this had happened any other night there could have been a lot of disruption			0
