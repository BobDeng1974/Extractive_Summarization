it 's a heart stopping moment that @entity2 , 51 , has carried with him since he was nine years old			1
@entity2 and his brother @entity3 , 11 , had set out from their family sugar cane farm at @entity6 , then a village and now a suburb of the @entity10 coastal city of @entity11 , on the morning of march 21 , 1972			1
they were only ten minutes behind their sister , 14 - year - old @entity13 who had ridden on her bicycle at 7.42am a short distance down a country lane to the @entity18 at the junction of @entity20 and @entity21 , @entity11 to catch the 8am school bus			1
they never saw their sister again the two brothers followed the same route as their sister			2
around one kilometre from home and just 300m before the youth hall , they and found @entity13 's bicycle			1
her school bag was on the ground , its contents scattered in the grass			2
her school hat lay a few metres away , in the six foot ( 183cm ) high sugar cane which lined both sides of the track			2
the bicycle was on its side , its front wheel still spinning			1
@entity3 ran home to alert their mother , @entity62 , while @entity2 waited by the bicycle			1
scouring the bush : in march 1972 local volunteers ( pictured ) searched fields and bush in a 160km radius of the @entity11 suburb of @entity6 for @entity27 , 14 , who was kidnapped on the way to school and murdered never gave up : @entity73 ( left , with searchers in a cane field ) never gave up looking for his only daughter after she was abducted , he and wife @entity62 travelling as far as @entity77 when they received news of alleged sightings of missing 14 - year - old @entity13 body dumped : police believe 14 - year - old @entity27 was kidnapped in march 1972 at @entity6 in @entity11 , murdered and her body dumped 40km inland at @entity84 where part of her skull was found in 1974 later , @entity2 would tell his parents he thought he heard @entity13 's voice from within the sugar cane , saying that her legs hurt , and muffled screams			1
he would never see or hear his sister again			2
when mrs @entity13 turned up with @entity3 , the three of them searched the area , @entity2 seeing a small creek bed clearly with marks ' where two people had walked through very recently ' , but the footprints soon became trampled over by searchers			1
in the ensuing days and weeks , hundreds of police and local volunteers walked shoulder to shoulder through the canefields and bush searching for @entity13			2
the missing girl 's father , @entity73 , accompanied his neighbours and police as they scoured more than 160 kilometres of roads , creeks and gullies in the district			2
lost innocence : as hundreds of locals gathered ( pictured ) to search , the news of @entity27 's probable abduction and murder changed attitudes and fearful parents began driving their children to school dams and properties were searched and hundreds of people interviewed			1
police followed up a sighting of three cars seen on the same morning at the spot where @entity13 went missing , and interviewed two of the cars ' owners			0
they failed to identify the third vehicle , which may have been a grey or blue @entity135 which matched the car owned by @entity138 , whose name has been associated with several child murders			0
police concluded she had been abducted and murdered and questioned several suspects , including convicted sex offenders , but no charges were laid			0
abducted and murdered : since his sister @entity13 ( pictured ) was murdered in 1972 , @entity2 said he wo n't give up finding her killer ' till i die ' the case sent shock waves around @entity77 and it changed the laid back attitude of @entity11 's population , with many parents thereafter driving their children to school			1
as @entity156 said later , ' when we were kids we could go anywhere on our farm and the neighbours			0
we ’d go off on our pushbikes , drive a tractor , go to the neighbours , mucked around with kids on our bikes			0
' we ’d have a time to be home by , and off we ’d go , bare feet , we roamed the countryside and everyone felt safe			0
i do n’t even think @entity170 and @entity171 had a lock on the door			0
' nobody would lock a door and i do n’t think anyone had anything stolen			0
you ’d walk straight into someone ’s house and the doors ’d open and there ’d be no - one home			0
' mrs @entity13 later noted that both her sons were deeply affected afterwards , particularly @entity2 who was grilled by police about what he heard in the cane , asking him , ' are you sure you ’re not telling lies ? '			2
@entity189 and @entity73 continued to search for their daughter , going as far as @entity77 after people contacted them with possible sightings of @entity13			0
two years after @entity27 vanished , a railway worker found a partial skull in grass near @entity198 , about 40km from where her brother had found her bicycle			1
@entity10 police conducted forensic tests on the skull with the help of the @entity205 and the @entity206 , but they proved inconclusive			0
last year , they put the skull into a laboratory for dna testing and made a breakthrough , matching it to dna taken from @entity27 's relatives			1
@entity214 assistant commissioner @entity213 , who will announce the breakthrough today said the remains had been returned to @entity13 ’s family ' who are obviously quite relieved and have never given up their drive to find out who is responsible for the murder '			0
@entity2 will speak about his sister at the media conference and has stated that he wo n't give up on finding his sister 's killer ' until i die '			1
the @entity227 is offering a $ 250,000 reward for information leading to @entity13 's killer			0
anyone with information should call @entity232 on 1800 333 000			0

@entity27 , 14 , vanished in 1972 on her way to school in @entity11
her younger brothers found her bicycle with its wheel still spinning
@entity2 , then 9 , thought he heard his sister 's voice in the canefield
hundreds of @entity11 locals searched the area for weeks and found nothing
a skull found two years later 40km away has now been dna tested
@entity2 's life has been *haunted* by his sister 's *disappearance*
