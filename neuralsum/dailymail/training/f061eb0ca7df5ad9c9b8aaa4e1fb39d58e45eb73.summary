whether you suffer hangovers is , in part , determined by your genes , a team of scientists has discovered whether or not you will fall victim to a monumental hangover after a night out drinking is , in part , determined by your genes , scientists have revealed			1
while the speed at which a person drinks , whether they eat before embarking on a drinking session and their tolerance for alcohol plays a part , a team of researchers believe a person 's dna will account for almost half of the reason as to why they are afflicted the morning after			1
the study examined links between the number of hangovers each individual reported experiencing in a year , and their genetic make - up , @entity32 reported			2
the team studied more than 4,000 adults from the @entity36 @entity35 to reach their conclusions			2
their findings found genetic factors accounted for 45 per cent of the difference in hangover frequency in women and 40 per cent in men			1
furthermore , the scientists discovered that those people who had the genetic variants involved in increasing the risk of suffering a hangover , also drank to excess more regularly than those lacking the hangover genes			1
they concluded that those genes , which dictate how often a person is struck by a hangover , may also control how frequently they get drunk			1
as a result , it is hoped the findings could help contribute to future research on alcohol addiction , researchers say			0
study leader , @entity61 , a psychology professor at the @entity62 , said : ' we have demonstrated that susceptibility to hangovers has a genetic underpinning			0
' this may be another clue to the genetics of alcoholism			0
' she said those who are less susceptible to a hangover , might be more prone alcohol addiction			0
the participants of the study revealed how many times they had got drunk in the last year , along with how frequent their hangovers were - telling researchers the number of days in the previous year they felt sick the day after drinking			0
and the twins taking part reported their ' hangover resistance ' - whether or not they had ever experienced a hangover after getting drunk			1
the team of researchers at the @entity62 studied more than 4,000 adults on the @entity36 @entity35 to examine the link between genes and hangovers			2
file picture scientists found a strong link between identical twins in reports of hangover frequency and resistance , suggesting there are genetic similarities that play a part in determining if a person will fall victim to a hangover			1
' with drinking alcohol , it is not " one size fits all " , ' professor @entity61 said			0
' people are different in their ability to consume alcohol without experiencing adverse consequences , such as having a hangover			0
' professor @entity61 's team did note their study was limited because people 's memories of their drinking habits , may not have been totally accurate .			0

study of @entity36 twins reveals genes are partly to blame for whether you will suffer a hangover the morning after a night out drinking
speed a person drinks , whether they eat before consuming alcohol and their tolerance *levels* will also play a part
genetic factors found to account for half of the reason for a hangover
