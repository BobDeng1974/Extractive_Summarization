@entity5 first came to police attention in 2010 while pretending to be a paramedic			2
however , because it is not currently an offence to impersonate a health professional , police found there was little they could do to stop him			1
he was eventually arrested in september 2011 for fraud and assault on a 71 - year - old woman he was living with in @entity34 , according to police			2
difficulties : police said that because it is not currently an offence to impersonate a regulated health or care professional , they found it difficult to know how to deal with @entity5 he had moved in with the woman , convincing her that he was medically trained , but in reality had no such qualifications			1
in march 2012 , he was convicted at @entity45 of using an uninsured and untaxed vehicle , three counts of battery in relation to the 71 - year - old woman , and two counts of driving without a licence			0

' @entity5 adopted personas that put him in contact with vulnerable people and in a position of trust , ' said @entity89			2
' he was well known in the community and fooled people into thinking he was qualified to administer medical care			0
' he dressed as a paramedic , drove a marked ambulance response vehicle and carried medical equipment			1
' it is not currently an offence to impersonate a regulated health or care professional , therefore it was difficult to deal with @entity5 ’s activities and behaviour			1
' it took me three years of investigation to obtain the evidence required to put @entity5 before the court for various offences linked to his activities			0
' @entity108 said @entity5 ’s case was not the first of its kind and that she was working with the @entity113 ( @entity114 ) to raise awareness and to amend legislation which protects those who are vulnerable and those who need medical care			2
paramedic @entity120 said : ' this case specifically highlights a current inadequacy in the law in that it is not currently an offence to impersonate a paramedic , or for that matter a nurse , doctor , physiotherapist or a social worker			0
' members of the public can always check to see if their paramedic or other allied health professional or social worker is registered , by visiting the www.hcpc-uk.org or doctor www.gmc-uk.org or nurses / midwives www.nmc-uk.org			0
