by @entity0 to date , solar panels have been installed in a host of locations , from roofs to open fields			2
one bit of infrastructure that has yet to be exploited though is perhaps also the largest in total area that covers @entity9 – the roads our cars drive on			2
but a company in @entity14 is hoping to change all that by creating ‘ @entity16 ’ that not only provide power but also create smart digital driving surfaces as well			1
by gathering energy for the sun it could provide energy to nearby towns and cities , and even electric cars as well co-founders @entity34 and @entity35 are currently seeking for their ambitious proposal on @entity37			1
they have developed a small segment of solar - powered road to prove their concept works			1
and they ’re hoping to one day roll it out on roads through the @entity44 and ultimately the rest of the world in their bid to provide a novel method of accessing green energy			0
@entity34 and @entity35 explain that their design has a number of uses			0
first is obviously the ability to harness the power of the sun – they say , if installed nationwide in the @entity44 , their roads could provide more renewable energy than the entire energy the country uses			2
this electricity can be transferred to nearby buildings , neighbourhoods and cities , and they claim it can also charge electric cars			1
the prototype road involves the use of inter-connected hexagons , each in turn made of 10 % recycled glass			1
each hexagon has four layers , with the technology inside providing solar functionality			0
at the bottom is a base layer of recyclable materials , such as glass , that is placed on the ground			0
above this is the support structure , which has circuitry embedded into it , and on top of these are led lights			0
within the circuitry layer can also be found the solar cells , which collect light from the sun and convert it into useful electricity			1
and finally , on top is a reinforced glass layer with traction support for vehicles , which can support trucks up to 250,000 pounds ( 115,000 kilograms )			0
the company was co-founded by husband and wife @entity34 and @entity35 , pictured at a glass recycling centre used to manufacture their prototype road , who are currently seeking $ 1 million ( £ 590,000 ) on @entity37 to begin production of their concept surface @entity16 received funding from the @entity110 in 2009 to build their prototype solar - powered parking lot ( pictured ) , which was completed at the end of march , and they are now looking ahead to begin wider production the innovative additional features that have also garnered a lot of interest			1
the leds within the layer , powered by the sun , would allow the surface to become ‘ smart roads ’			1
these can be controlled remotely and light up to provide guidance to drivers – some could warn of upcoming hazards , or others could reallocate spaces in a car park , for example the panels also contain heating elements that will instantly melt snow and ice that falls onto them			2
the heating elements , however , are powered by the regular electricity grid , which the @entity16 would be connected to			0
@entity16 estimates there is about 31,000 square miles ( 80,000 square kilometres ) of usable road surfaces in the @entity44 that could be converted into solar - powered roads			1
in 2009 they received a contract from the @entity110 to build the prototype			0
but now they are hoping for $ 1 million ( £ 590,000 ) in funding from @entity37 in order to begin mass production of the road			0
@entity34 and @entity35 say there are 31,000 square miles ( 80,000 square kilometres ) of road surface in the @entity44 that their solar panelled road could be installed on , providing not only energy but also smart road surfaces as well that can change colour to give drivers information ( artist 's illustration shown ) leds within the panels have the ability to change colour			1
this could , for example , warn drivers of upcoming hazards or reallocate spaces in a car park a heating element within the panels also makes them resistant to ice and snow			2
at the bottom are panels with the heating element turned off , while those on the top have it turned on			0

a family - run company in @entity14 have unveiled their solar road concept
known as @entity16 they have made a prototype ' parking lot '
it uses layered hexagons embedded with solar cells and other circuitry
the cells can provide power to neighbourhoods and also electric cars
leds within the panels can also be lit to make the surface into smart roads
these could give drivers *instructions* such as warning them of hazards
