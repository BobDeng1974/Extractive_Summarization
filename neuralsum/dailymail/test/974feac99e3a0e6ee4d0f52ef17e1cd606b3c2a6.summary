computers may soon be able to transmit the complexities of human personalities , the @entity1 professor who originally set up @entity3 's x laboratory has claimed			1
@entity7 , who founded the @entity9 laboratory where the internet search giant has developed @entity11 and driverless cars , said it was often difficult to grasp concepts before they come to fruition			1
but he said that , much like data is now routinely transmitted via computers , the same may soon be true for full personalities			2
' maybe we 're going to have a demo at some point where the computer runs ' @entity7 , '' he told a symposium thursday evening at @entity1			1
' it 's maybe unimaginable but it 's not as far off as people think			0
it 's very doable , ' said the @entity40 - born computer scientist , who remains a fellow at @entity3			1
' i do believe that in all these technologies we have just scratched the surface			0
' almost everything interesting has n't been invented yet , ' he said			0
other upcoming inventions predicted by @entity7 include flying cars , computers that are implantable into the human body , and medical treatments that will drastically curb unnatural deaths			1
@entity7 was speaking as part of events to mark the premiere of ' @entity56 , ' an experimental opera about the 1968 data transmission test by scientist @entity59 that helped pave the way for the creation of the @entity62			1
but @entity22 , a virtual reality pioneer known for his books on the philosophy of computers , doubted that scientists could ascertain how to share personalities			2
' you are a moving target , and the way you change yourself in response to the presence of that technology would undo any ability to measure whether it has succeeded , ' he said			0
the @entity25 giant 's patent says that one day a robot personality could replicate the robot 's owner , ' a deceased loved one , ' or ' a celebrity			2
' above it @entity82 , which according to @entity3 - owned @entity83 , is a ' high mobility , humanoid robot designed to negotiate outdoor , rough terrain			1
according to @entity3 owned @entity83 , @entity82 is a ' high mobility , humanoid robot designed to negotiate outdoor , rough terrain			1
' @entity82 can walk bipedally leaving the upper limbs free to lift , carry , and manipulate the environment			0
' in extremely challenging terrain , @entity82 is strong and coordinated enough to climb using hands and feet , to pick its way through congested spaces			0
' @entity22 warned that @entity95 puts too much faith in technology 's progress			0
' i think we are going to have a real struggle to define ourselves in a humane and sweet way as we go through a lot of changes , ' he said			0
he warned that technological innovations risked worsening inequality , saying : ' i do n't think the interests of entrepreneurs and everyone else are always aligned			0
' he gave the example of @entity111 , saying that @entity95 was too congratulatory about the role of social media in the 2011 revolution that brought down strongman @entity115			0
' when it starts to go wrong , we do n't take responsibility for that			0
' there is a way in which we are being a little selective in tallying our victories , ' he said			0
@entity3 has already developed a system to allow robots to download new personalities online			1
the system would allow machines to download them in a similar way to an app - and even have a different personality for each user			2
the patent says that the personality could replicate the robot 's owner , ' a deceased loved one , ' or ' a celebrity , ' @entity3 's patent details a cloud - based system where a personality could be downloaded to a robot , in the same way one might download an app. ' the robot personality may also be modifiable within a base personality construct ( i.e. , a default - persona ) to provide states or moods representing transitory conditions of happiness , fear , surprise , perplexion ( e.g. , the @entity153 robot ) , thoughtfulness , derision ( e.g. , the @entity157 robot ) , and so forth , ' states the patent			1
friends will even be able to clone their robots and swap aspects of its personality			2
' the personality and state may be shared with other robots so as to clone this robot within another device or devices			2
' in this manner , a user may travel to another city , and download within a robot in that city ( another ' skin ' ) the personality and state matching the user 's ' home location ' robot			2
' the robot personality thereby becomes transportable or transferable			2
' the firm also explains ' this disclosure relates to a robot imbued with a personality , or personalities			1
@entity3 's patent drawings reveal the system can share personalities and download them ' in particular , but without limitation , the disclosure provides for a robot that operates with personality attributes and related capabilities drawn from cloud computing capacities			1
' personality may be thought of as personification in the sense of human characteristics or qualities attributed to a non-human thing			0
' a robot can be programmed to provide a desired look as well as interactability for the robot , which may be subject to change by the user or by the robot itself , such that the robot interface is customized to provide a desired personality for the robot			0
' @entity3 already owns several firms developing robotic technology , including @entity82 , 6.2 feet of metal with a plastic body that can walk , run , jump and even open doors			1
this is latest version of the @entity82 robot created by @entity83 , a @entity3 - owned robot firm			1
later this year , seven of the robots will compete in a ' robo oylmpics ' - designed to recreate natural disasters the robots could one day be sent into			0
the upgraded @entity82 is 75 percent new â€” only the lower legs and feet were carried over from the original design the ' crane ' stance , being held by @entity228 @entity227 ( played by @entity229 left ) in the 1984 film inspired the latest movements of the @entity82 robot			0
it demonstrates strong balancing skills and composure and showcases the agility of the @entity3 - owned machine , said the firm			1

@entity3 has already patented system to swap robot personalities
@entity7 says system to swap personalities is ' doable '
