choosing the perfect ski destination can be a tricky prospect			0
especially if you want to take your family			0
the first instinct is to think about the @entity5			1
but if you want to go away in february half - term - which we did - then the snowiest parts of @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9 can be busy			1
we happened upon an alternative			1
fill your snow boots : @entity14 can be an inexpensive alternative to the @entity5 the slopes are snow - sure well into april , prices are reasonable and families are exceptionally well catered for			1
my wife and i have two children , @entity23 , five and @entity24 , three			0
that 's young to start skiing , but i was told that @entity27 would do the trick			1
after an easy transfer from @entity32 airport , we arrived at the @entity33 , one of two ski - in ski - out hotels			1
there is ten - pin bowling , an @entity39 - style diner , a soft play area and a vast multi-pool swimming area that would prove to be a huge hit with my lot			2
it is also right by the nursery slopes - our first morning found us riding the magic carpet to ski school			1
@entity23 was in a class of five , @entity24 was with three others			0
and by a happy quirk , they were being taught by two sisters , both delightful			0
by the second day , she was riding the mini drag lift and @entity24 was padding around on her skis , searching for stuffed toy lions and monkeys around the kids area			0
easy does it : @entity27 can be a perfect ski destination for families with young children by the end of the week , both were skiing better than i could have hoped			1
@entity27 has four main ski areas , all with excellent nursery slopes - with easy routes down from all points			1
the ski school also runs a drop - in creche from 10.45am to 3pm for £ 8 an hour per child , with a 30 per cent discount for siblings			2
we used this for our own ski time			0
the slopes are surprisingly extensive			2
@entity79 is an area with mostly black runs - and new for this season is the first of a series of new gladed trails through woods			2
@entity87 is a charming mountain hut serving its own beers , and moose shot by the owner			0
@entity92 is another must - visit mid-mountain restaurant and bar			2
it hosts free concerts for up to 5,000 people in march and april			2
the one sting in the tail is the cost of alcohol			0
a draft half - litre of beer cost me £ 6.50 and a bottle of wine £ 35			1
but the well - priced food balanced this out over the week			2
and it was not just about the skiing			0
downhill all the way : @entity27 has slopes for skiers all abilities , within quick reach of @entity32 we also took the girls dog - sledding across a beautifully scenic plateau , and our highlight of the week was a horse sleigh ride with a stop - off in a @entity125 yurt to cook hot dogs over an open fire			1
the girls definitely developed a taste for skiing , and we have a new love affair with @entity27			0
we are already thinking about going back for half - term next year			1
@entity132 ( 01273 224 068 , www.skisafari.com ) offers holidays for a family of four ( two adults , two children ) from £ 3,100 , based on a seven - night stay at the 4 * + @entity137 on a half - board basis - including flights and transfers			1
packages are now on sale for february 2016 half - term			1
children 's ski hire costs £ 30 for a week ; a five - day package of 90 - minute group lessons costs £ 100			0
children under six ski free			0
a one - week adult ski pass costs £ 160 .			0

@entity14 can be an alternative to the @entity5 for a half - term skiing break
slopes tend to be less *crowded* than in @entity7 , and are snow - sure to april
plenty of nursery slopes mean ( very ) young skiers can also feel at home
