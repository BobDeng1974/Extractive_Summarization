by @entity0 after booking a table at their local pub for a traditional turkey lunch , the @entity1 thought they had taken all the stress out of @entity6			1
until , that is , one family member ’s car broke down on the way to the meal			1
determined that husband @entity13 should n’t miss out on the £ 35 a head feast they had already paid for , @entity12 asked pub staff to wrap up his meal so he could enjoy it later			1
disgusted : @entity12 and her daughter @entity18 with the £ 35 - a - head dinner from the cricketers pub in @entity21 , @entity22 takeaway : the family asked for a dinner to be packaged and brought home after @entity27 missed the meal due to a broken down car but when she got home and opened the containers , she was shocked to discover what looked like ‘ a ready meal that had simply been heated up in some way ’			1
inside one box , she described finding a sealed plastic bag with three pieces of soggy turkey that appeared to have been pre-packed			0
‘ it looked like something i could pick up from @entity42 for £ 1.99 , ’ said the mother of four			1
‘ my husband was so upset he binned his meal and made himself a bacon sandwich instead – that was his @entity6 dinner			1
’ mrs @entity12 said she felt ripped off after paying almost £ 400 for the meal for 11 at @entity47 in @entity21 , @entity22			1
she had decided to take her family out for @entity6 lunch as a treat for her father , @entity51 , 62			0
‘ this time of year is always hard for my dad because my mum died at @entity6 some 13 years ago , so we always try to make it extra special for him , ’ said mrs @entity12 , 41			1
she booked a table at @entity47 – part of the @entity61 chain and her late mother ’s favourite pub – for a three - course lunch costing £ 35 each for adults and £ 17 each for children			2
but the dishes that were presented to the @entity68 were less than appetising			0
feeling empty : mrs @entity12 described the dinner as ' something i could pick up from @entity42 for £ 1.99 ' and said her husband threw it in the bin pub : a group of 11 went to @entity47 in @entity21 , @entity22 for @entity6 dinner , costing nearly £ 400			1
mrs @entity12 said the turkey looked like ' compressed meat ' ‘ i looked at the turkey and it looked like compressed meat , ’ said mrs @entity12 , an it worker from @entity80 , @entity22			1
‘ we all stared at our plates and were disgusted			0
we all realised that it was n’t proper turkey that had been carved off the bone			0
it was like something frozen			0
’ the main course was served with four @entity92 sprouts and six slices of carrots – and the family said the rest of the meal was no better			2
‘ our starter – prawns on a stick – tasted like it had been defrosted in the microwave			0
it was warm on the outside and freezing cold on the inside , ’ said mrs @entity12			2
‘ and the @entity6 pudding was horrible and rubbery			0
we were expecting turkey and all the trimmings and we were told that we would have all - that - you - can - eat vegetables			0
‘ but we ended up with rubbish			0
when you pay £ 35 for @entity6 dinner , you rightfully expect more			2
’ unappetising : menus at the cricketers pub in @entity21 , @entity22 , advertising their £ 35 - a - head menu she said she was most disappointed for her father , who suffers from emphysema and had saved up his pension money to pay for his meal			1
‘ my dad was upset because it cost so much money , ’ she said			0
it ruined our family @entity6			0
’ a spokesman for @entity61 said last night : ‘ while not cut from the bone in the pub , unlike in our carveries , our meat is from quality @entity133 turkeys and all of our vegetables are fresh			2
‘ usually we would not provide takeaway @entity6 dinners but our team was keen that the customer ’s husband did not completely miss out on his @entity6 meal and did their level best to help			2
