@entity2 died at his home in @entity4 , north @entity5 after suffering a haemorrhage in his digestive tract , just hours after being released with constipation			1
the night before , the 73 - year - old had waited five - and - a - half hours for an ambulance to be made available before waiting two more hours to be seen at @entity15			1
an inquest heard he had suffered with constipation in the week leading up to his death			0
on march 25 , an ambulance was called at 4pm after he reported suffering pain , but it was not until 9.30pm that an ambulance was available			0
a first responder paramedic arrived to mr @entity2 one hour and 27 minutes after the initial 999 call and a healthcare worker stayed with him until the main ambulance arrived			2
mr @entity2 arrived at @entity15 just after 9.50pm but was not seen until almost midnight , by dr @entity28 from the emergency department			1
that night , an abdominal x-ray was ordered for mr @entity2 , who worked in engineering and as a ground catering manager at @entity34 and @entity35 football clubs , which found no signs of bowel obstruction			0
dr @entity28 diagnosed mr @entity2 with constipation and , during the early hours of march 26 , discharged him from hospital			1
but shortly before 1.25pm that day mr @entity2 died at his home			1
a post-mortem examination found he had a haemorrhage in his digestive tract and coroner @entity45 said he had been incorrectly diagnosed as constipated			1
the cause of death was listed as a gastrointestinal haemorrhage , as a result of ischaemic bowel owing to atherosclerosis - or a clogging of the arteries			0
in evidence , dr @entity28 said mr @entity2 's main complaint was abdominal pain but he appeared comfortable and his pain score was recorded at two , which is deemed ' mild '			0
she said she had not asked if he had taken any pain relief as she relied on the ambulance for that			0
he 73 - year - old had waited five - and - a - half hours for an ambulance to be made available before waiting two more hours to be seen at @entity15 , pictured mr @entity45 gave a narrative conclusion at the hearing in @entity65 but made reference to the death of @entity68 , who died at his home in @entity70 , near @entity71 , in march 2013 after waiting 48 minutes for an ambulance			1
at mr @entity68 's inquest in january , mr @entity45 said it could not be ' established with certainty ' if mr @entity68 would have survived if the ambulance had arrived sooner			1
but he said it was ' probable ' if it had arrived within eight minutes he would have lived long enough to be transported to hospital for further medical treatment			0
a post-mortem examination found mr @entity2 had a haemorrhage in his digestive tract and coroner @entity45 , pictured , said the pensioner had been incorrectly diagnosed as constipated he said the loss of even a single life to a potential delay was unacceptable and he was writing to the @entity89 and @entity90 to tell them about his concerns that - unless action was taken - risks of deaths would continue			1
the @entity89 responded on march 19 - a week before mr @entity2 's death - saying problems with delays were being tackled			1
during his conclusion , mr @entity45 said the situation can not continue			0
he said : ' i know from the evidence he has undoubtedly suffered in the hours leading up to his death , as a result of not being treated quickly enough			0
' ' although the death was not as a result of that delay , i am concerned about that delay			0
' changes must happen and they must happen soon			0
' my intention is to seek assurances from them ( the @entity113 and @entity114 ) and to receive updates , tables and averages times of delays and handovers			2
' mr @entity45 said mr @entity2 's case could be a ' catalyst for change '			2
the coroner said he would raise a regulation 28 report regarding dr @entity28 's absence of knowledge regarding whether mr @entity2 had been administered pain relief , as well as her absence of knowledge on the safeguarding of discharging patients			2
a @entity114 spokesman said : ' we would like to express our sincere condolences to the family of @entity2			2
' we fully accept the coroner 's verdict and will ensure the appropriate action is taken to address the issues raised at the inquest			2
' we are working very closely with the @entity142 to minimise delays at emergency departments wherever possible			0
