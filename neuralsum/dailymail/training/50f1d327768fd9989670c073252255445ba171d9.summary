spice - obsessed @entity6 is believed to have the world 's biggest hot sauce collection - a whopping 6,000 bottles and counting the condiments line shelves , from floor to ceiling at his home in @entity16 , @entity17 , as well as being crammed into cupboards and the fridge mr @entity6 has been collecting the jars for the past 17 years he has been collecting the jars for the past 17 years and is widely thought to hold the world record for a private collection			1
mr @entity6 , who works as a staff cook at the @entity33 , said his most expensive bottle is worth about $ 900 ( £ 580 ) - a one of a kind - and the most he has ever paid for a bottle is $ 400 ( £ 260 )			1
his obsession started when his wife bought him 12 bottles as a gift in 1996			1
he said : ' it was simple enough			1
my wife @entity42 had purchased them for me for our first @entity46 together			2
' i had lined the bottles up on the kitchen counter and when our friends and family were coming over for the holidays , we would laugh and giggle over some of the funny and crude labels on the bottles - that 's what sparked the obsession			2
' mr @entity6 , who gave up a career in retail after 23 years in order to properly pursue his passion for spice , said he believes there are still ' hundreds of thousands ' of bottles still to collect the chilli fanatic 's obsession started when his wife , @entity42 , bought him 12 bottles as a gift in 1996 mr @entity6 added it 's impossible to put a price on his collection but to him it 's ' priceless ' mr @entity6 added it 's impossible to put a price on his collection but to him it 's ' priceless '			1
he said : ' i ca n't honestly say how much the entire collection is worth but i know it 's a lot - it 's impossible to put an accurate dollar amount to it			2
' i have bottles made specifically for me and many bottles from companies that are no longer in business			2
' i 've also got tons of sauces signed or autographed , and many promotional and special event sauces that makes me unable to put a price tag on			2
' among his collection are an extremely rare pair of @entity91 sauces from @entity93 's @entity92 and one of his ' prized ' items is two bottles of @entity98 's @entity97 ( caldera means ' volcanic cauldron ' ) that are incredibly hard to find			2
@entity98 's also make the @entity102 certified hottest sauce on the planet - the @entity105 this is short for 16 million @entity107 - the measurement used to gauge the pungency and spiciness of chilli peppers			2
and , of course , mr @entity6 managed to get his hands on a bottle			1
apparently , there are only 499 bottles in existence - and on specialist hot sauce websites , a bottle retails for almost £ 3,000			0
he said : ' to put how hot that is in perspective , 11 million @entity107 is hotter than most police pepper sprays in the @entity123 - they mostly range from between 2 @entity124 and 9 mil. ' it is actually not even a true sauce , it 's in crystallised form			0
and that 's pretty darn cool			0
mr @entity6 also writes for @entity131 magazine and is an old pro on the hot - sauce circuit			1
he even has his own heat tolerance competition at the shows called the ' @entity136 '			0
he said : ' it 's a seven - sauce challenge , beginning at hot and each sauce climbs a little more , getting hotter and hotter as it goes			0
' the challenge is to make it from level one all the way up to level seven without passing out on me or throwing up on my table - which does happen			0
' it 's no joke and most people quit around level number four or five			0
' only the strongest survive until the end and walk away with bragging rights and is the envy of all their friends			0
' mr @entity6 , who gave up a career in retail after 23 years in order to properly pursue his passion for spice , said he believes there are still ' hundreds of thousands ' of bottles still to collect because the industry is constantly growing			1
he added : ' i 'm not a hot sauce producer or manufacturer , i consider myself a voice , an educator of the industry i love so much			0
' i am in no way trying to sell anyone on a sauce i made			0
i am trying to sell the world on hot sauce in general			0
' what i get out of it is if the industry continues to do well , it grows not only in the @entity177 , but globally , so more sauce will be made to fill that demand and more sauce will be made for me to collect			0
' as the industry grows , so does my collection - it 's that simple			0
' ' i 've got tons of sauces signed or autographed , and many promotional and special event sauces that makes me unable to put a price tag on , ' said mr @entity6			1
