@entity1 's lawyer has condemned @entity3 's punishment of the @entity5 striker for biting @entity7 defender @entity6 as ' draconian , totalitarian and fascist ' , and said an appeal will go to the @entity9 ( @entity9 )			1
speaking just before @entity11 and @entity12 confirmed reaching an agreement for the transfer of @entity1 to the @entity16 club , @entity10 reacted angrily to @entity3 's announcement on thursday that an initial appeal from both @entity1 and the @entity19 ( @entity20 ) had been rejected			1
@entity1 had appealed against @entity3 's sanctions , which include a ban on ' all football - related activities ' for four months , a nine - match ban from international football , as well as a fine of 100,000 @entity27 francs ( £ 66,000 )			2
decision maker : @entity29 said the incident ' could not be tolerated on any football pitch ' chomping at the bit : @entity1 appears bites @entity6 during @entity5 's 1 - 0 win against @entity7 ouch : @entity6 attempts to show the bite marks to referee @entity36 bite night ! @entity1 holds his teeth after the biting incident during the @entity39 against @entity6 not fooling anyone : @entity1 holds his teeth after sinking them into the shoulder of @entity6 thumbs up : @entity1 has signed for @entity11 in a £ 75m move from @entity12 @entity45 appeal rejected the ban prohibits @entity1 from attending football matches , training with @entity5 or his club and attending functions organised by his team - a penalty which will now be borne by @entity11 following @entity1 's move			1
in an interview with @entity55 radio station @entity56 , @entity1 's lawyer @entity10 hit out at football 's global organising body and confirmed an appeal would go forward in an attempt to see the ban reduced			1
' we hope they revoke this sanction that is blatantly draconian , totalitarian and fascist , ' said @entity10			2
' the right of a footballer to work is being violated , and football should be worried about that			0
the nine ( international ) games may seem excessive , but the fact that he ca n't watch a game of football , or train or carry out his job , we are talking about unpleasant things			0
' although @entity1 initially denied biting @entity6 , claiming in his defence that he ' lost balance ' and ' hit my face against the player ' , he later issued a public apology to the @entity86 defender , who in turn accepted the apology and said the ban imposed on @entity1 was excessive			1
step 1 : @entity1 approaches @entity6 from behind during a @entity5 attack stage 2 : the @entity12 striker moves his head close to @entity6 's shoulder as he prepares to attack stage 3 : @entity1 appears to clamp his jaws down and bite @entity6 's shoulder however , neither @entity1 nor @entity6 's latest responses could persuade @entity3 to alter its stance			1
' @entity1 recognised his error but we 've seen that for @entity3 saying sorry is not an important factor , ' added @entity10			2
' justice will take its time but it will come			0
' we knew that @entity3 would uphold the ban because they are corporatists			0
we will not stop , we are going to go to the cas and we will keep taking the juridical path that is available to us			0
' if @entity1 does to go @entity9 , he could ask the court to suspend the ban pending a final decision			0
@entity9 may refuse to do so but , if it agrees , it could mean @entity1 being available at the start of the domestic season			0
the downside , however , is that if @entity9 puts the ban on hold , it means that , instead of @entity1 being banned for a month of the close season when no clubs are playing , he would instead face being out for even longer when the campaign starts .			2

@entity1 banned for four months and nine matches after biting @entity6 last month
@entity1 's lawyer @entity10 *slams* @entity3 for rejecting appeal
claims it is ' draconian , totalitarian and fascist '
says he will now go to @entity131 ( @entity9 ) in search of *success*
