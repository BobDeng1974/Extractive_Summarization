scientists believe they have got to the bottom of anal evolution			2
a team of @entity5 researchers has identified two sets of genes that cause some creatures to have a fully - functioning anus , while other only have ' transient ' ones			1
the study also reveals how some creatures , such as the penis worm , have very similar digestive systems to humans , even though they are very different species			1
' while several organ systems have been investigated , such as the nervous system , the anal opening has been largely neglected , ' dr @entity27 told @entity37			2
the study , published in the journal @entity40 , identified genes known as brachyury and @entity43 , that are crucial to the development of an anus			1
according to a report by @entity49 at the @entity37 , their study reveals how the anus is perhaps one of the most important organs in our body , helping our digestive system work			1
he notes that , interestingly , not all animals have one			0
some animals have simpler versions , in others the organ appears to be transient , while another has multifunctional anuses			2
animals that do have an anus , however , often grow to be larger , more sophisticated creatures			1
a team of @entity5 researchers has identified two sets of genes that cause some creatures to have a fully - functioning anus , while other only have ' transient ' ones in 2013 , researchers discovered that one of our earliest ancestors was a worm with no anus			1
the worm , named @entity80 , has no brain , no sex organs and no vital organs			0
the 1m worm is regarded by some scientists as a key biological link between many species			2
researchers believe the worm is a distant progenitor of humans and a host of other animals living today			0
@entity93 researchers say the worm might belong to a branch of the animal family tree called deuterostomes , of which humans are also members			0
trying to understand when and why the anus evolved is also complicated because it also appears and vanishes again within various groups of animals , such as flatworms			0
the latest study builds on earlier research which looked at the genes expressed during the development of intestines , stomach and anus in the penis worm			1
what surprised the researchers was not just that the development was the same in the worms as in humans , fish and frogs , but that exactly the same genes were involved in the process			1
penis worms live in shallow parts of the oceans , including off the @entity93 west coast where they propagate during the winter			0
' this means that the origin of the human stomach is further back in time than previously thought , probably about 500 million years ' , says @entity128 , postdoc in professor @entity130 's research group on paleobiology at @entity132			0
the team are now conducting further research into whether the anus has evolved independently a number of times among animals			0
' the pattern of presence and absence of the anus in animals is quite fascinating , ' dr @entity27 told the @entity37 .			0

@entity146 and @entity43 genes could shed light on anus evolution
they may indicate why some creatures only have a ' transient ' anus
study also reveals how some creatures have very similar digestive systems to humans , even though they are very different species
