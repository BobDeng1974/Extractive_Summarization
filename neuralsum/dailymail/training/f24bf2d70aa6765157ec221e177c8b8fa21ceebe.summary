@entity0 is now considered the world 's deadliest place for shark attacks and since 2012 six people have been killed - with the number of attacks said to be rising			1
in a bid to solve this problem , scientists from the area have fitted 320 sharks with special transmitters that track the animals ’ movements			2
if a tagged shark swims within a kilometre of any beach along the west coast , a receiver will trigger an alert , which then generates an automatic warning tweet			1
due to a rise in shark attacks off the coast of @entity0 , scientists have fitted 320 sharks in the area , including tiger sharks , pictured , with transmitters			1
if a tagged shark swims within a kilometre of a beach an alert is triggered			1
this then generates an automatic warning tweet @entity36 scientists fitted 320 sharks , including tiger sharks , great whites and bronze whaler sharks , with transmitters that track the animals ' movements			1
if a tagged shark swims within a kilometre of any beach along the west coast , a receiver in the water triggers an alert			1
this , in turn , generates an automatic warning tweet containing the breed of the shark as well as the time it triggered the alarm and the shark ’s approximate location			2
this location is based on which receiver was triggered			2
the transmitters were fitted by the @entity63 's ( @entity62 ) group and the tweet is sent from the company ’s @entity66 feed			1
each tweet details the breed of the shark as well as the time it triggered the alarm and the shark ’s approximate location			2
this location is based on which receiver was triggered			0
among the sharks tagged are tiger sharks , great whites and bronze whaler sharks			0
the tweets are used in conjunction with the lifeguard patrols and helicopter sightings			0
the @entity66 feed also keeps followers up to date with rescue missions and informs of beach closures , including those that have been closed due to shark sightings			1
each tweet is sent from the @entity66 feed , pictured , and contains the breed of the shark as well as the time it triggered the alarm and the shark 's approximate location			1
this location is based on which receiver was triggered			0
the tweets are sent in conjunction with lifeguard and helicopter patrols as well as warning nearby swimmers to avoid potentially shark - infested waters , the tags are additionally being used by researchers to learn more about the sharks ’ movements and behaviour			0
dr @entity106 , from the @entity107 told @entity108 : ‘ the battery life of internal acoustic tags is up to 10 years so the scientific data that may be collected from this shark is unprecedented			0
’ ministers have also signed an agreement allowing fishermen in the region to use bait to attract and catch sharks during the summer months			0
any sharks larger than three metres will then be killed to protect swimmers			0
despite this rise , deaths from shark attacks are rare			0
according to figures from @entity126 , people have a one in 3.7 million chance of being killed by a shark .			0

scientists have fixed transmitters to sharks around @entity0
when a tagged shark swims within range of a beach , an alert is triggered
this generates an automatic tweet with the size and location of the shark
it is sent from @entity63 's ( @entity62 ) @entity66 feed
