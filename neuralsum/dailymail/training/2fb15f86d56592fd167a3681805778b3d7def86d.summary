by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 11:50 est , 1 october 2013 updated : 12:11 est , 1 october 2013 teachers who set @entity3 to hip - hop to appeal to young people was today condemned as ‘ viciously racist ’ by a youth mentor backed by ministers today			1
education secretary @entity8 invited @entity9 to address the @entity11 party conference on the inane , dumbed down methods used by some schools to make the classics more relevant to young black children			1
mr @entity17 hit out at the use of street slang , hoodies , baggy jeans and baseball caps to make @entity24 lessons ‘ achingly cool ’			1
anger : youth mentor @entity26 used a speech to the @entity11 conference to condemn attempts to make literature classics cool mr @entity8 has faced criticism from some teaching unions for insisting pupils study literature classics by ‘ dead white men ’			1
but mr @entity36 backed the idea , insisting @entity39 plays should be studied in their original form without ‘ positively evil ’ attempts to appeal to youth culture			1
he also accused opponents of mr @entity8 's reforms who ‘ piously ’ advocate a more inclusive curriculum display ‘ staggering levels of hypocrisy ’ as they have often enjoyed a ‘ @entity49 , @entity51 humanities education ’			1
mr @entity17 is a writer and broadcaster who runs a youth programme in @entity54 , south - @entity55			0
he said the ‘ pernicious rush to relevance ’ in classrooms was actually harming the children it is designed to help			0
mr @entity17 told the conference in @entity67 : ‘ floundering as we now are under the sisyphean burden of political correctness , teachers are hell - bent on making everything achingly cool and hip as they think that this is the only way young people will engage and learn			1
mr @entity17 hit out at the use of street slang , hoodies , baggy jeans and baseball caps to make @entity24 lessons ' achingly cool ' ‘ this obsession with relevance is not only massively condescending but it 's also shooting the very people it is ostensibly setting out to help in the foot			1
‘ the truth is @entity83 does not need a hip - hop soundtrack for young people to enjoy it or understand it			2
it 's been doing just fine for the last 400 years			0
‘ it 's not only incredibly patronising but also viciously racist to think that black and brown kids in the inner cities will only get @entity3 if it 's set to a hip - hop beat and presented in three - minute @entity93 - style chunks			0
‘ it is positively evil to deny inner city kids access to the manifold joys of hearing their national poet 's true voice , in essence their birthright , simply because of a culture of low expectations			0
‘ with absolutely staggering levels of hypocrisy the overwhelming majority of those who denigrate the canon and who piously advocate a more inclusive , easier , “ down wiv da kids ” , curriculum are often metropolitan liberals who have themselves enjoyed the massive intellectual and social benefits of a @entity49 , @entity51 humanities education , with what 's more , i 'll wager , absolutely no hip - hop whatsoever			2
’ mr @entity17 said it was ‘ blindingly obvious ’ that an academic curriculum focused on the classics would better enable young people from disadvantaged backgrounds to achieve their potential			1
black and ethnic minorities who read classic white authors should not be accused of ‘ selling out ’ , he said			2
mr @entity17 told the conference : ‘ you can of course be fiercely proud of your @entity130 , @entity131 or black @entity129 roots and ardently love @entity133 , @entity134 and @entity135			2
‘ the two are in no way mutually exclusive and they certainly do n't make you any less black or less brown by reading them			2
‘ only an intellectual amoeba would assert that studying the canon is tantamount to selling out , to being a coconut or an @entity142			0
’ support : chancellor @entity144 ( left ) and education secretary @entity8 were in the audience for mr @entity17 ' speech he went on : ‘ i 'm so tired of the vacuous pc educationalists and the hand - wringing liberals that take great offence at @entity8 's championing of a bunch of dead white men and what they perceive to be arcane , difficult books			1
books which they claim have no relevance whatsoever to modern multicultural @entity129 and to the lives of @entity160 , @entity161 , @entity162 or @entity163 in the inner cities			0
‘ as any sane , sentient and intelligent person knows those doing the carping are speaking utter nonsense			0
’ he went on : ‘ to deny kids in the inner cities access to such mind - expanding , life - affirming and potentially life - changing authors is not only undeniably selfish and wrong but is actually positively nefarious			0
‘ that there is a positive correlation between an academically rigorous canonical curriculum and enabling young people , especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds , to truly achieve their potential in a highly competitive , modern world is frankly so blindingly obvious that even @entity181 could see it			0
