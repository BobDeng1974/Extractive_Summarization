by @entity0 published : 09:20 est , 4 february 2013 updated : 09:35 est , 4 february 2013 we 're all in this together - but not if you 're an @entity3			1
a new study by psychologists at @entity6 has found that @entity3 are n't driven by a sense of community			1
and calls to @entity3 to act interdependently , rather than independently , could even make things worse			1
so if you 're trying to get people to do something like recycling , it 's better to stress that it 's good for them individually rather than pointing out the wider benefits			2
president @entity18 urged @entity3 to work together in his inauguration address - but he might have done better stressing the maverick quality of his fellow citizens , according to the @entity6 researchers all in it together ? white @entity3 students were less motivated when prompted to think about interdependence , the researchers found ' @entity3 culture stresses independence , and the desire for independence fuels behaviour , ' says @entity30 , one of the study 's authors			1
' people often like the idea of working together and certainly care about social issues			2
but our findings show that thinking about and caring about others does n't always translate into effective action			0
' president @entity18 urged his fellow citizens to think more about the wider community at his second inauguration last month			0
being selfish really does make us happier , researchers have found - so long as we can avoid feeling guilty			0
although we are taught the benefits of kindness and altruism , it seems we are happiest when simply told to pursue our own self - interest			1
researchers found the key to contentment is feeling we have no choice but to be selfish			0
in contrast , the study , carried out by psychologists at the @entity55 , found that those who actively choose a selfish path usually have to battle with guilt			1
they speculated that because we ’re taught as children that ‘ sharing means caring ’ , if we make a decision out of self - interest over others			0
but that frequently means we forego the things we know will make us happy			0
psychological scientists @entity67 and @entity69 of the @entity55 carried out tests to see when people feel happiest			0
in one they recruited 216 undergraduates and gave them each 3 dollars			0
some were told to donate it to the charity @entity78 , some were told to keep the money and some participants were told that they could choose what to do with it			2
those students told to keep the money for themselves reported being far happier with the outcome than those who were told to donate the money and those who were free to choose			1
mr @entity67 said : ' often what people really want to do is act in a selfish manner			0
' but they do n’t do that , because they know they would feel selfish if they did			0
' the research is published in @entity99 , a journal of the @entity101			0
in his speech , he said : ' the @entity3 people can no more meet the demands of today 's world by acting alone			1
' but @entity18 might have been better to appeal to the independently minded @entity3 as mavericks			1
the @entity6 researchers carried out three challenges to test the participants ' motivation			0
in the first experiment , participants – all @entity6 students – were given difficult word puzzles to solve			2
in the second , they were given a physical challenge to see how long they would stick at it			0
during both tasks , participants were primed to think either about independence or about interdependence			2
after the initial priming , the researchers found that white @entity3 participants were less motivated to persist at these challenging tasks when they were encouraged to think of the broader good , or interdependence			1
when working together , the students were less persistent in solving difficult puzzles and applied less physical pressure in a test of their strength			2
in the third experiment , designed to test these motivational effects in relation to a pressing social issue , students were asked to give their opinions about a class on promoting environmental sustainability after viewing a website about the course			2
when the course description emphasised working together , being adaptive and taking others ' views into account , white @entity3 students predicted they would put less effort into the course			1
they said they were less likely to agree that taking the course should be a university requirement than when the course description emphasised taking charge , being unique and knowing your own perspective			0
however , the motivation of @entity158 students did not change across the three tasks			1
the researchers noted that @entity158 - @entity3 students are exposed to both mainstream @entity3 culture , which stresses independence , and @entity164 , which stresses the value and importance of interdependence			1
as a result , appeals to think and act interdependently or independently were equally motivating			2
' currently , if we want to inspire @entity3 to think and act interdependently , it may work best to actually emphasize their independence to motivate them to do so , ' @entity30 said			1
' tell them , " be the change you want to see in the world " instead of " we 're all in this together "			0

study says appeals to @entity3 ' individuality more likely to motivate
white @entity3 students made less effort when told to use *teamwork*
however @entity158 were moved by appeals to interdependence
