by @entity0 for the @entity1 tax officials must not be given powers to seize money directly from people ’s bank accounts because they are not competent enough , a banking chief has warned			1
@entity9 , chief executive of the @entity8 , also said he had ‘ real concerns ’ that the proposals could breach people ’s human rights			1
his hard - hitting letter to chancellor @entity15 is the latest twist in the growing controversy about a plan that has triggered ferocious opposition from accountants and mps			0
@entity9 , chief executive of the @entity8 ( pictured ) , said he had ‘ real concerns ’ that the proposals to allow money to be seized from people 's bank accounts could breach customers ' human rights under the new powers , @entity27 will be able to take cash directly from a current account , joint account or @entity32 to settle an unpaid tax bill			1
around 17,000 people a year will have money seized under the proposed new powers , known as the ‘ direct recovery of debts ’			1
each will typically owe £ 5,800			0
but mr @entity9 wrote : ‘ for these proposals to work as intended , @entity27 ’s tax assessments , systems and processes would have to be sufficiently robust that the likelihood of @entity27 mistakes in the application of these powers could be reduced to a negligible risk			1
‘ @entity27 ’s performance can not yet be considered as sufficiently competent to wield an unchecked power this strong			1
’ mr @entity9 raised fears that the proposals might contravene the @entity53			0
‘ we have specific concerns about how the proposals would interplay with the @entity53 , ’ he wrote			1
‘ we are not persuaded that the rights of those affected by the proposals , including the vulnerable , family members and those erroneously affected , are sufficiently protected			2
’ @entity27 says it will only target those who owe £ 1,000 or more and have been contacted at least four times			2
it argues that it is wrong to let a tiny minority , who can afford to pay their taxes but refuse to do so , to get away with it			0
but the @entity8 fears @entity27 will target not just ruthless tax dodgers , but also ‘ a significant number of unintentionally non-compliant , vulnerable taxpayers ’ , such as the elderly			1
under the new powers , @entity27 will be able to take cash directly from a current account , joint account or @entity32 to settle an unpaid tax bill and it is thought around 17,000 a year would be affected ( file picture ) mr @entity9 wrote : ‘ we believe that the proposals could have a negative impact on the frail and vulnerable and could undermine public faith in the tax system			1

in the @entity90 recently , @entity89 peer lord @entity88 , who is 77 , revealed his experience with @entity27 , which he described as an ‘ out - of - control computer juggernaut			2
’ he had promptly paid £ 992.62 he owed , but was pursued for the money for the next four weeks , threatened with debt collectors and faced charges for late payment			0
lord @entity88 said : ‘ @entity27 has no control over its computer system , which dementedly sends out demands for weeks on end			2

nearly £ 4million of tax was written off			0
a @entity119 spokesman said : ‘ there is no question of those who genuinely can not pay being affected – the safety of vulnerable customers is a priority and the government is proposing robust safeguards			0
