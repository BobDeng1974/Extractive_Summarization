by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 when a young footballer receives his first wage packet , you would expect them to treat themselves to something nice and maybe expensive			0
but @entity9 midfielder @entity8 did something a bit different - he paid for his dad @entity12 to have cancer treatment			1
in a @entity15 with fans on thursday night , the 28 - year - old was asked what he did with his first wage			0
generous : @entity8 , pictured as a @entity20 player in 2006 , gave his first wage packed to his father to fund his cancer treatment fans ' favourite : @entity8 ( left ) is well liked by supporters at @entity9 @entity26 : just after his latest injury , @entity8 announced his engagement to @entity30 his answer was : ' gave it all to my dad for his cancer treatment ' , which elicited the response ' @entity36 bless you @entity8 '			2

it ’s such a cliché , but if i could be half the man he was , i will have lived a good life			0
he always put his family first no matter what			0
' it was n't all sweetness and light in the @entity15 , however , as the midfielder did manage to have a sly dig at @entity53 defender @entity52 , who broke his leg with a reckless challenge in 2011			1
despite having previously said he forgave the @entity56 for the tackle which put him out for six months , when asked if he liked @entity52 , @entity8 replied : ' hmmmmmmmmmm ! ' @entity8 , who has played just nine matches since that tackle at @entity61 , is currently out for six to nine months after a knee operation for an injury sustained in a reserve match against @entity65			2
however he has rejoined the @entity9 first team for training and will hope that his contract , which is up in the summer , will be renewed			0
