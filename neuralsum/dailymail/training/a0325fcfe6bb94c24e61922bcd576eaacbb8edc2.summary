by @entity0 for the @entity1 another hurricane is heading our way - but rather than battening down the hatches , it might be time to reach for the sunglasses			2
@entity9 , which is gathering speed in the @entity11 , is forecast to narrowly miss @entity12 at the end of the week			1
experts say it will drag an area of high pressure behind it , creating a dry , warm and sunny start to september - a welcome relief after the end - of - august washout created spectacular scenes over the @entity24 cliffs in @entity25			1
pictured are the cliffs at @entity24 , @entity25 storm 's end : much of @entity12 has been hit by miserable weather , but a rainbow shone through the gloom today on the @entity25 coast beauty spot : the cliff range in @entity40 is one of the most visited on the south coast and is also home to the famous @entity44 @entity28 taking shape over the @entity11 on august 25			1
it is forecast to narrowly miss @entity12 next week - but drag behind it warm , dry and sunny weather the remnants of the last @entity50 storm , @entity51 , struck the @entity12 a fortnight ago causing dramatic downpours and some flash flooding			1
but the tail - end of @entity28 is likely to veer north and miss us , sucking a warm air mass up from @entity57 and creating at least a few days of dry weather			1
it will come as a relief after a sodden @entity61 weekend and a bitterly cold week			2
@entity9 , which last night whipped across the @entity50 at 75mph and dumped 4 inches ( 10cm ) of rain on @entity63 , is expected to move up the east coast of the @entity65 before hurtling across the @entity66			1
though showing a similar path to @entity68 which caused havoc at the beginning of august , it is not expected to have anywhere near the same impact on @entity12 ’s weather when it arrives at the weekend			1
according to @entity65 ’s @entity75 , @entity28 will weaken to a storm as it moves towards @entity78 on sunday			1
divine intervention ? the striking shaft of light on the @entity40 cliffs made them look almost as if they were being smiled upon from above idyll : the @entity86 said after a generally unsettled picture this week the hurricane 's tail could trigger more wind and rain in some regions in the north unlike @entity51 , which tracked right across the @entity12 , the remnants of @entity28 are unlikely to hit the country directly but instead veer to the north			1
the @entity86 said after a generally unsettled picture this week it could trigger more wind and rain in some regions			2
forecaster @entity100 said : ‘ we might see a bit of wind and rain in the northwest from the remnants of @entity28 on sunday and it might get a bit breezy			2
‘ for many places @entity28 could bring some decent weather at the weekend by dragging high pressure towards the @entity12			1
’ @entity111 spokesman @entity110 added : ‘ the latest model is that the tail - end of the storm will go to the north of @entity12 on monday over @entity116 and @entity117			2
‘ following behind will be a region of high pressure			0
it will be dryer and more settled than we have seen recently			0
unsettled : horse riders take a coastal trip along @entity123 in @entity124 today , passing the red and white @entity125 under a blanket of foreboding clouds time to make hay ? a train runs along the mainline today behind newly harvested fields near @entity132 , @entity133 , after more wet weather was forecast ‘ that is likely to last through the middle and maybe the late part of next week , when it looks sunny and dry for many , with temperatures in the low 20s			1
’ @entity28 has already caused at least five deaths in the @entity50 islands , officials said			1
the @entity143 in @entity144 said the hurricane would likely avoid a collision with the @entity65 @entity147 , but it was creating dangerous surf and rip conditions off the coast			2
the @entity151 and @entity152 cancelled flights after the hurricane dumped 12 inches ( 30cm ) of rain on the islands over the weekend			0
some 640 families in @entity157 have been left homeless during the passage of the storm			0
ominous : this funnel cloud appeared above caravans in @entity162 , @entity163 holidaymakers were treated to another sign that summer could be over - a sinister - looking funnel cloud in grey skies above the seaside			2
the ominous shape formed yesterday above @entity162 , @entity163 , on tuesday after days of heavy rain			0
described as a ' funnel cloud ' because its base did not touch the ground , it forms when a combination of high winds and high humidity causes condensed water vapour to spin in a vortex			0
it was caught on camera by @entity182 , who was on holiday with his two children and was stunned to see the mini storms circling above their caravan			0
@entity182 , 39 , a gardener from south east @entity187 , said : ' it had been raining for the past few days and i was just sitting outside when these mini twisters started to form			0
' there were a few just sprouting up and then breaking away			0
i have never seen anything like it in my life			0
' at first we were a bit scared because we thought on big one could form			0
i mean it was really windy and the trees were getting hammered			0
' then all of a sudden they just broke up and went away			0

@entity28 forecast to narrowly miss @entity12 next week - but drag behind it warm , dry and sunny weather
it is expected to miss @entity65 east coast then hurtle across @entity66 after causing at least five deaths in @entity50
washout end to august has produced spectacular scenes *including* rainbow over @entity24 cliffs in @entity25
