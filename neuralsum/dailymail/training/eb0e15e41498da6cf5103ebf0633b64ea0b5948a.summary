in the dark world of @entity1 1984 , the ‘ proles ’ are forced to read meaningless poetry written by a computer			1
it might seem like a far - fetched scenario , but @entity1 may have touched upon a future trend when he published his novel in 1949			0
today , computers can do anything from interact with humans to predict their behaviour – and one could someday become the next poet laureate			1
the site lets you play a game titled ' bot or not ' to see if you can distinguish if a poem was written by a computer or a human the @entity22 website , created by @entity24 @entity23 and @entity25 , reveals just how adept computers have become at writing poetry			1
the site lets you play a game titled ‘ bot or not ’ to see if you can distinguish if a poem was written by a computer or a human			1
it describes itself as a ‘ turing test for poetry ’ and once you select your answer , it will reveal how the chosen poem was created			1
the site describes itself as a ' turing test for poetry ' and once you select your answer will reveal how the chosen poem was created in 1950 , @entity40 devised the turing test as a way of verifying machine intelligence			1
the turing test is a proposed a situation in which a human judge talks to both a computer and a human through a computer terminal			0
the judge can not see the computer or the human , but can ask them questions via the computer			0
based on the answers alone , the human judge has to determine which is which			0
for instance , more than three - quarters of quiz - takers incorrectly predicted that that @entity61 ’s ‘ @entity60 ’ was written by a machine			2
‘ computer generated poetry means different things to different people , ’ according to the website			1
‘ what we mean by “ computer - generated poetry ” is : text , that is generated through an algorithm , which is executed by a digital , electronic computer , which is intended , by whoever it may be , to be read as poetry			2
’ computer - generated poems can be written using a variety of techniques			0
for instance , developers have created a machine - learning algorithm capable of collaborating with @entity82			1
it is n't just poetry generated in human form that is gaining popularity			2
in december , @entity87 held its first code poetry slam to reveal the literary side of computer code the machine - learning software , dubbed ‘ fluency ’ , analyses the style of @entity82 's sonnets			1
developer @entity95 was then able to write a new sonnet choosing words from the suggestions generated by the algorithm			0
‘ as might be expected from an artificial intelligence , the result is full of mixed metaphors , ’ mr @entity100 said , writing in @entity102 ’s blog			2
as well as using @entity107 ’s engine , mr @entity100 also built a visual interface to help in poetry creation and named this project ‘ @entity111			2
’ using this interface , he was able to co-create poetry in the style of various authors including @entity116 and @entity117			2
machine - learning software , dubbed ‘ fluency ’ , analysed the style of @entity82 's sonnets			0
@entity95 was then able to write a new sonnet choosing words from the suggestions generated by the algorithm and it is n’t just poetry generated in human form that is gaining popularity			0
in december , @entity87 held its first code poetry slam to reveal the literary side of computer code			0
@entity131 , a student at the university , wore @entity133 as she typed 16 lines of computer code that were projected onto a screen while she simultaneously recited the code aloud			0
she then stopped speaking and ran the script , which prompted the computer program to read a stream of words from @entity142 out loud three times , each one in a different pre-recorded - computer voice			0
ms @entity131 said the slam proved computers can be poetic , and as the @entity22 or not website proves , it ’s not always easy to tell the difference between man and machine .			1

' @entity22 or @entity154 ' site was created by @entity23 and @entity25
@entity156 reveals how many people believe poem was by man or machine
it reveals just how adept computers have become at writing poetry
*earlier* this year , a machine was shown to ' collaborate ' with *shakespeare*
