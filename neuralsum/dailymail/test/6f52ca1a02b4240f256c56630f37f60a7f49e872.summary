a good samaritan was given a parking ticket after he pulled over to help an elderly woman he thought was dying			1
student @entity4 , 21 , stopped in the first space available when he saw the pensioner collapse on the pavement			1
but as he helped her for less than a minute , a traffic warden put a £ 70 ticket on his car – because mr @entity4 had pulled into a bay for disabled drivers			1
' it 's ridiculous ' : when he was slapped with the ticket on his windscreen mr @entity4 initially tore it up and threw it in the bin before later going back to pick it up yesterday mr @entity4 said the way he had been treated was ridiculous and said the council warden could see what was happening			1
he was driving through @entity24 when he saw the woman fall to the pavement			1
he parked and rushed over to help			0
after discovering she was all right and helping her to her feet , he returned to the car only to find the warden printing the ticket			1
‘ i stopped in the disabled bay as it was the nearest place to where the old lady was , ’ he said			1
angry : mr @entity4 , who is studying marketing and advertising at @entity38 , said he was punished for trying to do something good ‘ there was a space for about four cars and it was completely empty , so it was n’t like somebody was waiting to use it			1
under the circumstances , i think it was ridiculous			0
i saw her fall down and stopped for around 30 to 45 seconds at the most to help her			2
‘ i went back to my car and there was a parking officer who was giving me a ticket			2
he must have seen what i was doing and that i was helping the old lady			0
' i asked him why and he said , “ it gives me no great satisfaction to give you this ticket ”			2
any normal person would have turned a blind eye when they saw why i had stopped			2
’ the undergraduate , who is in his final year of an arts and marketing degree at @entity38 , took a photo of the smirking traffic warden during the incident on april 9 and posted it on @entity68			2
where it happened : the student was driving along @entity72 , @entity24 , when he saw a pensioner lying on the pavement in nearby @entity75 ( circled )			2
he pulled into the disabled bay shown above good samaritan : @entity4 , 21 , was given a parking fine after stopping to help an elderly woman he at first tore up the ticket and threw it in a bin but later retrieved it			1
‘ it ’s not the cost , it ’s the principle , ’ he said			0
‘ i tried to do something good and then something bad happened because of it			0
’ he was supported by other social media users			0
one , @entity89 , said : ‘ i ’m sorry you got a ticket @entity92 ( make sure you appeal against it ) but well done for helping the lady who fell over			0
' this does n’t surprise me			0
parking services are well known for slapping out tickets in circumstances where common sense should prevail			0
the council does n’t care , as long as the revenue keeps rolling in			0
’ @entity103 posted a message to mr @entity4 on @entity68 suggesting how he could challenge the ticket			1
@entity97 operations manager @entity106 said : ‘ any motorist receiving a fine can appeal against a ticket … we give full consideration into all individual cases and take mitigating circumstances into account			0

@entity4 , 21 , stopped as he thought an elderly woman was dying
he pulled over in a space *reserved* for disabled *people* and ran to help her
but as he *tended* to pensioner a warden slapped a ticket on his windscreen
@entity103 say appeals procedure is available to mr @entity4
