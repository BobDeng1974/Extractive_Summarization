as the @entity20 glides towards the earth , floodlights over the runway illuminate the spirals of fog left in its wake			0
wingtip vortices are circular patterns of rotating air left behind by a plane 's wing , while the downwash refers to the air forced down by the aerodynamic action of the wing in motion			0
the phrase ground effect describes the increased lift and decreased drag a plane 's wings generate when they are close to the earth			0
patterns : the wings of the plane create swirls in the fog over the runway at @entity13 stunning : the wings of the @entity62 air jet create spirals in the clouds of fog in the night sky touch down : the illuminated fog illustrates the downwash , the ground effect , and the wingtip vortices video : watch the effect created as the plan lands on a foggy runway			1

footage of jet landing on foggy night illustrates effect plane creates on air
@entity11 @entity20 leaves a trail of spiralling patterns through the fog
