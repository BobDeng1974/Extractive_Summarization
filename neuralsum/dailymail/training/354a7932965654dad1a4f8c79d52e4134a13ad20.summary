by @entity0 published : 20:32 est , 18 august 2013 updated : 00:49 est , 19 august 2013 a @entity2 businessman who bought a prime lakefront lot for $ 760,000 claims he was shocked to learn after building his dream home that the land was saddled with a $ 12.6million debt			1
the debt prevents him from ever seeing a cent if he sells the property and has sparked a fierce legal battle			0
@entity13 , a successful @entity15 builder , is now suing a real estate broker and the high - powered lawyer who drew up the legal papers , claiming they knew - or should have known - about the massive lien filed against the property			1
not a penny : home builder @entity13 will not receive a penny if he sells his $ 3.45million dream home because of a $ 12.6million debt on the property mr @entity13 invested at least $ 1.4million in the property when he built this sprawling 85,000 - square - foot one - story mansion			1
it features an in - ground swimming pool , three bedrooms and gated driveway @entity30 , and the lawyer , @entity31 , are a father - son team			0
they are also the men who sold the property and , mr @entity13 alleges in his lawsuit , they were involved in the deal that led to the massive debt being placed on the land			2
mr @entity13 is seeking $ 12.6million in damages , plus interest			1
he says he wants to pay off the $ 12.6million lien so he can sell the house and be done with it , according to the @entity44			1
the defendants in the case declined comment to the @entity44			0
they could not be reached by @entity48			0
mr @entity13 bought the two - acre parcel , which sits in a wealthy subdivision on @entity51 in @entity52 , in 2011 for $ 760,000			1
he then invested at least $ 1.4million on a home			2
the sprawling 8,500 - square - foot one - story mansion features a massive in - ground swimming pool , three bedrooms , an outdoor summer kitchen and a driveway guarded by a gate			0
in the lawsuit , mr @entity13 , who owns contracting company @entity60 , says the property is now worth $ 3.45million			2
mr @entity13 said he bought title insurance , but the policy only covers the cost of the land - not the massive $ 12.6million debt encumbered on the property the house has lakefront access and is situated in an upscale subdivision of @entity52 , an @entity15 suburb mr @entity13 said he has title insurance , but it only covers the cost of the land - a fraction of the massive lien			1
the debt against the property was laid down in a neighboring county , so a routine title search in @entity83 - home of @entity52 - did n't show an encumbrances			0
if mr @entity13 sells , the entire sum will go toward the $ 12.6million debt against the property			1
as with most bad land deals in @entity2 , this one traces its origins back to the collapse of the @entity92 housing market			0
the property originally belonged to @entity93 , a major @entity2 real estate developer			2
in 2008 , mr @entity93 borrowed $ 650,000 from @entity30 and @entity31 and offered the two - acre @entity95 parcel as collateral , the @entity44 reports			2
when mr @entity93 's $ 20million hotel redevelopment project in @entity99 failed in the housing crash , a judge entered a $ 12.6million judgement against him and placed a lien against the property , according to the newspaper			1
mr @entity93 's lawyer declined comment to the @entity44			0
he could not be reached by @entity48			0
because mr @entity93 also owed the @entity107 money from the $ 650,000 loan , they took ownership of the parcel - and the $ 12.6million lien along with it , the @entity44 reports			1
the lawsuit alleges that because the @entity107 were involved with mr @entity93 , they had to have known about the debt when they sold the land to mr @entity13			0
or or they did n't , mr @entity13 alleges , they should have .			0

@entity13 bought the two - acre @entity2 property in 2011 and built a $ 1.4million house on it
he learned after the construction that a judge had placed at $ 12.6million lien on it because of a debts from a previous owner
