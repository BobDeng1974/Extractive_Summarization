they 're the first tintypes created in a combat zone since the @entity2			1
seeking to capture the humanity of his peers fighting in the @entity9 war , @entity5 aerial gunner @entity3 asked them to sit for photos on the battlefield			1
while the process was painstaking and laborious - when duty called , the @entity16 - based photographer dropped his camera and jumped into a helicopter - the images were gripping			0
@entity3 was on active duty in the @entity21 as a helicopter aerial gunner with a @entity24 @entity23			1
' to do this process in a war , let alone a foreign war , is historically significant , ' @entity3 told the @entity28			1
' the process of wet - plate tintypes is challenging enough with perfect conditions and the availability of chemicals			2
in a foreign war , with the stresses of combat , lack of basic materials , drying desert air , and the wind and dust of @entity9 , it was quite a challenge			1
' the spectacular images can be viewed at his website @entity46			0
@entity3 's images are the first combat zone tintype photos created since the @entity2 @entity3 said it was tough convincing his peers to sit through the tedious photo shoot @entity3 was staff sergeant in the @entity5 and deployed to @entity21 , @entity9 , as a helicopter aerial gunner with a @entity24 @entity23 when he captured these images @entity3 said taking tintype pictures in a war zone was ' historically significant ' according to @entity57 , tintype ' is a slow , laborious wet plate process that is difficult to master and work with in warm temperatures '			1
introduced in the mid-nineteenth century , this artistic process was used to document the @entity2			2
it involves hand - pouring a collodion mixture onto a metal plate , which is then made light sensitive in a darkroom via a silver nitrate solution			2

' as a photographer and artist i wanted to achieve something that was physical , one of a kind and very unique , ' he told @entity80			0
' i believe in the @entity82 aesthetic of ' @entity83 ' so the idea that something is imperfect and impermanent interests me			0
' i wanted that to translate in my @entity9 images as metaphors for what i experienced in the war , i thought tintypes to be the perfect photographic process to translate @entity83 in my portraits			1
' the stresses of combat , lack of basic materials , drying desert air , and the wind and dust of @entity9 challenged @entity3 's artistic ability while @entity3 's peers were initially reluctant to sit for him , they went back for more after seeing the incredible results @entity3 photographed his fellow soldiers in the front of the @entity23 rescue helicopters they flew @entity3 chose tintype photography because he ' wanted to do a process that was historical , but also made me take my time and work slowly to focus on my subject			1
