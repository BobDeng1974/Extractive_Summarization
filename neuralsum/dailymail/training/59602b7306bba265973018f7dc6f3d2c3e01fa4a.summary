the bizarre moment a cat - like wild genet hitched a ride on some of @entity5 ’s biggest beasts has been captured by a hidden camera trap			1
the animal was spotted riding around on the back of both a rhino and a buffalo			1
and while its exact motives were unknown , it has been suggested that it may perch there and wait for small prey to be flushed out by the beasts before pouncing			1
a genet has been photographed on top of @entity19 beasts in @entity5			1
the remarkable incident took place at @entity22 in the images the genet can be seen hitching a ride on a rhino ( shown ) and a buffalo the amazing incident took place at @entity22 in @entity5 but the peculiar antics would have gone unnoticed if it was n't for a well - placed hidden camera set up by local conservation organisation , @entity32 , that uses the traps to monitor endangered species and help catch would be poachers			1
incredibly , the strange moment was caught on camera not once but twice and @entity32 's volunteer rangers are confident it is the same genet each time			1
in fact , the rangers believe this is the first time behaviour like this has ever been recorded in the wild			0
a genet is a mammal that resembles a cross between a cat and a mongoose			1
they have spotted coats , long banded tails , small heads and large ears			0
they are very agile and have very quick reflexes , with excellent climbing skills			0
in the images the type of animal is a large - spotted genet			2
they mostly dwell in trees and prey on birds , frogs , insects and rodents according to @entity69			2
and they have apparently also been known to kill baby antelopes despite their much smaller size			0
the feline , which has since been named @entity75 - genet is pronounced ' jen - it ' - has even become something of an online celebrity and now has its own @entity80 account			2
in the images the cat - like creature is seeing riding atop both a rhino and a buffalo			1
other species have been spotted interacting before , notably impala and baboons , with the former using the latter as an ‘ alarm system ’			0
but according to @entity92 at @entity32 , this is the first time these two species have been seen together			0
‘ what makes it even more interesting , is that it ’s not the first time this has happened , ’ she writes			0
‘ according to other camera trap images this is ongoing behavior by the same genet			2
’ camera traps are used to monitor wildlife without invading on their privacy			0
they are triggered by movement and use a non-irritating flash			0
studying the photographs can reveal the movements and behaviour of animals when they are not otherwise observed			0
incredibly , the strange moment was caught on camera not once but twice and @entity32 's volunteer rangers are confident it is the same genet each time it 's thought the creature may be doing this to spot prey from above			1

‘ what makes it even more interesting , is that it ’s not the first time this has happened , ’ she writes although a little baffled by the bizarre behaviour , dr @entity140 , an expert working for @entity32 , does have one theory on why the nocturnal animal appears so keen to make friends			0
he said : ' it is probably the same genet as the photos were taken at the same camera trap site			2
' as far as we are aware this is the first recorded behaviour like this but we would love to know if anyone else has recorded something similar			0
' we were so surprised that we caught it again and again on camera at exactly the same place			2
' it was even more surprising that it does so on more than one animal and more than one species			0
' we are not sure what is happening here but after looking at the photos you can see that in some images , the genet is literally going along for a ride , while in a few others the genet is near the head			1
look familiar ? @entity170 is seen hitching a ride on an ostrich here in a slightly more fanciful example of two species bonding together a genet ( stock image shown ) is a mammal that resembles a cross between a cat and a mongoose			1
they have spotted coats , long banded tails , small heads and large ears ' it could be similar behaviour to cattle egrets which go for a ride and wait for the large animal to flush insects			2
in this case the genet could be using this vantage point to spot small prey and so could be picking ticks of the animals ears , ' said dr @entity140 of @entity32 since the amusing images have come to light , the group are now planning to put a remote video camera trap in the same location to see if they can record the behaviour more accurately ' it could be similar behaviour to cattle egrets which go for a ride and wait for the large animal to flush insects			1

genets are related to cats , but more closely related to mongooses			0
they commonly have spotted coats , long , banded tails , small heads and large ears			0
caught in a love triangle ? in later images the genet ( shown in the red circle ) returned , this time deciding to briefly side with the buffalo as the two beasts appeared to size each other up - although the genet was later spotted with the rhino again camera traps are used to monitor wildlife without invading on their privacy			1
they are triggered by movement and use a non-irritating flash studying photographs from camera traps can reveal the movements and behaviour of animals when they are not otherwise observed the experts expect the ganet will be making repeat appearances to the location			0
