an estimated one in five people will suffer with depression in their lifetime			2
but scientists have now found that macaque monkeys show similar signs of depression to humans , such as shying away from a group , losing their appetite and adopting a hunched posture			1
by studying creatures in a social situation , they hope to learn more about why humans may become depressed , which could improve treatment for the debilitating mental disorder			1
scientists have found that macaque monkeys show similar signs of depression to humans , such as shying away from a group ( shown in @entity24 ) and adopting a hunched posture ( shown at a , @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity24 )			1
image c suggests bullying from dominant monkeys ( marked in the pictures with red arrows ) in the form of a cut to the monkey 's ear			1
intimidating behaviour ( b and @entity38 ) may explain the monkeys ' depression previous studies have used rodents , which ' do not realistically resemble the etiopathological [ causal ] development of depression , which occurs naturally in a social context , ’ according to the study , published in @entity48			1
researchers at @entity50 , @entity51 , and @entity52 in @entity53 , examined depression in cynomolgus macaque monkeys living in social colonies at @entity57 in @entity58 , eastern @entity51			1
the cause of depression in some cases , appears to be down to bullying behaviour by dominant members of the colonies , such as intimidating and even attacking lower status monkeys			1
each colony was made up of two males and approximately 20 females as well as their offspring , reflecting how they would live in the wild			0
twenty females showing symptoms of depression , such as no interest in food , grooming or mating			2
dominant behaviour is marked with red arrows , above and depressed monkeys with blue arrows			1
feeding : the depressed monkeys spent less time eating and drinking than their healthy peers			2
behaviour : they spent less time resting on elevated perches such as shelves and hanging chains , which are favourites with healthier and more dominant monkeys			1
movement : depressed subjects spent more time sitting on the floor and less time walking around			0
grooming : the sad monkeys spent less time grooming each other and being groomed , which is a sign of sociability in healthy monkeys			0
they also spent less time taking care of themselves , by scratching , for example			0
nursing : they also nursed their infants less than healthy monkeys			0
a total of 52 colonies were observed and 1,007 female monkeys screened for depression , @entity106 reported			2
twenty females showing symptoms of depression , such as no interest in food , grooming or mating , were chosen and compared to 20 ‘ happy ’ monkeys and 10 that had been kept in isolation and were also thought to be depressed			2
the researchers found that the naturally depressed and isolated monkeys behaved in a similar way , such as ‘ stereotypical prostrated and socially unresponsive posture as well as exacerbation of socially submissive behaviours , ’ the study said			0
naturally depressed monkeys displayed a slumped posture , less interest in feeding and sex and diminished communication and reciprocal grooming with others			0
' one to two subjects per stable social colony ( 17 – 22 subjects ) manifested a depressive phenotype that may be attributed to psychosocial stress , ’ the study said			0
the authors believe that their monkey model of depression mimics real life and is closer to how depression develops than humans ( illustrated with a stock image ) than rodent models as well as behavioural changes , they also identified metabolic differences between depressed and healthy monkeys , which has also been witnessed in humans			1
the healthy monkeys spent longer feeding and drinking compared to their depressed peers who were not as interested in eating , for example			0
the authors believe that their monkey model of depression mimics real life and is closer to how depression develops in humans than rodent models			0
‘ this model 's stable depression phenotype demonstrates superior validity to traditional rodent models of depression by better approximating the psychosocial stressors encountered by adult humans living in a resource - based competitive society and can aid further investigation into the mechanisms underlying depression , ’ they wrote .			0

*experts* from *universities* in @entity51 and @entity53 studied monkeys
identified signs of depression , such as losing appetite and hunching over
*unhappiness* may be caused by bullying behaviour by dominant monkeys
studying *primates* in social situation may shed light on human depression
