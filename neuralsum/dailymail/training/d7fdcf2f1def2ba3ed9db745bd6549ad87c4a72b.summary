by @entity1 reporter published : 17:03 est , 6 march 2014 updated : 06:00 est , 7 march 2014 love your tablet computer , but sometimes wish you just could roll it up like a newspaper and stick it away in your pocket ? soon exactly this will be possible , thanks to a breakthrough in the technology which allows electronic gadgets to be folded up or bent			1
until now , these intricate computer components – thin plastic sheets of electronic circuits , similar to sheets of paper – were only available in very small quantities in laboratories and limited to certain types of devices			0
the new technology of more lightweight and flexible circuitry could mean a much more unique technology , like a flexible tablet computer that can be rolled up or folded but researchers at the @entity29 are working with @entity30 to develop their ‘ source - gated - transistor ’ ( @entity32 ) , a simple circuit which is likely to become much easier to manufacture for ‘ smart ’ gadgets			1
it means flexible tablets could be widely available in the near future , the journal @entity36 said			1
previously studies found that the technology could be applied to lots of different electronic designs , as long as they had an analogue basis , but through the most recent study has found that @entity32 technology can be applied to next - generation digital circuits			0
circuitry has previously been incredibly complicated , not to mention regimented by the technology available , and new technology might mean easier production of next generation tech sgts control the electric current as it enters a semiconductor , which decreases the odds of circuit malfunction , improves energy efficiency and keeps fabrication costs to a minimum			2
these properties make @entity53 ideal for next - gen electronic devices , and could enable digital technologies to be incorporated into those built using flexible plastics or clothing textiles			2
other technologies might include ultra-lightweight and flexible gadgets which can be rolled up to save space when not in use , smart plasters , thinner than a human hair , that can wirelessly monitor the health of the wearer , low - cost electronic shopping tags for instant checkout , and disaster prediction sensors , used on buildings in regions that are at high risk of natural disasters			1
lead researcher doctor @entity83 , of the @entity84 ( @entity85 ) at the @entity29 , said : ' these technologies involve thin plastic sheets of electronic circuits , similar to sheets of paper , but embedded with smart technologies			1
' until now , such technologies could only be produced reliably in small quantities , and that confined them to the research lab. ' however , with @entity53 we have shown we can achieve characteristics needed to make these technologies viable , without increasing the complexity or cost of the design			0
' professor @entity102 , director of the @entity85 and a co-author of the study , said : ' this work is a classic example of academia working closely with industry for over two decades to perfect a concept which has wide - reaching applications across a variety of technologies			0
' @entity53 can be applied to mainstream materials such as silicon , used widely in the production of current consumer devices , it is the potential to apply them to new materials such graphene that makes this research so crucial			0
' ' by making these incredible devices less complex and implicitly very affordable , we could see the next generation of gadgets become mainstream much quicker than we thought			0

new ' @entity128 ' is much easier to produce for smart gadgets
researchers at @entity29 *collaborated* with @entity30 in creation
@entity134 could mean flexible tablets and much smaller technology
these new technologies could be available in the next few years
