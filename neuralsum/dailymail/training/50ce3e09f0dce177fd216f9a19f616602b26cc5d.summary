@entity0 produced their best performance of the season to deny fierce rivals @entity3 a piece of history and put a major dent in their play - off hopes			1
the @entity8 went into the contest on a wet night at the @entity10 chasing a hat - trick of wins over the @entity0 for the first time in the @entity15 era , but left smarting from a 28 - 0 defeat which leaves their top - eight aspirations hanging by a thread			1
the @entity0 dominated a full - blooded first half and barely allowed rovers into their 40 , although they only had tries from @entity23 and @entity24 and two @entity26 goals to show for their efforts			1
three and no so easy : @entity0 prevented their local rivals from completing an historic @entity15 hat - trick @entity30 settled any nerves @entity0 had on 45 minutes and the result was beyond doubt when @entity33 crashed over , with @entity30 completing a resounding win with an interception try			1
it was a typically frenetic start to the derby with ferocious tackling and over-exuberance resulting in numerous early errors			0
the hosts drew first blood on 10 minutes after a penalty gave them good field position , @entity45 and @entity46 combining to put @entity47 over in the corner			0
backed by a vociferous home crowd , the @entity0 were celebrating again in the 19th minute and the try owed much to @entity26 's composure			2
he controlled a poor pass by @entity54 with his instep before feeding @entity24 and standing back to watch the big centre power his way across the line			2
@entity26 landed his first kick of the night to give @entity0 a 10 - 0 lead , one they were full value for amid a passionate and controlled first - half performance led by captain @entity63			1
rovers failed to launch a meaningful attack and lacked discipline in the opening 40 minutes , with another penalty allowing @entity26 to kick a two - pointer from 35 metres out on the stroke of the break			0
the @entity8 began the second period on the front foot and forced the first drop out of the night after @entity74 was forced to put @entity76 's kick dead			0
unfortunately for the visitors and their strong travelling contingent behind the posts , @entity80 , playing in his last @entity0 derby before leaving to play in the @entity82 , lost control of the ball trying to force a pass			1
another error by @entity87 in his own 10 metres gifted the @entity0 possession and they made him pay as @entity90 took a pass by his ankles , laid the ball on to @entity94 who fed @entity96 to dive over for a simple score			0
@entity46 was at the heart of a melee in the aftermath of the try and that only served to fire @entity0 up even more			0
they scored again through @entity33 on the hour mark after he capitalised on a half break by @entity90			2
@entity26 added the extras to make it 22 - 0 and it appeared as if that would be how it finished as both sides struggled to keep hold of the ball in increasingly greasy conditions			1
but @entity30 plucked a @entity76 pass out of the sky and raced 90 metres to round off the scoring six minutes from time			0
