@entity3 veterinarian @entity1 's claims that she proved the existence of @entity5 with dna evidence last fall caused even some serious scientists to stand up and take notice			1
now , they 're rolling over and playing dead			0
a @entity11 newspaper reporter had the purposed @entity5 sample dna tested by an independent geneticist and found @entity15 's ' evidence ' is n't what she claims			1
the sample contains mostly opossum dna , mixed in with markers from other animals , according to the tests			1
@entity22 science reporter @entity21 says there is no evidence that any of the dna in the sample belongs to a @entity5 or any other hominid cousins of humans			1
coming up empty : the much - vaunted ' proof ' that that @entity5 exists turned out to be false after an independent geneticist found no hominid dna in a crumb sample @entity22 science reporter @entity21 says a reputed sample of @entity5 sample contains mostly opossum dna - along with traces from other animals when @entity39 released her ' scientific study ' of @entity5 earlier this year , @entity38 hammered her for not submitting the paper to a credible peer - reviewed journal and not allowing mainstream researchers to verify her work			1
instead , she launched a journal of her own , the @entity46 , and published her findings online and charged $ 30 to read the work			0
' if @entity39 really had the goods she would have co-authored the paper with reputable scientists and gotten the work published in a reputable scientific journal , ' @entity38 wrote in february			2
' instead she ’s playing to an audience that does n’t understand how science works , that wants to believe @entity5 exists and is willing to send her some cash to further their delusions			0
' however , @entity39 approached @entity38 and offered him definitive proof of her findings - she would let his friend , a top @entity11 geneticist , take a sample of her @entity66 and test it himself			1
@entity39 claims the sample came from a family of ten @entity69 that lives in northern @entity70			2
she says the sample was taken from the crumbs left behind after the @entity73 ate blueberry bagels			0
face - off : science reporter @entity21 had the reputed @entity76 tested by a top geneticist			1
he found @entity39 's claim of finding the @entity5 false she claims that her analysis of the @entity5 's @entity66 shows that they are distant cousins to human beings - the result of a non-human hominid mating with human women about 15,000 years ago			2
@entity38 admits he allowed himself to get momentarily excited by the prospect of testing @entity87			2
' if the evidence backed up @entity39 ’s claims , i had a blockbuster story			0
my geneticist source would have a hand in making the scientific discovery of the decade , or perhaps the century			0
@entity39 would be vindicated , ' he wrote			0
instead , he says , rational science came crashing down			0
the sample contained nothing more than the remnants left behind by common forest animals .			1

@entity22 reporter @entity21 had the reputed @entity87 tested by a top geneticist
@entity39 had claimed that she used dna tests to prove the existence of the *mythical* creatures
the sample actually contains opossum dna , along with traces from other forest animals
