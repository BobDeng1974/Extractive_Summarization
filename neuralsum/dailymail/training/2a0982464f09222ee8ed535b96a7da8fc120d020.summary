a @entity1 university lecturer has caused an outcry after footage emerged showing him calling homosexuality an ' inexplicable aberration ' and saying gay people are ' so ignorant you do n't even understand what your bodies are for '			2
in a video that has gone viral , @entity11 , 52 , a theology lecturer and director of studies at @entity13 , called homosexuality the ' ultimate inversion ' , and said homosexual acts were an ' extreme defiance of @entity19 '			1
today the public school - educated academic , a practising @entity20 who also uses the name @entity23 , apologised for his remarks that were made ' at least 15 years ago ' before he joined the university , and said his views had changed since			1
@entity44 , president of the @entity45 + group for lesbian , gay and transgender students , said : ' remarks degrading @entity51 + people , relationships or sexual practices surely disgust any of us who are part of the decades - long struggle to see @entity45 + people as valued , equal citizens ... ' we know that mr @entity11 has asked for the video to be taken down ; it remains for his college to decide whether these past remarks are incompatible with his current role in the college , especially if it has a pastoral nature , and we are currently in communication with them over this			1
' @entity70 , 23 , a finalist studying @entity71 at @entity72 , said the ' hateful , anachronistic views ' expressed in the video made him feel ' deeply uncomfortable '			2
he added : ' i think he should be removed from his position as director of studies because his views could cloud his judgement when dealing with gay students and could even put gay people off from applying for his subject for fear of prejudice			2
' if the views are out of context then he should explain that context			2
' @entity11 is a director of studies at @entity13 , @entity1 , where he meets students regularly to check how they are the divinity lecturer compared gay people to arsonists , saying just because you are born with a tendency does n't mean it should be legalised in the eight - minute rant which is believed to be taken from his dvd , @entity96 on disciplining @entity97 , he referred to gay people , saying : ' you 're an ignorant people			1
why ignorant ? because you do n't even understand what your bodies are for			0
' how ignorant can you get ? even the animals know			0
' video : watch the @entity1 lecturer 's no - holds - barred rant at homosexuality mr @entity11 , who is rated number 50 on the muslim 500 list of the most influential @entity108 in the world , discussed at length the @entity116 's ( @entity20 law 's ) ' emphatic , unqualified condemnation and prohibition of all forms of homosexual behaviour '			1
in the video , which was made when he was in his 30s , mr @entity11 compared gay people to arsonists , arguing that arsonists have a genetic predisposition to be arsonists , but just because they are born with it does not mean arson should be made legal			1
' that 's no argument for legalising what they do , ' he said			0
' the claim that a human being is born with a particular tendency means that it should be legalised is neither here nor there			0
' no holds barred : the chairman of @entity1 's lgbt + society said he was ' disgusted ' by mr @entity11 's remarks he went on to compare gay people to smokers , affirming that practising homosexuality is more dangerous than smoking			1
' there is a great war against cigarette smoking but there is no campaign at all against the vice of the people of @entity144 [ ie people of @entity145 , or homosexuals ] ' , he said			0
the lecturer also says that in the eyes of @entity150 , homosexuality was not a sin , but practising it was			0
' even in the case of those few individuals that do appear to have an incurable tendency towards this inexplicable aberration , if they do not act upon the tendency they are not sinning ... ' acting upon and gratifying the tendency is the sin			0
' today mr @entity11 , who has apologised to the @entity1 and to the @entity162 , where he teaches , told @entity163 : ' the @entity165 clip is at least 15 years old , and does not in any way represent my present views			1
' i am happy to confirm that i certainly do not see homosexuals as an " inexplicable aberration "			0
the other views expressed in it should not be taken as indicators of what i currently believe - we all have our youthful enthusiasms , and we all move on			2
' he told @entity178 the interview was recorded in @entity43 after a talk he had given there in the 1990s			0
a @entity1 spokesman said : ' mr @entity11 has apologised for these remarks , recorded nearly twenty years ago , and has emphasised that he no longer holds these views			1
' the clip was taken down from @entity165 last night at mr @entity11 's request , but not before it had gone viral			1
it is still available to buy on dvd on @entity150 on demand and @entity191 .			0
