' within seconds my chest had tightened up - i could hardly breathe and the arteries on either side of my neck were sticking out as thick as pencils , ' he says			0
' i could see my clothes moving with the power of my heartbeat			0
the pain was agonising , and i was terrified i was about to have a heart attack			2
' somehow , he got through the song , then crawled backstage , where an ambulance was called			0
' it took half an hour because when the control centre heard my age , they downgraded it from an emergency , ' he says			0
however , a monitor revealed his heart rate was 250 beats per minute			2
a normal rate for a healthy young man is 65 - 80			2
' i 'd been suffering from minor episodes of heart pounding from my earlier 20s , and i 'd seen my gp several times who told me not to worry about it , ' says @entity1			1
' previously my heart rate always returned to normal after a couple of hours , and i was sure it would this time			2
luckily , the paramedics did n't listen to me			0
' in hospital , doctors administered morphine for the vice-like chest pain , while trying unsuccessfully to bring down @entity1 's heart rate with drugs			1
after 45 minutes , he was still struggling for breath , and doctors feared he was about to have a potentially fatal heart attack			2
they told him he needed emergency treatment under general anaesthetic - electric shocks would be used to stop then start his heart again , in the hope this would ' reset ' it			2
' i knew from their faces that they might not be able to start my heart again , ' recalls @entity1			1
the procedure worked , and the next morning he was told he was suffering from @entity64 , which affects the electrical circuitry controlling heartbeats			2
@entity1 , from @entity67 , had been born with extra electrical pathways in the heart			1
occasionally , electrical signals travelled down them , causing his heart to contract much faster			1
every year , 600 young people die from conditions affecting the heart 's electrical activity			1
it 's not known how many people are living with these problems , as most , like @entity1 , are only diagnosed when they become life - threatening			1
his symptoms got suddenly worse after he 'd been performing in @entity80 with his twin brother @entity81 and their sister @entity82 , 26 , as the rock band @entity1			1
@entity1 , from @entity67 , had been born with extra electrical pathways in the heart late nights and partying could have triggered his collapse , as people with extra , or distorted , electrical pathways are sensitive to the stimulation of adrenaline , explains @entity92 , professor of inherited cardiac disease and sports cardiology at @entity96 's @entity95 , @entity97			1
' if their lifestyle includes a lot of alcohol , caffeine , lengthy exertion or lack of sleep , it can increase their adrenaline levels and that can exacerbate the symptoms of their condition , in extreme cases to a fatal level			2
' problems with the heart 's electrical circuits are also thought to have a genetic link			1
@entity1 's father has had atrial fibrillation , a faulty heart rhythm , for most of his life , while his grandfather died of a heart attack at 73			1
after @entity1 was rushed to hospital in @entity126 in june 2009 , his brother was found to be suffering from a very mild form of tachycardia - rapid heartbeat - which did n't need treatment ; his sister has not been affected			1
@entity1 was put on flecainide acetate , a drug to control his heart rate , but suffered bad side - effects			1
his cardiologist then suggested cardiac ablation , where the extra electrical circuitry is burnt away , stopping the faulty messages being sent			2
this treatment is safe and has an extremely high success rate of up to 95 per cent , says professor @entity92			0
he had the operation in early 2010 but two months later was rushed to hospital with a heart rate of 250			2
doctors had to use electric shocks again to ' reset ' @entity148 second ablation was out of the question , as patients have to wait at least three months between them to allow for healing and gauge exactly how successful the first has been			0
so @entity1 was sent home and told to rest			1
' @entity1 was on the verge of breaking into the big time , and i was being told to take it easy , ' he says			1
' i also felt bad for my siblings			0
to contain our frustration , we decided to help raise awareness of heart conditions			1
once a week , the family went into shopping centres to play free gigs , hand out leaflets , raise money and talk to people			0
' i told them i had n't pushed my gp for a referral to a cardiologist because i thought a heart condition was something that happened to old men , ' says @entity1			1
' but up to eight young people a week die from conditions such as mine			1
' the campaign had a dramatic result			0
' a woman told us her five - year - old boy had described a " noisy helicopter in his chest "			0
i told her to take him to his gp and insist on a referral			0
' we later heard he 'd been diagnosed with tachycardia			0
he has now been successfully treated			0
' in december 2010 , @entity1 had a second ablation			1
it did n't work , and he also developed atrial fibrillation , which affects electrical activity in a different part of the heart			1
in other words , he had two electrical disorders			0
he was put on beta - blockers until he could have a third operation , which cured the atrial fibrillation but not the @entity201			0
finally , in december 2011 , a fourth operation destroyed the remaining rogue electrical pathways			0
' i 'm still checked regularly , but do n't have to take medication , ' says @entity1			2
' we 're back gigging and in talks with a major record company			0
' last year , the band released an album called @entity211 - the medical term for a faulty heartbeat			0
' we want to continue raising awareness of the condition that nearly killed me , ' says @entity1			1
for more information on abnormal heart rhythms			0
see c - r - y.org.uk			0
the band 's website is at miccoli.co.uk .			0

every year , 600 young people die from electrical heart conditions
@entity1 , 28 , from @entity67 , was born with such a condition
