by @entity0 published : 09:46 est , 5 february 2013 updated : 10:11 est , 5 february 2013 when , eighty - five years ago , 21 - year - old @entity2 declared her intention to swim the treacherous @entity4 between @entity5 and @entity6 , the world thought she was mad			1
the distance is 11 miles as the crow flies - but more often calculated as 22 - and - a - half once the water 's brutal currents are taken into account			1
the stretch of water which links @entity14 to @entity15 had a fearsome reputation due to its lethal tides , caused by scattered headlands and islands funnelling enormous volumes of tidal water through small spaces			0
many men had attempted the challenge and failed			0
@entity2 , the first person to swim the @entity4 , with her swimming trophy and then , just two years later , in 1929 , a 16 - year - old schoolgirl named @entity27 declared she would emulate @entity2 and try her hand at the same perilous swim			1
remarkably , both of these women succeeded in their challenge , and @entity2 became the first swimmer to ever complete the task , remaining in the @entity35 of records until the 1990s			1
now a fellow wild - swimmer , @entity37 , has paid tribute to these two extraordinary athletes who were dismissed by locals at the time as ' mere women ' who would never have the strength or stamina to go the distance			2
@entity45 has written a book , @entity47 , published by @entity48 , to tell the oft - forgotten story of these pioneering ' lady swimmers ' of the 1920s , who defied convention - in an age when the expectation for women was simply marriage and motherhood - with ambition			0
a photo from 1929 shows @entity27 , then 16 , being pulled out of the water aftr her swim by a friend recounting the day when @entity2 completed the challenge , ms @entity37 said : ' at 4.15am on september 5 , 1927 , @entity2 stood on the beach at @entity14 , a small seaside town just outside @entity65 , in a black @entity67 bathing costume and submarine cap , intent on swimming from @entity70 to @entity71			1
' the @entity72 were campaigning for women ’s rights , but nobody thought a girl could cross to the other side - many men had tried and failed			0
' critics said a ' mere woman ' should never attempt such a feat. in fact , following their story announcing @entity2 ’s intention , the local newspaper had been obliged to print the following clarification because no one believed the original article : ' miss @entity2 , the @entity14 lady swimmer , whose decision to attempt the @entity4 was exclusively reported in yesterday ’s @entity89 , reaffirmed in an interview today that our report was correct in its entirety			2
' @entity2 recovering after her swim across the @entity95 - she was , on 5 september 1927 - the first person ever to complete the swim ms @entity37 continued : ' crowds lined the beach to watch @entity2 wade into the chill grey waters , accompanied by a launch containing representatives from the @entity103 and a rowing boat carrying her uncle @entity105 in a bowler hat			1
' seven hours and 20 minutes later she reached the shores of @entity71 ; fortified by beef tea and chocolate , @entity107 received a rapturous welcome from the @entity112			0
she was the first person , as well as the first woman , to swim the @entity4			2
' compelling images from newspapers of the time show her exhausted , slumped in a boat , before she was taken to a hotel where she had a warm and cold bath , a half - hour rest in bed , and a good fish lunch before returning to @entity5 a celebrity			0
' @entity124 is helped into a boat following her exhausting 7hr 20min swim @entity2 's triumph being celebrated by local dignitaries in @entity129 two years later a plucky teenager named @entity27 took 10 hours , 17 minutes and 10 seconds to make the crossing , becoming the second person to successfully swim the channel			1
when she arrived at the finish line in @entity14 a police constable escorted her through cheering crowds to the tune of ' @entity138 '			0
ms @entity37 continued : ' at a reception in the @entity142 , the council 's chairman told the audience they were especially proud of @entity144 who had displayed " amazing pluck in enduring for over ten hours one of the biggest trials that could be demanded of any athlete , man or woman "			0
' @entity2 , holidng the bouquet , being honoured in the town of @entity14 after completing the challenge a portrait of @entity2 , the first person to swim the @entity4 , left , and the cover of @entity37 ' book though locals at the time campaigned for monuments of remembrance after the women had completed their challenges , it was not until 2007 was @entity2 's achievement was marked by a plaque on @entity14 seafront			1
after @entity2 's triumph , a letter from a person named @entity170 was printed in the local newspaper , suggesting the town needed ' something to commemorate this great achievement that generations yet to come may know about it '			1
@entity170 named @entity2 ' a splendid descendant of the old @entity180 pluck , daring and the unquenchable spirit which enabled our ancestors to do such deeds which made our nation the greatest the world had ever seen			2
' @entity27 went on to marry @entity187 , later @entity188 , the @entity189 journalist and editor famous for his work on the @entity192 , but in 1935 she died giving birth			0
the @entity47 by @entity37 ( @entity48 , £ 14.99 ) is published on 14 february			0

in 1927 @entity2 , 21 , was first person to swim the 11 - mile distance
actual swim is said to be 22.5 miles when factoring in strong currents
the crossing took @entity2 7hrs 20mins
@entity27 , 16 , became the second person to do it two years later
the crossing took her 10hrs *17mins*
the channel was famously perilous because of the strong currents
no man had ever succeeded before them
