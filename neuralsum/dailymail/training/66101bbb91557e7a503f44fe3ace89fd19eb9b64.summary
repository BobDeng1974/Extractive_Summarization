by @entity0 published : 07:48 est , 19 december 2012 updated : 03:06 est , 20 december 2012 police officers visiting a school to talk to children about ' respecting your peers ' broke up a playground fight between two pupils using pepper spray			1
the two officers were lecturing youngsters when a scuffle broke out at lunchtime between two 15 - year - old boys			1
one officer then sprayed the painful anti-riot device in the boys ' faces - even though no punches were thrown			1
a fight broke out between two teenage boys at @entity21 , pictured , and police responded by using pepper spray police today defended claims the tactic was too heavy - handed saying it was the most appropriate means to break up the fight between the two 15 - year - old boys			1
they said the pepper spray was used because physically separating the boys could have ' dislocated their shoulders or broken their arms '			2
the incident happened at @entity21 , in @entity34 , @entity35 on december 3			1
sgt @entity36 , from @entity35 police said : ' the school invited us in for a week to talk to the students about their role in the school among their peers and in the wider community			1
' it also gave us a good chance to try and break down some of the barriers			2
' while we were in the school on the monday a scuffle broke out			0
police today defended claims the tactic was too heavy - handed saying it was the most appropriate means to break up the fight at the school pepper spray is an aerosol spray containing oils obtained from cayenne pepper			1
it is irritating to the eyes and respiratory passages and used as a disabling device			1
it is generally used by spraying it directly into an individual â€™s eyes , forcing them to close them			0
the spray gives a burning sensation which will last approximately 30 minutes			0
the idea behind the use of a pepper spray is that the receiver suffers from reduced vision and is therefore less likely to approach police in a threatening way			1
it was introduced into the @entity78 in 2001 for use by police forces			2
but it is illegal for citizens to both bring pepper spray into the @entity78 and to possess it			0
individuals who are caught carrying or using pepper spray can be arrested			0
there are many criticisms of the use of pepper spray ranging from the fact that it does not work on all individuals to the suggestion it could cause more damage to the eyes than first thought			0
' the two students involved were being kept apart , but it was clear they were not calming down			0
' teachers only have the same powers as the general public have in these circumstance and there was a worry the children or others might be injured , so we deployed parva [ pepper ] spray			0
' a spokesperson for @entity110 added : ' it was deemed the most appropriate means to split up the two boys			0
' physically pulling away 15 - year - old 's in they situation could cause injuries to the children - such as dislocated shoulders and broken arms			0
' the effects of the spray wear off quickly and there is no lasting damage			0
' however , parents of children at the academy school , which caters for pupils aged 3 - 19 , yesterday gave a mixed reaction to the police officers ' actions			1
a mother - of - two , who did not wish to be named , said : ' i thought pepper spray was only used in extreme circumstances - not on young teenagers			2
' it was a heavy - handed tactic and a bit over the top i believe			2
' another parent added : ' it 'll teach them a good lesson			0
they wo n't do it again in a hurry will they ? ' headteacher @entity148 said : ' it 's not a situation we 'd normally call the police in , but given they were here it seemed sensible			2
' the good thing was that in the end no one was injured and no punches where thrown			1
