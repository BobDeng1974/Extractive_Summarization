@entity2 molluscs and killer shrimps have colonised @entity5 ’s rivers so extensively that some already look like the @entity6 , academics have said			1
a @entity8 study has found that invasive species from @entity10 and @entity11 are overwhelming native @entity12 species			1
travelling to our shores on ship hulls or clinging to ornamental plants imported for our gardens , the animals are creating eco-systems that will support other foreign animals			1
' @entity22 peril ' : the killer shrimp , pictured , is among the invasive species that are colonising @entity5 's rivers			1
the animals kill and feed on native @entity12 shrimps five of the most invasive freshwater creatures from the @entity29 , @entity6 and @entity30 are now in @entity5 - including the quagga mussel , found just two weeks ago in the @entity32 near @entity33			1
researchers say that , with at least ten more of these high - risk species established just across the channel in @entity38 ports , @entity5 could be on the brink of what they describe as an ‘ invasional meltdown ’			2
they have called for greater monitoring on areas at most risk - the lower reaches of the @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 and the @entity49			0
their dire warning , published on monday in the @entity52 , says the issue is vital for ‘ national biosecurity ’			0
greatest threat : the invader scientists are most concerned about are the quagga mussel , pictured , which alarmingly was first discovered in the @entity5 just two weeks ago study author dr @entity58 said : ‘ in some parts of @entity5 the freshwater community already looks more like the @entity6			2
‘ the @entity49 , for example , typically viewed as a wildlife haven , is actually dominated by @entity64 - @entity6 zebra mussels and killer shrimps in many places			2
‘ pretty much everything in our rivers and lakes is directly or indirectly vulnerable			0
tiny killer : the quagga mussels , discovered in a reservoir near @entity33 , will smother and kill native mussels , affect water quality and block pipes ‘ the invader we are most concerned about is the quagga mussel , which alarmingly was first discovered in the @entity5 just two weeks ago			1
this pest will smother and kill our native mussels , block water pipes and foul boat hulls			0
’ other invasive species include the demon shrimp , bloody red shrimp and the killer shrimp - dubbed the ‘ pink peril ’			1
each of these species kill and feed on native @entity12 shrimps			0
but more alarmingly , the foreign invaders act as a gateway for further invasive species , because they kill the competition and in some cases create an eco-system which is favourable for other invaders to thrive			2
the zebra mussel , for example , provides an ideal home for invasive shrimps which have striped patterns to blend in with the mussels ’ shells			0
the shrimps , in turn , provide food for larger invaders such as goby fish			0
gobies have now made their way down the @entity113 , one of the main corridors to @entity5 , with populations exploding in the waterways of western @entity118 over the last few years			0
the invading gobies eat native invertebrate and displace native fish such as the already threatened @entity122			0
dr @entity58 said : ‘ if we look at @entity38 nowadays it is sometimes hard to find a @entity127 - @entity6 species in their waterways			0
’ @entity129 , deputy director of fisheries and biodiversity at the @entity132 , said : ‘ invasive species – such as the quagga mussel – cost the @entity5 economy in excess of £ 1.8 billion every year			1
‘ the quagga mussel is a highly invasive non-native species , affecting water quality and clogging up pipes			1

invasive species from @entity10 and @entity11 are colonising @entity5 's rivers
animals are creating eco-systems that will support other foreign animals
fast - breeding quagga mussels affect water quality and clog up pipes
other threats include the killer shrimp - dubbed the ‘ pink peril ’
