by @entity1 reporter published : 10:16 est , 13 june 2013 updated : 10:16 est , 13 june 2013 four have - a - go - hero @entity3 sailing a converted warship to @entity5 on what they describe as an ' anti-piracy ' mission have been arrested off @entity10			1
armed marine commandos boarded their decommissioned fast attack gun ship defender , which has two fearsome - looking cannons , and took them into custody in @entity15			1
the @entity10 authorities said the four - all @entity18 servicemen - were detained on suspicion of ' illegal activity '			1
farcical : the gunboat defender , pictured impounded in @entity23 , was being crewed by four @entity25 ex-servicemen on an ' anti-piracy ' mission , it has now been seized by @entity10 authorities the group , led by former @entity31 submariner @entity30 , had already had the 127ft defender impounded in the @entity33			1
the @entity34 were suspicious that the vessel was registered as a pleasure craft and confiscated their @entity25 flag and ordered them to remain in port in @entity23			1
but after five weeks on the island the crew gave the authorities the slip - only to be impounded a second time five days later			1
the group are reported to be heading to the pirate - infested @entity46 where they planned to offer security to oil rigs			0
they insist they are ' not mercenaries ' and their boat has no working weapons or ammunition			0
they left @entity57 on april 16 and before departing mr @entity30 , from @entity58 , said they were going on an anti-piracy mission			2
he said they were heading to @entity10 ' to discuss with the authorities the possible use of the defender as a deterrent against illegal fishing boats			1
' defender , which is no longer on the @entity69 , was built in @entity70 in the mid- 1970s for the sultan of @entity73 's navy in the @entity46 and decommissioned in 2002 the crew , which also includes @entity75 from @entity76 , @entity57 , first ran into trouble off @entity23 on april 23 when their ship blew a gasket			1
they were forced to stop in the resort of @entity82 where they were boarded by @entity85 officers who refused them permission to stay there			0
the vessel was then escorted 50 miles to a berth in the island 's @entity91 port by a @entity34 navy warship			1
officials are understood to have been suspicious that the formidable looking vessel , which flies the @entity25 flag , was registered as a pleasure boat			0
the @entity34 ministry of defence said an inspection revealed ' irregularities in the paperwork of the boat and its crew , as well as deficiencies in safety equipment '			2
mr @entity30 , 53 , who bought the boat in 2011 , was fined 40,000 euros because its waste systems did not meet standards set for pleasure vessels			2
the ship 's @entity25 pendant was removed and it was placed under the custody of armed @entity114			0
one report in @entity34 said the defender was actually en route for @entity118			2
mr @entity30 accused the @entity34 authorities of making a ' fuss about nothing ' and said the cannons on his boat were ' just for show and totally unusable '			1
but in the early hours of may 31 , while the guards were called away , the defender set off with the fine allegedly outstanding and five days later it was intercepted off @entity10			1
colonel @entity128 , spokesman for the @entity129 , said the ship was being held in @entity15 and four @entity25 former members of the armed forces had been arrested			0
sources identified mr @entity30 and mr @entity75 as two of the arrested men			2
mission : defender was on her way to the @entity139 to help tackle the problem of piracy off the @entity5 coast ( file picture ) a second @entity129 spokesman said the ship had been detained over suspected ' illegal activity ' but refused to disclose further details			0
the @entity148 said : ' we are aware of the arrest of four @entity151 in @entity10			0
we stand ready to provide consular assistance			0
' the 135 tons defender , which is no longer on the @entity69 , was built in @entity70 in the mid- 1970s for the sultan of @entity73 's navy in the @entity46 and decommissioned in 2002			1
after buying the ship in 2011 mr @entity30 told the @entity159 newspaper : ' defender 's task will be to deter any pirates intent on boarding the many ships that pass the @entity5 coastline			2
' one look at her should be enough to send them looking for easier targets			0
' she will be manned by handpicked @entity170 and run as a professional naval ship , obeying the rules of engagement			0
' our primary task will be to protect oil platforms which are towed close to the coast of @entity5 , and a number of oil companies want to hire defender to look after their interests			0
' we are not mercenaries ; this is strictly a business venture similar to other @entity25 private protection firms which operate in @entity185 and @entity186 .			0

defender is a 127 ft former @entity73 navy fast attack @entity189
crew of four is led by former @entity31 submariner @entity30
it had already been impounded by @entity34 authorities in @entity23
but just five days after giving them the slip it was seized off @entity10
