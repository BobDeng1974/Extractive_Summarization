@entity0 - is it that time already ? 2015 has finally come around , and for movie buffs everywhere , there is but one pressing question - how many predictions did @entity5 get right about this year ? in the 1989 sci - fi comedy classic , @entity7 travel through time to the futuristic year of 2015			1
the technology , while not quite ready for retail , uses magnetic fields to let users literally ride on air and remarkably , there were incidences where the film 's futuristic predictions were eerily accurate			2
in the movie , @entity7 of 2015 speaks to his colleagues on a video call - a fairly spot - on representation of how we chat using @entity39 or @entity40			1
the characters also answered calls with glasses - similar to how computerized eye - wear @entity46 glass works			0
the film also sees a dehydrated pizza growing into a meal - sized dish after 12 seconds on the ' hydrator plate ' - this could be seen as an early form of the microwave meal			0
self - lacing shoes exist : a @entity57 @entity56 campaign created @entity58 , the athletic shoes that automatically tighten to the wearer 's foot			0
and @entity62 in 2011 created mock - ups of the cinematic shoes to be auctioned for charity			0
for 2015 , the company has said it intends to create a version that actually lace themselves 3d movies ( such as the film 's prediction of a @entity72 19 ) have now become a reality along with holograms			0
hits wearable technology 3d films video - call communication microwave - style meals misses @entity82 flying cars self - tying shoe laces time travel dominance of fax machines while the movie was spot on with many of its predictions , not quite everything from @entity5 has come to pass			1
flying cars have not hit the mainstream in the new millennium			1
great strides have been made by company @entity99 and a @entity102 firm also unveiled a prototype several months ago , the @entity97 , which they believe could travel more than 430 miles in one trip			0
but it will be a long time before flying cars are commonplace			1
and hoverboards are not yet clogging up the skies - although @entity19 are hoping to bring them to the masses with support from skateboarding legend @entity24			2
so far , no one has mastered the art of time travel quite like @entity13 and his flying delorean time machine either			0
@entity5 creators were remarkably accurate when they showed @entity7 of 2015 video - calling with a colleague - much like @entity39 or @entity40 a family speak to each other via @entity39 - similar to the method of communication used in the film nor are there automatically - drying clothes - although there is a range of clothing materials now being used which speed up the evaporation process			1
the film also sees @entity7 donning a pair of self - lacing sneakers			1
while these have n't made it to the common market just yet , there are hints the time - saving footwear could really be on the horizon			2
eerily accurate : in one scene round the dinner table , the characters answer phone calls with glasses , similar to how @entity144 works spot on : 3d movies ( such as the film 's prediction of a @entity72 19 ) have also become a reality along with holograms in 2011 , @entity62 created mock - ups of the cinematic shoes to be auctioned for charity			2
for 2015 , the company has said it intends to create a version that actually lace themselves			0
a @entity57 @entity56 campaign also created @entity58 , the athletic shoes that automatically tighten to the wearer 's foot			0
the film placed far too much emphasis on fax machines , which it imagined would be dominant in 2015 - but with the prevalence of the email , the devices have taken a back seat			2
the movie also failed to predict the invention of smartphones and tablets - arguably the most important technological breakthrough of the millennium			0
the official date that @entity7 and @entity13 landed in the future was october 21 , 2015 - and for super-fans , a specially - created clock will let them countdown the minutes until the big day			1
the official date that @entity7 and @entity13 landed in the future was october 21 , 2015 - and for super-fans , a specially - created clock will let them countdown the minutes until the big day no flying cars but 1989 's @entity5 was n't 100 per cent off the mark about how the year 2015 would look flying cars have not hit the mainstream in the new millennium but various prototypes have been developed hoverboards are not yet clogging up the skies - but @entity19 are hoping to bring them to the masses with support from skateboarding legend @entity24 not quite right : in @entity5 , fax machines are a popular method of communication in 2015 ( scene from the film above )			1

the 1989 sci - fi comedy , *starring* @entity8 and @entity12 got some things spot on in its futuristic *vision* of 2015
flying cars and hoverboards have not made it to mass market - but @entity7 video - calling a colleague looks a lot like @entity39 or @entity40
