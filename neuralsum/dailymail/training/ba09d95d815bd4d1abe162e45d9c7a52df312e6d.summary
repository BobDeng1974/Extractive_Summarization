by @entity0 published : 04:46 est , 24 may 2013 updated : 19:48 est , 24 may 2013 speaker 's wife @entity1 is facing a six - figure payout for libelling a @entity5 peer on @entity6			1
she has lost a @entity8 battle with @entity9 over a tweet suggesting he was a child sex offender			1
mrs @entity1 now faces a crippling payout and legal costs totalling more than £ 100,000 after the court decided the message was libellous			2
the tweet – sent to her 56,000 online followers on november 4 last year – said : ‘ why is @entity9 trending ? * innocent face * ’ libellous : @entity1 's tweet about @entity9 during the child abuse storm was libellous , the @entity8 ruled today she wrote it just two days after the @entity25 ’s @entity24 programme wrongly implicated the former @entity5 treasurer in allegations of abuse at a @entity31 children ’s home in the 1970s and 1980s			1
although the programme did not name @entity9 , it led to widespread internet rumours that he was connected to the abuse			1
the peer has already agreed a £ 185,000 settlement with the @entity25 as well as £ 125,000 with @entity38 after @entity39 revealed his name through an on - screen blunder			0
in february , he announced he was dropping defamation claims against @entity6 users with fewer than 500 followers , saying he wished to ‘ draw this unfortunate episode forced into my life to a close ’			0
mrs @entity1 , 43 , has always insisted her tweet was not defamatory			1
during the hearing last month her lawyer , @entity49 , said : ‘ it ’s the sort of random thought , if one was sitting in one ’s room with one ’s family , you might just come out with but instead of speaking it , tweet it			0
’ but @entity9 ’s lawyers said the tweet ‘ pointed the finger of blame ’ at him , suggesting he was a sex offender			1
suffering : lawyers for @entity5 peer @entity9 said he had suffered ' unnecessary pain ' as a result of the court case while mrs @entity1 said the litigation had been a ' nightmare ' couple : commons speaker @entity70 is understood to have disapproved of his wife taking part in reality tv shows yesterday , mr @entity75 agreed with the peer and said the message provided her online followers with ‘ the last piece of the jigsaw ’ in identifying @entity9 as the subject of the @entity24 documentary			1
he said : ‘ in my judgment , the reasonable reader would understand the words “ innocent face ” as being insincere and ironical			1
there is no sensible reason for including those words in the tweet if they are to be taken as meaning that the defendant simply wants to know the answer to a factual question			0
’ he added : ‘ it is an allegation of guilt			0
i see no room on these facts for any less serious meaning			0
’ last month , mrs @entity1 was directed to pay @entity9 ’s estimated £ 17,000 legal costs incurred during a preliminary hearing			1
she previously declined three offers to settle the case , but has now agreed to settle the dispute for an undisclosed sum			0
her total legal bill , which will include his costs , will reach an estimated £ 100,000 , insiders said yesterday			0
publicity : mrs @entity1 has regularly courted controversy including posing in the window of speaker 's @entity114 fame : in 2011 , mrs @entity1 defied opposition from her husband to take part in celebrity big brother alongside celebrity photographer @entity121 in a statement after the ruling , mrs @entity1 said : ‘ today the @entity8 found that my tweet constituted a serious libel , both in its natural meaning and as an innuendo			2
‘ to say i ’m surprised and disappointed by this is an understatement			0
however , i will accept the ruling as the end of the matter			0
‘ i remain sorry for the distress i have caused @entity9 and i repeat my apologies			2
i have accepted an earlier offer his lawyers made to settle this matter			0
’ @entity9 ’s solicitor , @entity138 , said the peer was ‘ pleased ’ with the result			2
he added : ‘ the apologies previously received from mrs @entity1 did not concede that her tweet was defamatory			2
clearly she must now accept this fact			0
‘ the failure of mrs @entity1 to admit that her tweet was defamatory caused considerable unnecessary pain and suffering to @entity9 and his family over the past six months			1
‘ with knowledge of the judgment , i am pleased to be able to say that mrs @entity1 has finally seen sense and has accepted an offer of settlement , which @entity9 made back in january			1
