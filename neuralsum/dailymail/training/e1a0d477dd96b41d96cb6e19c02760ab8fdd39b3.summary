the school 's interim vice president was also fired on friday as the two men were involved in a decision to ' rehabilitate ' rather than fire coach @entity14 whose abusive behavior was captured on a video			1
university president @entity18 's job appeared to be safe after getting a public nod of support from the school 's board of governors			0
' when he first saw the video of coach @entity14 pushing , shoving and throwing balls at players in november , @entity0 said he wanted to fire him on the spot			1
however , he said the consensus among school officials at the time was that it did n't warrant dismissal			0
the video , shown tuesday on @entity53 , prompted outrage not only on the @entity1 campus but nationwide			2
it also includes obscenities and slurs , which the campus is especially sensitive because of the suicide by student @entity60 , who jumped off a bridge days after his roommate used a webcam to see him kissing another man			0
admission : @entity0 , pictured right with @entity14 , has admitted that his decision to suspend @entity14 in december - and not fire him - was the wrong move anger : in this clip , mr @entity14 , in white , is seen gesturing aggressively towards one of the @entity1 players at a news conference friday , @entity18 said he first saw the video this week , but was aware it existed in late november			1
he said @entity0 gave him a summary of what was on it at the time			2
@entity0 's finest hour may have been when he helped in the school 's move to the @entity84 , which means millions in additional revenue by way of television contracts and more national exposure , especially in football			2
the move , which becomes official in 2014 , should provide a big boost to the program in recruiting and season ticket sales			0
the @entity95 will continue to play next season in the @entity97			0
@entity0 's first major move as athletic director came in may 2010 , when he hired the volatile @entity14 away from @entity100 , which he took to two @entity103 tournament appearances			1
‘ he convinced me he understood his reputation , but he also understood where the line was , ’ @entity0 said , referring to @entity14			1
‘ i made clear to him if he crossed the line he would be held accountable			0
’ @entity0 viewed @entity14 as the man who could turn the perennially underachieving program around			1
@entity14 went 44 - 51 in three years and posted a 16 - 38 mark in the @entity97 after going 73 - 31 in three seasons at @entity100			2
the @entity95 went 15 - 16 this season , including 5 - 13 in the league			0
' this was a failure of process			0
i regret that i did not ask to see this video when @entity0 first told me of its existence , ' @entity18 said			2
' i want to apologize to the entire @entity1 community for the negative impact that this situation has had on @entity1			2
' i also apologize to the @entity126 community and all of us who share their values for the homophobic slurs shown on that video			0
i personally know how hurtful that language can be			0
' based on the information he received from @entity0 , @entity18 said he ' agreed with and supported his recommendation to suspend , rather than fire , coach rice at that time			1
it was not until tuesday evening of this week , when i watched the video , that i had the opportunity to witness personally for the first time what @entity0 had seen last fall			1
' i was deeply disturbed by the behavior that the video revealed , which was much more abusive and pervasive than i had understood it to be			0
as @entity0 acknowledged on wednesday , his decision to rehabilitate , rather than fire , coach @entity14 was wrong			1
' @entity0 was given the video by a former employee , @entity148 , and the decision was made in december to suspend @entity14 for three games , fine and dock him pay totaling $ 75,000 and order him to attend anger management classes			1
the 42 - year - old @entity0 is a @entity1 graduate who played tight end for the @entity95 from 1989 - 93			1

' at the end of the day , he has to run this place , day in and day out , ' @entity176 , chairman of the school 's board of governors , said			0
' and i think he is the right person to run this place for many years to come			0
' dr. @entity18 was brought on here eight months ago with two primary objectives : no. 1 was to build a strategic plan for this university for 10 years , going forward , to lead us to academic success and academic greatness ; and no. 2 , an enormous challenge of integrating a medical school with this university			0
' being on the job two months , hearing from a general counsel and the athletic director that there was a serious problem , i think he did the right thing by acquiescing to that advice at the time			1
' governor @entity169 issued a statement friday calling @entity0 's resignation ' appropriate and necessary given the events of the past six months			2
axed : former @entity1 coach @entity14 was fired on april 3 after a video emerged of him shoving players and berating them with insults and gay slurs slurs : in one portion of the video , @entity14 unloads a homophobic rant against one of his players , saying : ' you f * * * ing fairy ! you 're a f * * * ing f * * * * t ! ' ' i commend president @entity18 for his decisive leadership in coming to an agreement with mr. @entity0 to have the @entity222 of @entity1 come under new leadership , ' he said			1
' this entire incident was regrettable and while it has damaged the reputation of our @entity227 , we need to move forward now on a number of fronts which provide great opportunities for @entity1 ' future			0
' @entity0 said in his resignation letter to @entity18 that he has ' spent a great deal of time reflecting on the events which led to today			1
as you know , my first instincts when i saw the videotape of coach @entity14 's behavior was to fire him immediately			1
' ' however , @entity1 decided to follow a process involving university lawyers , human resources professionals , and outside counsel			2
' following review of the independent investigative report , the consensus was that university policy would not justify dismissal			0
i have admitted my role in , and regret for , that decision , and wish that i had the opportunity to go back and override it for the sake of everyone involved			0
