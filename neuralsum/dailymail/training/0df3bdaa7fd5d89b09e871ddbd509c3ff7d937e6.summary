by @entity0 perhaps it is only fitting that the farewell to the greatest links golfer of all time is proving something of a long goodbye			1
@entity7 was first waved off at @entity8 in 2010 , only for the @entity9 to recognise his stunning achievement in coming within a shot of victory in 2009 at the age of 59 , and grant him five more years			1
this interview was arranged to recognise the closing of that window and @entity7 taking his leave at @entity19 this week			1
now the @entity20 have moved the goalposts once more and it will be back to the @entity22 where the final , final hurrah will take place next year			1
still going : @entity7 , pictured in action in may , has pushed his retirement date back another year and who has any complaints about the great man taking more curtain calls than @entity31 ? let @entity32 speak for all of us			1
when his dad phoned him with the news , he settled for a one word answer : ‘ awesome			0
’ this is a particularly apt moment to converse , of course , since this is when @entity7 ’s worlds collide			1
before playing @entity42 for the first time on saturday , he has been at @entity44 in his role as @entity48 ’s @entity47 captain , spending time with a few of his prospective team members on a reconnaissance mission before the match in september			1
and so the conversation zips back and forth , between @entity55 and the @entity47			1
my favourite moment at the opening ceremony at @entity58 in 1977 , listening to the speeches and watching the @entity48 flag go up			1
i had never played in an international team event before and that was a big moment in my life			1
my favourite match winning the @entity47 at @entity65 in 1993 as captain was very satisfying			2
the @entity68 were on a roll , they had a great team , but we just did nearly everything right that week to come out on top			1
my biggest disappointment it might be @entity76 last time , just watching it on tv			0
when i lost @entity55 in 2009 i had a pit in my stomach for 24 hours			1
after @entity76 , it lasted several days			0
when we talk about @entity55 , we get the graciousness that has been the hallmark of his time in the event , right back to his first appearance at @entity89 in 1975			1
he has missed only three opens in the four decades since			0
and when we talk about the @entity47 , we see the hardened inner core of a man strong enough to win it on five occasions ( only the @entity97 @entity96 won it more )			2
@entity7 thinks @entity98 , sixth in the standings , has done enough to finish in the top nine who qualify automatically — the cut - off point is the @entity102 next month — and so it was only natural to ask the captain , who has a psychology degree from @entity105 , whether he will need a quiet word with the player who was one of the fall guys on that dramatic final day at @entity76 in 2012			1
‘ no , ’ said @entity7			1
what , no concerns for him at all ? ‘ no , ’ he repeated , in a tone that emphasised this was going to be his one and only word on the subject			0
neither were there any revealing answers regarding @entity119 , the fist - pumping inspiration for @entity68 ’s record comeback			2
do you think , @entity7 , he will have a target on his back after last time ? ‘ he ’s got a tremendous @entity47 record , but whoever plays for @entity68 will have a target on their back given that if we beat them , we gain a point , ’ he said			1
so beating @entity119 would not mean anything more — he is just one of a team of 12			2
is that what you ’re saying ? ‘ those are your words , not mine , ’ commented @entity7			1
after the steely eye it was time for rheumy reminiscence			0
victory : the @entity48 team pose with the @entity47 after beating @entity68 at the @entity65 in 1993 leader : @entity7 holds the @entity47 trophy in 1993 after captaining @entity48 to victory back to the @entity150 , then			1
did you know the man whom the @entity20 are desperate to keep at @entity55 was not allowed anywhere near the first tee on his first day in 1975 ? ‘ i was with @entity155 and @entity156 and @entity157 ( then secretary of the @entity20 ) welcomed us , but he said we were n’t allowed to play @entity89			1
he said it was reserved for qualifiers , that exempt players were n’t allowed to play it			2
one thing led to another and we ended up at @entity166			0
’ @entity7 had the last laugh			1
his first visit to @entity55 , and he ended all such mutterings about him being a choker by winning his first jug after a play - off against @entity174 @entity173			1
my favourite moment i 'd have to choose 1977 at @entity176 and the @entity177 against @entity178			0
how often do you get to play 36 holes against the greatest player of all time and come out on top ? my favourite round it was my first round at @entity186 in 1980			2
the wind was blowing 30mph , it was about 50 degrees and raining sideways			0
and me and @entity190 shot 68			0
my biggest disappointment i had chances to win several more opens but i 'd have to say 1994 at @entity176 hurt the most			0
i was playing so well that week and just could n't putt			2
that one hurt for quite a while			0
so it began , the @entity7 era , and while there were glorious victories at @entity186 ( 1980 ) , @entity197 ( 1982 ) and @entity198 ( 1983 ) it would be his time at @entity176 that would prove definitive			1
‘ three of the most memorable highlights were at @entity176			0
one was a victory and two were disappointments , ’ he said			0
‘ duelling down the stretch with @entity178 in 1977 would have to be my finest moment but 1994 was the most disappointed i ’ve ever felt leaving a golf course			0
‘ some might talk about losing to @entity211 at @entity8 in 1984 and yes , it would have been wonderful to win @entity55 at the @entity213			1
but in 1994 i was playing so well and yet i could n’t do a thing with the putter			0
i put it round the hole for four days but i could n’t make it count			0
‘ then in 2009 , that was such a marvellous experience up until the final moments			2
i had a pit in my stomach for a day afterwards but the disappointment was buffered by the fact it was a bonus to be in contention at that stage of my life , and the fact i had won five opens			0
‘ but do you know the one thing that never grows old ? it ’s that lovely feeling of anxiety and nervousness on the first tee			0
i still get it now			0
’ talking to @entity7 about @entity55 recalls that wonderful @entity238 line : ‘ i could take out of my life everything except my experiences at @entity8 , and i would still have had a rich , full life			1
’ does he feel the same way ? ‘ @entity244 put it beautifully and eloquently , did n’t he ? ’ said @entity7			2
that ’s why it means so much to me to be able to finish at @entity8			2
‘ when you think of the great courses of the world you think of two in particular — @entity250 and @entity8			2
i was lucky enough to finish at the @entity251 at @entity250 with my son on the bag and did all right ( he finished in the top 30 in 2010 )			0
now we get the chance to do the same at @entity8			2
’ @entity177 : @entity7 shakes hands with @entity178 after winning @entity55 at @entity176 in 1977 and so the long goodbye continues at @entity19 , where @entity7 will have one eye on his own play and one on those who can make his team			1
there are basically only three more chances for @entity48 to force their way into the @entity48 side through automatic qualifying and this week is one of them			1
‘ what am i looking for during these last few events ? someone to reach out and demand a place with their play , ’ said @entity7			1
‘ it ’s like in football , you get to the last seconds and there ’s a player who says : “ give me the ball , coach			0
i ’ll get you the score you need			0
” i want players who can make that putt and win a tournament			0
’ what about the man he has spent most of his time answering questions about — @entity292 ? ‘ first , it ’s great to see him back and i assume he ’s healthy if he ’s playing at @entity42 , ’ he said			2
‘ i ’ve said all along i ’ll pick him if he ’s healthy and playing well			0
back on the prowl : @entity292 will play at @entity42 after returning from injury ‘ my only concern is the @entity299 play - offs			1
if he does n’t make those , that would mean he ’s missing a month of competitive golf before the @entity47 — having missed such a big chunk already			0
if that happened , i ’d have a decision to make			0
’ as for his own game , do not be surprised if @entity7 makes it through to the weekend			2
he did it at a @entity309 event two weeks ago where , remarkably at the age of 64 , he broke 70 in three of his four rounds			2
the swing might not be quite as full and the putting stroke remains shaky , as it has for the past 20 years			0
but he can still play			0
regardless , of course , the spectators in the first wraparound stand in @entity55 history at @entity42 ’s 18th hole will rise to recognise his contribution to the game ’s showpiece			1
it is , quite simply , beyond compare .			0

*veteran* golfer *'s* final , final goodbye will take place at @entity8 next year
@entity7 will play in @entity55 , an event he has won five times , this week
the 64 - year - old is keen to test himself at @entity42 , a course he has never played on before
however , @entity7 is more concerned about the @entity334 at @entity44 in september , where he will be @entity48 team captain
