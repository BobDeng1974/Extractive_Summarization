by @entity0 they have been a godsend for passengers who crave a peaceful journey – as well as commuters who need to work on the go			0
but train operators are axing ‘ quiet carriages ’ – because they are apparently causing rows among passengers			1
staff are said to be finding it difficult to mediate between customers when the tranquil haven is spoiled by those who insist on using noisy gadgets , talking loudly , singing or drinking alcohol			1
despite some train operators axing quiet carriages , @entity17 are unaffected by the move bosses will now just ask fellow travellers to be nicer to each other – a move that has been described as a victory for yobs			1
train operator @entity26 is scrapping quiet carriages on long distance routes , while @entity29 is converting first class quiet carriages to standard class on its high - speed lines			1
crosscountry customer @entity34 , from @entity35 , claims he was told that quiet coaches were creating ‘ confrontational situations ’			2
mr @entity34 , who was travelling on the @entity38 to @entity40 route on thursday , added : ‘ i asked the ticket collector , who told me that they had scrapped the quiet coach because staff were finding it difficult to mediate between the drunken yobs and the passengers			1
it ’s a defeat for civilised passengers			0
‘ i ’ve seen potential for conflict before			0
very often you get people coming into the quiet carriage and making noise , playing music and drinking beer			2
‘ i feel it ’s a victory for the train yobs			0
there are other carriages they could go to			2
they should respect that people have booked the quiet coach			2
’ bosses will now just ask fellow passengers to be nicer to each other - a move described as a victory for yobs the train operator will now use a mixture of announcements and signs to foster consideration			0
@entity74 , from @entity26 , said quiet carriages were n’t an ‘ antidote ’ to antisocial behaviour , but added : ‘ modern technology has improved to the point that you do n’t have to shout any more to be heard and people are communicating in different ways			1
‘ headphones for games and phones are much better , they do n’t emit the noise they used to			0
‘ designating an entire carriage as a quiet coach does n’t seem to be as relevant any more			0
we ’re not saying you ca n’t use a phone or listen to music but to think of other people there and act responsibly			0
’ @entity29 said it is removing quiet carriage status on one coach to increase capacity on its high - speed routes and denied that passenger conflict was behind the decision			1
however , first class carriages are to get a revamp , including glass screens to create a quieter and ‘ more ambient ’ environment			1
@entity107 trains and @entity108 said there were no plans to alter quiet coaches on their services .			0
