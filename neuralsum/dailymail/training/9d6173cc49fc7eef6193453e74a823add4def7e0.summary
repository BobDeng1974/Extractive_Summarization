@entity0 is debating the delay of three executions while the @entity4 @entity3 reviews the kind of sedative used for lethal injections			1
it comes after a number of death row inmates suffered reactions to the drug or were not rendered sufficiently unconscious			1
rather than stop the executions himself , @entity0 attorney general @entity13 took the unusual step of asking the justices for a stay			2
the review will test the sedative - midazolam - to check that it renders recipients unconscious , the state 's attorney general said in a monday filing with the court			2
delayed ? @entity26 , 52 , who arranged for his employer to be beaten to death , may not be executed this thursday as the @entity3 reviews the sedative used in lethal injections by @entity0 state also put on hold : @entity33 , 53 , ( left ) is scheduled to die on february 19 for stabbing a correction worker to death , and @entity36 , 49 , ( right ) who killed his nine - month - old daughter , is due to die on march 5 @entity0 wants the right to resume executions if it finds a different suitable drug			1
the delay would affect inmate @entity26 , 52 , who was convicted of arranging for ' the beating death of his employer ' ; @entity33 , 53 , who ' stabbed a correction worker to death ' ; and @entity36 , 49 , who ' bent his nine - month - old daughter in half , breaking her spine , killing her			1
' @entity47 is scheduled to be executed on thursday			0
@entity33 's execution is set for february 19 and @entity36 is scheduled to be put to death march 5			1
they are among four death row inmates who sued the state , saying they fear the sedative midazolam can not prevent their suffering as lethal drugs take effect			1
states that have the death penalty execute convicts using three drugs			0
the first sedates the inmate , the second paralyzes , and the third stops their heart			0
@entity0 adopted midazolam in 2013 , which is also used in @entity67			0
the first execution using midazolam was called off after the convict , murderer @entity71 , clenched his teeth , moaned and writhed on the gurney before a doctor noticed a problem with the intravenous line			2
one of the four was executed this month and showed no signs of physical distress			1
@entity79 implied discomfort during his final statement january 15 but before any lethal drugs were administered			0
' it is important that we act in order to best serve the interests of the victims of these horrific crimes and the state 's obligation to ensure justice in each and every case , ' @entity13 said in a statement			2
' the families of the victims in these three cases have waited a combined 48 years for the sentences of these heinous crimes to be carried out			0
' @entity0 , as well as @entity67 , uses midazolam as one of three drugs in lethal injection executions			1
the second drug serves to paralyze the inmate and the third one is used to stop his heart			0
last april , @entity0 used midazolam for the first time in the execution of death row inmate @entity71 , who clenched his teeth , moaned and writhed on the gurney before a doctor noticed a problem with the intravenous line and the execution was called off			1
@entity71 died 43 minutes after the procedure began			0
decision to make : @entity0 attorney general @entity13 must decide whether to halt the executions an investigation found he died due to the lethal drugs he was given			2
@entity0 revamped its procedures in response to the @entity71 execution , including a fivefold increase in the amount of midazolam used			0
' two federal courts have previously held the current protocol as constitutional , and we believe the @entity3 will find the same , ' @entity13 said .			0
