by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor @entity2 today claims he is like @entity3 in an extraordinary attempt to prove he is up to the job of leading his party			2
the @entity9 leader compares the @entity11 ’s grip on the challenges faced by @entity13 in the 1970s to his own ideas about how the country should be run			1
but @entity17 former foreign secretary sir @entity16 said mr @entity2 has as much claim to the mantle of @entity3 as ' @entity20 had to that of @entity22 '			1
labour leader @entity2 likened himself to @entity3 who he said was a conviction politician who understood the challenges @entity13 faced mr @entity2 used a speech at the @entity27 annual conference today at the @entity28 in @entity29 to praise eurosceptics a succession of political leaders , including @entity33 and @entity34 , have sought to portray themselves as the heir to @entity3 ’s brand of conviction politics			1
but as the son of a @entity39 who advocates greater state intervention , mr @entity2 is probably the most unlikely			0
in a documentary to be broadcast tonight – called ‘ what does @entity2 really think ? ’ – the @entity9 leader tries to draw parallels with his own struggle to appear relevant to 21st century @entity13 with @entity3 ’s early stages as @entity17 leader			1
@entity48 today urged @entity34 to ' put on that pineapple - coloured wig ' and emulate @entity3 in his talks with the @entity51 ‘ she was a conviction politician and i think conviction really matters , ’ mr @entity2 tells @entity52			1
‘ i think that in the 1970s , it was a similar moment , and that is the biggest parallel			0
' it was a similar moment in the sense that a sense of the old order was crumbling and it was n’t 100 per cent clear what was going to replace it			0
‘ and the challenge of the future , of the next few years and indeed of the election , is who can rise to the scale of challenge that the country faces and who can create a project for how this country ’s going to be run that is genuinely going to make our economy work , not just for a few people but much more widely			0
’ but sir @entity16 was withering in his response : ' i understand @entity2 is trying to present himself as a conviction politician and latter - day reincarnation of @entity3			1
' i do not know whether to laugh or cry			0
having served in @entity3 ’s @entity83 for four years , i recall a prime minister who despised politicians who try to be all things to all people			2
' mr @entity2 appears to fall into that mould			0
he has as much claim to the mantle of @entity3 as @entity20 had to that of @entity22			2
' mr @entity2 was trying to expand on his vision for the country , but struggled to explain ideas like pre-distribution and predatory capitalism			0
he said he did not yet have a full set of policies , but wanted a clear plan before the general election after seeing @entity102 flounder once he became pm			2
' i learned some lessons , ' he said of his time working with the former @entity9 chancellor			2
' i think that , when he became prime minister , he did n’t have a clear enough sense about how he wanted to take the country forward			0
' and so i learned that lesson , and i ’m not somebody who is going to go into the coming election not being clear about where i want to take the country afterwards			0
' however , mr @entity2 may struggle to corner the market in @entity117 conviction politics			0
today @entity48 urged @entity34 to assume the defiant positioning – and dress sense – of the former @entity17 pm in his dealings with @entity121			1
mr @entity34 is facing growing calls from his own own party to take a tough stance during talks this week on a seven - year budget deal for thew @entity51			1
writing in his column in the @entity128 today , mr @entity48 said : ‘ it is time for @entity34 to put on that pineapple - coloured wig and powder blue suit , whirl his handbag round his head and bring it crashing to the table with the words no , non , nein , neen , nee , ne , ei and ochi , until they get the message			1

@entity9 leader hails @entity3 as a ' conviction politician ' who understood the big challenges facing @entity13
he is the latest party leader to try to invoke the former @entity17 pm
sir @entity16 says he has as much claim to the @entity3 mantle as ' @entity20 had to that of @entity22 '
@entity48 says @entity34 must ' put on that pineapple - coloured wig ' and emulate the @entity11 in this weeks @entity51 budget talks
