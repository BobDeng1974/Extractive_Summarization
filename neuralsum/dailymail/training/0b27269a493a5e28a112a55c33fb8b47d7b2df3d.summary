it has n't been the most successful year for @entity1			1
the quintessentially @entity3 brand , which was once at the height of fashion , suffered four consecutive profit warnings - the last resulted in nearly a fifth of its value being wiped in a day			0
at its peak , in may 2012 , the share price was nearly 2,500p ; last month it was under 700p			1
creative director @entity12 , who was credited with making the brand what is was , announced her departure back in june 2013 , and @entity17 ceo , @entity16 , left in march			0
but @entity1 refuses to admit defeat and the pulling out all the stops to make a comeback			2
on the mend ? it has n't been the best year for @entity3 brand @entity1 , which is fronted by @entity23 and saw its share price drop to under 700p			1
but the brand is hoping to make a big comeback with its latest offerings the brand 's first port of call ? a tongue - in - cheek @entity32 campaign - with gifts starting from a more purse - friendly £ 80			1
there 's phone covers at £ 80 , tasselled keyrings at £ 90 , and totes at £ 495 - a far cry from the eye - watering £ 2,500 @entity23 bag unveiled earlier this year			1
clearly trying to keep up with younger audiences , @entity1 has unveiled the new @entity43 - a range of electric brights totes and rain boots , which they say are perfect for countryside walks and stomping through city puddles			2
the @entity32 advert , which shows a family trying to outdo each other with presents and the grandmother winning the seal of approval by gifting her granddaughter with a new @entity1 bag , shows the brand 's more modern new direction			1
the brand is also catering to furry friends this @entity32 and has collaborated with luxury dog and cat outfitters @entity63 for a capsule collection of collars ( £ 80 ) and leads ( £ 110 )			1
thrifty : clearly trying to keep up with younger audiences , @entity1 has unveiled the new @entity43 - a range of electric brights totes priced at £ 495 catering to a wide audience : the brand is also catering to furry friends this @entity32 and has collaborated with luxury dog and cat outfitters @entity77 & @entity78 for a capsule collection of collars ( £ 80 ) and leads ( £ 110 ) perhaps in an attempt to give @entity83 a run for its money , @entity1 has also introduced a complimentary monogramming service over the festive period			1
there are monogramming bars in the @entity90 on new @entity91 and in the brand ’s @entity93 space			0
as well as standard letter and number symbols , there 's also a set of exclusive @entity32 symbols including a christmas tree , present with bow , holly sprig and snowflake			0
so will the brand 's efforts pay off ? @entity106 , fashion business expert at @entity108 , said : ' @entity1 has failed to replicate the stratospheric sales of the @entity111 bag with sales peaking in 2011			1
' the recent launch of the blossom range combines stand out colours and more affordable pieces			0
increasing volume sales could be the answer , attracting customers wanting to buy into the brand but who find the more classic handbag price tags prohibitive			2
it 's a dog 's life : the collars and leads come in bright colours just like the new bags and purses ' the contemporary designs of the @entity23 range may hit the spot with younger customers new to the brand ; but may , in contrast , turn off existing older customers who do not buy into the more obvious celebrity endorsement			1
' founded in 1971 in @entity138 by @entity139 and his mother , @entity140 , @entity1 started out making belts , leather goods and scotchgrain holdalls , ' clipper bags '			2
talented @entity145 @entity12 took over the design helm in 2007 and was credited with creating the ' @entity111 ' satchel , inspired by @entity148 , which still accounts for 27 per cent of sales , and propelled the company into the fastest - growing luxury brand of 2011			0
@entity16 , former managing director of @entity153 , was brought in with a remit to raise quality and , more importantly , prices			0
but it did n't quite go to plan			0
personal stamp : @entity1 has also introduced a complimentary monogramming service over the festive period after less than three months , @entity12 announced she was leaving and prices sky - rocketed			2
a @entity162 , which in 2009 cost £ 495 , is now £ 895 , while a black ostrich @entity165 tote costs £ 5,500			1
@entity166 , managing partner of @entity167 & @entity168 at @entity169 , thinks @entity1 may have hit the spot with the new range			2
she said : ' as we come out of the recession , luxury brands are starting to pick sides - either increasing their prices aligned with ultra-luxe , or decreasing their prices to become more affordable luxury			0
it ’s becoming increasingly difficult to play the middle ground			0
' @entity1 is clearly playing the affordable luxury game , appealing to a wide range of luxury brand aspirants by offering giftable products that appeal and are affordable to a wide range of people			1
' by offering fun coloured products , personalisation , and personal shoppers , they are really pulling out the stops to ensure that their product appeals to a broad range of people			0
ultimately this is likely to be a great strategy to drive sales for the holiday season			0
' famous fans : the ' @entity111 ' satchel , inspired by @entity148 , left , still accounts for 27 per cent of sales , while @entity23 , right , was snapped up to design her own range of bags for the @entity3 brand			0

@entity1 unveils bag priced at £ 495
phone cases start at £ 80 and there 's dog collars , too
*retail* experts say contemporary designs may appeal to younger customers
may , however , turn off existing older customers
brand 's share price was nearly 2,500p in 2012 ; last month it was under 700p
