@entity2 senator @entity1 's father has revived the birther conspiracy theories by saying that the president should be sent ' back to @entity5 , back to @entity6 '			1
@entity7 was speaking at an event on @entity9 during his son 's @entity11 campaign 2012			1
the video was unearthed by @entity14 , and senator @entity1 's staff is now trying to distance themselves from the man he has repeatedly called ' his hero '			1
during the 2012 event , the elder mr @entity1 denounces the @entity22 administrations work and goes on to draw on the president 's upbringing			1
he goes to espouse concerns about the @entity34 's sustainable development implementation plan called @entity38 , and the organization 's @entity39 - both of which are lighning rods for conservatives who fear the overreach of outside organizations on national sovereignty			2
' they are pushing very hard for the @entity34 to have taxing authority and @entity22 is very much one of the big promoters of this , ' he says			0
' we need to send @entity22 back to @entity51			2
i 'd like to send him back to @entity5 , back to @entity6			2
' his hero : @entity1 has refused to denounce the comments and has repeatedly spoken about how he looks up to his 74 - year - old father @entity55 making it clear that the speech was connected to the then - ongoing campaign that his son was waging , he followed the controversial statement with a concluding one after the applause broke : ' we absolutely need to retake the @entity11			2
' @entity14 , the liberal website that published the video , is the same site that unearthed the video of former @entity2 presidential candidate @entity67 writing off ' 47 per cent ' of the @entity69 electorate who were not going to vote for him because they benefited from government handouts			0
when the video was made public on thursday , senator @entity1 's spokesman responded saying that @entity55 did not speak for his son			1
' these selective quotes , taken out of context , mischaracterize the substance of pastor @entity1 's message			0
like many @entity69 , he feels @entity69 is on the wrong track , ' the spokesman said according to the @entity82 affiliate in @entity83			0
focused on other things : the video emerged on thursday while the president and @entity87 greeted thousands of children to the @entity89 as part of the @entity92 festivities the quote in question may become an issue for senator @entity1 , who is beloved by many @entity97 activists and has been frequently mentioned as a possible @entity2 presidential candidate in the 2016 race			1
if that ends up being a serious consideration , @entity1 will have his own birthplace issues to deal with as he was born in @entity103			0
his father is a @entity105 immigrant and his mother is @entity69			0
the senator has dual citizenship to @entity103 and @entity69 , and has said that if it becomes an issue he will renounce his @entity103 citizenship .			0

@entity2 senator 's father @entity7 was speaking at campaign event in @entity9 in 2012 when he made the remarks
