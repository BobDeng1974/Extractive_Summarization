@entity0 scored his first @entity7 goal in the win against @entity16 at the weekend each time he scores , @entity0 's parrot squawks ' goal from @entity21 ' that – reports @entity23 – sets off the family ’s parrot			1
@entity0 ’s wife @entity26 , 26 , said : ‘ my parrot says , “ goal from @entity21 , “ great goal ” and more ’			2
the @entity30 surprisingly took four games to get off the mark for @entity7 , who have struggled under @entity34 at various junctures this season			2
however , his parrot will barely have stopped squawking during his spells with @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42			0
