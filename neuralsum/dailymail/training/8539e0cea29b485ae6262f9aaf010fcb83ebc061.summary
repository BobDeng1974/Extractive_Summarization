global climate talks have been rescued from the brink of collapse – but leave a gaping loophole which could allow countries to continue polluting the atmosphere			1
negotiations overran by 31 hours as politicians from 192 countries struggled to reach agreement on the ground rules for a new climate treaty			1
a fortnight - long @entity13 summit in @entity14 had aimed to lay the framework for new international laws to slow the pace of global warming			1
but the discussions became bad tempered as countries bickered over who should bear responsibility for reducing carbon emissions , whether richer nations should reduce pollution more quickly and how much aid they should pay to help poor countries adapt to global warming			1
the final treaty , which is due to be signed in @entity51 in 12 months , will be the first international climate agreement since the @entity53			1
energy secretary @entity54 , who led the 45 - strong @entity56 delegation in @entity46 , hailed the compromise agreement as a fundamental step to ensure all nations reduce their climate emissions			1
speaking in the early hours of sunday morning @entity46 , he said : ‘ we have been up all night , we have sweated to get this deal			1
‘ we have unlocked the door to the big climate change deal we need in @entity51 next year			1
’ negotiations overran by 31 hours as politicians from 192 countries struggled to reach agreement on the ground rules for a new climate treaty but he admitted that even if the draft is strengthened over the next 12 months , it may not actually be enforceable			1
@entity56 ’s own @entity73 forces us to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions 80 per cent by 2050 – driving a boom in wind farms and solar panels as a result			0
negotiators hope to force other nations to adopt similar targets in a legally - binding treaty			1
mr @entity54 had repeatedly insisted that all countries should provide clear , detailed pledges of the action they will take well in advance of next december ’s summit			1
@entity89 secretary of state @entity88 delivers a speech during the @entity13 summit in @entity14 but in the final negotiation the language of the agreement was softened			1
whereas before it had insisted that countries ‘ shall provide ’ details about their emissions , in the final version it said they ‘ may include ’ the information ‘ as appropriate ’ to their circumstances			1
critics said this is a major loophole which may allow nations such as @entity31 – which is critical of the @entity13 process – to wriggle out of the deal			1
mr @entity54 , however , insisted it was a clear victory to include any request for nations to provide quantifiable information about their emission reduction plans			0
‘ there are no penalties and sanctions with this stuff , it is about political pressure , ’ he said			0
‘ any deal we get in @entity51 next year will not be enforced by fines and sanctions , it will be enforced by political pressure			1
’ but @entity125 , director of policy at the @entity128 lobby group , said the language left room for nations to wriggle out of the deal			2
‘ it means it is totally up to everyone now whether they provide that information or not , ’ he said			0
lord @entity136 , of the @entity137 , welcomed progress made at the summit – but he said the @entity51 treaty will fail to stop drastic global warming because it has come too late			2
he said : ‘ it is already clear that the scale of action to control and reduce annual emissions of greenhouse gases will collectively not be consistent with a pathway that will mean a reasonable chance of avoiding dangerous global warming of more than @entity150 above pre-industrial level			0
’ previous hopes for a climate deal peaked in 2009 at @entity154 , before the talks fell apart in fierce bickering			1
negotiators have been trying to build bridges ever since			0
@entity159 , director of climate change at @entity161 , said : ‘ the climate talks almost ground to a halt here in @entity46			2
progress outside the process failed to translate to progress inside the negotiating hall			0
former @entity89 vice-president @entity168 speaks during a plenary session at the 20th @entity170			0
the final treaty , which is due to be signed in @entity51 in 12 months , will be the first international climate agreement since the 1997 @entity53 the @entity46 summit was overshadowed by a controversial publicity stunt by @entity175 , in which damage was done to the ancient @entity177 in southern @entity14 ‘ brinkmanship is normal in these negotiations , but there 's concern that the talks will fall off the cliff in @entity51 , like they did in @entity154			1
’ the @entity46 summit was overshadowed by a controversial publicity stunt by @entity175 , in which damage was done to the ancient @entity177 in southern @entity14			1
@entity14 ministers said the activists had permanently damaged the 1,500 - year - old carvings while laying a banner calling for action at the summit			1
the conference , attended by 12,500 delegates , green activists and journalists , suffered another setback when it emerged it had produced more carbon emissions than any other summit in the 20 - year history of the negotiations			1
more than 50,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide were emitted – more than the entire populations of @entity206 or @entity207 over the same period – partially because plans to run the conference on green energy fell through and organisers had to rely on dirty diesel generators			0
@entity54 minister @entity54 has accused the @entity210 of abandoning their green convictions in fear of @entity213 @entity54 minister @entity54 has accused the @entity210 of abandoning their green convictions in fear of @entity213			0
five years after they promised to ‘ @entity217 , @entity218 , ’ the @entity215 have changed their stance as they pander to climate - sceptic @entity213 , mr @entity54 said			2
in a stinging attacked on his @entity222 allies , the energy secretary said @entity215 mps are shedding their ideals to win back votes from the right - wing party			2
mr @entity54 is furious that @entity227 , the minister for climate change , was stopped by conservative whips last week from accompanying him to a @entity13 climate summit in @entity14			1
as part of the trip , miss @entity227 was scheduled to visit a glacier in the @entity234 to highlight the dangers of global warming - a media stunt that would have had echoes of @entity240 ’s much - ridiculed ‘ hugging a husky ’ visit to the @entity241 in 2006			2
speaking in @entity46 as the climate summit drew to a close yesterday , mr @entity54 said many @entity210 had abandoned environmental convictions they vaunted at the last election			2
in an interview with the @entity246 , he said : ‘ there are some conservatives who see this issue as a way of chasing @entity213 votes			0
‘ that is deeply regrettable because you need to be consistent and you need to hold to your principles			0
‘ just because some extreme party comes on the scene , does n’t mean you suddenly change your policies			0
’ @entity240 famously coaxed his party into a position of ‘ green conservatism ’ soon after he took leadership of the party in 2005			0
he travelled on husky sleds across a remote @entity266 glacier to see first - hand the effects of global warming , proclaiming that he wanted to lead a ‘ new green revolution and recapture climate change from the pessimists ’			2
but his party has shifted substantially on green issues since then , promising a cap on new on - shore wind farms , slashing subsidies for solar panels and weakening protection of the green belt			2
last year mr @entity240 was infamously reported as ordering officials to cut environmental levies and ‘ get rid of the green c * * p ’			2
critics point to the influence of @entity285 , mr @entity240 ’s strategist , who has shifted the party ’s emphasis in a bid to deal with the electoral threat from @entity213			2
a @entity54 source said : ‘ the @entity215 green wash continues to fade			0
‘ from trying to halt onshore wind to slapping a banning order on attendance at crucial climate change talks , the @entity215 high command is in reverse gear when it comes to the green agenda			0
’ mr @entity54 accused the conservatives of consciously distancing themselves from green issues they held dear at the 2010 election in response to a threat from the right			0
‘ i ’m not suggesting the prime minister is , but i think there are clearly some @entity210 who think that moving away from their position on green issues is now a vote winner , ’ he said			0
mr @entity54 also demanded that chief whip @entity313 explain why he barred miss @entity227 ’s trip to @entity46			0
‘ i know @entity227 was disappointed and mr @entity313 will no doubt want to explain to his colleagues why he thought it was important for her to remain in @entity318 , ’ he told a press conference in @entity46			0
‘ she is an excellent climate change minister			0
she was due to go and see the problems caused by climate change to a glacier here in @entity14			1
‘ her trip would have helped illustrate why we are all here and why we are taking climate change so seriously			0

talks overran by 31 hours as politicians struggled to reach agreement
192 countries represented at fortnight - long @entity13 summit in @entity14
they agreed to a watered - down deal which postpones the most difficult decisions over reducing pollution for another year
