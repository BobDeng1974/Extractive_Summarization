by @entity0 published : 09:18 est , 22 october 2013 updated : 09:20 est , 22 october 2013 allergy medicine is known to unblock noses , but it could also help to loosen and wipe bad memories , @entity2 scientists claim			1
@entity6 , which is the antihistamine ingredient in @entity6 , plays a role in blocking the recall of painful , haunting memories in humans , according to a new study			1
the research could have have huge implications for people who have lived through a traumatic experience and suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder			2
@entity6 , which is an ingredient in allergy drugs such as @entity6 ( pictured ) , plays a role in blocking the recall of painful , haunting memories in humans , according to @entity2 scientists almost eight million people are plagued by bad memories and have the disorder in the @entity25 alone , according to the @entity26			1
geneticists from the @entity28 , @entity2 believe tiny traits in a person 's genome might be to blame			0
they compared the genomes of 2,500 healthy , young volunteers who had completed an emotional memory performance test and found a cluster of gene traits that were common in the volunteers who more easily recalled painful memories , @entity32 reported			2
the scientists them cross-checked the traits with a list of commonly used drugs to see if any of them had a positive effect on helping to block bad memories			2
eliminating compounds known to trigger unhelpful side effects , the geneticists focused on a set of nine gene - drug pairings			0
the research could have have huge implications for people who have lived through a traumatic experience , such as soldiers at war , and suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder concentrating on these nine genetic traits , the scientists looked at biological data from a group of 340 holocaust survivors			2
by studing this group of people , the scientists aimed to finally target a single gene that was found to be linked to the recall of bad memories and discovered it is the gene for histamine receptor @entity67 ( @entity67 )			1
this is the same gene that when overstimulated by allergies , triggers a runny nose and even asthma in certain people			0
to test whether allergy medication could block negative memories , 40 individuals took diphenhydramine and were asked to recall upsetting events in their lives			0
the scientists discovered that while the drug reduces the recall of bad memories , it had no effect on neutral and happy recollections			1
professor @entity85 , of the @entity86 at the university , and co-lead author of the study , said : ' the rapid development of innovative methods for genetic analysis has made this new and promising approach possible			0
' in a further study , we will try to identify and develop memory enhancing drugs , ' he added			0
the scientists discovered a single gene for histamine receptor @entity67 ( @entity67 ) was found to be linked to the recall of bad memories			1
the same gene triggers a runny nose and even asthma in certain people when it is overstimulated by allergies			0

@entity2 scientists claim @entity6 helps to block the recall of painful , haunting memories in humans
university of @entity111 research could have implications for people who have lived through traumatic experiences and are plagued by bad memories
geneticists discovered the gene for histamine receptor @entity67 is linked to the recall of painful memories - as well as allergies
