ever since gothic novelist @entity1 ’s charmingly aristocratic character @entity0 first appalled and mesmerised late @entity2 , the vampire that sinks its fangs into the neck of its victims and can only be slain with a stake driven through its heart has been a mainstay of @entity10 fiction			1
the new incarnation of good - looking young vampires with @entity14 accents in television series such as @entity16 or in books such as the @entity18 , only serves to show how difficult it has been to kill off these bloodthirsty ghouls of the undead			1
but while we may think that vampires live only in the pages of books and on the cinema screen , an extraordinary new archaeological discovery shows that they were all too terrifyingly real to people in times gone by			0
' vampire ' : @entity30 archaeologists have unearthed centuries - old skeletons pinned down through their chests with iron rods undead grave : an archaeologist cleaning a skeleton during excavations in the @entity39 town of @entity40 , @entity30 archaeologists in @entity30 claimed this week to have discovered two ‘ vampire ’ corpses in excavations near a monastery in the @entity39 town of @entity40			1
both of them are more than 800 years old and have been pierced through the chest with heavy iron rods			1
@entity30 ’s national museum chief @entity50 said as many as 100 such ‘ vampire corpses ’ have been found in the country in recent years			1
‘ they illustrate a practice which was common in some @entity30 villages up until the first decade of the 20th century , ’ he explained			1
even today , the vampire remains a very real threat in the minds of villagers in some of the most remote communities of @entity10 , where garlic and crucifixes are readily wielded , and where bodies are exhumed so that a stake can be driven through their heart			1
the notion of blood - sucking vampires preying on the flesh of the living goes back thousands of years and was common in many ancient cultures , where tales of these reviled creatures of the dead abounded			1
archaeologists recently found 3,000 @entity77 graves , for example , where bodies had been weighed down with rocks to prevent the dead emerging from their tombs			1
the advent of @entity83 only fuelled the vampire legends , for they were considered the antithesis of @entity86 — spirits that rose from the dead bodies of evil people			1
such vampires would stalk the streets in search of others to join their unholy pastime of sucking the lifeblood from humans and animals to survive			0
in medieval times , when the @entity102 was all - powerful and the threat of eternal damnation encouraged superstition among a peasantry already blighted by the @entity106 , the fear of vampires was omnipresent			1
in some cases , the dead were buried with a brick wedged in their mouths to stop them rising up to eat those who had perished from the plague			1
records show that in the 12th century on the @entity117 , a woman claimed she was being terrorised by a dead priest who had been buried at @entity119 only days earlier			1
when the monks uncovered the tomb , they claimed to have found the corpse bleeding fresh blood			1
the corpse of the priest , well known for having neglected his religious duties , was burned			0
but vampiric folklore largely flourished in @entity10 countries and @entity130 , where they did not have a tradition of believing in witches			0
and just as with witches in @entity135 , @entity136 and @entity14 , the vampire became a scapegoat for a community ’s ills			1
the ‘ civilised ’ world came to learn of vampires in the 18th century as @entity143 empires expanded and their peoples travelled to remote parts of @entity146 and @entity10			0
with the spread of @entity151 ’s empire , for example , the @entity147 became aware of the story of the remote village of @entity154 ( believed to be modern - day @entity155 in @entity156 ) after it had been annexed by the @entity151			1
screen version : @entity158 stars in 1958 @entity159 as the count in 1725 , the village ’s cobbled streets were stricken with panic over tales of the undead spreading disease and strangling innocent people			0
locals blamed the spate of unexplained deaths on one @entity171 , a peasant who had been dead and buried for ten weeks			1
they demanded that his coffin be opened up to make sure he was properly despatched			0
when the @entity174 finally agreed to have the coffin prised open , the legend goes that he saw the cadaver had blood dripping from its mouth , talon - like fingernails , long fangs and signs of healthy skin			1
he noted that the body had failed to decompose , and so the locals resorted to the tradition of slamming a stake through its heart and then incinerating the corpse			1
their horror , in fact , stemmed from ignorance about decomposition			0
nails and teeth do not actually grow after death ; instead , the skin and flesh shrink back , giving the impression of claw - like nails and abnormally long incisors			2
meanwhile , corpses can be bloated from gases caused by decomposition , giving the body the appearance that the dead has been enjoying a good meal or drink while in or out of its casket			2
for a time , skin can also appear flushed after death , and blood can pool around facial cavities			0
if this was not enough to scare the wits out of simple , @entity218 - fearing folk , it was also noted that there were unmentionable ‘ other wild signs ’ — a reference to how male genitalia can inflate during decomposition			2
in some areas , vampires were known as ‘ shroud - eaters ’ , because the cloth covering the corpse ’s face had apparently been eaten away , revealing those ferocious teeth			2
in fact , it was the bacteria in the mouth that had dissolved the linen			0
bloodthirsty : @entity158 in his classic portrayal of @entity0 with these gruesome accounts , the vampire got its fangs into the imagination of the @entity243 people			2
about eight years after the peasant @entity171 became the most hated corpse in @entity10 , the @entity244 ran an article about ‘ vampyres ’ at @entity249 , again in @entity156 , in what was probably the first @entity135 usage of the word			0
in 1819 , the year that @entity256 @entity255 was born , @entity254 ’s doctor , @entity253 , published his short story , @entity257 , featuring an aristocrat who had a penchant for quaffing the blood of young women			2
@entity1 then refined the story with @entity0 , published in 1897			0
the @entity265 aristocrat ’s thirst for the blood of swooning and pallid young women was rivalled only by his yearning for fine tailoring			0
when the play was performed in a @entity273 theatre the 1920s , a nurse was on hand to tend to traumatised members of audience			0
but vampirism is not yet consigned to the history book			0
one account from the 20th century saw a man in @entity130 awake from a coma at his own funeral			0
as he sat up , the congregation was convinced he was a vampire ( or vrykolake ) and he was stoned to death			2
in the 1960s , an anthropologist recorded how older residents of one @entity130 island could still recall the killing of the last known vampire			2
and just eight years ago , it was clear in @entity294 that belief in vampires had not disappeared			0
in the remote village of @entity298 , the body of @entity300 , a former teacher , was removed from its grave , had its heart removed and impaled on the end of a pitchfork			0
the six men who ’d dug up the 76 - year - old ’s body replaced it in the coffin and sprinkled it with garlic			1
the heart was then burnt to ashes to ensure that mr @entity317 could not rise from the dead to drink their blood			0
after his arrest , the leader of those men insisted they were acting in the village ’s best interests because @entity317 had appeared to many villagers in their dreams as a vampire			2
the gang also insisted that when @entity317 ’s heart was removed , the corpse let out a deep sigh			0
even though the authorities jailed them for illegal exhumation , many villagers praised them for their actions			0
for them , the vampire was no myth .			2
