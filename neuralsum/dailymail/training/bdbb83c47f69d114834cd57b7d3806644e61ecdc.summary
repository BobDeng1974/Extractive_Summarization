by @entity0 in the towering shadow of @entity3 ’s @entity2 , @entity4 and @entity5 were trained to assemble the deadly ieds that are the scourge of @entity9 soldiers			1
the home - grown terrorists learned the tradecraft of mass murder that they wanted to bring to the shopping centres , cinemas and train stations of @entity9			1
the pair had originally flown to @entity18 but made their way to the training camp after meeting other fundamentalists in the madrasas of the city			2
inside one of the anonymous white washed houses and compounds that dot the hillside , they were taught to mix chemicals and ingredients from ordinary household items			0
plot : @entity5 and @entity4 arrive at @entity33 before heading to @entity3 for terrorist training training camps : @entity5 and @entity4 ( pictured with the trolley ) were caught on @entity37 going back and forth to @entity3 from @entity33 to receive instruction on plotting their attack on @entity9 from nail polish remover , bleach and fertiliser , they made crude bombs			1
then , in the vast open spaces of the tribal lands 140 miles north of @entity3 ’s capital @entity50 , they were shown by @entity52 - linked bomb - makers how to detonate the devices , fire kalishnikovs and use poisons , as well as being made to undergo exhaustive physical exercise			1
once back in the @entity9 they tried to create a new kind of improvised explosive device from the ingredients of cold packs used to ease swelling on bruised or injured joints			0
but they did n’t release that the ingredients had been changed because of fears they may be misused			0
collecting for terror : @entity4 left and @entity5 holding bucket undertake bogus charity collections in @entity33 to secretly raise funds for their bombing campaign watched : the group were under surveillance 24 hours a day by @entity73 and the police , pictured here returning from a trip to a camp in @entity3 charity funded terror : the men posed as fundraisers for a @entity82 charity ( left ) then used the cash to pay for bomb devices such as this alarm clock ( right ) instead of ammonium nitrate , which can be transformed into a potent explosive , the packs were filled with relatively harmless urea , a key constituent of urine			1
the gang had hoped to carry the devices in rucksacks or hide them in bags and detonate them using suicide bombers or remote timers			1
when police raided the bomb factory , they discovered a sample sports pack had been carefully taken apart and the contents laid on a tray			1
in a bin was a partially burned handwritten note which , when analysed , contained identical formulas for bombs used against @entity9 troops in @entity108			0
discussing the plot , @entity4 said : ‘ seven or eight of them in different places with timers on ... all for the same time probably to go boom , boom , boom everywhere			2
’ he estimated that a 1kg device , easily carried in a bag , would kill 25 and injure up to 70 people , especially if wrapped with metal bolts to create deadly shrapnel			0
but it was in @entity3 – some 3,800 miles from their @entity33 homes and their intended targets – that the @entity9 were turned into trained killers			1
the rugged @entity2 or the @entity2 region of @entity3 ’s @entity129 province was one of three principal areas they visited to meet fellow radicals and receive training during two lengthy visits to the country			2
on the first of their extended visits in march 2009 , @entity4 and @entity5 received at least eight days intensive training and additional radicalisation and religious instruction			1
that rose to 40 on the second visit between december 2010 and july 2011			0
in @entity18 , the @entity9 studied at madrasas attached to two mosques with other radicalised young men , including several foreigners			0
both mosques , which are said to receive large donations and funding from wealthy supporters in the @entity9 , have links to @entity153 or @entity154 of @entity155 , a jihadi group branded a terrorist organisation by the @entity9 and @entity158			0
it was formed to wage a proxy war against @entity161 over the disputed territory of @entity163			0

probe : police raided properties all over @entity33 , including this safe house , which was full of bomb - making equipment and documents detailing how to make them safe house : the trio were based at this property in @entity181 , @entity33 , and used as the headquarters for their terror cell explosive : police uncovered a variety of powders and liquids , including this ' cold pack ' in the dingy house destroying the evidence : police found this burnt note that detailed the bomb - making process bomb - making equipment : police discovered a variety of ordinary domestic equipment including granules to keep material cold ( left ) and a pharmaceutical syringe ( right ) officials in @entity3 say their bomb makers were among those believed to have tutored @entity4 and @entity5 in making explosives while they studied the @entity207 with their clerics			1
tens of thousands of young @entity9 men visit @entity3 each year genuinely to study or stay with relatives			2
@entity4 and @entity5 told police they visited family in the @entity214 , close to the @entity163 area , where investigators believe they met trainers – underlining the huge problems facing anti-terror investigators in the @entity9			1
fundraising : @entity4 , @entity5 and @entity220 held table top sales in @entity33 where the cash raised would be secretly siphoned off to pay for trips to @entity3 surveillance : @entity73 had been watching the terror group and had planted a bug in their @entity227 where they were heard boasting about the atrocity they planned shopping : @entity220 was watched buying curtains from @entity231 as part the sophisticated spying operation by the @entity9 secret services but by the time of their second visit @entity4 and @entity5 were ‘ on the radar ’ of @entity73 and @entity3 ’s @entity239			1
they went to the @entity242 area skirting @entity3 ’s border with @entity108 , where @entity166 and @entity52 trainers are active			2
they also went to the hills above the @entity248 region of disputed @entity163 , for years a hub of @entity153 e @entity155 ’s activities			0
it was while in @entity242 that the @entity9 faced what investigators called ‘ a wake - up call to the reality of the region ’ which has become the focus of controversial drone attacks by the @entity158			0
for four hours @entity259 and @entity5 cowered beneath the camouflage of trees while a drone had circled overhead			2
late night : officers pulled the terrorists over as they drove to a takeaway just before midnight prosecution : @entity220 was taken from the car and is detained along with the two other men who were all found guilty of terrorism offences at @entity270 today capture : @entity272 arrested the three men in @entity33 after intercepting them in their @entity274 as they drove through the city in september 2011 @entity4 was secretly recorded by @entity73 recalling : ‘ if i have to stay here for another hour , i will pray that i get hit by a drone			1
’ partially because of the success of the drones , fixed training camps no longer exist in areas like @entity283 or @entity2			0
instead , they are set - up in rural and isolated spots to be used only once			0
religious instruction and physical training are always included and like other convicted @entity9 jihadists , the two @entity9 underwent exhausting fitness training – running repeatedly up hills			0
the month after their return four fellow would - be @entity9 suicide bombers from the cell they hoped to create travelled to @entity3 for terrorist training			1
they were @entity298 , 24 , @entity299 , 20 , @entity300 , 20 , and @entity301 , 20			0
three of the young men came back to @entity9 within days after the family of one of them discovered where they had gone and arranged for their return			0
the fourth apparently stayed on in @entity3 with family until october			2
scam : @entity37 shows @entity311 depositing charity money they had fraudulently taken at a @entity314 in @entity315 , @entity33 trips : @entity300 and @entity298 are shown here sitting and waiting for a flight from @entity33			2

@entity4 , 31 , @entity5 , 27 , and @entity220 , 27 , wanted ' to rival 9/11 '
*ringleaders* spent years travelling to @entity3 for ' terror training '
they wanted mass murder in shopping centres , cinemas and train stations
@entity52 backed group made videos to play after they blew themselves up
the terrorists raised funds by posing as bogus charity workers in street
plotted ' spectacular campaign ' from makeshift bomb factory in council flat

but deadly plan was discovered after bugs were planted in @entity33 flat
police then found explosives in @entity351 when plot was at advanced stage
