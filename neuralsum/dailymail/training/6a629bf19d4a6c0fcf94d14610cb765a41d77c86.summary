mrs @entity10 , who is paid £ 45,900 a year as an @entity18 teacher despite having been a full - time @entity16 rep since 2000 , was suspended after local heads accused her of ‘ confrontation ’ and encouraging ‘ a climate of mistrust ’			1
workers : @entity16 official @entity10 , 58 in front of striking colleagues who will walk out again for two days this week over her suspension the 58 - year - old militant is bringing two secondary schools to a standstill over her determination to organise trade union activities at taxpayers ’ expense			1
there have been growing calls for an overhaul of so - called facility time , which forces taxpayers to fund trade union organisers			2
ministers said last night that taxpayers ’ cash must not be used to fund union reps			0
mrs @entity10 , who bizarrely calls herself a ‘ teacher , union rep , psychokiller , obviously ’ on @entity45 , lives in a £ 500,000 home in @entity47 and has earned at least £ 500,000 since 2000			1
strikes were carried out last week at two secondary schools in the @entity47 borough of @entity51 – @entity52 and @entity53 – with two further walkouts planned tomorrow and thursday			1
description : on @entity45 , mrs @entity10 describes herself as a ' teacher , union rep , @entity56 , obviously ' the education of up to 3,000 children is being disrupted			1
on her campaign website , she threatens ‘ extensive strike action ’			0
but one parent said : ‘ many of us will lose pay because we will have to stay at home and look after the kids , while others will have to fork out for childcare			0
we will be billing the @entity16			1
’ day job : mrs @entity69 was released full - time from teaching duties in 2000 for union activities , but headteachers have had her suspended for allegedly encouraging ‘ a climate of mistrust ’ a @entity52 parent who did not want to be named said : ‘ i do n’t understand what relevance this has to teachers at my son ’s school			1
i do n’t appreciate my child being at home for another two days			2
he ’s missing a fair amount of education			0
’ @entity52 is urging the @entity16 to call off this week ’s strikes			1
the mother added : ‘ i think the school are trying the best they can			0
’ @entity88 , chairman of governors at a @entity51 secondary and a member of a commission that investigated education in the borough in 2012 , said the strikes were ‘ absolutely unjustifiable ’			2
he added : ‘ all the secondary heads and the majority of primary heads complained about her unconstructive attitude to working with them			0
‘ why should the union expect heads to subsidise a post when the person in that post is doing their best to be uncooperative and has been for many years ? they will have to back down			0
’ in tweets earlier this year , he said she had ‘ probably been the biggest impediment ’ to education in @entity51 since the @entity114 , adding : ‘ @entity109 bombs were dropped on @entity51 in the @entity110 and i reckon 5 schs were badly affected			2
do you think @entity117 disrupted more or fewer ? ’ mrs @entity10 has already lost a @entity119 case in which she claimed @entity120 lacked the power to suspend her			1
she was employed as a full - time assistant teacher by @entity51 in 1992 , but was elected deputy divisional secretary of the @entity16 for @entity51 in 1997 and released from her teaching duties three days a week for union work			1
her request to be released full time was granted in 2000 , with @entity128 being elected branch secretary every year since			1
mrs @entity10 was released from teaching @entity18 at @entity131 community school in @entity47 , pictured , to carry out ‘ staff representation ’ full time , while still picking up her annual pay battle : @entity10 has a website setting out why she and others are striking and why she believes she was victimised in july this year , the council suspended her over claims that she breached its code of conduct			1
allegations against her include claims in two letters from local primary and secondary head teachers			0
both said they would not contribute to a council fund used to pay @entity128 ’ wages			0
the secondary heads said : ‘ ms @entity152 ’ preferred approach and working style is one of confrontation and obfuscation			2
she seeks to encourage a climate of mistrust ... rather than seeking to develop effective communication channels or relationships based on trust and openness			0
’ @entity163 , an ex-headmaster and trade unionist , said : ‘ unions should support the right of children to be educated – not the right of this person to be paid for not doing their job			0
’ the @entity171 said : ‘ teachers are paid to work in the classroom			0
@entity173 ’ money should not be funding trade union representatives who spend little or no time teaching			0
’ up to 800 teachers spend all or part of their working week on union work – costing taxpayers £ 15million a year			1
some are paid teaching salaries of £ 70,000 funded by local authorities and schools , but never set foot in a classroom			1
reps are usually paid from a council fund that schools contribute to			2
the aim is to free up a teacher for union duties without over-burdening any one school			0
under the system , union officials can take ‘ reasonable ’ paid time off for union work , called facility time , such as representing members in employment disputes			0
but there are wide differences around the country in how the term ‘ reasonable ’ is interpreted			0
@entity207 survey of public funding for all unions in 2012 found @entity210 , which has 1.1million residents , spent £ 458,000 for ten full - time education reps , while @entity213 , with a population of 1.5million , spent just £ 144,000			2
guidance from former education secretary @entity216 was meant to ensure union reps did more teaching and let schools rule how long they could have off .			2

she was suspended after headteachers accused her of ' confrontation '
she has not taught since 2000 , despite continuing to earn £ *35,000* a year
parents at two schools have *pledged* to invoice @entity16 for loss of earnings
