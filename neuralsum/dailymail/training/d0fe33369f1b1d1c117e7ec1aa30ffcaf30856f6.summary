by @entity1 reporter published : 13:10 est , 21 may 2012 updated : 16:25 est , 21 may 2012 a third victim is recovering from a flesh - eating bacteria in a strange surge in the rare condition after a @entity7 student lost her leg , a foot and both her hands and a new mother of twins was left fighting for her life			1
@entity14 , 32 , has lost two pounds of flesh from his groin and back after he caught the aggressive bug when he got a cut on his side after falling out of a tree in @entity7			1
@entity22 's fight against the condition has risen to national attention after the 24 - year - old student caught it after cutting herself on a homemade zip - slide into @entity7 's @entity28 at the beginning of this month			1
@entity30 , 36 , contracted the condition in @entity32 just hours after giving birth to twins on may 11			1
lucky to be alive : @entity14 watched his infection grow from the size of a peanut to the size of a grapefruit two victims : @entity22 , 24 , ( right ) was infected when she was cut after falling from a homemade zipline			1
@entity30 ( left ) came down with the disease after giving birth to twins mr @entity14 is currently being treated at @entity46 in @entity47 , @entity7 , the same place where miss @entity22 is still fighting for her life after doctors were forced to amputate one of her legs , one of her feet and both her hands			1
miss @entity22 , 24 , became infected after she received a cut after falling from a homemade zip - line into the river east of @entity59			1
her father announced on sunday that she was able to breathe for 10 hours without a respirator , a new milestone in her long road to recovery			0
@entity30 , 36 , was hospitalized with necrotitis faciitis just hours after she was released from @entity66 after giving birth to twins there			1
she is in critical but stable condition after undergoing seven operations to remove dead and infected tissue from her leg			1
two pounds of flesh : mr @entity75 had to endure five surgeries , but doctors believe they have removed the infected tissue @entity22 , pictured , a 24 - year - old graduate student at the @entity79 , suffered a nasty cut on her thigh when her zipline broke and she plunged into the @entity28 , east of @entity59			1
doctors stapled the wound shut , but it became infected with a flesh - eating bacteria on may 4			2
surgeons amputated her leg , but by then the disease had spread rapidly			1
on saturday , they also amputated her foot and both hands			1
now she finally appears to be on the mend , despite being in critical condition			0
she breathed on her own for 10 hours on sunday , the first time since being admitted to the hospital			2
@entity30 , 36 , pictured with her husband , had been home just 13 hours after giving birth to twins at @entity66 when she noticed a painful spot on her leg last on may 11			1
mrs @entity30 is a paramedic and her husband @entity101 is a firefighter , so they recognized quickly that something was wrong			2
her husband rushed her to @entity104 in @entity32			0
while they waited to be seen , the couple watched in horror as the spot on mrs @entity30 's leg grew a quarter of an inch in one hours			1
she has now undergone seven surgeries to remove the infected tissue and is currently listed in critical condition			2
doctors say that despite the strange surge in cases of the rare disease , the three infections are not related			0
both @entity119 and mr @entity14 are at @entity46 because it has one of the most renowned burn clinics in the country			2
because of the nature of the injuries the flesh - eating bacteria causes , burn doctors have experience removing damaged tissue and repairing it with skin grafts			0
mr @entity14 , a landscaper from @entity130 , said he realized immediately after he received the cut that something was wrong			2
' i just out of the blue was n't feeling real well , and i went over and sat in my truck for a minute , and i was feeling real hot , and i started vomiting , you know , so we just stopped for the day , ' he told @entity138			0
however , when the infection , which began the size of a peanut , grew to the size of a grapefruit , he went to see a doctor			2
like @entity119 and mrs @entity145 , mr @entity14 was rushed into emergency surgery , where doctors cut out as much of the infected tissue as they could			1
' i lost a lot of tissue that was in there			0
i 've had a total of about five surgeries , '' mr @entity75 told the tv station			0
@entity14 said he 's slowly recovering after doctors managed to stem the spread of the rare infection			1
' i was told i was just a day or two from being dead or losing entire parts of my body , ' he told @entity160			0
necrotizing fasciitis , more commonly known as ' flesh - eating disease ' , is a rare but extremely vicious bacterial infection			2
' @entity164 ' refers to something that causes body tissue to die , and the infection can destroy skin , muscles and fat			2
the disease develops when the bacteria enters the body , often through a minor cut or scrape			0
as the bacteria multiply , they release toxins that kill tissue and cut off blood flow to the area			0
because it is so virulent , the bacteria spreads rapidly throughout the body			0
symptoms include small , red lumps or bumps on the skin , rapidly - spreading bruising , sweating , chills , fever and nausea			0
organ failure and shock are also common complications			0
sufferers must be treated immediately to prevent death , and are usually given powerful antibiotics and surgery to remove dead tissue			0
amputation can become necessary if the disease spreads through an arm or leg			0
patients may undergo skin grafts after the infection has cleared up , to help the healing process or for aesthetic reasons .			0

@entity14 , 32 , is recovering at the same hospital as @entity22 , the first victim of necrotitis faciitis
miss @entity22 , 24 , has one leg , one foot and both hands amputated as the infection spread rapidly
@entity30 , 36 , was infected after she gave birth to twins at @entity66 in @entity59
