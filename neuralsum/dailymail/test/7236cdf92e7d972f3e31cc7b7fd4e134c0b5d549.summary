@entity1 coach @entity0 is hoping to kick - start his side 's misfiring attack to match the efficiency of their defence as they look to start climbing back up the @entity7 ladder			1
the @entity8 have plummeted from third to ninth after losing all three games over the @entity12 holiday period but they go into sunday 's home game against @entity14 with the best defensive record in the league			1
' there 's no hiding away from the fact we are a very good defensive team , we 've just got to get our juices flowing offensively more than anything and we 've put some things in place to try and make that happen , ' said @entity0			1
@entity0 is hoping to kick - start his @entity27 side 's misfiring attack to climb up @entity7 the @entity8 have plummeted from third to ninth after losing all three games over the @entity12 holiday period ' we know what we 're capable of and we know we can quite easily go on a decent run			1
we had a poor start and a poor week because the games have come thick and fast			0
' we 've had some issues with our offence all year and i 've got to take responsibility for that , because that 's my role at the club , it 's my job to try and fix it			0
' if we were getting beaten by 30 or 40 points we 'd have some serious issues			0
we just need to make sure we find our groove with the ball as well as we have without it			0
' if you look at the last three games we 've lost , if we 'd have got one more score in every game we 'd probably have come out winners - those are the fine margins that we 're dealing with at the minute			0
' a first win in four would enable @entity1 to leapfrog their @entity53 visitors , who have won just one of five away games so far this year			1
@entity57 are the only team yet to take a point from their travels but they will be aiming to capitalise on their impressive record at the @entity62 against @entity63 in sunday 's other league game			2
@entity0 says there is no hiding when facing @entity14 , who have the league 's best defensive record the @entity70 can climb to a season - high fourth if they make it three wins in a row and @entity76 coach @entity75 is expecting a stern test from @entity79 's improving side			1
' @entity63 have a solid squad who all know their jobs , ' @entity75 said			0
' they work really hard for each other in defence and that allows them freedom to express themselves in attack			2
' we 've had some really tough games against them - very competitive games			0
i expect a tough physical encounter on sunday			2
