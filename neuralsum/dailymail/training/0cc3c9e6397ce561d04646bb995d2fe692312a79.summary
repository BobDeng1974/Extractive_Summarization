by @entity0 published : 16:10 est , 20 july 2013 updated : 16:10 est , 20 july 2013 conservative mp @entity1 said the @entity2 must no longer be taken for granted cheats are fleecing the @entity2 of at least £ 100 million a year by falsely claiming that they are entitled to free prescriptions			1
the @entity5 has discovered that patients are simply walking into pharmacies and claiming they are on benefits or a low income – and a ' scandalously careless ' checking system means few people are ever caught			1
pharmacists told undercover reporters that it was ‘ very , very rare ’ for someone to be investigated – let alone fined – while one even appeared to condone abuse of the system			2
according to latest figures , prescription fraud costs the @entity2 £ 100 million – enough to pay for 4,000 extra nurses			1
a new report into the problem will be published later this summer , and experts believe that the figures could climb even higher			2
in @entity25 , everyone aged 19 to 59 must pay the £ 7.85 prescription charge unless they can prove they are receiving benefits , are on a low income , or have certain medical conditions			1
however , the system is open to abuse because patients simply have to tick a box on the back of the form to state they are exempt from the fee			2
pharmacists should ask to see evidence such as a benefits letter , but undercover @entity5 reporters found they sometimes do not			0
all the pharmacy staff we spoke to said they would dispense medication free of charge even without seeing proof of entitlement			1
this is in line with official guidance , which states there is ‘ no question of refusing to dispense the prescribed item ’ to those who do n’t have the evidence on them			2
staff should instead tick a box on the form stating ‘ evidence not seen ’ , which can then trigger a fraud investigation			2
patients caught falsely claiming free medication must pay back the £ 7.85 prescription fee plus a £ 100 penalty charge ( posed by models ) but our reporters were told that rarely happened			1
an assistant at @entity69 in @entity70 , @entity71 , said that when this box was ticked , forms could get ‘ pulled out ’ for questioning , before adding : ‘ it ’s very , very rare , though			0
’ and in a clear breach of the guidelines , another pharmacy worker said she would not tick the ‘ evidence not seen ’ box , thus ensuring no investigation would be launched			0
the member of staff at boots in @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 , said : ‘ i wo n’t tick this box to say i have n’t seen it			0
i ’m not like that			0
’ our reporters did not collect any prescriptions during their investigations			0
patients caught falsely claiming free medication must pay back the £ 7.85 prescription fee plus a £ 100 penalty charge			1
but the investigation process is lengthy , involving local health authorities , the @entity98 ’s anti-fraud arm – @entity99 – and other bodies such as the @entity101			0
@entity99 could not say how many prescriptions it investigated last year , nor how many penalty charges were issued			0
its last report , published five years ago , found one in 50 claims for free prescriptions was fraudulent , resulting in drugs worth £ 100 million being handed out that patients should have paid for			1
since then the cost of drugs dispensed for free has risen about £ 1 billion to £ 8.28 billion in 2011			2
cuts have also forced @entity99 to scale down its anti-fraud work in this area , according to professor @entity115 , director of the @entity116 at @entity117			0
he said : ‘ their resources have declined significantly over the past five or six years			0
i would guess that there is not as much enforcement work going on as there used to be			0
’ the @entity123 , which runs @entity99 , has cut its running costs by 41 per cent since 2006 , according to the latest annual report			2
no new anti-fraud policies have been introduced since 2007 , said a spokesman , but he stressed that the number of investigations was determined by local health authorities , not @entity99			0
conservative mp @entity1 , a member of the @entity131 ’ @entity132 , said last night : ‘ clearly , the system for checking if people are actually exempt from prescription charges is scandalously careless			1
it seems pharmacists just tick a box and they ’ve got a happy customer			0
’ she added : ‘ sadly , this is an example of a wider attitude across the @entity2 system that the @entity98 is literally free			1
everything in the @entity2 costs			1
we can no longer take it for granted and must urgently plug this expensive , leaky institution			0
’ @entity147 , a @entity148 member of the @entity149 , said controls on prescription fraud were ‘ clearly non-existent ’			1
he added : ‘ it is deeply frustrating given that i have repeatedly raised concerns over @entity2 fraud in @entity155			1
’ dr @entity156 , chairman of the @entity157 , called for a ‘ fundamental review of prescriptions ’			0
but a spokesman for the @entity157 of @entity161 said it was ‘ not their job to police the government ’s prescription exemption system ’ , adding : ‘ guidance is very clear that pharmacists must put the clinical needs of a patient first , and not deny someone access to lifesaving medicines because they have n’t got proof of exemption			1
’ the @entity175 said it took @entity2 fraud ‘ extremely seriously ’ , adding that @entity99 would ‘ continue to seek the strongest possible sanctions for people who perpetrate it ’			1
a @entity181 spokesman said : ‘ if it was proved that a pharmacist actively sought to wrongly fill out an exemption , @entity182 would take the matter very seriously and it would be grounds for a serious investigation			0
