by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 14:38 est , 22 february 2014 @entity3 : 14:39 est , 22 february 2014 the @entity6 men 's ice hockey team went to @entity7 with huge expectations but instead failed to earn a medal in a shocking blowout loss that closed their @entity12 run			1
@entity13 rode wiley veteran @entity14 , 43 , and goalkeeper @entity15 to a crushing 5 - 0 defeat over an uninspired @entity6 squad highlighted by @entity18 missing two penalty shots , one off the crossbar			1
@entity14 scored two goals and @entity15 had a 27 - save shutout , helping @entity13 rout the @entity6 5 - 0 to win hockey bronze at the @entity24			1
@entity26 disappointment : @entity27 forward @entity28 ( 8 ) , left and @entity27 goalie @entity29 ( 32 ) greet each other following their loss saturday to @entity13 in the men 's @entity33 hockey game after beating opponents by a combined 17 - 4 through their first four @entity12 contests , including a defeat of host country @entity38 , @entity27 's powerful offense was held scoreless against both @entity40 and @entity41 to close out the @entity7 games			1
a scoreless first gave way to @entity13 bedlam in the second and third periods			2
there would be no overtime to decide the @entity33			2
@entity14 and @entity49 scored 11 seconds apart early in pivotal second period			2
the @entity13 had three goals in the third against a team that looked like it would rather be at home			1
@entity13 forward @entity55 said he 's thrilled that @entity14 , his idol , capped his @entity12 career with a victory			1
' he 's 43 years old and can still play at this level , ' said the 21 - year - old @entity55			2
' you ca n't understand how important he is for @entity13			2
' @entity13 has won four medals in the last five olympics , more than any other nation in the @entity64 era			2
before the match became a rout in the final period , it was a game of missed opportunities for the @entity6			1
@entity18 could n't convert on a penalty shot in each of the first two periods			0
he missed the net to the right on his first one - on - one duel and hit the right crossbar on his second			0
jubilation : @entity78 pose for a photo with their bronze medals after their blowout win @entity82 : @entity13 's @entity83 celebrates with teammates after scoring his team 's third goal against @entity29 ' the first one kind of rolled on me i thought i had him , ' he said			2
' the second one i made a good shot and it just hit the post			0
i had some chances today , i just did n't really capitalize on anything			0
' @entity18 , who also missed a breakaway in overtime against @entity38 , said saturday 's setback was one of the most frustrating games of his career			0
' whether it was confidence or not getting enough chances , who really knows at the end of the day , ' he said			0
' i thought i had opportunities			0
obviously , it would have been nice burying that breakaway against @entity38 and ( then ) you get two penalty shots			0
' you think you 're in three times against the goaltender alone and hopefully you could score a couple of times out of that			0
it just was n't meant to be			0
' no , it was n't			0
almost over : ( @entity114 ) @entity13 's @entity115 , @entity116 , @entity14 and @entity117 react after a goal during the third period the @entity6 wasted a chance to earn medals in consecutive @entity12 hockey tournaments for the first time since winning gold in 1960 and silver in 1956			1
@entity13 , meanwhile , took advantage of two power plays in the third period with goals to put the @entity6 away in game it did n't look interested in competing in after falling behind 2 - 0			1
if the league and players ' union do not let the world 's best players go to @entity135 in four years , @entity18 and @entity130 may never get a shot to help the @entity6 win gold that has been elusive since the 1980 ' @entity138			2
' @entity29 , starting ahead of silver - medal winning goaltender @entity139 , stopped all eight shots that got to him in the first before giving up five goals on just 21 shots over the last two periods			0
@entity14 , who has said he will retire after playing for the @entity146 this season , skated off the ice in @entity7 for the final time with 20 seconds to play and hugged two teammates on the bench before leaping back over the boards at the final buzzer			2
man of the match : @entity13 's @entity14 celebrates after scoring his team 's fourth goal - he tallied two on the day while someone behind the @entity13 ' bench threw a slew of white sheets paper high into the air , the team gathered around @entity15 's net for a jubilant celebration			1
from the ice , @entity14 reached over the boards to embrace every assistant coach and executive on @entity13 's bench			1
the popular player got lifted off his skates more than once by hugs			0
the predominantly @entity38 crowd roared in support of the @entity13			0
with bronze medals around their necks , @entity14 led his team on a victory lap as the players threw bouquets of flowers to fans before posing for a picture at center ice			0
the @entity6 seemed set up to end its olympic hockey championship drought , or at least come home with a medal , with a group of talented players in their prime			2
they did it : @entity13 goaltender @entity15 and @entity195 celebrate after their 5 - 0 win over @entity27 it started well , routing @entity199 , outlasting the host @entity38 in an eight - round shootout and cruising past @entity202 and the @entity203 by a combined score of 20 - 6			1
the @entity6 were humbled by defending champion @entity40 , which also beat them in the gold - medal game in 2010 , with a 1 - 0 win that was more lopsided than the score indicated			1
then , they got embarrassed by @entity13			0
the @entity6 had an inspired start , blocking shots with various parts of their bodies , including @entity215 's chest when he stood tall in an open net			0
@entity14 seemed to deflate the @entity6 ' spirit with his backhander from the left circle that beat @entity29 's blocker for the first goal			1
before the @entity6 could catch its breath , the @entity13 took a 2 - 0 lead 1:38 into the second period when @entity49 caught @entity29 out of place after a cross-ice pass by shooting into an open net from the right side			1
@entity229 veteran : @entity14 leads @entity78 around the ice after receiving their @entity33 @entity13 won bronze for the second straight @entity12 and third time since 1998 , the first with @entity64 players			1
it lost to rival @entity235 in the 2006 gold - medal game and in friday 's semifinals			0
the @entity13 were fired up for the consolation prize and were n't satisfied with a two - goal lead after two periods , pouring it on with @entity83 's goal 6:10 into the third - as a penalty on @entity18 was expiring - and @entity14 scored for a second time less than two minutes later			1
@entity14 , the oldest player in the tournament , started the game with an @entity12 record 41 points and extended his mark with a fantastic game			0
@entity250 put @entity13 ahead 5 - 0 with 6:51 left in the game and @entity6 coach @entity252 left @entity29 in the game , leaving @entity139 staring expressionless across the ice from the bench .			1

@entity27 failed to score in either of its final two matches after *outscoring* opponents 17 - 4 during the 2014 olympic games
@entity13 earning the @entity33 means the @entity6 bowed out empty - handed
@entity14 , 43 , had two goals for @entity13
