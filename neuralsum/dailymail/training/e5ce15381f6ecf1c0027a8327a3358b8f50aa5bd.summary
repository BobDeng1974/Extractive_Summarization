as well as fame and fortune , @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 all have something else in common ; they 're among the most lusted - after celebrities in the world			1
but imagine if @entity0 had n't landed a place in @entity10 , @entity1 had been booted off @entity11 and @entity2 had n't secured a spot in the @entity13 , what would they be doing - and look like - now ? a group of visual artists have mocked up images of some of the globe 's most famous and good - looking stars to see what they 'd look like if they had n't found fame - and the team of hair stylists , make - up artists , plastic surgeons and fashion consultants that come with the package			1
one group of visual artists have mocked up images of some of the globe 's most famous stars , including @entity1 , and what they imagine they 'd look like if they had n't found fame and stylists the design team created some concept images using existing pictures of a selection of @entity42 celebrities showing what they may look like if they lived in the mundane world			1
writing on their blog , the team at @entity47 write : ' have you ever caught yourself in the middle of a daydream wondering how you would look if you had millions in the bank and an endless amount of fashion and beauty help at your fingertips ? ' no wonder the a-listers all look so perfect when you take into the account the ridiculously long list of people whose job it is to make the @entity42 elite look effortless whilst they walk up and down the red carpet			0
' this got us thinking , what would some of the biggest celebrities look like if they had nâ€™t become famous ? would they even still look recognisable without the teams of hair stylists , make - up artists , plastic surgeons and fashion consultants ? '			0
@entity0 looks nothing like the luscious - locked teen heartthrob the globe 's women lust over @entity2 has been treated to a makeunder and is a far cry from the heartthrob we know and love @entity1 , 31 , is barely recognisable without her glossy hair , picture - perfect make - up and dazzling veneers			1
the style she sports in her mocked up image is n't too dissimilar from how she dressed when she first found fame as a teenager from @entity91 with @entity92			2
wearing a hot pink jacket , gold hooped earrings and slicked back hair , @entity1 's look is a far cry from the glamorous high - end style she 's made her own on this year 's @entity98			0
@entity0 , meanwhile , looks nothing like the luscious - locked teen heartthrob the globe 's women lust over			2
with his unkempt hair , acne and bushy stubble , @entity0 probably would n't get a second look in the street			2
with her wild hair and fresh - faced look , @entity106 is a far cry from her glamorous self , right @entity111 has remained very down - to - earth since finding fame , which is reflected in his mocked up image @entity42 heartthrob @entity2 , who stole the hearts of the world 's women thanks to his turn in @entity119 , has also been treated to a makeunder			1
with slightly ginger hair , sweaty , gaunt skin and a wife beater on , @entity2 looks nothing like hopeless romantic @entity125 from the hit movie			0
laidback @entity111 , who seems fairly aloof about his appearance ( unlike his friend @entity0 ) , does n't look that different from the way he looks in real life			2
in her image , @entity106 , who is currently starring on celebrity big brother , has wild curly locks and a far more natural look to the one that 's propelled her to fame			0
the same team also famously gave @entity139 a makeunder			0
with her dark rimmed spectacles , blotchy skin and bushy brows , the star is virtually unrecognisable			0
the design last year gave @entity139 the ' unfamous makeunder ' - and the results are startling @entity149 looks fresh - faced and innocent in the design team 's ' non famous ' version of the singe @entity153 , who has admitted to having plastic surgery , looks much older with her grey hair and winkles the design team focused on features on the celebrities that they believed had clearly been professionally worked on , such as @entity162 and his perfect teeth			1
