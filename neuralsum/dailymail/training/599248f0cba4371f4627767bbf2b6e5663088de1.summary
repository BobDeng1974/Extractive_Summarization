by @entity1 reporter published : 22:51 est , 7 october 2013 updated : 05:19 est , 8 october 2013 as soon as animal welfare workers placed disabled kitten @entity4 in his custom - made walker , they knew he was ready to make some giant leaps			1
footage shows the long - limbed kitten take a few tentative steps forward , and then , seeming to realize he 's walking all by himself , @entity4 takes off			1
@entity4 was found with his brothers and sisters abandoned in a yard with two other litters of kittens by people and cats together ( @entity21 )			1
but from the beginning , @entity21 staff noticed something different about @entity4			2
' he was very lanky , ' says @entity21 member @entity33			0
' almost built like a newborn deer			0
he had no ability to walk			0
' vets diagnosed the kitten with a rare neurological disorder for which there is no cure			1
a lot of heart : @entity4 's carers all teared up watching him take his first steps rare disorder : @entity4 did n't seem to have any control over his back legs , dragging himself around by his front paws @entity21 staff despaired of his chances			1
' his neurological challenges ... it 's just so hard , ' says @entity33 , breaking down			0
' they do n't survive environments like that			0
' as the other kittens were progressing , @entity4 was falling behind developmentally			2
he could n't play with them and vets did n't know if he 'd ever be able to walk			2
@entity21 came up with an idea : why not get a little walker for @entity4 to make walking a bit easier for him ? the walker , which holds @entity4 upright in a sling , enabled the cat to exercise his legs without losing his balance and falling over			1
striding ahead : within weeks , @entity4 was walking around confidently ' we got him in his walker , and from the minute we put him in , he took off , ' says @entity33			1
within weeks , @entity4 was racing all over the place in his new walker - and strengthening his legs and back as he went			2
when @entity4 decided he was strong enough to go it alone , he made it clear to his carers he wanted the walker gone			1
unstoppable : @entity4 is now the one to initiate play with the other cats when before he could only watch made for walking : @entity4 now seems to have endless energy and play , runs and chases all day long and when he stood up and walked by himself for the first time , there was n't a dry eye in the house			1
now , @entity4 has almost caught up with the other kittens			2
he still has a distinctive walk , but @entity33 thinks that 's part of his charm			0
' he 's just a great little guy , ' says @entity33			0
' there 's something in these little ones that we ca n't quite grasp			0
' @entity4 is up for adoption and looking for a home			0
' he 's got so much heart and he need someone who will love him as much as we love him , ' says @entity33 .			0

abandoned kitten @entity4 has a rare neurological disorder and could n't walk
