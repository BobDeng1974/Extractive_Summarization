final plans for a new reversible usb cable were announced last week			1
but now it appears that @entity3 is going a step further , with rumours that its @entity7 cable will be reversible at both ends			1
new photos that have emerged of the cable show it has a ' floating ' centre			2
the new photo suggests that @entity3 ’s @entity7 cable is set to become even easier to use because it will be reversible at both ends			1
@entity17 's image hints that @entity3 's next cable will have a reversible usb port ( pictured right ) , with a floating centre instead of fixed pins ( plug pictured left ) @entity3 @entity23 , based in @entity24 , @entity25 , has shared a photo that suggests the new @entity7 is completely reversible at both ends , so the frustration of jabbing at usb ports blindly to insert cables may be over			1
just like the usb 3.1 @entity32 , @entity3 's new cable will reportedly feature a reversible usb port that will plug into computers more easily , and it could be available as soon as next month			1
the picture suggests that the cable has a ' floating ' centre , instead of pins fixed down one side , so it can be inserted into a usb port either way experts say that the cable will use usb 3.0 technology – an improvement on the current cable ’s @entity47			1
last week , the @entity49 unveiled its @entity50 ( pictured ) which is reversible and slimmer than previous standards			0
no release date was announced , but @entity3 's @entity7 - which is rumoured to boast a reversible usb port too - could be launched as soon as next month along with the @entity54 6 @entity3 launched its @entity7 cable alongside the @entity54 in 2012 and it was the first charging cable that could be plugged into a smartphone or tablet either way up			1
it is thought that the new cables might accompany the @entity54 6 , which is set to launch on september 9			1
the usb type - c connector is a completely new design			2
it has been created for use with thinner , sleeker devices , such as tablets and ultrabooks			0
it claims to be robust enough for laptops and slim enough for smartphones			0
it is being built on existing @entity33 and usb 2.0 technologies			0
the plug is smaller than current laptop connectors , and more closely resembles the size of the current 2.0 @entity73			0
crucially , it will be reversible , meaning it will work whichever way it is plugged in			2
but @entity3 's next generation @entity7 cable could be reversible at both ends			2
it might also launch sooner than the @entity78 a usb 3.0 cable would support hd audio , which means that @entity3 ’s earphones could be upgraded and connect through the @entity54 's lightning port instead of a standard headphone jack , @entity79 reported			1
@entity3 rolled out @entity7 cable @entity86 specifications for headphones in june , which could mean that manufacturers are creating headphones and other devices that can connect to the @entity54 6 via its charging port			1
with the launch of the highly - anticipated @entity95 on the horizon , rumours are circulating about its individual features			2
the latest model is expected to come in two sizes – with one measuring 4.7 inches corner - to - corner and a larger 5.5 inch version			0
it is thought the phone could boast a flexible and scratch - proof sapphire screen , which is about to go into large - scale production in the @entity104			0
the screen is tipped to be ‘ @entity106 + ’ with a 1,704x904 resolution			0
experts also predict a faster a8 processor , better rear - facing camera – possibly with changeable lenses – and wireless charging support			0
it may also include a heart rate sensor like the @entity116 .			0
