@entity2 staff have given @entity4 passports to tens of thousands of illegal immigrants and foreign criminals - including at least one murderer , a damning report revealed yesterday			1
officials have failed to carry out even basic checks on more than 200,000 migrants applying for @entity4 citizenship every year , it said			1
the shambles allowed criminals and others with ‘ very poor immigration histories ’ to obtain a passport – allowing them access to the jobs market , benefits and public services			0
inspectors unearthed one case in which staff accepted an application from an asylum - seeker – unaware that he had admitted a fatal stabbing in his homeland			0
chief border inspector @entity28 discovered an asylum seeker who admitted to immigration officials that they had stabbed someone to death in their home country but was still allowed to become a @entity4 citizen of the 235,000 applications in 2013 , the refusal rate was only 3 per cent – three times lower than in 2007			1
and with two million passports handed out over the past decade , critics said the potential scale of the scandal is enormous – with up to 12,000 cases being wrongly approved every year			0
last night the @entity2 was frantically working to withdraw the citizenship granted to the killer			1
mr @entity28 ’s report – which was handed to home secretary @entity46 on september 1 but only released by the @entity2 yesterday – found rules were routinely ignored			2
he said ‘ no attempts ’ were made to check an applicant ’s criminal record			1
bizarrely , if an applicant volunteered information about a conviction , it was ignored if the @entity2 could not independently verify the information			0
there were ‘ virtually no other checks ’ to establish the good character of applicants , the inspection found			0
rules state that those seeking citizenship must not breach @entity4 immigration laws at any time during the five years leading up to their application , unless there are exceptional circumstances			1
border inspectors discovered violent killers were among thousands of immigrants with ‘ very poor ’ records who have been granted @entity4 citizenship the report by chief inspector of borders @entity28 found that : but officials were routinely ignoring a poor history of evading controls – such as entering @entity4 illegally or working without permission – a ‘ blanket policy ’ that was applied without ministerial approval			1
officials also took a lax attitude to those caught cheating the rules or who were bankrupt			0
in one case , officials made the ‘ very poor decision ’ not to revoke the citizenship of someone who used forged documents			1
there were also ‘ significant delays ’ in dealing with allegations concerning deception			0
the report heaps huge new pressure on @entity46 after a string of scandals involving foreign criminals and border failures			0
mr @entity28 claims a string of damning reports have been suppressed and is standing down at the end of the year , apparently in protest			2
shadow home secretary @entity109 accused mrs may of ‘ sitting on the report for months ’ and called on her to reveal exact numbers of those awarded citizenship without proper checks			0
she added : ‘ when @entity2 failures allow murderers to get @entity4 citizenship the home secretary should take action and not seek to manage the bad news			1
’ campaign group @entity122 called the situation a ‘ shambles ’			0
@entity125 , chairman of the @entity127 home affairs committee , called the ‘ shocking ’ report the ‘ most damming i have seen emanate from the chief inspector ’s office ’			2
immigration and security minister @entity132 said the government was still clearing up the ‘ mess ’ it inherited – including @entity137 ’s decision in 2007 to grant large numbers the right to remain in @entity4 indefinitely even if they did not meet the rules			2
migrants who have flouted immigration laws will now be banned from becoming @entity4 citizens for at least ten years , he announced			1
a spokesman for @entity147 called the case of the foreign killer being granted citizenship ‘ regrettable ’			2
to get hold of a @entity4 passport , a migrant first needs to gain citizenship			1
to qualify for that first stage , applicants must be of ‘ good character , able to communicate in @entity158 and not have been in breach of immigration rules while living in the @entity4 ’			2
in recent years , migrants ’ @entity158 has been tested by requiring them to sit an exam or sitting the ‘ life in the @entity4 ’ test – a multiple choice quiz on @entity4 history , laws and public services			1
the final decision is taken by the @entity2 ’s @entity171 team – which is the department inspected by @entity28 for yesterday ’s devastating report			2
once approved , the applicant is expected to attend a citizenship ceremony and swear an oath of allegiance to the @entity177			0
citizenship gives full access to @entity4 ’s jobs market , benefits and state services			1
the rules on @entity4 citizenship are supposedly strict to reflect the huge rights and benefits it conveys			1
but , with passports being handed out at a record rate of more than 200,000 every year , it has also turned into a huge money - spinner for the @entity2			0
on average , the cost of processing an application is £ 144			0
the cost to a migrant of applying is £ 906 – a profit of £ 762			0
in 2013 , the @entity2 raked in £ 152million dealing with citizenship claims .			0
