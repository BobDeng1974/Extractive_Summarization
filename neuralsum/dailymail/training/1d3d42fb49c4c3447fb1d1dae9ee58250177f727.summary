by @entity0 published : 07:13 est , 26 july 2012 updated : 10:59 est , 30 july 2012 the small town of @entity2 in @entity3 , @entity4 , fell on hard times after its school closed and banks and businesses upped sticks			1
but now a developer has taken radical action - nailing up ' for sale ' signs up on almost all the buildings in the area			1
would - be buyers can purchase most of the historic properties in the ' rustic ' town for a cool $ 2.5million ( £ 1.6m )			1
its hotel is rumoured to have once sheltered @entity41 , who became famous - or notorious - for his ' modernising ' policies during the @entity43			1
bristling homeowners , however , have pointed out that several places in @entity2 are not on sale , including the convenience store , post office and flower shop			2
' it 's not the entire town , ' said @entity52			1
' i live up the hill and it 's definitely not for sale			0
' the community has a population of just 700 , many of whom have lived there for their whole lives and can remember the place when it was lively and bustling			0
after the school shut down in the late 1950s , the main employer left and took the bank and businesses with it , leaving the place more isolated			1
mayor @entity70 said : ' the town of @entity2 has great potential - but it 's a little blink - of - the - eye village at the moment			2
who will buy ? the @entity76 is just one of the historic buildings now on offer to the highest bidder desertion : it was when the old bank , pictured , closed and businesses moved out of @entity2 that the community fell on hard times peaceful locale : mr @entity88 relaxes in the town 's quiet , simple barbershop @entity91 purchased over 50 acres of @entity2 from preservationist @entity21 and through an auction about a decade ago			1
his intention was to turn it into a quaint tourist town			2
now @entity91 and @entity21 are putting the town up for sale again			2
@entity21 thinks it would be a perfect fit for a movie production company seeking a set or a music company looking for a great venue			0
' with just the little rustic community , we could have some antique shops here and draw people in			0
' developer @entity91 is open to offers , but with such a hefty price tag , he is marketing mainly to film and music studios			0
the idea has a precedent			0
actress @entity115 bought the town of @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity4 in 1989 for $ 20m ( £ 13m ) - reportedly selling it five years later for only $ 1m			1
but @entity21 , the previous owner of the @entity2 properties and broker for the sale , said this is different			0
' there are still very few places where you can find this many original buildings in such good condition , ' he said			2
' plus , @entity2 comes with a sense of community you simply ca n't buy - i really do hope something good will come of it , i really do			0
' the developer is working on creating a website to provide more information on the properties			0
expensive taste : mr @entity139 and ms @entity22 look over @entity2			0
will it be bought by a film star , just as actress @entity115 bought the town of @entity117 , @entity118 , for $ 20m in 1989 ? everything must go : coat hangers rust inside the @entity144 the developer is hoping a studio will be able to afford to buy the rustic community as a film set			1
