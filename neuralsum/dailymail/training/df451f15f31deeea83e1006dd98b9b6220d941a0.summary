now she 's setting her sights on a different kind of spotlight - with @entity38 agency @entity37			1
' i 've always wanted to try it but i did n't think my body type would be right because i have more of an athletic body , ' she told @entity1 , ' so when @entity24 [ @entity43 ] approached me i was in shock			2

originally from @entity47 , ms @entity7 is all too grateful for the opportunities her life in @entity4 has given her			2
