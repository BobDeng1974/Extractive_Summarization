by @entity0 a @entity2 city dubbed the most corrupt in the state has won its battle for survival after lawmakers tried to have it wiped off the map			1
the bid to have @entity10 , @entity2 , stripped of its city status came after a scathing audit which revealed that city hall workers had run up hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt and committed 31 violations of the city 's charter , as well as violations of federal codes and laws			2
and the audit came just months after the city 's mayor was accused of allegedly dealing drugs			2
there are just 477 residents in sleepy @entity10 , where a scathing audit found that the city had run up hundreds of thousands in debt @entity10 in the state of @entity2 is located in @entity30 and lies between @entity31 and @entity32 now , @entity10 , a town of 477 residents , with a size of just one square mile , has been granted a final lifeline after being ordered to change its ways			1
and the conditions imposed on the city are severe : included disbanding the 19 person strong police force and handing over power to the county sheriff 's office as well as the resignation of all elected officials currently in power			1
the decision to save the city and strip it of its corrupt structure came after it was agreed that recommendations by state representative @entity52 and senator @entity53 would be followed , @entity47 reported			2
after the meeting at @entity56 in the city centre , the state officials agreed to keep @entity10 and withdrew the bill to dissolve it			1
during the campaign to keep the city alive , a @entity61 group ' @entity59 of @entity10 , @entity2 ' , was set up			0
on saturday , a post on the site read ' @entity10 lives ! ! '			0
another , today , said : ' i 'm so glad to see things turned around			0
' the city 's limits were stretched so that funds could be boosted from the speed trap @entity10 came into the limelight after a notorious speed trap was set up on a road on its outskirts on @entity78			1
in order to create the trap , the city limits were extended 1,260 feet down the width of the busy highway			0
some of the money raised from the fines , $ 600,000 in three years , was then used to hire more police officers until the total number reached 19 - one for each of the 25 residents in @entity10			1
one of the officers was nicknamed ' @entity91 ' because he carried a gun to write out a speeding ticket			0
it was unclear how the rest of the funds were used , triggering a criminal investigation by the state of @entity2 in february			2
beginning of the end : the town became infamous for all the speeding tickets it issued between 2010 and 2012 , the city collected over $ 600,000 in fines the town with just 477 inhabitants had 19 police officers until the ruling - one for every 25 inhabitants once the investigation was underway , auditors found that $ 132,000 had been charged to a convenience store - through a city account			1
it was also revealed that a number of city employees were paid excesses , on top of their salary , of $ 9,000 and the city credit card had $ 27,000 of unexplained spending for ' no public purpose '			0
@entity10 had already become the focus of criticism after mayor @entity126 was accused of selling oxycodone , an opiod pain medication , following an undercover sting			1
@entity126 is now behind bars and has resigned			0
resigned : the city 's mayor @entity126 was arrested for allegedly trying to sell an oxycodone tablet to an undercover officer around @entity135			0
he remains in jail unable to cover the $ 4,500 bond but former mayor @entity138 , who left office two years ago , still has faith in the city			1
he told @entity144 : ' the government bailed out general motors , the government bailed out @entity147 , why ca n't the state of @entity2 bail out @entity10 ? ' state senator @entity53 , whose district includes @entity10 , and who conducted the investigation into the city 's books told @entity152 : ' it â€™s like something out of a @entity156 novel			2
' former mayor @entity157 agreed that the town should have been saved			0
he told @entity144 : ' the government bailed out @entity161 , the government bailed out @entity147 , why ca n't the state of @entity2 bail out @entity10 ? ' a decision was made at @entity56 , @entity10 @entity2 to keep the city on the map a state audit found the town had violated state and local laws with 31 misdeeds , some of them egregious and some of them just unbelievable			1
some of the most shocking are as follows :			0

@entity10 remains on map after state decision - makers gave city last chance
changes to be made include resignation of all elected officials
