@entity0 by @entity1 & @entity2 some years ago a policeman stopped a driver who had been circling a roundabout for nearly an hour			1
when he asked him if there was anything wrong , the man replied : ‘ i do n’t know how i got here			2
’ @entity1 gives a fascinating account of his work as a neurologist in @entity13 ( stock image ) the confused driver , a salesman , was taken to hospital , where a junior doctor found nothing wrong with him , apart from memory loss			1
he concluded that it was an episode of transient global amnesia ( @entity22 ) , a dramatic , but harmless condition			0
the junior doctor asked dr @entity1 , then the hospital ’s senior resident in neurology , to authorise the patient ’s discharge , expecting that his memory loss would , as usual in incidents of @entity22 , return within hours			1
@entity1 examined the man himself			1
together , they worked out that the roundabout incident had come at the end of a 12 - hour drive			2
the patient recalled only getting in his car that morning and heading for somewhere completely different			2
he could n’t retain the names of the doctors examining him or what he ’d just eaten			0
unconvinced by the @entity22 diagnosis , @entity1 decided to keep him in overnight , suspecting a stroke			1
the following morning , the salesman ’s memory had returned , but with huge gaps : had he been suffering only an episode of temporary amnesia , it would have returned completely			2
after 23 hours , the patient ’s speech became slurred and @entity1 knew instantly he was suffering a stroke			1
an arterial blockage was restricting blood flow to part of his brain			1
treated with anticoagulants and other drugs , the man quickly recovered with only minimal memory difficulties			1
@entity1 ’s fascinating and gripping account of his work as a neurologist at @entity13 ’s @entity63 in @entity64 reveals what a mysterious and little understood organ the brain is , not least in the list of all the things that can go wrong with it			1
sometimes it simply seizes up because of psychological pressure , as in the case of a 23 - year - old woman who was admitted after suddenly losing the power of speech			0
extensive testing showed no evidence of brain damage , seizure or stroke			1
but questioning of her family revealed she ’d broken up with her boyfriend that day			0
next day , she ’d recovered			0
so - called hysterical symptoms that have no basis in disease often present like neurological diseases			0
they include paralysis , the inability to walk or talk , blindness , deafness and weakness			0
spotting genuinely serious malfunctions and distinguishing them from merely harmless tics and tremors is far from easy , but there are some symptoms a neurologist does n’t want to see			0
in the case of a young mother admitted with what appeared to be a severe asthma attack , @entity1 ’s heart sank when he spotted the muscle between her thumb and forefinger twitching			1
he knew he was looking at @entity110 or @entity112 ’s disease , a fatal illness that would see her body begin to shut down until it was kept alive solely by machines			0
at some point this woman would have to decide when her life became so unbearable she would ask for the machines to be switched off			0
quite how someone works with that kind of trauma almost every day is unimaginable to the layman			0
what comes over in this remarkable book is @entity1 ’s humanity and his unremitting sympathy for his patients			2
if only all doctors were like him .			0

@entity1 gives a fascinating account of his work as a neurologist in @entity13

unconvinced by the *original* diagnosis he kept him in for further testing
he found an arterial blockage was restricting blood flow to his brain
