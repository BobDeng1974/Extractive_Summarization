by @entity0 published : 17:51 est , 15 march 2012 updated : 21:39 est , 15 march 2012 a spread in @entity2 is a well - tested move for rebellious political spawn			2
and while former @entity8 presidential candidate @entity7 ’s daughter @entity6 chose to keep her clothes during her interview with the lad mag this month , she was certainly open to talking about her sexual preferences			1
‘ i ’m not a lesbian , if that ’s what you ’re asking			2
i ’d be the first person to tell the world i was gay			2
i ’m not private about anything			2
i think you should live how you should live			2
but i ’m strictly dickly			0
i ca n’t help it			0
i love sex and i love men , ’ she told @entity2			0
provocative : @entity21 chose to stay covered up during her @entity2 interview but she does show some cleavage the outspoken 27 - year - old political commentator discussed a wide range of issues , from her love of whiskey and shotguns to her distaste for @entity31 , who bashed @entity6 in her book after the two spent time together during their parents ’ ill - fated presidential campaign			1
but , given the nature of the men ’s magazine , she talked at length about her ‘ party girl ’ image			0
‘ what am i supposed to do , stay in and read a book ? i come from a family of whiskey drinkers			0
my brothers like to drink and have a good time			0
it ’s @entity49 , man			0
there ’s nothing wrong with going out and listening to music and having a little @entity54 , ’ she said			1
though her mother ’s family has been the long - time owners of a beer distributor , she claims to have had a very low - key social life prior to hitting college			1
she only started dating once she moved to @entity61 to attend @entity62			0
wrong message ? in 2009 , @entity6 tweeted this picture of herself holding a book and received a massive outpouring of angry messages afterwards because many found it oversexualized and inappropriate she said that two of the problems she faces while in the dating world is that prospective suitors either want to talk endlessly about political policy - which is a turn off for her - or feel that they know all there is to know about her and her family from a simple @entity79 search			0
as a result , she is currently single - which she is very happy about			1
the only picture that accompanied the @entity2 interview is one of her wearing a glittery red dress , lying on a bed			1
her much - talked - about cleavage does show , however , and this is not the first time			0
@entity6 ’s breasts have been the subject of public discussion for years , with one self - inflicted incident standing out in particular			0
on the trail : in the @entity2 interview , @entity6 said that she went up four dress sizes during the 2008 campaign , seen here with her father and mother , because of a diet of @entity101 and candy bars the blonde was the center of a firestorm after she tweeted a picture of herself at home wearing a low - cut tank top and holding an @entity110 book beside her in october 2009			1
after receiving a flood of angry responses , she tweeted : ‘ so i took a fun picture not thinking anything about what i was wearing but apparently anything other than a pantsuit i am a slut , this is why i have been considering deleting my twitter account , what once was fun now just seems like a vessel for harassment			0
’ the incident , though she later admitted was a life lesson , did not change her attitude and she does n’t think twice about having fun with friends at bars			1
she said that she has embraced the advice of fellow buxom blonde @entity131 and likes to flaunts her assets from time to time without care of repercussion			0
reflecting on the 2008 campaign trail , she said that she gained weight by living off @entity101 and candy and even went up four dress sizes			1
work and play : @entity6 is a regular columnist for @entity138 and is a commentator for @entity140 as she originally wrote in her book , @entity142 , which she published last year , @entity6 passed out on @entity143 when she nearly overdosed on @entity144 due to the stress of the campaign			1
this year , the stress that the @entity8 campaign is causing her is over her lack of enthusiasm			1
in the interview , she bashes the presidential hopefuls and expresses her hope that a fellow straight - talking ‘ maverick ’ like @entity159 governor @entity158 will get involved in the race as a potential vice presidential candidate			1
though he has not publicly ruled out the possibility , she believes he is the only obvious way to improve the current crop of candidates .			2

daughter of former @entity8 presidential candidate @entity7 tells all about life on the 2008 campaign trail where she nearly overdosed on @entity144 and jumped four dress sizes
tells the lad mag that she is straight , single , and drinks @entity54
calls the current @entity8 race ' lame ' and wants @entity158 as @entity174
