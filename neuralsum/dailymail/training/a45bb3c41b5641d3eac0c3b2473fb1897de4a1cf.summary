@entity0 has been on the @entity2 pitch just once before			1
he was in the crowd for a @entity5 concert			2
on saturday , the @entity7 loanee is out to make himself the headline act when @entity11 side @entity10 take on @entity12 in the fourth round of the @entity14			1
one day , though , he hopes to take centre stage , guitar in hand			1
for the 21 - year - old boasts many talents away from football			1
not too many professionals can say that an offer from @entity23 was the back - up plan to a career in the game			1
and neither are many @entity28 players conversational in @entity29 and @entity30 , with @entity31 on the ‘ to do list ’			2
@entity7 loanee @entity0 hopes to be a big hit when @entity10 take on @entity12 indeed , @entity34 - born @entity0 — once a promising rugby union full back — was a straight - a student and took his gcse and a-level exams a year early at the prestigious @entity39			1
but it is music in which he has always excelled			2
he can play the piano , violin and saxophone and is on the lookout for a @entity47 - based guitar tutor			1
in the meantime , he is teaching himself			2
‘ every day after training i play for about an hour , or until my fingers get sore , ’ the @entity50 striker tells @entity51 as , perhaps unknowingly , he taps his fingers on the desk			2
‘ i do n’t want to p * * * off the neighbours too much because the sound - proofing in my flat is awful			2
‘ but i love it			2
i just typed “ easy songs to learn ” into @entity61 one day and this @entity63 guy — @entity64 — popped up			0
he does n’t know it , but i spend an hour with him every day			0
’ in @entity70 ’s playbook are @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 and the aforementioned @entity5			0
@entity0 's only previous visit to the @entity2 in @entity75 was for a @entity5 concert @entity77 dubbed ‘ @entity80 ’s @entity79 ’ after winning an @entity82 quiz , @entity78 also appeared on @entity83			1
@entity84 scored above 150 in an iq test and left school with 12 gcses , including an a in @entity89			0
@entity90 studied for journalism degree as well as reading marketing and sports science			0
@entity94 once of @entity96 and @entity97 , @entity95 obtained a masters in chemical engineering in his homeland			0
@entity101 after studying @entity103 at university , the @entity102 penned a thesis on a suit that can be used as sportswear			0
the former @entity109 trainee — who joined the @entity110 for £ 1.5million three years ago — said : ‘ when i first signed for @entity7 i went to a charity dinner where i was drawing the raffle			1
one of the prizes in the auction was @entity5 tickets			0
there did n’t seem to be much interest so i put in a bid of £ 60 and won — it was brilliant			0
’ recognising a bargain ties in with @entity0 ’s economics a-level and the offer from @entity23 , the @entity63 @entity123 university which invited him to study business ( and play football ) aged 17			1
he is also shrewd enough to know that the odds are stacked against @entity10 this afternoon			1
‘ i think we ’ve got a chance , i really do , as long as we stick to our game plan , ’ says @entity0 , who turned down @entity23 in favour of his scholarship at @entity109			1
‘ i saw @entity12 against ( @entity132 ) wednesday in the last round and they were pushed all the way and i watched @entity135 beat them last weekend			1
‘ i see it as a one - off chance to prove yourself against top opposition , to express yourself and get your name out there			2
’ @entity0 scored last - gasp equaliser at @entity143 in @entity145 tie earlier this season it is at @entity147 , however , where he ultimately hopes to strike the right chord			1
@entity151 ’s former @entity150 assistant , @entity149 , is in charge at @entity10 and the @entity7 boss insisted in the summer that @entity70 move to the @entity155			1
@entity151 makes regular checks on his progress and has taken a shine to the erudite and engaging youngster			0
‘ the first time i met him was with the technical director and my dad , ’ @entity0 recalls			1
‘ he walked in and said , “ what do you want ? ” i told him , “ to play for @entity7 ”			1
' i think he liked that			0
when i left he was very emotional and gave me a hug goodbye and told me to do my best			0
’ there is , of course , a danger that @entity0 will never get to play under @entity151			1
@entity175 scored 32 @entity177 goals over two seasons on loan at @entity180 and @entity181 yet was still offloaded			0
@entity0 has 34 goals during loan stays at @entity184 @entity185 , @entity186 and @entity10			1
@entity0 hopes his loan spell at @entity10 will help him make the grade at @entity7 but there is something entirely convincing when he tells you he will play for the @entity110			1
‘ i believe so , yes , ’ he returns when the question is put to him			0
‘ whether it ’s next year , or the year after , i believe i will be there			2
‘ of course , i will be doing well to displace @entity196 ! but i ’d like to think i could maybe go back next season as the third - choice striker and then challenge for the position of second striker			2
i ’ve got full belief in myself			0
’ there is something reassuringly ruthless about @entity0			1
he is also smart enough to detach himself from terrace emotion			0
after all , how many @entity109 season - ticket holders would sign for @entity186 ? and then , having scored eight times for the @entity207 and starred in a 5 - 0 thrashing of his boyhood team , return to the @entity210 as a fan ? the message , then , is clear : when @entity0 sets his sights on something – playing for @entity7 , learning the guitar or teaching himself @entity31 – nothing will get in his way			1
‘ i love it here , but at the end of the day it ’s a job , ’ he says			0
‘ sometimes that ’s hard with fans – especially last year at @entity186 with it being a big thing joining them as a @entity109 fan – then you leave them			2
@entity175 scored 32 @entity177 goals on loan at @entity180 and @entity181 yet was still offloaded ‘ i watched @entity109 quite a bit at the start of the season and the @entity186 fans hated it , they did n’t seem to appreciate that when i was there it was a job and i did my best professionally			0
’ for now , he is fully signed up to @entity10 ’s top - flight bid			1
last weekend , when @entity109 beat @entity10 ’s promotion - rivals @entity186 thanks to @entity238 ’s late winner in the lunchtime kick - off , @entity0 hit the roof			1
‘ you should have seen my celebration in the changing - room , ’ he laughs			2
‘ i was jumping in the air when @entity238 scored			0
i was with him all the way through from 10 - year - old at @entity109 to when i left for @entity7			1
‘ i went on the pitch with a smile that @entity250 friend scored , @entity109 got a win which they needed , our rivals got beat and we went on to win as well – it was a good day			0
’ there is still hope , however , that this season will not be his last at the @entity258			0
at the end of the day , what @entity151 says , his players do			0
‘ it ’s possible that i could be back next season , ’ he admits			0
‘ if we do get promoted and i have a sit - down with @entity151 and discuss what is best , then perhaps it might be to come back here for game - time			2
‘ that could well happen because i honestly think we will win promotion			0
we have a brilliant togetherness and i do n’t think there is a squad as good as us in the @entity11			0
’ on saturday , though , it is all about the @entity14 .			0

@entity0 set to lead @entity10 attack against @entity12
the 21 - year - old was offered a scholarship by @entity23
the @entity7 loanee still hopes to make the break at @entity147
