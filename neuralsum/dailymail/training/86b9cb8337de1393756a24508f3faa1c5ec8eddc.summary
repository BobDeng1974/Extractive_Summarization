a good @entity1 performance can send the scouts circling like vultures , and @entity4 's double in @entity7 's 3 - 2 loss to @entity8 can only do the same			1
the @entity9 forward scored @entity7 's fastest - ever goal at a @entity1 on four minutes , and became their first player to score twice in one game in the tournament			1
here , @entity14 takes a closer look at the largely unknown 21 - year - old			1
who is @entity4 ? the winger 's double against @entity8 made him the first @entity20 in @entity1 to do so on the up : @entity4 , just 21 , is a rising star and showed he can handle the pressure in the @entity1 2008 - 2010 : @entity23 ( 0 apps , 0 gls ) 2008 - 2009 : @entity27 ( loan ) ( 18 , 4 ) 2009 - 2010 : @entity29 ( loan ) ( 25 , 18 ) 2010 - 2012 : @entity30 ( 37 , 8 ) 2012 - now : @entity9 ( 65 , 19 ) 2010 - now : @entity7 ( 37 , 6 ) what 's his history ? @entity4 remained off the beaten track until @entity35 club @entity9 swooped , but the forward put in his time to get there			1
an @entity39 product , @entity4 's second professional year on loan at @entity29 , scoring 18 goals in 25 games , saw him come to life			2
in doing so , he set a record in the @entity45			0
it pricked the ears of @entity48 outfit @entity30 , who signed @entity4 in 2010			1
he waited until he was 18 under @entity51 rules , as did @entity30 , and it paid off			0
we could have been introduced to @entity4 in the @entity53 , after @entity54 called him up to the 30 - man squad for @entity56 , but an unfortunate ankle injury prevailed			2
an unnamed @entity59 team bid £ 8million in 2011 , which was turned down , before @entity60 got their man for an undisclosed fee in 2012			0
goal : @entity4 shoots to score his second goal against @entity8 , bringing his tally to six for his country @entity67 : @entity4 's first stole the show of the game , though , as he curled home a beauty from the left wing @entity9 : @entity35 ( 2012 - 13 , 2013 - 14 ) , @entity73 ( 2012 - 13 ) , @entity74 ( 2013 ) @entity7 : @entity76 ( 2013 ) , @entity75 ( 2010 ) what 's his goalscoring record like ? statistics do n't lie , and neither do @entity4 's			1
since moving to @entity60 , the forward has performed admirably on the wing , scoring 19 in 65 in the @entity35			2
he has bags of potential , particularly at such a young age , and showed he can bring that to the world stage against @entity8			0
his brace in the @entity90 finale brought his total for @entity7 to six in 37 games , and @entity4 could have had his hat - trick had it not been for heroic defending from @entity95 's @entity94 , who was given a run for his money by his pacey counterpart			1
has he adapted well to new countries ? from @entity7 , to @entity100 , then @entity101 - and even @entity102 - @entity4 has taken to each well			1
it would be unfair to compare the @entity48 and @entity35 to that in @entity105 , but there seem to be no causes for concern should @entity4 attract interest from the likes of @entity111 , as he did in 2011 , or others			1
@entity4 has spent two years in @entity101 , winning the title twice , and seems comfortable			0
opponent : @entity4 gave @entity95 defender @entity94 a run for his money in @entity8 's 3 - 2 win has he attracted interested ? for a largely unknown player , @entity4 has been on many a shortlist			1
most notably in @entity105 is that of @entity111 who , during his @entity30 days , were reported to have sent scouts to @entity100			1
there have also been @entity48 giants @entity124 on the hunt and the anonymous @entity59 club whose £ 8m could not tempt him to @entity128			0
is it time he tested his mettle in the @entity131 ? it is known to be the most demanding - and rewarding - league in the world , so no wonder most players aim for @entity105			0
@entity4 would surely fit in , given the two impressive goals he bagged against @entity8 to become the first @entity20 to ever bag a brace in a @entity1 match			2
there , he more than held his own against an array of stars , including @entity143 , @entity144 and @entity145 to name a few			0
he would , though , have to up his physical game			0
@entity4 , for all his technical ability when it comes to scoring , hardly looks strong enough in his five foot seven frame to battle in the @entity35			2
that , though , is something that can easily be worked on			0
celebrate : @entity4 could be @entity35 bound after showing his talent in the @entity1 for @entity7 who could be interested ? as we know , @entity111 already showed an interest but did n't make their move in 2011			1
unfortunately for those at @entity157 , putting in such an impressive @entity1 performance can only see @entity4 's stock go up			0
@entity160 may not be too disinterested in giving the forward his chance in the @entity35 , particularly given they lost @entity162 to @entity163 after his loan spell last season			2
there is also @entity167 , who may have something to say about @entity4 's future			0
on his way ? the likes of @entity111 , @entity160 and @entity167 may be intrigued by the pacey player			0

@entity4 equalised twice against @entity8 as @entity7 lost 3 - 2
forward plays for @entity9 in @entity35
@entity111 scouted @entity4 in 2011 while at @entity178 side @entity30
