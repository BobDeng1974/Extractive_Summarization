dressed in drab red jumpers , two children climb to the top of a rubbish heap a dozen times taller than them			1
the shocking scene is typical of @entity8 ' @entity7 river basin , one of the ten most polluted places in the world			1
a list of ten filthy sites , from @entity14 to @entity15 to @entity16 , has been amassed by the global environmental group @entity17 - which says 200 million people are endangered daily in the top ten places alone			1
1 : @entity20 , @entity8			2
it is just 37 miles long but its banks are packed with 15,000 industries spewing chemicals like zinc , lead , copper , nickel and chromium into the filthy water filthy : some parts of the river basin look normal , but 60 % of its homes are deemed unfit for human habitation			2
residents suffer diarrhoea , breathing difficulties and cancer as there are few sources of safe drinking water some governments are working to make life better but in others , the damage has already been done			2
on the list is the former @entity51 nuclear plant @entity49 , which suffered a massive meltdown in 1986 in what is widely known as the worst nuclear disaster in history			1
others , though , few people have heard of			1
deep in the wastes of @entity60 is the industrial city of @entity62			2
founded by @entity64 in 1935 to provide forced labour for the gulags , it was for decades the largest heavy metals mine in the world			2
it has leaked millions of tons of copper oxide , nickel oxide and sulphur dioxide into the atmosphere , causing lung diseases and cancers of the digestive tract			2
the report - which says six of the sites are new to the list since it was last compiled in 2006 - said symptoms of people suffering from pollution include organ damage , diahrroea , eye damage , vomiting , lung diseases , cancers and premature birth			1
2 : @entity88 , @entity60			2
once the largest heavy metals smelting complex in the world , @entity64 built it and forced gulag prisoners to work there			2
life expectancy for factory workers is 10 years below the @entity14 average smog : high levels of copper and nickel have been found in the soil ' nearly everywhere ' within 40 miles of @entity88 , @entity14 , where 130,000 people live			1
children get sick one and a half times more often than those nearby ominous : @entity88 , @entity14 , pictured in 1993			0
two million tons of sulphur dioxide pour into the air every year the lack of good medical care in poorer countries means they are particularly vulnerable - explaining , in part , why many of the worst places are in what was traditionally called the @entity115			1
the report said : ' the shortage of adequate resources in many low - and middle - income countries increases the severity of health impacts from toxic pollution while simultaneously marginalizing those who need help the most			0
' an objective of the work of @entity17 and @entity126 and one goal of this report is to enhance understanding and funding for this crucial area of public health			0
' 3 : @entity133 , @entity15			0
some nine million people live along its banks and it provides 80 % of @entity138 's drinking water - but scientists have found lead at more than 1,000 times the recommended level horrifying : but the report said the @entity15 government is trying to solve the river 's huge health risks the most densely - populated area , @entity15 's @entity133 , is home to some nine million people but also countless factories and industrial sites			1
despite providing 80 % of @entity138 's drinking water it has lead at more than 1,000 times the recommended level and manganese at four times the recommended level			0
meanwhile @entity154 in @entity155 has a more unexpected source of pollution - it is teeming with almost 300 tanneries to make leather			0
toxic world : eight of the ten most polluted places named in a report by the @entity17 4 : @entity163 , @entity164 's second - biggest city , once held one of the world 's largest lead mines			1
children have up to ten times the recommended level of lead in their blood			1
the government did not tackle the problem for 90 years the process of making leather uses dangerous amounts of the chemical hexavalent chromium , which was made famous as a water pollutant in the @entity180 film @entity181			0
the chemical causes cancer and is almost universally banned throughout @entity184 , but it is among the 22,000 cubic litres of toxic waste dumped into @entity154 's water supply every day			1
tannery workers ' homes are built next to contaminated streams , ponds and canals and they suffer horrifying symptoms including skin rashes , acid burns , dizziness and nausea			1
5 : @entity154 , @entity155 , is home to 270 tanneries for making leather - which together dump 22,000 cubic litres of toxic waste every day including the cancer - causing chemical hexavalent chromium dangerous : hexavalent chromium was made famous by the film @entity181 , which documented the story of an @entity209 junior lawyer and single mother who campaigned to expose water pollution in @entity212 , @entity15 , a long history of gold mining is to blame			1
the process uses large quantities of the toxic chemical mercury - causing decades of health problems for its residents			0
the western world has a big part to play in the levels of pollution in these countries , the report said			0
dr @entity227 , assistant director of research at the @entity17 , told the @entity229 : ' [ in the @entity209 , ] your whole body is covered with products whose fundamental chemical ingredients have likely come from other countries			2
the contamination stayed in those countries			0
' 6 : @entity212 , @entity15 , is a world centre of gold mining - which uses the dangerous chemical mercury and releases 1,000 tons of it a year			0
pictured : a coal mine in @entity212 province people in @entity212 eat fish containing up to double the recommended levels of mercury 7 : @entity247 , @entity248 , played host to the massive meltdown at the @entity49 nuclear plant in 1986			1
it is deserted , a ghost town which has become an eerie haunt only for investigators and photographers of its crumbling homes toxic : the @entity49 nuclear reactor 26 years after the meltdown which killed thousands			1
it is now cased in concrete , but there are still dangerous levels of radioactive particles in the soil for miles around the report said several governments , especially in @entity15 , are doing their best to tackle the problems			0
others have been taken off the ' worst ten ' list since 2006 , including sites in @entity276 , @entity277 , @entity14 , @entity278 and @entity279			1
but the report admits there will inevitably be pollution scandals waiting to be uncovered			0
it said : ' these listings , as explicitly acknowledged in the reports , were based on limited information and data			0
' this was only to be expected , since pollution by its nature shuns the spotlight			0

8 : the @entity293 , @entity294 , is home to some of the world 's biggest petrochemical plants and saw almost 7,000 spills from 1976 to 2001 where the oil was never recovered			0
a quarter of children are starving toxic : the @entity293 delta is also home to crime - pictured is a boat which was burned by authorities after being loaded with stolen oil			0
an average of 240,000 barrels of crude oil are spilt every year in the area 9 : @entity312 , @entity14 , a @entity51 industrial city where 300,000 tons of chemical waste were put into unsafe forms of landfill - many of them seeping into groundwater			2
three of the worst ten are in former @entity51 states entry prohibited ! a sign warns people away from the @entity324 sludge reservoir near @entity312 10 : the @entity325 in @entity326 , @entity16 , is where many western computers end up without the resources to process them properly			1
styrofoam packaging and rubber - sheathed cables are all burned			0

horrifying list compiled by environmental body @entity335
sites include mines , factories , landfills and the @entity49 nuclear plant
the top ten alone put more than 200 million people in danger every day
