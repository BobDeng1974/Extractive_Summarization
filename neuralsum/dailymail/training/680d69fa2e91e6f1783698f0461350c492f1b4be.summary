an author has claimed he can help any woman land the man of her dreams in just 60 days thanks to his dating techniques			1
@entity6 , 53 , who grew up in @entity7 , @entity8 , and now lives in @entity9 , says his advice is based on methods that have been proven to work throughout history			1
he says his book is based on the same principles that helped @entity15 make @entity16 fall so in love with her he gave up the throne , and led @entity19 to become infatuated with @entity20 while they were filming @entity22 and mrs @entity23			1
and yet , so many otherwise capable women struggle in this department			2
so the question has to be asked , what are they doing wrong , and what should they be doing instead			0
' he believes @entity20 's stunning looks have got nothing to do with how she managed to bag @entity45 's hottest man - instead he says it 's about ' standing out from the crowd ' and ' taking control and keeping it			1
' he writes : ' she does n't have to have movie - star looks , or a flat stomach , whitened teeth or bee - stung lips			1
in fact , none of that matters at all , as long as a few simple guidelines are followed instead			0
@entity6 , pictured with @entity56 's @entity55 , who disagreed with his dating advice ' hard to believe ? of course it is ... it is precisely because so few women really know how to land a big tuna that they end up with little sardines instead			1
' @entity6 writes about his techniques in his book , @entity65 that @entity66 in 60 days : a practical guide to love for the 21st century woman , published by @entity69			1
' the book is ' a result of seven years of research into the world of the single women , and it identifies what the successful women do right to ensure that they walk off down the aisle with a big tuna			2
' @entity6 says his principles are based on those that helped @entity15 make @entity16 , left , fall so in love with her he gave up the throne and led @entity19 to become infatuated with @entity20 @entity6 , who studied @entity84 at the @entity85 , found his formula for ' owning ' a man after he found himself on the dating scene again following the end of his 15 - year marriage			1
his quest to find a soul mate led him to discover what he thinks women are doing wrong when it comes to finding mr @entity96			2
@entity6 's book is based on his own experiences he explained as he appeared on today 's @entity56 : ' when i started internet dating , i started working out certain patterns			1
some of the women were effective internet daters , others were ineffective			2
' he added that his sister also influenced his research after she struggled to find @entity108			0
he said : ' my sister is attractive , there is nothing wrong with her but she was struggling to have a relationship and she did n't know why			0
' she came to me and said , " can you help me out - this is what i do , i was taught in college to be cool and aloof , to stand back and let the guy chase you			0
" ' but @entity6 said women actually need to do the opposite of this			1
he said they need to chase a man and controversially , sleep with him on the first date			2
he explained : ' times have changed , sexual liberation has occurred			0
' women need to play it hot from day one			2
while everyone else is backing off and waiting to be called , you need to be proactive			0
' he added of the successful daters he has met : ' they do n't wait around			0
they will talk to a guy at a party and take charge and not wait for a guy to speak to them			0
' he added if women want a man to fall in love with them within 60 days , they need to ' focus all their attention on him ' and make him ' fall in love with the way you make him feel '			1
another tip he has is to text or call a guy straight away to thank him if he has taken you out for dinner rather than waiting for him to contact you			0
be pro-active : put yourself out there , do n't wait for a man to invite you out or talk to you			2
chat them up or ask them out first			0
buy them dinner : show you are in control			0
do n't wait for him to call : get in contact with him after a date to say thanks			0
do n't leave it for days waiting for him to call			2
sleep with him on the first date : give him what he wants and he 'll be hooked			0
even better , on the date , you should have paid for his drinks and dinner and ' put him on a pedestal '			0
this @entity56 's resident relationship expert @entity55 disagreed with @entity6 's advice			1
she said women should n't make it ' all about the man ' and put all his needs first and she was shocked that @entity6 was recommending women jump straight into bed with a man			1
she said a healthy relationship is n't about a woman ' controlling ' a man and treating him like he 's stupid			1
rather , she said a couple will fall in love if they are compatible and honest with one another			0
but @entity6 said women do need to play games in order to be successful - ' that 's why it 's called the mating game , ' he said .			1

@entity6 , 53 , has written @entity201 in 60 days
