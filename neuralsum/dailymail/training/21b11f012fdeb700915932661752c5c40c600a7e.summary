some of the radio transmitters were able to record and emit at at 940 - 980 mhz. many of these rooms included bugged telephone outlets			0
@entity297 continued : ' the @entity10 did not need to eavesdrop on the phone conversations this way , because phones conversations were recorded separately in a centralized manner			0
' bugs were intended to hear people 's conversations in the room , and phone lines only provided power supply and transferred speech back to the @entity10			0
' he added that to record a conversation with a suspect , a spy had to use a carry - on bug , which was made up of a separate recording device and a microphone disguised to look like , say , a pen			2
