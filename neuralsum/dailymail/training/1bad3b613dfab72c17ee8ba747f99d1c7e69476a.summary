a new species of predator which is a hybrid of a wolf and an eastern coyote has been nicknamed a ' coywolf , ' by scientists for its unique dna			1
the wild animal has been spotted roaming around @entity9 and the land north of the @entity11 and was created after humans forced two species to live closer together and mate			1
it is a hybrid of a coyote and a wolf and has about 1/4 wolf dna , 2/3 coyote dna and the rest of its dna comes from domesticated dogs			1
however , the coywolf is well suited to its habitat			2
genetically , the grey wolf and the coyote are close relatives but the two animals separated evolutionarily one to two million years ago			1
over the past decade , this new breed of animal has emerged after wolves were hunted and forced north and coyotes moved east from the @entity51			1
according to the @entity57 : ‘ the coywolf can be as much as 40 per cent larger than the @entity54 coyote , with powerful wolf - like jaws			1
’ it has also inherited the wolf 's more social nature , which allows for pack hunting			1
both animals benefit from each other ’s genes			2
the wolf genes allow the coyote to take down bigger prey , while the coyote genes allow them to adapt to cities			1
scientists have been studying the new bred of animal to learn more			2
they made 50/50 hybrids in a laboratory and allowed female coyotes to mate with grey wolves to try and emulate the coywolves genetic base			2
there were two failed pregnancies and one litter of six puppies			0
and the hybrids appeared to be better at dealing with hard times			0
scientists breed : these animals are 50/50 hybrids made in a laboratory to try and emulate the coywolves genetic base experiment : there were two failed pregnancies and one litter of six puppies among the breed , like this one pictured , made in the laboratory for example , when food is sparse , they 'll forage for it , adapting to changing situations			0
altogether , they tend to do better than their parent species who are not hybrids			0
scientists suggest that the emergence of the coywolves , illustrates how human activity often takes away the barriers that separate species			0
another huge factor is the effect that climate change is having on animals ' natural habitats			0
the @entity116 is warming between two and four times as fast as the rest of the planet forcing animals ’ natural habitats to change			0
as they move , it can lead to more interbreeding .			0

the wild animal has been spotted roaming around @entity9 and in the land north of the @entity11
the animal has 1/4 wolf dna , 2/3 coyote dna and the rest is from dog

the animal 's wolf genes allow the coyote to take down bigger prey , whilst its coyote genes let them adapt to built - up areas
