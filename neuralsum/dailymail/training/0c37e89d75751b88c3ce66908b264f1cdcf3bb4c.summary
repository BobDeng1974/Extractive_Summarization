with @entity1 looking for a late equaliser against the @entity3 , @entity0 stepped up to take a corner won as @entity5 ’ freekick was saved			2
@entity0 , who often takes corners for @entity8 and @entity1 with some success , strode forward , taking three steps before striking the ball			2
but with his right boot he fired the dead ball opportunity into the @entity16 sky and out for a goalkick without any other player getting close to touching the ball			0
was @entity0 ’s effort the worst corner ever ? here we go : @entity1 's number 10 swings his right boot at the ' @entity40 ' ball looking to play it into the box oh dear : @entity0 's effort flies out of play as his team - mates make their runs in the penalty area as @entity50 ’s title challenge fell apart against @entity51 at @entity52 , @entity53 ’ stoppage time short corner only succeeded in finding @entity54 on the edge of the box			1
the @entity57 , fresh off the bench , burst away upfield and the move eventually led to @entity51 ’s second goal which handed @entity61 the title initiative and deflated @entity50			0
while @entity0 ’s corner kick was perhaps more embarrassing , @entity1 fans should perhaps at least be grateful that it did n’t lead to a goal to kill off their @entity68 opener			1
deary me : the men in the box realise what 's gone wrong and begin to head back to their positions @entity74 bowed : @entity0 set up @entity76 's goal but his awful corner was embarassing			0

@entity0 's dead ball effort drew *groans* from @entity1 fans all over
the @entity1 were *chasing* the game as @entity0 embarrassed himself
some even *called* the @entity1 forwards corner the ' worst ever '
