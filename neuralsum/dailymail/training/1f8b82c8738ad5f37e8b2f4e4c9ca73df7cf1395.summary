' fresh breast milk is sweeter and a bit more watery than cow milk			2
the breast milk also helped settle my stomach after having some digestive problems			2
i prefer the taste of breast milk over cow milk			2
' my wife has hundreds of bottles of frozen breast milk in the freezer that our baby will never have a chance to drink before they get too old			2
since breast milk is healthy and we have plenty of it , why not just drink it all myself ? ' in fact , why not drink only breast milk and see how long i can happily make it with no other food ? ' and yes , i know how weird this may sound , it is kind of weird to me as well but why not ? i mean cow milk was made for baby cows , why not drink human breast milk that was made for baby humans ?
