a new ‘ cyber strike force ’ costing up to £ 500 million is being secretly built by @entity0 to wage war with a regiment of computer geeks instead of bombs and bullets			1
fighter planes , warships and regiments face being replaced by futuristic cyber assaults using lethal computer worms and viruses to wipe out enemy targets			1
and the @entity15 ’s tough fitness tests are to be lowered to allow weedy or overweight ‘ computer geniuses ’ to join the new front line of ‘ keyboard commandoes ’			0
keyboard commando : defence secretary @entity20 in the top - secret bunker beneath the @entity22 , from where the cyber wars of the future will be fought and won by weedy ' computer geniuses ' defence secretary @entity20 , who will announce the new plans at the @entity28 conference today , has hailed the changes as the biggest military revolution since tanks replaced cavalry brigades in the @entity33 a century ago			1
he told @entity34 that @entity0 is the first nation in the world to announce publicly that it has a ‘ cyber strike capability ’			1
and he revealed work on developing the ‘ laptop army ’ is already under way			0
future wars would be fought by ‘ it geeks in rooms like this rather than soldiers marching down the streets , or tanks or fighter aircraft ’ , he said			0
‘ more and more , modern warfare will be about people sitting in bunkers in front of computer screens , whether remotely piloted aircraft or cyber weapons			1
’ it is believed @entity59 , the @entity56 and @entity57 have already developed such weapons , though no country has admitted to it			2
mr @entity20 said clinical ‘ cyber strikes ’ could disable enemy communications , nuclear and chemical weapons , planes , ships and other hardware			1
and , in contrast with bloody , dangerous and inaccurate bombing raids , entire cities could be conquered without a single loss of life , helping @entity0 to avoid a military war – and a public relations battle			0
‘ people think of military as land , sea and air , ’ he said			0
‘ we long ago recognised a fourth domain – space			0
now there ’s a fifth – cyber			2
‘ this is the new frontier of defence			2
for years , we have been building a defensive capability to protect ourselves against these cyber attacks			2
that is no longer enough			0
‘ you deter people by having an offensive capability			0
we will build in @entity0 a cyber strike capability so we can strike back in cyber space against enemies who attack us , putting cyber alongside land , sea , air and space as a mainstream military activity			1
our commanders can use cyber weapons alongside conventional weapons in future conflicts			1
’ @entity0 already has a defensive cyber military force to fend off cyber attacks by terrorists and others			1
it will now develop an attack force in conjunction with @entity116 spy chiefs			1
mr @entity20 admitted this expansion is already under way			1
@entity116 @entity119 : the controversial signals intelligence agency is to help develop @entity20 's cyber attack force the significance of the announcement was underlined by his decision to deliver it in an interview with this newspaper conducted in the @entity22 ’s vast @entity128 nuclear bunker , or ‘ @entity129 , ’ situated way below @entity131			1
it is the first time any @entity20 has been photographed or interviewed there			1
appropriately for a quantum leap in the @entity136 , the bunker is crammed with modern technology , including the ability to take over @entity0 ’s entire communications network			2
more than 100 top politicians , generals and others will live in the bunker , built on the orders of @entity145 in the @entity146 , in the event of nuclear war , a chemical weapons onslaught or other major attack			1
the prime minister is the only person provided with a bunker for his wife and children – so their welfare does not affect his judgment in deciding whether to press the nuclear button			1
the new face of @entity0 special forces : a new ' @entity160 ' will be open to whizzkids who can not pass @entity15 fitness tests			1
( @entity165 image ) the room is named after @entity167 lyric poet , @entity128			1
when @entity169 devastated @entity170 in 335 @entity171 , he spared the house of @entity128			1
mr @entity20 says @entity0 will spend ‘ hundreds of millions of pounds ’ on the new strike force			1
the @entity34 understands the figure could be as high as £ 500 million in the next few years			0
it will change the appearance of the @entity15 in more ways than one			0
a new ‘ @entity160 ’ of part - time reservists will be open to computer whizzkids who can not pass the current @entity15 fitness tests , on the basis that press - ups do not aid computer skills			2
‘ a ta for computer geniuses ’ , as mr @entity20 called it			2
he poured scorn on ‘ crude and bonkers attacks by armchair generals ’ who have criticised him for cutting the number of soldiers – and made it clear conventional forces faced more cuts in the switch			1
‘ military capability does n’t stand still			0
you can not fossilise it			0
‘ as much as we love and cherish our military traditions , the defence of the nation means we must spend money on the capabilities of tomorrow , not yesterday			2
‘ i ’m sure a healthy debate raged 100 years ago about whether to invest in new - fangled tanks and stop buying hay for the horses			2
some will have said , “ buy more hay , not tanks			0
” ‘ those who think they are defending our military capability by defending the shape of the military of last year or the last decade are n’t defending it at all			0
’ he spelled out the advantages of cyber warfare : ‘ years ago , you ’d go into a target area and bomb it with freefall bombs			2
@entity228 public opinion increasingly demands precision attack – no civilian casualties , no collateral damage			2
‘ cyber weapons provide the tantalising possibility of being able to cripple the enemy without inflicting lasting damage on them			2
‘ no cities to rebuild , no infrastructure to reconstruct			0
one of my @entity56 counterparts put it to me like this : “ why would you want to bomb someone ’s airfield if you could just switch it off with a cyber attack ? ” ’ it will mean further cuts in soldiers , airmen , sailors , tanks , ships , fighter planes and more – though mr @entity20 refused to say where the axe will fall			1
‘ we only have one pot of money and if we going to invest hundreds of millions of pounds in cyber capabilities , we have to stop doing something else			0
‘ that is the tough message			0
as our cyber capability builds , we will look at how the military would be likely to use it and where that allows us to reduce other capabilities			0
‘ where we can tackle a target with cyber weapons , we may need fewer conventional weapons in that area but i ca n’t say yet where those areas will be			1
it will be a constant evolution			0
‘ the trigger of the gun , bomb or missile will always have a role but as the world becomes more dependent on it systems , one way of delivering incapacitating blow to the enemy will be by delivering a blow to his it systems			0
’ facing further cuts : @entity20 admitted that the funds for his cyber army would lead to less for other forces unlike soldiers marching in the street , the @entity136 ’ computer geeks would be invisible , but no less effective , said mr @entity20 , clearly worried that the move may be seen as an attempt to conceal cuts in conventional weapons			1
however , he added : ‘ a man with a rifle is not state - of - the - art modern warfare			0
‘ a modern infantryman has more firepower than an entire platoon in @entity305 ’s army at @entity306			0
’ the cyber strike force was a further leap forward , he stressed			1
‘ looking at nations in terms of how many servicemen and women they have is completely bonkers			0
‘ it would tell you @entity315 is second most powerful nation on earth after @entity317 , and the @entity56 about number ten			0

@entity20 gives interview from @entity22 's top - secret @entity128 nuclear bunker
conventional weapons are to be replaced with cyber strike forces , he says
attack force being built in conjunction with @entity116 spy chiefs
but defence secretary admits conventional forces face cuts to pay for it
