a waitress has told how she feared for her life after hair dye triggered a horrific allergic reaction which left her unable to see for five days			1
@entity4 , 41 , had been colouring her hair for 20 years without any problems when she bought a kit ahead of a trip to visit her son on his @entity11 base			1
but hours after applying the @entity13 ’ @entity15 dye , her face had swelled up like a ‘ rugby ball ’ and became covered in weeping blisters , which doctors later compared to a fire victim ’s burns			1
@entity4 was rushed to hospital after her head swelled up so much that she was unable to see eventually she required hospital treatment to fight the reaction			1
now the hotel waitress has vowed never to colour her hair again and let it turn grey naturally			1
mrs @entity4 said : ‘ it was so terrifying that at one point i thought , “ this is it , it ’s over – i ’m going to die because of a hair colour			1
” ‘ it was agony			1
i thought i would be left blind if not worse			2
‘ it is n’t worth it			2
it was the most terrifying experience of my life – i never want to go through that again			2
’ mrs @entity4 decided to use the @entity13 dye , which she said she had used many times before , to cover up her grey hairs before visiting her 24 - year - old son @entity44 , a soldier based in @entity45			1
she said she followed the instructions on the packet , testing the dye on a patch of skin 48 hours before application , but experienced no reaction			1
however , within 20 minutes of using the dye on her hair , her head had started to itch			2
she said : ‘ it got worse and worse so i went to bed and tried to forget about it			2
when i woke up in the morning i was in agony			2
the itching was so intense and i could n’t open one eye			2
i looked in the mirror and my head was like a rugby ball			0
’ she developed a rash and weeping blisters broke out on her head			0
@entity4 suffered an allergic reaction after using @entity70 hair dye @entity71 , a 41 - year - old former soldier , initially took her to a doctor , who prescribed antihistamines to reduce the swelling			1
however , her symptoms became worse and both her eyes closed up due to the swelling			0
she added : ‘ my pillow was soaked in pus			0
it was running off my head and from behind my ears – it was disgusting			0
i could n’t even open my eyes			0
’ mrs @entity4 , from @entity85 , @entity86 , was taken to hospital where she was given steroid injections , antibiotics and antihistamines			1
doctors there compared her burns to those of fire victims			1
she was treated as an outpatient and returned home , hoping the medication would cure her as soon as possible			0
but it was several days before she was able to see again			0
when her condition began to improve she ‘ burst into tears of relief ’ not least because she had recovered her sight			0
‘ then i posted pictures on @entity105 to warn all my friends and family , ’ she said			0
‘ i ’ll never dye my hair again			0
’ a spokesman for @entity13 said : ‘ the safety of the people who use our products is our first and most important priority , so we ’re concerned to hear about this			0
‘ allergic reactions are very rare and hair colourants are extensively researched to ensure they are safe when used as directed			0
‘ millions of women safely and successfully use home hair colourants many times each year			0
’ after doctors prescribed a cocktail of steroid injections , antibiotics and anti-histamines , the swelling began to subside before the allergic reaction : @entity4 has now sworn off hair dye for life			1

@entity4 *'s* burns were compared to those of fire victims
waitress claims she *completed* a test patch before use with no reaction
six weeks later , she is still suffering from scabs and itchy skin
