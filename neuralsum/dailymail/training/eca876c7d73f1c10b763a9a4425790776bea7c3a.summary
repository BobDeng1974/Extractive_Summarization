defeat : @entity0 lost his @entity2 battle to have the miner 's union pay for the rent on his @entity7 flat for the rest of his life today the former miners ’ leader @entity0 has lost his fight to have the @entity12 pay the rent on his @entity7 flat for the rest of his life			1
mr @entity0 , 74 , had argued that he signed a contract which entitled him to a property throughout his retirement			1
but the union disputed the claim and took the decision all the way to the @entity2			0
and today mr @entity22 ruled in the @entity12 ' ( @entity12 ) favour stating that no such agreement had been made			1
after the ruling , @entity12 general secretary @entity25 said that it was ' regrettable ' that it had to bring the case against the 74 - year - old who was president for 20 years until july 2002			1
mr @entity0 said that the judgment was ' perverse ' and flew in the face of all the evidence			2
he said : ' there can be no doubt that 30 years ago i was given an entitlement to a property by the union and that entitlement continued during my retirement , as it had done for all my predecessors including @entity43 and , after he died , his widow @entity44			1
' asked if he will launch an appeal , he said : ' i shall talk to my lawyers about what the best course of action will be , but i think any independent observer will regard this as yet another judgment with the @entity54 feeling about it			0
' mr @entity0 has occupied the @entity57 apartment , rented from the @entity58 , since june 1982 - and the rent and associated expenses were paid by the union until 2011 , except for a period between 1985 and 1991 when he met them			2
the case was based on documents dating back 30 years and the identification of what terms were agreed between himself and duly authorised representatives of the @entity12 ' regrettable ' : general secretary of the miners ' union @entity25 indicated they had not wanted to bring the matter to court the judge rejected mr @entity0 ’s argument that having the union pay the rent on the flat was a replacement for the benefit given to his predecessors - who all had houses bought for them in or near @entity7 which they were entitled to occupy before and after retirement at a very low rent or very reduced purchased price - and therefore was also a lifetime benefit			1
he said the original minutes of the @entity89 ( @entity89 ) from 1982 did not say that and it was not in the original contract which mr @entity0 signed			2
when , in 1991 , mr @entity0 decided he did not want to take up the benefit of having a house bought for him but instead wanted the union to resume paying the flat rental , he should have gone back to the @entity89 and sought its authority , he added			0
instead , said the judge , mr @entity0 obtained on his own initiative , and without involving the @entity89 , legal advice which supported his right to have the union pay for the @entity57 flat and told the finance department to resume payments			0
battle : mr @entity0 said he will talk to his lawyers before deciding whether to appeal the decision by mr @entity22 ' although mr @entity0 claims otherwise , the process of drafting the contracts and obtaining the legal advice , which should have been on an arm ’s - length basis , was done entirely on his initiative and under his control			1
none of this was disclosed to the @entity89			0
' ' the legal advice was based on information provided by him which did not give the full picture ; and anyway it could not make up for the absence of @entity89 authorisation			0
' therefore , when mr @entity0 retired in 2002 , the contract which appeared to give him the right to have the union continue to pay the rent on the @entity57 flat was not effective because the @entity89 had never approved his having any such right			0
' the union also successfully disputed mr @entity0 ’s fuel allowance at his @entity134 home and payment for the preparation of his annual tax return - but not the cost of his security system in @entity141 .			0

claimed it was agreed with @entity12 30 years ago
mr @entity22 ruled against the *iconic* leader
@entity12 general secretary says it was ' regrettable ' they had to bring the case
