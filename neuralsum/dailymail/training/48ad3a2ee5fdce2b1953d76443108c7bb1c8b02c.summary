on june 3 1965 astronaut @entity3 became the first @entity4 to go on a spacewalk – which lasted 23 minutes			1
needless to say , it was quite an experience and flight control had difficulty persuading him to return to the craft			2
however , ground control were very aware that time was not on his side			2
if he 'd stayed out for too long the station tracking the craft from @entity36 would have lost contact - and darkness would have fallen			1
incredible footage of the landmark event has been uploaded to @entity25 with users awestruck by the images			0
when @entity3 eased himself out of @entity42 he was travelling at nearly 18,000mph , 178 miles above @entity43			1
he floated and maneuvered himself around the craft while logging 6,500 miles during his orbital stroll			1
@entity3 was attached to the spacecraft by a 25 - foot umbilical line and a 23 - foot tether line , both wrapped in gold tape to form one cord			1
the visor of his helmet is gold plated to protect him from the unfiltered rays of the sun and his suit was pressurised with oxygen			0
amazing : @entity3 was able to move around thanks to a nitrogen - powered gun rivalry : the @entity4 was beaten to it by @entity62 , who sent a cosmonaut on a spacewalk a few months previously he was attached to a hose that supplied the craft with air and was able to move around thanks to a small nitrogen - powered gun			1
@entity71 , however , was beaten to it by @entity62 , who sent @entity74 on a spacewalk on march 18 , 1965			0
it ’s widely accepted that the @entity4 spacewalk was a propaganda response to this			0
ten crews flew during the @entity82 missions , which took place between 1965 and 1966			0
they helped @entity71 get ready for moon landings			0
an incredible 134 aircraft and 26 ships were involved in recovering the craft when it eventually returned to @entity90 .			0
