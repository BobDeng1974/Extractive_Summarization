however , it came very close to ending up in a skip			0

spokesman @entity131 said : ‘ the life - size head , mounted on a polished slate base , was sitting on the hearth in a small local cottage in front of an imitation - coal gas fire			0
‘ when @entity35 first saw it , it was so hot that he could n’t pick it up , and he assumed it was a reproduction			2
on closer inspection , he realised he had something quite special on his hands			0
’ miss @entity145 said the head of the @entity2 department at the @entity126 confirmed the cat dated from the 26th dynasty			1
she added : ‘ @entity35 asked the family for some background , and amazingly they had no idea it was valuable and were about to throw it in the skip			2
