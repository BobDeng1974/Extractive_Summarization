by @entity0 this is the dramatic moment that a quiet residential street resembled a scene from @entity4 when this eerie cloud formation appeared			1
the 1996 blockbuster saw @entity7 team up with @entity8 to fight an alien invasion			2
in one of the sci - fi film 's best - known scenes , the alien spaceships appear for the first time by passing through the clouds - and the @entity17 skyline looked remarkably similar on tuesday evening , as the sun began to set behind a long line of clouds			1
he said : ' my dog @entity38 was barking like mad so i looked out the window and could n’t believe my eyes			0
' it was like a scene out of @entity4			0
@entity43 had just scored again but i did n’t care , i just had to run upstairs and get a better look			0
i ’ve never seen anything like it			0
' the @entity47 said the brooding skyline was caused by the contrast in light as the setting sun lit up one side of the cloud while there were showers on the other side photographer @entity33 said that he ' could n't believe his eyes ' upon witnessing the sight of the eerie cloud formation in skies above @entity17 a spokesperson for the @entity47 said : ' this is a bank of stratocumulus cloud which has been highlighted by the contrast in light between the setting sun illuminating one side , and the showers behind the cloud			1
' this is a totally normal cloud formation but has been made to look more dramatic by the light			2

setting sun behind cloud bank *results* in spectacular skyline above residential street in @entity17
moment appears *reminiscent* of 1996 sci - fi hit @entity4 starring @entity7 and @entity8
' i *'ve* never seen anything like it ' , *admits* *awestruck* photographer @entity33 , who took the amazing images
@entity47 *expert* reveals the scene , while normal , looks so dramatic *due* to contrasting light
