culinary cure ? it appears asparagus could have a vital role to play in combating @entity5 's looming diabetes crisis asparagus could be a powerful new culinary weapon in the fight against diabetes			1
scientists have found regular intake of the increasingly popular vegetable keeps blood sugar levels under control and boosts the body ’s production of insulin , the hormone that helps it to absorb glucose			1
@entity5 consumption of asparagus has soared in recent years to record levels of around 8,000 tonnes a year			1
as well as its delicate flavour , it now appears it could have a vital role to play in combating @entity5 ’s looming diabetes crisis			2
type two diabetes , which accounts for 90 per cent of all diabetes cases , is emerging as a major health burden			0
according to the charity @entity33 , at the current rate of increase , the numbers affected will rise from around 2.5 million to four million by 2025 and five million by 2030			0
more than a million people are already affected by the condition but do not realise they have it , perhaps because they do not recognise symptoms , such as fatigue , thirst , frequent urination , recurrent thrush and wounds that are slow to heal			0
left untreated , type two diabetes can raise the risk of heart attacks , blindness and amputation			0
but if doctors catch it early , it can be well controlled with diet and medication			0
once known as ‘ late onset ’ diabetes , since it only tended to strike from middle - age onwards , doctors are now beginning to see patients in their teens and twenties with the condition			0
fatty foods and unhealthy lifestyles have long been thought raise the risks			0
high doses of the asparagus extract had a significant effect on insulin production by the pancreas , the organ which releases the hormone into the bloodstream to see if asparagus could help , scientists at the @entity74 in @entity75 injected rats with chemicals to induce a diabetic state , with low levels of insulin and high blood sugar content			1
they then treated half with an extract from the asparagus plant and the other half with an established anti-diabetic drug , called glibenclamide			2
the rats were fed the asparagus extract in small or large doses every day for 28 days			1
blood tests were then carried out to measure changes in their diabetes			2
the results , published in the @entity96 , showed low levels of the asparagus suppressed blood sugar levels but did not improve insulin output			1
only high doses of the extract had a significant effect on insulin production by the pancreas , the organ which releases the hormone into the bloodstream			1
the findings support earlier studies highlighting the benefits of asparagus			2
one published in the @entity113 in 2006 showed asparagus triggered an 81 per cent increase in glucose uptake by the body ’s muscles and tissues			0
in a report on their findings the @entity74 researchers said : ‘ this study suggests asparagus extract exerts anti-diabetic effects			1

high doses of asparagus extract had a significant effect on insulin production in tests
@entity5 consumption of asparagus is at record levels of around 8,000 tonnes a year
