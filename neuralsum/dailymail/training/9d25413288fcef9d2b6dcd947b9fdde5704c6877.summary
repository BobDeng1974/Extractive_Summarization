two years as a frustrated spectator could soon end for @entity1 after the injury - plagued @entity3 flanker was last night drafted into the @entity5 squad for the first time since 2013			1
@entity1 has been promoted from the @entity7 as cover for @entity11 back row @entity9 , who is himself undergoing assessments by @entity14 ’s medical team on an ankle injury picked up in saturday ’s @entity17 defeat by @entity18			1
it is a rare piece of good news for @entity1 , 29 , and a reward for his endeavour where many might have given up			1
the @entity23 and @entity24 has suffered rotten luck throughout his career ; with neck , knee and shoulder problems restricting him to eight club appearances since the 2012 - 13 season			1
@entity1 is hoping to put an injury - plagued tenure behind him with his @entity5 return @entity1 ( centre ) crosses the line to score a try for the @entity40 in 2013 he is out of contract at @entity3 this summer and his future in @entity5 has been in doubt			1
the @entity45 club have insisted on a pay cut to reflect the player ’s injury record but this latest return to the international set - up could convince @entity1 to stay put			1
following an abrasive weekend of @entity52 action , @entity1 was last night joined in the squad at @entity54 by @entity55 lock @entity56			1
the uncapped forward will provide cover for @entity59 , who is expected to be sidelined for four weeks with a knee injury			1
@entity62 flanker @entity61 and @entity64 lock @entity63 will replace @entity1 and day in the @entity7 squad for friday night ’s fixture against @entity67 in @entity68			1
but there could yet be more additions to the senior @entity72 party over the coming days			0
updates on the fitness of @entity75 ( knee ) , @entity77 ( shoulder ) and @entity79 ( knee ) are expected this afternoon			2
the latter is a particular concern after he was seen leaving the @entity84 on sunday evening on crutches with his left knee strapped in a brace			2
@entity1 is out of contract at @entity3 in the summer and his @entity5 future had been in doubt @entity5 boss @entity14 faces an anxious wait to find out if he needs to add other players to his squad ‘ it ’s too early to give any definitive news on their fitness , ’ said @entity14			1
‘ @entity1 ’s ankle and @entity79 ’s knee have been scanned			1
@entity79 sees a specialist and we will then be able to provide an update on him and the other injured players , along with any other potential additions to the squad			2
’ with @entity5 already short on centres , including the notable absence of @entity108 , @entity14 is confident midfield powerhouse @entity110 will be back training on friday			2
but @entity113 flanker @entity112 will play no part in this year ’s @entity116 plans after he was ruled out for the remainder of the season yesterday morning			0
the 25 - year - old will undergo surgery on a back problem this afternoon , as confirmed by @entity122			0
the @entity113 director of rugby said : ‘ it ’s obviously disappointing for @entity112 and for us			0
but it ’s obviously in everybody ’s interest to sort out these issues once and for all			0
@entity112 is only 25 and he has plenty of great rugby in him , for club and country			0
’ while clubs enjoy a rest period from the @entity141 , directors of rugby across the country will turn their focus to recruitment for the 2015/16 season			0
@entity145 understands that @entity146 are looking at @entity149 scrum half @entity147 as a potential marquee signing and they will keep a close eye on the no 9 when he plays for the @entity153 in a friendly match against @entity113 on saturday			0
@entity79 will have a scan on a knee problem and will also visit a specialist about it @entity147 ( right ) has been linked with a move to @entity146 they are not yet able to enter discussions with the 26 - year - old because of his contractual agreement to @entity164			2
it is understood @entity146 will face stiff competition from clubs in @entity168 and @entity169			0
the 27 - cap international is one of his country ’s highest - profile sportsmen and dated @entity173 , the murdered ex- girlfriend of @entity174			0
scrum - half reinforcements are high on the shopping list of @entity146 director of rugby @entity177 , who lost out to @entity64 in the battle to sign @entity181 9 @entity180			0
@entity147 can also play on the wing and scored the 2014 @entity184 try of the year in the 27 - 25 victory over @entity186 during the @entity187 .			0

@entity1 called up to the @entity5 squad for the first time in 2013
