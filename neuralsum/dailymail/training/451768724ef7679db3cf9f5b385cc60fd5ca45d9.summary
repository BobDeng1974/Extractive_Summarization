one of his daughters @entity92 went on to become a famous librarian to @entity95 in @entity96			0
her skin was light - both mr @entity2 and his wife had mixed heritages - so she pretended she was from a white background and added ' @entity101 ' to her name to give the impression of @entity105 ancestry , as well as changing @entity2 to @entity106			0
