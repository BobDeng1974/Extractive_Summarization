by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 _ @entity2 can be a future @entity3 captain , according to former defender @entity4			1
the £ 20million summer signing from @entity5 was considered one of the best centre backs in the @entity8 last season before he picked up an ankle injury			1
and @entity10 columnist @entity4 believes that @entity2 could replace @entity11 as captain when the @entity13 eventually hangs up his boots			2
' i think if @entity2 establishes himself in the team became a top player by showing the same form he has at @entity5 for @entity3 , then in the next few years when @entity31 does decide to call it day he will be in contention			1
' you look at him and he has the potential to make a big powerful impact at the back and that ’s what @entity3 need			0
’ strong at the back : @entity2 had a good season for @entity5 before picking up an injury ' @entity43 is another who could possibly be in contention and there will be more who arrive in that time that could be up for it as well			2
' but if @entity2 can come in and produce that sort of form then i am sure he will be in the running for it			0
' and @entity4 believes that @entity55 has pulled off a transfer coup by signing the defender who made a number of impressive performances last season			2
leading the way : @entity4 says @entity2 could replace @entity11 as captain he added : ‘ i saw him at @entity21 when @entity5 travelled there and i saw him against @entity63 as well and he was outstanding in both games			1
' he got the winner at @entity21 – i remember that well			0
' but he looks like an organiser and he looks like a leader			0
’ ' he did suffer with a few injury problems in the second - half of the campaign and that coincided with @entity5 tailing off a touch but definitely in the first - half he was playing as well as anybody in his position			0

@entity2 *joined* @entity3 from @entity5 for £ 20m
defender had an impressive season in the @entity8 for @entity5
@entity4 says @entity2 is a *natural* leader and could be captain one day
