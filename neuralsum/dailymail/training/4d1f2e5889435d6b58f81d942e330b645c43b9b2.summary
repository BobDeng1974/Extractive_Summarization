from revolvers to cricket stumps and matchboxes to watches , you ’re unlikely to see these sorts of camera models in your local technology store			2
dating back as far as 150 years , they are history ’s most unusual photographic devices - with some even designed for concealed use by detectives			2
among the most interesting is the @entity13 's @entity12 from 1862 - with a brass cylinder as the camera body , holding a circular glass plate			1
it was held like a rifle and aimed through a conventional gun sight believed to have taken its inspiration from the @entity18 , after each exposure the back of the cylinder was rotated through 90 degrees			1
four successive ‘ shots ’ could be taken in this before a ‘ reload ’ was required – but the camera was not a big success , with fewer than 100 produced			1
two decades later brought the launch of the @entity37 and @entity23 , which was held like a rifle and aimed through a conventional gun sight			1
around this time in the 1880s it was becoming popular for cameras resembling other objects to be built - either for secret photography or novelty value			2
other unusual cameras in the collection - compiled by the @entity47 in @entity48 - include a more modern one fitted inside stumps			1
snaps : the stumps camera from 1993 held two tiny cameras for cricket viewers ( left ) , while the 1949 @entity55 is seen ( right ) to be concealed : other hidden cameras include @entity58 's @entity57 from 1891 , which was designed to be worn underneath a waistcoat this device from 1993 followed the development five years earlier of the charge - coupled device sensor chip , to replace fragile camera tubes			1
this technology meant cameras could become smaller or remain the same size with better quality – and the stumps had two tiny cameras built in			0
this gave slightly different angles of view and allowed television viewers of cricket matches to experience the batsman ’s view of the action			0
another fascinating device is the @entity79 - a miniature camera housed inside a metal case , the size of a normal matchbox			1
it was designed to be disguised as a box of matches by sliding inside a match box cover , and used by @entity89 spies during the @entity90			2
other hidden cameras include @entity58 's @entity57 from 1891 , which was designed to be worn underneath the photographer 's waistcoat			1
early days : in 1906 , the @entity94 was launched , which carried rollfilm that was contained in a special cardboard drop - in cartridge different ages : the 2.5 - inch @entity99 from 1935 ( left ) and the @entity101 camera from 1970 , designed for children ( right ) and in 1885 we saw the @entity104 - priced at five shillings when first released , and designed to be hidden within clothing			2
an advert said : ‘ no movement is too rapid for it – the racehorse at greatest speed , the flight of birds , even the lightning flash itself ’			0
@entity119 , curator of photographic technology at the @entity47 , told @entity121 : ‘ from the 1880s , with the introduction of dry plate photography , cameras became more portable and could be held in the hand to take pictures			2
‘ this quickly led to cameras being designed , or disguised , to look like other objects			0
‘ since then , hidden and unusually - shaped cameras have regularly appeared , with varying degrees of popularity			0
’ other interesting models include the @entity55 , designed in @entity132 in 1949 in the shape of a wristwatch so it could be worn			1
more than 40 years earlier , the @entity94 was launched , which carried rollfilm that was contained in a special cardboard drop - in cartridge			0
festive : the @entity140 camera was launched in 1980 , a century after the @entity104 , designed to be hidden within clothing used in @entity90 : the @entity79 - a miniature camera housed inside a metal case , which was the size of a normal matchbox the lens , carried in the winding stem , was covered by a screw - on cap between exposures – and a clip - on viewfinder was available as an add - on			1
also in the selection are the @entity153 from 1980 and the @entity155 camera from 1970 , which was designed for use by children			0
the @entity158 was made in the @entity159 from about 1970 under licence from @entity161 and incorporates a 126 cartridge camera			0
for indoor shots , a flash cube can be plugged into the top of @entity167 ’s head – and publicity claimed it had everything for ‘ perfect pictures , every time ’			0
meanwhile , the @entity140 camera had a viewfinder on his forehead , a shutter release on his cap and a film advance dial running across his left cheek			0
mr @entity119 said : ‘ the back carries a label with a useful piece of advice that all photographers should consider - “ remove nose when taking pictures ”			0

among collection is @entity13 's @entity12 ( 1862 ) - four ' shots ' in a *row* could be taken before ' reload '
@entity190 two decades later was held like rifle and aimed through conventional gun sights
collection compiled by @entity47 in @entity48 also includes matchbox camera used during @entity90
others are @entity58 's @entity57 ( 1891 ) worn underneath waistcoat and @entity55 ( 1949 )
