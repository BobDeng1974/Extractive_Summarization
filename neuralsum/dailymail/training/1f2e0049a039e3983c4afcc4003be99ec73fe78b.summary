by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity3 manager @entity2 revealed two players had refused to take the first penalty after their shootout defeat by @entity7 on wednesday			1

afterwards , @entity28 - who takes over at @entity29 next week - appeared to suggest that two players refused to take kicks but would n't elaborate			2
he said : ' you need to score the first one and i asked two players to take the first ball before ending up with @entity12			1
' i thought he was the best player on the pitch so should have a lot of confidence			0
it just goes to show it 's not easy scoring in a penalty shoot - out			2
acrobatic : @entity7 goalkeeper @entity19 saves a penalty from midfielder @entity15 ' it 's a very humiliating question to be asked who the players were			1
' a tight game ended scoreless after 120 minutes but @entity7 went through after scoring with four consecutive spot - kicks			1
@entity28 was n't able to send specialist goalkeeper @entity50 on in goal for the penalties as he did last week as he had already used three substitutes			0
to add to his pain , @entity7 goalkeeper @entity19 once played for him at @entity55			1
' we did n't lose against them , but the penalties are down to luck , ' he added			0
' i taught @entity19 how to stop penalties , so that hurts			0
' match winner : @entity7 keeper @entity19 celebrates at the end of the shootout , in which he made two saves @entity69 's @entity68 scored one of @entity7 's penalties after returning from injury as a substitute			1
he is now expected to start on sunday			2
coach @entity74 must now prepare for @entity26 and said : ' @entity26 are always a very difficult hurdle to overcome			2
' it 'll be difficult playing them , and it 's an additional hurdle that they 've had the extra day and , indeed , could rein themselves in for the second half against @entity82			0
' contrasting emotions : @entity3 goalkeeper @entity84 buries his head in his hands as @entity7 celebrate in the background @entity3 , meanwhile , will face @entity82 in a third - placed play - off game on saturday , @entity28 's last game before being unveiled at @entity29 next week			1
' i think this match should never be played , ' said @entity28			0
' i 've been saying that for 10 years			0
' if you lose twice in a row and you look back on a tournament where you 've played so marvellously but you leave as a loser after losing the last two matches			0
