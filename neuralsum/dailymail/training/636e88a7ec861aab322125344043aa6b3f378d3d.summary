an octopus floored a wasp			0
a wolf kicked off a melee			0
the @entity4 never fails to deliver , and friday night was no different			0
the real serious entertainment was left to the mavericks at the @entity7 as south @entity8 romped home to clinch victory			1
but that 's only half the story			2
having a ball : the mascots pose for a photo ahead of the @entity4 at the @entity7 raucous : there was mayhem as the mascots piled on top of each other with @entity22 the @entity23 looking on down and out : the octopus lies on the field as some of the other mascots pose for the cameras the 17 representatives were split into two teams - north and south of the capital - and ended up crashing into each other as the obstacle course was left in tatters			1
with the competition descending into farce - there did n't appear any clear leader - @entity40 ' wolf seized his moment			2
off he went , making a beeline for @entity46 's @entity45 , and putting his rival down on the floor			2
@entity51 's wyvern waded in , with ' @entity52 ' igniting a pile - on that had supporters in stitches			1
and it 's a good job			2
@entity57 had dawdled along to 117 - 7 , heavily indebted to a late dart by @entity59 , as @entity60 strangled the life out of their rivals before the interval in the @entity64			1
let the race begin : @entity67 's @entity66 negotiates the tricky obstacle course on the field at the @entity7 on the run : the @entity60 lion makes his move as his counterparts look on in the background taking a breather : @entity79 mascot @entity77 the @entity77 sits down for a rest after the race ready for action : @entity46 mascots @entity84 ( left ) and @entity45 arrive at the ground the 15,000 - strong crowd were treated to what was a drama - filled relay race involving excitable football , cricket and rugby union mascots			1
there was definite nervous tension in the air beforehand ; some chose to down as much water as possible			0
others - @entity98 's badger - decided his replenishment just had to be alcoholic			2
the beers flowed during the @entity57 innings and there was no stopping @entity22			0
away he danced , enthusiastically cajoling the crowd before the play fight broke out			0
big race : @entity107 ' @entity106 and @entity109 's wolf hold up the @entity111 finish tape piles of fun : bubbles the @entity46 bear gets up to mischief as he jumps on the @entity40 wolf bodies lay strewn on the pitch , some pride had been battered			1
@entity123 's pair @entity121 and @entity124 watched on while @entity125 , @entity67 and a rather fiery @entity127 cock all threw themselves into the hilariously mismanaged bundle that spiralled out of control			0
@entity60 's lion was n't interested in all that though			1
maybe oblivious to what was going on , maybe just that competitive , he strode to the finish line and won it for south @entity8			1
but what about the wolf ? he wandered off triumphantly with two arms raised			0
saracens have a good one there			0
all smiles : chirpy the @entity127 cockerel waves for the camera as he walks around the field grooving : @entity148 ' entrant shows off some dance moves in front of the crowd the @entity64 continues at the @entity7 when @entity60 take on @entity152 â€“ next friday june 6th			1

@entity60 's lion strode to the finish line to *win* it for @entity8
