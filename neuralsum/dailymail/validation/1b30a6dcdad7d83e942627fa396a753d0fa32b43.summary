saucy : the @entity2 poster that led to the apology it 's the cheeky poster that adorned the bedroom walls of countless teenage boys in the 1970s and 1980s			1
whether @entity2 's tennis girl is a suitable adornment for the genteel surrounds of the @entity9 is another matter entirely			1
following a volley of criticism and cries of sexism on social media , the @entity11 was forced to apologise for using the iconic poster to promote a forthcoming exhibition			1
earlier yesterday they had tweeted a photograph of the dress worn by the blonde model and her racket , alongside the famous image , to promote its @entity26 exhibition , due to open tomorrow			1
that such a saucy shot should appear to have won the approval of the historic and respectable club immediately raised eyebrows on @entity31			2
tennis fan @entity32 was outraged , writing : ' ca n't believe @entity33 used this pic for upcoming ' @entity35 '			0
' @entity37 fans who call themselves ' @entity38 ' on @entity31 , posted : ' come on @entity39 ! i thought you were the classy slam ! ' the offending image was swiftly deleted from the official @entity31 account and a new post went up which said : ' we apologise for offence caused by the @entity48 poster			1
it is a controversial piece of poster history but we do not endorse it			0
' the @entity11 used the iconic poster to promote a forthcoming exhibition however , a @entity31 user responded with the comment : ' the poster does n't show the history of tennis , the girl is n't a tennis player , you are just publicising sexualisation of females			1
' and campaign group the @entity65 asked : ' @entity33 having deleted your tweet , can you confirm if the poster you tweeted will be included in your exhibition ? ' last night an @entity11 spokesman said the poster would remain in the exhibition despite the apology			2
he added : ' we 're aware that the poster has generated debate on social media and we decided to respond to some of the comments raised since we want to be clear that it is not a reflection of how we view women in tennis			1
' the image in question is from a 1970s poster that was extremely popular , selling over 2million copies worldwide and it is part of an historic exhibition about tennis posters dating back to 1893			2
' not to include it in the exhibition would perhaps be an oversight since it is the most famous tennis poster of all time and should be regarded in this context only			0
' use of the saucy shot on the official @entity31 page immediately raised eyebrows on @entity31 last night tennis fans were questioning whether the poster , one of the world 's best - selling , really is that controversial after all			1
one @entity31 user said : ' come on @entity39 ! i thought you were the classy slam ! ' @entity107 tweeted : ' @entity33 are getting stick for sharing iconic poster			2
political correctness gone mad / do n't pretend you 've never seen it before ! ' @entity112 posted : ' @entity33 [ has ] nothing to apologise for â€“ i think it 's a great poster , is of its time in history			0
' @entity116 said : ' @entity33 has just tweeted an apology for any ' offence ' caused by a link to the 40 - year - old @entity121 poster			0
the world 's gone mad			0
' others merely saw the funny side			0
' i think @entity33 were right to delete the @entity2 poster tweet , ' one @entity31 user wrote			2
' no one should have to see that appalling 1970s court surface again			0
' the year - long exhibition will range from the earliest poster in the museum 's collection , an 1893 advertisement for @entity135 , through to the original artwork for this year 's @entity137 at the world famous venue in @entity140 .			0
