listening to @entity0 can significantly help to focus the mind and improve brain performance , according to new research			1
a study found that listening to a minuet - a specific style of classical dance music - composed by @entity0 increased the ability of both young and elderly people to concentrate and complete a task			1
scientists say that the findings help to prove that music plays a crucial role in human brain development			1
are @entity16 the ultimate study aid ? @entity19 and @entity20 scientists have discovered that @entity0 's harmonious melodies help to focus the mind and prevent distraction when carrying out a task ‘ music evolved for helping to overcome the predicament of stress that arises from holding contradictory cognitions so that knowledge is not discarded but rather can be accumulated , and human culture can evolve , ' wrote professor @entity31 of @entity19 ’s @entity32 and dr @entity33 of @entity34 , who led the research			1
researchers took 25 boys , aged between eight and nine as well as 25 older people aged between ages 65 to 75 , and made them complete a version of a @entity42 task			0
the @entity42 task is a famous test used to investigate a person 's mental performance and involves asking the participant to identify the colour of words			2
the challenge is managing to identify the correct colour when the word spells out a different colour			0
many have described the benefits that the composer 's music has on the brain as the ' @entity58 ' as the series of words flash before the participants on a computer screen , they must identify each colour and ignore the word that the letters spell out			1
for example , the word ‘ red ’ could be written in the colour blue but the participant must say the word ' red '			0
the test was carried out three times			0
once while a @entity0 minuet played in the background , once with a modified version of the same music with dissonant ( irregular and unpleasant ) intervals , and a third time in complete silence			2
the findings were consistent for both the younger and older participants			0
both age groups were able to identify the correct colours quicker and with less errors when listening to the original @entity0 music			2
when dissonant music played , reaction times became significantly slower and there was a much higher rate or mistakes			0
scientists said that the brain ’s natural dislike of dissonant music and the high success rate of the flowing , consonant ( harmonious ) music of @entity0 indicate the important effect of music on cognitive function			1
it also showed that consonant music could help come people ignore distractions , they added			0
@entity0 's is universally described as complex , melodically beautiful and rich in harmony and texture			2
the @entity105 composer , keyboard player , violinist , violist , and conductor died at the age of 35 , and left behind more than 600 pieces			0
previous studies have found that his compositions provide cognitive benefits and scientists have referred to this as the ' @entity58 ' .			1

scientists have discovered that listening to @entity0 is better than listening to less flowing music or silence when trying to focus on a task
say that findings prove that music plays crucial role in brain development
previous studies have found that the composer 's pieces have a beneficial effect on the brain which as been termed at the ' @entity58 '
