by @entity0 2013 was a turbulent year for @entity1			0
the @entity4 president 's country has veered from crisis to crisis - with unemployment hitting 3.29million in december and the economy falling by 0.1 per cent in the third quarter of this year			2
mr @entity1 's proposal to introduce a top tax rate of 75 per cent has seen thousands taking to the streets in protest and - perhaps most damning of all - in recent polls he was slammed as the most unpopular presidents in recent history			2
and , if these pictures are anything to go by , it would seem mr @entity1 's lack of popularity has spread from his people to those in the public eye			0
a series of amusing photographs - all of which appear to show mr @entity1 's handshakes being snubbed by a series of world leaders - have gone viral online			1
