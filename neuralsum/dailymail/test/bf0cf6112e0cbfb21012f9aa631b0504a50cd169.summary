four genuine @entity1 heavyweights remain in the @entity2 , a quartet steeped in history and silverware			2
between @entity7 , @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10 , the big - eared trophy has been lifted 21 times			1
any of those clubs would be deserving finalists in the @entity14 in @entity15 on june 6			0
but for tension , intrigue , and the potential for high drama , the match - up that most appeals has to be @entity7 versus @entity9			1
@entity23 's late winner against @entity24 sent @entity7 into the @entity2 semis @entity26 scored both goals in the second leg as @entity9 beat @entity29 5 - 1 on aggregate transporting @entity31 to east @entity32 would bring a defining chapter to a myriad narratives , raising @entity36 ’s grandest derby to a level not seen amid years of ebb and flow between the two @entity40 behemoths			1
we have seen plenty of tangles in recent years , notably the @entity2 semi-final of 2011 , and some may insist the unseemly battles when the pair faced off 12 times in 19 months a couple of years ago became too much			0
but never have they duelled in the continent 's largest match			0
that would crystalise their competition			0
it would be a fascinating game			0
@entity57 is looking for his third @entity2 trophy and second in a row with @entity7 @entity9 's formidable front three of @entity60 ( left ) , @entity26 ( centre ) and @entity62 ( right ) they have only met twice this season , both times in @entity65			1
@entity7 won 3 - 1 at the @entity66 before @entity67 before @entity9 's 2 - 1 win at the @entity69 last month , so the appetite is not sated this campaign			1
a deciding third bout at @entity36 ’s main event would draw global crowds not witnessed before			0
just think : @entity57 and @entity62 , the pre-eminent practitioners of this era , head - to - head for the biggest club prize of all			2
the @entity80 v the @entity81 , @entity83 ’s athletic might against @entity85 ’s diminutive delight , the current @entity87 holder against the man who won four consecutively			0
@entity9 won 3 - 1 on aggregate when the sides met in the semi-finals of the 2011 @entity2 @entity92 scored the winner when @entity7 beat @entity9 in the 2014 @entity95 final @entity92 celebrates at the @entity96 after scoring a wonder goal that won the @entity95 for @entity9 @entity98 could come up against his former team @entity9 after guiding @entity8 into the last four then there 's the undercard fights for supremacy : @entity92 , the world ’s most expensive signing on paper , vying with @entity26 , the game ’s costliest player when all told ; @entity107 , that deadly @entity108 , versus @entity60 , the indefatigable @entity109 ( both tied on six @entity2 goals this season , by the way )			1
both teams have a trident attack to strike fear into their opponents			0
whose will triumph on the biggest stage ? it is an intriguing question to pose			0
then we have @entity122 trying to save his job by going for his fourth @entity2 as a manager , against @entity125 , who has weathered a storm in his debut season to break the record for number of club wins ( 42 ) in a head coach 's first 50 games			2
as a player he won @entity65 with both @entity7 and @entity9 but never the @entity2			1
@entity62 and @entity57 have had many duels , and could have another one this season in the @entity2 @entity136 heads home during @entity7 's 3 - 1 win over @entity9 in the @entity31 at the @entity66 in october @entity60 scored what proved to be the winner when @entity9 won the @entity65 meeting in march @entity98 facing his old club , the place he delivered dream football and two @entity145 , would be tantalising – be we can have that in the semi-final			1
he needs to visit the @entity69 as an opposition manager			0
that would leave @entity7 vs @entity10 in the other last - four match			2
two teams with plenty of shared history , not least the 1998 @entity2 final when the @entity157 side ’s @entity155 , now a @entity7 coach , was denied by @entity160 ’s goal			1
yes , @entity7 vs @entity9 on a june evening in @entity15 would capture imaginations and invite the world to watch			2
mar 22 , 2015 - @entity65 , @entity9 2 - 1 @entity7 oct 25 , 2014 - @entity65 , @entity7 3 - 1 @entity9 apr 16 , 2014 - @entity95 , @entity9 1 - 2 @entity7 mar 23 , 2014 - @entity65 , @entity7 3 - 4 @entity9 oct 26 , 2013 - @entity65 , @entity9 2 - 1 @entity7 mar 2 , 2013 - @entity65 , @entity7 2 - 1 @entity9 feb 26 , 2013 - @entity95 , @entity9 1 - 3 @entity7 jan 30 , 2013 - @entity95 , @entity7 1 - 1 @entity9 oct 7 , 2012 - @entity65 , @entity9 2 - 2 @entity7 aug 29 , 2012 - @entity163 , @entity7 2 - 1 @entity9 aug 23 , 2012 - @entity163 , @entity9 3 - 2 @entity7 apr 21 , 2012 - @entity65 , @entity9 1 - 2 @entity7 jan 25 , 2012 - @entity95 , @entity9 2 - 2 @entity7 jan 18 , 2012 - @entity95 , @entity7 1 - 2 @entity9 dec 10 , 2011 - @entity65 , @entity7 1 - 3 @entity9 aug 17 , 2011 - @entity163 , @entity9 3 - 2 @entity7 aug 14 , 2011 - @entity163 , @entity7 2 - 2 @entity9 may 3 , 2011 - @entity2 , @entity9 1 - 1 @entity7 apr 27 , 2011 - @entity2 , @entity7 0 - 2 @entity9 apr 20 , 2011 - @entity95 , @entity9 0 - 1 @entity7 apr 16 , 2011 - @entity65 , @entity7 1 - 1 @entity9 nov 29 , 2010 - @entity65 , @entity9 5 - 0 @entity7			1

@entity9 , @entity8 , @entity10 and @entity7 make up last four
@entity7 looking for their 11th title and to retain their crown
@entity9 have won three champions @entity169 since 2006
the two @entity40 giants have never met in the @entity2 final
their meetings this season have resulted in one win *apiece*
who will win the @entity2 ? our *reporters* have their say
@entity57 , @entity62 and @entity185 battle to be *top* scorer
