communities secretary @entity0 said speaking @entity1 is crucial to allow us to come together and be part of @entity5 society supermarket workers are to be given badges to identify them as immigrant - friendly so they can be approached by those who want to practise their @entity1			1
under a bizarre scheme to be launched today , checkout staff at @entity12 and the co-op will be employed as ‘ sympathetic listeners ’ so those with poor @entity1 can brush up their language skills			1
more than £ 6million of public money will be spent on new projects to coax those who do n’t speak @entity1 to finally learn the language			2
announcing the plans , communities secretary @entity0 warned that those who fail to speak @entity1 ‘ are condemned to a limited life ’			1
recent census figures showed that across @entity27 1.7 per cent of the population - more than a million people - have either no , or poor spoken @entity1			2
that figure rises to 9 per cent in some @entity30 boroughs where one in three inhabitants was born abroad			0
under the plans , language classes will be held in mosques , churches and @entity38 gurdwaras in order to reach those people who have not got access to language training			1
language classes will be focused on practical themes , rather than classroom @entity1 , so immigrants can learn how to engage with schools , hospitals and other public services and how to discuss social activities such as cooking and gardening			1
those who are struggling will also be encouraged to help design their own courses and local volunteers will be recruited to hold informal conversations with those who a struggling			0
a source at the @entity59 said : ‘ training staff in supermarkets to be ‘ sympathetic listeners ’ to encourage learners to practise their @entity1 in - store - badges will make trained listeners easily identifiable			1
’ that project will get the go ahead in outlets of @entity12 and @entity68 in @entity69 and @entity70			2
there will also be new language projects in @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 and @entity82			0
in @entity30 15 boroughs will be targeted : @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity98 and @entity99			0
help : staff will help people practise their @entity1 at outlets of @entity12 and coop in @entity69 and @entity70 the projects were selected after ministers were told that traditional @entity1 language classes are not always suited to the people who need them the most - such as those who are often socially and economically isolated by their lack of @entity1			1
mr @entity0 said : ‘ speaking @entity1 is crucial to allow us to come together and be part of @entity5 society			1
people are unable to do this and are condemned to a limited life if they ca n’t speak our language			0
‘ to be a proper functioning citizen you must be able to speak @entity1			2
those who ca n’t are missing out much of @entity5 society , such as participating in civic life , talking to neighbours , or popping to the shops			0
‘ these fantastic projects will have a positive impact on local communities , enabling people to fulfil their potential , to communicate with friends and neighbours , gain employment and increase self - confidence			0
’ mr @entity0 hopes that investing in new ways of improving language skills will also lead to reduced translation and interpretation costs for local public services - money which he believes could be better directed at services that will benefit all residents and communities			2
he added : ‘ far too much taxpayers money has been wasted by councils on translation services , reducing the motivation to learn @entity1 and leaving too many people isolated at home and unable to get on			0
‘ we want to give more people the opportunities to participate fully in their communities , without being held back because they ca n’t speak the language			0
