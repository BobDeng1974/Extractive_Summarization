men born abroad have been more likely to hold down a job since the financial crisis than those born in @entity5 , an international think - tank has found			1
despite a drop in overall employment during the economic downturn , male migrants in the @entity5 have had higher levels of employment than ‘ native - born men ’			1
before 2007 , foreign men were less likely to be in a job than those born in this country			0
the @entity17 's @entity18 has shown how foreign - born men have had higher levels of employment than @entity5 - born workers since 2007 while @entity5 workers have seen employment rates fall since 2001 , male migrants workers have seen an increase in the number in work ( file picture ) but analysis by the @entity17 , which represents the world ’s leading industrialised nations , has found that since then foreign - born workers have been better at keeping their jobs			1
critics of immigration policies say the report shows @entity5 have not benefited from economic growth over previous years			2
but others say migrants are , in many cases , simply more hard - working			0
the @entity17 study found that in 2006 , before the economic crisis , 76.9 per cent of @entity5 - born men were in a job – ahead of 76.3 per cent of those born abroad			1
but by 2008 , the figures had flipped , with a 76.8 per cent employment rate for @entity5 - born men compared with 77.8 per cent for those born abroad			1
the report suggests ' foreign - born ' men have reversed a pre-crisis shortfall and are now doing better than men who were born in the country			2
file picture shows migrants workers in a field at a farm in @entity56 the 2012 figures show the gap is now even wider with 74.3 per cent employment for men born in the @entity5 compared with 76.9 per cent for foreign - born men			1
for women , however , those born in the @entity5 are still more likely to be in employment than those born elsewhere			2
sir @entity65 , chairman of @entity66 , said : ‘ it is time for the thorough assessment of the impact of immigration on the employment of @entity5 workers that this report only touches on			2
’ the unemployment rate now stands at 7.8 per cent , according to the latest figures from the @entity76 the findings feature in the @entity80 - based think - tank ’s @entity18 report for 2013 , which also reveals that in 2011 total permanent immigration rose in 34 @entity17 countries , from 2010			1
the report also found the @entity5 and @entity84 are the biggest recipients of migrants from areas most affected by the financial crisis , particularly southern @entity89 , with numbers almost doubling in recent years			1
it concluded the take - up of benefits by immigrants relative to native - born households in the @entity5 is lower than the average in @entity17 countries			1
@entity99 , director of migrants ’ @entity98 , said : ‘ with a high level of male migrant participation rates in economic activity and an upward trend in earning levels the evidence shows migration is a dynamic and positive feature of modern economies and ought to be acknowledged as such			2
’ the latest figures from the @entity76 show the total number of people unemployed between february and april 2013 was 2.51 million			0
the @entity17 report suggests while the employment rates of @entity5 - born men has fallen from 78.14 per cent in 2001 to 74.73 per cent in 2012 , male migrant workers have seen an increase from 72.3 per cent to 76.9 per cent			1
while the @entity5 has seen a drop overall in employment since the financial crisis , male migrants have had higher levels than ' native - born ' men ( file picture ) a @entity124 spokesman said half of those @entity5 residents who were foreign - born , as defined in the report , were now @entity5 citizens			1
she said : ' the official figures show that the recent rise in employment has benefited @entity5 citizens first but that we continue attracting skilled migrants to the @entity5 where they are needed by @entity5 businesses			1
' we are building an immigration system that works in the national interest and is supporting growth			0
' our reforms are working , and they are having an impact in all the right places			0
we have tightened immigration routes where abuse was rife and net migration is down by almost a third as a result			0
' we will continue to work hard to ensure that net migration is reduced from the hundreds of thousands to the tens of thousands by the end of this @entity148			0
' the report also found that the @entity5 and @entity84 are the biggest recipients of migrants fleeing countries most affected by the financial crisis , particular in southern @entity89 , with numbers almost doubling in recent years			1
it added that outflows of nationals from these countries are speeding up , with movements having risen by 45 per cent from 2009 to 2011 and early data suggests this increase is continuing			0
dr @entity161 , senior researcher at the @entity162 at the @entity163 , said : ' the @entity17 data on labour markets make very interesting reading			0
' it is important to recognise that migrants are not one homogenous group , and that different sorts of migrants have been affected differently by the economic downturn			0
the report found that the @entity5 and @entity84 were the biggest recipients of migrants fleeing countries most affected by the financial crisis ( file picture ) ' two things stand out , the first is that there is a big gender difference - foreign - born men have seen less of a decline in their employment rate than @entity5 born men between 2008 and 2012 , but the employment rate of foreign - born women has seen a bigger decline than that of @entity5 - born women in the same period			1
' looking at @entity189 and @entity190 , which will see access restrictions to the @entity5 labour market lifted at the end of this year , the report draws a number of conclusions			2
in @entity189 , the @entity17 said migration data is limited with officially registered emigration likely to capture only a small fraction of outflows			0
this is significant because there has been a prolonged debate in the @entity5 over providing estimates of the numbers of @entity204 likely to arrive in the @entity5 next year			0
' it is time for a thorough assessment of the impact of immigration on the employment of @entity5 workers that this report only touches on ' - sir @entity65 , chairman of campaign group @entity66 @entity5 the @entity213 has so far refused to provide official estimates as ministers believe they would not be reliable			2
earlier this week the @entity216 reported how @entity5 was the first choice for young @entity204 who want to work abroad			0
@entity218 revealed a quarter of the population aged between 18 and 35 would choose a job in the @entity5 when work restrictions for @entity204 and @entity190 are removed on january 1			0
the study found that @entity5 had overtaken @entity84 as the most popular destination for young @entity204 wanting to emigrate			2
in @entity190 , the @entity17 pointed to a @entity225 study which found that 12 per cent of @entity190 surveyed planned to emigrate one restrictions on free movement to the @entity228 were lifted			0
this is the equivalent of 876,000 of the population			0
looking at the education sector , the report also found that the @entity5 is one of six countries where international students are over-represented among the universities and other higher education institutions when compared to the number of foreign - born persons in the population			1
but the report concluded that the take - up of social benefits by immigrants relative to native - born households in the @entity5 is lower than the average seen in all @entity17 countries , across all types of benefits .			1

higher percentage of male migrants in work than @entity5 men since 2007
employment rates have dropped overall , but male migrants now doing better
figures feature in the @entity17 's *420* - page @entity259
report also found that the @entity5 and @entity84 are the biggest recipients of migrants fleeing countries most affected by the financial crisis
