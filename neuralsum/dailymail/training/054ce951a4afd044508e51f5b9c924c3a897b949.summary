by @entity0 @entity1 shift their @entity3 preparations up another gear on wednesday night as they take on @entity5 at @entity7 's @entity6			1
it 's the first of two warm - up friendlies @entity11 's team will play there this week , with @entity13 to follow on saturday			1
here 's our lowdown on the @entity5 team that will line - up against @entity1			1
line - up : @entity5 pose for a team photograph ahead of their @entity3 qualifier with @entity21 in @entity22 match details the match kicks - off at 8pm @entity26 time ( 3pm @entity7 time ) and will be screened live on @entity27			1
there will be a live blog on @entity30 if you 're not near a tv			0
it is at the @entity6 , home of the @entity36 @entity35 team and former home of the @entity39 baseball team			2
it has hosted five @entity41 and two baseball @entity42 in the past			0
when soccer games are staged there , it has a capacity of 74,918 but only 10,000 are expected for the @entity1 vs @entity5 game			1
local interest is low because the 3pm kick - off clashes with work and not too many @entity1 fans have travelled over , preferring to save their money for the @entity3 in @entity55			1
the venue : @entity1 will play @entity5 at the @entity6 , the home of @entity35 team @entity36 through their paces : the @entity1 team train at the @entity6 ahead of wednesday night 's match are @entity5 in the @entity3 ? yes they are			1
they finished fourth in the @entity64 qualification group , behind @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity67 , after taking 25 points from 16 matches			2
' home advantage ' gains a new definition when it comes to @entity5 , as they play their games in @entity22 , 9,300ft above sea level up in the @entity76			2
it is the highest capital city in the world and their opponents do n't like visiting			0
in the qualification campaign , they won seven and drew one of their matches there ( @entity65 earned a 1 - 1 draw )			2
heading for @entity55 : the @entity5 team train at the @entity6 ahead of their final warm - up friendly			1
they have been paired with @entity90 , @entity91 and @entity13 in @entity92 when they go down the mountain , @entity5 are nowhere near as effective - in qualifying , they lost five and drew three on the road			1
they 've been paired with @entity91 , @entity13 and @entity90 in @entity92 and will fancy their chances of progressing to the knockout phase			1
they open against @entity91 in @entity103 on june 15 , then play @entity13 in @entity104 on june 20 and @entity90 in @entity105 on june 25			1
eyes on the ball : defender @entity108 during training in @entity7 on tuesday what 's their @entity3 pedigree ? @entity5 have qualified for the @entity3 finals on two previous occasions			1
they made their bow in 2002 , losing to @entity116 and @entity117 before beating @entity118 in @entity119 returning in 2006 , wins over @entity120 and @entity121 were enough to see them out of @entity123 behind hosts @entity124			0
as you 'll probably remember , @entity1 knocked them out in the last 16 thanks to @entity129 's second - half free - kick			2
bend it like ... @entity129 curls home @entity1 's winner against @entity5 in the 2006 @entity3 second round celebration time : @entity129 is grabbed by @entity135 after his free - kick found the back of the net goalkeepers : @entity140 ( @entity141 ) , @entity142 ( @entity143 ) , @entity144 ( @entity145 ) defenders : @entity147 ( @entity148 ) , @entity149 , @entity150 , @entity151 ( all @entity152 ) , @entity108 ( @entity153 ) , @entity154 ( @entity141 ) midfielders : @entity156 ( @entity157 ) , @entity158 ( @entity159 ) , @entity160 ( @entity161 ) , @entity162 ( @entity163 ) , @entity164 ( @entity141 ) , @entity165 ( @entity166 ) , @entity167 ( @entity168 ) , @entity169 ( @entity170 ) forwards : @entity172 ( @entity173 ) , @entity174 ( @entity175 ) , @entity176 ( @entity177 ) , @entity178 , @entity179 ( both @entity180 ) , @entity181 ( @entity153 ) who 's in the final 23 for @entity55 ? coach @entity183 named his final squad list on monday following a friendly with @entity117 over the weekend			1
he included @entity156 in the 23 despite the midfielder needing another three weeks to recover from a knee injury sustained in that match			1
the coach considers @entity156 , a veteran of their last tournament back in 2006 , an essential part of his team though he might not see any action after taking a nasty knock on the knee in the clash that saw @entity117 's @entity197 break his leg			1
@entity183 's only surprise pick is the 19 - year - old @entity159 midfielder @entity158			0
what kind of form are they in ? @entity5 have played three matches this year , with varied results			0
they stormed back from three goals down to beat @entity208 4 - 3 in a friendly played at @entity209 back in march , held @entity210 to a 1 - 1 draw in the @entity212 last month and then lost 3 - 1 to @entity117 in @entity213 , @entity214 on saturday			1
contrasting emotions : @entity167 looks on as @entity117 celebrate a goal by @entity197 ( no 20 ) in saturday 's friendly in @entity213 who 's the boss ? 57 - year - old @entity220 @entity183 took charge in 2010			1
he guided @entity13 to only their second - ever @entity3 but came in for criticism for the tactics he deployed out in @entity226 and subsequently stepped down			2
he negotiated @entity5 to the finals in @entity55 without any trouble and now he will be expected to at least match their run to the last 16 back in 2006			2
@entity183 was asked about the threat posed by @entity232 in wednesday night 's match but he chose to concentrate on the collective			0
the boss : @entity183 has been @entity5 manager since 2010 ' their team is at a tremendous level throughout , so it 's not just about one player , ' he said			2
' @entity232 is a goalscorer and a leader , we know that , but @entity1 have @entity243 , they have @entity244 , they have @entity245 , they have @entity246			0
' @entity232 is @entity232 , but we focus on the collective and they are a strong side			0
' which players will i recognise ? @entity165 is the name that leaps from the @entity5 teamsheet			0
the @entity166 winger continues to delight and infuriate the @entity255 faithful in equal measure - in some matches , his pace and crossing can be a real weapon ; in others , he barely registers			0
main man : @entity166 winger @entity165 in action for his country against @entity208 back in march @entity181 , 28 , contributed four goals and six assists for @entity166 last season , a pretty dismal return for someone of his ability			0
if @entity5 are to make waves in this tournament , they need their captain and talisman to be at the top of his game			2
you might also remember @entity172 , the striker who made a few appearances for @entity281 after moving from @entity282 for Â £ 5.2m in january 2008 but spent most of his time out on loan			0
he 's still only 25 but now plays for @entity173 in the @entity285 after a two - year stop - off at @entity287			0
practice : former @entity281 striker @entity172 perfects his shooting technique in training who else should i look out for ? @entity174 's stock rose back in november when @entity181 said he would n't mind if @entity166 signed him			0
the winger is well travelled for his 24 years , with 39 international caps and eight goals to his name			0
having been unable to hold down a first team place during his two seasons at @entity300 , @entity174 now plays for @entity301 side @entity175			0
speedster : @entity174 shows the @entity301 defence a clean pair of heels during the weekend 's friendly match the aforementioned @entity156 , 32 , spent some time in @entity1 on loan at @entity307 and then @entity308 while playing for @entity309 and now plays for @entity157 in @entity310			1
@entity307 fans may remember his one and only goal for the club , a 25 - yard volley against @entity316 in a 2008 @entity318 tie			0
ouch : the collision between @entity117 's @entity197 and @entity5 's @entity156 that left the former out of the @entity3 and the latter fighting for fitness @entity323 , another midfielder , plays for @entity163 and has been in @entity324 for seven years now			1
the 29 - year - old won two @entity324 league titles with his former club @entity327 and played in the @entity328			0
@entity329 remember this song ?			0

@entity1 will take on @entity64 at @entity6 in @entity7
*penultimate* friendly for @entity11 's team ahead of @entity3 in @entity55
@entity5 paired with @entity90 , @entity91 and @entity13 in @entity92
lost 3 - 1 to @entity117 in last warm - up friendly in @entity214 on saturday
