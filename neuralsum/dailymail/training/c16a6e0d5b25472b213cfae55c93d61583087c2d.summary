the lesbian parents of an 11 - year - old boy who is undergoing the process of becoming a girl last night defended the decision , claiming it was better for a child to have a sex change when young			1
@entity8 , who now calls himself @entity9 , is undergoing controversial hormone blocking treatment in @entity11 , @entity12 to stop him going through puberty as a boy			2
but @entity15 and @entity16 warn that children with gender identity disorder forced to postpone transitioning could face a higher risk of suicide			2
at age seven , after threatening genital mutilation on himself , psychiatrists diagnosed @entity38 with gender identity disorder			1
by the age of eight , he began transitioning			2
this summer , he started taking hormone - blocking drugs , which will stop him from experiencing puberty			2
the hormone - suppressant , implanted in his upper left arm , will postpone the 11 - year - old developing broad shoulders , deep voice and facial hair			2
the couple faced intense criticism from friends and family as a result , ms @entity15 told @entity60			2
' everybody was angry with us			2
" how could you be doing this ? you might be ruining his whole life ! " citing a statistic from the @entity69 , ms @entity15 noted over 50 per cent of transgender youth will have had at least one suicide attempt by their 20th birthday			2
proud mom : two photos of @entity9 from one of @entity15 's @entity78 albums called ' my sweet sweet princess ' here is @entity9 with her mothers and older brother @entity83 at his recent bar mitzvah			1
mother @entity15 said @entity9 was shy and unhappy as a boy when compared to her older , outgoing brothers @entity9 favours headbands to baseball hats and picked out bras and dresses to start wearing when given choice in clothing to wear and ignoring their son 's incessant pleas , she said , simply was not worth the risk			1
' what is so frightening to me is that you would be willing to say " no " just because you do n't like it - even though your child could lose their life ? ' her son 's adolescent transition , she hopes , will help him have a less conflicted adulthood			1
' the whole idea now is let 's stop creating a third ( gender ) that is neither one thing or the other , so we transitioned her , ' said ms @entity15			1
' the protocol now is to transition these children as soon as you can make a diagnosis , because otherwise they end up being not one thing or the other ... because they experienced puberty			0
' @entity117 's hormones are being blocked by an implant on the inside of the 11 - year - old 's upper left arm , which must be replaced once a year			1
ms @entity15 explained : ' in other words , she will stay as a pre-pubescent boy until she decides and we feel that she can make this decision about surgery			0
' his parents say the hormone treatment will give him time to figure out if he wants to fully transition to being female or go through puberty as a boy			1
by age 14 or 15 the device will need to be removed so that @entity9 can go through puberty , ms @entity15 said			0
if he chooses to stop taking the drugs , he will undergo natural male puberty at a later stage and his future fertility would not be impacted			0
should their son decide to transition to an adult female , he can take female hormones as well , which would raise his voice , allow him to grow breasts and develop other feminine physical characteristics			1
ms @entity15 recalled the first step of @entity38 ' transition to becoming female by letting him pick his own clothes			1
he favoured headbands to baseball hats and picked out bras and dresses to start wearing when given choice in clothing to wear			0
and the change in his personality , ms @entity15 says , was instant			1
' he was in his own world just completely detached and that was a problem we always had was getting @entity38 to participate in life , ' she said			1
' what we saw emerge when @entity9 was allowed to be @entity9 is , " whoa ! " ... it was an immediate transformation			0
she was so giggly and she was now interacting she was now making it a point to defend herself			0
' the diagnosis has been hard to accept for @entity9 's parents			1
the couple were married in 1990 by a rabbi and have two older sons and grandchildren			0
but they insist their sexuality has nothing to do with it			0
' it was odd to us , ' she said			0
' even though she has lesbians as parents , this is all new to us in every possible way			1
we know what it 's like to feel different - we 've got that one			1
but to feel like you 're not in the right body was just something we could not put our heads around			0
' fortunately , the family has a vast support system			0
the couple credits @entity9 's teachers and officials at @entity198 in @entity199 , @entity12 , and their religious community , for being open - minded about their son 's decision			1
' we live in the @entity203 where lots of alternative lifestyles are in place ... and we belong to a religious community that was incredibly supportive			0
they make it a point when we 're in synagogue to come over and tell @entity9 , " oh , you look so pretty today , ' ms @entity15 said , adding , ' there 's never going to be enough gratitude for them			1
' his parents say the hormone treatment will give him time to figure out if he wants to fully transition to being female or go through puberty as a boy			1
if he chooses to stop taking the drugs , he will undergo natural male puberty at a later stage and his future fertility would not be impacted			0
