@entity0 insists under - fire @entity2 boss @entity1 is the right man to take the club forward despite their poor start to the season			1
the @entity6 have failed to reach the dizzy heights of last season 's impressive second placed finish , as they currently lie 18 points off the leaders @entity12 in 12th position			1
however , @entity0 is not overly surprised by the slump in @entity2 's form , believing too much was expected of their squad at the beginning of the season			1
@entity0 did n't hold back when discussing @entity2 's current woes on @entity21 @entity1 has a heap of problems with @entity2 only winning twice in the league since august speaking on @entity21 he said : ' there were unrealistic targets set for @entity2 this season , especially with @entity28 leaving the club			1
' without him ( @entity28 ) last season they would have finished seventh at the end of the day			2
' and now without him they are around about where they have been for the four seasons prior to last when they were second			0
' @entity2 have consistently finished in the @entity39 positions and when i look at their squad now that 's where i think they 'll finish			2
' i still think he ( @entity1 ) is the right man for the job though and should be given more time , but understandably at the moment he is under pressure			0
' @entity48 has still failed to find the net for @entity2 in the @entity50 since joining from @entity51 despite stating that @entity1 needs more time to turn @entity2 's fortunes around , he does think the former @entity54 manager must stop making excuses for his side 's poor form			1
some of the reasons the @entity59 has cited for their demise include the lack of experience in the @entity64 squad , as well as their on - going involvement in @entity67 , but @entity0 has rejected such claims			2
he added : ' i do n't understand the excuses made about @entity2 's season being disrupted by playing in @entity67			1
it 's actually a lot easier competing in the @entity72 than the @entity39			0
' this is especially the case in terms of preparation and recovery , as you can be travelling a lot further away while playing in the @entity39 as opposed to the @entity72			0
the @entity64 boss hinted at issues within the dressing room after another defeat in the league ' for me there 's more than enough experience in that side too			0
i keep hearing that this @entity2 side is a young one but the average age of the team against @entity90 was 26 , and for a @entity50 side that is n't young at all			1
' a lot of these players have played in @entity67 as well , so should have the experience required to get themselves a win in these kind of games ( against @entity90 )			0
' @entity0 has also not been impressed with the impact @entity1 ' summer signings have made at the club , with £ 16million man @entity48 in particular being singled out for notable criticism			2
' as a manager you live and die by your signings and at the moment i do n't think his ( @entity1 ) signings have been good enough			0
' fellow pundit @entity108 reinforced this view , stating that only @entity110 and maybe @entity111 , could be classed as successful signings out of all of the players @entity1 has brought to the club , with £ 213million spent in the process , since taking over in 2012 .			0
