@entity8 , 80 , from @entity9 , @entity10 , was suffering from ' dizziness ' and went to hospital so he could get better for his daughter 's wedding			1
but doctors wrongly prescribed him with an antibiotic containing penicillin , because the sticky yellow paper was covering the allergy section of his chart			1

mrs @entity22 told the hearing that her father had previously suffered from bowel cancer and lymphoma , but believed he was getting better			0
she said : ' i thought he had improved that much that i was going to leave			0
‘ nurse @entity40 came and injected into the catheter in his hand			0
as soon as it was administered she left			0
‘ @entity44 started shaking and i had my hand on his heart and chest asking if he was ok			2
' ms @entity22 and her family waited outside while doctors treated her father , she saw him later and said , ‘ his face was really red and swollen to a point where he did n’t look like my dad at all			0

’ doctors at @entity21 in @entity9 , @entity10 , did not see the allergy information on his medical chart because it was covered by a post-it note dr @entity30 , who was in the first of three years of specialist medical training at the time of the incident , was instructed by dr @entity69 , to prescribe an antibiotic			1
he said he chose the drug because of protocols concerned with hospital - acquired chest infections and @entity74			1
... ‘ @entity44 started shaking and i had my hand on his heart and chest asking if he was ok ' he told the court : ‘ we had been through the notes of his admission and past medical history			0
‘ in there would have been record of his allergy			0
that may not have been on my mind , i may have been focusing on the neurological problem			0
‘ i do recall when i lifted it there was a post-it note on the drug chart			2
it almost becomes an automatic reaction to look at the allergy section and sadly on that day i do n’t think i looked under the post-it note			1
’ nurse @entity95 , who injected mr @entity8 with the drug , said she checked for allergies but did n’t see the warning because of the note			1
