grammy winner @entity0 has hit out at music legend @entity1 for ' spreading false information ' about her in his new tell - all memoir			1
the 30 - year - old star wrote a damming open letter today after the record executive claimed that she broke into ' hysterical sobbing ' when he demanded that her smash hit ' since u been gone ' be included on her album , @entity11			1
@entity0 - whose stellar career was guided by @entity1 after she won @entity13 - lashed out , saying : ' i refuse to be bullied and i just have to clear up his memory lapses and misinformation for myself and for my fans			1
it feels like a violation			1
growing up is awesome because you learn you do n't have to cower to anyone - even @entity1			2
' happier times : record legend @entity1 with his protege @entity0 in 2004			1
today , she accused him of ' bullying ' her			1
in what is turning into a war of words between the pair the 80 - year - old took to @entity29 to defend his book , writing : ' i am truly very sorry that she has decided to take issue with what i know to be an accurate depiction of our time together			2
“ before the book was published , i had every fact checked with five independent individuals who were present on a daily basis throughout it all			0
' in his book , @entity42 , the 80 - year - old music executive - who discovered @entity44 - tells how he fell out with @entity0 over her desire to help pen her own songs on her third album , my december			1
however , @entity1 recalled that he did n't believe the material contained a number one hit and told the singer 's manager he was ' out of his mind ' to believe otherwise			2
emotional : @entity0 is overcome as she picks up the @entity54 for best pop vocal album this month he also wrote about a meeting with @entity0 in in which he told her that my december was “ a pop album that still needs pop hits '			1
but in a lengthy statement posted on @entity62 , @entity0 wrote : ' so i just heard @entity1 is releasing a memoir and spreading false information about me and my music			1
' first , he says i burst into " hysterical sobbing " in his office when he demanded since you been gone be on my album			1
his stories and songs are mixed up			0
' she said they rowed after @entity0 insisted that she wanted more guitars added to the original demo track - and @entity1 did not , saying she eventually prevailed , adding : ' i could n't be more proud of the life of that song			1
i resent him dampening that song in any way			0
' but , yes , i did cry in his office once			0
i cried after i played him a song i had written about my life called " because of you			0
" ' i cried because he hated it and told me verbatim that i was a " s * * * * y writer who should be grateful for the gifts that he bestows upon me			0
' ' he continued on about how the song did n't rhyme and how i should just shut up and sing			0
this was devastating coming from a man who i , as a young girl , considered a musical hero and was so honored to work with			0
' but i continued to fight for the song and the label relented			0
and it became a worldwide hit			2
he did n't include that in the book			0
' @entity1 replied on @entity29 : ' the chapter [ @entity0 's ] as it is written was thoroughly verified by each and every one of them			1
i stand by the chapter as written in my book			0
at the same time i wish , and will always wish , @entity0 ‘ s talent and her career to soar to ever new heights			1
overjoyed : @entity0 picked up her third grammy of her career at the music awards ceremony in @entity111 on february 10 @entity0 revealed that she was hurt by his accusations about her album my december and its lack of ' pop hits ' - and the claims that it did n't chart to well because she co-wrote it			1
she also accused @entity1 , currently the chief creative officer of @entity120 , of actively trying to ' sabotage ' the album			1
she said ' well , first let me say , i 've co-penned many of my " pop hits			0
" secondly , my december went platinum ( it sold 20,000 less than @entity126 which followed my december			0
) hardly a huge failure			0
' never again , the only single they released in the @entity130 from that record was a @entity133 hit			2
' i am very proud of that and i have my fans to thank			0
but , again , what 's most interesting about his story is what he leaves out : he does n't mention how he stood up in front of his company at a convention and belittled me and my music and completely sabotaged the entire project			2
engaged : @entity0 and her fiance , @entity146 , beam at the @entity54 earlier this month @entity147 hits : @entity0 in her videos for @entity149 ' it never had a chance to reach it 's full potential			1
my december was an album i needed to make for myself for many reasons and the fact that i was so completely disregarded and disrespected was so disheartening , there really are n't words to explain …			2
' @entity0 , who is signed to @entity160 records , won her third @entity54 earlier this month for @entity161 for her fifth studio album , @entity163			1
and the star , who is engaged to music manager @entity146 , finished her message by writing : ' anyway , i love my job			2
i love my label and all of my professional relationships … now			0
and i am grateful for @entity1 for teaching me to know the difference			0
' cheers to another amazing year			0
