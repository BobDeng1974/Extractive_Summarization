@entity0 said eight members of staff have been dismissed after a financial scandal @entity0 has fired eight members of staff and withheld bonuses worth £ 3million as part of disciplinary action taken in the wake of july 's revelations about rate - fixing			1
the financial giant was hit with fines totalling £ 218million after an investigation found it had rigged the @entity14 benchmark interest rate			1
however , the group has been unable to take any action against a number of individuals who had already left the bank prior to the bank 's £ 218 million settlement with @entity23 and @entity24 regulators			2
@entity0 said it has shared all relevant information with @entity27 regulator the @entity29 and other relevant authorities			2
in july , @entity31 governor @entity30 described the actions of @entity0 between 2006 and 2009 as ' highly reprehensible , clearly unlawful and may amount to criminal conduct on the part of the individuals involved '			1
@entity0 said unvested bonuses and long term incentives totalling around £ 3 million in aggregate for the fired individuals will be forfeited			2
chairman @entity39 said the significant reputational damage and financial cost to the group will also be reflected in the options considered in relation to other staff bonus payments			0
he said : ' the board has been clear that it views the actions of those responsible for the misconduct referred to in the settlements as being completely unacceptable			0
' it is entirely right that the group undertook a prompt , independent and thorough disciplinary process immediately after the settlements were announced and has taken appropriate action as a result			0
a number if individuals have been dismissed			0
' three of the ' @entity60 ' @entity23 banks were penalised for the libor scandal , two years after @entity62 became the first to be hit with a £ 290million fine			1
the state - backed lender said at the time that the manipulation took place between may 2006 and 2009 , and confirmed that those involved had either left the group , were suspended or subject to disciplinary proceedings			1
its investigation was believed to have focussed on 15 members of staff			0
he added : ' the changes we have implemented over the last three years as part of our successful customer - focused and @entity23 - centric strategy have created a culture and values that focus totally on our retail and commercial customers			1
' the settlements followed allegations that banks formed cartels to fix two key interest rates used to set the price at which banks lend money to each other for trillions of dollars - worth of financial products , from mortgages to complex financial products			2
some £ 70million of @entity0 ' fine is for attempting to manipulate fees that it owed for taking part in a taxpayer - backed government scheme designed to support the @entity23 's banks during the financial crisis			1
while @entity0 ' misconduct related to libor rigging was similar to that of other financial institutions , the rigging of this scheme – the @entity114 – had not been seen before by regulators			1
@entity0 will pay the bank £ 7.8 million in compensation for the reduction in the amount of fees received by the central bank as a result of the manipulation			1
the £ 105million total fine from the @entity29 is the joint third highest ever imposed by the regulator or its predecessor , the @entity132 , and the seventh penalty for @entity14 - related failures			1
@entity14 stands for the @entity135 and is a measure of the interest rate banks charge to borrow between each other			1
the rate is set every morning by a panel of banks and overseen by trade body the @entity143			2
each bank sets the rates at which it believes it can borrow , from overnight to 12 months			0
there are 150 libor rates , spanning ten currencies and 15 time periods			0
it heavily influences how banks price variable rate mortages , such as new tracker and discount deals and standard variable rates			2
some borrowers also have mortgages linked directly to @entity14 , which are typically reset every three months			0
traders could make money from tiny movements in the rate due to the millions being gambled on them , however , by the time these shifts of fractions of one per cent reach mortgage pricing their effect would be minimal			0
even those whose mortgages were directly linked to @entity14 would find changes in their interest rate would have little overall effect			1
as part of the settlements on @entity14 rigging , @entity0 had to pay £ 35million to the @entity29 and £ 62million and £ 51 million respectively to the @entity173 and the @entity174			1
@entity175 , the @entity29 's director of enforcement and financial crime , said at the time : ' the firms were a significant beneficiary of financial assistance from the @entity31 through the sls			0
' colluding to benefit the firms at the expense , ultimately , of the @entity23 taxpayer was unacceptable			2
this falls well short of the standards the @entity29 and the market is entitled to expect from regulated firms			0
' the abuse of the @entity114 is a novel feature of this case but the underlying conduct and the underlying failings - to identify , mitigate and monitor for obvious risks - are not new			0
' if trust in financial services is to be restored then market participants need to ensure they are learning the lessons from , and avoiding the mistakes of , their peers			0
our enforcement actions are an important source of information to help them do this			0
