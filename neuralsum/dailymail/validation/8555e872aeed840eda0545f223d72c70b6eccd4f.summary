@entity2 is locked in a post-snowden ‘ arms race ’ with terrorists who are using technology to spy on the security services and put ‘ our people and agents at risk ’ , the head of @entity1 warned last night			1
in his first public speech , @entity10 made a series of pointed references to how @entity2 intelligence agencies operate within some of the strictest laws in the world while our enemies were ‘ unconstrained ’			1
his comments will be seen as a rejection of the barrage of criticism aimed at @entity1 , @entity24 and @entity25 by @entity27 ‘ whistleblower ’ @entity26 and his supporters in the @entity2			1
@entity26 ’s cheerleaders claim he exposed mass unauthorised surveillance by the security services			1
@entity1 chief @entity10 said @entity2 was locked in a post-snowden ‘ arms race ’ with terrorists who are using technology to spy on the security services and put ‘ our people and agents at risk ’ but mr @entity10 said : ‘ what really distinguishes us from our opponents is that we live by the values of this country and are regulated by its laws , even as we work in secret			1
’ he warned that terror groups such as @entity47 and @entity48 were increasingly using the internet to target the intelligence agencies			0
spy chiefs say the leaks revealed by @entity26 – who stole 1.7million classified documents – had revealed sensitive intelligence gathering techniques			1
sources have also warned the @entity26 files may have put individual agents in danger by revealing their identities or location			2
mr @entity10 said : ‘ the internet and big data can combine to our advantage , allowing us to know more about the people we meet and the places we meet them			2
using data appropriately and proportionately offers us a priceless opportunity to be even more deliberate and targeted in what we do , and so to be better at protecting our agents and this country			0
@entity26 – who stole 1.7million classified documents – revealed sensitive intelligence gathering techniques ‘ the bad news is that the same technology in opposition hands , an opposition often unconstrained by consideration of ethics and law , allows them to see what we are doing and put our people and agents at risk			1
‘ so we find ourselves in a technology arms race			0
contrary to myth , human intelligence operations are not an alternative to technical operations ; the two are interdependent and are set to become more so			0
’ the spy chief did not mention @entity26 by name			2
but , in a speech earlier this year , his predecessor sir @entity92 said : ‘ @entity26 threw a massive rock in the pool			2
the ripples from that have still not died down			0
’ earlier this month , home secretary @entity98 added that the leaks by @entity26 had ‘ damaged ’ intelligence agencies across the world and drained @entity2 ’s spies of vital resources			2
mr @entity10 was speaking at the unveiling of an @entity106 blue plaque at the home of the first @entity1 chief , sir @entity108			1
known as ‘ c ’ due to his habit of initialling his papers , sir @entity109 lived and worked at 2 @entity114 in @entity115 at various times between 1911 and 1922			0
mr @entity10 said : naturally , he would be as taken aback as any of his contemporaries at the way in which @entity2 ’s role in the world has altered			0
it fell to him to protect @entity2 ’s interests as an imperial power during a great war			0
my task is a bit more subtle , but no less taxing			0
