researchers have mapped dark matter in several colliding galaxy clusters more than a billion light - years away			1
and one outcome of the research is that dark matter might not actually be composed of particles , as previously thought			1
instead , a number of theories ranging from it being a fluid , to not existing at all , have been presented by researchers - who also say it is likely ' weirder than we first thought			0
' researchers in @entity13 and the @entity14 mapped dark matter in clusters ( shown in blue ) , and discovered that dark matter might be ' weirder than we thought '			1
clockwise from top left , the galaxy clusters are : @entity23 j0416.1 +2403 , @entity24 +2852 , @entity25 +3745 , @entity26 1358 +62 , @entity27 and @entity28 the research was carried out by scientists from the @entity31 ( @entity31 ) in @entity13 , the @entity32 and @entity33			0
they used data from the @entity36 and the @entity37 to measure galaxy clusters - collections of hundreds of galaxies			0
surprisingly , the study discovered that dark matter ‘ particles ’ may simply pass through each other when galaxy clusters collide			1
‘ this work looks at the way dark matter interacts with itself when massive clouds of it are smashed together with other massive clouds , ’ lead author dr @entity45 from @entity46 told @entity53			1
when physicists study the dynamics of galaxies and the movement of stars , they are confronted with a mystery			0
if they only take visible matter into account , their equations simply do n't add up ; the elements that can be observed are not sufficient to explain the rotation of objects and the existing gravitational forces			0
from this they deduced that there must be an invisible kind of matter that does not interact with light but does , as a whole , interact by means of the gravitational force			0
called ' dark matter ' , this substance appears to make up at least 80 per cent of the matter in the known universe			2
‘ we find that when this happens , the dark matter does not get affected at all and it carries on unimpeded			2
’ this implies that dark matter particles do not interact with themselves , which would have caused dark matter to slow down			1
instead , it appears that while dark matter could interact ‘ non-gravitationally ’ with visible matter , this is not the case when it interacts with itself			2
more importantly , the study challenges the view that dark matter consists of proton - like particles - or perhaps any particles whatsoever			1
‘ the implications for dark matter are that it rules out some models of particle dark matter , for example it challenges the idea that dark matter is made of an equivalent ' dark proton ' that is exchanging ' dark photons ’ , ’ said dr @entity45			1
‘ to say we can conclude that dark matter is not a particle is too far , but we are challenging many models of dark matter , and it remains to be seen whether dark matter is a particle as many lines of research are yet to prove this			1
’ using the @entity36 ( shown from @entity119 in 2009 ) , the team observed distant galaxies that were more than a billion light - years away			0
they were able to work out the pattern of distortion caused by dark matter , and make maps of where it should be @entity45 's data came from the @entity129 and the @entity36 telescope , and included the famous @entity132 collision ( shown ) , a collision of two galaxy clusters whose gas has been molded into the shape of a bullet			1
this particular collision is the best current evidence for the existence of dark matter dr @entity142 , one of the authors on the study , told @entity53 that it was most likely a different type of particle to what scientists had been looking for so far			1
‘ but there are those very weird theories that also might be able to replace this , ’ he said			0
one theory is that perhaps the theory of gravity , first proposed by @entity155 , is wrong - and dark matter does n’t actually exist at all			2
all of our evidence for dark matter so far comes from its supposed gravitational effect on galaxies - but if our models of gravity are wrong , then this could be false evidence			1
‘ alternatively , dark matter could be some kind of fluid , rather than a particle with a property in space , ’ dr @entity142 said			1
another theory is that dark matter is made out of ‘ glue balls ’ , which are a conglomeration of smaller particles ‘ glued ’ together in an ensemble			1
the researchers created the maps by studying the effects dark matter had on extremely distant galaxies			1
while dark matter ca n’t be seen directly , it ’s presence can be predicted based on these interactions			2
‘ we ca n’t observe wind , but you know it ’s there because leaves are floating around , ’ said co-author dr @entity142 from @entity33 's @entity187			0
‘ dark matter is similar , we ca n’t see it , but it pulls things around a bit			2
’ using the @entity36 , the team observed distant galaxies that were more than a billion light - years away			0
they were able to work out the pattern of distortion caused by dark matter , and make maps of where it should be			2
but the fascinating conclusion was that dark matter does not interact with itself - or , perhaps , even other matter - in ways we would think			2
‘ if you hit your head against a wall of dark matter , your head would go straight through , ’ explained dr @entity142			1
‘ this makes it very difficult stuff to work with			0
’ ‘ dark matter is all around our own galaxy , all around @entity222 , and is passing through us right now , but it does n’t have an effect on us			2
’ he added that it was ‘ embarrassing ’ that we knew so little about dark matter , despite seeming to be a ‘ parallel universe ’ that was far more important than our own			2
and from their study , the researchers conclude that dark matter is even ‘ weirder than we first thought			1
’ the scientists also used data from the @entity37 ( illustration shown ) to measure dark matter in the distant galaxies			2
but it is very difficult to find			0
‘ if you hit your head against a wall of dark matter , your head would go straight through , ’ explained co-author dr @entity142 the fascinating conclusion was that dark matter does not interact with itself - or , perhaps , even other matter - in ways we would think possible			1
shown is the galaxy cluster @entity250 +2403 and its dark matter distribution , shown in blue , based on its gravitational interactions although it accounts for 90 per cent of all matter in the universe and more than a quarter of its energy , scientists still know very little about dark matter			2
after a two - year shutdown and upgrade , the multi-billion dollar @entity260 ( @entity260 ) is about to ramp up for its second three - year run			0
scientists are promising nearly twice the energy and far more violent particle crashes this time around - and hope to get a glimpse of dark matter			2
the team at the @entity271 , or @entity271 , say if nature cooperates , the more powerful beam crashes will give them a peek into the unseen dark universe			0
beams should start running through the giant machine later this month , with the first high energy crashes probably coming in may , accelerator director @entity276 said in a news conference in @entity281			0
scientists hope to see all sorts of new physics , including a first ever glimpse of dark matter , one of the chief focuses of the experiment			0
' i want to see the first light in the dark universe , ' said @entity271 general director @entity293			0
' if i see that , then nature is kind to me			0
' one major idea among astronomers is that dark matter consists of a new subatomic particle that we have n't discovered yet			1
more exotic theories want dark matter to be a quantum defect from the birth of the universe , extra-dimensional mass , or even a modified form of gravity			0
what we do know is that dark matter interacts with cosmic structures through gravity , shaping and molding them			0
for example , dark matter bends light that passes through it , distorting images of distant space objects			0
in addition , dark matter speeds up the motion of galaxies inside galaxy clusters , which are collections of hundreds of galaxies , containing literally astronomical amounts of stars , planets , and gases			1
galaxy clusters are also 90 per cent dark matter , which makes them ideal for studying it , especially when they collide into each other and force their respective dark matters to interact			1
based on this knowledge , dr @entity45 and his colleagues studied data from 72 galaxy cluster collisions			1
these cosmic crashes happen over the course of billions of years when galaxy clusters attract each other because of their gargantuan masses			0
when this happens , the dark matter in each galaxy cluster interacts with that of the other , offering a unique opportunity to study it			0
the team 's data came from the @entity129 and the @entity36 telescope , and included the famous @entity132 collision , a collision of two galaxy clusters whose gas has been molded into the shape of a bullet			0
and so far , this particular collision is the best evidence for the existence of dark matter , based on its interaction with the clusters			1
in the coming years , scientists will be hoping to directly observe dark matter particles in a number of detectors - including the @entity260 at @entity271			1
what form it will take , though , or whether it is really there , remains to be seen .			0

researchers in @entity13 and the @entity14 mapped dark matter in clusters
they discovered that dark matter ' particles ' pass through themselves
this suggests dark matter may not actually be composed of particles
it could instead be like a ' fluid ' , or something else entirely
