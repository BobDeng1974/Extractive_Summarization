tens of thousands of young children are suffering from rotting teeth caused by drinking fruit juice and squash , a major study has revealed			1
as many as one in eight children have suffered tooth decay by the age of three – although in some parts of @entity13 the rates are as high as a third			2
senior dentists say the problem is often caused by well - meaning parents giving toddlers sugar - laden drinks in bottles and beakers			2
they are now urging families to restrict children to milk and water			1
one health official observed : ‘ @entity34 sugar is no better than any other sugar			0
’ earlier this year health officials urged the public to cut their sugar intake to between five and seven teaspoons a day to prevent rising levels of obesity and rotting teeth			1
a 200ml glass of organic apple juice contains 20 grams of sugar – nearly five teaspoons – only slightly less than the same amount of coke , which has 22 grams			0
experts , including the chief medical officer @entity48 , have called for a tax to be slapped on sugary drinks to deter the public from buying them			2
in the first study of its kind , officials at @entity13 – a government agency – examined the teeth of a sample of 53,640 three - year - olds at nursery schools			1
they found an average of 12 per cent – one in eight – had tooth decay ranging from small holes , needing fillings or having teeth extracted			1
if the trend is repeated across @entity13 , then nearly 85,000 three - year - olds have rotten teeth			1
@entity69 has the highest rates , with 34 per cent of three - year - olds having rotten teeth			1
others included the relatively affluent boroughs of @entity74 , @entity75 , at 25 per cent , and @entity76 in @entity77 at 29 per cent			0
@entity78 , director of dental health for @entity13 , said : ‘ the biggest culprit is fruit juice			0
organic apple juice sounds healthy on the packet , but actually it ’s packed with sugar			0
sweets for my sweet : a single glass of orange juice packs a whopping 30.4g of sugar ‘ @entity34 sugar is no better than any other sugar			0
‘ parents think they are doing good , but fruit juice needs to be restricted to one small glass a day			0
‘ our key advice for under three is just have water and milk , that way they wo n’t get a taste for the sweeter liquids that cause decay			1
’ many parents give children fruit juice or squash in bottles and beakers to comfort them or before bed			0
they may suck them for hours on end – with the sugar slowly eroding their teeth			0
officials say if children must have juice it should be from a cup which is drunk quickly , causing minimal harm to their teeth			1
although the decay affects children ’s milk teeth , which fall out naturally , experts say it also harms their gums making them more prone to infection in adulthood			1
this is the first time such a survey has been carried out so it is impossible to know if the problem is getting worse			0
but @entity133 figures published in july showed the number of children being admitted to hospital with tooth decay had risen by 14 per cent in three years			2
dr @entity138 , chairman of the @entity140 ’s dental public health committee , said : ‘ parents may feel that giving sugar - sweetened drinks is comforting , but in reality it ’s more likely to cause pain and suffering as it is the major cause of tooth decay in toddlers			2

in some @entity150 regions as many as a third of children have rotten teeth
@entity69 has the most , with 34 per cent of three - year - olds suffering
experts urge families to restrict children to milk and water
