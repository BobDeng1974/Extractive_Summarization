by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 04:59 est , 17 october 2013 updated : 17:41 est , 17 october 2013 staff at a school for problem pupils have been giving out cigarettes to children as young as 11 and allowing them to smoke in the playground			1
the cigarettes are taken off the youngsters at the start of the day but given back to them during their morning break and at lunchtime			1
the controversial policy , approved by a headteacher , was put in place to stop pupils from leaving the site to have a cigarette – as staff are obliged to do			2
staff at the @entity21 in @entity22 , @entity23 , have given children between 11 and 16 permission to smoke their cigarettes during break and lunchtimes on school grounds but the education authority has launched an investigation and a newly - appointed head at the @entity21 in @entity23 has agreed to end the practice and ban all smoking on the premises			1
the school for 75 pupils aged 11 to 16 , who have behavioural and emotional problems , is attended by some of the city ’s ‘ most challenging young people ’			1
they had been allowed to smoke between 11.10 and 11.20am and from 12.20 to 1.10pm until the policy was changed on wednesday			2
' pupils handed in their cigarettes and possessions each morning and were handed back their cigarettes , at the allocated times each day			1
' considering the youngest are only 11 , it does not seem right			0
staff have to go some way off the school grounds if they wish to smoke			1
' it is understood the policy was put in place by the previous head teacher as a compromise as some of the children were not attending school and were occasionally leaving the premises when they did attend			2
it is thought pupils were allowed to smoke in a controlled environment and to keep them on site			0
the current head teacher has only been in charge for a few days and has agreed to ensure the policy does not continue			0
anti-smoking health campaigners have labeled the decision ' inappropriate , wrong and unethical '			0
and @entity70 education chiefs have launched an investigation at the school for 75 pupils with behavioural and emotional difficulties			0
@entity75 , chief executive of @entity78 anti-smoking health charity @entity76 , said : ' allowing children to smoke at school is wrong in so many ways			1
' it is illegal to sell tobacco to young people under the age of 18 precisely because tobacco is so hazardous to health and wellbeing			1
' it is totally inappropriate and unethical to allow children to smoke in a school environment			1
' the school would n’t allow children to drink so why are they allowing them to smoke ? we urge the school to urgently review this policy			1
' it is believed cigarettes were confiscated at the beginning of the day but then handed back to pupils by staff later in the day @entity100 , regional tobacco control policy manager for @entity102 and the @entity103 , added : ' by the age of 15 , around one in eight school children have become regular smokers			1
just one cigarette can make children more likely to start smoking several years later			0
' children who smoke often become regular adult smokers of which half will die as a result of their habit			2
' children will also suffer immediate health consequences from smoking , coughs , increased phlegm , wheeziness and shortness of breath , and take more time off school ’			2
anti-smoking health campaigners have labelled the decision ' inappropriate , wrong and unethical ' @entity124 , deputy director for children ’s services , at @entity70 said : ' we take this issue very seriously and as soon as it was brought to our attention we spoke to the school and issued an instruction that it must stop immediately			2
' we are confident that this practice has now ceased			0
' the recently appointed headteacher has agreed to review any such practices and to make sure this does not happen in the future we will conduct unannounced visits by local authority staff			0
' we have a strict no smoking policy in all of our schools and encourage them to promote healthy lifestyles to all pupils			0
' the school regularly invites health professionals into school to talk about the dangers of smoking and offers help and advice to stop			0
the schools website states : ' all staff , including support staff work to remove barriers to learning , and support the pastoral needs of learners			0
' it also states they work to provide positive role models			0
a recent @entity162 report noted that the confidence young people have in staff was high .			1

the @entity21 in @entity22 , @entity23 , is being investigated
staff gave children between 11 and 16 permission to smoke at break
cigarettes were confiscated at the beginning of the day then handed back
the school educates ' some of the city ’s most challenging young people '
