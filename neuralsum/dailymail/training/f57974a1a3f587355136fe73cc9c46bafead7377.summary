by @entity0 published : 08:39 est , 3 october 2012 updated : 02:49 est , 4 october 2012 if you are looking for somewhere dry to shelter from the wet autumn weather , do n't visit this art gallery			1
the exhibition consists of a sheet of rain pelting down within the walls of a bare room			0
sensors around the ' @entity11 ' are supposed to detect where visitors are standing and keep them dry			1
the audience is invited to ' experiment with boundaries ' of the work at the @entity19 in @entity20 , and ' see if they can get wet '			1
at least viewers will not have to deal with the obstacles of traffic and pedestrians that flood the streets outside the studio 's doors			1
instead , the room is black and completely bare except for lights highlighting the deluge			0
the studio behind the 100m - sq installation describes it as a marvel of ' technical virtuosity ' and ' sculptural rigour '			1
the raindrops pour from the ceiling on to the grated floor through injection moulded tiles using a system of valves , and pressure regulators			0
custom software and @entity72 tracking cameras are used to stop the water from falling in spots where people are standing			2
no dampened spirits here : the three artists claim the artwork is an opportunity to people - watch and break boundaries ' every day heightened ' : the unusual artwork encourages umbrella - wielding observers to see if they can get wet drizzly and dim : the room is comprised of a dark corridor and brightly lit room , so people passing through will not have to worry about traffic on top of the rain for once but the ' monumental proportions of this carefully choreographed downpour and the sound of water ' may be a little wasted on those who live in this hemisphere			2
thankfully , the soggy experience is free			0
dancers will ' respond ' to the work at the @entity19 's @entity102 exhibition space on four dates , yet to be set			1
visitors are told they can ' control the rain ' depending on how they walk - which the artists - @entity109 @entity108 and @entity111 and @entity112 @entity107 - describe as ' putting your trust in the work to the test			1
' in the spotlight : how sodden observers will take to the interactive installation remains to be seen singin ' in the rain : the @entity19 display is described on the gallery website as a marvel of ' sculptural rigour ' a different spin : dancers will ' respond ' to the ' @entity11 ' at the @entity19 , pictured , over four sundays the trio met in 2005 while students at the @entity128 in @entity20			1
mr @entity107 said the @entity11 was ' a social experiment , designed to extract personality types '			0
' it 's a people - watching space , ' he added			2
' we watch people going in tentatively at first , or if you 're of the ilk of being really excitable and outgoing you might just rush in			0
' this piece is just every day heightened			0
it 's up to people to experiment with it and play with it , to push its boundaries and see if they can get wet			2
' those of a pessimistic disposition may wish to avoid .			0

a sensor is meant to detect where visitors are standing and keep them dry
artists @entity29 call it an exercise in trust
the installation will be on display at the @entity19 's curve from *tomorrow* until march 3 , 2013 .
