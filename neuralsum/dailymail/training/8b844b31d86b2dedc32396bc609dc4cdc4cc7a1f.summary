by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 11:08 est , 4 june 2013 updated : 01:36 est , 5 june 2013 doctors in @entity3 yesterday said @entity5 breast implants are dangerous and must be removed			1
tests showed some of the @entity9 - made implants contain a type of silicone that irritates tissue , according to the @entity13			1
last month , a @entity15 - wide consumer group warned the chemical may harm babies in the womb			1
removal : @entity3 authorities have recommended that the 4,000 women in @entity3 with @entity9 @entity5 breast implants should have them removed as a preventative measure dr @entity23 , who led the latest tests , said they raised concerns about long - term safety			1
warning : women with faulty @entity5 breast implants are at risk of chemical exposure that causes damage to unborn babies , experts have warned she added : ‘ this is a very young group of people who have been subjected to this health risk			1
‘ we have no idea of the long - term effects the implants could have			1
’ the @entity3 guidelines contrast with @entity47 advice that while @entity5 implants are more likely to split , they do not pose a long - term risk			1
other countries to recommend routine removal include @entity9 , @entity51 and the @entity52			1
@entity53 , president of the @entity54 , said more tests must be carried out ‘ as a matter of urgency ’ on the cheap implants , used by 50,000 @entity58 women			1
a @entity47 spokesman said : ‘ the @entity58 regulator keeps all evidence under review and will speak to the @entity3 health authorities to explore the basis for their advice			1
‘ we expect private clinics to care for patients but , if they refuse , the @entity71 will look after them			1
’ the cost of removal in @entity3 will have to be met by the women or by their private clinics			1
questions : @entity77 with her daughter , @entity78 , who lost her battle with cancer last year when @entity82 was diagnosed with cancer aged just 18 months , her mother , @entity81 , was plagued with doubts			1
had the disease been brought on by something she ’d done - or had n’t done ? was it a phone mast or car fumes ? was it something in her genes ? what could have caused her perfect , precious baby girl to be struck down by this vile disease ? not for a moment did she consider the answer could lie in an act of vanity , carried out long before she had children			2
twelve years ago , @entity81 , 40 , from @entity105 , @entity106 , paid £ 3,500 for a breast enlargement operation , taking her from a b cup to a @entity109 tragically , little @entity78 succumbed to a brain tumour last august aged five - and - a - half			2
understandably , it has left @entity81 tortured by guilt , with questions she almost ca n’t bear to have answered			2
‘ it ’s my worst fear , ’ she says			2
‘ if it turned out that i had , through my own vanity , caused my daughter ’s death , i would die			2
’ @entity81 , whose husband @entity119 runs a double glazing company , was initially happy with the results of her operation			2
she had been a flat - chested teenager and very slim , and her new figure gave her more confidence			2
however , she noticed something wrong with her breasts soon after @entity78 arrived in 2007			2
they ’d been fine for years and she ’d had no problems breastfeeding her eldest son @entity129 , now eight			2
‘ but soon after @entity78 was born , i ’d noticed one of my breasts looked lumpy , ’ she says			0
‘ my gp referred me for an ultrasound which showed one of my implants had ruptured			1
but the consultant at the breast screening clinic said there was absolutely no harm in breastfeeding			0
he said i should come back once i ’d finished breastfeeding @entity78 , to have them removed and replaced , but i fell pregnant with my third child , @entity142 , before i could			0
’ five weeks after @entity142 was born in 2008 , @entity78 became tired and lethargic			0
at first , @entity81 and @entity119 thought it was simply a virus , but then they noticed their little girl was sleeping with her head cocked back in a very unnatural way			0
after several weeks of @entity149 visits and tests , @entity81 and @entity119 were told that @entity78 had a brain tumour			0
‘ for the next year , we spent our lives in hospitals and my breasts were not even thought about , ’ says @entity81			0
then the @entity5 scandal broke at the beginning of last year			1
@entity81 contacted her surgeon as soon as she heard the news			0
he said it was very likely that her implants were @entity5			1
‘ i thought : “ @entity161 ” , ’ she says quietly			0
she immediately had her implants removed and replaced , but at the forefront of her mind was @entity78 ’s health			1
@entity78 bravely endured chemotherapy , radiotherapy , and four lots of brain surgery to shrink the tumour			0
but last summer she began to deteriorate			0
scans showed the tumour had grown again and was now inoperable			0
five short weeks later , she died at home with her parents by her side			0
‘ people say time is a great healer , but unfortunately that ’s not true , ’ says @entity81			0
‘ we have learned to function , but we are never going to be all right			0
’ ‘ @entity179 can happen to anyone and we do n’t know if there is a link , ’ she says			0
‘ but i know i had this toxic stuff they were pumping into mattresses inside me , and i know it was leaking			0
could it have passed to @entity78 through my breast milk ? if it does turn out to cause cancer , i just do n’t know what i ’ll do			0

faulty @entity5 implants may pose pregnancy risk , according to experts
authorities in @entity3 asked clinics to contact women with the implants
