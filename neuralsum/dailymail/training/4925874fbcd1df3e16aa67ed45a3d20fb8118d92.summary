by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 10:46 est , 27 november 2013 updated : 20:28 est , 27 november 2013 confronted by a masked burglar in our home in the dead of night , most of us would scream or run away			1
when it happened to @entity9 , she suggested the intruder join her at the kitchen table for a chat			1
the 54 - year - old , who works as a professional mediator , said she sensed from the balaclava - clad criminal ’s body language that he was as frightened as she was			1
calm : @entity19 , 54 , calmly sat down with the balaclava - clad intruder she caught in her home and chatted to him at her kitchen table about what he had done so she invited him to sit down and spent around ten minutes chatting to him before police arrived , pulled off the 17 - year - old ’s mask and arrested him			1
yesterday mrs @entity19 – who spends her working day helping families and businesses resolve conflict and reach agreement – admitted her behaviour during the break - in was ‘ bizarre ’ but said she acted instinctively			1
‘ it was n’t a conscious decision , it just felt like the right thing to do at the time , ’ she said			2
‘ i could see he did n’t mean any harm and he looked terrified			0
i could n’t see his face but i could just sense it through his body language			0
he did n’t seem like a bad lad – he had just done something stupid			0
it was because of that that i felt i could maybe get through to him by talking			0
’ mrs @entity19 and her architect husband were asleep in their @entity53 home in may when they were woken at 2am by the sound of the teenager breaking in			1
they rang 999 from the bedroom and when they saw police pull up outside they went downstairs to open the electric gates and let them into the garden			0
apology : ms @entity19 later met the 17 - year - old as part of the restorative justice programme when the teen told her he was sorry the couple then went into the kitchen and came face - to - face with the burglar , who ‘ leapt out ’ in front of them			1
mrs @entity19 said they were ‘ very alarmed ’ , and although the intruder repeatedly told them ‘ i ’m not going to hurt you ’ he continued to walk towards them			1
but instead of running , mrs @entity19 suggested they sit down for a chat			0
moments later , they were talking at the kitchen table and her husband @entity85 , 59 , felt it was safe to go and find the police officers			1
she said : ‘ we have a big garden and the police got lost trying to find our door so my husband had to go and bring them in			2
he could see the burglar was n’t going to harm me			2
i asked him what he was doing in the house			0
he was happy to talk			0
’ the intruder told her that someone had made him carry out the burglary , but refused to say who			2
she said : ‘ i felt sad for him , he was only a young lad and he was doing something that could mess up his life for good			0
’ the teenager , who can not be named for legal reasons , was later given a nine - month referral order			1
he met mrs @entity19 again under the restorative justice programme , when she told him the incident had happened hours before her mother ’s funeral			1
she said : ‘ he was clearly moved and could n’t speak but then managed to say that he was sorry			0
i just asked him to promise me he would never do it again			0
’ a @entity113 police spokesman said : ‘ it is very rare for a person to be confronted by an intruder in their home			2
our advice is to call the police immediately on 999 and retreat to safety if possible			0
