by @entity0 published : 05:47 est , 3 march 2014 updated : 10:39 est , 3 march 2014 it might be 9,000 years old , but the body of an bison looks as if it could have died just days ago			2
the ancient animal was discovered in july 2011 in a remote part of @entity7 , but scientists are now performing an autopsy in the hope that vital scientific information about the extinction of some bison species around 9,000 years ago will be revealed			1
the autopsy is thought to be the first in the world on such an old bison and scientists will now look for parasites that might have plagued the animals			1
the 9,000 - year - old bison ( pictured ) was discovered in july 2011 in a remote part of @entity7 , but scientists are now performing an autopsy in the hope that vital scientific information about the dying out of the bison around 9,000 years ago will be revealed the autopsy on the @entity30 specimen is the first in on the world on such an old bison			1
scientists from a number of @entity7 and @entity37 institutions are carrying out a full anatomic autopsy			1
this involves removing and describing every organ as well as conducting microbiological and genetic tests and looking for parasites			1
histology samples – those showing the microscopic anatomy of cells and tissues of the animal - are thought to prove the most interesting , as scientists will be able to study parasites attached to ancient bison for the first time			1
researchers hope to map a model of an ancient pasture by studying remains of the foods in the bison 's digestive organs and to publish their research next year			2
the creature was found perfectly preserved in july 2011 in the @entity30 , also known as @entity30 , on the shore of a lake in the north of @entity67 - @entity66 district , where woolly mammoth remains have previously been found			1
its body became visible after part of the shore collapsed into the water			2
' the discovery has an enormous value for scientists since it is the best preserved bison ever found , ’ said @entity77 , chief of the @entity78 of the @entity79			2
he told @entity80 : ‘ we have ascertained that the bison lived 9,000 years ago , at the very beginning of the @entity85 epoch and died aged approximately four			0
' by that time , many mammoths had died here , but the bison still lived			2
’ scientists from a number of @entity7 and @entity37 institutions are carrying out a full anatomic autopsy , which involves removing and describing every organ as well as conducting microbiological and genetic tests and looking for parasites the period began between 9,000 to 12,000 years ago at the close of the @entity96			1
@entity97 began to warm and tundra became forest			0
very large animals that had adapted to extreme cold like the woolly mammoth and woolly rhinoceros became extinct - although woolly mammoths may have lived side - by side bison in parts of @entity7 for a short time			1
humans began to hunt smaller animals			0
one species , @entity110 to which the bison undergoing autopsy might belong , lived in western @entity114 , @entity115 and later in @entity116 before dying out for an unknown reason			2
' the careful and thorough examination we have begun will give us answers to many questions , first of all as to why did the bison die out '			0
scientists from the @entity79 , the @entity124 , @entity125 and the @entity126 of @entity125 are carrying out a full anatomic autopsy , which involves removing and describing every organ as well as conducting microbiological and genetic tests and looking for parasites			1
they are joined by the @entity131 and @entity133 experts from the @entity37 to assist @entity134 , a taxidermist from the @entity136 of the @entity137 , who is leading the autopsy			0
@entity37 scientists have long been studying bison living in @entity116 and hope to compare them to the animal ’s @entity143 relatives			1
the scientists hope to map a model of an ancient pasture by studying remains of the foods in the bison 's digestive organs and to publish their research next year			1
a close - up of a cross section of the rib cage shows the level of preservation of the ancient animal the 9,000 - year - old bison was found perfectly preserved in july 2011 in the @entity30 , also known as @entity30 ( pictured ) on the shore of a lake in the north of @entity67 - @entity66 district , where woolly mammoth remains have previously been found the scientists hope to map a model of an ancient pasture by studying remains of the foods in the bison 's digestive organs and to publish their research next year			1
@entity170 , senior researcher at the @entity171 of the @entity172 , said : ' this is the first study of an ancient mammal for the last 20 years			0
' we have a team of experts from various fields			0
we are keen to learn the animal 's morphology			0
' all its internal organs will be weighed and described			0
all tissue samples will be taken			0
any morphology study [ the structure of an animal ] is connected to the study of animal 's adaptation to his environment and in this particular case to study the palae - ecology will be very interesting			0
here , scientists begin the autopsy and it is possible to see the animal 's perfectly - preserved hair			2
they hope to reveal their findings next year he said that histology samples – the samples showing the microscopic anatomy of cells and tissues of the animal - will prove the most interesting , as they will be the first chance scientists have to studying parasites attached to ancient bison			1
‘ perhaps they did n't preserve , but we will find their dna and the traces of their activity , ’ he said			0
‘ by performing biochemical tests and then comparing them by identical tests of currently living worms we will be able to find out what kind of parasites lived 9,000 years ago			0
' this will be done thanks to a new technology aimed at studying invertebrates ' dna			0
it will be used for the first time on the extinct animal ' .			0

autopsy is thought to be the first in the world on such an old bison
ancient animal was discovered in july 2011 in the @entity30 , or @entity30 , a remote part of @entity7 where mammoths have been discovered
scientists are conducting a full anatomic autopsy , *including* removing every organ and microbiological and genetic tests
