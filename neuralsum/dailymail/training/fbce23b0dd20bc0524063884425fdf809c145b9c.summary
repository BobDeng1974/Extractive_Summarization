the confidential records filed in a lawsuit against the archdiocese disclose how the church handled abuse allegations for decades and also reveal dissent from a top @entity2 aide who criticized his superiors for covering up allegations of abuse rather than protecting children			1
notes inked by @entity2 demonstrate he was disturbed about abuse and sent problem priests for treatment , but there also were lengthy delays or oversights in some cases			1
disclosed info : retired cardinal @entity2 and other top @entity4 officials in @entity33 made efforts to shield molester priests , provide damage control for the church and keep parishioners in the dark the confidential records show how the church handled abuse allegations for decades and also reveal dissent from a top @entity2 aide who criticized his superiors for covering up allegations of abuse rather than protecting children @entity2 received psychological reports on some priests that mentioned the possibility of many other victims , for example , but there is no indication that he or other church leaders investigated further			1
‘ this is all intolerable and unacceptable to me , ’ @entity2 wrote in 1991 on a file of the reverend @entity57 , a priest suspected of locking boys in his room , videotaping their crotches and running up a $ 100 phone sex bill while with a boy			2
@entity57 was sent for therapy and removed from ministry , but @entity2 did n't move to defrock him until 2004 , a decade after the archdiocese lost track of him			1
‘ he is a fugitive from justice , ’ @entity2 wrote to the @entity69 's cardinal @entity68 , who is now pope @entity68			1
‘ a check of the social security index discloses no report of his demise , so presumably he is alive somewhere			0
’ @entity57 died in 2009 , six years after a newspaper reporter found him working at a homeless mission two blocks from a @entity79 elementary school			0
apology : @entity2 was out of town but issued a statement monday apologizing for his mistakes and saying he had been ' naïve ' about the lasting impacts of abuse @entity2 was out of town but issued a statement monday apologizing for his mistakes and saying he had been ‘ naïve ’ about the lasting impacts of abuse			1
he has since met with 90 abuse victims privately and keeps an index card with each victim 's name in his private chapel , where he prays for them daily , he said			0
the card also includes the name of the molesting priest ‘ lest i forget that real priests created this appalling harm			0
’ ‘ it remains my daily and fervent prayer that @entity103 's grace will flood the heart and soul of each victim , and that their life journey continues forward with ever greater healing , ’ @entity2 wrote			2
’ the church 's sex abuse policy was evolving and @entity2 inherited some of the worst cases from his predecessor when he took over in 1985 , @entity116 @entity115 , an archdiocese attorney , said in a separate series of emails			1
priests were sent out of state for psychological treatment because they revealed more when their therapists were not required to report child abuse to law enforcement , as they were in @entity125 , he said			2
at the time , clergy were not mandated sex abuse reporters and the church let the victims ' families decide whether to contact police , he added			2
in at least one case , a priest victimized the children of illegal immigrants and threatened to have them deported if they told , the files show			0
the files are attached to a motion seeking punitive damages in a case involving a @entity142 priest sent to @entity33 in 1987 after he was brutally beaten in his parish south of @entity144			1
when parents complained the reverend @entity148 molested in @entity33 , church officials told the priest but waited two days to call police — allowing him to flee to @entity144 , court papers allege			1
at least 26 children told police they were abused during his 10 months in @entity33			2
the now - defrocked priest is believed to be in @entity144 and remains a fugitive			0
the personnel files of 13 other clerics were attached to the motion to show a cover - up pattern , said attorney @entity160 , who represents the 35 - year - old plaintiff			1
further shielding : the files show @entity2 worked to keep molester priests out of state to avoid criminal and civil trouble in one instance , a memo to @entity2 discusses sending a cleric to a therapist who also is an attorney so any incriminating evidence is protected from authorities by lawyer - client privilege			1
in another instance , archdiocese officials paid a secret salary to a priest exiled to the @entity177 after he and six other clerics were accused of having sex with a teen and impregnating her			2
the exhibits offer a glimpse at some 30,000 pages to be made public as part of a record - setting $ 660 million settlement			0
the archdiocese agreed to give the files to more than 500 victims of priest abuse in 2007 , but a lawyer for about 30 of the priests fought to keep records sealed			1
a judge recently ordered the church to release them without blacking out the names of church higher - ups			0
they echo similar releases from other dioceses nationwide that have shown how church leaders for decades shuffled problem priests from parish to parish , covered up reports of abuse and did n't contact law enforcement			1
top church officials in @entity208 and @entity209 were criminally convicted last year for their roles in covering up abuse , more than a decade after the clergy sex abuse scandal began to unfold in @entity213			1
@entity2 , who retired in 2011 after 26 years at the helm of the 4.3 - million person archdiocese , has been particularly hounded by the case of the reverend @entity217 , who was sentenced to prison in 2007 for molestation — two decades after the priest confessed his abuse to @entity2			1
@entity2 noted the ‘ extremely grave and serious situation ’ when he sent @entity217 for psychological treatment after the priest told him in 1986 that he had molested two brothers over seven years			2
@entity217 returned to ministry the next year with a doctor 's recommendation that he be defrocked immediately if he spent any time with minors			0
despite several documented instances of being alone with boys , the priest was n't removed from ministry until 2000			0
around the same time , the church learned he was conducting baptisms without permission			0
church officials discussed announcing @entity217 's abuse in churches where he had worked , but @entity2 rejected the idea			1
‘ we could open up another firestorm — and it takes us years to recover from those , ’ @entity2 wrote in an october 6 , 2000 , memo			2
‘ is there no alternative to public announcements at all the @entity248 in 15 parishes ? ? ? wow — that really scares the daylights out of me ! ! ’ the aide , monsignor @entity252 , noted his dismay over the matter when he retired in 2001 as vicar for clergy , the top church official who handled priestly discipline			1
in a memo to his successor , @entity252 said @entity217 's attorney disclosed the priest had at least 10 other victims			0
‘ we 've stepped back 20 years and are being driven by the need to cover - up and to keep the presbyteriate & public happily ignorant rather than the need to protect children , ’ @entity252 wrote			0
‘ the only other option is to sit and wait until another victim comes forward			0
then someone else will end up owning the archdiocese of @entity33			2
the liability issues involved aside , i think that course of complete ( in ) action would be immoral and unethical			0
’ @entity2 preferred targeted warnings at schools and youth groups rather than a warning read at @entity248 , @entity115 said			0
parish announcements were made two years later			0
@entity217 , who was paroled in 2011 , is alleged to have molested 20 children in his 26 - year career			0
he could not be reached for comment			0
the files also show @entity2 worked to keep molester priests out of state to avoid criminal and civil trouble			1
one case involved the monsignor @entity252 , a molester whom @entity2 's predecessor sent for treatment in @entity144			2
@entity2 kept @entity252 there after a lawyer warned in 1986 that the archdiocese could face ‘ severe civil liability ’ if he returned and reoffended			2
@entity252 had admitted raping an 11 - year - old boy and later told a psychologist he molested 15 to 17 young boys			0
‘ if monsignor @entity252 were to reappear here within the archdiocese , we might very well have some type of legal action filed in both the criminal and civil sectors , ’ @entity2 wrote to the director of @entity252 's @entity144 treatment program			1
@entity2 then sent @entity252 to another treatment center , but @entity252 returned to @entity33 in 1988 after being removed from ministry			1
he then contacted a victim 's mother and asked to spend time with her younger son , according to a letter in the file			0
@entity2 moved to defrock him in 1989 , and @entity252 died a decade later			0
changing : the church 's sex abuse policy was evolving and @entity2 inherited some of the worst cases from his predecessor when he took over in 1985 , @entity116 @entity115 , an archdiocese attorney , said in a separate series of emails			1
