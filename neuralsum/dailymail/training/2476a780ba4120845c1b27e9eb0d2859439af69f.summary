a size eight woman had no idea she was pregnant ... until her waters broke while she was walking her dog			0
even then , @entity7 - @entity6 , 22 , just thought there was something wrong with her bladder , so went to @entity11 with her fiance @entity12 to have herself checked out			1
and when doctors at @entity14 told her she was about to have a baby she was completely dumbstruck , chiefly because she had never missed a contraceptive pill and had put on scarcely any weight			1
when @entity7 - @entity6 , 22 , pictured , felt her waters break while she was walking her dog , she just thought there was something wrong with her bladder , but three days later she gave birth to baby @entity20 she said : ' it was friday the 13th and i thought they were joking			1
i was in complete shock			0
the doctor said to me : " never in my life have i seen this			0
are you sure you did n't know ? " ' but i really had no idea			0
i did n't look pregnant at all			0
in the last month i 'd put on a tiny bit of weight , but i put this down to comfort eating because i 'd just lost a friend to lung cancer			1
' @entity7 continued : ' my friend died on 11 november , and i 'd spent the last eight months as his full - time carer			1
' since his death i 'd put on about half a stone , and gone from a size eight to a size 10 , but no way did i look pregnant			1
' i just thought i needed to go on a diet			2
i started doing sit - ups and told myself i 'd start going to the gym in january			2
' @entity7 , who lives with chef @entity12 , 42 , in @entity47 , was transferred immediately to the hospital 's labour ward			1
@entity7 and @entity12 , who met three years ago while they were both working at the same bar in @entity52 , were thrilled to finally take @entity20 , pictured , home on monday she said : ' we were both in complete shock			1
i 'd never wanted children - i just was n't a children person			1
@entity12 already had a daughter from a previous relationship , and having children of our own was something we 'd never discussed			1
' when we got to the labour ward i was next to a woman who was screaming her head off and i just thought : ' @entity66 , that 's going to be me soon '			2
i could n't believe i was about to give birth			2
' i fell in love immediately			0
i just sat looking at him thinking : " how has this happened ? " i did n't want a baby , but now he 's here i do n't regret it at all			2
' ' luckily , the nurses realised i need some peace and quiet to come to terms with what was happening and they moved me into a private room			0
i was there for three days before my contractions started			2
' and after a very quick labour lasting just one hour and nine minutes , @entity7 's son @entity20 arrived on 16 december 16 weighing 4lbs 1oz			1
she said : ' they put him on my chest straight away and all i could think was : " what have i just done ? " ' he was born one month prematurely , so they had to take him away to the special care baby unit to check he was ok			2
' later that day i was allowed to go and see him - and i fell in love immediately			2
i just sat looking at him thinking : " how has this happened ? " ' i did n't want a baby , but now he 's here i do n't regret it at all			0
' despite being premature , he 's really healthy and fortunately the fact i kept drinking because i did n't know i was n't pregnant has n't affected him			0
' @entity12 , 42 , with his fiance @entity7 - @entity96 , 22 , with their baby @entity20 who was born in @entity14 on 16 december @entity7 and @entity12 , who met three years ago while they were both working at the same bar in @entity52 , were thrilled to finally take @entity20 home on monday , 6 january , after more than three weeks in hospital			1
she said : ' i still ca n't believe i 'm a mum			0
looking back now there were a couple of signs			0
back in july i 'd been sick for about three days , but i just thought i had a virus that was going round			1
now i know that was morning sickness			0
' i 'd also been having a few feelings in my tummy , but i 'd just put that down to stress because of caring for my terminally - ill friend			1
' i had n't been having any periods , but that was n't unusual for me			0
' i think i was so preoccupied with looking after my terminally - ill friend i was n't paying attention to my own body			1
' she said family and friends had rallied round to help kit them out with secondhand baby clothes and equipment			0
she said : ' we obviously had n't been planning financially to have a baby , so the support from family and friends has been amazing			0
' my life has suddenly changed forever , but i 'm so happy			0
i love @entity20 to bits			1
