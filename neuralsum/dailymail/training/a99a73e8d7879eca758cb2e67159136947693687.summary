by @entity0 published : 05:20 est , 1 january 2013 updated : 03:29 est , 2 january 2013 more than one in four @entity1 have the early signs of liver disease , according to the @entity4 a booze - free january is not enough to repair the liver and keep it healthy , leading experts have warned			1
aside from the fact that many of us simply resume old habits once the month is over , a fatty diet and sedentary lifestyle can be just as damaging , they say			2
a roadshow carried out by @entity15 charity last year found that 28 per cent of people tested were showing the early signs of liver disease			1
if left undetected however , these early signs could lead to permanent liver damage			1
liver disease , now the fifth biggest killer in the @entity1 , has increased in the past year as @entity1 culture continues to embrace the daily consumption of alcohol and unhealthy food choices , combined with a sedentary lifestyle , the trust said			1
with no early warning signs , and tolerance levels varying genetically , liver testing is critical to identify early signs of damage so people can make lifestyle changes to save their lives			1
the charity is calling on the government to make early liver screening available to everyone at risk in a bid to save one million lives a year			1
it believes @entity44 should ask their patients more lifestyle questions and offer a simple liver function test , as they do for patients with suspected high blood pressure			0
the charity made its plea as it launched its second @entity52 awareness campaign , to be led by a nationwide roadshow of ' pop - up ' liver health clinics			2
the trust 's chief executive , @entity56 , said : ' last year the @entity58 found that one in four people tested were showing the early signs of liver disease			1
caught at this early stage , lifestyle changes allow the liver to repair itself			0
' having an alcoholic drink every night , over-indulging in rich food too frequently and not making time for regular exercise are major contributing factors for liver disease			1
' a key issue is that many people do n't realise that regardless of alcohol intake , a lack of exercise and a fatty diet can also cause cirrhosis and liver cancer he told @entity78 : ' in the last five years , we have seen a real decrease in the age of death from liver disease			1
it used to be in the 60s , now it is 58 , and by 2020 we would expect it to be about 50 if it follows this trajectory			0
ten years ago , it was very unusual to see a 30 - year - old in a liver unit awaiting a transplant			0
now it is not uncommon			0
' one key problem is that many of us do n't realise that regardless of alcohol intake , a lack of exercise and a fatty diet can also cause cirrhosis and liver cancer			2
these two factors also cause fat to build up in the liver			0
mr @entity56 added : ' it is a myth that cirrhosis is always caused by alcohol			0
' as everyone is affected differently , and symptoms are almost unrecognisable until the damage is beyond repair , the government needs to take action to help people understand the damage they are doing			0
' it 's not about a quick fix in january , to repair the liver and keep it healthy , people need to follow our three - step plan all - year round : 1 ) take two to three days off alcohol every week ; 2 ) get regular exercise ; 3 ) cut down on sugar and fat			2
' @entity128 campaign offers free screenings to the public at a series of pop - up liver health clinics , offering free @entity134 tests which help identify the early warning signs and practical advice about how to love your liver			2
' however , we can only reach a very small group of people and we 're appealing for the government to do more			0
