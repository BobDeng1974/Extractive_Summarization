published : 06:20 est , 17 may 2013 updated : 06:39 est , 17 may 2013 @entity0 was rushed to hospital with excruciating pain on her right hand side a woman who underwent surgery on one of her kidneys was stunned to be told by doctors she had actually had four of them			1
@entity0 , 20 , was rushed to hospital after she developed excruciating pain on her right side			1
just weeks earlier , her gp had diagnosed a urine infection , prescribing her antibiotics			1
but scans at @entity17 's @entity16 revealed what doctors first thought was a 17cm cyst on her right kidney			1
then 11 days later , further tests showed @entity0 actually had two kidneys on her right side , the second of which was the ' cyst ' - and was so damaged it would have to be removed			1
but during the operation , surgeons discovered yet another kidney , meaning @entity0 had four and the ' extremely rare ' privilege of having double the amount			1
after having the damaged kidney removed in june last year , @entity0 is now raising money for @entity36			1
she said she had a lot to thank her housemate @entity38 for , who first rushed her to hospital			0
she said : ' at first i did n't know how to feel because i had been told so many things			0
' now it 's quite fun watching how people react when you tell them that you 've got an extra kidney			2
' i suppose it 's weird not knowing what 's going on inside your body until something happens			0
' the upside of the whole thing is that i do n't get as bad hangovers as my friends , which is perhaps down to my extra kidneys			2
overall i have come out of this as a stronger person			0
' it was a difficult experience but i was looked after and i 've come through it the other end and looking forward to the future			0
' scans revealed she actually had four kidneys , one of which was so damaged it had to be surgically removed consultant urological surgeon @entity69 said : ' having three kidneys on a single side of the body is exceptionally rare			1
there are perhaps fewer than 100 cases described in textbooks and papers			0
' @entity0 's mother , @entity77 , 45 , raced down to @entity17 from @entity78 when she heard her daughter had been rushed to hospital			2
@entity77 said doctors drained more than 2,000ml of infected fluid from the damaged third kidney - which was unable to drain because it was damaged			1
she said : ' @entity85 had never been ill before this			0
because this kidney was so badly stretched and damaged by the infection , the consultant urologist informed @entity85 that the only solution was to have it removed			1
' he said he would try to save the lower kidney but prepared her in case both of them had to be removed			2
' as you can imagine there were lots of tears all round but we were just thankful that they had managed to stop her going into septic shock			0
' @entity0 ( right ) with her best friend and housemate @entity103 , who she credits with saving her life after the operation on june 11 @entity0 made a full recovery and is looking forward to finding out her degree results			2
@entity77 said : ' @entity85 was placed on the enhanced recovery programme and in true ' @entity110 ' she charmed and delighted everyone with her recovery			0
' the nurses called her " smiler "			0
three days after having a major organ removed , she was discharged			2
