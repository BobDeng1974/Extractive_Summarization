@entity0 win : former @entity2 it boss @entity1 has successfully argued he was unfairly dismissed by the corporation over a failed £ 100m project a @entity2 manager who ran a botched it project that cost the licence fee payer £ 100million was unfairly dismissed because the corporation plotted to blame him when it was scrapped , an employment tribunal has found			1
@entity1 , who was paid a salary of £ 280,000 , said he was made a ' scapegoat ' and sacked in a ' stitch - up ' over the expensive failure last year			2
the tribunal panel criticised the @entity2 's ' culture and climate ' that involved ' the steering of the spotlight of blame in other directions '			1
the corporation sacked him claiming he should be treated the same as a ' manager of a relegated football team ' , but a tribunal decided today this decision was ' cavalier '			1
the @entity2 had ploughed £ 125.9 million into the scheme he managed - an attempt to create an integrated digital production and archiving system			0
but it was scrapped by current director - general @entity34 in his first weeks in the job leaving a net cost of £ 98.4 million			1
it could now face a payout of as much as £ 100,000 after the tribunal verdict			1
the central @entity41 tribunal said mr @entity1 's claim he was unfairly dismissed was ' well - founded ' , but added that he had ' contributed ' to his dismissal as well			2
it rejected two other complaints he made against the corporation			0
a @entity2 spokesman said it had been ' a very difficult set of circumstances ' for the corporation			0
he said : ' we had a major failure of a significant project , and we had lost confidence - as the tribunal acknowledges - in @entity1			0
at the time we believed we acted appropriately			0
' the tribunal has taken a different view - we are disappointed with the outcome , but nevertheless we will learn lessons from the judgment and we 're grateful to staff who were involved in dealing with a very difficult case			0
' failed project : mr @entity1 was in charge of an £ 100m project scrapped by director general @entity34 mr @entity1 told the hearing that after leaving one meeting about his future , he was told by the @entity2 's head of strategy , @entity68 , that the procedure leading up to his dismissal in july 2013 was ' a stitch up '			1
it also heard from the @entity2 's then head of communications @entity75 that mr @entity1 was ' arguably ' a scapegoat , but he added that ' is not the way i would characterise it '			2
in one , a @entity2 boss , @entity81 , said mr @entity1 could ' just spin in the wind ' while mr @entity83 could ' position yourself as the man who took it over , reviewed it and called time '			2
the tribunal said the emails represented a ' culture and climate ' that involved ' the steering of the spotlight of blame in other directions , on the part of those who felt themselves to be in danger of association with a sinking ship '			2
evidence : the @entity2 , which is based at @entity103 in @entity41 , pictured , made mr @entity1 a scapegoat it refused to accept the @entity2 's claim that ' this case was broadly analogous to ... the manager of a relegated football team ' and said some @entity110 staff behaved at times with ' a cavalier disregard for any of the accepted norms of a fair disciplinary process ' by not giving mr @entity1 enough time to study some of the evidence used against him			1
the tribunal 's report revealed mr @entity1 was paid a ' sign - on bonus ' of £ 140,000 on top of his salary within 18 months of starting work at the @entity2 in 2009			1
the tribunal ruling is another expensive footnote to the @entity126 fiasco , which experts predict could cost the corporation another £ 100,000			0
@entity129 , a partner in employment law at @entity131 , told @entity132 : ' his maximum compensation would be £ 74,200 assuming he was dismissed before 6 april 2014			0
' on top of that , he may also have a claim for his notice - for which he could also recover £ 25,000 in an @entity0			0

the ' culture and climate ' at the top of the @entity2 has been criticised
@entity1 fired because bosses argued his position was the same as a ' relegated football manager ' - a decision *branded* ' cavalier '
director general @entity34 scrapped it project in his first weeks in charge
but employment tribunal *agreed* with argument he was sacked in ' stitch up '
mr @entity1 said @entity2 bosses plotted to sack him and make him ' scapegoat '
@entity157 said management ' steered the spotlight of blame in other directions '
@entity2 could face payout of as much as £ 100,000 after unfair dismissal verdict
