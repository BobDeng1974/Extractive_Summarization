by @entity1 reporter published : 12:03 est , 19 september 2012 updated : 12:20 est , 19 september 2012 historical experts have poured cold water over claims that an ancient papyrus proves @entity6 was married to @entity7 , describing the fragment as ' suspicious ' and ' a forgery '			1
the antique attracted worldwide attention because of a bombshell phrase written in @entity14 coptic that says @entity6 refers to @entity7 as ' my wife ' when speaking to his disciples			1
the 8cm by 4cm fragment supports an undercurrent in @entity22 thought that undermines centuries of @entity25 dogma by suggesting the @entity26 was not celibate			2
two lines later he then tells the disciples : ' i dwell with her			2
' but historical experts at a @entity13 conference in @entity39 today began to dismiss the papyrus			1
@entity41 , professor of @entity42 at the @entity43 , was on the international advisory panel that reviewed the 2006 discovery of the @entity46			2
he said the text accurately quotes @entity6 as saying ' my wife ' , but added : ' there 's something about this fragment in its appearance and also in the grammar of the @entity13 that strikes me as being not completely convincing somehow			1
' @entity56 papyrologist @entity57 declared , simply : ' i would say it 's a forgery			2
the script does n't look authentic			0
' @entity61 - @entity60 , a @entity13 linguist , said the fragment can not be judged as it has no context and dismissed it as ' suspicious '			0
he explained : ' there are thousands of scraps of papyrus where you find crazy things			0
' the incomplete manuscript , written in the ancient @entity14 coptic language , has been studied by @entity74 , @entity76 professor of divinity at @entity77 , the oldest endowed academic seat in the @entity79			1
today , @entity74 acknowledged there were unanswered questions about the fragment , and said she planned to carry out ink tests to determine its authenticity			0
she said : ' we still have some work to do , testing the ink and so on and so forth , but what is exciting about this fragment is that it 's the first case we have of @entity94 claiming that @entity6 had a wife			1
' ancient : the back side , or verso , of the papyrus is so badly damaged that only a few key words - ' my mother ' and ' three ' - were decipherable @entity74 also made the point that the text does not offer any historical evidence of @entity6 being married , merely that some @entity94 believed he was 200 years after he died			1
she also revealed that the owner of the papyrus wants to sell it - prompting further speculation over its authenticity			0
' there are all sorts of really dodgy things about this , ' said @entity116 , professor of archaeological heritage at @entity117 and author of the @entity120 blog , which closely follows the illicit trade in antiquities			1
' this looks to me as if any sensible , responsible academic would keep their distance from it			0
' ancient papyrus fragments have been frequently cut up by unscrupulous dealers seeking to make more money			2
@entity132 cited the ongoing debate in academia over publishing articles about possibly dubiously obtained antiquities , thus potentially fueling the illicit market			0
however , if genuine , the document casts doubt on a centuries old official representation of @entity7 as a repentant whore and overturns the @entity22 ideal of sexual abstinence			1
it elaborates an ancient and persistent undercurrent in @entity22 thought that @entity6 and @entity7 were in fact a couple , as picked up by @entity148 in the plot of his best - selling thriller @entity150			1
professor @entity74 downplays the fragment 's validity as a biographical document , saying that it was probably composed in @entity154 a century or so after the @entity155 , then subsequently transcribed into @entity13			2
its significance instead lies in the possibility that an early @entity22 sect drew spiritual succour from portraying their prophet as having a wife			2
this representation of @entity6 as a man with earthly passions and needs has not survived in the doctrines of the established churches , which emphasise celibacy and asceticism as a spiritual ideal			1
professor @entity74 's interpretation of the text are based on the assumption that the fragment is genuine , a question that is by no means definitively settled			0
the papyrus ’ back side , or verso , is so badly damaged that only a few key words - ' my mother ' and ' three ' - were decipherable , but on the front side , or recto , @entity74 gleaned eight fragmentary lines : because chemical tests of its ink have not yet been done , the papyrus could still be challenged on the basis of its authenticity , though independent experts have given their support based on other benchmarks			2
to authenticate the papyrus , professor @entity74 sent photos of it to @entity199 , a professor at @entity200 and an authority on @entity13 papyri and sacred scriptures			0
professor @entity199 forwarded the pictures to @entity205 , a renowned papyrologist who directs the @entity206 at @entity207			0
known for his conservative assessments of the authenticity and date of ancient papyri , professor @entity205 nevertheless confirmed that he believed the document was genuine			1
the scribe 's dialect and style of handwriting , and the colour and texture of the papyrus , helped them to date it to the second half of the fourth century @entity221 and place its probable origin in upper @entity223			0
the details of the fragment support another view of the life of @entity6 that has begun to gain traction since the discovery of a cache of ancient manuscripts in @entity232 , @entity223 , in 1945			1
these manuscripts , including the gospel of @entity235 , the gospel of @entity237 and the @entity238 , outline the so - called @entity240 version of @entity22 which differs sharply from the official @entity25 line			0
@entity26 appearing to the @entity242 by @entity243 : a newly discovered ancient papyrus suggests the @entity246 and @entity7 were man and wife @entity248 is a modern scholarly term for a set of esoteric religious beliefs found among early @entity22 groups who believed the realisation of intuitive knowledge is the way to salvation			1
in general , they believed that the material world was created not by @entity259 but via some intermediary being sometimes identified as @entity261 , @entity262 or @entity263			0
@entity6 is identified by some @entity248 as an embodiment of the supreme being who became incarnate to bring gnōsis to the earth , according to @entity269			1
others deny that @entity6 was @entity259 made flesh , claiming him merely to be a human who reached divinity through enlightenment and taught his disciples to do the same			1
the movement spread in areas controlled by the @entity278 and @entity279 , and the @entity280 ; it continued to develop in the @entity281 and @entity282 before and during the 2nd and 3rd centuries			0
conversion to @entity285 and the @entity286 ( 1209 – 1229 ) greatly reduced the remaining number of @entity248 during the @entity288 , though a few communities still exist			0
@entity240 and pseudo-gnostic ideas became influential in some of the philosophies of various esoteric mystical movements of the late 19th and 20th centuries in @entity294 and @entity295			0
persecuted and often cut off from each other , ancient @entity22 communities had very different opinions on fundamental doctrines regarding @entity6 ' birth , life and death			1
it was only with the establishment of @entity22 as the state religion of the @entity278 that the @entity306 summoned 300 bishops to issue a definitive statement of @entity22 doctrine			0
this so - called @entity310 - named for @entity311 , the town where they met - affirmed a model of @entity22 belief that is to this day taken as orthodoxy			0
the origins of this latest fragment are as yet unknown			0
professor @entity74 received it from an anonymous collector who had found it among a job lot of ancient @entity154 and @entity13 papyri			2
accompanying the fragment was an unsigned and undated handwritten note from a translator claiming it is the sole example of a text in which @entity6 refers in direct speech to having a wife			1
professor @entity74 , who is able to read ancient @entity13 , believes some of the phrases within the text echo passages in @entity332 , @entity333 and the @entity240 gospels about the role of the family			2
these parallels convinced her that this account of the life of @entity6 was originally composed in the second century @entity221 when such questions were a subject of intense theological debate			1
those who disagreed with the official line as established by the @entity311 were in time branded by the @entity25 as heretics and their teachings suppressed .			0

ancient document attracted worldwide attention because of a phrase that says @entity6 refers to @entity7 as his wife
experts criticise its appearance and grammar , with one calling it ' dodgy '
