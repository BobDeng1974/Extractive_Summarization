you might want to think twice the next time you put some bacon under the grill			2
a video has revealed just how smart pigs are , which may leave some people a little more reluctant to tuck into a choice cut of pig			1
the latest evidence of the creature 's intelligence shows a pig sorting shapes without any human intervention			1
@entity16 the pig in @entity18 , @entity15 has solved a complex puzzle			1
the pig did it without any help from a human			1
in a video ( shown ) the pig puts coloured shapes into a wooden block			1
recent research also revealed they have empathy like humans the video was recorded by @entity33 , who lives in @entity18 , @entity15			1
in a video , @entity16 the pig places coloured pig - shaped blocks in corresponding coloured holes on a wooden board			1
the pig does this using its mouth , without any help			1
‘ animals are an important part of our society , ’ said ms von @entity33			2
the sign of pig intelligence follows research earlier this year when scientists discovered that the creatures may be capable of empathy - a characteristic thought to be almost uniquely human			1
in an elaborate experiment , experts discovered that pigs shared the stress and happiness of their penmates			2
this findings by @entity60 in the @entity61 suggest that swine respond to each other ’s feelings , and adds weight to the argument that the practice of separating the animals in farms is especially cruel			2
the pigs were trained either to anticipate happiness or distress , by playing them music and either rewarding them with a pleasant treat such as chocolate raisins and a roomy house filled with peat , or putting them in a stressful situation , such as keeping them in isolation in a small pen			2
@entity86 , ‘ naïve ’ pigs were placed in a pen with a pig conditioned to expect happiness , or one that expected discomfort			1
all the pigs were then played the same music – a piece by @entity94 - used in training			2
some of the trained pigs showed that they anticipated what may happen to them , either by displaying happy behaviours - such as wagging their tails and barking - or signs of stress , such as keeping their ears back , urinating and defecating			2
despite most of the trained pigs failing to react at all , they were still taken to another pen , leaving the naïve pigs behind , and were either rewarded or punished , depending on their training			0
the naïve pigs , which could not have known what lay in store for their penmates , reacted to the trained pigs ’ behaviour anyway			0
asian elephants show concern for others when they are stressed , using their trunks to caress the suffering elephant and emit a soft ' chirp , ' @entity113 recently reported			0
consoling elephants put their trunk into another elephant 's mouth so they are vulnerable , perhaps showing they are there to help			0
crows and ravens are also known to be emotionally intelligent , with researchers at the @entity128 in @entity129 finding that the birds comfort others that are stressed after a fight			0
ravens sit next to the distressed bird so their bodies are touching and sometimes preen it			0
@entity138 research has shown that orangutans ( stock image ) can be so full of empathy that they take on the moods of others			1
when one orangutan laughs , others often join in scrub jays - another member of the @entity150 family - have ' funerals ' for deceased friends , according to research by the @entity153			1
they fly over the dead body , wailing and screeching , which may be a sign of grief			0
mice have been shown to detect pain among others but only appear to console their family and friends			0
@entity163 , an assistant professor at @entity164 , said : ' mice are capable of a more complex form of empathy than we ever believed possible			1
' similarly , rats are believed to be able to respond to excitement , fear and anger			0
they even help each other out with no prospect of a reward , according to @entity176			0
the rodents also show that they enjoy being tickled and playing by giggling			0
gorillas not only care for each other but have even been seen to care for dolls			0
@entity138 research has shown that orangutans can be so full of empathy that they take on the moods of others			1
when one orangutan laughs , others often join in			0
the sign of pig intelligence follows research earlier this year when scientists discovered that the creatures may be capable of empathy - a characteristic thought to be almost uniquely human			1
in an elaborate experiment , experts discovered that pigs shared the stress and happiness of their penmates for example , when a trained pig showed it was stressed , a naïve pig acted in the same way , by becoming more alert and keeping its ears back			1
the behaviour was even more noticeable when the untrained animals noticed the behaviour of trained ‘ happy ’ pigs , with the animals becoming more playful and wagging their tails			0
to test that the animals were responding to each other ’s behaviour and not simply the music , the scientists played the naïve pigs the tune			0
they showed no signs of changing their behaviour , indicating they were showing empathy with the trained animals			2
the findings were published in the journal @entity225 .			0
