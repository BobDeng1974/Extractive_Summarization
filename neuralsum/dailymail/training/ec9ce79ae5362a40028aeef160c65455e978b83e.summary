third place went to the woman who moaned because she was n’t sent a text prompting her to remember her passport			0
and one couple were miffed when the captain ignored their note saying they would be back two hours later than departure time – and left without them			0
a young woman on a @entity38 cruise heard @entity3 had once been on her boat – and demanded to know why she had n’t seen him			2

@entity73 , from bonvoyage.co.uk , said : ‘ the vast majority of feedback we get from holidaymakers is hugely positive , telling us what a great time they had , but from time to time we come across a few quirky complaints that we can do little to help			0
‘ whilst we make sure we go back to every complaint , i ’m afraid we ca n’t be held responsible for the sea being too loud or the lack of celebrities – as much as we wish we could put @entity3 on every cruise ! ’			2
