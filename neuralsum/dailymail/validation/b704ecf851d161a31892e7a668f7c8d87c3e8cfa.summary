' while you up here planning weddings this b * * * * up here planning how to steal everything you got , which is everything i 've got and i 'm not gon na let that happen			0

i am not a treacherous person @entity0 but you - you ! - you have twisted my love and made it some awful thing			1
' @entity0 appeared to be at his weakest when he pleaded with her : ' i 'm scared - i 'm dying			2
you have to understand that when a man in my position says please it means something			0
' as she expected him to beg her to stay , he instead said : ' please , i need to know what you planned with @entity15 so i can fix this			0
' heated conversation : @entity117 and @entity11 angrily shouted at each other after she stormed out ' yeah , when a man like you says please it means something - it means you 're lying , ' she shouted back angrily			2

@entity204 hit back at his dad insisting the only ' sexual proclivity ' that has got them in trouble was ' the fact that you ca n't manage to simply keep it in your pants '			2
but @entity0 's ignorance was so strong he continually ignored the fact that @entity204 had opened the doors to signing @entity221 sensation @entity220 , a far bigger star than the artists @entity0 was fighting to maintain			2

cookie also showed her dedication - taking part in a drinking competition just to keep another artist from leaving			2
things appeared to be looking up by the end , with @entity0 waking up and going along with @entity204 to sign @entity254 - and even taking over a nightclub piano to sing his old hit , you 're so beautiful , with his son and their new signing			1
learning fast : @entity237 showed that he has picked up some of his family sly tricks they were then joined mid-song by @entity262 , a clear sign that the initial crisis may have passed			0
