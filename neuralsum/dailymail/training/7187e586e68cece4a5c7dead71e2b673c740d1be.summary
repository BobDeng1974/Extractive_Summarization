by @entity0 published : 11:05 est , 24 april 2013 updated : 03:50 est , 25 april 2013 a man who spent £ 30,000 on dozens of failed hair transplant operations was left so self - conscious he refused to let his girlfriend touch his hair for a full six months after they got together			1
despite dating @entity9 , 35 , regularly , @entity6 , 37 , from @entity7 , @entity8 , managed to keep his botched attempts at hair transplants a secret			1
@entity6 , who started losing his hair at just 21 avoided telling his future wife that he was spending thousands of pounds on hair transplants - all of which failed to work - until they were about to move in together			1
@entity9 put her partner 's hatred of having his hair touched down to vanity			1
' i did n't want to tell her because i was embarrassed			2
i was self - conscious and lacked confidence			2
it was my achilles heel , ' he says			0
@entity6 after a successful transplant and ( right ) with wife @entity9 on their wedding day @entity6 , who began to go bald at the age of 21 , says the decision to have a hair transplant was a last resort			1
' when i started to lose my hair , i attempted to salvage it over the course of several months , ' said @entity6			1
' i tried everything - wigs , treatments , all lotions and potions , but the hair loss continued			1
it affected me hugely emotionally			0
' as a result , @entity6 began suffering from mild depression			1
he felt isolated , did n't want to go out and constantly wore a hat			0
he says it was on his mind ' every minute of every day '			0
finally @entity6 made the decision to try a hair transplant			1
while he was travelling through @entity49 a glamorous - looking advert for hair restoration caught his eye and he thought , ' this could be the answer '			2
he went for it , full of hope , but the results were less than ideal			0
not much hair grew back and the hair that did , did not look natural			2
he now says he felt he had been misled by the salesman			0
but lack of knowledge and information at the time meant @entity6 went back to the same surgeon a further three times after the initial poor outcome			1
@entity6 pictured before his corrective surgery ( left ) and immediately after a successful hair operation ( right ) two years later and £ 30,000 poorer and his hairline was in no better state - in fact he needed corrective surgery to fix what had been done because it looked unnatural			1
the surgery he opted to have done was , at the time , perceived as good and state of art - there was no internet around to check what he should expect and no easily accessible experts to speak to			2
after the four procedures of mini and micro grafts hair transplants @entity6 was left with unnatural - looking clumps of hair along hairline			1
worse still , @entity6 felt he had to face the struggle alone			1
he had met @entity9 when the two were travelling and she had no idea he was suffering from hair loss			2
but when they were about to buy their first home together , @entity6 told her he needed to talk to her about something serious			1
@entity9 says : ' i had no idea what he we going to tell me and having just put the deposit down on a house , i was worried he was going to tell me it was all over or he 'd met someone else			0
' the first thing he did was reassure me that he was n't about to finish with me , then he told me the whole story - that he 'd started losing his hair in his late teens , had undergone lots of botched operations costing thousands of pounds and was , at the time , having extensive restorative treatment in @entity111			2
' my first instinct was relief			0
it all made sense - @entity6 's hatred of me touching his hair , his frequent trips to @entity111 which he told me were to see a friend			1
at the time i had no reason to think he was lying - he did have a friend in the city and i thought he just liked styling his hair in a particular way			2
' every time i tried to touch his hair he 'd push my hand away			2
' @entity6 waited until his relationship with @entity9 had properly developed before letting her in on his biggest secret			1
only my mother and sister knew , ' he said			0
' but even though it 's something very sensitive to me , @entity9 needed to know when our relationship started getting a lot more serious and we were getting a lot closer			0
' two years after his confession , the couple got engaged			0
a year later they were married and they now have a beautiful pair of five - year - old twins , @entity142 and @entity143			0
but @entity9 says his confession rattled her at first			0
' after the initial relief his confession began to hit home , the worry started to settle in , ' said @entity9			0
@entity6 waited until his relationship with @entity9 had evolved before letting her in on his biggest secret ' what damage was this doing to his scalp ? how much treatment could he take ? if it failed , what would the impact be ? and how was this all affecting him mentally ? ' in terms of the money he was spending , it did n't bother me at all ' , said @entity9			1
' @entity6 's always worked hard and it was cash he 'd earned			1
i understood that this was something really personal to him , and whilst on the outside he exuded confidence , deep down his self - esteem was really low and restoring his hair would bring the confidence back			1
' i was by his side to support him during each new round of surgery and thankfully , it all went well			2
' each time though , my heart did sink and the old fears would come back - about it failing and harming him physically and mentally			0
@entity6 was self - conscious of the unnatural results his saviour came in the form of @entity111 surgeon dr @entity178 who performed a brilliant procedure to fix his hairline for good			1
@entity6 since launched his website @entity182 , offering what he says is ' honest , ethical hair loss help from hair loss treatments to hair transplants '			1
' when @entity6 had finished his last round of surgery i was so pleased it was over and amazed at how he looked , ' @entity9 says			1
' @entity190 for the first time would have no idea what he 's been through			0
i felt delighted for him			0
' this is what @entity6 had been searching for , for years			1
overnight his self - confidence and belief in himself improved and he became a different , more self - assured person			2
' we only started telling friends a couple of years ago			0
they have been incredibly supportive , he 's had the banter you 'd expect from close mates , but no negativity at all			0
' in fact we 've found some wanting to talk to us about the whole process because they 're thinking of having the same treatment			0
' i 'm really proud of @entity6 and the journey he 's been on			1
' he 's a more confident and relaxed person now than when we first met and feels comfortable in his own skin			0
' now he 's come out and people know about the hair loss , he feels as though a big burden has been lifted			2
he is n't hiding anymore - he 's proud of who he is			0
the couple are now married			0
they now have a beautiful pair of five - year - old twins , @entity142 and @entity143			0

@entity6 , 37 , spent £ 30,000 having corrective surgery on hairline
had *multiple* treatments that left him with unnatural looking hair
@entity6 , from @entity8 , suffered depression and confidence issues
