by @entity0 published : 16:47 est , 8 april 2013 updated : 02:18 est , 9 april 2013 risky behavior : a new study shows that 27.3per cent of skin cancer survivors in the @entity4 never wear sunscreen outdoors more than one in four people who have had skin cancer do not wear sunscreen , a new study has reported			1
the survey , undertaken by the @entity11 , found that among those who have had melanoma - the fifth deadliest cancer for men and the seventh for women - 27.3per cent said they never use sunscreen			1
even more shocking , 2.1per cent admitted that they still use tanning beds , which have been linked to skin cancer in several past studies			1
the research was based on the results of a 2010 national health interview survey involving 27,120 @entity4			0
while 35.4per cent of the general population said they never use sunscreen , over a quarter of skin cancer survivors said the same			1
and even though survivors were more likely to stay in the shade than those with no history of melanoma , the results were still surprising			2
dr @entity38 , an associate professor of surgery at the @entity40 and the author of the study , was shocked at her findings			1
' we expected melanoma survivors to be extraordinarily protective since we know sunlight exposure and tanning increases the risk of a second melanoma , ' she told @entity51			2
on the contrary , 15.4per cent reported that they rarely or never sit in the shade when outdoors for more than in hour			1
melanoma cases are on the rise , according to the @entity58 , which reported that incidences increased 800per cent among young women in the period from 1970 to 2009			2
@entity62 also estimates that 76,690 new cases will be diagnosed , and 9,480 @entity4 will die of melanoma this year alone			2
the growing number of cases is due to many factors - one of which , says dr @entity68 , medical oncologist at @entity69 in @entity70 , @entity71 , is society 's perception that a tan is a sign of health and attractiveness			0
' there is a fairly large emphasis on beauty in this country , ' he told the news website			0
' tanning is a reflection of good health , too - the @entity71 lifestyle , you wonder if people know the dangers but choose to ignore them			0
' dr. @entity90 , a clinical assistant professor at @entity91 , agrees with this standpoint , noting that statistics seem to point to the fact that people are not being informed of the risks involved in unprotected sunbathing			0
' we know that sunlight exposure and tanning increases the risk of a second melanoma ' ' we need to do a better job of educating people , ' said dr @entity90 , explaining that if melanoma is caught early , it is ' essentially curable '			2
he believes that people who continue to tan even after a skin cancer diagnosis are perhaps addicted to sunshine			1
' people can be hooked on tanning , ' he explained			0
' @entity109 can have a euphoric effect on the brain like other addictive substances			0
' indeed , dr @entity38 notes that in a similar vein , some lung cancer survivors continue to smoke even after diagnosis since they are addicted to the nicotine			1
on the other hand , perennial sunbathers could also be satisfying an instinctive desire for vitamin d , says dr @entity122 , head of dermatology at @entity124			0
but according dr @entity125 , a clinical psychologist and chairman of psychology at the @entity128 in @entity129 , @entity130 , the reason behind this phenomenon is that people who have been diagnosed with skin cancer experience a sense of resignation			1
' they say : " i already got it , what other harm can it do ? " ' he explains - an untrue notion , since a person with a melanoma is nine times more likely to develop a second skin cancer			1
in any case , the findings are certainly disturbing			0
' they say something about @entity4 society , and you wonder if patients have been properly counseled , ' said dr @entity68 .			0

according to a new study , 27.3per cent of people who have had the skin cancer say they never use sunscreen when outdoors for more than an hour
dr @entity38 , the author of the study , said skin cancer *sufferers* are nine times more likely to develop a second melanoma
