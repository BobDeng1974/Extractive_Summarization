this was just the second time in three years @entity3 manager @entity2 has dared to venture to the @entity4 , but on the evidence of this sour stalemate he will not be back			2
it was n’t only the @entity3 contenders – @entity11 and @entity12 - who failed to impress , every player on the pitch was as desperate as the next			0
referee @entity13 and his assistants were equally inept , failing to send off @entity16 ’s @entity15 early in the game and later denying @entity18 a legitimate goal			1
@entity18 's @entity20 ( right ) went down under a challenge from defender @entity15 ( left ) in the fifth minute @entity22 ( centre ) had a goal ruled out for offside for @entity18 against @entity16 in the first half @entity18 players felt @entity15 ( third right ) of @entity16 could have been sent off for a foul on striker @entity20 @entity18 's @entity30 ( right ) and @entity22 ( second left ) were incensed at the decision made by @entity13 ( centre ) but despite appearing to be the last man for @entity16 , @entity15 ( left ) was only booked by referee @entity13 ( centre ) @entity18 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity35 6 , @entity37 ( @entity36 , 88 ) 4 , @entity38 6 , @entity39 6 , @entity40 6 , @entity41 4,5 ( @entity42 , 68 , 6 ) , @entity43 6 , @entity30 5 , @entity22 5.5 , @entity12 5 , @entity20 5 ( @entity44 , 68 ) , 5			1

booked : @entity15 , @entity53 manager : @entity69 referee : @entity13 4 att : 40 , 943 @entity71 : @entity52 the @entity73 table after saturday 's @entity73 game @entity43 worked tirelessly in midfield for @entity18 , as his heat map shows in our brillant @entity77 but for @entity2 , it was a wasted trip			1
or perhaps not , for neither @entity16 frontman @entity11 nor @entity80 – bidding for a recall having returned to the @entity73 in january – did anything to suggest they are more deserving of inclusion ahead of the likes of @entity86			1
it was a contest – if you can call it that – low on entertainment and quality			0
indeed , @entity69 ’ @entity16 barely mustered an effort on goal			1
the draw – @entity18 ’s 13th of the @entity73 season - has done little to ease the pressure on @entity18 boss @entity51 , who this week penned an open letter to the fans asking for their support			2
but the @entity99 did have reason to moan about some first - half refereeing			2
the game was just five minutes old when @entity43 sprung @entity20 clear on the shoulder of @entity15 and , under what appeared minimal contact from the recovering defender , the striker flopped to the turf			1
referee @entity13 looked to have made the right call when waving play on , only for assistant @entity112 to flag for an infringement			0
@entity15 , then , would surely have to go			2
@entity13 , though , perhaps doubting the advice of his assistant , opted to show yellow			0
it was a weak decision			0
from the resulting free - kick @entity30 whipped into the side - netting @entity18 striker @entity42 ( second left ) turns the ball goalwards but it did not hit the back of the net for his team against @entity16 @entity30 slides in strongly to win the ball for @entity18 in their game against @entity16 @entity18 increased their pressure after @entity51 made a double substitution with @entity42 and @entity44 going on @entity131 ( left ) of @entity16 tussles for possession with his midfield counterpart @entity30 ( right ) of @entity18 what followed was 20 minutes of scrap and tedium , only broken when a @entity131 mistake presented the hosts with a chance to break			1
@entity12 fed @entity41 and he cut infield before lashing narrowly wide with his left boot			2
@entity12 then took aim from a narrow angle but failed to defy it and smashed across goal and wide			2
@entity146 and his team were again the centre of attention when disallowing @entity22 ’s goal on the stroke of half - time			1
@entity41 crossed to the far post where the winger – played onside by @entity53 – controlled before dashing across the six - yard box and toeing in			0
there was still time for @entity30 to test the palms of @entity52 30 yards as @entity18 finished the half on the front foot			1
the home fans did respond to @entity51 ’s call for support after the break but such enthusiasm was not a result of anything they ’d witnessed on the pitch			0
it was n’t until the 62nd minute that full - back @entity37 flashed wide a header from @entity30 ’s corner			1
the @entity174 , unmarked eight yards out , should have scored			0
@entity51 reacted by bringing on strike pairing @entity44 and @entity42 and the latter soon carved a chance for @entity12 , but he shot wide			2
@entity30 ( left ) of @entity18 and @entity178 ( right ) of @entity16 challenge for the ball @entity16 striker @entity181 ( centre ) has been in good form of late and @entity38 ( left ) of @entity18 paid him close attention @entity12 ( left ) of @entity18 holds off the challenge @entity56 ( right ) , the @entity16 midfielder @entity18 's @entity30 ( left ) tries his luck with a free kick against @entity16 at the @entity4 on saturday @entity40 of @entity18 rues a missed chance as his team failed to score against @entity16 @entity15 , who escaped a red card in an early incident , steps across to stifle an attack by @entity18 's @entity40 @entity146 and his team were again the centre of attention when disallowing @entity22 ’s goal on the stroke of half - time			1
@entity41 crossed to the far post where the winger – played onside by @entity53 – controlled before dashing across the six - yard box and toeing in			0

@entity18 defender @entity39 ( left ) heads the ball away while under pressure from @entity16 striker @entity181 ( right ) @entity16 striker @entity11 ( left ) takes the ball away from @entity30 but was unable to score as the first half ended goalless @entity18 's @entity12 ( left ) clashed with @entity16 midfielder @entity58 ( right ) before @entity38 intervened ( centre ) @entity18 's @entity12 ( second left ) , a signing in the january transfer window , takes the ball away from @entity54 ( right ) @entity16 's captain @entity131 ( left ) controls the ball to keep it away from @entity18 midfielder @entity30 ( right ) @entity37 ( left ) wins a header against @entity11 ( centre ) of @entity16 as both teams failed to score @entity18 manager @entity51 ( right ) shares a joke alongside @entity16 manager @entity69 before the game @entity42 himself was then denied by @entity52 ’s instinctive save after darting to the near post to connect with @entity22 ’s flag - kick			1
and that was where the incident finished , some 20 minutes from time			0
as for @entity2 , he was soon long gone			0
we do n’t expect to see him again .			0

@entity16 's @entity15 was booked for a fifth minute foul on @entity20 , despite appearing as the last man
@entity37 headed wide with a free header for @entity18 from a corner in the 62nd minute
attacker @entity22 had a goal *wrongly* ruled out for offside for @entity18 in the first half
