' we will not accept being treated as second - rate citizens ' : @entity3 premier @entity2 slammed moves to restrict benefits to migrant workers @entity3 's prime minister has told @entity8 not to treat @entity3 as ' second - rate citizens ' when curbs on @entity3 and @entity12 workers are lifted on january 1			1
@entity2 said last night that research showed no evidence that there would be large numbers of migrants moving from his country to the @entity8 , despite mounting fears			1
and he reiterated the claim , made elsewhere , that @entity3 were more likely to seek work in southern @entity24 states like @entity25 and @entity26 , where the language is far more similar to @entity3			1
@entity28 this week announced measures to toughen welfare rules for migrants from the @entity32 amid concern that migrants from @entity3 and @entity12 would exploit the benefits system			1
he has claimed that one million people from @entity37 and @entity38 are living in @entity8 with migration at a level not seen since wartime			0
but , in a statement released last night , mr @entity2 slammed the move			0
he said people should be punished for abusing the welfare system , but restrictions should not be used to ' generate or justify abuse or discrimination '			1
' we will not accept being treated as second - rate citizens , ' mr @entity2 said , adding that research showed ' there is no reason for concern regarding a migrant wave ' from @entity3 to @entity8			1
millions of @entity3 had already chosen to work abroad in ' southern @entity57 states ' , referring to @entity26 and @entity25 which have a @entity57 - based language like @entity3			2
he said he hoped @entity28 was not trying ' to attack the fundamental principles of the @entity32 , among which the freedom of movement is one of the most important values '			0
mr @entity28 's benefits proposals were criticised on wednesday by @entity24 employment commissioner @entity65 as an ' unfortunate over-reaction '			0
warning that @entity8 risked becoming the ' nasty country of @entity38 , he said plans to curb benefits for migrants were were fuelling ‘ hysteria ’ and accused the pm of distorting the truth about immigration			2
‘ the point is that the @entity8 has not been given all the truth and the full truth about this subject , ' mr @entity65 told @entity80 's today programme			0
@entity81 is facing a growing revolt over its no - borders immigration policy , with @entity84 and @entity85 also suggesting they want curbs on @entity32 migrants ’ rights			0
mr @entity28 , who has been criticised for refusing to give an estimate of how many @entity3 and @entity12 will come to @entity8 next year , has outlined plans to limit the rights of temporary workers to housing benefit , and a 12 - month bar on those fund begging and sleeping rough			1
the measures were announced shortly after the @entity98 published the results of a poll which suggests that four in five @entity8 do not want unrestricted access to the @entity8 for @entity3 and @entity12			1
' hysteria ' : @entity24 employment commissioner @entity65 criticised benefits curbs for migrants announced by @entity28 this week , accusing the prime minister of distorting the truth about immigration home secretary @entity108 this week suggested moves to cap the number of @entity32 migrants to the @entity8 in order to stop @entity8 workers languishing on the dole			2
writing for the @entity116 website , mrs may suggested that the government ’s attempts to make the @entity8 a less attractive destination - by restricting access to welfare and introducing an annual levy for use of the @entity122 - were likely to have limited effect			2
‘ in all honesty , whatever the government does in terms of reducing the pull factors that draw people to @entity8 , as long as there is such an enormous disparity between @entity32 member states in terms of income per head , there will be an overwhelming incentive for people to move from poorer member states to richer member states , ’ she said			0
mrs may added : ‘ that not only puts pressure on communities in countries like @entity8 , it robs poorer @entity32 member states of their most talented people			0
so in future , we must put in place new arrangements to slow full access to each other ’s labour markets until we can be sure it will not lead to mass migration			0

migrants from @entity3 and @entity12 free to work in @entity8 from january 1
but @entity2 says there is now evidence of ' migrant wave ' to @entity8
he says welfare restrictions should not be used to ' justify discrimination '
