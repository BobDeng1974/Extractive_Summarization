brain injury that occurs in the womb or early in a child 's growth could be the root cause of autism according to new research			1
a paper published just last month by dr. @entity8 , an associate professor of molecular biology and neuroscience at @entity11 , argues that damage to the cerebellum may contribute to autism spectrum disorders ( @entity15 ) and other neurodevelopmental disorders later in life			1
the cerebellum , dr. @entity8 theorizes , is responsible for helping young minds process complex sensory information , which , over time , eventually leads them to form normal social relationships			1
the cerebellum only makes up about 10 percent of the brain â€™s mass , and is mostly in charge of movement - related functions , such as coordination			0
early in a child 's life , however , dr. @entity8 makes the argument that the cerebellum has a much larger role , specifically as it pertains to social development			1
' some of the clinical and animal - research evidence for cerebellar involvement in autism has been known for years , ' dr. @entity8 says in an interview with @entity52			1
' but this evidence does n't fit into the textbook wisdom that the cerebellum controls sensory processing and movement			0
at some level , researchers have been trapped by whatever framework they learned in college or graduate school			0
' the paper gives the example of a child 's response to a parent 's smile			2
there is no reward to a smile , so the smile itself does not do anything to stimulate the parts of the brain that respond to rewards			0
over time however , the cerebellum begins to correlate seeing a parent smile with other rewards , such as being fed , and connects the areas of the brain that see the smile with those that signal rewards			0
should , however , a child have had any damage to the cerebellum in their formative years , they would be unable to make this connection between that part of the brain that sees the smile and that which triggers rewards , which would likely impair their social development			1
early damage to the cerebellum could also effect other ' downstream ' areas of the brain , such as those responsible for cognition , which would most likely inhibit normal development			1
findings : children with a cerebellar injury at birth have a likelihood of getting an @entity15 that is akin to that of a smoker developing lung cancer for a child known to have a cerebellar injury at birth , the paper reports an increased relative risk for an asd as equivalent to that of a smoker developing lung cancer			2
and while dr. @entity8 and his coauthors do not completely rule out injury during a child 's early life as a possible root of this disorder , they feel it is more likely an injury suffered in the womb that is the cause			1
' the research evidence is consistent with the idea that by birth , nearly all of the risk that leads to @entity15 has already occurred , ' dr. @entity8 says			2
' there is certainly the possibility of postnatal risks , but to my knowledge the evidence for this is weak , and can usually be explained by some prenatal event			0
' having identified what he believes to be the root , now dr. @entity8 hopes to move on to the next stage , and find better ways to treat the disorder			2
' in the case of autism , the early - life cerebellum might be a target for future intervention , ' he concludes his paper , which was published in the journal @entity155			2
' autism researchers have been hacking away at the genetics for years , but genes are a far cry from brain circuits			0
there 's such a gap between genes and child development			0
i hope our article can help bridge that gap			0

a new paper by dr. @entity8 , a professor at @entity11 , argues that damage to the cerebellum in the womb could be the root of autism
though most associate the cerebellum with motor skills , dr. @entity8 theorizes it plays a much larger role in a child 's early development
early brain injury has a major impact on how a child forms normal social relationships according to dr. @entity8
