by @entity0 the professor , an expert in how drugs affect the brain , says it should soon be possible to get drunk safely ¿ by consuming ¿ healthy alcohol ' @entity7 - free alcohol ? drunkenness that you can switch off with an antidote pill ? the controversial former government drugs adviser , professor @entity11 , has boasted that he is on the threshold of inventing what sounds like the answer to many a sandpaper - tongued sunday - morning lament			1
the professor , an expert in how drugs affect the brain , says it should soon be possible to get drunk safely — by consuming ‘ healthy alcohol ’			1
he has been experimenting with laboratory - created substances that will supposedly allow people essentially to switch intoxication on and then off again			0
first , you drink a glass of his synthetic creation , designed to produce the same happy , fuzzy feeling engendered by a moderate amount of alcohol			2
then , once you tire of being drunk , you simply swallow an antidote pill to sober you up instantly			2
professor @entity11 , who works at @entity32 , and has spent most of his working life treating alcoholics , says harm - free booze would ‘ revolutionise ’ healthcare			1
‘ these ambitions are well within the grasp of modern neuroscience , ’ he says			1
the professor , it must be said , has a notorious record as a self - publicist and has previous form in championing ‘ healthy ’ inebriation			1
he was sacked from his post as the government ’s chief drugs adviser in 2009 for declaring that cannabis , @entity50 and lsd are less harmful than alcohol and cigarettes			1
indeed , he claimed taking @entity50 is no more dangerous than riding a horse			1
despite widespread criticism that downgrading @entity50 would send out the wrong message and could convince youngsters it was all right to take the drug , he put his thesis to the test in a stunt on @entity63 with an ‘ experiment ’ on several participants			1
true to form , @entity11 recently posted a blog celebrating his self - administered experiments with alcohol			1
‘ after exploring one possible compound , i was quite relaxed and sleepily inebriated for an hour or so , then within minutes of taking the antidote i was up giving a lecture with no impairment whatsoever , ’ he said			1
he claims to be experimenting with substances that copy the way in which alcohol affects one of the brain ’s chemical transmitter systems			1
this system is called gamma aminobutyric acid ( @entity81 )			0
its job is to ‘ keep the brain calm ’ , says @entity11			1
‘ alcohol relaxes users through mimicking and increasing the @entity81 function			1
’ the problem is that alcohol also potentially causes aggression and addiction , not least because of the way it releases people from their inhibitions			1
@entity11 says that ‘ in theory ’ he can create a substance that ‘ makes people feel relaxed and sociable , and remove the unwanted effects ’			1
that sounds hugely ambitious , if not deluded			0
professor @entity11 says he may have invented alcohol that gets you drunk without the hangover for one thing , he seems to ignore the fact that for many , if not most , of us who like a drink , any enjoyment of the intoxication is secondary to the appreciation of the peaty tang of a 12 - year - old @entity115 whisky , for example , the intense fruitiness of a fine @entity117 or the complex bitterness of a @entity120 beer brewed by monks			1
all of these drinks have a unique taste and are steeped in culture and heritage to which the good professor seems oblivious			2
presumably , in @entity11 ’s brave new world , we will all simply ingest some colourless , odourless , flavourless chemical produced in sterile laboratories			1
and though we might be open to the idea of a problem - free alcohol drug , the fact is that in nature there is no such thing as a free lunch — or a consequence - free drinking session			1
science shows you ca n’t separate the pleasure of being drunk from the long - term damage that being inebriated can cause to your brain			2
if @entity11 ’s ‘ healthy alcohol ’ really works in a similar manner to conventional alcohol , ultimately it will affect the brain in the same ways — thus causing many of the same kinds of social and physical harm			1
perhaps most alarmingly , without a hangover , people wo n’t even realise what sort of damage they ’re doing			0
without the threat of a hangover , the temptation will be to keep going @entity164 around with our mental chemistry is a notoriously inexact science			0
the human brain is , after all , the most complex biological entity in the known universe			0
sousing it with chemicals opens myriad pathways to dangerous unintended consequences , in the short and long term			0
only recently have scientists fully unravelled the way in which alcohol affects us			2
studies by the @entity179 show how the drug hits the brain like a sophisticated military task force , knocking out its defences , as well as causing civil disorder and chaos			0
alcohol affects brain chemistry by altering levels of neuro - transmitters			2
these are the chemical messengers that transmit the signals that control thought processes , behaviour and emotion			0
alcohol either increases their activity or dampens it , depending on which areas are affected			2
the @entity81 calming system , for example , is affected in numerous ways			0
as well as making us feel more relaxed under the influence of booze , it also makes us sluggish and slurred			0
our inhibitions also get turned down			0
we become more talkative , more self - confident			0
this disinhibition , plus the pleasure effects , means that the brain encourages us to have another glass — and then another , and another			2
experienced drinkers know this is the point to stop — having suffered the horrors of previous hangovers			2
professor @entity11 was sacked from his post as the @entity221 s chief drugs adviser in 2009 for declaring that cannabis , @entity50 and lsd are less harmful than alcohol and cigarettes as @entity230 , the famously bibulous novelist , wrote in his book on drink : ‘ guilt and shame are prominent constituents of the hangover			1
’ but without the threat of a hangover , the temptation will be to keep going			2
there is another important factor to consider			0
the drunken brain also shuts down its limbic system , which controls our emotions and memory			0
emotions — as we all know — become exaggerated , often with disastrous consequences			2
this is one of the primary reasons why alcohol - related problems cost the @entity249 £ 3.5 billion a year			2
most of this money is used to treat the indirect harm caused by alcohol - induced recklessness			0
a study for @entity258 has shown that half of all violent assaults are related to alcohol , more than half of rapists drink alcohol prior to committing their attacks , and more than a fifth of accidental deaths are alcohol - related			0
we also know that the brain compensates for the regular presence of alcohol by altering its production of neuro - transmitters			0
if the drinking stops , physical and mental withdrawal symptoms — even the notorious @entity274 ( delirium tremens — @entity276 for ‘ shaking frenzy ’ ) — can ensue			1
and the brain tends to develop a tolerance to pleasure - inducing drugs			0
people need to take ever more of them to achieve the same effect			0
with professor @entity11 ’s ‘ healthy alcohol ’ , there is a possibility that people may simply never take the antidote , but keep taking further doses instead			1
the fact is that any substance or activity that fires up the brain ’s pleasure centres can become addictive			0
there are other psychological dangers , too			0
constant use of pleasure - inducing drugs is also associated with the development of mental illness			0
as we have seen with the rise in use of super-strength cannabis , being habitually heavily intoxicated can seriously alter the way in which young people behave			0
however , professor @entity11 is determined to press ahead with his experiments			1
as he writes in his blog : ‘ i have identified five such compounds and need to test them to see if people find the effects as pleasurable as alcohol			2
all that is needed now is funding to test and put them on the market			0
’ it seems doubtful that his ‘ healthy alcohol ’ will contain any compounds that induce a sense of personal or social responsibility			1
nor can his lab experiments properly investigate his invention ’s potential for long - term and widespread damage			0
budgetary constraints on his work mean the tests will almost inevitably be too small - scale and short - term to explore the possible dangers fully			0
moreover , this laboratory - made alcohol might work perfectly well on someone as drug - literate as professor @entity11 , but he is surely not representative of the most vulnerable people in our society			1
we need to consider carefully whether we really want ‘ healthy alcohol ’ to be made widely available , or whether it would create a hangover that might last for generations .			1
