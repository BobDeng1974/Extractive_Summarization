rating : there is a knock on the door at 7.15am			1
what could the matter be ? i abandon my ablutions and open the door			1
a man is standing with two newspapers i had ordered			1
presumably , the knock at weekends is even earlier			1
it is not a great start to the day			1
but then , just about everything about the newly opened @entity14 has jarred from the moment we set foot inside the huge , soulless lobby that has all the charm of an airport hotel in @entity21			1
impressive on the outside : the @entity24 's @entity23 has been slotted into the former @entity25 this is doubly disappointing because it is terrific from the outside			2
the listed building started out as the @entity25 in 1923 and looks across @entity31 ’s @entity30 in @entity32			1
it is @entity34 - owned - which might explain the clashing , shiny interiors			1
signs are written in @entity39 and @entity40			2
apparently , lots of @entity34 stay here to be near the @entity43			2
check - in takes an age			1
the printer is not working and the receptionist keeps going behind the scenes to sort it out			2
i ’m paying £ 150 , room only			2
she tells me that if i want a bath i can upgrade to an ‘ executive room ’ for an extra £ 20			2
i ask if she can upgrade me for nothing given that there are 317 rooms and dozens of those are empty			1
i push it some more and she relents			2
the corridors have empty cheap picture frames on the walls			1
it ’s a relief to get to the room , which is fine in a gauche sort of way			0
we like the bed , with its white leather headboard and the @entity34 wallpaper behind it			0
the rest of it is tinny			0
we pop our noses into the restaurant off the lobby , but the smell of stale food and the bright lights repel us			0
the receptionist had said the hotel has ‘ an arrangement ’ with the @entity34 restaurant next door , so we go there instead			1
turns out there is no arrangement at all , save for their being an entrance to it from the lobby			0
a spacious sort of welcome : the lobby is certainly large , but our inspector considered it ' soulless ' the heating is n’t working properly in our room , you ca n’t open the windows and the bathroom is cramped			1
for £ 12 you get tea or coffee and access to the continental buffet			0
i ask for a double espresso but am told it will cost extra			0
‘ i only intend to have two scoops of yogurt , ’ i tell the restaurant manager			0
‘ are you really going to charge me £ 12 and then insist that i pay extra for the coffee			0
’ ‘ i ’m sorry , but that is what it costs , ’ he says , politely			0
but when he asks me to sign the chit , he ca n’t bring himself to charge for the coffee			0
@entity118 and behold , the printer is still not working when i check out , and the whole process takes ten minutes			0
they email my receipt later			0
best that can be said is that @entity14 is a work in progress			0
@entity24 ’s @entity23 @entity31 ’s @entity125 @entity32 @entity126 020 3262 1026 @entity127 doubles from £ 120 ( room only ) rating :			1

*sizeable* new @entity32 hotel looks hugely *stylish* from the exterior
its *location* makes it a good *choice* for a shopping weekend in west @entity32
however , our inspector found the hotel soulless - and largely empty
