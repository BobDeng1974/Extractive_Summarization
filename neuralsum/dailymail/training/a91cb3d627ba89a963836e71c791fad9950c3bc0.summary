the conservatives will need to slash £ 21 billion from the welfare budget after the election because the pensions bill keeps rising , experts warned last night			1
the @entity5 ( @entity5 ) said @entity1 spending plans suggest post-election cuts to @entity9 ’s bloated benefits bill will have to be far deeper than those imposed since 2010			1
in a major new study , the respected think - tank said a £ 7 billion reduction in working age benefits since 2010 had been cancelled out by a £ 7 billion rise in the pensions bill			1
@entity17 will have to cut £ 21billion off the benefits bill after the next election in order to stick to his spending plans as a result , the £ 220 billion welfare bill is ‘ virtually unchanged ’ , it says			1
but the @entity5 said the bill would have been £ 16.7 billion higher without changes introduced by the @entity27			2
@entity28 has said the @entity1 will impose £ 12 billion of welfare cuts after the election , including cutting the benefits cap from £ 26,000 to £ 23,000			1
but the @entity5 said reductions of £ 21 billion – almost double the amount announced so far – will be needed by 2020 if the @entity34 are to stick to their plan of cutting other government spending at the same rate as that seen since 2010			2
it said the biggest cuts to the benefits system were ‘ yet to come ’			0
the report said that cutting another £ 21 billion from welfare would require a 23 per cent reduction in working - age benefits if the @entity34 continue to protect pensioners from the austerity drive			1
the @entity5 director @entity47 has exposed the scale of @entity50 cuts required to balance the books after the next election and the think - tank warned that if future governments keep mr @entity28 ’s ‘ triple lock ’ , under which the basic state pension rises in line with whichever is highest – inflation , earnings or 2.5 per cent – it will result in support for the elderly growing faster than earnings and prices in the long term , at a cost of many billions of pounds a year			1
the basic state pension will already be costing £ 1.1 billion more by 2015/16 than if it was linked to inflation and £ 4.6 billion more than if it was linked to earnings , it found			0
‘ growing pensioner numbers and higher entitlements among new pensioners have pushed up real - terms spending on the state pension by £ 12 billion between 2010/11 and 2015/16 , ’ the report said			0
shadow work and pensions secretary @entity75 criticised the government 's failure to reduce welfare spending ‘ this has been partially offset by falls in spending on other benefits for pensioners , leaving overall spending on benefits for pensioners £ 7 billion higher			2
in contrast , spending on benefits for working - age adults and for children has fallen by around £ 7 billion			1
’ work and pensions secretary @entity89 last night highlighted figures in the report showing a sharp fall in out - of - work benefits			0
spending on @entity95 ’ @entity94 is due to fall from £ 8.5 billion in 2010 to £ 5.2 billion this year			0
the £ 3.3 billion reduction is enough to fund the employment of more than 120,000 nurses			0
mr @entity89 said : ‘ our welfare reforms – as part of our long - term economic plan – are getting more people off benefits and into work			2
that means more people waking up every morning with the security of a regular wage and a chance of a better future for themselves and their family			0
‘ not only that , it ’s cutting the benefits bill too , meaning we can get the deficit down so our economy is stronger and more secure			0
’ the new report also found there was evidence that tougher sanctions have had ‘ some success ’ in encouraging claimants to return to work , particularly single parents			0
but @entity126 work and pensions spokesman @entity75 said the government had failed to reduce the welfare bill despite imposing ‘ cruel and unfair ’ cuts .			2

the *chancellor* will have to cut working - age benefits by 23 *%* after election
overall cuts of £ 21billion needed to balance the books by 2020 , the @entity5 said
@entity17 has *previously* claimed £ *12billion* in welfare cuts needed
