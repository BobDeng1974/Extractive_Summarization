by @entity0 faced with two young children desperate for the lavatory during a visit to the opticians , @entity1 discreetly asked if they could nip to the loo			1
but staff at @entity8 recommended she leave the premises or risk the children wetting themselves – because using the staff toilet was impossible for ‘ health and safety reasons ’			1
mrs @entity1 , 43 , took her three children – @entity14 , eight , @entity15 , seven , and @entity16 , four – to her local @entity8 in @entity17 last monday			1
@entity1 , with her children @entity14 , left , @entity15 , right and @entity16 , centre			1
both @entity14 and @entity16 wanted to use the toilet in @entity8 but were told they were n't allowed having come straight from school , @entity14 and @entity16 complained they needed the toilet			1
but the staff suggested mrs @entity1 take the youngsters down the road to @entity27 to relieve themselves instead			2
mrs @entity1 , a writer , said : ‘ it sounded so incredible			2
i said to them , “ surely you can bend the rules for a child ? ” it was bonkers			0
’ as the branch was running late for @entity14 ’s eye appointment , mrs @entity1 thought there would be no problem in letting the pair use the toilet			1
she said : ‘ i asked the girl on the desk , but she said they only had the staff toilet and customers could n’t use them			2
‘ she then asked an older woman , who was very matter of fact and said no. she was quite curt			0
‘ i sat down again for another five minutes , and by this time @entity14 was feeling quite uncomfortable and embarrassed			2
the family were in the @entity17 branch of @entity8 so @entity14 , pictured , could attend an appointment , when the incident occurred ‘ i knew that if little @entity16 wet himself there would be tears			1
we did n’t have any spare clothes for him , so i was wondering what i was going to do			0
‘ it ’s a very uncomfortable situation to put a mum with three children in to			0
’ as @entity14 went in for her eye test , mrs @entity1 became desperate and called the @entity8 press department in head office on her mobile phone			1
she told them she was sitting in one of their branches and that staff had banned her children from going to the toilet			2
she said : ‘ i asked them whether it really was their corporate policy to force me to leave my child behind and run the other two down the road			0
‘ he stuttered a bit and then said there may be boxes in the corridor which posed a @entity84 risk and that was why			0
‘ i told him they were putting health and safety above children ’s needs , and then he said he would call the shop			2
’ five minutes later , the store manager emerged , having spoken to head office			0
‘ she confirmed that for health and safety reasons , she was unable to let customers use the staff toilets , ’ mrs @entity1 said			1
‘ she asked me whether i would take legal responsibility for the children if she made an exception , and i just burst out laughing at the absurdity of the situation			1
’ at this point , the two children were allowed to relieve themselves and head outside after their ordeal			0
mrs @entity1 said : ‘ at 8 years old , @entity14 would have been mortified to wet herself and @entity16 would be sobbing			1
‘ i honestly think the whole episode was crazy , given the store prides itself on being family friendly			0
the @entity8 store in @entity17 , where mrs @entity1 's children were only allowed to use the toilet if he took ' legal responsibility ' for her children ‘ this was a store full of female staff , all presumably mothers and yet they did n’t have the common sense to let young children go into the back and use the toilet			1
’ a @entity8 spokesman said : ‘ we are sorry for any inconvenience caused to @entity1 and her children			2
‘ the health and safety of our customers is always at the forefront of our minds			0
the store does not have a designated customer toilet			0
‘ the only staff toilet has access issues as it is located off the shop floor			0
under the circumstances a decision was made to let the customers use the toilet at their own risk			0
