shadow health secretary @entity8 warns an ageing population means hospitals will become ' warehouses of older people ' without major changes in the health service mr @entity8 said that as people get older their needs become a ‘ blur of the physical , mental and social ’ and health spending should be combined into a single £ 119 billion budget			1
ministers including health secretary @entity28 and pm @entity29 have blamed poor standards of nursing for problems on wards			2
but mr @entity8 says the @entity5 has failed to adapt to the increasingly old patients it treats			1
councils , qwhich are currently responsible for adult social care , are under pressure to keep council tax down so have ‘ whittled away ’ services			2
‘ it 's financial madness , as well as being bad for people , ’ mr @entity8 said in a speech to the @entity42 as he launched a @entity2 policy review of health and social care			1
mr @entity8 used a speech to the @entity42 to call for @entity5 , social care and mental health budgets to be merged ‘ hospital chief executives tell me that , on any given day , around 30 per cent to 40 per cent of beds are occupied by older people who need n't have been there			1
if we leave things as they are , our district general hospitals will be like warehouses of older people - lined up on the wards because we failed to do something better for them			0
‘ but it gets worse			0
once they are there , they go downhill for lack of whole - person support and end up on a fast - track to care homes - costing them and us even more			0
‘ we could get much better results for people , and much more for the £ 104 billion we spend on the @entity5 and the £ 15 billion on social care , but only if we turn this system on its head			1
‘ we need incentives in the right place - keeping at home and out of hospitals			0
’ he claimed hospitals operate a ' a 20th century production - line model ' which treats immediate problems like broken bones or the impact of a stroke without considering the ' whole person '			0
staff in hospitals who used to rarely see a patient over the age of 80 have not changed to deal with ever greater numbers of very frail people in their 80s and 90s , with intensive physical , mental and social care needs			1
mr @entity8 spoke of his distress in 2007 at being unable to fulfil a promise to his sister - in - law , who had breast cancer , that she would be able to die at home			2
' i told her i thought i would be able to			0
but , after a day of phone calls , i will never forget having to going back to @entity105 and say it could n’t be done			0
' and i was a minister who knew how the system worked , so what chance have families who are at a low ebb and do n’t know where to start ?

' i welcome the fact that @entity2 have finally recognised the importance of integrated care , but they had 13 years to achieve this and failed to do so			2
in fact , the system they left was fragmented and focused on treating patients as a collection of conditions not as individuals			0
' in the last two years we have put patients at the heart of the @entity5 by allowing gps , who understand the sometimes complex conditions of their patients , to commission services to meet their personal needs			2
' @entity150 , chief executive of @entity42 think tank , said : ' the demands of an ageing population , changing burden of disease and rising patient expectations mean that fundamental change is needed			0
