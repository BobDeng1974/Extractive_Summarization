by @entity0 published : 10:43 est , 2 january 2013 updated : 13:38 est , 2 january 2013 just over a year ago , @entity1 was hooked up to an oxygen machine , so weak she was physically unable to hand her son and daughter their @entity6 presents			1
but thanks to an organ donor and a successful operation , @entity1 , 31 , was able to celebrate this year with 10 - year - old @entity11 and four - year - old @entity12			1
' if i had n't have had my new lungs then i would n't be here now , ' she said			1
' i was getting the presents wrapped early for last @entity6 in case i was going to die			1
' i was so poorly i knew i could n't go on			2
i was no use to anybody			0
' @entity1 with her children @entity12 , four , and @entity11 , ten , and new puppy @entity19			1
she feared she wo n't be alive this @entity6 after developing a fatal lung condition since her transplant , the former nurse , from @entity23 , has made the most of every moment			1
@entity1 , who was diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension four years ago , said : ' it was my first @entity6 being well with @entity12 and the first time i could properly enjoy it with her			1
' last year , i was sitting there with my oxygen mask on watching them open presents and i could n't even help them put things together			1
the kids did n't know any different , really			2
@entity1 in hospital last february after her double lung transplant ' i just smiled and carried on			1
what kept me going was hoping that i would get new lungs and all the time i was constantly thinking about getting better			0
' since having her operation , @entity1 , from @entity44 , near @entity23 , has amazed doctors with her progress and she now has check - ups every three months			1
she has been making the most of being well and has celebrated @entity49 and @entity50 with the children , and got a new puppy , a chocolate labrador			0
all clear : thanks a successful operation @entity1 was given a second chance the family also went on holiday to @entity58 , though @entity1 had to fly back home and go straight to intensive care at @entity61 after just one day abroad when she began to struggle to breathe			1
she said this @entity6 has been extra special and that she enjoyed shopping and taking the children to see @entity6 for the first time			2
she said : ' the kids were so excited and i could n't wait to decorate the house and get the @entity6 music on			1
' another highlight was the pantomime at @entity71			0
it is an annual tradition for the family but @entity1 says this time the children were excited because they could ' sit where they wanted '			2
last she was in a wheelchair			0
she hosted more than 10 members of her family on christmas day after making a deal the previous year that if she got new lungs she would cook			0
@entity1 said she thinks of her donor every day and wants to encourage others to sign the donor register to help others			2
she said : ' if the lady who gave me her lungs could see how much she has changed my life i think she would be very happy			2
' if only she could see the smiles on my kids ' faces			0
' @entity11 wrote me a letter today and it said " i love you mummy and i am so happy that you have got new lungs "			0
i think of her all the time			0
' pulmonary hypertension is a serious medical condition involving raised blood pressure within the pulmonary arteries - the blood vessels that supply the lungs			1
it has a variety of causes : it can be inherited , related to other health conditions such as a hole in the heart , or the cause may be unknown			0
it can damage the right side of the heart , making it less efficient at pumping blood around the body and getting oxygen to the muscles			2
in people with pulmonary hypertension , the walls of the pulmonary arteries are thick and stiff , making it difficult for them to expand to allow more blood through			1
alternatively , the arteries may be blocked by blood clots which can also hinder blood flow			0
this makes it difficult for the right - hand side of the heart to pump blood through the arteries , so this part of the heart has to work harder , and will become gradually weaker , potentially leading to heart failure			2
symptoms include : shortness of breath , fatigue , feeling faint or dizzy , chest pain , a racing heartbeat and leg swelling			0
it can be difficult to diagnose because its symptoms are similar to many other heart and lung conditions , but it can be very serious so it is important you visit your gp if you experience symptoms			0
left untreated , it may cause heart failure			0
