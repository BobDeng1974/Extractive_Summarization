waiting for my shipmates to arrive , i sprawl on the deck of @entity3 , a 37ft yacht , and look across the water from @entity6 to @entity7			1
with a backing track of halyards clinking against masts in the marina , and the sea reflecting the sun ’s evening rays , it is hard to believe this is @entity17			0
exhilarating : sailing boats navigating the @entity19 in blustery but sunny weather during @entity21 week i ’m here for a five - day yachting course with @entity23 , a training centre run by @entity26 - certified instructor @entity25 and his sister , @entity28			1
the pair abandoned their day jobs in 2008 to teach full - time , and lead shore - based theory classes in @entity34 and the @entity35 , as well as practical courses on the @entity37			1
families can learn with @entity39 ahead of a @entity41 flotilla holiday			1
ahoy ! instructor @entity42 offers a student the benefit of her experience on one of @entity3 's courses my fellow mariners include a sailing novice from @entity50 , a boat - owning barrister from @entity53 and a human resources manager from @entity55			1
what do we have in common ? @entity58 , besides our love of the sea			0
but we do n’t waste time on small talk : before long we ’re rubbing sun cream into one another ’s backs and sharing grisly details of our love lives			0
@entity68 is equipped not just with limitless knowledge , but a buoyant personality			0
it ’s high fives all round when we get something right			0
leaving @entity6 bright and early on the first day , we practise our manoeuvres and then sail across to the @entity19			1
there ’s great satisfaction in navigating your way using a chart , pencil , plotter and compass			1
the boat is rigged with a state - of - the - art gps system , but the @entity26 insists we learn the manual methods			1
it ’s a challenge - one false tidal calculation can leave you washed up for hours			2
sundowner : the sunset at @entity92 , where the @entity93 moors up for the night we sleep on @entity3 each night , and take turns cooking			2
in @entity96 , i conjure up a spag bol			0
the barrister delivers his verdict - the carrots should have been chopped smaller - before @entity68 takes us ashore to @entity101 ’s , a packed sailors ’ bar where dancing on the tables is compulsory			2
we journey on to @entity106 , where we moor up against the sea wall and sleep to the smell of fish and chips , then the pretty market town of @entity113 , and over to @entity21 , where preparations for the regatta are in full swing			1
sail away : sailing boats compete in @entity118 ( left ) ; boats moored up in @entity113 's pretty harbour ( right ) we even sail breathtakingly close to the toothy @entity121			2
the trip proves a great opportunity for a whistle - stop tour of @entity17 seaside towns , and the hard work of our daytime sails is balanced with chilly swims , ice cream and boozy evenings			1
the highlight is our night sail , using nothing but lights to guide the way			2
my heart thumps as we slip the lines at dusk and chug from @entity113 into an empty sea			0
‘ in one minute you should see a green buoy to starboard , flashing every four seconds , ’ the skipper calls from the chart table , as the crew peer through binoculars			0
the line on the horizon where the sea meets the sky is indistinguishable in the dark , and it feels as though we ’re floating on air			0
practical courses with @entity23 ( 01424 461185 , www.nomadsailing.co.uk ) run between march and november , from £ 245 per person			0
@entity154 includes food and accommodation .			0

the @entity37 is a great place to learn to sail - but warm weather always helps
courses cover a full range of skills , including how to navigate in darkness
students - who can be from all walks of life - live and sleep on their yacht
