a @entity1 nuclear plant is on alert as flood waters from @entity4 threatens the cooling of its spent uranium fuel rods			1
@entity8 said that a further rise in water levels could force operators at its @entity1 @entity13 nuclear power plant to use emergency water supplies from a fire hose to cool the spent rods			1
the alert - the second lowest of four @entity19 action levels - came after water levels at the plant rose by more than 6.5 feet , potentially affecting the pumps that circulate water through the plant from @entity25 , an @entity19 spokesman said			2
concern : floodwaters could submerge the pump that is used to cool the water in the spent uranium pool at @entity13 ( pictured ) those pumps are not essential since the plant is shut for planned refueling at the moment			2
however a further rise to 7 feet could submerge the service water pump motor that is used to cool the water in the spent fuel pool			1
if cooling ceased , the pool would take 25 hours to reach boiling point			0
the spokesman said the company could use water from a fire hose to cool the pool if necessary			2
the used uranium rods in the pool could cause the water to boil without additional coolant : in an extreme scenario the rods could overheat , risking the eventual release of radiation			0
the @entity19 said in a statement that it expected water levels would begin to abate within the next several hours			0
@entity4 made landfall last night as the most powerful @entity57 storm to hit the @entity58 , bringing a storm surge of more than 13 feet			0
there have been about a dozen instances of alert - level nuclear incidents in the past four years , according to @entity19 press releases			0
an alert - level incident means there is a ' potential substantial degradation in the level of safety ' at a reactor			0
nuclear fears : the @entity72 nuclear power plant in northeastern @entity73 last year			1
helicopters and hoses were used to keep the uranium fuel rods cool the concerns over the status of the spent fuel pool at @entity13 were reminiscent of the fears that followed the @entity72 disaster in @entity73 last year , when helicopters and fire hoses were enlisted to ensure the pools remained filled with fresh , cool water			1
the nuclear industry has said that the spent fuel rods at @entity72 were never exposed to the air			2
@entity13 is a single unit boiling water reactor that began operation in 1969			0
it was the first large scale commercial nuclear power plant in the @entity58 and is scheduled to be retired at the end of 2019 .			1
