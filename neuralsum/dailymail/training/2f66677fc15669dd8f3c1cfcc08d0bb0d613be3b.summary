as hitch - hiking goes , it ’s not normally a helicopter that stops to provide the transport			0
but then it ’s not every day that the passengers getting a lift are the @entity7 and @entity8			1
@entity10 , @entity8 and pet dog @entity9 were the recipients of a free ride from a friend flying past their home in @entity17			1
he picked them up then , after a 200 mile flight , dropped them off at an aerodrome on the outskirts of @entity22			1
homeward bound : the @entity7 and @entity8 and dog @entity9 with @entity25 after landing at @entity26 , south @entity27 coming in to land : @entity29 of @entity30 can be seen through the helicopter window ( right ) as it touches down in @entity27 their arrival was photographed by a surprised - and delighted - couple watching light aircraft taking off and landing at @entity26 in south @entity27			1
when the brightly coloured helicopter arrived at the small grass airfield they had no clue to the identities of the vips aboard and did n’t initially recognise them			0
they said : ‘ we had no idea it was the royal couple at the time			0
‘ we had a look at the photos on our laptop a few days later and realised that it was in fact @entity10			0
‘ it ’s amazing to think that we saw the royal couple without any crowds around them			0
‘ they were like any other couple out with their dog - albeit having just been flown in by helicopter			0
‘ @entity9 was very well behaved			0
@entity8 let him down on to the grass and he stayed close , although you could see he was excited			1
’ taking charge : prince @entity10 is seen talking to the helicopter pilot while @entity8 ( partially obscured left ) is seen holding on to @entity9 @entity26 must be getting used to @entity66 visitors dropping in			1
a week earlier the @entity10 and the @entity67 had to make an emergency landing in their helicopter at the airfield			0
@entity72 and @entity73 were 15 minutes into their journey to the @entity76 in @entity77 from central @entity22 when a ‘ technical problem ’ with the rear rotor blade forced their pilot to divert to the nearest airfield			1
dressed down : prince @entity10 was dressed slightly more casually than when he was pictured at the wedding of @entity84 , 30 , and @entity85 , 26 , at @entity86 on saturday the aircraft , understood to be carrying seven people , made an urgent controlled landing - later described as ‘ hairy ’ - at @entity26 and the royal couple continued their journey by road			1
the orange @entity93 helicopter carrying @entity10 and @entity8 belongs to @entity95 - based @entity94 , whose managing director @entity25 is a friend of the couple			1
the four - seater is no ordinary aircraft			2
in 2004 mr @entity100 used it to circumnavigate the globe in a record time , flying solo around the world in just over 17 days			0
the ‘ royal ’ flight last month was not on the same scale , the trip taking around 90 minutes - a distinct improvement on a car journey that would take nearer five hours			2
both @entity10 and @entity8 were casually dressed in jeans with her baby bump clear to see as they walked away from the aircraft , which bears an uncanny resemblance to @entity116 , the little helicopter in @entity120 ’s children ’s book			1
@entity8 carried cocker spaniel @entity9 from the helicopter but let him loose to run obediently alongside the couple as they walked across the grass airfield			2
the @entity7 drove off in a @entity126 while @entity8 , who is due to give birth to their first child next month , left in a separate vehicle			1
mr @entity100 , 49 , said : ' i know the couple and occasionally , when i am routing past @entity17 , i give them a lift if it is convenient to all parties			2
’ who was behind the controls of the @entity138 - registered helicopter is unclear			0
mr @entity100 , who in 2009 provided a helicopter for @entity141 to travel to a conference in @entity143 , was n’t saying			0
while he and @entity148 - based @entity147 pilot @entity10 sat in the front with @entity8 , @entity9 and a @entity66 detective in the rear , that model of helicopter can apparently be piloted from both right and left seat			2
a @entity66 source said : ‘ the flight was n’t paid for and the helicopter was n’t chartered			0
it was a gift , a lift from a friend			2
’ @entity159 landing zone : @entity26 is no stranger to royalty landing at its airfield - a helicopter carrying prince @entity72 and @entity73 had to make an emergency landing there a week earlier			1

the @entity7 and @entity8 landed at @entity165 , @entity27
a friend picked them up from @entity17 and dropped them off there
an aircraft carrying prince @entity72 and @entity73 was forced to land there last month
