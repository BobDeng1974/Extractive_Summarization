' i do n't want to hear how she screamed and cried			1
but i do want these girls to get what they deserve			1
' proceedings will be held in open court going forward , prosecutors announced this week			1
she even helped in the search : ms @entity5 acted like she was sad the girl she allegedly killed was missing , even helping to look for her prosecutors have said they will recommend ms @entity15 receive a 20 - year sentence , but the confessed killer faces as much as 40 years behind bars			1
court documents offer no insight into the motive for the crime			1
on may 1 , @entity40 's father said the only reason he could think of was that they ' did n't like her any more			2
' @entity61 reported that @entity30 stated : ' they did n't like her anymore			2
that 's the only response i got			2
' i want a reason , i want some kind of reason ( for this to ) happen			2
there is no reason i do n't care if you have the best reason in the world , but there 's no reason ( for this to happen )			2

charged : @entity9 , of @entity126 , pleaded guilty to the second - degree murder of @entity9 and she awaits sentencing in a juvenile detention center investigators have said little since announcing the charges three weeks ago			1
people sit in the chairs at @entity136 's @entity135 , gaze at @entity30 's photo on a bulletin board and wonder : how could anyone so young plot to kill a classmate and friend ? ' they look as normal as any other kid that you could ever see , ' said barber @entity147			1
' not kids you would think would have anything to do with anything like this			2
' the other girl 's identity is , for now , shrouded by the confidentiality of juvenile court			2
though @entity147 says most people in town have figured out who it is , it 's unclear how long the three girls had been friends or just how close they were			2
it 's also unclear whether prosecutors will try to have the second suspect charged as an adult , as @entity15 was			1
they 're like , " what is taking so long ? " ' said @entity147 , whose daughter @entity169 had been friends with @entity30 since junior high			2

' everybody really , really wanted her to come home			0
' for months , police chased down tips to no avail			0
the transcript from @entity15 's hearing shows the break came january 3 , when she finally told investigators the truth - and where to find the body			1
but it was n't until march that authorities confirmed it was @entity30 , and silence followed until the day of the plea hearing			0
accused killers : @entity236 ( right ) makes faces with confessed killer @entity9 ( left ) while tweeting a picture that describes their friendship ' i think police who were involved in the front lines of that interview and that part of the investigation were stunned at @entity9 's confession , ' @entity183 told judge @entity250 that day			1

she vanished after slipping out the bedroom of her @entity202 home in july 2012 @entity15 's family issued a public apology through a lawyer but has made no further statements			1
' there is no way to describe the pain that we , too , are feeling , ' they said			0
' we are truly sorry for the pain that she has caused the @entity30 family , and we know her actions are unforgivable and inexcusable			0
' our daughter has admitted her involvement and she has accepted responsibility for her actions			0
' our hearts are broken for your loss , ' they told the @entity30 family , ' and we are still trying to come to terms with this event			0
' @entity208 has declined interview requests			0

tribute : a @entity309 image created by @entity9 's friends as they all prayed she would show up under the law , @entity311 are no longer limited to kidnappings in @entity2			1
