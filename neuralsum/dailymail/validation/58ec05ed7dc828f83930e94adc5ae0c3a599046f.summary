we 've divided the @entity1 into teams from the north and south of @entity5 - with @entity7 side @entity6 included in the south			2
@entity9 had the choice to pick any players from the north , in any formation , with no limit on how many from each club			2
@entity16 picked his @entity17 on monday , and you can read that here			1
here 's how we split the clubs : @entity21 @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity6 , @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 @entity32 @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 @entity32			1
it is perhaps the fiercest argument between the people of @entity5			0
but without dipping into the political allegiances , property prices and weather , we 're sticking to the ultimate debating point â€“ football			0
this week we are starting a new @entity21 debate - who would you pick and who would win ? in the @entity57 , each season they stage an all - star match that pits the best from the @entity60 against the cream of the @entity62			0
and would n't it be fascinating if the @entity1 adopted a similar event ? yesterday , @entity16 selected his @entity65 here , @entity9 reveals his @entity67 - plus seven subs			1
then on wednesday , we 'll reveal who would win the match thanks to our friends at @entity72			1
and , as always , we want you to tell us who you would have picked in your team ... goalkeeper : @entity77 ( @entity37 ) tough call between @entity79 and @entity77 , but the @entity6 stopper is better at organising his defenders and more commanding in the air			1
and , as he showed against @entity83 , he can stop a penalty too			0
right back : @entity85 ( @entity39 ) been outstanding this season and @entity88 fans will have an anxious wait this summer to see if a bigger club snaps him up			0
@entity85 can also play in the centre of the defence but he 's most threatening down the right where his crosses would cause havoc to any rearguard			1
centre half : @entity98 ( @entity40 ) would surely have been an @entity5 regular if he played for a more glamorous club than @entity40			0
better than @entity100 or @entity101 , less injury - prone than @entity102			0
this team is so crammed with attacking talent , the two centre - halves are in purely to defend			2
and they 're good at that			0
@entity77 has been superb in the league and showed against @entity109 he can do it in @entity111 too @entity85 has been outstanding this season and @entity39 fans will have an anxious wait this summer @entity98 pictured scoring for @entity40 against @entity38 at the @entity116 centre half : @entity118 ( @entity36 ) totally fearless , he keeps putting his head and body in the way of danger - just what you want from a centre - half			1
useful in both penalty areas at set - pieces too , he gets his fair share of goals for a defender			0
@entity132 and @entity98 would n't let anything pass , allowing the two full backs to push up			0
left back : @entity135 ( @entity34 ) just gets better and better with age			0
fantastic at set - pieces , both delivery and shooting , and so calm on the ball			0
has got over the disappointment of not joining @entity38 and it 's no coincidence @entity34 hit their dodgy patch when he was out of the team injured			1
right wing : @entity147 ( @entity36 ) showed at the last @entity148 he has now taken over @entity150 's mantle as the best player in the @entity5 team and it 's hard to believe he is still only 20			1
the one player in @entity156 's squad that you think could actually make it with @entity160 or @entity109 , he is quick , skilful , has natural balance and courage on and off the ball @entity36 's totally fearless defender @entity118 ( right ) squares up to @entity79 at @entity165 recently @entity34 's @entity135 just seems to get better and better with age in the demanding @entity1 @entity147 has become an brilliant performer for @entity36 this season as they look to tie him down @entity170 midfield : @entity172 ( @entity38 ) people ask why @entity38 's form has improved in the last couple of matches			1
simple , @entity172 is back from injury and making the team tick			1
always seems to know when to play the right pass , and makes average players around him look good and the good players look great @entity170 midfield : @entity182 ( @entity34 ) if this team has steel down the middle in @entity118 and @entity98 , and stealth in @entity172 , @entity182 adds speed			1
he can cover ground to make tackles and when he needs to use the ball , the @entity190 is neat and tidy			0
one of @entity193 's best signings and no wonder bigger clubs want him			2
left midfield : @entity197 ( @entity37 ) with @entity135 behind him , @entity197 would n't have to hug the left - hand touchline like a traditional winger , he would start from there , link up with @entity135 at times but also drift inside and drop grenades infield			2
on his day , a hugely talented and influential player			0
@entity204 is rightly getting plaudits at the moment , in @entity207 they say @entity197 is better			0
@entity172 has returned from injury and is making @entity38 tick for manager @entity210 @entity182 , pictured scoring for @entity34 against @entity39 at @entity211 , makes the xi @entity197 ( above ) and @entity37 team - mate @entity213 make it into our @entity67 striker : @entity213 ( @entity37 ) has taken over @entity218 's mantle as the best player in the league			1
absolutely lethal against any type of opposition as his hat - trick against @entity224 showed in the @entity225			0
may be asked to leave the penalties to @entity135 though after his fluffed effort in the @entity228			0
striker : @entity150 ( captain ) ( @entity38 ) @entity150 has often formed good strike partnerships with players who are of similar build and technique , @entity230 springs to mind in his brief spell at @entity38 , so i have no doubts he would be prolific with @entity213			1
i can see them being on the same wavelength and @entity150 would spot the @entity242 's runs early			1
@entity150 captains our @entity67 for his outstanding form for @entity210 's @entity38 subs @entity246 ( @entity40 ) : another in the @entity77 mould ; big , commanding , wo n't leave his defenders alone			1
@entity249 ( @entity37 ) : if you need someone to see out the final 20 minutes , he 's perfect			2
@entity102 ( @entity38 ) : another who can put his body in the way if you 're defending for your life			0
@entity256 ( @entity37 ) : totally unpredictable , if you do n't know how he 's going to play , how can the opposition ? @entity259 ( @entity38 ) : coming into some great form , can play right or left , and will track back when needed			2
@entity261 ( @entity36 ) : a great impact sub , can score in instant with his quick feet @entity265 ( @entity38 ) : been written off this season , but it 's less than a year ago he scored that header in @entity148			2
@entity256 just misses out on the starting xi but the @entity37 star makes our subs bench there is no room for @entity277 ( left ) but @entity261 ( right ) can act as a great impact sub @entity38 's @entity265 ( left ) and @entity259 ( right ) just miss out on the starting xi ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity279 , @entity280 , @entity281 , @entity282 , @entity283 ; @entity284 , @entity285 ; @entity286 , @entity287 , @entity288 ; @entity289			2
subs : @entity291 , @entity292 , @entity293 , @entity294 , @entity295 , @entity296 , @entity297 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity77 ; @entity85 , @entity98 , @entity118 , @entity135 ; @entity147 , @entity172 , @entity182 , @entity197 ; @entity213 , @entity150 subs : @entity246 , @entity299 , @entity102 , @entity256 , @entity259 , @entity300 , @entity301			1

@entity77 gets the *nod* *ahead* of @entity79 as @entity67 's goalkeeper
@entity213 and captain @entity150 lead the team up front
@entity172 and @entity182 dominate in central midfield
@entity311 will test who is better with help from @entity72
