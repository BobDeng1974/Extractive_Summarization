by @entity0 and @entity1 ' torture ' : @entity3 , 26 , was tasered five times by police and has won a five - figure compensation award two police officers have been sacked after an innocent man was tasered five times in their van , it was revealed last night			1
@entity3 , 26 , said he passed out from the excruciating pain inflicted by the 50,000 - volt weapons after he was dragged from the street			1
he was shot in the chest , stomach and leg at point - blank range as up to three officers assaulted him			1
after four years of wrangling , in which @entity20 insisted they did nothing wrong , pc @entity22 and pc @entity24 were fired for gross misconduct			1
a third officer involved in the incident , sgt @entity26 , had already been sacked in 2011 for gross misconduct over a separate matter			1
the case , believed to be the first in which officers have been fired for misusing a @entity33 , raises questions about the trend to arm police with the potentially deadly weapon			1
last night , mr @entity3 said : ‘ i have never come across such brutality , and for that to be at the hands of the police – people i would have expected to trust – has been really disturbing			1
‘ i was n’t offering any resistance when they launched an unprovoked attack , hitting me on the head and choking me			0
' when i raised my hands in self - defence i was tasered five times and dragged to a police station like a criminal			1
’ the @entity53 ( @entity53 ) said the officers used unnecessary force and ignored national guidelines			1
mr @entity3 was arrested during a night out for his brother - in - law ’s birthday in @entity59 on december 19 , 2009			1
he was grabbed by the three officers after relieving himself in an alley			1
the car engineer , who works at the @entity64 plant , was dragged into a police van			0
he was tasered twice – with barbs attached to charged wires being fired into his body – and had the pistol - like @entity33 themselves pushed directly into his body three times and discharged , an agonising technique known as a ‘ drive stun ’			1
one officer ripped the metal barbs from his body , despite rules that this must be done by a doctor			0
mr @entity3 said : ‘ i just sat on the seat and then i felt a blow to the side of my head from one of the officers , then another blow and i was repeatedly insulted			1
‘ at no stage was i resisting or even trying to defend myself			0
‘ then i was hit again on the temple and choked by one officer using his forearm			0
i could n’t breathe and thought i was going to pass out			0
in self - defence i pushed the officer and that ’s when all hell broke loose			0
‘ one got her @entity33 out and drive - stunned me to the shoulder and then another aimed his taser at me			1
i put my hands out and said , “ i ’m not doing anything ” , and then he shot me			0
all my muscles tensed like i was in cramp – it was excruciating			0
questions remain over the proliferation of @entity33 among the @entity110 's police forces			0
use of the weapon has proved fatal in the past ‘ then the driver turned round and tasered me on the shin			2
‘ i could n’t believe it - it felt like i had been kidnapped for having a wee in an alley and now i was being tortured in the back of the van			0
i was in agony and in shock			0
‘ i tried to grab the @entity33 to stop it happening again and he tasered me in the hand and then i was tasered yet again			2
i must have passed out because when i came round i was in handcuffs			2
’ mr @entity3 was charged with assault but was acquitted in september 2010 by a magistrate who questioned the officers ’ account			1
but his ordeal was not over as he fought the force for justice			0
the @entity53 upheld two appeals as the force first recommended ‘ management advice ’ over the arrest and then said the taser use was ‘ necessary and proportionate ’			0
it criticised police for not giving enough weight to the victim ’s account or cctv footage contradicting what the officers said			2
finally , a misconduct hearing led to the sacking of the two officers			2
mr @entity3 , who had not been in trouble with police before , has won a five - figure compensation sum after suing the force			1
he said : ‘ none of those officers belonged on a police force			2
’ his mother , @entity157 , 56 , said : ‘ to be tasered while offering no resistance is torture			2
’ @entity160 , of the @entity53 , said : ‘ there is public concern over the increase in taser use			0
incidents such as this do nothing to alleviate that concern			0
’ @entity20 said : ‘ all officers issued with tasers are required to complete training and annual re-qualification			2
' since this incident , @entity20 has introduced a procedure which requires each use of @entity33 to be reviewed by a senior officer , prior to submitting details to the @entity178			0

@entity3 passed out from the pain after he was tasered in @entity59
he was tasered twice and ' drive stunned ' a further three times
two officers have now lost their jobs four years after the incident
