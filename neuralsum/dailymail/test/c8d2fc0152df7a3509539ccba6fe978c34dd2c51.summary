a 47 stone woman who was so immobile she needed her husband 's help to go to the toilet has revealed how he prevented her from losing weight			1
despite being morbidly obese , @entity6 , from @entity7 , @entity8 , lived off a diet of fried chicken and barbecue sauce , and was unable to care for herself , meaning @entity12 had to do everything for her			1
but @entity12 has admitted he did n't support the 24 - year - old with her bid to lose weight because he feared if she became slimmer , she would n't need him anymore , in my 600lb life , which airs tonight on @entity19			1
shedding 11st means she is now mobile and can stand up on her own @entity6 , who now weighs 35st 8lbs ( 500lbs ) thanks to surgery , reveals on the show that @entity12 had become her ' caretaker ' - helping her go to the toilet and into the shower , and putting powder between her rolls of flesh afterwards to stop her skin from chafing			1
she said that the pair 's relationship had become ' slim to none '			1
she added : ' being that size was miserable			2
i was always in pain			2
my weight was killing me			2
i could n't do anything on my own			2
' my husband @entity12 had to help me take a shower and wipe my butt			1
he had to be the caretaker			2
' my marriage with @entity12 was really difficult too because my weight prevented me having a real marriage			1
@entity12 had to be my caretaker			1
' ' our intimacy was slim to none			2
we ’d been together for so long sometimes i thought , " am i with you because i love you or because you 're the one person who looks after me			2
" ' ' i hated myself			2
i was so tired of being that way			2
' before her surgery @entity6 was reliant on husband @entity12 to tend her every need @entity12 was in charge of the shopping and meals and kept @entity6 fed with unhealthy foods but despite the deadly weight , @entity6 was living on a diet of fried chicken and barbecue sauce			1
' i knew my body was getting to its limits			2
when i was five i started to become a chunky kid but i just got on with it , ' she said			2
' but when i was 13 my life totally changed			0
' i 'd always been happy go lucky but after that i did n’t like myself			0
i was angry and depressed and started eating more			1
' i thought that if i was bigger i could protect myself			0
i met @entity12 right after i turned 17			1
i was 400lbs by then and could hardly walk			0
' i hated myself , i hated everything so i tried to kill myself and then i got put into hospital			0
' although @entity6 lived through her suicide attempt , seven years later at the age of 24 , she felt life was slipping through her fingers			1
' i was hardly existing			0
going out is not so easy when you 're over 600lbs			0
@entity6 and @entity12 shopping after her weight loss : she now buys lots of protein and checks labels for calories ' i wanted to have some freedom again and i knew my weight was keeping me from that			1
' i hated going out in public all the time because i could n't stand peoples reactions			0
i felt judged , that people were saying : “ look at that fat girl ”			0
' ' but i knew it was something i 'd done to myself through what i ate			0
i was raised with country home cooking and i loved fried , mash potatoes , crisps i just love food			0
' but husband @entity12 now admits he did not help @entity6 's weight loss			1
' i thought if she lost weight she would n't need me @entity104 did n't want her dropping weight and leaving me			0
' but @entity6 was determined to make a change			1
' i did n’t want to waste my life just sitting in a chair			0
i wanted to have a career , have a baby			1
i wanted to grow old			2
' i knew if i did n’t change i was going to die			0
when pain has destroyed your life it can take something just as painful to restore it			0
' desperate for a solution , @entity6 and @entity12 went to a @entity7 bariatric surgeon			1
‘ every other surgeon had turned me away so i did n't want to get my hopes up			0
' at 5ft 2in @entity6 's ideal weight is 8st 8lbs ( 120lbs ) but her doctor predicted that at almost 47 stone ( 660lb ) she was unlikely to get to 30			1
he set @entity6 the task of losing two stone ( 28lbs ) to demonstrate she was capable of losing weight before he could agree to surgery			1
he also raised concerns about @entity12 's role as the feeder in their relationship , which he said would have to change			1
@entity6 used to love pizza and anything containing potato - chips , crisps and mashed potato ' i needed @entity12 to help me , says @entity6			1
' i knew if we did n’t do it as a team i ’m would n't make it			0
i did n’t want to die young			0
' @entity6 and @entity12 moved to @entity7 to be closer to the doctor and set about a weight - loss mission			1
' i had to break a lot of old habits , ' she said			0
' i ate smaller potions – a lot smaller than before			0
they did n't fill me up but i hoped once i had surgery i would n't have the hunger pains			2
' @entity12 was a big help – he was careful about the food he bought			1
' i also tried to exercise			0
the first time i managed to ab crunches i was pretty excited , ' she says , even though she still had to them from a sitting position on the couch			0
but as @entity6 gained independence , @entity12 grappled with the change and worried he was becoming dispensable			1
' he wanted to be needed - that was his primary concern , ' she said			1
it took several months for @entity6 to drop the weight and be scheduled for surgery			1
‘ i could n't believe someone was finally helping me and that i was going to get the surgery			2
i ca n’t wait to get my life back , ' she said			2
' the operation went well but my first night after surgery but @entity12 was n’t there when i woke up			1
it made me a little scared because i needed him more than ever			2
i knew if i did n’t have his support			0
i would n't be able to do this			0
' the first month went but it was n't as easy as i 'd hoped			0
@entity12 was preparing my meals and did n't necessarily want to follow the doctor 's instructions			1
five month after the surgery @entity6 had trouble breathing and was rushed to hospital			1
' i felt like i was having a heartache			0
i 'd never felt like that before , ’ she said			0
the doctor found she had not lost any weight since the surgery and warned her over-eating was affecting her lung function to the point that she was not too far from dying			2
but it was the wake up call @entity6 and @entity12 needed			1
the doctor insisted they see a therapist to get the diet on track			1
@entity12 admits : ‘ i used to take care of her but when she started being able to move around herself after the surgery that really scared me because			1
i do n’t want her to leave me			0
she ’s the only woman i 've ever loved			0
in the supermarket with having shed teh wight , @entity6 looks for the ' light ' options it forced @entity6 to confront relationship issue too : ‘ i had n’t been touched			1
we did n’t have intimate time			0
it was partly @entity12 's fault and partly because i did n't want it			1
' but therapy helped us discover that we still care so much about each other			1
this whole process has told us that			0
' now ten months after the surgery @entity6 weighs 35st 8lbs ( 500lbs ) , and is proud of the progress she 's made			1
‘ one thing i wanted to do is help other people but when you ’re 47 stone ( 660lb ) you need everyone to help you			2
so now i 'm volunteering to put food bag together for needy children			0
' to be able to help others make me feel more of a person			2
i ’m also working on my relationship with @entity12 ' @entity12 and i had never been on a date			1
i 've always been so big i could never really go out			0
' and so thankfully this process has show me just how much i love him - and how mush he loves me			0
‘ our grocer shopping changed lots too			0
we look at labels and look at what i can and ca n't eat			0
i 'm getting things with a lot more protein			0
‘ i feel like a different person			2
‘ i have a long way to go but i now know i can do it because i have @entity12			1
