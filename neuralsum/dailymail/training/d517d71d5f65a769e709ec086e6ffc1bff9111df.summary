' i accuse the @entity5 government of kidnapping , mistreating , and killing an innocent man			2

@entity34 , which means ' of @entity1 ' in @entity109 , was his nom de guerre			2
also known as @entity0 , @entity5 prosecutors in 2000 described @entity0 as sitting on a council that approved terrorist operations for @entity3 , which would become infamous worldwide a year later after the september 11 terror attacks			1
before that , @entity3 's august 7 , 1998 , truck bombings at the @entity5 embassies in @entity62 , @entity22 , and @entity116 , @entity23 , were its deadliest assault			1

@entity123 ( left ) , and @entity124 , the son and brother respectively , of @entity3 suspect @entity0 speak to the press in @entity127 , near the @entity1 capital @entity17 ( file ) the @entity23 attack , conducted minutes later , killed 11 people and wounded 85			1
@entity34 , believed to be a computer specialist for @entity3 , conducted visual and photographic surveillance of the @entity61 in @entity62 in late 1993 , the federal court indictment against him and others alleges			0
in 1994 , he and other @entity3 members researched alternate potential sites in @entity62 including the local office of the @entity140 , as well as ' @entity142 , @entity143 and @entity144 targets , ' according to the indictment			0
his path to @entity22 and @entity3 remains unclear			2
@entity34 is believed to have spent time in @entity148 , where @entity149 was based in the early 1990s			0
after @entity149 was forced to leave @entity148 , @entity0 turned up in @entity142 in 1995 where he was granted political asylum under unclear circumstances and lived in @entity152			0
he was arrested by @entity153 in 1999 , but released because of lack of evidence and later fled @entity142			0
after his indictment in december 2000 over the embassy bombings , @entity5 officials said they believed he was hiding in @entity159			0
@entity34 later said in court filings that he returned to @entity1 as dissent against dictator @entity162 grew into an open revolt that led to the leader 's downfall and killing in 2011			2
he said he ' joined with forces of @entity167 and the @entity5 ' to replace @entity162 , hoping to establish a ' stable @entity169 secular state			0
' in october 2013 , the @entity172 's @entity171 swooped into @entity17 and seized @entity0 after dawn prayers , his brother @entity170 said			1
@entity34 said the soldiers took him to the @entity175 , where @entity177 agents interrogating him warned the questioning would be the ' easiest step ' of three			0
' i took this to mean that the physical and psychological torture would only increase if i failed to cooperate with my questioners , ' he said in a court affidavit			0
' these threats continued the entire time i was on board the ship			0
' @entity34 's lawyer , @entity25 , argued his client did n't plan the bombing			0
' this case involves issues much more tinged with emotion and trauma than other cases , ' @entity25 said in 2013			0
' the fact that mr. @entity0 will be tried in @entity8 , barely a half mile from the @entity200 , and that @entity149 and @entity3 will be referenced numerous times in connection with his co-defendants can not be ignored			0
' @entity34 is n't the only terror suspect to be snatched by @entity5 special forces in @entity1			2
@entity5 troops last year grabbed @entity207 , a suspect in the 2012 attack on the @entity5 @entity209 in @entity210 that killed four @entity5 , including @entity5 ambassador @entity211			1
the ability for @entity5 troops to move freely in @entity1 reflects the chaos gripping the country beset by rival militias and political factions in the years since @entity162 's downfall			1
battles openly rage in its east and west as @entity169 militant groups have turned coastline cities and border areas into safe havens			0
@entity1 's rival governments had no immediate reaction to @entity0 's death .			1
