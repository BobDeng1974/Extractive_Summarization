if he wondered who would provide @entity3 ’s magic after the sale of @entity5 , at least he still has ‘ @entity6 ’			1
that , thanks to @entity8 , is the moniker of @entity10			1
according to the @entity12 striker , @entity10 is a magician with a ball at his feet and after watching the @entity16 tear @entity17 to shreds , @entity0 was only too happy to embrace that theme			1
replacing @entity5 like - for - like is something @entity0 admits is impossible but he has an idea of how to keep @entity3 a creative , vibrant , attacking force and — judging by this swaggering display — @entity10 is crucial to that master plan			1
subs ( not used ) : @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 goals : @entity54 ' @entity42 ' @entity17 : @entity55 ; @entity56 ( @entity57 58 ' ) , @entity58 ( @entity59 81 ' ) , @entity60 , @entity61 ( @entity62 81 ' ) ; @entity63 ( @entity64 46 ' ) , @entity65 ( @entity66 46 ' ) , @entity67 ( @entity68 ' ) , @entity69 ( @entity70 76 ' ) , @entity71 ( @entity72 77 ' ) ; @entity73 ( @entity74 46 ' ) subs ( not used ) : @entity76 , @entity77 deployed in a central role just behind @entity8 and flanked by @entity79 and @entity44 , @entity10 was the architect of a friendly victory that sent @entity3 bounding into the new campaign , as he provided the assist for @entity8 ’s 10th - minute opener and scored one of his own			1
@entity39 — who excelled on his debut following his £ 20million move from @entity88 — and @entity42 also found the target but afterwards @entity0 reflected on ‘ a successful pre-season ’ while reserving a eulogy for @entity10			1
‘ he is so gifted and the fans appreciated it because of the level of the opponent , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ his ability is just magical			2
his ability to get out of tight situations , his view of the game			2
that ’s his best position too — playing between the lines , he tempts defenders out			2
‘ you saw that with the ball he played around the corner for the first goal			1
it ’s about sustainability with him now			2
he ’s lit up this country with his quality			2
we are now going on to a big stage in @entity115 and he will have chance to show that there , too			0
’ @entity17 looked short of condition and presented far less of a challenge without star names @entity121 , @entity122 and @entity123 , but that could not detract from @entity10 ’s quality			1
the weight of his passing , speed of thought and ability to deliver the perfect ball really impressed			0
it was no wonder that when he was replaced in the 71st minute the @entity133 gave him a standing ovation			0
@entity3 will look to renew his terms during the coming campaign — no problems are envisaged and he still has four years on the deal he signed when arriving from @entity139 in january 2013 — and @entity0 believes @entity10 is now about to really make his mark			1
‘ he will show at that ( @entity115 ) level that he is a top player , ’ said @entity0			0
‘ i see him over the next four or five years becoming a real talent in world football			0
@entity3 desperate to challenge - @entity37 everybody dance now : @entity8 shows off his customary celebration after scoring neat finish : @entity8 puts the @entity149 1 - 0 up after just 10 minutes @entity150 : and @entity39 makes it two just a few minutes later face grab : @entity67 challenges @entity79 in the air high riser : @entity56 vies for the ball in the air with @entity44 @entity157 to think , then , that @entity16 overlooked him for the @entity158			1
where his guile and invention could have made a difference			0
instead , he was forced to spend his summer watching helplessly from afar			0
‘ i felt anger ( at not being selected ) , ’ @entity10 said			0
‘ not because i ’m selfish , but i could have offered something			0
i will use this anger and push myself to my limits			0
i saw how @entity5 ( @entity5 ) was a maniac in training			0
at this point , my body and mind feel like clay			0
i will mould it the way i envision			0
’ the other high point for @entity0 , who revealed that @entity174 has a tendon problem that threatens to keep him out of next sunday ’s @entity177 opener against @entity88 , was the way @entity39 eased into the centre of @entity3 ’s defence			1
@entity3 shipped 50 league goals last season but @entity39 showed enough to suggest that , of all the signings @entity0 has made , he could be the most crucial			1
‘ @entity39 was just what i ’ve been looking for since @entity185 left , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ he is a dominant no 1 centre half , who reads it well , with good guidance of the back four			0
his qualities of range of passing too			0
‘ i ’m delighted with the result as they have been one of @entity194 ’s top teams			0
we got four really good goals and could have had a few more			0
we ’ll be ready ( for @entity88 )			0
we will have a behind - closed - doors game this week and i ’m looking forward to next weekend			1
’ as well he might if @entity10 is in a similar , spell - binding mood			2
@entity199 : @entity44 takes the ball away from @entity17 's @entity72 unmarked : @entity42 finds some space in the box to slot home jubilation : and the @entity12 midfielder was delighted to make it four good job : @entity0 congratulates @entity8 on a quality performance after his substitution 1			1
@entity211 @entity210 found a rock at the back : @entity0 tried numerous combinations and signed three players to fill the gap left by @entity185 ’s retirement but @entity39 looks like providing the answer he has been looking for in the middle of his defence			1
the @entity221 was impressive on his debut			0
@entity223 must be the way forward it was only a friendly but @entity3 were lightning - quick out of the blocks against @entity17 and that tactic , which was so effective last season , will again be employed at @entity27			1
@entity8 and @entity39 took the game away from @entity17 scarcely before it had begun			1
@entity230 gives sterling service on the wings @entity0 said after the game that @entity44 could be ‘ anything he wants ’ and there is no doubt the young winger is maturing into a fine talent			2
if he produces his form of last season , he will be a fine bet to win @entity243 .			2

the young @entity16 was a *constant* threat to the @entity247 side throughout
@entity8 opened the scoring as @entity3 dominated @entity17 in 4 - 0 win
@entity39 scored soon after from a corner on his first @entity27 appearance
@entity255 and @entity79 completed the rout after the break
