by @entity0 for five years , @entity2 's @entity1 has circled the moon , sending back thousands of images of the lunar surface			1
@entity2 has now revealed the most stunning five images of the lunar surface - and has asked the public to pick their favourite			1
the space agency is planning to create a special site called ' @entity11 ' - with the winning image as the cover photo			1
. @entity1 stereo images provide scientists with the third dimension - information critical for unraveling the physics involved in impact events			1
@entity1 entered lunar orbit in june 2009 equipped with seven instrument suites to map the surface , probe the radiation environment , investigate water and key mineral resources , and gather geological clues about the moon 's evolution			1
the robotic mission set out to map the moon 's surface and , after a year of exploration , was extended with a unique set of science objectives			0
@entity1 observations have enabled numerous groundbreaking discoveries , creating a new picture of the moon as a dynamic and complex body			1
these developments have set up a scientific framework through which to challenge and improve our understanding of processes throughout the solar system			0
'' @entity11 as @entity52 ' collection gives the public the opportunity to see the moon as others have seen it for centuries – as an inspirational muse – but this time from the perspective of being in orbit with a series of ' eyes ' that see in different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum , ' said @entity65 , science education specialist at the @entity67 in @entity68 , @entity69			0
@entity1 launched from @entity70 on june 18 , 2009			1
after a four - day journey , the orbiter successfully entered lunar orbit june 23			0
the winning cover image will be announced june 18 with the release of the @entity76 as @entity52 collection of 24 images			1
voting is already underway here and will close june 6			0
in the five years since , @entity1 has brought the world astounding views of the lunar surface and a plethora of exciting science data			2
' @entity1 has been a remarkable mission with discoveries that have given us insight into solar system history and the inner workings of the moon , ' said @entity93 , @entity1 project scientist at @entity2 ’s @entity94 in @entity68 , @entity69			1
' after five years , @entity1 continues to make ground breaking discoveries			2
' the craft will celebrate five years in orbit june 18			0
@entity1 entered lunar orbit in june 2009 equipped with seven instrument suites to map the surface , probe the radiation environment , investigate water and key mineral resources , and gather geological clues about the moon 's evolution			1
on 10 june 2011 the @entity1 spacecraft slewed 65 ° to the west , allowing the @entity109 to capture this dramatic sunrise view of @entity111			2
@entity111 's features are so steep and sharp because the crater is young by lunar standards , only about 110 million years old			0
the interior wall of the @entity117 crater has many distinct flows of granular material which narrow as they reach towards the floor of the crater			0
the crater is 7 km in diameter located at 21.7 ° n , 29.8 ° e near the @entity124 where @entity125 17 landed on 11 december 1972 and is named after @entity117			0
this image features night time temperatures at the @entity129 's north pole as measured by the @entity131 instrument			2
areas in blue and purple represent colder temperatures , while areas in orange and red represent warmer temperatures			0
at any given point in the @entity129 's orbit , half of the @entity129 is in daylight , while half of the @entity129 is in darkness			0
the @entity144 ( @entity145 ) aboard the @entity1 ( @entity1 ) sends laser pulses down to the surface of the @entity129 from the orbiting spacecraft			2
these pulses bounce off of the @entity129 and return to @entity1 , providing scientists with measurements of the distance from the spacecraft to the lunar surface			0
as @entity1 orbits the @entity129 , @entity145 measures the shape of the lunar surface , which includes information about the @entity129 's surface elevations and slopes .			1

images released to celebrate fifth *anniversary* of @entity2 's @entity1 ( @entity1 )
