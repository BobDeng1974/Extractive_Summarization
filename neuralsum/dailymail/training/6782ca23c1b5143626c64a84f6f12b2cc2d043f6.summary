with players banned from wearing anything but white and visitors exhorted to dress smartly , @entity1 's dress codes are almost as famous as its tennis			1
but two fans decided to put neat dresses and tidy chinos to one side , and turned up wearing unusual bikini tops made from tennis balls instead			1
completing their unusual ensembles were novelty sunglasses , one pair topped with a model @entity16 and the other with a tropical palm tree			2
are you sure that 's allowed ? a pair of tennis fans brave the weather at @entity1 in tennis ball bikini tops despite the chilly weather - and the occasional shower that left other @entity1 fans running for cover - the patriotic pair looked cheerful , perhaps helped along by their glasses of @entity32			1
although @entity1 has no formal dress code , the official guide to the tennis tournament warns that ' the removal of shirts or [ wearing ] any clothing likely to cause offence ' could result in ejection from the south @entity42 venue			1
members of the @entity44 do , however , have to adhere to a strict set of rules about what they can wear , with distressed denim , midriff baring tops and leggings all outlawed			0
instead , the club asks guests to wear a ' lounge suit or tailored jacket , shirt , tie , trousers and dress shoes			0
ladies are expected to dress to a similar standard			0
' brrr ! fans arriving at @entity1 were forced to unfurl umbrellas and don their rain macs this morning chilly : a patriotic fan sits down to watch the tennis on @entity67 safely beneath a huge umbrella although anything goes on @entity67 , those watching from the @entity71 's @entity70 are warned that rigid standards of dress will be ' strictly enforced '			1
players too have strict rules to follow , with many introduced following years of colourful , bottom - scraping tennis dresses and equally wacky men 's shorts			2
according to the latest set of rules , players must wear outfits that are ' almost entirely white ' , with large manufacturers â€™ logos ' not encouraged '			2
underwear must also be white , while caps , headbands , wristbands and socks must also be white , although coloured trims no wider than a centimetre are allowed			0
strict : the rules for players such as @entity94 specify ' almost entirely white ' garments @entity96 to meet you : @entity98 beams at @entity99 as she takes her seat in the @entity101 on court : crown prince @entity103 was part of the crowd watching @entity107 beat @entity108 today sees @entity109 back on court for the third time , with @entity113 's @entity112 providing the opposition			1
also on court today are @entity116 and @entity117 , while @entity118 star @entity94 has already beaten @entity120 challenger @entity119 in straight sets			0
despite the big - hitters on the court , the crowds of tennis fans have garnered almost as much attention this time around - thanks in no small part to the celebrity quotient			0
today saw @entity98 and @entity129 join @entity99 in the @entity101 , as did @entity118 's @entity130 and speaker of parliament @entity131 .			0

the fans were on court *ahead* of @entity109 's third round match this *afternoon*
wore tennis ball inspired bikini tops and cheerful novelty sunglasses
@entity1 has a dress code but only for those in the @entity70
players must wear ' almost entirely white ' clothes and *undergarments*
