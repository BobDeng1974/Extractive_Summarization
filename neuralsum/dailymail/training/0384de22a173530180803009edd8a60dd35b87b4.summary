by @entity0 @entity2 's prince @entity1 attends a mission briefing in the @entity2 controlled flight - line in @entity5 blunders by @entity2 commanders were ‘ devastatingly exploited ’ by the @entity9 to carry out an attack on @entity5 while prince @entity1 was deployed in @entity11 , a damning report says today			1
complacency by senior officers meant security was inadequate , allowing heavily - armed insurgents to storm the supposedly impregnable @entity2 base in 2012			1
the defence select committee was also scathing about the @entity18 , accusing officials of being ‘ obstructive and unhelpful ’ in the face of the committee ’s inquiries to establish what had happened			0
two @entity24 were killed and 16 troops – eight @entity26 and eight @entity2 – injured when gunmen swarmed through the perimeter fence to assault the airfield , setting off explosions which destroyed six harrier jump jets and three vehicles			1
prince @entity1 was stationed at @entity5 to fly @entity35 attack helicopters			0
the committee found more than half of the guard towers were regularly unmanned despite at least 20 breaches of the perimeter fence in two years			0
troops were exposed to ‘ unnecessary risk ’ because @entity2 commanders , who were responsible for security , had not put in place sufficient safeguards to ensure a @entity9 attack was foiled			1
following a @entity26 investigation into the incident , two generals were ordered to quit			2
incredibly , no - one from @entity2 has paid the price for the fiasco			1
the @entity53 understands at least four officers involved have been promoted			2
in a highly critical conclusion , the cross-party committee said : ‘ we are concerned that the perimeter security and force protection measures in place at the time of the attack were inadequate			2
‘ insufficient attention was given to the fundamental requirement of defending @entity5 from external assault			0
two @entity24 were killed and 16 troops injured when gunmen swarmed through the perimeter fence to assault the airfield ' we believe this was complacent			1
given that the attack took place in the @entity2 sector of the camp , @entity2 commanders must bear a degree of responsibility for these systemic failures			2
’ the attack on @entity5 , which sprawls over 20 sq miles of @entity81 , southern @entity11 , took place on september 14 , 2012			0
at 10pm , 15 @entity9 fighters wearing stolen @entity26 military uniforms crept towards the base which was ringed by a 30ft wire fence			1

as well as the coalition casualties , 14 @entity9 were killed			0
the surviving gunman was captured			0
defence secretary @entity104 said : ‘ the @entity18 is not complacent and always seeks to capture and learn lessons from current operations			0
@entity2 commanders have identified and acted upon all lessons following the attack on @entity5 in 2012			2
