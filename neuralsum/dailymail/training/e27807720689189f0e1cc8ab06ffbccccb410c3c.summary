the handset will be launched during 2015 , according to @entity36 rumour site @entity37			0
it follows a move towards larger screen sizes , with the most recent models boasting 4.7 and 5.5inch screens			0
production was said to have begun on thursday at @entity5 's foundry in @entity6 , @entity45 , as part of an effort by @entity13 to move chip production back to the @entity49 it had been reported back in july that @entity5 had received some orders for the chips , which the company effectively confirmed in october when the president of the company ’s chip - making division said that profits would improve once it began supplying its latest - generation chips to @entity13			1
the @entity60 company has built custom mobile chips for @entity13 since the launch of the first @entity14 in 2007 , but recently has seen its position reduced			1
reports say @entity13 may hold two @entity14 launch events next year , to release its @entity21 in spring , and its @entity14 7 in september			1

until 2013 , @entity13 released one handset each year around september time			1
this included a new model one year , followed by a slightly modified 's - version ' the year after			1

this was followed by the launch of its @entity14 6 and larger @entity14 6 plus this year amidst the furore of the @entity14 launch in september , @entity13 silently killed off its @entity95			1
but it was n't a drop in sales that brought about its demise , according to boss @entity100 , instead it was blamed on a lack of mechanical parts			0
speaking at the @entity104 conference , mr @entity100 said the tech giant no longer had access to the components needs to make the once iconic music player			0
and although sales for the product had fallen significantly in recent years , sourcing parts was the final nail in the coffin			0
mr @entity100 added the firm could have redesigned the gadget with different parts , but it would n't have been cost - effective and would have involved a ' massive ' task			0
the @entity118 may also be packaged together with the @entity119			0
‘ our source says that @entity13 is hesitant about launching the @entity122 in the spring of 2015 without a new @entity14 to go along with it , ’ explained mr @entity72			2
‘ [ @entity123 ] could give hesitant consumers an excuse to wait on buying both until the fall			0
’ the news comes as manufacturers revealed @entity13 has plans to kill off its @entity31 as early as next summer			2
launching a phone in spring would mean there was still the same number of handsets in the range once the @entity31 was discontinued			0
the report , by @entity138 's @entity137 , did not reveal the reasons behind the plans , but @entity13 has previously been known to discontinue models as they are replaced by newer versions			1
sales of the @entity31 were also poor , compared to the company 's expectations , and in january , research firm @entity146 reports the model accounted for just 27 per cent of @entity14 sales at the end of 2013			0
manufacturers will begin winding down production of the handset from january , and are expected to pull the plug completely by the ' middle of 2015			2
' @entity13 launched its @entity31 alongside the high - end @entity79 in september 2013			1

it has a plastic case , is available in five different colours , and at launch , prices started at $ 99 in the @entity49 , on a two - year contract , or $ 549 and £ 469 when bought outright			1

the news comes as manufacturers revealed @entity13 has plans to kill off its @entity31 next summer			0
sales of the @entity31 ( pictured at launch with @entity13 executive @entity178 ) were lower than expected			1

@entity13 did not make any formal announcement about ceasing the line at the time			0
@entity13 boss @entity100 later said the firm could have redesigned the gadget with different parts , but it would n't have been cost - effective and would have involved a ' massive ' task			1

' it was n't a matter of me swinging the axe , saying " what can i kill today ? " the @entity203 was the @entity13 ’s first digital music player , and although the original debuted in 2001 , there were six generations released up until 2007			0
