travellers could soon fly non-stop from @entity1 to @entity2 - or even further - under plans to change how planes use fuel			1
a collaborative team of scientists from nine institutions across @entity1 has designed a so - called @entity9 concept that would allow planes to refuel in mid-air			1
the system would involve a refuelling plane , carrying enough kerosene to top up to five passenger planes , located at various points along flight routes			2
the system would involve a refuelling plane carrying enough kerosene to top up to five passenger planes located at various points along flight routes as the passenger plane approaches , the refuelling jet would take off , fly beneath the plane before connecting specially - designed and made fuel tanks and pumps			1
it would then offload the required amount of kerosene before disconnecting and returning to the ground			0
an alternative scenario would see the jet circling in the air until it is needed			0
air - to - air refuelling would only be carried out near main airways and away from inhabited areas			0
it is a technique already used by the military , for example , to refuel state aircraft			0
the civil concept was developed as part of a wider project called @entity50 ( @entity51 )			1

the civil concept was developed as part of a wider project called @entity50 ( @entity51 )			1
the researchers , led by the @entity79 ( @entity79 ) in @entity80 and the @entity81 ( @entity82 ) , said kerosene reserves make up about a third of the weight on long - distance passenger flights at take - off			0
reducing them and refuelling mid-air could mean ' huge savings ' and figures suggest fuel burn , and therefore the amount needed at take - off , could be reduced by up to 23 per cent for every 6,000 nautical miles flown by a plane carrying 250 passengers			1
however , it is not known how much extra energy , fuel and carbon emissions will be released as a result of having more planes in the sky			2
nor is it clear how much the reduction in fuel burn and costs created by causing passenger planes to make fewer stops would offset those used by the individual , heavy refuelling jets			1
@entity112 has contacted the researchers to learn more			0
the scientists have spent the last three years studying the feasibility of civil air - to - air refuelling operations similar to those used for military aircraft			2
as the passenger plane approaches , the refuelling jet could take off , fly beneath the plane before connecting specially - designed and made fuel tanks and pumps at targeted locations on the plane ( illustrated )			2
it would then offload the required amount of kerosene before disconnecting and returning to the ground the civil concept was developed as part of a wider project called @entity50 ( @entity51 )			1
air - to - air refuelling ( illustrated ) would only be carried out near main airways and away from inhabited areas			0
it is a technique already used by the military they propose that passenger flights could take off with less fuel and retank once they reach an altitude of 33,000ft ( 10,000 metres )			2
this would also reduce noise pollution near airports since planes make more noise the heavier they are at take - off , said @entity148 from @entity82			0
the system would also allow for non-stop flights between destinations as far apart as @entity152 and @entity153			1
the researchers have already tested the concept using simulators to determine that the project is technically possible			1

reducing them and refuelling mid-air could mean ' huge savings ' and figures suggest fuel burn could be reduced by up to 23 % for every 6,000 nautical miles flight with a payload of 250 passengers the system would also allow for non-stop flights between @entity1 and @entity153 , for example , and the researchers have tested the concept using simulators ( pictured )			1
however , it is not known how much extra energy , fuel and carbon emissions will be released as a result of having more planes in the sky the @entity51 project also includes a second , more radical proposal which involves building an air - metro system , with giant aircraft circling the globe , and smaller ' feeder aircraft ' unloading passengers , luggage and waste midair , transporting them to destinations along the way			1
the researchers acknowledge though that for the second part of the project ' neither airworthiness nor acceptance of the idea by the general public is within sight			0
' the concept has been developed by experts from @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity204 in @entity205 , @entity206 in @entity207 , @entity208 , @entity209 , @entity210 , @entity82 in @entity152 , @entity211 and @entity212 in @entity213 .			1

project is called @entity50
refuelling planes would carry enough fuel for up to five aircraft
simulations have proved that the concept is technically possible and could allow for non-stop flights between @entity152 and @entity153 , for example
figures suggest it could cut the amount of fuel needed by a *quarter*
