by @entity1 reporter published : 14:01 est , 30 may 2012 updated : 06:50 est , 31 may 2012 police have been accused of wasting £ 5million prosecuting senior firemen over the deaths of four colleagues in a warehouse blaze – while failing to catch the arsonists who set the building alight			1
a jury yesterday threw out the case against @entity11 and @entity12 , who were accused of manslaughter through gross negligence in their handling of the fire in 2007			1
in the worst loss of life for the fire service in 35 years , part - time firemen @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 died trying to put out the fire			1
but while police never found the criminals who started the fire in @entity30 , @entity31 , £ 4.7million has been spent over five years trying to pin blame for the losses on the managers who let the firemen enter the building even though all employees had already been accounted for			1
cleared : watch manager @entity12 and station manager @entity11 were found not guilty of manslaughter following the deaths of four firefighters killed when a roof collapsed during warehouse blaze a third defendant , @entity42 , was acquitted on the direction of the judge earlier in the trial at @entity46			1
after the verdicts , critics said firemen may now hesitate before trying to save lives for fear they could be arrested			0
@entity53 , of the @entity54 , said : ‘ firefighters are furious at the police and prosecutors			1
we believe that the @entity60 ’s case , which was essentially that firefighters should stand aside and watch buildings burn , must be challenged by the @entity63 , if not the prime minister himself			2
’ the police officer in charge of the inquiry , detective superintendent @entity66 , insisted the investigation was justified and said he hoped the fire service had learned lessons from the tragedy			1
station manager @entity11 , 51 , and watch manager @entity12 , 45 , who acted as incident commanders , were charged with gross negligence manslaughter in february last year following a criminal inquiry which cost taxpayers £ 4.6 million			1
but after hearing six weeks of evidence jurors decided mr @entity11 and mr @entity12 had not acted illegally during their command of the incident on the evening of november 2 2007			2
speaking outside the court , @entity31 ’s chief fire officer condemned the decision to press criminal charges against three members of his brigade in the first place			1
anger : @entity31 chief fire officer @entity90 said the charges should never have been brought @entity90 claimed the defendants had been treated like ' common criminals ' and is now calling for the @entity94 and @entity95 to investigate how and why the prosecution was allowed to proceed			1
mr @entity90 , who was present in court during much of the six - week trial , said : ' it is crystal clear that these cases should never have been brought to court in the first place			0
' but today neither i nor any of my colleagues in the @entity105 feel any sense of relief			2
' rather we feel a sense of sorrow and remembrance for the four brave firefighters who died at @entity30 in 2007			1
' both @entity105 and the @entity113 have serious concerns about the case			0
mr @entity90 and both bodies will be writing to the home secretary and to the justice secretary to seek a formal investigation into the prosecution			0
mr @entity90 was also critical of ' undue aggression ' shown towards the firefighters charged with manslaughter during their time in police custody			1
during two days in the custody of @entity129 , mr @entity42 , mr @entity12 , and mr @entity11 had their belts and shoelaces taken away and were also held at a police station overnight between interviews			1
mr @entity90 said : ' i am seriously concerned - and the public should be seriously concerned - that today , up and down the country , fire officers will be asking themselves ... why on earth would i ever want to be an incident commander and face an unjustified legal attack in the way these three men have ? ' there were two independent reports into the blaze , one commissioned by the police and another commissioned by the @entity105 , which was seized by the police before @entity105 had a chance to consider it			1
station manager @entity11 speaks to the media flanked by @entity148 and @entity12 outside @entity46			0
the three men have been cleared of causing the deaths of four colleagues verdict : after hearing six weeks of evidence jurors decided mr @entity11 and mr @entity12 had not acted illegally during their command of the incident on the evening of november 2 2007 mr @entity90 said the investigation had been handled poorly and had put firefighters ’ safety behind the needs of the police			1
he said : ' the police investigation into this fire took a wrong turn very early on			2
' the police treated decent fire officers like common criminals			2
the court heard they were locked up in the cells overnight and even had their shoelaces taken away from them			0
' it has taken almost five years and five million pounds of public money to construct a flimsy case against these three men and when it was presented in court it simply fell apart			0
' tragedy : firefighters @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 were killed as they tackled the blaze in @entity30 , @entity31 , in 2007 collapse : an aerial view shows the roof of the warehouse after it collapsed killing the four firefighters the @entity183 said it was absurd that the arsonists who started the blaze had never faced trial , while those who struggled to put it out were ' relentlessly pursued ' by police and the @entity189 he added : ' both of these reports contained safety critical information of vital importance to the safety of firefighters up and down the country			1
' neither of them was released to the fire service until may 2011 - an incredible three - and - a - half years after the fire			0
' i am outraged that the secrecy surrounding these reports meant that firefighters remained at risk for so long			2
' the @entity54 ( @entity183 ) hit out at police and prosecutors after the two remaining firefighters were cleared			1
victims : ( clockwise from top left ) @entity20 , @entity19 , @entity22 and @entity21 were killed tackling the blaze in @entity30 , @entity31 , in 2007 the union said it was absurd that the arsonists who started the blaze had never faced trial , while those who struggled to put it out were ' relentlessly pursued ' by police and the @entity189			1
@entity54 assistant general secretary @entity53 said : ' this was the first time firefighters at an incident were accused of the manslaughter of their colleagues			1
' this prosecution cast a shadow across the whole fire service and caused anger and concern			0
' we are relieved at the not - guilty verdicts but firefighters are furious at the police and prosecutors			2
' the criminals who started the fire are still free , but those who tried to put the fire out were arrested , charged and brought to trial			2
' difficult decisions : detective superintendent @entity66 the officer in charge of the £ 4.6 million inquiry into the @entity30 - on - @entity241 tragedy conceded that ' difficult and unpopular ' decisions were taken during the investigation			2
but detective superintendent @entity66 believes the scale of the joint inquiry by @entity129 and the @entity247 was justified by the fact that three men were charged and brought to trial			2
describing the inquiry as one of the most complicated undertaken by @entity129 , mr @entity253 said : ' i think that the investigation has answered a number of important questions , in particular for the families that have lost loved ones			2
' i very much hope that the fire service generally will take on board some of the lessons learned from this tragedy and reflect upon them			0
' critics of the decision to charge @entity42 , @entity12 and @entity11 with gross negligence manslaughter claim too much weight was given to the evidence of one expert witness on firefighting techniques			0
but mr @entity253 said the inquiry had been proportionate , appropriate and had sought to establish the reasons for the ' unnecessary ' deaths			0
mr @entity253 said : ' there have been many challenges to overcome , difficult decisions to make and unpopular actions to take throughout the four and a half years			0
' whatever the result of the trial , the investigation has been successful and has had a number of positive outcome for the families of the four men who died and firefighters in @entity31 and across the country			1
' i promised that we would do everything that we could to determine how the four men - @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity22 and @entity21 - died and to find some answers for their families and loved ones			0
i believe we have done that			0
' during the inquiry , mr @entity253 added , some safety critical issues had been discovered which were of great importance for firefighters across @entity300			1
' as a result of those findings , i believe that there have been some changes to training for the use of breathing apparatus and fire behaviour			0
' investigating the deaths in the way , and to the extent , that we did was the right thing to do and has been justified by the fact that three men were charged and brought to trial			0
' the probable cause of the blaze was found to be a naked flame - after all other possibilities were excluded - and @entity129 arrested several people on suspicion of arson			0
but although migrants workers at the vegetable packing plant were interviewed through interpreters in around a dozen languages , there was insufficient evidence to charge anyone with arson			0
asked about criticisms of his force ’s treatment of the defendants who stood trial , mr @entity253 said he had led a highly professional inquiry in an independent manner			0
' where there is a loss of life , nobody is above investigation , ' he said			0
“ we must never ever lose sight of the fact that four people lost their lives			0
