a popular pie eating competition had to be declared void â€“ after the wrong - sized pies were delivered to the venue			1
a work experience chef was blamed for sending pies twice the official size to the @entity7 , held at @entity8 in the town			1
meanwhile , the competition pies were delivered to a nearby party being held by someone celebrating their divorce			1
but it was for only half a pie after umpires decided that consumption of a full pie could result in a dangerous ' swallow stall '			0
@entity27 , owner of @entity8 , said : ' the work experience lad was tasked with providing 24 competition pies , but mixed up the order and sent them to divorce party up the road			1
' by the time we realised , it was too late			2
' mr @entity27 added : ' we had to go ahead			0
it was a bit like @entity38 replacing @entity39 for a show game at the tennis finals in the @entity42 , but everyone took it in their stride and demonstrated the professionalism of pie - eating at this level			0
' it was a shame , because these lads practise long and often : you can see how seriously they take it , practising pie - eating late into the night on every street corner in @entity7 town centre			2
' dedicated athletes : participants take part in a heat			0
they are eating half pies , after the trainee chef given the job of delivering the pies to the competition accidentally brought along snacks of the wrong size safety first : the pies had to be halved to cut the chances of a dangerous ' swallow stall ' the cooked dimensions of the official competition pie should be a diameter of four - and - three - quarter inches and a depth of one - and - a - third inches , and a pie wall angle from base to top of between zero and 15 degrees			2
minimum content cube dimensions of the meat and potato mix are two - fifths of an inch , and they must have 66 per cent meat content , not including pastry .			0

the @entity7 went ahead anyway after pies were halved
@entity17 , 37 , a warehouse supervisor , won in a time of 42.6 seconds
the competition pies were instead delivered to a nearby divorce party
