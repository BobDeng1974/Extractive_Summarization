@entity0 today launched her bid to replace @entity2 as leader of the @entity4 , putting on course to be @entity7 's first female first minister			1
she is the clear favourite to succeed mr @entity2 , who dramatically quit on friday after voters rejected his dream of independence in the historic referendum			1
miss @entity0 said she wants to ' serve my party and my country ' and insisted she is the ' best person for the job '			2
he announced last friday that he would be stepping down from the job after @entity7 voted by 55 per cent to 45 per cent to remain in the @entity29			1
he said ' party , @entity31 and country would benefit from new leadership '			0
bookies immediately named @entity35 as the favorite to succeed him			0
today ms @entity0 said : ' to be the first minister of my country , especially at this exciting and optimistic time , would be both a great honour - without doubt , the greatest honour - and an immense responsibility			2
' i am putting myself forward for two simple reasons : i want to serve my party and my country			0
and i believe i am the best person for the job			0
' i also hope that my candidacy , should it succeed , will send a strong message to every girl and young woman in @entity7 : no matter your background or what you want to achieve in life , in @entity7 in 2014 there is no glass ceiling on ambition			0
' while ms @entity0 paid tribute to mr @entity2 , she was also keen to state : ' i will be my own person and set my own course			1
' at risk of stating the obvious , i am not @entity2			0
his are big boots to fill , but if given the opportunity to lead , i will wear my own shoes - and they will certainly have higher heels ! ' although she said the case for @entity27 having more powers was now ' urgent and irresistible ' , ms @entity0 stressed that if she becomes first minister , ' my responsibility will also be to use those powers we already have to make life better , now , for those we serve '			0
as she watched the results of the referendum at the @entity22 count in last week , @entity35 went from jubilation to reluctant acceptance of defeat as miss @entity0 announced her bid , @entity2 spent the day posing for photographs at the @entity85 at @entity86 miss @entity0 , 44 , is a former solicitor and is married to the @entity4 's chief executive @entity87			1
her almost - certain elevation to the top job raises the prospect of all the main parties in @entity7 being led by women			1
@entity93 is the conservative leader north of the border , while @entity96 's leader is @entity97			0
however , there has been speculation in recent days that miss @entity100 will quit after a lacklustre performance during the referendum campaign			0
at the party 's @entity105 conference in @entity107 there are strong rumours that miss @entity100 is ' ready ' to quit , although this was slapped down by her supporters			0
the party is bracing itself for more in - fighting and soul - searching following last week 's referendum			0
miss @entity0 's leadership bid will pit her against @entity96 's @entity97 ( left ) and conservative leader @entity93 former @entity7 secretary @entity114 is said to be already being lined up as the next leader			1
miss @entity0 has been an almost permanent fixture by mr @entity2 's side during his time in government			1
in his resignation speech on friday , mr @entity2 refused to be drawn on supporting a successor , but said ' party , @entity31 and country would benefit from new leadership '			0
he will quit as first minister after the @entity4 conference in @entity127 on november 15			2
' mr @entity2 said that at the age of 59 , after 20 years as @entity4 leader and seven years as first minister , it was time to hand over the reins			1
he said it was ' time to give someone else a chance to move that forward '			0
deputy first minister of scotland @entity0 smiles as she launches her leadership bid @entity2 likes a flutter , but he will get terrible odds on his likely successor			1
within minutes of the @entity4 leader announcing his decision to quit last week , bookies were as good as paying out on his deputy @entity0 taking the reins			1
she issued an almost comically - worded statement declaring that she could think of ' no greater privilege ' than to take the top job , before adding the decision was ' not for today '			2
the 44 - year - old former solicitor has been by @entity2 's side as his deputy for the last decade , forming what @entity96 's @entity97 today admitted was a ' formidable team '			2
she is married to the @entity4 's chief executive @entity87 , and with @entity2 and spin doctor @entity156 , they were the four party chieftains who guided the party from multiple election defeats to the brink of breaking up the @entity105			1
though she does not have children , her frequent appearances at schools and nurseries have helped to soften the blokey image of @entity2 's @entity4			2
@entity166 made @entity35 the 1/3 favourite to take over the @entity4 leadership			0
almost out of politeness , the bookies named other possible contenders including @entity172 , the @entity4 's successful election strategist , @entity174 , the @entity7 health secretary , and @entity176 , a local government minister			1
but in the contest to succeed racing fan @entity2 , @entity0 is the frontrunner in a one - horse race .			2

deputy first minister is the clear frontrunner to take the top job
@entity2 quit as @entity4 leader after defeat in the independence referendum
@entity0 insists she is the ' best person for the job ' in *confident* statement
55 *%* of *people* in @entity7 voted against @entity4 's dream of *separation*
