@entity1 premier @entity0 said he experimented with cannabis in his youth recently appointed @entity1 premier @entity0 has admitted to experimenting with @entity4 during an interview that canvasses his support for legalising the drug			1
the devout @entity8 and father of three , who succeeded former premier @entity10 in april , said he had used cannabis as a young person but was quick to dismiss it had any part to play in his life - other than as a one - off experiment			0
the @entity0 told the @entity17 in an interview to mark his 100th day since being thrust into the state 's top job , ' we 've all been young , so i 'm not going to deny i did experiment in my youth			1
' he made the remark when quizzed about decriminalising the drug for medicinal purposes in @entity1 , but said his own experience with drug - taking was neither ' pleasant ' nor ' regular '			1
' it 's got nothing to do with this issue anyway			0
' @entity0 supports legalising marijuana in @entity1 to help people cope with terminal illness @entity36 , pictured with his mother @entity37 , has found relief in cannabis during chemotherapy and a campaign to legalise the drug for terminally ill patients by his parents has more than 188,000 signatures the premier , and a number of @entity48 , have given in - principle support for legalising marijuana for terminally ill patients in the state after mr @entity0 visited a @entity53 cancer patient			1
@entity55 , a 24 - year - old , was told in 2010 that he only had months to live but begun taking cannabis as a pain coping mechanism to help him deal with the disease			1
he has made vast improvements in his health , his mother - a former head the north west @entity1 drug squad said , and she is now asking politicians to legalise the controversial drug			2
mr @entity0 said he was ' struck with @entity36 and the battle he 's in ' after meeting with him			2
' it 's heart - wrenching , ' he said			0
' i 've got deep sympathy and empathy with their position			0
' clinical trials of medicinal cannabis could happen in @entity1 , but mr @entity0 is waiting on details about regulation and supply before making any commitments			1
under a private member 's bill to be introduced next month by @entity82 mp @entity81 , terminally ill people and their carers will be legally able to carry up to 15 grams of cannabis			0
@entity53 man @entity55 is in a four - year battle with terminal bowel cancer and his parents are calling for cannabis to be legalised for treatment by the terminally ill asked if he would support a clinical trial , as proposed by the @entity91 , mr @entity0 said ' it may well be something we have to do '			1
' i 'm open to that , ' he told @entity97 on thursday			0
but mr @entity0 is waiting to see details of the bill and whether it will address his concerns about the sale and regulation of the drug			2
but if the bill satisfies mr @entity0 , it seems likely @entity36 and his family wo n't be forced to break the law for much longer			0
' if we can provide relief to them in those circumstance , well , what premier would not want to do that ? " mr @entity0 said			2
@entity1 opposition leader @entity114 said he 's willing to work with the government but , like mr @entity0 , wanted to see how the bill addresses things such as supply and access before fully endorsing it			1
' i 'm not writing a blank cheque , but i am very supportive of his notion , " he told reporters on last week			0
' if marijuana is part of the solution to dealing with those issues as a means of relieving people 's pain , then we should be looking at that			0

mr @entity0 made the remark in an interview on his 100th day as premier
he said it was an experiment he did not find ' pleasant '
mr @entity0 and other @entity1 *mps* support legalising cannabis for use in terminally ill patients
he was *inspired* by a 24 - year - old cancer patient who uses the drug as a pain coping mechanism
