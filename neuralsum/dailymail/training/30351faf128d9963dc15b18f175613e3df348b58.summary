researchers in @entity1 have discovered a huge population of ' unusually large ' chimps who feast on leopards and giant snails in what is being described as the continent 's ' last untouched wilderness '			1
the previously unknown ' mega-culture ' was found in the heart of the @entity12 in the @entity13 by researchers , who trekked thousands of miles dodging armed police and militia to get there			1
and they were stunned to see the chimps eating leopard and huge @entity22 snails , whose shells they pound open on rocks			1
scientists have discovered a huge mega-culture of chimps in @entity13 that feast on big cats and giant snails			1
regular chimps , pictured , mainly eat fruit @entity33 , a primatologist based at the @entity34 in @entity35 , @entity36 , said in @entity37 : ' this is one of the few places left on @entity39 with a huge continuous population of chimps			1
' we estimate many thousands of individuals , perhaps tens of thousands			0
' unique customs and behaviour across a vast area of 19,000sq miles were recorded by a series of motion - activated cameras			0
gangs of males were seen patrolling their territory and mothers showed their young how to use tools to eat swarming insects			0
the camera traps also revealed an extraordinary range of other forest dwellers , including forest elephants , olive baboons , spotted hyena as well as red river and giant forest hogs , crested guinea fowl and aardvark			2
@entity66 : researchers laid down a series of cameras to monitor the chimps ' behaviour and recorded them devouring a leopard such as this ' we saw incredible amounts of wildlife on our camera traps , but we did not catch a single film of a human , ' said @entity33			2
' it remains one of the last untouched wildernesses in @entity1			2
' one camera even recorded its own destruction as it came under attack from a leopard , but all two dozen cameras were nearly lost when poachers invaded the area and burned the researchers ' camp			0
only a swift two - day rescue mission retrieved the footage			0
@entity33 's team first identified the existence of the @entity12 chimps in 2007 but their new survey , published this week in the journal @entity99 , reveals a vast , thriving mega-culture			1
elsewhere in @entity1 , human damage has fragmented the continent 's chimp population from many millions to just a few hundred thousand over the last century			1
mission : the researchers trekked thousands of miles to reach the population , dodging armed police and militia in the troubled country however , while the chimp numbers have apparently remained stable , the numbers of forest elephants have crashed by half due to poaching			0
the slaughter , to feed the highly lucrative illegal ivory trade , mirrors the bloody picture across @entity1 , where two - thirds of all forest elephants have been killed in the last decade			0
the researchers fear increasing incursions into the virgin forest will draw in more hunters seeking to feed the bush meat trade in the @entity13 basin , that targets chimps and other animals			1
@entity33 said the @entity12 is in need of urgent help : ' it is one of the last great expanses of pristine @entity22 wilderness , ' he said			0
' this is one of the few places on @entity39 with a huge , continuous population of chimps '			2

the ' mega-culture ' of chimps also like eating giant snails whose shells they pound open on rocks
scientists found the ' unusually large ' animals in @entity13 and believe the *community* is *10,000* strong
they say the thriving population lives in one of the world 's ' last untouched wilderness '
