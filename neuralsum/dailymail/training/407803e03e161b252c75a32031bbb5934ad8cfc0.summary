concerns : mp @entity2 ¿ s views reflect growing concern within the @entity5 party about the proposals secret court hearings will hand a major propaganda victory to terrorists , a former security adviser to @entity11 has warned			1
senior @entity5 mp @entity2 said he had ‘ grave ’ concerns about the government ’s plans , which he warned would erode centuries of open justice			1
the former @entity20 officer , who served as the party ’s homeland security spokesman until 2007 , also claimed the measures would succeed in destroying @entity25 values – effectively doing the terrorists ’ job for them			1
he pointed out that @entity25 had successfully fought tyrannies throughout history without having to resort to secret court hearings			2
mr @entity2 ’s views reflect growing concern within the @entity5 party about the proposals , which extend ‘ closed material procedures ’ – ensuring cases are conducted behind closed doors – to any civil or inquest hearing			1
the comments came as it emerged ministers are preparing to backtrack over plans to allow ministers to decide which hearings can be conducted in secret			2
mr @entity2 said : ‘ my grave difficulty with this – particularly in cases of counter terrorism and security – is that any changes to what we have at the moment will erode the very thing for which we are fighting : freedom of speech , and free and open trials which are an immensely important element of @entity25 justice			1
‘ it is an element with which we fought tyrannies successfully down the years			2
we countered @entity62 , communism and @entity64 republicanism without having to resort to these sort of measures			2
' the point about terrorism and subversion is that it endeavours to change the way we live our lives and the tenets upon which we base our justice			2
‘ by imposing these changes upon ourselves , we are doing the subversives ’ jobs for them			0
’ open : the @entity79 , @entity80			0
a u-turn by ministers would be a significant step in the fight to maintain transparency in the @entity25 justice system , ruling out plans to allow inquests to be held in secret mr @entity2 also drew comparisons with the @entity92 courts in @entity93 , where cases were heard by a single judge without a jury			1
‘ while they satisfied the short term desire to put some terrorists behind bars , they laid us open to accusations of injustice and authoritarianism – the very things we were fighting , ’ he added			0
‘ they eventually ceased to operate because the propaganda value they handed to our opponents outweighed the usefulness of the product			0
i strongly suspect , having got as far as we have in the so - called war against terror , that to apply these changes to terrorist cases will be to shoot ourselves in the foot			0
’ mr @entity2 ’s remarks are another blow to the government ’s plans to extend ‘ secret justice ’			1
the @entity125 and @entity126 are refusing to back the proposals as they stand , meaning the draft @entity129 appears to have no chance of becoming law			1
the @entity132 has led criticism of plans for more secret courts as an affront to traditions of open justice			0
as the debate has grown increasingly fractious , justice secretary @entity139 and home secretary @entity140 have issued a last - ditch letter to @entity5 mps to boost support for the plans			1
the cabinet ministers have been accused of making ‘ spurious ’ claims that failing to back secret courts would lead to terror suspects being granted @entity25 passports			0
they have also claimed that @entity152 spies have been holding back on sharing information with @entity25 for fear it would end up in open court – a claim disputed by some security sources in @entity158			0
under the plans in the @entity161 green paper , defendants or claimants would not be allowed to be present , know or challenge the case against them and must be represented by a security - cleared advocate rather than their own lawyer			0
@entity170 ’s joint committee on human rights has produced a report damning the plans as ‘ inherently unfair and dangerous ’			0
senior sources have revealed that mr @entity139 is looking at backing away from allowing secret justice hearings in all but a ‘ tiny ’ number of terrorism cases .			1
