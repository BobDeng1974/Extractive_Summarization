' the gang escaped using two motorbikes , a motor scooter and a @entity160 car , all of which were @entity161 , who was still wearing his burka , and @entity163 , a getaway driver , were arrested when their moped crashed at the corner of @entity167 junction with @entity168 and they were seized by passers by , the court heard			0
