@entity0 has branded the @entity1 institutionally racist and claimed that he would have been @entity2 captain for 10 years if he had been white			1
the former @entity4 , @entity5 and @entity6 defender , who won 73 caps with @entity2 , makes the claim in his biography , which is published later this month			1
in it , he says he was overlooked for the captaincy , which was awarded to @entity12 , because of the colour of his skin			2
rare : @entity0 was captain for three friendly games in 1998 and 2005 but never received it long term @entity0 said : ' i believe that if i was white i would have been @entity2 captain for 10 years			1
' i do n't think it [ the situation ] will change because they do n't want it			0
it 's all right to have a black or mixed race captain of the @entity26 but not for the full national side			0
' there is a ceiling and , although no one has ever said it , i believe it 's made of glass			0
' @entity12 was made captain ahead of me and i thought , " what 's going on here ? " i think the @entity1 did n't want me to have a voice			1
' @entity12 was a fantastic forward but nowhere near being a captain			1
i 've asked myself many times why i was n't [ named captain ]			0
i keep coming up with the same answer			0
it was the colour of my skin			0
' influential : the former @entity4 , @entity5 and @entity6 defender won 73 caps with @entity2 back then : @entity0 celebrates scoring against @entity43 in the 2002 @entity44 leading role : @entity0 says @entity12 was a great striker but was not captain material for the @entity47 in charge : @entity49 ( left ) and @entity50 ( right ) have been given the armband during a game @entity0 was @entity2 captain for three friendly games in 1998 and 2005 but never received the captaincy long term			1
@entity57 21 @entity58 and @entity59 have also captained the side in short spells and @entity59 was captain going into the last @entity44 finals under @entity63 - before injury ruled him out			0
but @entity2 have never had an established black captain			2
the @entity1 are unlikely to respond directly to @entity0 's claim though they believe it to be untrue			1
however , it will raise the issue of race once again for @entity73 football 's governing body , following a week in which the @entity1 disciplinary panel were criticised for accepting that @entity76 had not intended to be anti-semitic when performing the now infamous ' quenelle ' salute after scoring for @entity79 against @entity80 last december			2
the @entity1 have also been criticised for the length of time it took to charge @entity76 and for the leniency of a four - game ban incurred by @entity86 after an @entity1 disciplinary panel found that he had racially abused @entity89			0
finally : @entity91 left - back @entity90 captains @entity2 against @entity92 in may after earning 100 caps leading the pack : @entity59 ( front centre ) is the only black player to be @entity2 's official leading captain			2

@entity0 claims the @entity1 is ' institutionally racist '
' if i was white i would have been @entity2 captain for 10 years '
former @entity4 , @entity5 and @entity6 defender won 73 @entity2 caps between 1996 and 2007
' @entity12 was a fantastic forward but nowhere near being a captain '
