@entity1 's booming housing market is making it harder for youngsters to get their first home young workers will get guaranteed cheap rent to allow them to save a deposit for their first home , under a new government scheme			1
the ' rent to buy ' programme will offer first - time buyers a 20 per cent discount off their rent for seven years			1
they will then be given the right to buy the home			2
the £ 400 million plan from communities secretary @entity18 aims to give young workers a ' springboard ' on to the property ladder without having to pay an expensive cash deposit at the start			1
the scheme is designed for single people earning £ 33,000 or less and couples on up to £ 66,000			1
local housing associations will run the scheme , but ministers will insist that the new one and two bed flats are given to ' hard - working ' people who have never owned a home			1
the proposal is the first part of a package to address the housing crisis , set to be unveiled at the party conference next week			0
it comes amid growing concerns over the length of time it takes to save for a deposit			2
it now takes an average first - time buyer 22 years to save enough for a deposit without their parents ' help			1
' the government is standing by people who work hard and do the right thing , and helping them move on and up in life , ' mr @entity18 said			1
under mr @entity18 ' proposals housing associations will compete for a share of £ 400 million of cheap government loans to build 10,000 homes over two years between 2015 and 2017			1
landlords of the flats will then be forced to keep their rents low to give young workers the time to build up a deposit so they can buy their place			1
@entity67 sources said that the scheme was aimed at ' aspiring professionals ' living with parents or friends who were finding it impossible to raise the deposit for a home			2
deposits can cost up to £ 60,000 for a two - bed property and most young people in their 20s or 30s can not afford the sum without help from their parents			1
mr @entity18 said : ' both house building and the number of first - time buyers are now at their highest rate since 2007			1
' as part of our wider housing programme this new scheme will help increase the provision of low - cost rented accommodation and provide a spring - board for young people to upgrade to home ownership down the line			1
' this government is taking action and supporting people who want to get on in life			0
' the @entity102 plans to do the opposite by introducing rent controls , compulsory registration and blanket local authority licensing which would destroy private and institutional investment in the rented sector , push up rents and reduce choice and supply			0
' communities secretary @entity18 hopes the ' rent to buy ' scheme will make it easier for youngsters to save for a deposit under the scheme , housing associations will have up to 16 years to pay back the low - cost loans , and until these are repaid the homes have to be available at below market rents			1
after seven years , tenants will be able to buy the home for the market price , move out and buy another property or rent an - other home , either privately or with the housing association			1
@entity127 , of the @entity128 , said : ' we welcome any measure which can help to accelerate the supply of new homes			0
' however , we still need more clarity about what the policy aims to achieve			0
we are concerned most tenants will be unlikely to be able to afford to buy after seven years and we need to consider how we will meet their long - term housing needs			2
' getting the right mortgage is essential to making sure buying a home is as affordable as possible			0
