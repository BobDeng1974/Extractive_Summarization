by @entity0 published : 07:23 est , 8 february 2013 updated : 14:39 est , 25 february 2013 @entity2 space scientists are gearing up to launch the world 's first satellite run entirely using a mobile phone			1
the unique @entity7 satellite , developed by researchers from the @entity9 , will be fully controlled by a @entity11 phone during part of its six - month space mission			1
it will launch into a 785km sun - synchronous orbit on the @entity18 's @entity17 ( @entity17 ) from @entity19 , @entity20 , on february 25			1
you 'd expect to see an @entity22 in space ... a @entity2 team is set to launch the first satellite controlled by a smartphone			1
the @entity7 satellite will be controlled by a @entity11 during part of its space mission the satellite 's launch will be an interesting test of the oft - repeated claim that the mobile phone in your pocket has more computing power than was used to send a man to the @entity39			1
at the heart of @entity7 is an unmodified @entity42 smartphone running an @entity22 operating system , according to dr @entity44 , the @entity45 's lead engineer on the venture			1
' we have n't gutted the @entity11			0
we 've done lots and lots of tests on it ; we 've put our own software on it			0
but we 've essentially got a regular phone , connected up the usb to it and put it in the satellite , ' he told the @entity59			2
the smartphone is pressed up against a side panel of the 30cm - long , 4.3kg cubesat , so that it 's @entity64 camera can look out and take pictures of the @entity66 and the @entity39			2
world first : the @entity7 cubesat during final assembly and test phase december 2012			1
the camera on its @entity11 ' heart ' is visible through the porthole at the top of the stack the @entity7 ( which stands for @entity75 and @entity76 ) is a joint project between @entity45 and @entity78 , a world leader in small commercial spacecraft			1
modern smartphones contain advanced technologies and incorporate several key features that are essential to satellites like cameras , radio links , accelerometers and high performance computer processors			0
add in solar panels and propulsion systems and that 's almost everything a spacecraft needs to fly			1
during the first phase of the mission , @entity7 will use a number of experimental ' apps ' to collect data whilst a new high - speed linux - based @entity100 computer developed by @entity102 takes care of the satellite			1
in phase two , the @entity7 team plan to switch the satellite 's in - orbit operations to the smartphone , thereby testing the capabilities of a number of standard smartphone components for a space environment			1
@entity7 - 1 in a vacuum chamber during prelaunch testing : researchers say it has been subjected to oven and freezer temperatures , to a vacuum and blasted with radiation to make sure it will cope schematic : this graphic shows the various parts of the @entity7 during the summer of 2011 , the @entity7 team ran a @entity127 competition to find apps to be loaded onto the satellite 's @entity42 smartphone prior to its launch			1
the winners are : @entity134 , which will record the magnitude of the magnetic field around the phone during orbit			0
used as a precursor to further scientific studies , such as detecting @entity144 waves ( magnetic oscillations in our upper atmosphere ) , the @entity140 app could provide proof of principle			0
the @entity151 app , which will show satellite telemetry on the smartphone 's display which can be imaged by an additional camera on - board			1
this will enable new graphical telemetry to interpret trends			0
postcards from @entity161 and 360 are joint winners , using an app that will take images using the smartphone 's camera and use the technology onboard the spacecraft to establish @entity7 's position			2
the public will be able to request their own unique satellite image of @entity66 through a website , where images can be seen on a map showing where they have been acquired			2
the scream in @entity161 app will make full use of the smartphone 's speakers			0
testing the theory ' in space no - one can hear you scream , made popular in the 1979 film ' @entity188 ' , the app will allow the public to upload videos of themselves screaming in a creative way to an allocated website			2
the most popular videos will be played on the phone while in orbit and the scream recorded using the smartphone 's microphone			0
dr @entity44 added : ' a smartphone on a satellite like this has never been launched before but our tests have been pretty thorough , subjecting the phone to oven and freezer temperatures , to a vacuum and blasting it with radiation			2
' it has a good chance of working as it should , but you can never make true design evolutions or foster innovation without taking a few risks			0
@entity7 is cool because it allows us to do just that			2
' the satellite will be commissioned and operated from the @entity45 's ground station at the @entity9			0
being the first smartphone satellite in orbit is just one of many ' firsts ' that @entity7 is hoping to achieve			1
another important mission is the testing of two new propulsion technologies			0
the first , known as the @entity229 - jet @entity228 ( which benefits from the grand acronym @entity230 ) , will use the ejection of a water alcohol mixture to provide thrust			0
the second is its @entity235 that use an electric current to heat and ablate a material to produce a charged gas which can then be accelerated by a magnetic field to push the cubesat along			0
although both propulsion systems produce only tiny amounts of thrust they interesting for their fuel efficiency			1
@entity245 , head of science for @entity78 , said : ' we 've deliberately asked this enthusiastic and talented young team to do something very non-standard in terms of the timescales , processes and the technologies used to put the satellite together because we want to maximise what we learn from this research programme			0
' i ca n't wait to see what happens next			0
' @entity259 is already in development .			0

@entity7 is *due* to launch from @entity19 , @entity20 , on february 25
it is controlled by a @entity42 *handset* running @entity22
satellite will also test two new fuel - efficient propulsion systems
