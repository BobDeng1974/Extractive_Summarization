by @entity1 medical correspondent published : 17:30 est , 28 may 2013 updated : 10:15 est , 31 may 2013 patients who undergo planned operations at the weekend rather than a monday are 82 per cent more likely to die			2
shocking findings show that death rates for elective procedures increase throughout the working week			1
this will add to mounting concern about @entity10 patients receiving poor care during ‘ antisocial ’ hours when consultants are off duty			0
the study has led to calls for a rethink on whether elective surgery should take place at the weekend the study suggests for the first time that some weekdays are safer than others , with friday and the weekend being most hazardous for planned surgery			1
researchers from @entity25 looked at four million elective operations in @entity10 hospitals in @entity28 between 2008 and 2011 with at least one night spent in hospital			1
elective surgery normally involves procedures such as heart bypass , hip and knee replacements , gastric operations and hysterectomies			1
altogether 27,500 patients died within 30 days of surgery , with the risk lowest for those having it on monday and rising on each subsequent day of the week			1
the extra risk on tuesday was minimal , but went up to 15 per cent on wednesday , 21 per cent for thursday patients and 44 per cent on friday ( all compared with monday )			2
almost one in 20 operations was performed at a weekend , when the increased risk reached 82 per cent , said the study published online at bmj.com			2
the study found that the risk from elective operations in the @entity10 increased throughout the week lead researcher dr @entity50 said : ‘ the first 48 hours after an operation are often the most critical period of care for surgery patients			1
a failure to rescue the patient could be due to well - known issues relating to reduced and / or locum staffing and poorer availability of staff over a weekend			0
’ frailer patients were at even higher risk at weekends			0
dr @entity63 said : ‘ unlike previous studies , we included both deaths in hospital and deaths after discharge , so this eliminates a potential bias of counting only in - hospital deaths			0
' we tried to account for the possibility that different types of patients might have operations at the end of the week , but our adjustment made little difference			0
‘ this leaves us with the possibility that the differences in mortality rates are due to poorer quality of care at the weekend , perhaps because of less availability of staff , resources and diagnostic services			0
’ the @entity25 study found frailer patients were even more at risk at weekends health secretary @entity92 last week condemned the scandal of out - of - hours care health secretary @entity92 last week condemned the scandal of out - of - hours care , with patients seldom able to see their own gp as opposed to locum doctors ‘ who do n’t know you from @entity102 ’			1
@entity104 doctors writing a commentary on the study said there should be a rethink on whether any elective surgery should take place at the weekend			1
they wrote : ‘ although emergency procedures such as the repair of ruptured aortic aneurysms can not be controlled , the scheduling of elective procedures , such as knee replacements , is wholly within our control			2
‘ if weekend care proves to deliver poorer outcomes than its weekday counterpart , it might be argued that elective procedures should not be scheduled at weekends at all			2
’ previous research found that hundreds of deaths could be avoided every year by putting consultants in charge of care , regardless of the day of the week			0
@entity128 , chief executive of the @entity129 , said : ‘ we know of cases where patients get admitted on a friday night and , if there ’s a bank holiday , they do n’t get any proper care until tuesday morning because of the lack of experienced staff and diagnostic facilities			0
‘ quite apart from the human cost , this costs the @entity10 because they may need more treatment as a result			0

study found death rates for elective procedures increase through the week
@entity25 looked at four million elective @entity10 operations
