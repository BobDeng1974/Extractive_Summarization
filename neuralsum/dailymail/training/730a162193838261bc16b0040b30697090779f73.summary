@entity3 midfielder @entity2 ’s @entity1 dream came to a painful and public end at @entity5 after he broke his left leg against the @entity7			1
@entity2 was captaining his country with coach @entity9 resting many of his big - name players from this warm - up game before they face @entity13 in @entity14 on june 14			1
the 29 - year - old enjoyed the honour for just 13 minutes until he was tackled by @entity17 within touching distance of the dugout - in front of @entity13 ’s @entity21 and @entity22 , watching from the @entity24 directors ’ box			1
worried : @entity3 captain @entity2 was injured in the friendly against @entity7 painful : @entity2 came off worse in a challenge with @entity7 defender @entity17 in the first - half the @entity30 captain briefly got to his feet and took a few steps before collapsing in agony			1
he was treated by paramedics on the pitch for three minutes as concerned teammates stood over him			0
a grimace suggested he knew that his hopes of making it to a second @entity1 were over			2
he appeared to mouth ‘ @entity41 , ’ - ‘ i ’ve broken it ’ - to the bench			2
he was later confirmed to have fractured the tibia bone in his left leg			2
instead of travelling with his teammates to their training camp in @entity47 , he spent the night at @entity49 and @entity50 hospital and will be flown to @entity30 on sunday for emergency surgery			0
‘ all our thoughts are for @entity2 , ’ said @entity9 later			1
‘ he is a key player , so everybody is really cut up			0
they ’re so upset right now			0
he has a really good attitude			0
he ’s such a great personality on and off the pitch and i think all the lads were really shocked			0
‘ obviously after what happened the players were distracted , psychologically it is difficult to move on			0
it is too emotional to consider now how it affects the squad			0
’ injury : @entity2 received treatment on the pitch before eventually leaving on a stretcher something to prove : @entity3 coach @entity9 named a changed side for the game against @entity7 before the injury , @entity2 seemed almost certain to make @entity9 ’s 23 - man party , expected to be announced sunday , and he was likely to have featured in the starting xi in the first game in @entity78 the player , who made seven appearances for the @entity3 during the qualifying campaign , would have been an important cog in @entity3 ’s attack and a valuable experienced presence in the camp			1
@entity3 remain without a victory since september , after five draws and a defeat to @entity88			2
it is difficult to pinpoint how useful @entity21 will have found last night ’s game in gauging the challenge @entity13 will face when they open their @entity1 campaign in @entity93			1
it was an experimental line - up with the players who are likely to provide the biggest threat to @entity13 left on the bench			1
@entity98 , the 35 - year - old midfield maestro who was probably on @entity100 soil in an @entity3 shirt for the final time , did not play			1
the 22,879 crowd , a fairly even split of @entity3 blue and @entity106 tricolour , witnessed several fabulous passes by @entity108 after his introduction on 62 minutes			1
@entity110 man : @entity111 was named on the bench for @entity3 's game against @entity7 safe hands : experienced goalkeeper @entity115 was another player named on the bench for @entity3 @entity115 , at 36 still one of the world ’s best goalkeepers , was rested although his deputy @entity120 did a superb job of thwarting several @entity7 shots			1
‘ he was the biggest positive for me , ’ said @entity9			2
@entity7 were boisterous opponents committed to every tackle			0
@entity127 ’s @entity126 exposed frailties in the @entity130 defence , getting the better of @entity131 on several occasions			0
‘ i thought we played very well , ’ said manager @entity133			2
‘ @entity3 started off well but i thought we could have scored a few goals			2
when i heard there was going to be 20,000 people here , i realised nobody was taking this as a friendly			0
it was very competitive from start to finish			0
’ @entity133 expects the future of his assistant @entity142 — a @entity144 target — to be decided before @entity106 fly to @entity145 on wednesday where they face @entity147 and @entity148			0
wanted man : @entity7 coach @entity142 has been linked with the manager 's job at @entity144 scouting mission : @entity13 boss @entity21 took the opportunity to watch @entity1 opponents @entity3			1
