a police force has admitted they were told @entity2 was a paedophile nearly a decade before his horrific crimes came to light , @entity5 can reveal			1
@entity7 @entity6 have disclosed that a journalist called them in 2003 with information that an unnamed victim had been abused by @entity2 as a child in @entity12 â€“ but the force did nothing with the information			1
the call only emerged after an examination of police phone records in november last year , long after @entity2 was unmasked as the @entity20 's most notorious paedophile			1
the 2003 call came in the middle of @entity35 , an investigation which led to former pop mogul @entity37 and dj @entity38 being convicted of child abuse			2
records show that police operators asked the journalist to encourage the victim to contact them or the @entity45			1
but @entity7 said no crime record was created as ' no direct allegation was ever received ' and @entity2 was not a suspect in the @entity35 inquiry			1
the new revelation is hugely embarrassing for the force , who previously admitted they identified @entity2 as a potential abuser in 2007 , but botched the subsequent investigation			1
@entity2 was interviewed by @entity7 officers about sexual assault allegations			0
but no charges were brought after the @entity59 advised there was insufficient evidence @entity2 was interviewed under caution by @entity7 officers that year about sexual assault allegations dating back to the 1970s			2
but no charges were brought after the @entity59 advised there was insufficient evidence			0
it has since emerged that @entity7 officers overlooked key evidence during the investigation , codenamed @entity69 , from 2007 to 2009			0
it was only during a 2012 review that the force discovered the 2003 call , but when the force then published a report on the review last january , it failed to mention it			2
the omission was spotted in november 2013 and led to the force referring the matter to the @entity81 , which oversaw the investigation but cleared @entity7 of any wrongdoing			0
the @entity5 understands the blunder led @entity7 to commission an independent report by @entity86 , which is currently being assessed			0
but last night @entity88 mp @entity87 said : ' this is yet another revelation showing the casual attitude of police towards this crime at the time			0
it 's important we know why information relating to credible tip - offs was not acted on so we can establish what the police knew about @entity2			1
only then will we be able to learn lessons so that other powerful abusers can not slip through the net			0
' a @entity6 spokesman said : ' the call from the journalist came during the force 's investigation into historical sexual offences known as @entity109			1
@entity2 was not a suspect in this investigation			2
' material relating to @entity35 has been shared with @entity113 as part of their on - going enquiries			0
@entity6 commissioned an independent external review of @entity35 by @entity86 and are in the process of assessing a report from that			0
