lurking in the shadows in his body armour and balaclava , neighbourhood vigilante and self - styled ninja @entity0 considered himself the eyes and ears of the police			1
until , that is , he was spotted loitering in a park by an officer who mistook the black - clad crimebuster ’s trusty wooden sword for something more lethal			0
within minutes the officer had called for back - up and – as @entity0 retreated towards a children ’s playground – a police helicopter , armed officers and dog handlers were all scrambled			1
superhero : how @entity0 might have looked when he was arrested while dressed as a vigilante ninja @entity0 – nicknamed the @entity27 by locals in the suburb of @entity30 , @entity31 , where he lives – was eventually found crouching in the bushes			1
he then sheepishly led officers to a bag full of smoke bombs which he had stashed nearby , while another bag was found to contain other superhero costumes			1

he claimed to be the ‘ eyes and ears ’ of the police and wanted to strike fear into the hearts of criminals			1
the probation officer who assessed him said @entity0 was a fan of @entity79 comic book superheroes			2
his probation report said : ‘ he seems to get confused between fantasy and reality and sometimes had trouble distinguishing between what was in comic books and what was real life			0
’ the court heard he had been crouched on top of the park gates in his costume keeping watch for criminals when he was spotted by the police officer who feared he was carrying a samurai sword			1
