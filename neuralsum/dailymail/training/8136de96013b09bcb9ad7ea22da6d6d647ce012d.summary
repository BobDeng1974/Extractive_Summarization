by @entity0 published : 00:37 est , 18 november 2013 updated : 03:30 est , 18 november 2013 the @entity2 's composer has attacked the state of music teaching in @entity5 , branding it ' disgraceful ' that so many young people do not know who @entity7 is			1
sir @entity9 , master of the queen 's music , said it was both ' a disgrace ' and ' a shock ' that so many youngsters had now never even heard of @entity7 or @entity14 - let alone listened to their music			1
he blamed successive governments for treating classical music as ' an elitist fringe activity			1
' the 79 - year - old musician , rated as the world 's greatest living composer , says it 's shocking that youngsters do not know @entity7 it now means that both he and acclaimed violinist @entity25 in have warned about the dangers of a generation growing up ignorant of the world 's greatest works			1
he said he backed ' to the hilt ' ms @entity25 in calling for every young person to be ' made ' to study classical works to help them understand humanity			1
the @entity36 - based 79 - year - old musician , rated as the world 's greatest living composer , said ms @entity25 , who recently worked with about 200 young musicians at the @entity39 , had done ' a great service ' in highlighting the issue			1
@entity25 said it was ridiculous that classical music was marginalised in schools because of the perception that children do not find it ' fun ' ' i think she is a great ambassador and role model and absolutely right , ' said sir @entity9 , who recently was given the all clear after a cancer battle			1
' i step down as master of the queen 's music in march but i plan to concentrate my time on helping to make classical music more accessible to young people			1
we are in grave danger of losing - through not learning or experiencing - centuries of a wealth of wisdom and works			0
' there are hundreds of thousands of youngsters who now have never even heard of @entity7 or @entity14			0
it is shocking and a disgrace that has been allowed to happen			0
' the same applies to @entity64 and @entity65			0
it just shows what has gone wrong with areas of the educational system			0
' i do n't think the problem is limited to ' right or left ' governments and councils			2
i 'm afraid successive governments and local authorities have seen classical music as an elitist fringe activity			1
' but it has been shown time and again that learning to play a classical instrument - or sing - makes you much cleaver , more confident and a better team player , as well as many other benefits			2
' in this day and age when every bit of information is accessible through the internet to anybody who has a computer , the role of the creative arts has never been more important			0
' if the same information is available to everyone , the challenge is who can use it the most creatively ? that 's why classical music is probably more relevant in today 's society than it is has ever been - it hone 's people 's creativity , not just as musicians			1
' playing a musical instrument promotes a child 's self - esteem by improving several key skills and habits - and i think all children should be made to study classical works			1
we are at a serious tipping point			0
we are in danger of centuries of learning being lost to the dubious influences of vacuous celebrity culture and inane talent shows			0
' teachers ' should be encouraged to take children through symphonies and explain the form in detail ' , the musicians claim ' if there is one thing i believe passionately about it is that children should have free access to learning an instrument			0
' i am furious that some councils think it is perfectly acceptable to charge for instrument tuition			0
it is not - they are shameless and are unnecessarily limiting the life chances of those who can least afford it			0
many young people do n't even recognise the works of some of the world 's greatest composers such as @entity7 ( pictured ) and @entity14 ' it goes against the very ethos of widening music across all social classes			1
the danger is that music becomes the preserve of the better off - the parents who can afford to pay - while talented children from poorer families miss out			2
' recently @entity151 - born ms @entity25 said ' there should be a substantial amount of complex great music in schools			2
it 's insane to me that there is n't			2
' she said teachers should be encouraged to take children through symphonies from @entity14 and @entity163 to @entity164 and @entity165 and explain the form in detail			0
' every single young person in this country should be made - within the context of their school curriculum - to listen to the greatest classical works , ' she said			2
the 26 - year - old musician , who last month won the best female artist at the @entity176 , said it was ridiculous that classical music was marginalised in schools because of the perception that children do not find it ' fun			1
' ' since when did everything have to be fun ? music can be fun and enjoyable , but it also provides a way to go as deep as you can into our history and our understanding of humanity ; of our expression and growth as people , ' she said			2
' it makes me sad , the gross misunderstanding of its potential and power and influences			0
' in the @entity201 , ms @entity25 was as a appointed @entity202 for services to music and charity .			0
