in the @entity36 there is no legislation to control hypnotherapy and nothing to stop so - called ‘ hypno - cowboys ’ with little or no experience			0
practitioners can affiliate to one of a plethora of organisations such as the @entity47 , @entity48 or the @entity49 and @entity50 , which require members to abide by a code of practice			0
