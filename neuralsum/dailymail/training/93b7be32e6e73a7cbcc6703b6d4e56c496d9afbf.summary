by @entity0 published : 23:48 est , 26 may 2013 updated : 02:29 est , 27 may 2013 veterans in suburban @entity2 gathered in a park to mark @entity4 this year rather than hold a parade because of failing health and dwindling numbers			1
the city of @entity9 called off its parade this year because so few veterans would be able to march			1
the parade has been a fixture in the town since the @entity15			1
aging population : with most wwii veterans now in their 90s , fewer are able to take part in parades and there seems to be little interest from veterans from younger generations in certain areas @entity26 , white & blue : a couple photograph themselves amongst a sea of flags on @entity31 in @entity2			1
the flags were placed by the @entity32 in memory of every fallen @entity35 service member from the @entity15 to the present			1
@entity38 veteran @entity37 tells @entity39 he hates canceling because of the message it sends to current service members			0
but he does understand the reason			2
many veterans who were gathered at the @entity45 this weekend are upset by the decision			1
' it ’s not right to me , ' says @entity37			0
he is a @entity38 veteran who has not only marched in the city ’s @entity4 parade in the past , he says he has also been its grand marshal			0
he hates to cancel because of the message it sends to men and women serving now			0
in our own way : the town of @entity9 in @entity35 has cancelled its @entity60 for the first time since the civil war because of its aging veteran population remembering : @entity64 looks over a field of crosses with names while participating in the @entity68 in @entity69			0
@entity64 made the crosses , 137 , for all the service members that were killed from the @entity15 to the @entity38 ' it ’s a slap in the face to them that we ’re not doing it , ' he says			1
' but on the other hand , i can see why we ’re not doing it because of the age of the veterans we have now			0
' that gets to the heart of the problem			0
in @entity9 , there just are not enough veterans alive who are well enough to march in the parade anymore			1
as for younger veterans – like the men and women who have served in @entity90 or @entity91 – they are often too busy to take part			1
@entity94 veteran @entity93 tells @entity95 he 's upset about parade cancellation but ' there are n't that many of us left			1
' ' my wife and i have both been quoted as saying we are upset by the whole thing , ' said @entity93			0
there are veterans that are ok with the fact there is no longer a parade			2
people like the town 's veteran 's organizer @entity111 he says it can be difficult for older vets to take part			2
' it 's not about parades and down the street and waving flags , it is about what we did all week long , spending countless hundreds of hours putting flags on every veteran 's grave , and remembering who they were , ' said @entity111			0
calm : some veterans are fine without there being a parade			2
showing their support in other ways , such as placing flags on the graves of the fallen , can help the show must go on : other parades still take part in many towns and cities across the country			1
a float passes by during the @entity143 in @entity69 @entity144 is the town 's oldest veteran , at 93 , he recalls those who were lost			0
' that people remember , who left and never came back , which is a lot of them , that 's who i remember , ' said @entity144			2
@entity144 's daughter @entity153 , believes that it is about more than older vets who can no longer march a mile			0
' it 's a little bit of a reflection to people who are in younger generations not really realizing how many people fought for us and how hard life was for them to make life great for us , ' she said			2
' it ’s very disappointing to me ; i think it ’s a shame , ' says @entity168 , a local veteran who served in @entity169			0
' hopefully maybe next year we can change that			0
' city officials think that if enough veterans come forward to participate next year , or if the city can come up with another way to have them be a part of the parade , then the city will bring it back .			1

lack of veterans cited as reason for cancelling parade for first time since the @entity15
younger veterans are often too busy to take part
those upset by the decision find other ways to remember @entity193 's fallen
