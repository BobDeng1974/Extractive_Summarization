by @entity0 published : 12:34 est , 23 july 2013 updated : 04:07 est , 24 july 2013 @entity2 holders stand less of a chance of winning a payout after @entity5 announced that it was cutting prize payouts			1
@entity5 will reduce the annual @entity2 prize fund rate from 1.5 per cent to 1.3 per cent from the start of next month , it revealed this morning			1
the cut means the odds of each £ 1 @entity13 number winning a prize will lengthen to 26,000 to 1 from 24,000 to 1 for the 22million investors who hold them			1
@entity17 cut : the number of @entity2 prizes will fall drastically in august after becoming ' too attractive ' to savers the total prize pot this month is £ 57.1million			1
in august , this will fall to £ 49.3million – an almost 14 per cent cut			1
the total number of prizes will fall by more than 150,000 , from 1.9million to 1.75million			1
there will still be a £ 1million jackpot , but the number of winners of other prizes will dwindle			2
the number of £ 100,000 winners will fall from five this month to three in august , while the £ 50,000 winners will drop from nine to six and £ 25,000 from 20 to 11			1
@entity34 , chief executive of @entity5 , told this is money : ‘ we agonised over the decision to reduce returns on @entity39			2
it 's not something we undertook lightly			0
less chance : those with @entity2 now have less chance of winning a payout in the annual prize draw ' rates across the savings market have fallen over recent months , resulting in @entity5 savings being increasingly attractive , but it 's important to note that we have not altered the terms since 2009			2
' the cut to the prize fund is 20 basis points but this is far below the cuts that have been made among our private sector competitors			2
‘ to ensure we stay within our net financing target – and in light of our framework to balance the needs of our savers , taxpayers and the stability of the broader financial services sector - we now need to reduce the @entity2 prize fund rate			1
’ instead of paying interest , @entity2 are entered into monthly prize draws to win prizes from £ 25 to £ 1million			2
the monthly prize fund is set by calculating one month ’s interest on the total value of all eligible @entity13 , at the annual prize fund rate			1
@entity5 sets its interest rates and the @entity13 prize fund rate , it says , to balance the interest of its savers , taxpayers and the stability of the broader financial services sector			1
it must not make its rates or chances of winning too attractive as this would distort the market for private sector savings providers			0
it sets a target each year for the total it wants to take in through deposits and @entity2 purchases			0
it has taken the decision to reduce the @entity2 prize fund rate to stay within its net financing range for 2013 - 14			1
£ 1million 1 £ 100,000 5 3 £ 50,000 9 6 £ 25,000 20 11 £ 10,000 49 30 £ 5,000 97 58 £ 1,000 1,142 789 £ 500 3,426 2.367 £ 100 33,552 11,891 £ 50 33,552 11,891 £ 25 1,831,461 1,724,014 @entity5 said today that @entity2 had become ‘ too attractive ’ in the light of falling savings rates from banks and building societies			2
in the first quarter of 2013 - 14 ( april - june ) @entity5 attracted net £ 1.7billion of premium bond sales against a target of net £ 0 , with a range of £ 2billion either side of this			2
the inflows show how popular the product has become as savers struggle to find a decent return			0
interest rates have fallen over recent months in the savings sector , resulting in @entity5 savings being increasingly competitive			0
lower value : the prize payouts for the @entity2 draw has been cut by @entity5 the reduction in the @entity2 prize fund rate reflects current lower interest rates across the savings market , @entity5 says			1
last month , @entity5 announced it was reducing the interest rates on its @entity125 , @entity126 and @entity127 with effect from 12 september 2013			0
@entity129 , easy - access and fixed - rate savings rates from private sector providers have all fallen in the last 12 months as a direct consequence of the funding for lending scheme			0
this has enabled banks and building societies to tap into cheap money from the government , rather than rely on savers			0
@entity5 and @entity2 are government - backed - and many experts will argue this is yet another attack on savers			0
despite the average return dropping from 1.5 per cent to 1.3 per cent , @entity2 still represent a good bet versus savings accounts			0
premium bond returns are tax - free so , for 20 per cent taxpayers a 1.3 per cent return on @entity2 is equivalent to 1.62 per cent on savings , and for 40 per cent taxpayers the equivalent return rises to 2.16 per cent			0
currently , the best buy easy - access account is 1.6 per cent from @entity154 , while the best two - year fix is 2.3 per cent from @entity156			0
cash isas are tax - free - and there are a number of accounts that pay over 1.3 per cent .			0

@entity5 to reduce prize fund rate from 1.5 per cent to 1.3 per cent
the change means that odds of winning will rise to 26,000/1
the prize pot will fall by almost 14 per cent next month to £ 49.3million
the total number of prizes dished out will fall by more than 150,000
