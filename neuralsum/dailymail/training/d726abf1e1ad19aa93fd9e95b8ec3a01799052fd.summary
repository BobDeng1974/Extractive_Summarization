by @entity0 published : 16:18 est , 2 december 2013 updated : 20:26 est , 2 december 2013 doctors are aiming to lower the epidemic of twins after it was revealed nearly half of all babies born with advanced fertility help are multiple births			1
in the five years since the @entity9 case , big multiple births have decreased but the twin rate has barely budged			2
twins have much higher risks of prematurity and serious health problems , leading fertility experts to attempt pregnancy with a single embryo to cut back the chance of conceiving multiples - however it will add an extra $ 4,000 to the $ 14,000 cost for @entity22			1
@entity23 , left , and his wife @entity24 , right , from @entity25 , conceived their baby using only one embryo during @entity22 fertility experts will also be helped by new ways to pick the single embryos that are most likely to succeed			1
new guidelines urge doctors to stress this approach			2
better ways to screen embryos can make success rates for single embryos nearly as good as when two or more are used the new techniques include maturing the embryos a few days longer			1
that improves viability and allows cells to be sampled for chromosome screening			1
embryos can be frozen to allow test results to come back and more precisely time the transfer to the womb			2
taking these steps with single embryos results in fewer miscarriages and tubal pregnancies , healthier babies with fewer genetic defects and lower hospital bills from birth complications , many fertility specialists say			1
multiple studies back this up			0
in may , doctors from the @entity25 clinics did the kind of research considered a gold standard			2
they randomly assigned 175 women to have either a single embryo transferred after chromosome screening or two embryos with no screening , as is done in most @entity22 attempts now			1
@entity24 poses with her two - month - old daughter , @entity69 , in their @entity71 , @entity25 home , after undergoing @entity22 with just one embryo delivery rates were roughly equivalent , 61 percent with single embryos and 65 percent with doubles			1
more than half of the double transfers produced twins but none of the single ones did			1
chromosome testing and freezing embryos adds about $ 4,000 to the roughly $ 14,000 cost for @entity22 , ' but the pregnancy rates go up dramatically ' , and that saves money because fewer @entity22 attempts are needed , dr. @entity82 , scientific director for @entity83 of @entity25 said			1
@entity24 and @entity23 of @entity71 , @entity25 , did this to conceive @entity69 , a daughter born in september			0
using one embryo at a time ' just seemed the most normal , the most natural way ' to conceive and avoid a high - risk twin pregnancy , the new mom said			2
not all couples feel that way , though			0
some can only afford one try with in vitro fertilization , or @entity22 , so they insist that at least two embryos be used to boost their odds , and view twins as two for the price of one			1
many patients ' are telling their physicians ' i want twins , '' said @entity109 , president of @entity110 , a support and advocacy group			2
' we as a society think twins are healthy and always come out great			2
there 's very little reality ' about the increased medical risks for babies and moms , she said			0
the @entity123 's most recent numbers show that 46 percent of @entity22 babies are multiples , mostly twins , and 37 percent are born premature			1
a doctor is seen analyzing an embryo on an @entity129 at a reproductive center ( stock library image ) by comparison , only three percent of babies born without fertility help are twins and about 12 percent are preterm			1
it 's mostly an @entity141 problem , some @entity138 countries that pay for fertility treatments require using one embryo at a time			1
the @entity144 is trying to make it the norm in the @entity141 , too			0
its guidelines , updated earlier this year , say that for women with reasonable medical odds of success , those under 35 should be offered single embryo transfer and no more than two at a time			1
the number rises with age , to two or three embryos for women up to 40 , since older women have more trouble conceiving			0
to add heft to the advice , the guidelines say women should be counseled on the risks of multiple births and embryo transfers and that this discussion should be noted in their medical records			1
' in 2014 , our goal is really to minimize twins , ' said dr. @entity172 , medical director of @entity83 of @entity173 , a @entity175 fertility clinic			2
' this year i 'm talking about two versus one			0
several years ago i was talking about three versus two ' embryos			0
the one - at - a - time idea is catching on			0
only four percent of women under 35 used single embryos in 2007 but nearly 12 percent did in 2011			2
it 's less common among older women , who account for fewer ivf pregnancies , but it is gaining among them , too			0
' patients do n't really want multiples			0
what they want is high delivery rates , ' said dr. @entity82 babies from double transfers were more likely to be premature ; more than one - third spent time in a neonatal intensive care unit versus 8 percent of the others			0
using two or more embryos carries a much higher risk of twins and much higher rates of cerebral palsy and other disorders			1
after explaining the risks , ' this is the easiest thing in the world to convince patients to do , ' @entity82 said of screening and using single embryos			1
but dr. @entity205 of the @entity206 in @entity207 , @entity208 , found otherwise			0
for a study , he offered 48 couples free medications and embryo freezing if they would agree to transfer one at a time instead of two			2
eighteen couples refused , including one - quarter of those whose insurance was covering the treatment			0
some who refused said they viewed twins as two for the price of one			0
' i tell my patients twins are not twice the fun , ' @entity223 said			0
' one is hard enough			0
two at a time is a killer for some people			0
some marriages do n't survive this			0
' the @entity25 couple , who had a daughter using a single embryo , has eight more frozen embryos			1
when it 's time to try again , @entity24 said , ' we would do the same thing ' and use one at a time			0

doctors aim to lower the rate by attempting fertility with just a single embryo
the new techniques include maturing the embryos a few days longer
maturing and freezing embryos improves viability and allows cells to be sampled for chromosome screening
chromosome testing and freezing embryos adds about $ 4,000 to the roughly $ 14,000 cost for @entity22
twins have much higher risks of prematurity and serious health problems
