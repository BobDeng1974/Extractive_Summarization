@entity1 ’s latest on - air gaffe - inadvertently blurting out the c - word - has come at the worst possible time for his career			1
the host of @entity7 ’s @entity6 coverage was in conversation with jockey @entity10 and former champion @entity11			1
they were chatting about @entity11 ’s early days in racing when @entity14 said : ‘ this is looking at it with rose - c * * * * * — rose - tinted glasses from the past ... i apologise there for a slip of the tongue , but @entity10 your love of the sport just shines through			1
’ @entity1 inadvertently said ' rose - c * * * * * glasses ' live on air during @entity7 's @entity6 coverage the blunder comes just over a fortnight before @entity29 are due to announce their @entity31 line - up			1
@entity14 was in pole position to be lead presenter after a sure - footed anchoring of the @entity35 helped restore his reputation following his crass remarks at @entity39 , when he said women ’s champion @entity42 was ‘ never going to be a looker ’			1
that incident caused secretary of state @entity45 to complain to @entity47 director - general @entity46 , who wrote back saying @entity14 had been told ‘ an incident of this nature must never happen again ’			0
the @entity47 apologised but @entity14 could pay the price when @entity29 name their @entity31 line - up @entity51 , managing director of @entity52 , must realise his job would be untenable if @entity54 , whom he appointed as coach , is axed after the @entity31 debacle			1
@entity51 naively rounded on a group of cricket reporters in @entity59 during his stay at the tournament to ask them to lay off the beleaguered @entity54 and get behind him instead			1
if any move galvanises journalists to do the opposite to what they ’re told , it ’s a crass move like that			2
@entity70 managing director @entity51 ( left ) asked reporters to get behind coach @entity54 ( right ) olympic gold medal cyclist @entity72 , who is taking a year to learn how to ride well enough to complete in next year ’s @entity73 , will be at @entity6 on wednesday to gain more knowledge of racing			1
@entity72 will be a guest of her sponsors @entity76 , who have pr company @entity79 and racing strategist @entity80 to plot her course			2
this looks like a fanciful promotional ploy but everyone involved insists it is a serious venture			0
the proof will be seeing @entity72 in the saddle next march			2
@entity72 will be at @entity6 on wednesday as she bids to learn more about racing the olympic gold medal cyclist aims to complete as a jockey in next year ’s @entity73 @entity91 pundit sir @entity90 was not only allowed to miss @entity52 ’s @entity31 loss to @entity93 in @entity94 so he could prepare for a golf pro-am at the @entity96 in @entity97			1
it has also emerged that he persuaded @entity91 and host broadcasters star to let him be based in @entity100 because he loves the outdoor life over there			0
@entity103 broadcasters @entity104 and @entity105 allowed sir @entity90 be based in @entity100 because he likes the outdoors there - even if it meant he missed @entity52 's humiliating exit have 4,335 for the road ! @entity110 , who specialise in causing mischief at @entity6 , were tame by their standards on tuesday , handing out a proposed 4,335 pints from a pop - up pub on the way to the course to recognise @entity118 ’s career winning rides			1
@entity118 ’s representatives complained about the stunt , which the bookmakers are not repeating			0
meanwhile , the name of @entity6 ’s new £ 40million grandstand is to be decided by racecourse management and @entity127 owners			2
but as the royal box is situated in the building , and given the make - up of the selection committee , a royal name is odds - on favourite			0
@entity135 , who have many racing enthusiasts in their squad , will be envious of @entity139 and @entity140 being @entity6 guests of @entity142 - the @entity135 ’ new kit sponsors			2
but @entity135 manager @entity144 has taken the players training in @entity146 this week , meaning they will miss the @entity148 and @entity150 ’s notable hospitality			0
@entity135 's @entity151 , @entity152 and @entity153 at @entity154 during a break from training the @entity158 ’s strong opposition to the @entity159 in @entity160 has n’t stopped them hosting their national team over here			0
the @entity160 will be training at @entity162 in may before a friendly against @entity164 to be played in the @entity165			0
this is despite @entity158 chairman @entity167 saying of the most controversial tournament in football history : ‘ the best option would be to not hold it in @entity160 , but we are now beyond that so november - december would seem to be the best of the bad options			0
’ the @entity158 say @entity160 using @entity176 is purely a commercial matter , aimed at making sure the facility is used as much as possible			0
@entity179 trains at @entity162 with the @entity52 squad , where the @entity158 will welcome the @entity160 national team in may despite outspoken opposition to the country hosting the @entity159			0

@entity1 said rose - c * * * * * when he meant rose - tinted glasses
@entity187 came during an *interview* for @entity7 ’s @entity6 coverage
it comes just as @entity29 prepare to announce their @entity31 line - up
@entity51 made crass *request* to reporters to support @entity54
future jumps jockey @entity72 at @entity6 on wednesday
@entity104 and @entity105 bow to sir @entity90 's @entity100 *request*s
