@entity1 ’s officials have attacked a @entity3 - backed campaign that claims his benefit changes are forcing people to go to food banks			1
in a striking billboard advert that says ‘ @entity8 is n’t eating ’ , the charity @entity9 uses the famous image from the @entity11 ’ 1979 election poster , ‘ @entity13 ’			1
the highly political charity poster features the same long line of people used to illustrate dole queues under @entity19 ’s ailing government , but this time places them outside a food bank			2
provocative : a @entity3 advertising campaign blames benefits changes for more people visiting food banks copycat : the @entity3 handout echoes the @entity11 election poster famously designed by @entity30 and @entity31 it reads : ‘ thousands are going hungry because of benefit changes			1
’ but a spokesman for mr @entity1 ’s @entity37 said there was ‘ no robust evidence ’ welfare reforms are linked to increased use of food banks			1
the charity , supported by the @entity3 and other churches , says on its website that half a million people used aid from food banks this year			2
@entity1 's department has said there is no evidence that welfare changes are behind increased use of food banks it claims ‘ the single most common reason for people to need food aid is that their benefits have been changed , delayed or stopped ’			1
the figures appear to come from the @entity60 , which runs 400 food banks in @entity8			1
its chairman , @entity62 , has been accused by mr @entity1 of ‘ scaremongering ’ and ‘ political messaging ’ by claiming the use of them is linked to welfare reforms			2
in a letter leaked yesterday the @entity70 rejected the idea , writing : ‘ i strongly refute this claim and would politely ask you to stop scaremongering in this way			0
‘ i understand that a feature of your business model must require you to continuously achieve publicity , but i ’m concerned that you are now seeking to do this by making your political opposition to welfare reform overtly clear			0
’ he told mr @entity62 that the @entity37 ’s record in processing welfare claims had improved under the @entity84 and would do further when @entity85 – the merging of six benefits into one payment – is up and running			0
the @entity37 says 92 per cent of benefits are processed on time , compared with 86 per cent in 2009 - 10 under the last government			0
@entity91 have repeatedly used increases in the number of food banks as evidence of a ‘ cost of living crisis ’			2
but a @entity37 spokesman said that if three new food banks are opening every week , as the @entity60 says , then ‘ it ’s not surprising more people are using them ’			2
he added : ‘ our welfare reforms will improve the lives of some of the poorest families in our communities with @entity85 making three million households better off – the majority of these from the bottom two fifths of the income scale			0
’ @entity112 claims that the single biggest reason given by people for visiting food banks is that their benefits have either been cut or stopped @entity11 mp @entity117 wrote on @entity118 last night : ‘ if some parts of the @entity3 preached a little more gospel and a little less politics – perhaps [ the ] @entity3 would be in a better place			1
’ for the launch of the @entity8 is n’t eating campaign , @entity112 said on its website : ‘ the explosion in food poverty and the use of food banks is a national disgrace			1
it undermines the @entity8 ’s commitment to ensuring all its citizens have access to food – one of the most basic human rights			0
’ a @entity3 spokesman said the charity was independent but shared some personnel , adding : ‘ there are more than 400 food banks up and down the country … many supported or run by local churches … supporting those in need is a core gospel value for @entity149			0
’ mr @entity62 denied that his organisation was politically motivated and said mr @entity1 has refused to meet him to discuss the issue			0
sir @entity152 , @entity11 mp for @entity153 , said a survey this year found 62 per cent of food bank users did so because of low income , 42 per cent because of benefit changes and 35 per cent as a result of benefit delays .			0
