sparks flew during a rare late - night hearing before the @entity2 , as visibly upset @entity3 raked @entity5 officials over the coals while the ink was still wet on a scathing inspector general report condemning the agency 's deadly failures			1
the report found that in @entity14 , @entity15 alone , 1,700 @entity13 military veterans were denied medical care and others waited an average of 115 days to be seen by a doctor – and that officials covered up the lapses by manipulating wait - lists and other official records			1
@entity24 @entity3 rep. @entity3 , a physician and veteran of the @entity26 , summed up the mood on @entity28 when he addressed dr. @entity29 , the @entity5 's assistant deputy undersecretary for health			1
they live in my communities , and they ca n't get in , and they 're desperate to get in , ' howled an incredulous @entity3			2
' and someone who 's making $ 180,000 a year gets a bonus for not taking care of the veterans ? i do n't get that			1
' rep. @entity53 , a @entity73 @entity3 who chairs the panel , wasted no time in going after va assistant secretary for congressional and legislative affairs @entity75			2
' until @entity5 understands that we ’re deadly serious , you can expect us to be over your shoulder every single day , ' he told her			1
and then ' deadly serious ' became , literally , deadly			0
' why have you not told this committee yet who was disciplined in @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity87 , @entity88 , where nine veterans died because they were on a waiting list for colonoscopies ? ' @entity53 asked			1
@entity75 deflected the question , saying that her office had ' responded to more than 100,000 requests for information , ' but @entity53 was unimpressed			0
' ma’am ! @entity97 ! @entity97 ! @entity98 ! ' he exclaimed			2
' veterans died ! get us the answers , please ! ' ' i understand that , mr. chairman , ' @entity75 replied , and i will look — ' ' that ’s what you said three months ago ! ' @entity53 boomed			1
' this has been going on since january			0
' ' in case you do n’t know it , we put on our website every week what we ask for , ' he said , ' and nothing changes from week to week			0
' @entity13 military veterans were on hand to hear testimony about unauthorized wait - lists in the @entity120 -- a ' systemic ' mismanagement problem that has brought calls for va secretary @entity123 to resign @entity124 : rep. @entity53 sparred with witnesses about everything from missing paperwork to their habit of looking to prepared notes for canned answers			1
a @entity5 inspector general 's report released wednesday showed that at least 1,700 veterans in @entity14 , @entity15 , were not registered on the proper waiting list to see doctors -- while the hospital falsely reported minimal waiting times to hide delays @entity53 aired a laundry list of complaints about the @entity5 's response to congressional demands , including the agency 's refusal to brief members of @entity148			1
' we did ask the [ @entity5 ] office of general counsel to come brief members last week , and the general counsel declined , ' the @entity73 said			1
' he said he declined because he did n’t want to brief the members – he wanted to brief the staff			0
' ' it takes repeated requests and threats of compulsion to get @entity5 to bring their people here , ' a disgusted @entity53 concluded			2
@entity75 got he worst of it			0
as she referred to prepared notes in order to answer questions , an outraged @entity53 lost patience			0
' can you say anything without reading your prepared notes ? ' he demanded ? the @entity5 has reportedly provided the committee with 5,500 pages of documents , but lawmakers are convinced there 's much more to be found			1
' let me be clear : i am not happy , ' said @entity177 rep. @entity176 , the committee 's ranking @entity178			0
' we 'll get to the bottom of this , uncover the truth , and ensure a solution is implemented to make sure something like this never happens again			0
' @entity5 assistant secretary for congressional and legislative affairs @entity75 ( r ) got the worst of wednesday night 's hearing , with @entity2 members slamming her for withholding documents @entity148 has subpoenaed flop sweat : @entity29 was visibly shaken as he answered questions about the @entity5 's crumbling accountability and the deaths of 40 veterans in @entity14 alone @entity3 was more pointed			1
' if you do n't give us the information , ' he said , ' i 'm thinking , " there 's something they 're trying to hide			2
" why would n't you just turn over the documents , and – they are what they are			0
' ' is there a reason ? ... in my mind , i 'm thinking right now that you 're hiding something from me			0
and i have no reason to believe you 're not , ' he said			0
the three @entity5 witnesses were not permitted to offer an opening statement			2
a @entity2 staff member told @entity220 that there was some internal debate about that decision			1
' i guess if they had something to tell us , they should have told us years ago			0
' questions arose about how and why documents related to the @entity14 cover - up were destroyed – especially off - the - books waiting lists that showed a realistic picture of how long veterans waited for their doctor visits			2
on wednesday at least 58 members of @entity148 , including 20 @entity238 , demanded va secretary @entity123 's resignation , with @entity15 @entity240 sen. @entity240 leading the charge and calling on president @entity242 to fire him if he did n't step down			1
@entity244 @entity243 rep. @entity243 added to the bloodletting in the evening , demanding the termination of all three witnesses : @entity29 , @entity75 , and @entity248 , a @entity5 congressional relations officer			2
' you are not being forthright in your testimony , ' @entity250 boomed			0
' you are here to serve yourselves and not the men and women who have made extraordinary sacrifices to serve this country			0

one @entity24 congressman told a @entity5 official : ' i do n't understand how you can stand at a mirror and look at yourself in the mirror , and shave in the morning , and not throw up '
the @entity2 chairman *barked* at one witness : ' @entity268 ! @entity97 ! @entity97 ! @entity97 ! veterans died ! get us the answers , please ! '
the rare nighttime hearing was called to *investigate* the mismanagement of @entity5 medical *facilities* , a system that the *aegncy* 's inspector general *eviscerated* on wednesday
his report found ' systemic ' problems at the *cabinet* - level agency , including an average wait time of 115 days for vets to see a doctor for the first time
