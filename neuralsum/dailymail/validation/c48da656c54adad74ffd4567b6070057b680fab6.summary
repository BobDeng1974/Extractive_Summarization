young teenagers are happier and healthier now than teenagers were a decade ago , a new study said yesterday			1
it found that the ‘ @entity10 generation ’ of youngsters are less likely than their predecessors to drink alcohol , smoke tobacco or cannabis , or get bullied			1
a growing proportion of 11 to 15 - year - olds , the study said , engage in behaviour that would make their parents proud			1
they eat fruit and vegetables , take exercise , clean their teeth , and talk to their mothers and fathers			1
adolescents are more likely to eat fruit and vegetables , take exercise , talk to their mothers and fathers however the study , assembled by academics at @entity31 , complained that despite the increasing levels of health and well - being , adolescents now are just as likely to be fat as the generation of the 2000s			1
obesity rates , it said , did not decline between 2002 and 2010			0
the findings , based on a series of papers put together with the help of the @entity43 , are the latest to underline the increasing trend for teenagers to avoid risky behaviour in favour of a healthier lifestyle			2
in @entity50 and @entity51 teen pregnancies have fallen to levels last seen in the 1960s and official surveys have shown a major drop in drinking among young people			1
more than a quarter of under - 24s are teetotal and fewer than a fifth ever go binge drinking , according to 2013 estimates			2
in 2013 tobacco smoking among young women aged 18 to 24 dropped by 10 per cent , and among young men by almost as much			0
state surveys also showed a major drop in 2013 in numbers of people in the same age group who took any illegal drug , down from 19.3 per cent to 16.3 per cent			0
some researchers have pointed to a ‘ @entity10 effect ’ which has led teenagers who would once have spent their spare time on the streets instead to devote it to playing with gadgets in their bedrooms			2
widespread public disapproval of smoking , drunkenness , drug abuse and teen mothers is also likely to have influenced teen behaviour			2
professor @entity85 of @entity86 , who assembled evidence drawn up from surveys and official statistics carried out in @entity90 and @entity91 , said : ‘ there is much to celebrate about the health and well - being of many young people today			0
’ the study , assembled by academics at @entity31 ( pictured ) , said that despite the increasing levels of health and well - being , adolescents now are just as likely to be fat as the previous generation she added however that ‘ others continue to experience real and worrying problems			1
’ some countries , including @entity106 , showed evidence that fewer youngsters took daily exercise in 2010 than in 2002			0
the report said that while the overall optimistic picture seems surprising , considering that many countries faced a severe economic crisis in the last decade , policies and actions to improve public health were implemented in many countries in the same period			0
many of those policies were , however , deeply controversial			0
some researchers have pointed to a ‘ @entity10 effect ’ which has led teenagers who would once have spent their spare time on the streets instead to devote it to playing with gadgets critics of the @entity127 , launched in @entity50 by @entity128 , have said that it had nothing to do with the fall in teenage pregnancy , which did not become evident until after @entity134 ’s @entity133 scrapped the programme of contraceptive distribution in 2010			1
yesterday ’s report added that ‘ the general feeling that young people are better off today could also be attributed to changes in fashions , behavioural norms and societal values			0
’ professor @entity85 said : ‘ adolescence is a crucial stage in life when you lay the foundation for adulthood , whether that is healthy or otherwise			0

11 - 15 year olds less *vulnerable* to drugs , alcohol and smoking *cigarettes*
the generation is more likely to eat healthily , exercise and respect *elders*
however @entity31 *'s* study shows adolescents just as likely to be obese
teen pregnancies in @entity50 and @entity51 have fallen to 1960s levels
