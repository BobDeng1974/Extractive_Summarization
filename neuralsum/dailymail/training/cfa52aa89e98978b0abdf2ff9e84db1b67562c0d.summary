long - awaited : @entity1 veterans who arrived to ' clean up ' after the war were finally given campaign medals lining up : the prime minister made the presentations in 10 @entity7 , including to @entity19 ( right ) long gap : warrant officer @entity21 is presented with his @entity6 today by the prime minister although the war was over , their work was not without its dangers			1
they had to deal with landmines and the graves of the war dead , and one soldier , @entity33 lance - corporal @entity32 , died when his spade hit a grenade two weeks after the surrender			1
for decades the only veterans who could claim the @entity6 were those who had been on the islands up to july 12 , 1982			1
but this year a long - awaited independent review ruled that time should be extended by three months to october 21 , 1982			1
it now covers veterans who served up to when an airfield at what is now @entity44 , opened in 1985 , was completed as part of @entity47 's efforts to strengthen the islands against future attacks			1

pictured : @entity67 meets the pm gap : colleagues of @entity71 ( pictured ) earned their medals when @entity73 was in @entity74 the review by the former @entity47 ambassador to @entity58 , sir @entity57 , was controversial with many other servicemen - because it left out veterans of conflicts including @entity80 , @entity81 and @entity82			2
it declared new medals would be awarded to those who served in @entity86 and the @entity87 - when the @entity88 flew supplies to people in @entity91 in 1948 and 1949			0
other conflicts were not mentioned in the review , whose aim was ' to draw a definitive line under issues which in some cases had been controversial for many years '			2
@entity1 veterans welcomed today 's ceremony			2
@entity101 , @entity102 and @entity104 co-ordinator for the @entity105 , told @entity106 : ' it 's been a long time coming			0

one veteran said : ' the jobs these guys had to do were horrendous ' campaign : @entity115 with the prime minister			1
the veterans were of varying ages and experience @entity120 receiving his campaign medal			0
some servicemen missed out on the honour by just a day dirty work : @entity125 ( pictured ) was one of those who had to clear areas of mines after the surrender return : @entity130			2
the review was designed to ' draw a line ' under all historic claims on campaign medals ' there was still danger in the form of minefields which are still there to this day			2
a @entity33 was killed after the conflict ended doing trench clearance			1
' the 56 - year - old added : ' some of the jobs those guys had to do afterwards were horrendous			2

a lot of ships still went down			0
' my mate was one of those who missed out			0
he did n't get the medal because he got there one day too late			0
at the time they certainly felt like they were n't being recognised '			0
criteria : the medal is now given to soldiers who served until an airfield at @entity44 ( above ) was built hidden danger : there are still minefields in the islands feared never to have been cleared , veterans said			1

former soldiers had arrived on the islands after the conflict ended
they still had to *negotiate* land mines and graves of the war dead
review this year ruled they should be *eligible* for @entity6
awards were presented in 10 @entity7 today by prime minister
