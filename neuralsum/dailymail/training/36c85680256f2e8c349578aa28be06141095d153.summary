by @entity0 @entity1 has launched an astonishing attack on his employer the @entity3 , saying it is ‘ smug ’ and he hates much of its output			1
in typically scathing style , the @entity8 presenter said the severance payoff scandal at the corporation – in which senior executives were handed £ 60million in ‘ golden goodbyes ’ – had produced a ‘ great smell ’			1
and he added that the @entity3 ’s commercial rivals are right to complain that it ‘ distorts the marketplace ’ with its vast , publicly funded news operation			1
@entity1 claimed the @entity3 ' distorts the marketplace ' due to the size of its publicly funded news operation @entity1 said : ‘ [ the @entity3 ] is smug			1
i love the @entity3 in many ways , but at the same time it has made me loathe aspects of it , and that ’s a very odd state of affairs			2
‘ when i see people being given £ 1million merely for walking out of the door , when i see £ 100million being blown on that @entity25 [ digital media initiative ] thing , a stupid technical initiative like that , i start wondering : how much longer are we going to test the public ’s patience ? ’ in recent months , several of @entity1 ’s colleagues – including @entity35 and @entity36 – have openly criticised the @entity3 ’s management			1
but until now the 63 - year - old has been relatively restrained			0
the @entity8 presenter condemned the high level of pay - offs received by some senior @entity3 executives asking ' how much longer are we going to test the public 's patience ? ' @entity3 director general standing outside @entity45 which @entity1 describes as ' a ghastly building ' he hit out at the size of the @entity3 , saying much of its content , such as its popular music stations , could be produced equally well by commercial broadcasters			1
he told the @entity52 newspaper : ‘ there ’s a pile of stuff on the @entity3 i ca n’t stand			2
my idea of hell is going down in one of the lifts in that ghastly new building [ @entity45 ] in a lift which has @entity62 plumbed into it			2
i do n’t quite understand why the @entity3 does @entity64			1
i do n’t really understand why it does @entity64			2
‘ clearly , you can meet those needs commercially			0
the @entity3 has got an unfortunate history of never seeing an area of broadcasting – or , increasingly , a web presence – without feeling the need to get into it itself			2
’ @entity1 said the @entity3 was ' smug ' and he hated much of its output @entity1 questioned the continuing existence of channels such as @entity75 featuring dj @entity76 ( right ) pictured alongside pop stars @entity78 ( left ) and @entity79 ( centre ) @entity1 claimed ' the @entity3 has got an unfortunate history of never seeing an area of broadcasting - or , increasingly a web presence - without feeling need to get into it itself ' and he accused the @entity3 of using the licence fee to undermine its commercial rivals			1
there is growing anger over how the corporation is able to challenge the country ’s @entity91 through its publicly funded news websites			0
home secretary @entity94 said last year that the @entity3 was ‘ destroying local newspapers ’			0
@entity1 said his idea of hell was ' going down in one of the lifts in that hastly new building [ @entity45 ] in a lift which has @entity62 plumbed into it ' @entity1 said it was understandable that rival news organisations such as the @entity104 dislike the fact the @entity3 is able to compete on ‘ unfair terms ’			1
he added : ‘ there ’s no argument that the @entity3 distorts the marketplace in online [ news ]			0
and i do n’t think that has been really sufficiently grasped at a senior level			0
‘ it just happened , in the same way as has the proliferation of extra television channels , the proliferation of extra radio channels – and , going further back , the move into local radio			0
‘ these things just happened because the @entity3 is institutionally unable to countenance something without wanting to have it for itself			0
’ @entity1 was equally cutting about the recent payoff scandal			0
he said : ‘ i do n’t tar [ director general ] @entity126 with this because he has n’t been there long enough , but the great smell that comes off those payoff scandals – and i think they are scandals – is of an organisation which became complacent , preoccupied with the conditions of its senior staff , at the expense of a strategic vision			1
’ earlier this year , @entity137 presenter @entity35 said the @entity3 was ‘ grotesquely over managed ’ and has a ‘ broadly liberal ’ bias			0
@entity36 said the @entity3 was ‘ too big for its own good ’			0
last year , @entity3 director of television @entity140 warned its stars to stop attacking the corporation in public			1
he said : ‘ i ’m finding a little too often that people who work for the @entity3 and are well rewarded for it are quick to attack or criticise the organisation			0

@entity1 criticised huge rewards for senior staff when they leave the @entity3
said that @entity64 and @entity151 had no reason to exist and could be *replaced* by private - sector broadcasters
@entity155 *suggested* that the bungled £ 100million @entity25 had caused the public to lose faith
@entity159 is a ' ghastly building '
