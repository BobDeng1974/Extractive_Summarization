a new drug being tested to treat cancer could help people affected by a common form of autism , scientists believe			1
researchers have identified a chemical pathway that goes awry in the brains of ' @entity10 ' patients			1
they say the cancer drug could block the pathway and reverse their behavioural symptoms			1
@entity10 is the most common genetic cause of autism spectrum disorders			1
the drug blocks a rogue pathway in the brain that causes behavioural symptoms ( file photo ) it affects around one in 4,000 boys and one in 6,000 girls			1
currently , there is no cure			0
the team at @entity34 and @entity35 in @entity36 identified a key molecule - @entity37 - that triggers excess protein production in the brains of @entity10 patients			1
this can cause behavioural symptoms that include learning difficulties			2
it can also lead to more serious intellectual disabilities , delays in speech and language development and problems with social interactions			0
they found that @entity37 regulates the production of a specific enzyme , which breaks down and re-orders the connections between brain cells called synapses			0
this disrupts communication between brain cells , leading to changes in behaviour			0
the scientists have found that a naturally occurring chemical - called cercosporamide - improved sociability in mice with the condition			2
treatment with cercosporamide blocks the activity of @entity37 , and therefore reduces the amounts of the enzyme , and reverses the behavioural symptoms in mice with a version of @entity10			1
@entity77 is being tested as a treatment for lung cancer and acute myeloid leukemia			1
the new findings suggest that it could also have a use as a treatment for patients with @entity10			2
' our findings open the door to targeted treatments for @entity10 , ' said dr @entity90 , of @entity34 , who carried out the research ( file photo ) dr @entity90 , of @entity34 , said : ' our findings open the door to targeted treatments for @entity10			0
' by designing treatments that block just this pathway , it is hoped that we can limit the potential side - effects and develop therapies that are more efficient than general treatment approaches			2
' professor @entity98 , of @entity35 , added : ' we found that @entity37 regulates the production of an enzyme called @entity101 , which breaks down and re-orders the connections between brain cells called synapses			0
' @entity106 disrupts communication between brain cells , leading to changes in behaviour			0
' the study was published in the journal @entity113 .			0

team identified a chemical pathway that goes awry in ' @entity10 ' patients
@entity10 is the most common genetic cause of autism spectrum disorders
potential cancer drug called cercosporamide could block the pathway
found to reverse the behavioural symptoms associated with @entity10
@entity77 is being tested to treat lung cancer and leukemia
