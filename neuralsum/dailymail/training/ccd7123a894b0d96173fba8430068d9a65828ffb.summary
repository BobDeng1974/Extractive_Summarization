by @entity0 published : 12:51 est , 1 may 2013 updated : 17:16 est , 1 may 2013 convinced : detective @entity1 believes @entity2 is guilty of murder the detective who first led the @entity2 murder case has said he is convinced the @entity7 gold medalist is guilty			1
detective @entity1 was heavily criticised for his bungling of the investigation into the murder of @entity2 ' girlfriend @entity11 who was shot dead in the blade runner 's house			1
@entity1 was then forced to step down when it emerged he faced his own charges of attempted murder for a 2011 case in which he and two other officers fired on a vehicle in an attempt to make it stop			1
speaking to @entity22 , @entity1 , who knew @entity2 from a previous arrest on assault charges , said : ' the only place there could have been entrance was the open bathroom window and we did everything we could to see if anyone went through it , and it was impossible			1
' so i thought it was an open - and - closed case			1
he shot her - that 's it			2
' @entity2 , 26 , is charged with the murder of his girlfriend @entity41 , who was shot after she locked herself in his bathroom in the early hours of @entity43			1
he claims he mistook her for an intruder			0
the prosecution says it was a premeditated murder , but his defence advocate has argued there is no evidence to suggest the athlete 's account of events is untrue			2
in a dramatic twist , it then emerged that detective @entity1 had been charged with seven counts of attempted murder			1
the case was previously dropped but he was charged again and lieutenant general @entity60 replaced @entity1 as lead investigator			1
couple : @entity11 and @entity2 together at an awards ceremony before she was shot dead according to @entity11 's friends , they apparently noticed warning signs leading up to the death			0
@entity68 , who tattooed the word ' lioness ' on her ankle , said @entity2 ' name was not good on the street			0
in the dock : @entity2 is charged with the murder of his girlfriend @entity41 who was shot dead on @entity43 while @entity11 's cousin @entity78 described him as a nice guy , but on one occasion , when @entity2 had left the table , she asked @entity11 if she was happy to which she gave a hesitant response			2
however , close friends of @entity2 are still shocked by the event			0
@entity86 , who @entity2 calls @entity87 , said every time the athlete mentions @entity41 he says he is a broken man			0
earlier this month it was revealed that @entity2 will be allowed to compete in @entity90 this summer after a judge relaxed his bail terms to allow him to make money			0
layers successfully argued that he should be allowed to travel abroad to ' earn income ' while awaiting trial			0
the controversial decision clears the way for him to take part in @entity101 's showpiece athletics event at the @entity102			0
although charged with murder , @entity2 has not been convicted of any crime and would be allowed to enter @entity90 by the @entity105			2
it is now likely that he will compete at the @entity107 , which takes place from july 26 to 28 at the @entity102 in @entity101 - one year on from @entity109			2
