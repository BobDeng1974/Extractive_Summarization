glamorous in a tailored grey suit and beige silk shirt , @entity2 's @entity1 @entity0 was every inch the professional as she toured a tourism fair - even when confronted by a man in fancy dress			1
the @entity2 royal , 42 , was visiting the @entity10 in @entity11 when a well - wisher in a grey robe approached , brandishing a map			1
ever composed , @entity0 and husband @entity14 , who celebrates his 47th birthday on friday , smiled broadly at the man before inspecting the map and moving on			1
despite the serious subject matter , the royal appeared to enjoy the event and smiled happily at waiting photographers as she left			0
the meeting with @entity26 was a bit of a departure for @entity0 who , until now , has focused her efforts on championing @entity2 culture and the plight of disabled people , although latterly , health has become something of a preoccupation			2
last week , she compered a meeting of the @entity45 , an organisation of which she is president			0
all smiles : @entity0 appeared to be on top form as she toured the tourism event and met well - wishers @entity50 : the @entity2 queen was glamorous in a sharply tailored suit and neat beige silk shirt come to @entity2 : @entity14 made a speech at the event , which hopes to showcase the many beauties of @entity2 a day later and she was back on the cultural beat , joining husband @entity14 for the opening of a museum in @entity61			1
during the couple 's tour of @entity65 , they were shown a contemporary art exhibition which included pieces by a number of @entity2 greats , among them @entity71			1
@entity0 's latest meeting comes shortly after the @entity2 royal family was left reeling by news that a woman claiming to be the love child of former king @entity77 has come forward			2
@entity78 , 47 , has been given the green light to take her battle for recognition by the royals forward to the @entity83 - if she can prove her story is true			0
listening in : @entity0 stood proudly at the edge of the stage as @entity14 made his speech busy : the @entity2 royals have had a busy week so far with plenty of engagements scheduled in low key : @entity2 's @entity1 @entity0 arrives on foot for the board meeting of @entity26 in @entity11 yesterday morning no car : she was without a car or flunkies and was accompanied by a single bodyguard according to ms @entity78 , she is the product of a three - night liaison between her mother @entity100 , a @entity101 governess , and the now 76 - year - old royal in 1966			1
although by then a married 28 - year - old father of two , an affair would hardly have been out of character for @entity77			0
throughout his marriage ' @entity106 ' is said to have bedded some 1,500 women , including an alleged affair with princess @entity110 while on a cruise with their spouses in august 1986			0
ms @entity78 herself had no idea of the identity of her father for more than 40 years , only being told his name in 2011			0
although @entity2 courts rejected her paternity claims twice on the grounds that a monarch could not be subjected to such tests , @entity106 - @entity77 ' abdication last year has paved the way for a new attempt			2
concerned : @entity0 has been championing an increasing number of health related causes in recent weeks looking cool : @entity0 donned a pair of stylish aviator sunglasses as she made her exit			0

@entity141 both looked *businesslike* in suits and sensible shoes
