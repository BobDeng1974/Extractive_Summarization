one in eight retired @entity6 still have a mortgage to pay off , with an average loan burden of nearly £ 50,000 , a report revealed yesterday			1
it estimates around 1.6million over the age of 55 who have retired have a mortgage			1
some owe more than £ 100,000 , the study said			1
the research into the over- 55s who have stopped full - time work shatters the dream of retirement being a time of holidays , relaxation and time with grandchildren			0
in fact , the report , from the pension experts @entity26 , estimates retired @entity6 have a total debt burden of more than £ 100billion			1
it warned the rising tide of poor pensioners is ‘ alarming ’ , and said many are too scared to talk about their debts which are a ‘ taboo ’ subject for many people of this generation			0
many have interest - only mortgages , a loan which allowed them to pay the interest but none of the actual loan , forcing many to sell their home when the loan matures			2
@entity6 ’s new regulator , the @entity44 , estimates 40,000 people a year over 65 will have this type of loan maturing between 2017 and 2032			1
the lucky ones will be able to repay the mortgage lump sum that they borrowed decades ago			0
many of the unlucky ones will be forced to extend their mortgage and keep on paying a mortgage into their 70s , which means they may have to keep on working to find the money			0
fearful : many unlucky pensioners will be forced to extend their mortgage into their 70s @entity60 , pensions technical director of @entity26 , said : ‘ these figures are alarming			0
‘ they show the pressure people face on a daily basis trying to balance the household budget			0
‘ although many people consider themselves retired , they are continuing to pay off their mortgage , some with quite substantial balances			2
‘ dig a little deeper and many people are working part - time , sometimes through choice but often simply to make ends meet			0
‘ talking about debt in retirement will be a taboo for many people who find themselves in this position			2
’ yesterday the @entity78 , which looked at older people who are 65 and over , said it estimates around 325,000 in this age group are repaying a loan , typically of £ 30,000			1
more than one in ten described their monthly mortgage repayments as ‘ a heavy burden			2
’ to add to the pressure on pensioners , a separate report reveals how the income that they get from their savings and investments has collapsed since the financial crisis began			0
property difficulties : more than one in ten described their monthly mortgage repayments as ¿ a heavy burden ¿ the average retired household received around £ 1,863 a year in 2007/08 , compared to £ 1,207 today , according to the retirement income firm @entity98			1
@entity26 warned around a third of ‘ retirees ’ also have other personal debts , with an average of around £ 7,000			2
it comes after one of @entity6 ’s biggest debt charity warned last week of a ‘ crisis ’ among people over the age of 60 with record numbers facing insolvency			1
@entity110 said it dealt with a record number of people in this age group last year , and said the numbers had shot up nearly 40 per cent since the recession began			0
the report reveals people aged 60 and over typically have larger debts than any other age group who contact the debt charity about their financial problems			1
on average , their total debts are £ 23,000 , while the average debts of a typical person contacting the debt charity are around £ 17,650 .			1

retired @entity6 have a total debt burden of more than £ 100billion
325,000 of *65s* and over are repaying a loan , typically of £ 30,000
