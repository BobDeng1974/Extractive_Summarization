@entity0 knows that @entity1 has the style to beat @entity3 in the @entity4			1
the hitman also considers that having @entity6 in his corner gives the @entity1 a massive advantage over the @entity9 , who is trained by his father , @entity10			1
still , when it comes to the half - billion - dollar crunch on may 2 in @entity13 , @entity0 expects @entity3 will ' find a way to win			1
' @entity1 works up a sweat shadow boxing during preparations for his clash with @entity3 with his eyes closed and grimacing with effort , @entity1 ramps up his shadow boxing routine yet he warns @entity22 that if does beat @entity1 and wants to go on to eclipse @entity24 's historic record of retiring as undefeated world champion after 49 straight wins , then he should ' stay away from our own @entity27			1
' @entity0 , who talks from the painful inside knowledge of having been knocked out by the men currently considered to be the two best pound - for - pound fighters in the world , says : ' we all know @entity3 has this brilliant defence but one of his greatest strengths is his ability to adapt in the ring			1
it is that boxing brain which is @entity1 's big problem			1
' @entity1 has the style to beat @entity10			2
the quick hands and feet			0
he 's a fast southpaw , which is what gives @entity3 trouble			1
' @entity6 wo n't tell him to go charging at him down the pipe			2
he 'll want him to throw a lot more punches than @entity10 , who picks his shots			0
but he 'll tell him to do it by nipping in and out so he does n't get caught by @entity10 's counters			0
' @entity0 , pictured at his gym earlier this year , says @entity1 has the style to beat @entity3 it was a vicious left hand from @entity1 that left @entity0 on the canvas in @entity13 in 2009 @entity1 takes on @entity3 six years to the day after knocking @entity0 out at the same venue @entity0 also says having trainer @entity6 ( right ) in his corner gives @entity1 a huge advantage @entity60 trained @entity0 for his fight with @entity1 and the @entity62 says : ' i do n't want to knock him but i was shocked that he could n't do southpaw pads			1
that 's a big disadvantage for @entity10			0
' and in @entity6 , @entity1 has one of the greatest trainers in the world			1
he 'll make a huge difference			0
' but i still go back to my initial feeling that @entity10 will work out how to beat him , somehow			0
win or lose he will still go down as one of the best of all time			2
if he wins i 'm sure he will want to go on to beat @entity24 's record			0
he 'll be on 48 - 0 and he 'll probably be due any easy fight to get him level with @entity24			0
' and that means staying well clear of @entity27			2
@entity3 has also been posting pictures and video of his preparation for the may 2 showdown @entity3 works on the bag as he prepares for the @entity4 in @entity13 @entity0 lost to @entity3 in 2007 at the @entity82 when the fight was stopped in the 10th round @entity85 boxer @entity27 could cause @entity3 problems , according to @entity0 ' @entity10 will run a mile from @entity27 , ' says @entity0			1
' @entity27 could cause him even more problems than @entity1			1
' everyone laughs at me when i say this and i wonder if i know as much about boxing as i think			0
but @entity27 's been boxing much better lately , with a lot more discipline			2
' and with @entity3 dipping slightly at 38 – probably not at the peak he was when he fought @entity95 and me – @entity27 could be the one who 's even faster than @entity10			1
but @entity3 will not even think about fighting him unless he runs out of opponents before he gets to that record			2
' @entity27 's right to keep @entity99 on hold while he waits to see if he can get the winner on may 2			1
@entity99 would do the same			0
but he could have to wait even longer unless @entity102 is a big anti-climax , which it could be if they 're both cagey because they have so much respect for each other			0
' @entity10 likes to fight on the back foot so it will be up to @entity1 to make it a great fight by going for him			2
and if that happens then with all the money they can make i 'm certain they 'll look at the re-match			0
' * @entity102 will be exclusively live on @entity119 , late saturday , may 2			0
