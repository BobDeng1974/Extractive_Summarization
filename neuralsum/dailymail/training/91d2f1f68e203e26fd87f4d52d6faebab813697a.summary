@entity0 , 90 , died from a stroke after a four - man gang ransacked her home in @entity4 - but noone was tried for her death serious questions have been raised over why a gipsy gang which ransacked the country home of a retired headmistresses minutes before she died from a stroke have not been prosecuted over her death			1
@entity0 , 90 , had frantically phoned 999 after four burglars dressed in blue boiler suits turned up at her £ 550,000 detached home in @entity17 , @entity4 , claiming to be water board officials			1
an inquest into miss @entity0 's death heard how one of the men pretended to inspect her taps , as three others turned over her property , before fleeing with a haul of valuables			1
but by the time officers arrived after the incident in august 2012 , the elderly woman had collapsed and was rushed to hospital , where she died 24 hours later			2
police launched a murder inquiry and a string of specialists said the stroke was extremely likely to have been caused by the stress of the raid			1
but , one year later , manslaughter charges against the four men were dropped by the @entity41 , due to an alleged lack of medical evidence			1
instead , the gang - who lived on caravan sites in @entity47 and @entity48 - were jailed for burglary			2
@entity51 senior coroner @entity50 has now questioned why the @entity41 dropped the charges relating to the ' absolute tragedy ' of miss @entity0 's death			1
speaking at @entity54 on tuesday at the inquest , mr @entity50 said he believed the actions of the gang had caused miss @entity0 's fatal stroke ' on the balance of probability '			1
recording a narrative conclusion , he added : ' it 's been suggested that cerebral haemorrhage may be triggered by acute stress response			2
' however the scientific evidence can not exclude the possibility that this was coincidental			0
on the balance of probability i would suggest it has been a contributing factor			0
' i do share the disappointment with the officers about the charges that were n't pursued			2
' mrs @entity0 's second cousin @entity72 also said he was ' disgusted ' that the criminals had not been further pursued			1
detective chief inspector @entity74 , from @entity75 , had told the hearing how the @entity41 did not believe it could be proven beyond doubt the men were responsible for the death			2
the culprits were @entity81 , 20 , @entity82 , 22 , @entity83 , 20 , and @entity84 , 23			0
she said : ' i believe we reached that threshold but we have to leave the decision to the @entity41			0
it was their view and the view of counsel that the standard was n't met			0
' we were unable to get the authority to charge with manslaughter			2
the gang posed as water board officials before carrying out the burglary			1
miss @entity0 ( pictured left and right in a 1974 school photo ) graduated from @entity100 and taught at @entity101 for girls although @entity103 ( left ) lived alone , she bought and shared the £ 550,000 property with her friend and former @entity107 deputy head @entity105 ( right ) until miss @entity105 ’s death in 2006 ' that was because , in the view of the @entity41 , our medical evidence was n't strong enough for a causal link to be established			2
' but a range of different specialists , including the pathologist who carried out miss @entity0 's post-mortem examination , concluded the stroke was extremely likely to have been brought on as a result of increased stress levels and blood pressure , in turn caused by the raid			1
after the hearing , the victim 's 57 - year - old cousin @entity123 said he was ' disgusted ' at the decision not to charge the men			1
the warehouse worker , from @entity129 , @entity130 , said : ' the sentences were miniscule			0
they could be doing it again			0

detective chief inspector @entity154 said there was breakthrough in the case when officers linked up 12 separate incidents through the presence of a distinctive @entity161			0
she added : ' all four suspects i have mentioned today were found guilty or pleaded to the offences conspiracy to burgle and rob			0
