people who carry a lot of fat around their middles are three and a half times more likely to develop memory loss and dementia in old age , research shows			2
scientists have found that people with a lot of abdominal fat have lower levels of the protein that also controls how the liver metabolises fat			1
called @entity17 , it controls fat metabolism in the liver , but it also resides in the brain ’s memory centre – the hippocampus – and controls memory and learning			1
people who carry a lot of fat around their middles are three and a half times more likely to develop memory loss and dementia in old age when people are overweight , they initially just have depleted @entity17 levels in their livers but eventually in their whole bodies , including their brains			1
neurological scientists at the @entity34 , in @entity35 , in collaboration with the @entity37 , believe their finding could lead to the development of an injection to improve learning and memory in people with dementia			2
dr @entity44 from @entity34 said : ‘ we need to better understand how fat is connected to memory and learning so that we can develop effective approach to protect memory and learning			0
‘ while @entity17 deficient mice are poor in learning and memory , injection of @entity17 to the hippocampus improves learning and memory			0
’ dr @entity44 said : ‘ further research must be conducted to see how we could potentially maintain normal @entity17 in the brain in order to be resistant to memory loss			0
’ researchers found people with a lot of abdominal fat have lower levels of the nuclear regulator @entity17 in their livers and brains making them 3.6 times more likely to develop dementia the research was published in the journal @entity68			1
previous research has suggested that passive smoking , sleep apnoea , drinking and taking drugs , type 2 diabetes and heart disease can all also increase a person 's risk of dementia			0
dementia currently affects about 800,000 people in the @entity79 .			0

people with lots of abdominal fat have lower levels of a protein called @entity17 in their brains and livers *-* increasing the risk of memory loss
this is because the protein controls memory and learning
the finding could lead to the development of injections to treat dementia
