when @entity1 spilt lemonade on his laptop , he decided it was not worth keeping			1
but he is now ruing his decision – after he realised it had £ 5million worth of virtual currency stored on the hard drive			1
the stash that could make him a millionaire is now buried under four feet of rubbish and mud in a landfill site			0
@entity1 , an it worker from @entity15 , pictured , had used his laptop to ' mine ' 7,500 units of digital @entity19 currency in 2009			1
at the time the coins - which are units of data stored in ' wallets ' on a computer - were practically worthless			1
but as more and more people heard about the new currency , its value has soared the 28 - year - old it worker had accumulated 7,500 units of ‘ bitcoin ’ soon after it was launched in 2009			1
back then his stash of ‘ coins ’ – which are units of data stored on his computer – was worth around £ 20 but their value has soared after the currency took off among online traders			1
the price of a single bitcoin reached £ 664 yesterday , meaning mr @entity1 ’ haul is worth an incredible £ 5million			1
windfall : @entity19 could be generated for next to nothing when they were first introduced in 2009 , but are now worth more than £ 600 each buried treasure : mr @entity1 ' valuable hard drive is estimated to be under four feet of rubbish kept on a landfill site ( file picture ) last week , it dawned on him how valuable his collection had become and he went looking for the hard drive			1
but when he got to the landfill site in @entity55 , @entity15 , workers broke the bad news that it could be anywhere beneath an area of rubbish the size of a football pitch			1
launched in 2009 , @entity19 can be exchanged for goods online and used as virtual tokens rather than physical coins or notes			1
as with any currency , their value is determined by how much people are willing to exchange them for			0
in 2011 , one bitcoin was worth £ 1.50 while today it is worth £ 664			1
customers can buy bitcoins from online exchanges			0
they are growing more popular among the public and investors but have yet to be accepted by websites of major retailers such as @entity79			0
bitcoins are stored in a ‘ wallet ’ on the hard drive of a computer and can be accessed using a ‘ private key ’			2
because they can be bought anonymously , critics say they are used for all sorts of criminal acts such as money laundering			0
he told the @entity90 : ‘ you know when you put something in the bin , and in your head , say to yourself “ that ’s a bad idea ” ? i really did have that			0
’ @entity19 – which were introduced by a mysterious programmer known as @entity100 – exist only as units of digital data and are not backed by a central bank			2
they can be bought , sold and even ‘ mined ’ , which means they are created by enthusiasts who use powerful computers to solve complex mathematical problems			0
mr @entity1 generated his stash in early 2009 , when the currency was known only in tech circles , by running a programme on his laptop for a week			1
but he stopped when his girlfriend complained the laptop was getting too noisy			0
in 2010 , the @entity118 @entity117 broke after he spilt lemonade on it , so he dismantled the computer for parts , kept the drive in a desk drawer and later binned it			2
his hoard can only be accessed using a ‘ private key ’ , or digital code			0
the problem is , the only copy is on his buried hard drive			2
mr @entity1 said he does not mind if hopefuls try digging for the device			2
‘ if they were to offer me a share , fair enough			0
there ’s a pot of gold there for someone it ’s my mistake throwing the hard drive out , at the end of the day			2
’ but even if somebody does find it , they wo n’t be able to get their hands on the cash without his help because the code is encrypted			0
a @entity152 spokesman said any treasure hunters turning up at the tip would be turned away			0
she added : ‘ obviously , if it was easily retrieved , we ’d return it			0

@entity1 , from @entity15 , ' generated ' the @entity19 in 2009 on his laptop
at the time the 7,500 coins he made were almost completely worthless
he later took the hard - drive out of the laptop and kept it in a drawer
but he threw it out in 2012 and only remembered the @entity19 last week
each one is now worth £ *613* - or £ *4,597,000* in total
