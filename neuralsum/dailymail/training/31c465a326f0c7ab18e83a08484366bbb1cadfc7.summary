the @entity1 is ‘ not working for @entity0 ’ , @entity2 warned last night			1
the chancellor said the @entity1 was ‘ causing problems for us ’ – and warned the continent was ‘ pricing itself out of the world economy ’			1
the stark assessment came as the @entity10 confirmed the @entity0 would be charged interest payments if it refuses to pay a disputed £ 1.7billion surcharge levied last month			1
the @entity22 chancellor is said to have warned mr @entity20 that she would rather see @entity0 leave the @entity1 than allow him to tear up free movement			1
but a leading think - tank has suggested limiting all benefits for @entity1 migrants for the first three years to reduce the so - called ‘ pull factors ’			2
senior @entity28 mps warned the prime minister he could not afford to back down over the issue – and mr @entity2 suggested there was no longer a place for @entity0 in an unreformed @entity1			1
he told the @entity35 ’s @entity34 programme : ‘ @entity0 joined [ the @entity1 ] for economic reasons , and when it ’s not working economically for @entity0 that ’s why we get this debate about the membership of the @entity1 and the nature of that membership			1
‘ i ’m someone who wants to stay in the @entity1 , i think that ’s right for @entity0 , but it has to be a reformed @entity1			2
’ he said that the @entity1 was ‘ morphing more and more into a eurozone focused on the survival of its currency ’			2
he added : ‘ it ’s perfectly all right for the @entity0 to say as the big country that ’s not in the euro , this relationship is not working properly for us			0
’ meanwhile , a think - tank has urged mr @entity20 to restrict access to the @entity56 for migrants from the @entity1 until they have lived here for three years			0
for that period they should lose access to almost all benefits , including tax credits , housing benefit and free use of the @entity56 , according to a report by the think - tank @entity65 , which enjoys close links to @entity68			0
@entity22 chancellor @entity17 shares a joke with @entity71 premier @entity70 as she insists that changing the right of workers to move freely throughout @entity74 is not on the table the @entity76 revealed last month that the @entity77 is already looking at ways to curb access to tax credits , which are seen as a major incentive for people to travel to @entity0 to work			1
currently , @entity0 is spending £ 5billion every year on tax credits for migrant workers from both inside and outside the @entity1			1
former @entity28 leadership contender @entity84 said mr @entity20 should face down mrs @entity17 and demand the right to limit immigration from the @entity1			0
he said proposals to curb access to benefits would not be enough to satisfy public concerns			0
prominent @entity91 @entity90 backed the call to stand firm , saying : ‘ in my view we actually have to take back control over our borders ’			0
mr @entity90 said mrs @entity17 ’s stance was just a ‘ negotiating position ’ and urged mr @entity20 to call her bluff			0
last night there were indications @entity103 may back down over the size of the £ 1.7billion additional levy when mr @entity2 holds crisis talks on the issue with fellow @entity1 finance ministers on friday			2
one senior @entity1 official said : ‘ there is widespread willingness to find a way forward			0

@entity2 said the @entity1 was ‘ causing problems for us ’
he warned the continent was ‘ pricing itself out of the world economy '
@entity1 says @entity0 would be charged interest if it refuses to pay £ 1.7bn bill
@entity17 wants @entity0 to leave rather than curb workers ' free movement
