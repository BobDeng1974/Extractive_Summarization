’ dr @entity6 has apologised to the couple for being insensitive , and the hospital said the phone call he took was ‘ vital ’ to save the life of another baby under his care			1
@entity7 arrived 13 weeks prematurely at @entity18 on september 28 last year			1
weighing just 2lb 2oz , she was transferred to the neonatal unit at @entity20 in @entity21			1
miss @entity16 and her partner , accountant @entity67 , both 43 and from @entity65 , @entity66 , kept a cot - side vigil			2
but their baby , whose heart was no bigger than a five pence piece , developed a condition called necrotising enterocolitis and suddenly deteriorated on october 30			2
medical staff tried to save her for more than an hour , before dr @entity6 ’s phone rang			1
@entity7 died soon afterwards , having suffered multiple organ failure			1
later the couple , who have two other children , @entity82 , five , and two - year - old @entity83 , held a meeting with a panel of doctors including dr @entity6			1
miss @entity16 said : ‘ he initially did not remember taking the phone call			2
he went white as soon as i accused him of it			0
a @entity91 spokesman said : ' staff are permitted to take urgent patient - related calls whilst treating other patients ' ‘ he swiped through the calls on his phone and said , “ oh , i did take a call ”			0

he apologised and then he could n’t stop apologising and he was still apologising as we left the room			0
’ the hospital carried out an investigation and concluded that the taking of the phone call ‘ would not have made any difference ’ to @entity7 ’s death			0
dr @entity116 , who chaired the inquiry , said : ‘ dr @entity6 was coordinating the care of many sick patients that night and thus having clear lines of communication were of the utmost priority			1
‘ by the time dr @entity6 took the phone call , the severity of her condition was so poor that @entity7 was not going to survive			1
dr @entity6 was not alone in the room that night and handed over the ongoing resuscitation to other appropriately skilled and competent members of staff			1
’ in a letter to @entity7 ’s family , hospital chief executive @entity131 wrote : ‘ the panel considered this carefully and concluded it had no bearing on her death			0
however they fully recognise it appeared insensitive and gave the wrong impression ... an impression that upset you both greatly , and for which dr @entity6 has offered his sincere apologies			2
’ @entity144 - educated dr @entity6 is a renowned neonatal specialist whose research has won him awards			1
in a statement to the @entity148 , mr @entity131 added : ‘ dr @entity6 and his team did all they could for @entity7			1
we repeat our sympathies to her family and are continuing our dialogue			0
’ a @entity91 spokesman said : ‘ staff are permitted to take urgent patient - related calls whilst treating other patients			0
‘ in the case of @entity159 [ @entity7 ] , one of the medical team treating her took such a call from another doctor about the urgent care of another sick baby			2
it was brief and , as an independent expert review has concluded , taking the call had no bearing on the outcome			0
