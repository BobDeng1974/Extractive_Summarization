by @entity0 published : 17:37 est , 20 may 2013 updated : 17:47 est , 20 may 2013 an @entity2 priest has been yanked from post after being accused of directly plagiarizing sermons he gave and even published in his own name since 2006			1
rev. @entity7 , 65 , led the congregation of @entity2 in the @entity10 town of @entity11 , @entity12 since 1993			1
that is , until recently when he was put on administrative leave for allegedly stealing sermons			0
they came , nearly verbatim , from a book called ‘ @entity17 ’ that is only available via an online subscription service at @entity20			0
@entity21 ... thou shalt not steal : from the tiny @entity23 father @entity7 ( pictured ) gave sermons for years that he likely cribbed straight from @entity20 the 300 or so families who normally attend @entity7 ’s sermons in the little wood - shingled village church received a letter may 9 from the @entity29 explaining what exactly had become of their spiritual guide			1
‘ this is a serious breach of the pastoral relationship between @entity7 and each of you , ’ wrote @entity33 @entity32			1
‘ i am sorry that this matter has caused pain and will likely cause further pain in the parish			0
’ @entity7 first raised the eyebrows of church elders a year ago when officials approached him with similar accusations			1
however , friar assured them it was an isolated incident that would not happen again			0
‘ we investigated further , ’ wrote @entity32 , ‘ and have documentation that not only did he continue to copy sermons and preach and publish them verbatim , in print and online , as his own , but he had been doing so for many years			2
’ parish the thought : @entity7 led the congregation at @entity58 's in the @entity10 town of @entity11 , @entity12 since 1993 but was recently placed on administrative leave as an example , the @entity61 pointed to a december 2011 sermon given by @entity7 in which he told a detailed story about a man who had ‘ @entity66 ’ sung at his funeral instead of ‘ @entity68			1
’ the same story , investigators found , had been used at other churches before			0
meanwhile , the opening line of @entity7 ’s version includes an aside about just how unbelievable some of his supposedly true tales can seem			2
‘ i keep saying that one of these days i 'm going to sit down and write a book because some of the things that have happened in my ministry need to be written down so that people can read them , ’ he said in the sermon , which was still on the church ’s sermon as of friday			0
pilfered preaching : the @entity29 says @entity7 has been stealing sermons word - for - word since at least 2006 rev. @entity87 of the @entity61 office said there were other instances			1
as many as 15 , according to the @entity91			0
and @entity7 , says @entity32 , is n’t denying any of it			2
‘ he admits to having done so , ’ he wrote			0
the diocese is now ‘ working out a final agreement ’ with the priest			0
so what becomes of a shamed priest after many years in the cloth ? not a tortured existence , it appears			0
‘ i 'm going to retire , ’ the unabashed @entity7 said			1
‘ i loved my time at the parish			0
i think i did a good job			1
’ c'est la vivum : @entity7 reportedly admitted to the plagiarism			2
' i 'm going to retire , ' he said			2
' i think i did a good job '			1

*reverend* @entity7 , 65 , an @entity2 priest in @entity11 , @entity12 is accused of cribbing others ' work verbatim and even publishing as his own
' i 'm going to retire , ' says @entity7 , who does not deny he stole the sermons . ' i think i did a good job '
