by @entity0 published : 13:14 est , 26 september 2013 updated : 13:14 est , 26 september 2013 @entity2 ’s new president has called on @entity3 to join an international treaty banning the spread of nuclear weapons , chiding the jewish state for being the only @entity9 nation that has failed to do so			1
the speech by president @entity11 came hours before a meeting that was to mark the highest - level direct contact in six years between the @entity14 and @entity2 over @entity16 ’s disputed nuclear activities			1
' almost four decades of international efforts to establish a nuclear weapon - free zone in the @entity9 have regrettably failed , ' mr @entity11 told a @entity20 meeting on nuclear disarmament on the sidelines of the @entity23			1
it has never commented on suggestions it possesses a nuclear arsenal			0
' no nation should possess nuclear weapons , since there are no right hands for these wrong weapons , ' mr @entity11 said			1
he was speaking on behalf of the @entity46 , which represents dozens of mostly developing countries			0
mr @entity11 also said all nations should be subject to @entity50 inspections and other nuclear safeguards			1
increased transparency , including more inspections , is a key part of the negotiations over @entity2 ’s nuclear programme			1
@entity2 insists its nuclear programme is for peaceful purposes only , and says it needs to enrich uranium to produce reactor fuel and for medical purposes			1
but world powers fear @entity2 is enriching uranium to build warheads , and has imposed strict sanctions to punish @entity16 to failing to halt its nuclear programme			1
in his debut on the world stage this week following his june election , mr @entity11 and his government have shown urgency to revive the stalled nuclear negotiations and ease crippling international sanctions			1
a meeting later last night was aimed at paving the way for the first round of substantive negotiations on the nuclear issue since april			0
the @entity14 , @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity83 will participate , with @entity85 foreign policy chief @entity84 serving as host of the meeting with @entity2 foreign minister @entity88			2
@entity89 , a joint @entity14 @entity2 citizen , has been in prison in @entity2 since 2011 after being convicted of spying it came after mr @entity11 said a deal over @entity2 's nuclear weapons should be struck with the @entity14 within three months			1
speaking ahead of a landmark @entity20 meeting between @entity2 and six world powers , he said @entity16 wants a quick resolution to the nuclear issue			1
mr @entity11 told the @entity99 : ' the only way forward is for a timeline to be inserted into the negotiations that 's short – and wrap it up			2
' that is a decision of my government , that short is necessary to settle the nuclear file			0
' the shorter it is the more beneficial it is to everyone			0
if it 's three months that would be @entity2 's choice , if it 's six months that 's still good			2
it 's a question of months not years			0
' the apparent thawing of relations between @entity14 and @entity2 in recent weeks has seen @entity11 apparently admit that the holocaust happened in an interview broadcast on @entity119			1
@entity11 's predecessor @entity33 spent years denying the holocaust as part of his rhetoric against the jewish state of @entity3 , one of @entity14 's strongest @entity9 allies			1
while the new president would not be drawn on the scale or numbers invovled , he is now facing a backlash at home after a conservative news agency accused @entity119 of wrongly translating the remark			1
the improvement in relations between @entity2 and the @entity136 has also prompted the father of an imprisoned former @entity138 to beg for his son 's release			1
@entity89 ( pictured left ) , a former @entity138 , claims he was visiting the @entity143 state to see his grandmother @entity89 's father , @entity145 , says he has a brain tumour and wants to see his son ' one more time '			1
right is a picture of @entity89 taken from @entity149 in which he is said to be wearing a headdress for a @entity152 party @entity153 is asking @entity11 to order the release of his son , @entity89 , as @entity145 is now suffering with a brain tumour and may not have long to live			2
in a letter , the ailing father says : ' i long more than ever to see @entity89 's face			0
i am now very sick			0
' i ask that you let me see him again , one more time , and so that he may lead our family when i am gone			0
' @entity89 is a good man			0
he is not a spy , i can assure you of that			0
' @entity89 , who has dual @entity14 and @entity2 citizenship , was arrested in @entity2 in 2011			2
the family claim he was visiting his grandmother but the @entity143 state accused him of being a @entity174 spy and convicted him			2
a short while later a video was released showing @entity176 ' to his crimes			0
@entity89 's father has reason to be hopeful after @entity2 freed dozens of political prisoners last week , just as @entity11 was headed to @entity181 for the annual meeting of the @entity23			1
earlier this month , @entity89 wrote a letter to @entity14 secretary of sate @entity184 describing his ' miserable prison conditions ' and his belief that @entity16 wanted to use him in a possible prisoner exchange			0
@entity89 's letter was smuggled out of prison and his sister authenticated the handwriting			0
the @entity192 said it was trying to determine @entity89 's condition through @entity195 diplomats in @entity16			0
the @entity195 represent @entity14 interests in @entity2 because no @entity14 officials are based there			2
the two countries severed diplomatic relations in 1979			0
two other @entity14 citizens are believed to be detained in @entity2 : retired @entity202 agent @entity201 and @entity204 pastor @entity203			2
the release of prisoners and the softening on nuclear talks are part of a fresh charm offensive by @entity2 following years of icy relations under the former president @entity33			1
as a condition of any deal @entity2 has said it will agree to international inspections along the lines of those between 2003 and 2005 and has not ruled out a meeting with @entity218			2
@entity11 added : ' if mr @entity218 and i were to get together , we would both be looking at the future , and the prospects ahead and our hopes for that future			2
' the notes and letters and exchanges between us are in that direction , and they will continue			0
we need a beginning point			0
i think that is the nuclear issue			0

@entity11 has chided the jewish state for not joining treaty
@entity2 insists its nuclear programme is for peaceful purposes only
world powers fear it is enriching uranium to build warheads
leader is facing *criticism* at home for accepting the holocaust happened
however @entity143 news agency says remark was wrongly translated
