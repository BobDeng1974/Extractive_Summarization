@entity0 was biting his tongue in a manful effort not to say anything controversial			1
but in the end , a moment of silence spoke louder than words			0
' did @entity7 play very well ? honestly , yes they did , ' he began			1
' did they defend well ? yep , we made them			0
did we attack quite well ? yep			0
did we play quite well ? yep			0
' did the ref have a good game ? ' it was at this point @entity0 tailed off			2
@entity0 was disappointed with several of referee @entity19 's decisions during his side 's defeat the @entity23 manager had spent the previous 10 minutes treading very carefully , openly admitting that any overt criticism of referee @entity19 would result in his bank account being debited			1
dancing around the controversial issues in front of the microphones has become an essential skill for any manager and @entity0 produced a masterclass worthy of @entity34			2
the contingent of nearly 2,000 @entity23 fans sang ' 3 - 1 to the referee ' as @entity19 whistled the end of a contest that saw @entity7 return to the top of the @entity42			1
@entity0 let their annoyance flow through him			2
@entity45 fires past @entity23 keeper @entity46 to draw level after the visitors had scored early on ' football fans are usually quite accurate , are n't they ? ' he said			1
he was aggrieved that his bustling forward @entity50 had been denied a penalty when @entity52 challenged him in the box , moments before @entity7 scored at the other end with a contentious free - kick			1
@entity23 captain @entity57 had collided with @entity58 on the edge of the box and the decision could really have gone either way			2
@entity63 was booked and @entity64 smashed home the resulting set - piece			2
@entity64 smashes home a free - kick , but @entity0 was annoyed by a missed foul in the build - up @entity64 celebrates in front of the @entity7 faithful after firing his side 2 - 1 in front ' i thought my team came and played very well and how we 've lost by two goals , i really do n't know , ' @entity0 said			1
' if i say what i feel , i 'll probably get fined			0
i really do n't want to pay because a referee has not done his job			0
i do n't want to pay for my opinion on it			0
' five minutes later , he concluded with : ' have i said that the referee is bad in his role ? no ' and exited stage left			0
well , he 'd said just about everything but			0
@entity19 's performance aside , it would be harsh to say @entity7 were undeserving of victory			1
their classy performances on the field this season have made light of their managerial merry - go - round			2
@entity97 continued their rise up the @entity42 table with an eye - catching 3 - 0 home win over @entity102			1
@entity103 needed just 43 seconds to score against his former club , before @entity105 and @entity106 struck to condemn the early pace - setters to a ninth game without a win			2
forest manager @entity110 said : ‘ collectively , we ’re a little too easy to play against			0
’ watching @entity58 , @entity45 and the other buzzing @entity112 is to wonder whether quick - fire changes in command are a good thing			1
@entity116 was exceptional once again			2
after scoring 22 times in 47 matches during his first loan spell from @entity121 in 2012 - 2013 , he has seven already this time round and must surely make permanent his move to @entity124			2
@entity7 resembled the @entity126 club in a replica of their black - and - white strip from 1914 as @entity129 remembered the fallen with a spectacular ' red poppy ' display in the stands and the playing of the @entity134 on the pitch			1
and @entity45 's first - half strike — a deft flick from a @entity139 ball — to cancel out @entity141 's opener will stick in the memory , too			1
@entity143 made sure of victory in the second half and the midfielder on loan from @entity148 echoed his manager @entity149 in saying there was more to come			0
' we can get better			0
there are a lot of games still to play , but if we fight like today we will have a successful season , ' he said			0
former @entity158 player @entity149 has an air of permanence after a turbulent start to the season that saw @entity162 fall out with the board , @entity157 quit for health reasons and @entity165 sacked after just eight days at the helm			0
one of six teams who could have ended the afternoon in top spot , @entity7 seized their opportunity and even @entity0 was deferential			1
' try and keep your head on it and keep going , ' he advised			0
' good luck to you			0
' what 's caught my eye			0
. @entity180 's revival under @entity181 continued with a 3 - 1 win over @entity183 , their third victory in four games under the new manager			1
@entity189 's @entity188 , who scored against @entity158 in midweek , was at it again with a stunning volley in their 2 - 1 win at @entity193			1
spare a thought for the @entity196 fans who made the 696 - mile round trip to @entity198 only to see their side behind after just 80 seconds			0
@entity198 won 3 - 0			1
@entity181 has done sterling work with @entity180 as the @entity203 club 's revival continued with a 3 - 1 over @entity183			1

@entity0 's @entity23 *crashed* to a 3 - 1 defeat at @entity7
@entity207 sees @entity7 return to the top of the *championship*
@entity45 was exceptional once again for the @entity112
@entity180 's revival under @entity181 continued with a 3 - 1 win over @entity183
