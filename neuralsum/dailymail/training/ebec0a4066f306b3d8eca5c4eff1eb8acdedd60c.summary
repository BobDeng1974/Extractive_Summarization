exposed to blistering temperatures , inhaling thick smoke and putting their bodies on the line to extinguish the flames			1
these are the conditions front - line firefighters are faced with while battling the devastating bushfires burning across the @entity9			1
footage of inside the inferno , which is the worst since the @entity8 of 1983 , has been taken by @entity13 volunteer firefighter @entity12 , whose team has been out trying to tame the fires since friday			1
luckily so far , the only thing the fire has claimed are properties			2
with a @entity34 strapped to the photographer 's helmet , viewers get a first - hand look of what firefighters are working to contain as temperatures are expected to hot 38 degrees @entity19 on tuesday and wednesday			1
in the eight - minute video , firefighters are seen trying to put out spot fires at @entity44 as smoke surrounds them and thicker plumes billow in the distance , with light from the fire turning the sky orange			1
the team mr @entity12 was with were very experienced - the cab officer and driver alone had 70 years between them			1
' they knew exactly what was going on , and sometimes conditions can look a lot worse than they are , ' he said			1
' we did what we needed to do and got the job done			2
we were highly trained and knew what we needed to do			2
' mr @entity12 has been a volunteer for @entity13 for nine years and he has battled fires on @entity64 where flames were 300 metres high			1
' we were a kilometre away but that means it could get to us in ten seconds , ' he told @entity68			2
but he had not seen any fires as bad as what he has seen in @entity28			1
' the flames were crowning the top of trees , and through the clouds ... the inferno was the worse thing i ’ve ever seen in my life , ' he said			2
' that kind of fire is crazy , that 's why the fire is out on control still because you ca n't put bombers on it			2
the water would evaporate before it hit the fire			2
' mr @entity12 said the conditions had been a massive shock to firefighters as it had not been brought under control in five days , even with the help of 200 volunteer firefighters from both @entity28 's @entity13 along with 200 @entity96 crew members and 40 from the @entity97			1
' that 's a huge amount of people and we still have n't got it under control			2
you think , " put water on flame " and it goes out , but that ’s not how it works			2
' wednesday will be a very questionable day			0
the weather is n't looking positive , and everyone is knuckling down and preparing			0
but mr @entity12 reassured people firefighters were more than up for the task			1
mr @entity12 has captured footage on a @entity34 strapped onto his helmet as he helped battle the @entity44 fires thick smoke is seen rising sky high over the @entity9 , which is a popular tourist destination in @entity28 it is thought more than 400 firefighters were battling the blaze on sunday as hot temperatures could worsen the blaze in the eight - minute video , mr @entity12 is seen putting out spot fires with a hose along with assisting other crew members the sun is seen burning a bright orange through the thick smoke billowing over the region , which is 26km away from @entity131 's @entity130 at one stage , mr @entity12 is so overwhelmed by smoke he starts coughing violently as it blows over a property he is defending he and his colleagues kick into action as flames surround a property they arrive at , which has flames just centimetres away from sheds and this is made evident by the way crew members executed their sweep of the @entity44 house			1
firefighters leapt into action , grabbing a hose to extinguish the fires as well as protecting the house by dousing its gutters with water as the sun is seen shining through the smoke with a red ring around it			0
as firefighters continued to storm the property , the video shows how close the fire is burning , with flames just centimetres away from setting a garden shed alight			1
at one point a plane is seen flying over the house as what it is believed to be the sound of smoke alarms break through the eerie silence			0
' when we were rolling up to the house within minutes it had jumped a good 500 metres			0
an ember sparked and all the other trucks went down to road where the fire was but we went up to the house where the fire front actually was , ' mr @entity12 told @entity68			1
' seeing something like that shows exactly how out of our hands it can be			1
we saved one house , and we did the best in that area we could			0
' that 's one less house on the tally			0
' mr @entity12 said the most devastating thing on the job was seeing people lose their homes			1
' you see people waiting on the side of the road at road closures , not able to get back in and you can tell that they know they 've lost their home			0
' it 's sad to see when people could have saved their house by being prepared and end up losing their homes			0
' everyone thinks " i 'll be right , we 'll be ready " or they think they 'll leave if it gets bad			0
' some houses are really hard to save			0
unless they cut down huge trees and even if they do prepare it 's tough			1
' we have a fire truck and we still struggled to save the house			0
' in the video , mr @entity12 is also seen running over to a shed where hay is kept , while a colleague looks to be watering it down so the fire can not use the tinder to spread			1
mr @entity12 takes up an axe to break - up wood lining the walls of the blackened tin shed to prevent it from re-igniting			1
a thick smoke blows over the house and it becomes too much for him as he starts coughing violently to clear his lungs			0
as the crew travel along the road , they put out spot fires they drive past with a quick spritz of the house to stop it from spreading mr @entity12 worked to spray down leaves in gutters to ensure the house would not catch alight firefighters from all over @entity28 have been helping battle the blaze since sunday , with conditions the worst since 1983 in 1983 , the @entity8 in @entity28 claimed 28 lives and destroyed 51 homes despite getting an upclose and personal look at the sheer destruction of the fire , mr @entity12 said ' the biggest thing ' he had seen during the bushfires was people 's willingness to help			1
' i 've had so many people call me and ask " what can we do ? "			0
they 've said " i 'll deliver sandwiches and water , i can offer shelter and storage " , ' he said			0
' it 's crazy how much citizens are banding together to help out , this does n't normally happen			0
' people realise that every little bit counts			0
if someone donates six bottles of water , that 's six firefighters who do n’t have to buy it out of their own pockets when they ’re already giving their time			0
' as for how mr @entity12 deals with fear , he said he tried not to focus on it while out on a job but on helping people			1
' i 've never experienced fear to the extent where i thought we 'd die			2
i mean , we 're all human and fear will kick in , but as a firefighter you need to be push that aside and operate on your skills and listen to your officers , ' he said			2
' we 'll never be forced into a situation that we are n't comfortable with			0
' what drives me is the ability to be able to help people who are in a situation where they ca n't help themselves			0
' all voluntary things are great			0
you 're there on your own time which means your heart is in it , and because it means people really care			0
