he 's been searching for a ' fox in the box ' since the days of @entity3 and @entity4 , and @entity5 thinks he might just have found one in his £ 16million signing @entity8			1
@entity5 , who also revealed his preference had been to sign @entity8 on loan from @entity11 rather than permanently , once mistakenly thought @entity12 had fox - like qualities but the in - form @entity15 striker might fit the bill			1
@entity8 is set to make his debut against @entity18 on saturday , with the @entity20 manager confident he has solved his striking conundrum and given @entity8 an opportunity to finally play his club football in a central position			1
will it be the same this time ? dec 14 , 2013 6 - 3 v @entity18 @entity20 had only just returned from @entity43 following a 2 - 0 defeat at @entity45			1
goals from @entity47 and @entity48 put @entity18 2 - 1 up at half - time , and @entity20 collapsed after the break to a @entity52 double and goals from @entity54 and @entity55			1
feb 8 , 2014 5 - 1 v @entity56 there were no @entity59 excuses when @entity5 's side went to @entity61			2
they had a clear week to prepare but were caught napping as @entity56 fired in four goals in the first 20 minutes			0
they never recovered from that blitz and @entity66 completed the rout			0
mar 22 , 2014 6 - 0 v @entity68 a 1 - 0 win at @entity70 the week before ought to have given @entity20 plenty of confidence but three early goals and @entity75 's red card for handball , despite @entity29 committing the offence , led to another long afternoon for @entity5 's men			1
@entity5 said : ' he 's happy and confident because he scored two goals for @entity15 in a very important game ( against @entity34 ) and that can only boost his confidence			1
' when you analyse his game , you think he has the qualities to play through the middle			0
at @entity11 , where you had many big stars , he had to make room for players to play through the middle			1
but he has the perfect style to play through the middle			0
' @entity5 rather cryptically claimed that nothing would have happened if he had not been on a trip to @entity96			1
he was criticised at the time for being out of the country on september 1 as part of a trip to meet the @entity100 , but said the journey was important both individually and for the club			0
' meeting the @entity100 was an experience i did not want to miss , ' said @entity5			2
' i am a @entity105 , so it was an experience , and one ( invitation ) i accepted a long time ago , and on top of that it was a game for peace and multi-religion understanding			0
' i thought today where we are a bit in front of an international religious war , it was a very important game			0
' @entity5 hailed @entity119 as ' a great person ' , who met the likes of @entity124 's @entity123 - winning captain @entity122 during the reception at the @entity126			2
' he shows humility and is available to meet for everybody , has a word with everybody , ' said @entity5			2
' he is a supporter of @entity131 in @entity124			0
he is a football fan , you can not be born in @entity124 and not be a football fan			0
' he spoke with many @entity124 , so i wanted to be discreet and say ' it was nice to meet you and bye - bye '			0
' @entity8 is expected to be given more chance to impress in his favourite central role at @entity20 @entity8 celebrates his second @entity15 goal against @entity34 with @entity142 on monday divine intervention is one of many theories put forward for @entity11 selling an @entity15 striker to a rival , a transfer that stunned @entity148 among others			1
@entity5 said his first instinct upon learning @entity151 had joined @entity11 was to sign @entity8 on loan , with a view to buying him next summer			1
he muddied the waters by suggesting @entity8 had initially only been available on loan , but it is understood a temporary switch was his preferred option			2
@entity5 held off competition from @entity70 to land the 23 - year - old , pulling off a coup in the wake of @entity166 striker @entity165 's foot injury and @entity151 's loan to @entity11 from @entity168			1
@entity5 conducted his business from @entity43 — a decision he defended by claiming the deal never would have happened if he was in @entity30			2
' if i had not travelled that day , @entity8 would not be here , ' he said			2
' i will tell you that story one day but that 's the truth			0
we are in 2014 and you can always be in touch with everybody even when you travel			0
the advantage of that day was i had to get up at 6am and i was available the whole day			0
' when asked if sir @entity180 would have sanctioned such a deal to a rival , @entity5 said : ' you should ask him			2
i met him by coincidence on wednesday and i would like to keep that conversation to myself ! ' @entity20 are sweating on @entity186 's fitness after he injured an ankle for @entity188 against @entity189			1
@entity5 said : ' the news is not bad			0
he has a chance to be available			0
' @entity8 chats to @entity192 during @entity20 's squad photoshoot at @entity30 on thursday			1

@entity8 was rarely played as a striker for @entity11
@entity20 bought the striker for £ 16million on transfer deadline day
@entity5 *famously* described @entity12 as a ' fox in the box ' in 2001
@entity12 failed scored just four league goals for @entity20 in three tough years
@entity5 said he would have signed @entity8 on loan if he had been in the country but was in @entity96 for deadline day
@entity186 ' has a chance ' to play on saturday against @entity18
