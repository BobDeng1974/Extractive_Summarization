by @entity0 last updated at 2:25 pm on 5th october 2011 for a vegetarian it might seem an odd choice of past time			1
but self - taught taxidermist @entity4 has turned her fascination with dead animals into a prosperous venture			1
the 21 - year - old fine art graduate , from @entity9 in @entity10 , spends up to 20 hours carefully extracting the innards of animals before lovingly preserving the carcasses and selling them on @entity13			1
death imitating art : taxidermist @entity4 with two of her rat creations at her home near @entity9 stuffed : five of @entity4 's rodent creations lay on her workstation , next to her taxidermy tools @entity4 's unusual hobby is even more surprising as she is a dedicated vegetarian who , by her own admissions , is ' very squeamish '			1
however , she is making a tidy profit with her cadaverous creations , which includes a collection of stuffed rats - one of which has been turned into a handbag			1
one of her special rodents sold for £ 67 on @entity13 and the student has put the cash towards a dream trip to @entity38			1
@entity4 insists her taxidermy enterprise is strictly ethical : she never kills for her art and only uses animals that are already dead , whether it is the rodent victim of her cat or roadkill she finds on the street			1
@entity47 enterprise : @entity4 says she never kills for her art and only uses roadkill or rodents caught by her pet cat she said : ' i have always collected things that i find dead , flies and moths , pigeon feathers , flattened dried out toads , skulls			1
so i think that it has kind of developed from that			2
' this gave me the idea to practise taxidermy on mice meant for snake feed as well as any road kill i would find			2
' i am generally very squeamish to most peoples surprise			2
some people get angry because they think i go out with a gun killing everything			2
' but when i explain to them that i use road kill and frozen snake food they think its fine			1
' it is more gruesome cutting up a tomato in my opinion ' ' me and my best friend , @entity75 are both vegetarians and she used to hate my taxidermy , but now she has warmed to it			2
' my friends and family are pretty normal about me playing with dead things and stuffing them			2
my mum even lets me do it in my room now			2
' @entity4 's collection includes 14 rodent works of art - some of which have already been sold or given away to family and friends as gifts			1
explaining her artistic technique , she added : ' if someone was to bring me a dead mouse , i would start off by putting it in the freezer for a few days			0
' when i am ready to begin the taxidermy process i thaw out the mouse			0
self - taught : the fine art graduate has given some of her works to her friends and family ' i make an incision right down the back from the neck to near the end of the tail , with a fresh surgical blade			1
' i carefully separate the membranes of skin from the skin attached to the head of the mouse			0
' it is important to wire the insides so that it retains some sort of posture and structure			0
' after i have filled the mouse with some sort of stuffing i sew up the back with a sturdy sewing needle and then begin to add finishing touches to the face			0
' you have to leave the animal for a while in the position you want so it will dry and be sturdy			0
' also if it is a very fluffy animal such as a baby rabbit the fur will need a lot of blow drying			0
' @entity4 says she is influenced by an old @entity137 tradition of taxidermy art , which stretches back to the early @entity140 era			1
she said : ' i am very inspired by the taxidermist @entity142			0
i used to think taxidermy was a very negative and disturbing hobby until i found out about his work			0
' taxidermy is a very delicate process and if done correctly there wo n't be any blood at all			0
it is more gruesome cutting up a tomato in my opinion			0
' @entity142 , widely considered to be a master taxidermist , lived from 1835 to 1918 and created famously strange scenes of mice , rats , frogs , cats and dogs all playing together like humans in bizarre scenes			0
his work was hugely popular during his lifetime - and many of his bizarre creations were displayed at a museum dedicated to him in @entity167 , @entity168			1
because of financial difficulty in 1983 the collection moved to @entity171 in @entity172 before being auctioned off in 2003 , fetching £ 529,900			0
