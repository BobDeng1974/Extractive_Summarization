@entity2 , 71 , was a healthy size 12 and weighed nine stone in november but her weight has since plunged to four stone and nine pounds in the space of a few months			1
her distraught daughter @entity14 , 46 , revealed how her mother was active and healthy when she suddenly stopped going and started to refuse to eat			1
mrs @entity2 has undergone checks by her gp , doctors , social services and a community mental health team but none have been able to explain the cause and say they can not force her to eat			1
her daughter has now released images of her ailing mother in the hopes of discovering what may be the cause of her mother 's sudden change			1
mrs @entity14 , from @entity33 , @entity34 , said : ' we are in 2014			2
in this day and age people should not be starving to death			0
' she would n't look out of place in @entity40			2
i am at my wit 's end			0
' it 's like seeing a ghost			0
i just feel like she 's going to die a slow and painful death unless she gets the help that she needs			0
' mrs @entity2 told how her mother had been active and outgoing but suddenly stopped going out and refused to eat			1
she said : ' it happened so suddenly it was almost like someone had flicked a switch and she stopped eating			2
' i do n't think she eats a thing when she 's at home and it 's so upsetting to see her waste away			2
i 'm watching her starve to death and i ca n't do anything to help her			1
' prior to that she had been quite active but she stopped eating and she stopped going out			0
since then she 's getting worse			0
' mrs @entity2 has been taken to hospital five times since she stopped eating but doctors say she has no physical illness			1
' starving to death ' : @entity2 , 71 , pictured in hospital , has lost half her bodyweight in three months			1
doctors and social workers have been unable to find a cause for why she suddenly stopped eating she refused to celebrate @entity68 at her daughter 's house as usual and by february 9 her condition had deteriorated so much that her daughter was forced to call ambulance			1
mrs @entity2 was taken to the @entity74 where she stayed for 10 days and underwent a series of tests - with no clear results			2
mrs @entity14 , a mother - of - two , has been off work due to stress over the situation and regularly takes cooked meals to mother which are left untouched			1
she added : ' i do n't know what 's caused this but there 's been no real changes in her life to spark anything			2
looking for answers : @entity14 , 46 , is trying to find out why her mother suddenly stopped eating ' her partner died nine years ago and she 's lived on her own since then and got along just fine			1
' i think maybe it 's some sort of mental illness			0
the doctors have looked at whether she 's got depression or the onset of dementia but then , when they assessed her , they said she 's fine			0
' it ca n't be a physical thing because she eats fine when she 's in hospital but she 'll probably be released in a few days and once she 's home the cycle starts again			1
' because the doctors do n't know what 's wrong , they ca n't treat her			1
' one doctor actually said to me that if she does n't want to eat then that 's up to her			2
' i feel like i 'm banging my head against a brick wall and nobody is listening			0
' the longer it takes for her to get the help she so desperately needs , the thinner she 's getting			0
she 's just skin and bone			0
' following mrs @entity2 's last hospital visit , a care package was implemented but mrs @entity14 said that has not not helped			1
she added : ' she has carers going in to see her but she is still refusing to eat and they ca n't force her			1
' it 's not their fault but everyone seems to be passing the buck			0
the care system is so difficult to navigate			0
' you do n't have to be medically trained to see that there is something seriously wrong with my mum			0
' when she was admitted to hospital the nurses were aghast at how emaciated she was			0
mystery : doctors carried out a series of tests on mrs @entity2 , pictured before her weightloss when she was a healthy size 12 , but could find nothing wrong her ' we keep being pushed from pillar to post and now it 's got to crisis point			1
somebody needs to get to the bottom of it before it 's too late			0
' @entity148 in @entity149 where mrs @entity2 is registered as a patient said they could not comment because of patient confidentiality			2
@entity152 said : ' when a person is discharged from hospital , the @entity152 works closely with the individual and family to ensure that a suitable package of care is in place			0
