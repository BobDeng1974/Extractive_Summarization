the days of awkwardly cutting an oval egg into odd - shaped slices to make it fit into a sandwich is now over			2
a kitchen gadget has been invented that squashes the egg into a square , meaning it can be chopped more easily and placed into sandwiches , burgers and onto salads			2
the simple device simply squashes the egg , with the help of a small drop of oil , to change it from an oval into a cube			2
for generations people have been chopping up circular pieces of egg and layering them on bread but being forced to leave gaps at the corners			0
but this device turns the oval snack into a cube ( shown ) a @entity35 - based entreprenuer has come up with something else worth getting egg - cited about after inventing a gadget that scrambles an egg inside its own shell			1
the £ 10 ( $ 17 ) contraption named @entity41 gently spins the egg , blending the yolk and the white without cracking the shell itself			0
the already - scrambled egg can then be soft or hard boiled - and its creator , @entity48 , claims the ingenious method makes them taste far better than regular eggs			1
the contraption , known as the @entity53 , is a jar in which hard - boiled eggs are placed and squashed into the new shape			1
a user simply has to cook their egg , peel off the shell , place it in the container and screw on the lid , which forces it into a cube			2
after one minute the egg will have moulded to a cube shape and can be chopped up ready to eat			1
the square slices can then fit to the exact shape of a sandwich			0
the £ 4.99 ( $ 8.50 ) gadget is 3.5 inches by 2.5 inches ( 8.9cm by 11.4cm ) in size and is made by @entity72			0
@entity73 , 33 , is from @entity74 , @entity75 and is the owner of @entity72 , who manufacture the @entity77			0
the contraption , known as the @entity77 , is a jar in which hard - boiled eggs are placed and squashed into the new shape			1
a user simply has to cook their egg , peel off the shell , place it in the container with a dash of oil , and screw on the lid to get the sandwich - friendly square eggs ( shown ) he said : ' the concept was conceived in @entity89 by a man named @entity91 and his agent then approached @entity72			1
' we then designed , sourced , manufactured and distributed it			0
@entity96 - q - @entity95 is something that started as a novelty but it 's also practical and people enjoy using it			2
' it stops the egg rolling around on the plate and it makes the correct shapes for sandwiches			0
' @entity104 , head of buying for @entity105 who is stocking the product , added : ' boiled eggs have been the bane of picnics and packed lunches the world over due to their completely illogical shape			1
to use the @entity115 - ber device the egg must first be hard boiled ( left ) before being placed inside with a bit of oil and closing the lid ( right ) the egg must be kept inside with the lid closed ( left ) for one minute			1
when it is taken out it will have been moulded into a cube shape ' now we ’ve discovered the @entity77 , we ’ve finally brought a little discipline to the dinner plate and can create perfectly uniform sandwich coverage too			0
' all someone needs to do is hard boil their egg and peel off the shell , pop it in the @entity77 , wait for a minute and it will be in a cube shape			1
' the product proves very popular in the summer months when people tend to eat more salads and sandwiches			0
' people have said they were sceptical at first but found the results were actually really good , and that their friends are all wanting them now			0

a gadget that can squash eggs into cubes has been *unveiled*
the jar - like egg q - ber is being sold by @entity149 - based @entity105
it works by placing a hard boiled egg inside , with oil , and closing the lid
after a minute the lid is removed and the egg is moulded into a cube
could have practical *applications* such as making sandwiches easier
