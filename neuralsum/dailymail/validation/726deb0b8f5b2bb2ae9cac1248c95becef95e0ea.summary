the captivating motion of various satellites orbiting our planet has been revealed in a fascinating @entity5 video			1
created by the agency ’s @entity7 in @entity9 , it shows their entire @entity11 - observation fleet and the paths they take around @entity11			1
while the @entity14 sweeps across ‘ diagonally ’ , in the video at least , others like the @entity17 series are seen travelling from pole to pole			1
it shows dozens of @entity11 - observing satellites currently orbiting our planet			1
they include @entity28 and 8 , part of @entity5 's long - serving series			1
and the @entity14 can also be seen sweeping diagonally across @entity11 the animation solely shows @entity5 's @entity11 - observing satellites , and not any run by other space agencies or private organisations			1
the satellites measure rainfall , solar irradiance , clouds , sea surface height , ocean salinity and other aspects of the global environment			0
‘ together , they provide a picture of the @entity11 as a system , ’ said @entity5			1
the animation shows the day of 16 february 2015 from 00.00 gmt to 12.00 gmt. while the satellites might look close together , the amount of space in @entity11 orbit is vast , and there is little to no chance of any colliding			1
in fact , they are all placed on specific orbits within their orbital bands that ensure the minimal chance possible of colliding with another satellite			0
this does n't always go to plan , though			0
in 2009 , a @entity21 @entity63 satellite and a defunct @entity65 cosmos satellite collided , creating hundreds of new pieces of debris in orbit			1
but the precision of modern satellites is best seen by a quartet of satellites known as the ‘ a-train ’ - @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity77 - which follow each other closely in their orbits			0
the two closest , @entity76 and @entity77 , are just 12.5 seconds apart , but this equates to 58 miles ( 93km ) in distance			0
the four satellites work together to provide even better observations of @entity11			2
‘ it ’s acting like one satellite with 15 instruments onboard , ’ @entity84 , an animator at @entity5 ’s @entity7 , told @entity85 , referring to the 15 instruments shared between them			2
the @entity17 series of satellites have , since 1972 , been used to measure @entity11 ’s continental and coastal landscapes at a scale where human impacts and natural changes can be monitored			1
shown is an illustration of @entity17 , which launched on 11 february 2013 construction of the @entity14 began on 20 november 1998			0
it supports a crew of up to six , with crews split into groups of three			0
the station orbits at a height of about 255 miles ( 410km )			0
it has a total mass of about 990,000 pounds ( 450,000kg ) and has living space roughly equivalent to a five - bedroom house			0
it completes an orbit of @entity11 every 92.91 minutes and moves at 17,100 miles ( 27,600km ) per hour			2
it has now been in space for more than 5,900 days , during which time it has completed more than 92,000 orbits of @entity11 , and has been continuously occupied for more than 13 years			0
some satellites , like @entity28 and 8 , orbit from pole to pole , known as a polar orbit			1
this allows them to see almost the entirety of @entity11 as the globe rotates underneath them			0
the @entity17 series of satellites have , since 1972 , been used to measure @entity11 ’s continental and coastal landscapes at a scale where human impacts and natural changes can be monitored			1
the @entity14 , meanwhile , has a diagonal orbit that keeps it relatively near the equator , which enables various command centres across the world to stay in contact with the crew			2
recently launched satellites on the animation include the @entity139 ( @entity139 ) mission , which measures the surface soil moisture on @entity11 , and was launched on 31 january 2015			2
a full list of the satellites and their missions is available at @entity5 ’s @entity146 website			0
the @entity14 has a diagonal orbit that keeps it relatively near the equator ( shown ) , which enables various command centres across the world to stay in contact with the crew			0
as the @entity11 rotates underneath , the @entity14 appears to move up and down in curves , although in reality it is always moving in one direction			2

@entity5 scientists in @entity9 , @entity21 have created a satellite visualisation
it shows dozens of @entity11 - observing satellites currently orbiting our planet
they include @entity28 and 8 , part of @entity5 's long - serving series
and the @entity14 can also be seen sweeping diagonally across @entity11
many @entity11 - observing satellites orbit pole to pole to see the whole planet
