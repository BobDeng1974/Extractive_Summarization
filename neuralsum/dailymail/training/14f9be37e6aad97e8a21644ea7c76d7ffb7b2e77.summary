millions of pounds of @entity2 aid money has been spent on building roads in @entity4 that were never finished or which are doomed to fall into disrepair , a report warns today			1
a major study of the £ 1.4billion a year of @entity2 taxpayers ’ money channelled through the @entity10 ’s aid budget , warns that the government has little control over how it is spent , despite major concerns about waste , corruption and excessive bureaucracy			1
the @entity17 gave the @entity10 aid programme an ‘ amber - red ’ rating on its traffic light system , suggesting it ‘ performs poorly ’ on value for money and effectiveness , and needs ‘ significant improvements ’			1
in @entity26 the @entity10 has now built so many roads that the network is ' well beyond the size and standard the country can afford to maintain ' in a report today it singles out the approach to funding new roads in @entity4 , which have benefited from hundreds of millions of pounds of aid money			1
in @entity36 , the @entity10 set aside £ 60million to build a 60 - mile stretch of road which would provide a missing link between the major port of @entity41 and the @entity43 border			1
officials spent two years dithering over the award of the contract , during which time the cost of materials rose by more than 40 per cent			0
the result of the delay was that the money ran out , halting construction of the road four miles short of the town of @entity55 on the border with @entity43			0
in @entity26 the @entity10 has now built so many roads that the network is ‘ well beyond the size and standard the country can afford to maintain ’			1
today ’s report expresses surprise that the @entity10 ‘ does not have a specific definition of value for money ’ , with the result that it does not bother to keep track of the issue			1
in @entity36 , the @entity10 set aside £ 60 million to build a 60 - mile stretch of road between the major port of @entity41 and the @entity43 border it also warns that neither the @entity10 , nor the @entity71 ( @entity71 ) are doing enough to clamp down on corruption			1
researchers visited @entity36 , @entity26 and @entity74 to assess how well the @entity10 spends aid money on our behalf			1
in one unnamed country researchers came across numerous allegations that a senior government official was siphoning off millions of pounds of aid money			2
‘ we remain concerned that the influence of this individual poses a challenge to the safeguarding of donor funds , ’ the report says			2
the @entity71 last night said secretary @entity88 shared concerns about the way the @entity10 aid budget is spent but neither the @entity10 nor @entity71 are currently investigating because they have not received a formal complaint			0
in a withering assessment , today ’s report says : ‘ there is no effective performance management system in place for @entity10 aid , which limits @entity71 ’s oversight			2
‘ the @entity10 ’s performance management and results framework are weak			2
as a result , @entity71 is not getting the assurance it needs and that it achieves elsewhere , for example from the @entity106			0
‘ slow decision - making and processes hamper the delivery of results			0
limitations to the @entity10 ’s risk management approach , as well as over-ambitious project plans , are a significant obstacle to improving the performance of its programmes and projects			0
’ @entity71 last night said international development secretary @entity88 shared concerns about the way the @entity10 aid budget is spent			1
officials said they would now investigate the allegations of corruption raised by the report			1
in a statement , a spokesman for the department said : ‘ we agree that the @entity10 needs to raise its game			2
that ’s why @entity88 is already pressing @entity10 institutions , @entity129 and other member states to improve performance and results			0
nothing in the @entity10 happens overnight but we are determined to get better value for money on behalf of the @entity2 taxpayer			0
’ meanwhile , in a separate report last night the charity @entity137 accused ministers of using aid money to support the interests of multinationals rather than meeting the needs of the world ’s poor			0
it said that support for initiatives in @entity4 by global food corporations was disadvantaging local farmers and could even lead to increased poverty			0
@entity137 ’s executive director @entity150 said : ‘ the expansion of corporate control over farming will increase vulnerability among the world ’s poorest communities , deepening poverty and hunger for years to come			0
@entity71 should be using the aid budget to support small - scale farming in @entity4 , not boosting the profits of big business			0

in @entity36 , the @entity10 set aside £ 60million to build a 60 - mile stretch of road that was never finished
in @entity26 the @entity10 has now built so many roads that the network is ‘ well beyond the size and standard the country can afford to maintain ’
