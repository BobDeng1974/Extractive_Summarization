while most of the families are awaiting a resolution from their homes in the @entity15 , @entity0 and a few other parents whose adoptions had been approved have actually taken custody of their adopted children in @entity41 , @entity7 's capital			1
however , they say that promised exit papers for the children are now being withheld pending further case - by - case reviews , and the parents do n't want to leave @entity41 without them			1
