farmers are calling for cavolo nero to be rebranded as ' black kale ' in a bid to boost sales			1
something posh , something @entity7 , a type of cheese ... all answers given when @entity12 shoppers were asked what cavolo nero is			2
it is , in fact , a type of dark kale			2
i 'm sure you know that			0
but 60 per cent of people asked did n't , and poor cavolo nero is feeling left out as we all go crazy for blending bunches and bunches of the green stuff			0
originally from @entity27 , the black leafy veg is now grown in the @entity12 too and farmers are calling for a name change to ' @entity31 ' to help bump up its popularity to superfood superhero			1
it tastes a little sweeter but is still a good source of lutein , vitamins k , a and @entity40 as well as significant amounts of manganese , copper , fibre , calcium , iron and the b vitamins			0
kale website @entity49 ( yes , this exists , and it 's actually pretty good , um , if you 're a kale fan ) explains : ' @entity31 is a close cousin to kale , which means it has the same nutritional profile and like its @entity12 counterpart , it is really versatile , easy to use and great value			1
from the research it seems though that the @entity7 name is sending the wrong message to our customers , who are confused as to what exactly cavolo nero is and are perhaps failing to appreciate that it is now grown in the @entity12			2
by renaming cavolo nero black kale , we are making it really clear that it shares the benefits of kale and we hope that this will encourage consumers to try this brilliant home - grown brassica			1
' ok then ... time to stick it in a smoothie : prep time : 5 minutes serves 1 place all the ingredients in a blender or food processor and blitz until smooth			0
or for a creamier drink try replacing the pineapple with banana and add some mint .			0

farmers are calling for it to be rebranded as ' black kale ' to boost @entity12 sales
