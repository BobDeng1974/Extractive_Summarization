@entity0 has issued a stark warning to the @entity2 vowing that response to any hostile action will be ' regretful but destructive '			1
as tensions over its disputed nuclear programme continue to rise general @entity8 , spokesman for @entity0 's @entity9 , said : ' we will rigorously confront any threat or hostile behaviour , and our response will be definitely regretful and destructive			1
' we hope this ( kind of behaviour ) would not take place , but if it happens then the history will remember whether the @entity17 or the @entity0 were bluffing			1
' @entity8 's words came as @entity0 claimed it had produced ' intelligent ' laser - guided artillery shells which can spot and hit moving targets with very high degrees of precision			1
' besides @entity17 and @entity35 , there are only three other countries which have this technology , ' he said			0
tension between @entity0 and the @entity2 have been escalating over the past few weeks over whether @entity0 is harbouring nuclear weapons			2
the unveiling of the missiles came amid this stark warning from the @entity0 military which vowed to ' rigorously confront any threat or hostile action ' the missile , unveiled on @entity0 television , have been described as a new chapter in the country 's weapons and military equipment today , foreign minister @entity52 offered to extend the current visit of @entity55 nuclear weapons inspectors and said he was optimistic their findings would help ease tensions			1
the three day visit by the @entity61 team began on sunday and followed reports in november that suggested some of the @entity65 's alleged experiments were focused on developing nuclear weapons			0
@entity52 said he was ' optimistic about the results of the visit ' without offering more details and he also told @entity71 state television that the @entity55 mission could be ' extended if necessary '			0
suspicions : technicians work at the reactor building at @entity77 nuclear power plant , 750 miles south of @entity78 the findings could greatly influence @entity81 efforts to expand economic pressures on @entity0 over its uranium enrichment - which @entity84 and allies fear could eventually produce weapons - grade material			2
@entity0 has declined to abandon its enrichment labs , but claims it seeks to fuel reactors only for energy and medical research			1
the inspectors are likely to visit an underground enrichment site near @entity93 , 80 miles south of @entity78 , which is carved into a mountain as protection from possible airstrikes			0
security : a satellite image of @entity99 - a restricted area in @entity78 - which was completely dismantled after it was suspected of harbouring missile equipment earlier this month , @entity0 said it had begun enrichment work at the site , which is far smaller than the country 's main uranium labs but is reported to have more advanced equipment			2
the @entity108 team also wants to talk to key @entity0 scientists suspected of working on a weapons program			2
the team also plans to inspect documents related to nuclear work and secure commitments from @entity0 authorities to allow future visits			0
oil prices have been driven higher in recent weeks by @entity0 's warnings that it could block the @entity119 at the mouth of the @entity121 , the route for about one - fifth of the world 's oil			0
last week , the @entity17 aircraft carrier @entity126 , joined by @entity128 and @entity129 warships , entered the @entity121 in a show of strength against any attempts to disrupt oil tanker traffic .			0

@entity0 claims its missiles can hit moving targets with a ' high degree of precision '
