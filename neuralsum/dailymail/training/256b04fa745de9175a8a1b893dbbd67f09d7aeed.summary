psychiatrist @entity0 and historian @entity1 discredited the romantic folklore surrounding the story of @entity4 a @entity6 psychiatrist and a @entity8 historian have teamed up to discredit the romantic legend of @entity4 and claim he was a psychopath			1
dr @entity0 and @entity1 also argue that the @entity12 bushranger , who was hung in 1880 at 25 years of age , never uttered his famous last words ' such is life ' , in their article which was published in the @entity19 journal			1
instead , @entity0 and @entity20 discuss the idea that the folk hero was a ' pathological liar ' and ' violent psychopath ' who led a ' parasitic lifestyle '			2
their article , titled @entity29 , @entity27 , @entity27 , analyses the mind and behaviour of the outlaw , beginning with his family life in @entity8			0
it claims that the early death of @entity4 's father ' compounded by the absence of opportunity and advancement , would have made it difficult for an even better man , with a stronger sense of self actualisation and internalised pro-social values , to have prevailed and prospered '			0
' in the chaos of an adverse early development which was devoid of nurturing and which lacked the presence of strong , responsible male role models , @entity4 modelled the social delinquency and disrespect for order and authority of his extended family and their anti-social associates			0
' the crushing poverty , disadvantage and insecurity that his family experienced as poor @entity63 - @entity12 selectors , can be speculated to have imbued the young @entity4 with an angry , defiant disposition and an aggrieved perspective on society and its norms and rules			0
' instead , they discuss the idea that the @entity12 hero was a ' pathological liar ' and ' violent psychopath ' who led a ' parasitic lifestyle ' the article summarises that @entity4 had no empathy for others , such as his victims and their families and that that he ' practised at repeatedly claiming to have been wronged ' detailing his early crimes , from stealing a calf at 10 - years - old to his escalation into a full - blown outlaw when he was responsible for killing three policemen 1878 , the article summarises that @entity4 had no empathy for others including his victims and their families			1
instead , @entity0 and @entity20 claim that @entity4 was parasitic in that he ' practised at repeatedly claiming to have been wronged ' and thus shifting blame elsewhere			1
they argue that this is evident in the way that he defended killing the three officers as an action of self - defence			0
this , in addition to arguments that he often lied and fabricated incidents and the lack of evidence that he had many friendships or intimate relationships , lead the authors to conclude that @entity4 was undoubtedly a psychopath who was feared rather than loved in his community			2
the article detailed that his early crimes , from stealing a calf at 10 - years - old , to his escalation into a full - blown outlaw when he was responsible for killing three policemen 1878 ( pictured ) @entity0 and @entity20 wrote in their journal article , that @entity4 's famous last words ' such is life ' , were likely to be a myth as the noise from the @entity121 chaplain and footsteps on the metal floor would have meant his words were inaudible to those watching from the floor below however , perhaps their most devastating claim is that the bushranger never uttered his famous last words ' such is life ' , or the alternative , ' ah well , i suppose it has come to this '			1
@entity0 and @entity20 write : ' the footsteps and shuffling on the metal floor and the murmured prayers of @entity138 , the @entity121 chaplain who accompanied @entity4 as he was prepared for execution , would have ensured that nothing of what @entity4 may have said would have been audible to those watching from the floor below in the cavernous prison hall			2
' the accounts published â€¦ are apocryphal			0
