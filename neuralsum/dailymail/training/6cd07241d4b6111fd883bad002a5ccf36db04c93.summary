after buying a cheap @entity2 van off the internet , three friends spent four months travelling around @entity4 on a quest to see the true beauty of their homeland			1
and they came up with one very unique way of documenting their trip : by taking ' selfies ' on a couch that they brought along with them at each stop			1
the brain child of university pals , @entity19 , 25 , @entity20 , 25 , and @entity21 , 24 , the trip was first planned so that they could celebrate @entity20 's recovery from a serious spinal injury			2
three friends road tripped across the @entity25 and documented their trip with ' couch selfies ' at each stop			1
pictured : @entity28 , @entity29 the university pals initially embarked on this trek to celebrate @entity20 's spinal surgery recovery the group bought a used @entity2 van to transport the futon during their four - month adventure after setting out from @entity38 , @entity39 the group visited everywhere from the snowy mountain tops of @entity29 to breathtaking sunsets of @entity42 before ending in finally ending @entity43			1
by turning the couch into a mattress , the students managed to save on space and so were able to bring their dogs , @entity49 and @entity50 , along for the 18,000 mile ride			1
since posting the images online , they have had an overwhelming response from other would be travellers who are keen to make the same journey			0
the trio snapped this photo on the train tracks in @entity59 , @entity29 in @entity61 , @entity42 , the friends dragged the couch to the beach for this sunset photo op the couch also doubled as a mattress when they opted to sleep in the back of their car			2
pictured : @entity69 , @entity70 because they saved so much space with the convertible futon , they were also able to bring along their dogs			0
pictured : @entity77 in @entity42 @entity79 views : in @entity81 , @entity42 , the group enjoyed the ocean - front view ' the water looks like the @entity87 , ' one of the friends , @entity19 said of their favourite stop : @entity89 , @entity29 @entity19 said : ' we bought a 1996 @entity91 on craigslist for $ 2000 ( about Â£ 1,260 ) , it had 186,000 miles on it when we bought and now it has over 205,000 miles but it 's still doing great ! ' our favourite place was probably @entity89 on the @entity97 in @entity29 , the colour of the water looks like the @entity87 and there 's also giant , snow covered mountains popping out in every direction			2
' we stored the couch in our van , on nights that we slept in the car , we folded it out into a bed			0
' we wanted to figure out a way to show how varied the @entity25 landscape is , and we thought we 'd do that using us and the couch			1
the group admits they 've had an overwhelmingly positive response since posting the photos online			0
@entity114 , @entity115 , @entity29 sitting under a gigantic tree in @entity118 , @entity119 , the dogs seem to enjoy the photo project just as much amidst a sea of wildflowers , the three pals pose in front of a snow - capped mountain background at the @entity126 in @entity29 the friends are on top of the world - literally - at the @entity130 in @entity29 ' we wanted to figure out a way to show how varied the @entity25 landscape is , ' @entity19 said			1
pictured : @entity134 , @entity29 the group often parked the van close to where they took the pictures to avoid dragging the futon long distances			0
pictured : @entity28 , @entity29 ' it could be quite difficult hauling the couch across different locations , we crossed a couple rivers and scrambled up a few rocky hills , but for many of them we just parked the van close to where we took the picture			0
' people are parked at the side of the road all over @entity29 as they want to photograph the scenery but when they saw us they 'd usually turn their camera our way and start snapping pictures			0
' it was actually supposed to happen last summer , but @entity20 got a spinal cord injury last winter and we were forced to postpone it a year while he recovered , so the trip turned into a celebration for all of us			0
