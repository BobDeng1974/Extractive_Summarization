by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity3 engine chief @entity2 has backed @entity5 ' attempts to crank up the noise in @entity7 , but fears there may be consequences to the project			1
the sport 's lack of sound has been a major complaint this year since the introduction of the quieter 1.6 - litre @entity18 turbo - charged power units that have replaced the shrill @entity19			2
in an attempt to increase the decibel level , and so ease concerns of disgruntled race promoters who are a worried about drops in ticket sales and revenue , @entity5 are to trial a device on wednesday during the second day of a two - day test at @entity30			1
approval : @entity2 ( right ) has backed @entity5 ' plan to bring back noise to @entity7 engines fellow power - unit manufacturer @entity3 have been consulted , with @entity2 believing the ' megaphone ' , as it has been dubbed , ' will work '			1
' we are fully involved and engaged in the work that 's going on , led by the @entity39 , and @entity5 have shared their initial results from a dyno test of this device , ' said @entity2			1
' the @entity39 have some acoustic consultants who have visited us and have had access to our existing dyno test results , including sound measurements			0
' they are doing some further work at our factory as we are in an exploratory phase , trying to respond to the subject			2
' we are also conscious of the fact some of what we are experiencing - with respect to the noise - is that it does what it says on the tin			0
' it ( the power unit ) uses less energy			0
it does so more efficiently so there 's less falling out of the back as noise			0
testing : @entity5 will be testing their ' megaphone ' device , and @entity2 believes it will work @entity67 : world champion @entity68 is among those who have hit out at the quieter engines ' @entity71 ( that comprises @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity5 , @entity74 , @entity75 and @entity76 ) has identified the need to try and do something to improve the perception of the noise			1
' as long as you do n't do silly things , there may be some potential to make a modest adjustment that makes them a bit louder and sound a bit nicer without in any way compromising the fundamental objectives			0
' @entity2 's concern is given @entity3 's slow start to the season , as they were plagued with problems in pre-season testing and are only now beginning to atone , is that time and resources are being devoted to a particular subject when all effort should be made on returning to the front			1
' this is @entity7 and there are unintended consequences to be careful of all over the place , ' added @entity2			2
fans : promoters are worried that with quieter engines the sport may not attract as many supporters ' i do n't sign up to the opinion they sound horrible			1
instead , i feel there is a positive message that has kind of got drowned out			0
' my short to medium concern is we must n't be put in a situation where we take a performance hit relative to our competitors , directly or indirectly as a result of this subject			0
' we are very determined to fight our way back to a competitive position and it 's important the noise subject does n't become a drain on that part of the project			0

promoters are concerned that new 1.6l @entity18 engines are discouraging fans
@entity2 says @entity5 ' ' megaphone ' device will work
but @entity2 *insists* the issue should not be *allowed* to *dominate* testing
