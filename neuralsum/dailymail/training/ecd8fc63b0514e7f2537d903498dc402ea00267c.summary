by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 : 17:55 est , 20 december 2013 @entity3 : 17:57 est , 20 december 2013 she used to be the neighbour that families would often see out on her evening walk , strolling around the community with a friendly smile and a cheery wave for everybody			2
now , after landing a share of one of the biggest lottery pots in history , @entity12 has become something of a recluse , forced to sneak in and out of her suburban @entity20 home in disguise and avoiding all contact with the outside world			1
@entity12 ’s neighbours in the picturesque town of @entity27 have seen her only once since tuesday night ’s @entity30 drawing , in which the 56 - year - old grandmother scooped a half - share of the $ 636 million jackpot and the biggest prize ever in @entity1			1
after taxes , she walked away with a $ 120 million lump sum			1
the grandmother also loved to travel with her husband not short of friends : @entity47 paid tribute to the @entity49 , who neighbors said enjoyed a happy home life and loved to travel wearing a large hat pulled down over her face and a collar turned up , a woman who looked like @entity12 drew up to the two - storey house in a car driven by a younger woman , thought to be her 36 - year - old daughter @entity60 , and dashed in to collect some personal belongings			1
they did not speak to reporters waiting outside and raced off into hiding , abandoning @entity12 ’s own silver @entity41 sports coupe on her driveway and ignoring the numerous flowers , @entity70 poinsettias , chocolates and other gifts from well - wishers piling up on the doorstep			1
“ if it was me , i ’d be gone too , ” said @entity75 , a neighbour across the street who said he used to wave at @entity12 ’s husband @entity77 , 74 , when he put the trash cans out			1
“ they are lovely people , very humble with a good heart , and i hope they use the money for good things , and going traveling themselves			1
” next - door neighbour @entity84 said mrs @entity42 is a keen gardener who spends weekends tending pot plants and enjoying time outdoors			2
" they love to travel , they went to @entity89 this summer , and i 'd imagine they 'll go to many more places with $ 120 million , " he said			1
@entity84 said he spoke often with the couple about their travels and family life			2
" she plays with her granddaughters outside all the time when they come over , " he added			2
@entity84 , who like mrs @entity42 works in the insurance industry , said he expected to hear from her over @entity70			1
@entity100 : mrs @entity42 , who is married with children , only thought to check the numbers when she heard about the win on the radio this morning			2
she was driving and called her daughter to check moving up ! mrs @entity42 is pictured with her husband @entity77 outside @entity107 - and can no doubt look forward to living in similarly lavish homes " she 's taking some time away to get her head around this and try to come to terms with it , " he said			2
" i 'm sure she 'll call when she 's ready			2
" even before their big win , life for the @entity49 , who married in 2009 , was already pretty comfortable			1
mrs @entity42 , who according to lottery officials used a combination of family birthdays and her lucky number 7 for her “ last minute ” purchase of the winning ticket , was a vice president and senior property underwriter at the @entity20 office of the @entity127 company			2
she commuted the 24 miles from home into the city daily in her new @entity41			1
colleagues at @entity133 , speaking anonymously because the company did not want employees talking to reporters , described her as a hard - working but warm boss , who often worked late hours in the office			0
“ we ’ll miss her but are delighted for her , ” said one , echoing the sentiments of a corporate press release from @entity133 headquarters			0
prize : @entity140 , owner of @entity142 in @entity143 , @entity144 , accepts a check from @entity144 lottery sales representative @entity146 after he sold one of the two winning tickets at his store lawns are neatly manicured courtesy of fees paid to the mandatory homeowners association and @entity155 and @entity156 cars adorn several driveways			0
on friday , the @entity49 ’ house in @entity159 showed few signs of life			0
the heating had been left on to protect against the winter chills but a succession of delivery drivers with packages received no answer when they rang the bell			0
a newspaper from thursday , with the headline : “ @entity1 woman claims $ 324 million ” lay untouched on the ground			1
about a dozen letters from financial advisers offering their services were on the doormat , alongside a script and letter from a company called @entity181 inviting mrs @entity42 to invest some of her newfound wealth into its upcoming movie about @entity186 , billed as “ a romantic comedy with a spiritual twist			0
” other neighbours said the @entity49 were private people who were always pleasant but rarely saw or spoke to them			0
“ it ’s wonderful that the winner was somebody who is such a lovely lady , ” said @entity191 , 62 , who has lived two doors away from the @entity49 for the last five years			0
“ i ’d see her out walking for exercise and she would wave , but that ’s the only time i saw her			0
” mrs @entity47 said she also bought a ticket for tuesday ’s draw and picked two of the winning numbers , 17 and 20			0
“ it gave me a chill when i found out a neighbour had won , ” she said			0
“ it ’s shows that the lottery is for real			0
i ’m going to keep playing , the numbers do n’t know where you live			1
” @entity210 said he knew little about the family , despite living right next door			0
he said family members , including mrs @entity42 ’s daughters and grandchildren , would visit , but that the couple was very private			1
none of the neighbours were aware that the @entity49 had filed a 1994 bankruptcy , which was discharged five years later			0
nobody was home at @entity42 ’s apartment 10 miles away in @entity223 , and two other daughters who live in @entity225 , @entity226 , have not been seen since wednesday .			0
