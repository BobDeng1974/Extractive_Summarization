my introduction to @entity2 did not take place at this boutique hotel ’s enviable ski - in , ski - out location in the @entity8 resort of @entity9 – it happened at @entity10 at @entity11 in @entity12			1
@entity2 proprietors @entity13 and her architect husband @entity14 suggested we meet there for cocktails as they were in the capital , pre-winter season , ‘ on business ’			1
i was impressed to discover that what @entity13 and @entity14 were really in town for was to check up on their 15 hotel staff – who spend a mandatory week working and gaining experience at the @entity28 before the start of each new season			2
a waiter mixes things up at the cocktail bar at @entity34 in @entity8 @entity13 explained : ‘ it exposes them to a five - star environment where exacting standards of service and composure are required at front of house while also learning to cope with the rigours of a slick and intensive behind - the - scenes regime			1
’ @entity13 , whose cv glitters with top posts in luxury hotels and catering , added : ‘ at the same time as training my staff to a high level , i insist they all ski or snowboard in their free time			2
’ and , of course , a fit and happy team that spends a generous amount of time on the mountain will only benefit the clients of her boutique , chalet - style hotel where interaction with guests is integral to the @entity2 experience			1
i finally got to meet the team on site after an easy , 75 - minute transfer by car to @entity9 from @entity71 airport			1
and they did indeed make a polished unit – enthusiastic , energetic , genuinely cheerful , pleasingly informal and disarmingly friendly			0
@entity9 is well placed in the giant @entity75 area , which has 400 miles of groomed pistes , linked by 14 ski stations across the @entity8 / @entity79 border			1
@entity2 proprietors ensure their staff spend a mandatory week working and gaining experience at @entity11 in @entity28 ( pictured ) before the start of each new season it takes a long time to get to know your way around vast ski areas like this so i was delighted to join @entity2 ’s ski host , @entity92 , who has no need of a piste map			1
due to a long - running relationship with the local @entity98 , @entity2 guests always have high - quality , @entity100 - speaking ski instructors for their lessons			1
hosts such as @entity92 are also trusted to ski with guests , make sure they do n’t get lost , point out the rich variety of peaks – such as the magnificent @entity106 cluster from the top of @entity108 above @entity109 – and crucially , as far as this epicurean skier is concerned , recommend great on - mountain restaurants			1
@entity13 enjoys skiing with guests when time permits			0
on one occasion @entity92 treated us all to a great morning ’s sport at the @entity109 sector before lunch at @entity119 – known as ‘ the goatvillage ’ after the population that takes over in summer			0
after the guests ’ day on the ski slopes , they usually convene at the @entity34 bar to swap ski stories and to try the cocktail of the day or complimentary flute of champagne			2
the hotel offers the best of all ski holidays			2
all of the bedrooms are spacious , luxurious and en suite			0
@entity13 ’s choice of @entity136 bedding , sumptuous mattresses , heavy , warming fabrics for the drapes and bespoke furniture and design choices throughout makes this the type of exclusive property one normally has to hire whole , and very expensively , for a week			0
but here guests can book one room for three or four nights			0
breakfast , tea and dinner are included in the price for each night booked			0
food is central to a ski holiday at @entity34 as @entity155 , a repeat guest , summed up at dinner			0
it came to ordering dessert and he said : ‘ well i like the sound of the apple crumble but i have to have the chocolate fondant with chocolate sauce and port ice cream again … it ’s become one of my five a day ! ’ @entity166 flies to @entity71 from @entity167 and @entity168 , with return fares from £ 84			0
three nights at @entity34 , located in @entity9 , costs £ 995 per person , excluding flights , based on two sharing			2
four nights costs from £ 1,295 per person .			0
