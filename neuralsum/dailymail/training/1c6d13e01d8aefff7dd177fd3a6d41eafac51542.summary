like all beautiful , successful women @entity0 had more than her share of male admirers			1
but few stars could have provoked such unwanted attention as that which the singer received from one of history 's most depraved and despicable men , terror chief @entity9			2
@entity12 as it might seem , @entity9 is said to have lusted after @entity0 , dreamed of marrying her and at one point even plotted to murder her husband @entity15			1
a world apart : in the mid 1990s terror chief @entity9 was infatuated with singer @entity0 , according to an account by writer @entity19 who is widely believed to have been his mistress the incredible account of the terrorist 's infatuation with @entity0 comes from @entity24 author @entity19 , who it is widely accepted lived with him as his mistress			1
it was 1996 , and just a few years later @entity9 would mastermind the most appalling terrorist attack ever to happen on @entity29 soil			2
but holed - up in his @entity31 compound he had different things on his mind , namely sex , smoking cannabis and dancing to western pop groups like the @entity37 and @entity38			2
miss @entity39 , who claims she was kept as a ' sex slave ' by @entity9 , said he thought the singer was ' the most beautiful woman he 'd ever seen ' and that he was desperate to marry her			1
in an autobiography released in 2006 , @entity19 claims @entity9 plotted to have @entity15 murdered before wooing @entity0 by giving her a mansion he owned in the suburbs of @entity46			1
and according to the her account , the strongly racist @entity9 puffed on cannabis before announcing he would be willing to ' break his colour rule ' and make @entity0 one of his wives			1
jealousy : @entity53 @entity9 plotted to murder the singer 's husband @entity15 before wooing her with a mansion in the @entity24 capital @entity46 inside his warped mind he believed @entity0 was truly @entity59 but had been brainwashed by @entity29 culture			1
ms @entity39 , 37 , who is black , claimed @entity9 scolded her for braiding her hair and ordered her to model herself on @entity0 instead			1
she recalls in her book : ' he smoked a little marijuana from a gold hookah , sipping his tea and instructing me that i was always to keep hot tea for his ' kif - canbo , ' to ease the burn in his chest			2
' @entity9 said only monkeys braid their hair			2
he told me that the singer @entity0 was the most beautiful woman he 'd ever seen and that she never wore her hair braided			1
drugs : @entity9 puffed cannabis from a gold hookah pipe ( file picture ) ' " i want you to fix your hair like hers from now on , ” he said			2
“ i ca n't put my fingers through it when it 's braided			2
" ' @entity9 kept coming back to @entity0			1
he asked if i knew her personally when i lived in @entity29			2
i told him i did n't			2
' he said that he had a paramount desire for @entity0 , and although he claimed music was evil , he spoke of someday spending vast amounts of money to go to @entity29 and try to arrange a meeting with the superstar			1
' it did n't seem impossible to me			2
he said he wanted to give @entity0 a mansion that he owned in a suburb of @entity46			1
he explained to me that to possess @entity0 he would be willing to break his color rule and make her one of his wives			1
' i tried to hide my outrage at his racist remarks , but it would come to pass that for the entire time that i would be trapped in his palm , @entity0 's was the one name that would be mentioned constantly			1
' how beautiful she is , what a nice smile she has , how truly @entity59 she is but is just brainwashed by @entity29 culture and her husband — @entity15 , whom @entity9 talked about having killed , as if it were normal to have women 's husbands killed			1
' in his briefcase i would come across photographs of the star , as well as copies of @entity116 , but nobody in the @entity118 believes me when i tell them this			0
it 's like they have this totally bogus image of @entity9			0
' anyway , it would soon come to the point where i was sick of hearing @entity0 's name			1
' miss @entity39 's story first surfaced in 2002 when the @entity128 newspaper published an article claiming she had had a forced sexual relationship with @entity9			0
later in a two - part interview with @entity132 she was billed as the ' @entity133 of @entity9 '			0
some claimed she had made up the story , and that it was impossible because of her afro - american heritage			0
but @entity19 has stood by her account and points out that yet two of @entity9 's twenty - five children are black and his @entity142 grandmother also could be considered a black woman			1
earlier in her account she recalled how @entity144 who she called ' @entity145 ' would abuse her			0
she added : ' we would be lying there in bed and he 'd say , “ african women are only good for a man 's lower pleasures			1
what need do you have for a womb ? ” ' i would feel insulted — not just to the heart , but to the soul			0
send off : @entity29 celebrates the news of @entity9 's death last year ( left ) and mourns the loss of the tragic singer earlier this week ' he would humiliate me by making me dance naked			0
it was such a strange thing , because for the most part he believed music was evil			0
if a guest at the estate played music , he would cover his ears until the ' poison ' was silenced			0
' but other times he would become this devout party boy who wanted to hear @entity38 or some @entity37 's			1
to this day i hear the song " @entity173 ” in my sleep			0
' i would be jerking around like a white girl — “ dance like a caucasoid girl ! ” he would say — and his eyes would track me from one side of the terrace to the other			0
“ your ass is too big , show me the front , ” he said			0
' @entity9 , you understand , did not know the difference between being vicious and being tender			0
' recalling the time she first met @entity9 at a @entity31 restaurant she said : ' i ran out the door , gripped by terror , and drove home			0
relieved that his henchmen had n't followed me , i ran a bath , lounged in the cold bathwater , then changed into a flowing silk robe			0
' there was a bang on the door , and i could hear shouting : “ hey , black girl ! ” when i opened the door , there was @entity9 and his seven - man posse			0
a cold bolt of lightning went through me			0
' but @entity9 was trying to be charming , despite the fear in my eyes			0
“ why did you run ? i just think you 're lovely and i find you intriguing			0
i wanted to be your friend			1
” ' @entity211 : the autobiography of @entity19 , is published by @entity213 and available to order through most bookshops			0

@entity217 boss said @entity0 was ' the most beautiful woman he 'd ever seen '
he wanted to arrange a meeting and woo her with mansion in @entity46
