' but i was vilified the most			0
i do n't know why the media fixated on me			1
i do n't know if it 's because i 'm a female but it did feel that the trolling and the press were focusing more on me			2
' presenter @entity142 , who interviewed ms @entity98 at the festival , said : ' when i look at the cuttings , it seems to me that there is an element of that , he tends to be called things like youthfully exuberant or boyish			0
disgusted : @entity0 , who apologised for her role in the incident at the inquest of @entity13 last month , spoke of her horror and disgust at the part she played in the prank ' it reminded me of a sportsman or businessman who get caught and are put on the naughty step , but if a woman does the same thing very often the media have a different attitude and she is going to be vilified and be a @entity170			1
