by @entity0 had he known he was heading for ' @entity2 ' park , perhaps @entity1 would have taken a different route with his helium balloon			1
but his fate was in the winds , quite literally , and after just 12 hours since launch and experiencing problems , he decided to cut his losses and crash on land , rather than risk further problems across the @entity15			1
dropping at a rate of knots over mountains and forest , he had no idea he was heading straight for @entity22 's ironically named reserve , ' @entity23 '			1
shattered dreams : @entity1 's lifelong dream to cross the @entity15 under a canopy of helium balloons ended in disaster in a forest in @entity22 , @entity30 it was n't until he was rescued the next that he realised where he had landed , and could n't resist a photo with the fatefully named park he eventually landed after a scary descent , five miles south of the park , but when he realised how close he had come , he could n't resist a photo with the signpost			1
mr @entity1 says his attempt to cross the @entity15 using helium was doomed due to ' technical problems '			1
the 39 - year - old pulled off a risky dusk landing in thick fog then spent the night in a bog in the @entity30 wilderness			1
however , his trip set a new world record for the longest flight of its kind using he world 's largest assembly of cluster balloons			2
incredible footage shot with a @entity56 camera shows mr @entity1 coming down fast through the trees as he prepares to land			1
the explorer frantically shears away balloons with a knife to bring him down to earth			0
promising : things seemed to get off to a good start when he launched sept 12 from @entity65 , @entity66 , to begin his 2,500 mile journey across the ocean but it all ended in disaster , when after just 12 hours flying , and having travelled 350 miles , hie started to experience problems with his balloons in interview for the first time since his dangerous crash landing , mr @entity1 explained how he had to judge whether to lose ballast or cut balloons as he tried to navigate a safe landing at 50mph over a forest and past a mountain , without being sure of the coastline the only communication he had with those following his crossing , was to let them know he 'd landed safely and would spend the night in his ' boat '			1
he did n't know where he had landed he said : ' before i could land i first had to clear over a mountain - there is no way to land any aircraft on this mountain - a helicopter , an aeroplane , or a balloon			1
' i was coming in at 50mph and i could n't tell where the coast was , where the water stops or where the land started			2
i could only see the mountain			0
' it was a very sharp sequence of venting and ballasting that got me down through the trees and onto the ground			0
' speaking exclusively to @entity110 , @entity1 also revealed cutting loose the hundreds of colourful helium balloons that had kept him afloat was one of the hardest moments			1
he said : ' it was heartbreaking letting the balloons go - they were like my babies			0
video footage of @entity1 showed how he lurched form releasing ballast and cutting balloons as he tried to dodge the trees and mountains the view from inside the craft as it crashed through the forest canopy shows just how dangerous a landing mr @entity1 lived through the explorer spent the night in the forest , with nothing but the swamp mosquitoes to accompany him ' but it was either come down on land or come down in the middle of the @entity15			1
' and rather than calling for help , the it consultant from @entity136 , @entity137 , @entity66 , made camp in his gondola among hundreds of mosquitos			1
he said : ' i had no idea where i was and it was too dark to venture out			0
' i had three bottles of mosquito repellent which i left for the people who helped me inflate			0
' i would have given $ 100 for one that night			0
the next morning , he assessed the situation and began to prepare the equipment to be rescued help arrived : mr @entity1 prepared to airlift his craft out from the @entity30 wilderness after he crashed at 50mph ending his @entity15 crossing attempt using helium balloons during the rescue attempt , the yellow craft became entangled in the trees @entity1 chartered a helicopter to winch the yellow gondola out of the @entity30 wilderness in preparation for his return to the @entity66 ' but i did n't want anyone to risk their safety coming out to look for me			1
i radioed my control center and told them not to put out a call			0
' the next day i found out i had landed in a bog			2
there was hundreds of mosquitoes everywhere			0
' the area that i landed in was completely impassible			0
' his dramatic journey also saw him almost freeze directly after take off when condensation from the ground began to freeze as he gained altitude			0
he said : ' as i climbed higher my hair froze into spikes			0
the intrepid adventurer was forced to cut short his incredible quest after just 12 hours due to technical problems and his craft was eventually retrieved from the @entity30 wilderness by a helicopter deflated : mr @entity1 , who has crossed the @entity186 floating beneath a cluster of helium balloons , said he feels deflated by his latest attempt to cross the @entity15 rescued : mr @entity1 said during his night in the forest , he would have paid $ 100 for some mosquito repellant sad ending : he was lucky to escape unscathed from his perilous landing , but the adventurer says he was devastated to have to cut loose hi s balloons , realising his @entity15 crossing attempt was over ' the water droplet on the balloons froze and started falling on me like snow			1
' i had to strip off all my clothes and change into new ones because they were frozen			0
" however , for most of the journey @entity1 enjoyed perfect weather reached heights of up to 23,000ft in clear blue skies			2
on sunday @entity1 chartered a private helicopter and winched his yellow gondola out of the bog in preparation for his trip back to the @entity66			2
although turbulent @entity15 weather was the main threat to the record attempt , a technical problem with ballast caused the attempt to be aborted			2
the doomed crossing all began on september 12 in @entity65 , after hundreds of supporters helped prepare the journey by filling hundreds of giant helium balloons despite fears @entity15 weather systems would be the greatest obstacle to achieving his dream crossing , the landing was blamed on a technical problem relating to the balloons in spite of his failed @entity15 crossing attempt , mr @entity1 still managed to break the world record for furthest distance flown in a cluster balloon the explorer revealed that ballast consumption during the initial part of his flight would not have allowed for the full crossing			1
" there was no way i was going to make it across and it was better to go down on land than in the middle of nowhere , ' he added			0
' i was going through my ballast too fast - i either had to land here or in the middle of the ocean			0
' the cluster balloonist was attempting to cross the @entity15 using giant balloons filled with helium			0
however , he still managed to break the world record for furthest distance flown in a cluster balloon			0
there were commiserations around the world - including a message from @entity263 boss and fellow balloonist , @entity264			0
lift off : the balloon launched at 6.30am but it only travelled for 12 hours before mr @entity1 made the decision to abort the record - breaking attempt his planned route would have seen him hitch a ride on winds propelling him towards @entity272 - potentially landing anywhere between @entity274 and @entity275 he became the only person to have crossed the @entity277 by cluster balloon in may 2010 , and the @entity186 in september 2011 he tweeted : ' commiserations to @entity280 , who has abandoned his up - style cluster balloon crossing			1
i know how you must feel ! ' @entity1 messaged his followers on @entity285 saying he had landed at an ' alternate location ' and was safe and well			2
the it consultant from @entity136 , @entity137 , @entity66 , took off on thursday september 12 at 6.30am est attempting to be the first person to cross the @entity15 via cluster balloon			1
following the crash landing , @entity290 , based at the command centre , said : ' i can confirm that @entity1 was forced to abandon the planned flight at around 18.30 est. the incredible helium balloon project sounds like the stuff of fantasy adventures , like the @entity298 film up ' thankfully he is safe and well and currently making preparations to get home			1
' while disappointing that he had to cut his quest across the @entity15 short , i know @entity1 thanks everyone for their support and encouragement			2
' despite fears @entity15 weather systems would be the greatest obstacle to achieving his dream crossing , the landing was blamed on a technical problem relating to the balloons			2
fans of the adventurer who were following his movements via a satellite tracker were first alerted to his plight at around 7.30pm est.			0

@entity1 , from @entity136 , @entity137 , had to judge when to *offload* ballast and when to cut balloons to avoid hitting trees when he crash landed
he had to clear a mountain and could n't tell where the line of the coast was
mr @entity1 survived his crash landing , just 12 hours into his crossing attempt
after a night in the @entity30 wilderness , he found out he landed close to ' @entity23 ' , in @entity22
