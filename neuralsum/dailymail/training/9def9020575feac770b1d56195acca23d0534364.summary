by @entity0 published : 16:00 est , 7 june 2014 updated : 16:00 est , 7 june 2014 supermodel @entity1 , tv star @entity2 and singer @entity3 are among the glamorous women who have been dressed by designer and stylist @entity6			1
so it should come as no surprise that @entity6 's home is fit for a fashion queen			1
for a start , it 's a stone 's throw from @entity14 in @entity17 's ultra-trendy @entity15 , where celebrities like to shop in the uber - chic boutiques found there			1
and the one - bedroom flat is on the fourth floor of a serviced apartment block - high enough up to escape the noise and hullabaloo of the streets below			0
the home of designer and stylist @entity6 , near @entity14 , is fit for a fashion queen its grand , circular reception room , which features a succession of windows with 180 - degree views , provides a breathtaking panorama of the surrounding area			1
however , even fashionistas sometimes need to move out of town			0
@entity6 and her partner @entity39 , who is a painter and creative consultant , and their nine - month - old son @entity41 are relocating to @entity42 in @entity43			2
@entity6 is putting her flat on the rental market for £ 795 a week but will sell if she receives an offer in excess of £ 1.5 million			1
that might seem a lot for a one - bedroom flat , but this is one of @entity17 's most desirable neighbourhoods and experts believe prices in the area are still going up			1
' you have @entity57 being completely gentrified five minutes ' walk away ; @entity59 just up the road ; the huge regeneration well under way in @entity63 ; and you 're only 15 minutes from @entity65 or the @entity66 , ' says @entity6			2
' and on top of all that are the changes @entity67 will bring			0
' @entity6 knows she will miss the flat - not least because she has built her career in the ten years she has lived there			2
after reading @entity73 and @entity74 literature at @entity75 , she was headhunted by advertising firm @entity76 , where she became a @entity80 account director			0
she quickly realised she wanted to combine the strategic skills she was learning there with her creative talents			0
@entity6 at her flat in @entity17 ( l ) and @entity3 in one of her dresses ( r ) so in 2003 @entity6 set up her own ' personal design and styling service ' , the @entity89 , in premises near her flat			1
recognition from magazines such as @entity94 and the high priestesses of fashion journalism - @entity96 , @entity98 and @entity99 - soon followed			0
the @entity89 evolved into @entity100 , a strictly - by - appointment studio where clients are offered @entity17 's only head - to - toe bespoke design and styling service			1
with @entity6 's approach - ' do n't be bullied by fashion diktats ... it 's all theatre , so just enjoy whatever role you 'd like to play and express your own style ' - striking a chord , famous clients soon came knocking			1
@entity113 , prince @entity115 's old flame , had her wedding dress designed by @entity6 , while @entity3 used @entity100 to dress her for her first @entity118 tour			1
the design house specialises in bridalwear ( @entity6 was a commentator during the @entity121 ) and the service provided is ideal for women wishing to dazzle on the red carpet as well as at high - society social events			2
@entity6 's talents are n't limited to the fashion world			1
she recently opened a luxury boutique hotel - @entity128 , in @entity130 , @entity131 - which she renovated from a ruin			0
a romantic dark - wood bed with brass studs , and exotic embroidered cushions and ornate mirrors her @entity15 flat shows plenty of evidence of a @entity140 influence			0
it is painted in sumptuous colours and there are hand - painted , crystal ruby and saffron - coloured lights from @entity131 , a romantic dark - wood four - poster bed with brass studs , and exotic embroidered cushions and ornate mirrors reminiscent of the honeymoon suite at @entity128			0
@entity6 explains that the bedroom is inspired by ' exotically oriental old - world harems '			2
she says it would not be easy to make structural alterations to the property - though she has restored a wonderful fireplace back into working order - and it is unlikely any new occupier could improve on her stylish decor			0
there is a £ 5,500 - a - year service charge , but this is quite normal for properties of this ilk in the area			0
though there is no concierge service , the lifts are efficient and well maintained			0
@entity168 , of agents @entity166 & @entity167 , says : ' @entity6 's flat is a special place - designed by her and with a thrilling circular reception room with great views over @entity15 and lots of natural light			2
they are over-used words , but this flat is unique and is simply stunning			0
