@entity0 may have claimed that his fiancée does n't diet and loves to eat @entity4 ice - creams in bed - but judging by @entity8 super-svelte appearance in her new fashion campaign , we 're not quite sure we believe him			1
the soap star turned fashion designer has unveiled her second collection for @entity13 and she looks incredible - as always - in the campaign imagery			1
after the success of her first range for the high street chain , @entity8 could n't wait to get started on her next line			1
' there 's lots of lovely coats , fur jackets and sexy @entity37 , which will be perfect for your @entity39 parties			1
' when @entity8 's debut range for @entity13 went on sale in early july , the hashtag # lipsylovemichelle became the number one trending topic on @entity46 in the @entity47 and remained in the top ten until the end of the day			1
so how does it feel ? ' the response has been incredible and i am so happy that everyone loves it as much as i do , ' she said			2
' it 's the weirdest feeling in the world seeing other people wearing my designs			0
a girl walked passed me wearing one of my dresses and i said " hi " to her because i thought i knew her ! ' perfect for date night : @entity8 cites this dress as one of her favourite designs in her new range and says she recently wore it out for dinner with her fiancée @entity0 because it was so flattering ( dress , £ 65 ) budding designer : @entity8 says she has learnt to go with her intuition a lot more the second time around and has only included pieces she would love to wear herself like this £ 65 blue dress , which she says is really ' different ' in the nude : the 27 - year - old actress says this range is n't as ' daring ' as her first collection but has still been designed with confident , fun - loving girls in mind ( dress , £ 60 ) lady in red : the star created mood boards when working on her range and noted that red was the hottest colour of the season so included lots of vibrant and bold red jumpsuits and dresses ( jumpsuit , £ 70 ) the 20 - piece piece range , which lands online today at @entity96 , as well as at @entity97 , @entity98 , and in @entity99 , @entity100 and @entity101 , aims to reflect the season ’s hottest shapes , fabrics and styles that incorporate both the @entity107 catwalk trends and @entity8 ’s coveted wardrobe			1
speaking about her design experience , she said : ' i learnt a lot from my first time around and this time , i have gone with my instinct a lot more			0
i 've made sure that every piece is something that i love and that i would wear myself			0
' i was inspired by the catwalk but also the things i love to wear			0
a lot of the pieces are perfect for creating the layered look and there 's lots of blazers that can be teamed with shorts , which you 'll often find me wearing			2
' i love the cami tops and i will be pairing them with a statement necklace , ' she added			0
it 's time to party ! @entity8 says that her latest drop is perfect for @entity39 season and reflects her ' classic ' signature style ( jumpsuit , £ 75 ) casual and cool : as well as party dresses , @entity8 has included some cool kimonos , leather trousers and classic white and black camisoles ( kimono , £ 45 ) @entity8 says that this range is n't ' as daring ' as her first offering and explains that she 's included some red pieces because it 's the hottest colour of the season			1
describing the typical ' @entity146 ' , @entity8 says they 're ' confident , fun - loving , girls who like to have a good time			1
' describing her own personal style , @entity8 said : ' my style is quite classic			1
i like block colours , i do n't like a lot of fuss , i 'm feminine and i really like the tailored look			0
' after setting sight on these images , it 's perhaps unsurprising that the 27 - year - old has topped the best celebrity body poll for the second time running			2
the former @entity163 star , who is engaged to @entity0 , beat off stiff competition from the likes of @entity166 , @entity167 , @entity168 and @entity169 to take the top spot			0
despite her enviable figure , you wo n't find @entity8 breaking a sweat in the gym or starving herself on a juice diet			1
