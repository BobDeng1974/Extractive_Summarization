by @entity0 shrouded in five acres of sprawling fields , this country manor seems to be an isolated retreat cut off from the outside world			1
but in reality , it is the commuting countryside - dweller 's dream			2
for at the foot of the rambling garden is a railway track - with a ' halt ' to stop passing trains			1
idyllic : this five - bedroom stone manor in @entity16 , @entity17 , comes complete with a victorian - era railway to the seaside village of @entity20			1
it is set behind woodland garden but the house looks like the picture of isolation shrouded in five acres of fields			1
it takes in views from @entity29 too as the plains remain untouched bonus : would - be buyers of this £ 425,000 country manor are at least half a mile from the nearest train stations in either direction , but get this private @entity37 at the foot of the garden that has 42 trains pass through it every week at high season - 30 in the winter			1
but you 'll have to flag them down as there 's no platform the five - bedroom stone house , now on the market for £ 425,000 , is set in the heart of @entity16 in @entity17 - half a mile from the nearest train stations			1
but with the victorian - era @entity37 running across their land , would - be buyers need not worry about driving the distance			1
a winding footpath from the house leads through woodland and a valley to the property 's halt			2
the 42 steam trains that pass by each week on a heritage railway line can be waved down by the owners - who can also request it to stop there when getting off			1
services run between the former slate mining town of @entity70 to the seaside village of @entity20			0
the halt is called @entity73 in @entity17 - which is named after the house that dates back to the 17th century and began life as a farm			1
it was created around 1900 to serve the farm and is simply marked by a small signpost next to the railway track			2
@entity81 : potential buyers will have sprawling views of the @entity17 countryside from their homely room , where the current owners have lived since 1975 fully equipped : it seems to have the best of everything , boasting privacy and transport , as well as a reception hall , kitchen and breakfast room , and conservatory the house that now stands on the property was once two cottages that were made into one property in the 1970s			1
it boasts a reception hall , a kitchen and breakfast room , conservatory , sitting room , drawing room and a utility room			0
it also has a stone barn which has been converted into a studio , workshops , stables and stores			2
the house is being sold by the family of @entity116 and @entity117 , who have owned it since 1975 , through estate agents @entity120 and @entity121			0
daughter @entity122 , who grew up in the house with her brother and two sisters , said : ' it was the most magical place to enjoy a childhood			0
' at the bottom of the fields in the valley is the railway and there is a small halt there			2
' any time people came to stay we would go down to the railway and jump on the train up to the @entity140 waterfalls nearby or up to @entity70			0
' it was just a case of flagging down passing trains as they approached the halt			0
' nowadays it is our children who have been enjoying the railway			0
historic : originally a farm , the victorian - era railway , @entity37 , was used by neighbouring farmers in the 1800s to get to the seaside town of @entity20 connected : owners simply have to flag down trains to get to and from their retreat to busy towns - endless entertainment for the current owners ' children ' the house means so much to our family but we have all moved away and it has become too much to look after			1
' @entity164 , secretary of the @entity165 , said that halts were the forerunners to full - blown train stations and served rural communities			0
he said : ' people would stand at the halt and hail approaching trains which would stop to pick them up			2
' likewise , if you were on the train you pre-warned the guard that you wanted to alight at a particular halt			0
' once very much a feature of @entity181 ’s railways , some halts from the early 20th century still exist , and still operate on the request system			0
' but they are not very common these days , and it is quite unusual to find a halt in such simple form adjacent to a private house			0
' @entity188 , from @entity120 and @entity121 , said : ' this house has one of the most beautiful views imaginable embracing both the @entity29 and the hills of @entity16			1
' you can really feel its been a much loved family home and there is a wonderful feel of timelessness about it			0
' there can be few houses which enjoy the novelty of its own private halt from where you can wave down the steam train which travels up and down the valley			0
