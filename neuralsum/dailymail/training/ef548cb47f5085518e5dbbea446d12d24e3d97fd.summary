now , @entity11 's controversial documentary about the death of @entity1 and @entity2 , will not be shown anywhere else in the world			1
@entity15 had been set to premiere in the @entity16 on august 31 on the 15th anniversary of her death and was also set to open in cinemas in @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25			2
@entity11 had accused the @entity26 of masterminding the car crash that caused the death of @entity1 as a ' warning ' to her to toe the line			2
in the documentary @entity29 is also branded a ' @entity32 - style psychopath ' who ' orchestrated the murder ' , while the @entity35 was dismissed as a ' gangster in a tiara '			1
@entity11 said the @entity38 had ' got away with murder ' because no one had been held to account over the accident			2
it premiered in @entity7 last year but critics dismissed it as ' absurd ' , ' twaddle ' and ' unlawfully dull '			1
@entity11 admitted he had struggled to get interest in the @entity9 because of strict libel laws but insisted there was global demand for his project , but it has now been shelved indefinitely after distributors failed to secure the necessary insurance to bring in to cinemas			1
a spokesman for the film said : ' @entity15 has been sold all around the world			2
but there was a specific form of insurance needed by the @entity16 distributors to cover them for their @entity64 and @entity9 offices			0
' this proved impossible to secure			0
the film has been withdrawn in perpetuity			0
' without the distributors would not be covered for the expense of any libel litigation brought through their @entity64 or @entity9 offices			0
the production was backed by @entity2 's father @entity73 , who invested £ 2.5 million in bringing it to screen			1
the controversial documentary @entity15 , by @entity11 , right , accuses the @entity26 of masterminding the car - crash which killed @entity1 and @entity2 in 1997 in the film , the inquest in to her death is presented as a cover - up in which different arms of the @entity9 establishment - including the police , the @entity86 , and the @entity26 , as well as the @entity64 coroner and government - had a hand			1
@entity15 opens with details of a letter penned by @entity1 to her @entity92 , in which she claims that prince @entity93 is planning to have her murdered in a car accident			0
@entity2 's father @entity73 , former owner of @entity96 , invested £ 2.5 million in the project the production stated the 36 - year - old could have been saved had she been taken to hospital quickly - and that the inquest failed to properly investigate why			1
the film shows the graphic black and white close - up of @entity1 taken moments after the @entity105 carrying the couple crashed in a @entity108 underpass , for a few seconds			2
the distressing image , in which her blonde hair and features clearly visible , has never been publicly seen in this @entity9			0
@entity11 said : ' the photo is not used in the film for the purpose of shock			0
it is included as evidence , because it shows clearly that , although @entity1 had been injured in the crash , she was alert and very much alive			0
i repeat : it is not a picture of a dying woman			0
' as medical evidence presented at the inquest confirmed , if @entity1 had been taken promptly to hospital by dr @entity128 , she could well have survived			0
he added : ' using the picture is not sensational - it illustrates the story			2
' the film features @entity73 accusing the @entity26 of being racist - and in particular prince @entity29			1
@entity11 , who authors the documentary , suggests in it that the @entity140 was unhappy with @entity1 's relationship with @entity2 , because he was a @entity142 , and it would have caused problems had the pair married			1
it also claims that her role in the anti-landmine campaign put her at risk from those in the arms industry , and those in power who had links to it			0
in 2008 , after a six - month inquest which heard evidence from 250 witnesses and cost taxpayers an estimated £ 12million , a jury concluded that princess @entity1 and @entity2 were unlawfully killed as a direct result of grossly negligent driving by drunk chauffeur @entity162 , who also died in the crash			1
