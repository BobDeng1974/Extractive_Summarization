a self - styled ' ditzy ' blonde @entity1 fan was today revealed as the one of the brainiest @entity3 girls around after it was discovered she has a higher iq than @entity6			1
@entity7 , 16 , stunned her teachers by scoring 161 on the @entity10 brain test after she was entered with other pupils from her school			1
the teenager loves fake tanning , having blonde highlights , manicures and getting glammed up for @entity1 parties with her friend			1
but it appears that as well as being very pretty , she also has a beautiful brain			2
bright spark : @entity7 , 16 , has an iq of 161 which is smarter than @entity6 , @entity22 , and @entity23 - but still loves trash tv like @entity1 this daughter of a black cab driver and dreams of one day being a performer in the @entity29 - like @entity3 celebrity @entity30			1
but her amazing brain test score means she is brighter than professor @entity23 , @entity22 and even @entity6 - who all have an iq of 160			2
@entity32 has been enrolled in prestigious high - iq society @entity10 , which means she is officially in the top one per cent of cleverest people in the world			2
the schoolgirl , who is already predicted straight a 's and a * 's for her @entity38 's , and says she is delighted to have ' blown away ' the @entity3 stereotype			1
talented : @entity40 could end up going to @entity41 but the pretty teenager dreams of being a star on the @entity29 stage having already worked with @entity45 @entity40 , of @entity46 , @entity3 , said : ' it was such an achievement and i got a bit tearful to tell you the truth			1
@entity52 - 180 dr. @entity53 - 170 @entity54 -165 @entity23 – 160 @entity55 – 160 @entity22 - 160 @entity56 - 154 @entity57 - 145 @entity58 - 140 @entity59 - 119 ' i was one of the last people to get my result and everybody before me had got around the 130 mark so that was the kind of result i was expecting			2
' my teachers knew i was quite clever because of my grades but they had always thought i was blonde and a bit ditzy			2
' now they keep saying ' i did n't realise you were that clever '			0
' the teenager , who loves to look ' reem , ' or great , added : ' i am blonde , i do wear make - up and i do go out			1
' i love my fake tan and fake nails as well so i guess i am a bit of an @entity3 girl in that sense			1
' i watch @entity1 and i love the programme , it 's addictive but now most people do seem to think that 's what everyone in @entity3 is like			1
' i love living in @entity3 and i 'm glad that i might be able to show people that we are n't all ditzy and blonde			1
' passion : the 16 - year - old hopes that she can use her brain to build a successful future but admits she was pleasantly surprised to have such a high iq @entity40 , is a pupil at @entity93 , @entity46 , @entity3 , took the @entity10 - accredited iq test earlier this month along with other high acheivers at her school			1
the dedicated pupil - head girl of her primary school and currently a prefect - was already considered bright after scoring a double a * in her science gcse , which she took a year early			0
but she was stunned when she received her results , showing she has a higher iq than some of the world 's greatest minds			0
she is now aiming to take a-levels in art , physics and maths after her gcses , this summer , and would love to study architecture degree at the @entity41			1
but the prodigal teenager has already performed in the @entity29 for two years as part of the chorus for @entity45 smash - hit @entity115 , with @entity116 , from 2007			0
happy : @entity40 admits that she is a typical @entity3 girl but hopes she can help change the reputation of young women from the county - who are often portrayed as dim her proud parents , father @entity123 , 45 , a @entity125 cabbie , and mother @entity126 , 45 , deputy head of a primary school , say they will be happy whichever path their gifted daughter chooses			1
@entity126 , 45 , said : ' living in this area there is a lot of pressure to be the stereotypical @entity3 girl but she has a a real nice support from the other girls			1
teachers : ' they had always thought i was blonde and a bit ditzy ' , she said , but her iq test has dispelled any myths about her intellect ' most of the time @entity3 gets a bit of a negative press			1
people think all girls are blonde and all girls are dim			2
' @entity40 is blonde but it does seem like she has shaken the stereotype that all @entity3 girls are stupid			1
' she does love @entity1 but she sees it as what it is			0
a lot of the young people in @entity3 think that it is one of the only ways to be successful			2
' @entity40 and her friends are n't as bad as some of the girls in the area but they do like to dress up and look good			2
' @entity3 girls are all well groomed and @entity40 is n't any different			1
her and her friends like to go out and get dressed up in nice clothes			0
' there 's nothing wrong with the @entity1 cast and everyone in @entity3 loves the programme but its just nice for us all to get a good reputation for academic success for a change			1
' ' obviously i am really proud			0
i am quite shy and i do n't like boasting but i am really pleased that she has done so well			0
' all her teachers have been coming up to her and saying they did n't realise how intelligent se actually was			0
' i do n't know who she got it from			0
me and my husband should get tested as well			0
' @entity6 himself never took an iq test as none of the modern intelligence tests existed during the course of his life			0
but experts have believed for a number of years now that the iconic scientist had an iq of around 160 - just short of @entity3 's brightest teen			2
the @entity192 for 301 historic geniuses published by @entity195 psychologist @entity194 has calculated the iq of @entity6 and a number of other historic figures			0
the iq test is designed to test a range of abilities to determine the level of intelligence of the student - in the @entity205 the average score is 100			0
enjoyment : @entity40 says she likes to watch @entity1 and will sometimes dress like the women on the show @entity40 sat the @entity211 test under supervision from @entity10 and achieved 161 - one point short of the maximum score you can get if you are under 18			0
adults take the same test as the one @entity40 sat but because they have more developed brains @entity10 will only score them a maximum of 161			0
this is because a different mathematical equation is used to convert an adult 's score into an iq rating , than is used to convert a child 's			0
a number of different iq tests exist and @entity10 will accept applicants into the exclusive group if they provide evidence of their exceptional performances in other respective tests			0
@entity10 chief executive @entity234 said : ' @entity7 achieved a score in the top two percent on a @entity10 iq test making her eligible to join @entity10			2
' @entity40 's school recently took advantage of @entity10 's @entity240 scheme allowing schools to offer iq tests to pupils aged over 10 and a half within the school setting			0

@entity7 , 16 , wants to ' blow away ' the negative view of @entity3 girls
planning to study a-levels and hopefully applying to @entity41
but she loves watching trash tv , having blonde highlights and manicures
her dream is to become a @entity257 like idol @entity30
