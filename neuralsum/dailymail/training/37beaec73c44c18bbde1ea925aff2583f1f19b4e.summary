by @entity1 reporter published : 09:46 est , 13 january 2013 updated : 03:19 est , 14 january 2013 an armed mob set out into the @entity3 on saturday to flush out a scaly invader			1
it sounds like the second act of a sci - fi horror flick but , really , it 's pretty much @entity3 's plan for dealing with an infestation of @entity12 pythons that are eating their way through a fragile ecosystem			1
nearly 800 people signed up for the month - long ' @entity17 ' that started saturday afternoon			1
the vast majority - 749 - are members of the general public who lack the permits usually required to harvest pythons on public lands			2
around 800 people have signed up to hunt the snake during the 2013 @entity17 fighting back : hunters @entity31 ( left ) and @entity32 ( right ) from @entity33 , @entity3 , leave their campsite in the @entity35 for a five - day python hunt ' we feel like anybody can get out in the @entity3 and figure out how to try and find these things , ' said @entity40 , executive director of the @entity41			1
' it 's very safe , getting out in the @entity3			2
people do it all the time			0
' twenty - eight python permit holders also joined the hunt at various locations in the @entity3			1
the state is offering cash prizes to whoever brings in the longest python and whoever bags the most pythons by the time the competition ends at midnight feb. 10			2
dozens of would - be python hunters showed up for some last - minute training in snake handling saturday morning at the @entity59 @entity58 in @entity60			2
captain @entity61 , of @entity64 's @entity63 unit , displays a python during the kick - off ceremonies in @entity60 , @entity3 , on saturday			1
this 13 - foot snake was captured a year ago swimming in a backyard pool signing up : hundreds of participants volunteered for the hunting event that began on saturday on the trail : @entity72 ( right ) and @entity73 ( left ) head into the @entity3 in the search of pythons the training came down to common sense : drink water , wear sunscreen , do n't get bitten by anything and do n't shoot anyone			1
many of the onlookers dressed in camouflage , though they probably did n't have to worry about spooking the snakes			0
they would have a much harder time spotting the splotchy , tan pythons in the long green grasses and woody brush of the @entity3			1
' it 's advantage - snake , ' mechanical engineer @entity72 concluded after slashing his way through a quarter - mile of scratchy sawgrass , dried leaves and woody overgrowth near a campsite in the @entity35 , which is about 50 miles southeast of @entity96 and is supervised by the @entity97			0
@entity72 , of @entity98 , and friend @entity73 of @entity99 , a statistician in computer security , holstered large knives and pistols on their hips , so they 'd be ready for any python that crossed their path			0
the snakes can grow to more than 20 feet in length			1
@entity72 battles through thick brush in search for @entity12 pythons , also described as the ' zombies of the @entity3 ' captain @entity61 explains the problem to the media with the help of an 85 - pound python the most useful tool they had , though , was the key fob to their car			1
@entity73 wanted to know that they had n't wandered too far into the wilderness , so @entity72 clicked the fob until a reassuring beep from their car chirped softly through the brush			0
the recommended method for killing pythons is the same for killing zombies : a gunshot to the brain , or decapitation to reduce the threat			1
( @entity134 does n't approve of the latter method , though			0
) pythons are kind of the zombies of the @entity3 , though their infestation is less deadly to humans			1
the snakes have no natural predators , they can eat anything in their way , they can reproduce in large numbers and they do n't belong here			0
ready for combat : @entity72 is prepared with a knife should encounter a python			0
but he told media the situation is ' advantage - snake ' @entity3 currently prohibits possession or sale of the pythons for use as pets , and federal law bans the importation and interstate sale of the species			1
wildlife experts say pythons are just the tip of the invasive species iceberg			0
@entity3 is home to more exotic species of amphibians and reptiles than anywhere else in the world , said @entity172 , dean of research for the @entity59 's @entity174			2
roughly 2,050 pythons have been harvested in @entity3 since 2000 , according to the conservation commission			2
it 's unknown exactly how many are slithering through the wetlands			0
officials hope the competition will help rid the @entity3 of the invaders while raising awareness about the risks that exotic species pose to @entity3 's native wildlife			2
@entity72 and @entity73 emerged from the @entity3 empty - handed saturday , but they planned to return sunday , hoping for cooler temperatures that would drive heat - seeking snakes into sunny patches along roads and levees			1
@entity73 still deemed the hunt a success			0
' for me , i take back to my friends and community that there is a beautiful environment out here			0
it 's opening the picture from just the python issue to the issue of how do we protect our environment , ' she said			0
careful lookout : another hunter , @entity205 , uses a golf cart as he searches for snakes with his son			0

snakes can grow to 20 feet in length and recommended killing method is a gunshot to the head
