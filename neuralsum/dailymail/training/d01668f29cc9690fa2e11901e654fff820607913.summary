@entity1 captain @entity0 accepts his side must lift their game to an even higher level if they are to pull off another upset in their two - legged @entity6 semi-final against @entity8			1
but the @entity10 midfielder insists if the tie is still alive after wednesday night 's first leg at @entity13 , @entity15 's cup specialists will have " a brilliant chance " in the return leg at @entity18			1
@entity15 's @entity24 side have beaten @entity25 and @entity26 to reach the last four and if that was not enough to serve @entity8 with a big enough warning , the @entity20 ' exploits in the @entity21 these past two seasons add extra credence to their latest challenge			1
club - captain @entity0 accepts his side will have to be at their very best to beat @entity31 " there 's a lot to play for and i 'm sure @entity8 will be fired up , " @entity0 said			1
" they 'll look at our previous results and performances in other cup games and i 'm sure they 'll take note of that			0
" they wo n't underestimate us , especially as we 've come so far and they 'll be looking to finish it in the first leg , so we 've got to be on our guard			0
" i just hope we can keep the tie alive			0
if we can , coming back to @entity18 will give us a brilliant chance			2
" @entity15 , manager of @entity1 , has already beaten @entity50 outfit twice in the competition @entity0 led the @entity20 out at @entity52 in last season 's @entity21 semi-final defeat to @entity56 - @entity55 and @entity57 were beaten along the way - while this year @entity25 and @entity26 , in the @entity6 , and @entity59 , in the @entity21 , have all been despatched			1
when asked to account for the @entity20 ' imperious cup form , @entity0 added : " i have n't got a clue to be honest with you , but since the @entity55 game we 've embraced everything about the cups and these ties			2
" we 've gone out with no fear in them and produced some of our best performances in a long time			0
" the cup games have left people scratching their heads and asking why we ca n't replicate that form in the league			0
players celebrate after @entity0 scores the winning penalty in a penalty shoot out against @entity25 " in the league games we probably have the ball as much but we sit back and counter-attack in the cup games a bit more , whereas teams probably do that to us in the league			1
" it 's quite difficult to play against if you do it right			0
we 've found it difficult to play against at times , but we do it quite well ourselves , which we 've shown against the @entity50 teams			0
" we 're at the serious end of the cup now and probably nobody else will give us a chance , but our fans have seen the performances we 've put in and they 'll be expecting us to go down there and have a go			0
" centre - half @entity104 could go straight back into the starting line - up following his three - game ban , but midfielder @entity108 and @entity109 ( foot ) are not expected to be involved and @entity111 remains doubtful after missing saturday 's defeat at @entity113 due to an @entity115 problem			1
@entity111 ( right ) is a doubt for the game having missed saturday 's defeat by @entity113			2

club captain wants to bring the tie back to @entity18 very much alive
@entity1 beat @entity25 and @entity26 earlier in the *tournament*
@entity0 *tasted* defeat in semi-final against @entity56 last season
@entity111 , @entity109 and @entity108 could miss the game
