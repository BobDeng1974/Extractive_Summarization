@entity0 has called on @entity1 not to celebrate the centenary of the @entity3 but to focus on the idea that the @entity5 brought peace to the continent			1
the government in @entity9 recently sent a special envoy to the @entity1 amid fears that the way @entity1 marks the @entity3 could affect relations with @entity15 ’s administration			1
@entity16 called for talks with defence minister @entity18 as well as officials from the @entity20 and the @entity21 who are handling the commemorations , which start next year			2
a @entity0 envoy has voiced concerns over the commemorations taking place to mark the 100 - year anniversary of @entity3 the @entity0 envoy says it would be better to focus on the shared loss of all countries involved in the conflict @entity1 historians have called on the @entity1 government to acknowledge that the conflict was a just war to prevent @entity0 domination of @entity37 and to celebrate victory			1
but @entity39 , press attaché at the @entity0 embassy in @entity42 , said ‘ it would be easier ’ for @entity1 to adopt a ‘ less declamatory tone ’ if it wants @entity0 to take part			1
in an interview yesterday he said : ‘ we ca n’t tell you how you should celebrate , but our feeling is that issues about who was guilty and all that should be left more or less to historians and should n’t feature dominantly in politicians ’ speeches			2
‘ the biggest single contribution to the start of the @entity3 was @entity0 , but others played a part			1
whether it was a win or not , it was n’t worth it			2
‘ we would prefer not to have any celebrations , having lost			1
we do n’t want to commemorate the battles			2
we want to commemorate the dead			0
’ he said that commemorations on the continent would focus on the benefits of the @entity5			1
he said : ‘ the @entity37 idea is something that helped us overcome the situation where a war like this could start , where @entity37 countries could go to war with one another			2
‘ it may sound far - fetched here , but it does n’t elsewhere in @entity37			0
the @entity37 community will very much be part of the @entity0 commemoration			1
thankfully we have the @entity5			0
’ @entity80 , who sits on the @entity81 , denounced the idea that the @entity5 has kept peace since the @entity83 as ‘ outrageous ’ , since tensions over the eurozone have led to anti-german sentiment across the @entity5			0
he told the @entity87 : ‘ this attitude is unacceptable			0
the @entity0 might want to forget their history and pretend things did n’t happen , but we are not prepared to do that			1
‘ as for @entity37 being a cause of peace , this chap ’s obviously forgotten the reaction @entity15 got from the @entity96 the last time she went there			0
people dressed up in @entity100 uniforms , accusing her of completing @entity102 ’s work			0
‘ i do n’t think people in @entity96 are celebrating peace			0
the @entity5 seems to be having the opposite effect			0
’ @entity107 mp @entity106 , a historian who sits on the speaker ’s advisory committee on the war , told the @entity87 the events to mark the 100th anniversary should focus on why the war began and acknowledge the victors			1
he said : ‘ @entity3 still casts a shadow over modern @entity37 today			0
it ’s entirely right that we be respectful and commemorate the fallen from whichever side			0
but it would be a failure to history if we did n’t recognise not only the causes and consequences of the war , but that there were winning sides and losing sides			2
’ the @entity127 of historians , writers , religious leaders and retired military figures is the main body advising the government on commemorations			0
professor sir @entity135 of @entity136 , one of the panel members who has called for a greater emphasis on celebrations , said : ‘ i understand @entity0 ’s position			1
there is no virtue in offending @entity0			1
‘ but if we are going to be honest to the history of this war from a @entity1 perspective , then it ca n’t all be about waste and futility			1
a lot of people fought and died thinking it was worthwhile			0
we need to respect what those motivations were			0

envoy says remembrance , not victory , should be focus of anniversary
celebrations ' may affect relations between @entity0 and @entity1 '
but some @entity1 feel the *horror* of the war overshadows *heroism*
