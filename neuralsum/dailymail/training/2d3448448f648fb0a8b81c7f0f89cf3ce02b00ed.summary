by @entity1 reporter on the run : @entity3 , 48 , who invented a program that hacked into banking systems , was being hunted by police last night the mastermind behind a £ 7.5million credit card scam was being hunted last night			1
self - taught computer fraudster @entity3 , 48 , was sentenced to ten years in jail after going on the run in the middle of his fraud trial			1
he invented a program that hacked into banking systems so payments at @entity17 and in chip - and - pin machines could be reversed			1
this meant his gang could use cards repeatedly without exceeding their credit limits			1
most of the frauds were carried out at bureaux de change in @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28			0
the foreign currencies bought were then converted back into sterling			0
@entity31 ran the scam for nearly two years – raking in up to £ 50,000 a day – before it was smashed by police in 2010			1
yesterday , two of his accomplices were given suspended prison sentences at @entity38 for their part in the conspiracy			1
police believe @entity31 , who disappeared in december , could be living under a false name			1
the it expert , of @entity44 , @entity27 , carried out his latest scam after developing his computer and hacking skills through a friend who was attending @entity49			2
he had previously served a 32 - month jail term , imposed in 2006 , for attaching mp3 players to freestanding cash machines to record customers ' data so he could clone their cards			2
as customers ' bank details and pin numbers were punched in , the data from their cards as they were transmitted down a telephone line was illicitly recorded on to the @entity63 players			2
@entity31 then used software from the @entity65 to ' translate ' the tones from the transactions - before using the stolen data to clone new credit cards			1
the cards were then used by accomplices to buy £ 200,000 worth of goods in high street shops , the court heard			2
following his release from prison , @entity31 created a hacking computer programme called : ' the merchant dialler ' , which exploited a flaw in the ' chip and pin ' system where money could not be taken from a purchaser 's account for up to three days after a transaction			1
case : the self - taught computer fraudster was sentenced to ten years in jail at @entity38 usually a bank would ' earmark ' the money spent so cardholders would not exceed their limit , but @entity31 would wire up a laptop via a telephone to the targeted bank 's computer and hack in			1
this meant he could remove the earmark and enable the card to be used again			1
to rake in as much money as possible , @entity31 led an army of 100 ' shoppers ' who would buy genuine goods knowing he could ' reverse ' the transactions , the court heard			1
most transactions were carried out at bureau de changes , so purchased cash could be converted back into sterling			0
the scam was fully active between december 2008 and june 2009			2
@entity31 gave himself 50 per cent of all profits - with the rest being split between other gang members			1
he even encrypted his own software so his accomplices would not know how to use it and steal his secrets			0
mastermind : @entity31 , pictured outside court , ran the scam for nearly two years - raking in up to £ 50,000 a day - before it was smashed by police in 2010			1
detectives believe the it expert could be living under a false name @entity131 , prosecuting , told the court : ' there were serious concerns that the banking systems were under attack and that the problem may escalate			1
' it was something that had never happened before , in the @entity140 or worldwide , and the banks were not aware that this could actually happen to them			0
' this was not a complete reversal of the transaction , but the removal of the electronic earmark on the account			0
so the actual debit for the goods purchased would eventually accrue to the account			0
' the shopper then had the goods bought and also a card which could be used again and again for a period of up to three days			2
' as the actual debit would accrue up to three days later there was a limited life to the bank card that was being used and therefore a limit to how much any one card could obtain			2
' the more cards that could be used , the more money could be obtained			2
' @entity31 was caught when bosses at @entity164 , who were investigating the sudden losses of money , traced the landlines which were being used to infiltrate their computers			1
police were then able to raid three addresses in @entity27 and seized a number of computers which showed evidence of the computer programme			0
they also discovered recently purchased goods relating to the scam including a @entity179 , an @entity180 and a plasma television			0
@entity182 , judge @entity183 , said : ' this is a case which , very understandably , sent shockwaves through the banking industry			0
scam : @entity31 carried out his latest scam after serving a 32 - month jail term , imposed in 2006 , for attaching mp3 players to freestanding cash machines to record customers ' data so he could clone their cards ' it was a unique fraud and no other like it has been detected before or since			1
@entity3 created the device and developed the computer programme and he masterminded its execution and controlled everyone involved in it and i am sure had the technological know - how to carry out the fraud			1
' he is an articulate , intelligent , vociferous and very demanding individual , adept at the manipulation of those around him and he even manipulated members of his legal team			0
' @entity3 was the organiser and driving force behind this conspiracy			1
. without him i have no doubt it would not and could not have taken place			0
' he masterminded the entire enterprise from start to finish			0
he is a technically skilled , sophisticated computer fraudster			0
' @entity221 , 47 , of @entity222 , was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment , suspended for two years , and ordered to carry out 200 hours unpaid work after he admitted conspiracy and false accounting			1
his brother @entity227 , 44 , of @entity228 , @entity229 , also admitted conspiracy and will be sentenced later			0
meanwhile , @entity230 , 43 , of @entity231 , @entity232 , @entity27 , admitted conspiracy and was sentenced to 16 months imprisonment , suspended for two years			2
yesterday , detective constable @entity234 , of @entity235 said : ' this was a systematic , sophisticated and large - scale fraud where a number of people were able to effectively steal money quickly			0
' @entity31 is a prolific criminal who has deliberately been evasive with the authorities at every opportunity			2
throughout this investigation and the trial he has done all he can to delay this day			0
' he is a well - practiced , convincing and persuasive liar and can talk himself out of almost any situation			0
if you recognise this man then please do the right thing straight away and call the police			0
' since this conspiracy , the banks themselves have worked very hard to ensure that a similar scam could not happen again			0
