one of @entity1 's most famous ships , the @entity2 , was damaged by a mystery fire for the second time in recent years			1
however , the historic vessel was saved from destruction by the rapid response of firefighters who had developed emergency contingency plans following a devastating blaze seven years ago			1
flames damaged an area of the ship 's hull , although a ' swift and pre-planned ' response to the blaze meant firefighters were able to protect the national treasure			1
the ship , launched in 1869 , suffered millions of pounds worth of damage when a huge blaze ripped through its wooden hull during a £ 25 million restoration project in 2007			1
speaking at the scene last night , @entity33 station commander @entity32 said : ' @entity35 were called just before 7.30am by an automatic fire alarm system			0
' crews from @entity15 fire station responded quickly arriving on the scene within four minutes , at which point to officer in command called for assistance			1
the historic vessel was saved from destruction by the rapid response of firefighters ' within an hour a team of 20 firefighters had extinguished the blaze which damaged hull timbers			1
' he added : ' the crews worked swiftly to contain a fire which had broken out on level three , a floor below the top deck , which had started in one of the museum sections			2
' unfortunately a small area of the interior lining of the hull was damaged			2
we worked with the @entity2 conservation team to get the ship open to the public again at 10.30am , around half an hour after its scheduled opening time			2
' we have our investigation team on site working with engineers from the ship			0
having had a serious incident in the past there was a lot of pre-planning that goes into how we deal with situations like this			0
' the @entity2 is an important part of the @entity78 and they are very good with carrying out fire drills and fire safety checks			0
' visitors were allowed into the ship while fire investigators inspected the ship 's hull to establish the source of the blaze			1
teams could be seen abseiling down the port side of the ship looking for clues from the outside as to why the latest incident occurred			0
emergency services were called out to the fire in @entity15 at around 7.30am fire originally broke out on the @entity2 on may 21st , 2007 , causing £ 10 million worth of damage			1
luckily large sections of the ship , including the masts , saloon and deckhouses had been removed prior to the first blaze			1
by the time restoration was complete more than 90 per cent of the ship 's original features were still intact and the attraction reopened to the public in april 2012			1
the cause of the first devastating blaze was blamed on an industrial vacuum cleaner which had been left on for days			0
queuing to look around the boat this morning @entity113 tourist @entity112 , 35 , said : ' it 's a good job this thing did n't go up in flames again			2
' it 's so beautiful and had so much history attached to it			0
' @entity121 spokeswoman @entity120 said : ' at 7.21am this morning local fire crews responded rapidly to a fire alert on board @entity2			0
' this turned out to be a fire and the damage is very limited			2
the ship opened to the public half an hour later than normal			0
the cause of the fire is under investigation			0
