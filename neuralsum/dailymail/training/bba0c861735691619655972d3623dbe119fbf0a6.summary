prolific : @entity0 is continuously sharing pictures of meals out with followers on @entity4 it is a commonplace sight in @entity7 ’s high - end restaurants			1
a customer , delighted with their meal , photographs their plate of food and posts it on @entity4			1
the snapshots are sometimes labelled ‘ food porn ’ by their aficionados			1
but far from enjoying the free publicity , agitated @entity20 chefs have pledged to ban cameras in their restaurants , claiming it is the height of bad manners and an infringement of their ‘ intellectual property ’			1
a group of top chefs have criticised diners for ruining the surprise for future diners and tipping off rivals about their food presentation			1
chef @entity35 , 34 , who runs the @entity37 restaurant in @entity38 , in northern @entity20 , said diners often appeared more interested in photographing their food than eating it			1
he has now introduced menus with a picture of a camera with a line through it to dissuade diners from posting photos of their food on social networking sites			1
he said : ‘ they used to come and take pictures of themselves and their family , their grandmother , whoever , as a souvenir			2
' now they take pictures of the food , they put it on @entity61 or @entity4 , they comment			1
and then the food is cold			2
’ mr @entity35 said he had seen customers rearrange tables in order to capture their food at the best angle , before setting off a stream of flashes from their camera			2
he added : ‘ i would like people to be living in the present			0
tweet about the meal beforehand , tweet about it afterwards , but in between stop and eat			2
’ @entity76 , who runs a three @entity78 - starred restaurant , @entity80 du @entity79 , in @entity81 , in southern @entity20 , said : ‘ if people take a photo and put it out on social media , it takes away the surprise			1
@entity86 recently posed pictures of her meal to @entity89 - a practice which @entity20 chefs are trying to ban ‘ it takes away a little bit of my intellectual property too			1
‘ plus a photo taken on an average smartphone is rarely a great image			0
it does n’t give the best impression of our work			2
’ he complained that his signature dish ‘ @entity105 ’ , chicken egg laden with truffles , was now often pictured on social media			0
mr @entity76 said he wanted to ban the practice but did not want to appear rude himself			0
‘ it ’s difficult to forbid it			0
i ’m looking for a sentence to write but i have n’t yet found the right words that wo n’t be too shocking ’ , he said			0
several restaurants in @entity115 have already banned mobile phones for the same reason			0
@entity118 , head chef of the two @entity78 - starred @entity119 in @entity120 , central @entity121 , has also previously criticised the practice			0
he said : ‘ it should be flattering , but it annoys me when i see people taking photos of their food			1
‘ it ’s disruptive for the people around them and it spoils that person ’s enjoyment of the meal			0
personally , i think it ’s incredibly poor manners			0
’ one chef says he has seen diners move tables to take a picture , ruining the atmosphere for other diners but it seems not all @entity7 chefs agree with their @entity20 counterparts			1
@entity0 tweets pictures of her food non-stop , including when she is dining out			1
she previously took a photograph of herself at @entity149 ’s in @entity120 , writing : ‘ lunchtime treat at @entity149 ’s restaurant – oysters ! 3 @entity154 natives & 3 @entity156 natives			0
’ @entity149 ’s would later be the scene of her infamous contretemps with former husband @entity159			0
meanwhile , rapper professor @entity160 tweeted pictures of each of the courses of his £ 195 meal at the @entity165 while on a date with his now - wife , @entity167			2
his wife also regularly tweets about her food and posted a photograph of a fish dish at 202 @entity121 , in @entity172 , describing it as a ‘ dream ’			0
television presenter @entity174 is also a fan of food tweets , and posted a photo himself eating the ‘ sound of the sea ’ from the tasting menu at @entity179 ’s @entity165 restaurant in @entity180 , @entity181 , during a meal to celebrate his brother ’s birthday .			0

sharing pictures of food *online* is an established trend
however @entity20 chefs are now trying to stop diners taking snaps
they claim it ruins the atmosphere and could give away their *secrets*
