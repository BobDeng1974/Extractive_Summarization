do you know two people who are just perfect for each other ? well , now there 's an app for that			2
hitch , is being touted as the @entity6 for matchmakers , as it lets people set up two @entity11 friends			1
named after the @entity15 film about a romantic guru who helps singles find love , the idea for the app was inspired after founder @entity19 met a mutual friend one night but felt too bashful to ask his chums for her number			1
although singles are set up with each other anonymously initially , matchmakers can see how many messages the pair have exchanged once they 've chosen to reveal their identities			1
the idea for the app all stemmed from a thwarted encounter			1
founder @entity19 , from @entity46 , said : ' in february last year i went to a gig with a group of friends			1
there was a girl in the group that i had n’t met before who was a friend of a friend			0
' she did n’t stay for very long and left , so i did n’t get a chance to talk to her			0
' the next day i was sitting at home , thinking how could i get in touch with her			0
short of asking our mutual friend for her number and being like “ hey , i ’m that guy at the gig last night , i ’d like to take you out ” , i had nothing			0
hitch founder @entity19 says the idea behind the app was simple : ' i was single			1
i made an app. ' and it 's not only been a professional success for @entity19 , but a romantic one too to create a hitch , you log in through @entity11 and select two friends you want to introduce			1
the pair do not need to have the app installed to be selected - you can invite them later			2
' i checked online and there was no app that i could use to get an introduction			0
' and since that night , he 's used his creation to improve his own love life			0
he said : ' by the time the app was out , that girl from the gig was dating someone			1
but my friend introduced me to someone else			0
she is incredible and we are dating now			0
' hitch is available in 50 countries and around 2,000 hitches are made in the @entity97 each month			1
@entity19 said : ' we grew very quickly in @entity98			2
matchmaking is popular in their culture , people understand the concept straight away and tell their friends about it			0
there is also huge potential in markets where online dating is difficult			0
' he said that because matches are being made through pools of mutual friends , it narrows down choices and feels reliable as friends are making the introductions			0
mr @entity19 says the ' pick - up line ' is always the same			2
having a mutual friend makes communication very easy , meaning that 85 per cent of hitches result in conversation friends know better : hitch is available to download in 50 countries , and users have increased particularly quickly in @entity98 , where matchmaking is a popular culture he added that women are better matchmakers than men			1
' there ’s a lady in @entity134 , she has introduced 14 couples on @entity123			0
she ’s really good at this ! recruitment consultant @entity137 , 22 , from @entity46 , is currently using hitch but needs more friends to download it before he can see it transforming his love life			2
he said : ' i liked the idea of both setting up my friends and being set up anonymously			1
i downloaded the app , but the issue is , you have to have a lot of friends on there for it to work			2
' @entity19 says he hopes awareness of @entity123 will continue to grow			2
he said : ' we think that people that are successful , will in turn tell their friends how they met and introduce them			0
' @entity137 , 22 , says he likes the idea of @entity123 , but points to the fact that it relies on many of your friends having the app too			1

hitch app lets you set up two of your friends through @entity11
chat begins anonymously , but pairs can choose to reveal their identity
over 85 per cent of hitches result in conversation and many lead to dating
founder @entity19 says the idea came from his own experiences
