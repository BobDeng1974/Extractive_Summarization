just over a month ago , @entity0 sat down with @entity2 ’s inner circle to discuss the club ’s targets for the january transfer window			1
it was a short meeting			0
@entity7 was content , delighted with his club ’s climb up the table after their failure to register a victory in the @entity13 until they beat @entity15 on october 18			0
but @entity0 , who was named @entity17 manager of the year in 2012 after guiding @entity2 to fifth and the @entity18 , is an ambitious man			1
@entity2 boss @entity0 is expected to be imminently appointed as @entity20 's new manager @entity0 masterminded @entity2 to a 3 - 2 @entity13 home win against @entity22 on sunday @entity0 applauds the home crowd after their victory at @entity26 against the @entity22 @entity0 becomes new @entity20 boss as @entity2 thrash out £ 2million compensation deal with @entity20 @entity29 says @entity0 's move makes sense - he is going somewhere he is loved @entity32 believes @entity20 will never be as big a club as @entity2 so there must have been a good reason for @entity0 to walk any manager looking to send their cv for the @entity40 job must beware @entity41 would jump at the opportunity to manage his boyhood club @entity44 believes @entity2 must appoint a @entity45 as their next manager he wanted to add quality to the team , attracting players with pedigree to @entity26 in order to have a genuine crack at getting back into the top four			1
@entity7 was having none of it			0
as @entity0 prepares to start work at @entity20 , his biggest beef with his former employers at @entity2 is that he did not get to choose the players			1
instead they are scouted by @entity61 and deposited at their @entity63 training ground for @entity0 to use as he sees fit			2
last summer , for example , a young @entity66 striker by the name of @entity68 arrived on loan from @entity71 for the season			0
@entity68 , 23 , has yet to play and on monday one source at the club described him as one of the worst players ever seen at this level			0
two more signings , @entity80 and @entity81 , arrived in the summer and were immediately sent on loan to @entity83 before @entity0 could even assess them			2
as the transfer window approaches , @entity0 fears @entity86 , one of the club ’s best players , will be picked off by @entity89 or @entity90			1
last year , after influential midfielder @entity92 was sold to @entity90 for £ 19m on january 29 , they lost 11 of their last 14 games in the @entity13			2
he was wary of a repeat should @entity86 be sold			0
on loan striker @entity68 is yet to feature this season since joining from @entity71 the 23 - year - old has been describes as one of the worst players ever seen at this level by one source @entity40 lost 11 of their last 14 games in the @entity13 last term after selling @entity92 ( left ) to @entity90 @entity92 was sold to the @entity105 giants for £ 19million in the 2014 january transfer window @entity86 could leave in january after @entity89 and @entity90 declared an interest @entity2 ’s manager wants a real input into the teams he sends out in front of some of the most demanding supporters in the country , many of whom have never accepted him			1
his appointment reportedly received the backing of only five per cent of fans in a poll at the time , while the @entity121 and @entity123 campaigns hurt him more than he will ever let on			0
now is the time to make a clean break			0
on monday the manager was at his family home in @entity128 , waiting for @entity7 to respond from his holiday home in @entity130 before he could return home for good			0
despite the tensions at @entity26 , particularly over transfer strategy , @entity0 has an excellent relationship with @entity7			2
he appreciated the owner ’s support during their bleak start to the season and was taken by surprise when @entity7 made an impromptu visit to the dressing room after that win against @entity15			0
@entity2 fans hold up a ' @entity0 is a muppet ' banner ahead of their team 's @entity147 vs @entity149 in april the @entity2 fans wanted @entity0 out after a difficult start to the 2014 - 15 @entity13 campaign the @entity121 became an infamous protest many unhappy @entity2 supporters this season @entity2 fans portray @entity0 as @entity154 during their clash at @entity149 in september now that he has found a way out of the complex eight - year @entity2 contract he signed in september 2012 , @entity0 will have the backing of @entity20 ’s four owners			1
although @entity161 , @entity162 , @entity163 and @entity164 are equal shareholders , @entity160 is the most prominent			0
undoubtedly , though , the appointment of @entity0 will meet with the approval of all four			2
to them it will feel as though he is coming home			0
@entity0 served @entity20 with distinction in the @entity172 and very early @entity173 , scoring the winner in the @entity176 semi-final against @entity177 in april 1990			1
there is an emotional pull for @entity0 , who came through a difficult start to his career at @entity182			1
@entity183 , now the club ’s official ambassador and a sounding board for @entity160 , knows @entity0 well from his own playing days at @entity20 and will make sure he settles quickly			1
@entity0 played more than 100 games for @entity20 during a four - year spell at the south @entity190 club @entity0 ( no 11 ) scores the winning goal for @entity20 in the 1990 @entity176 semi-final against @entity177 setting aside the size of @entity2 and the 52,000 supporters who watch the team each week at @entity26 , @entity0 and @entity20 appear to be a good fit			1
since the @entity20 takeover in 2010 , @entity0 has been on friendly terms with @entity160 and he is a regular guest in the boardroom when he watches games at @entity182			1
parish has been tempted to appoint him on several occasions and he was under consideration again before plumping for @entity205 in august			2
after @entity205 was sacked following the 3 - 1 defeat against @entity208 on @entity209 , the deal for @entity0 began to fall into place			1
since then , @entity7 has been negotiating @entity0 ’s release from his sun lounger in the @entity213			2
@entity7 is wary of the upheaval , the inevitable change in atmosphere at a club after a manager leaves on his own terms instead of the owner ’s			0
it is an unusual situation			0
@entity0 , who has spent four years at @entity2 , leaves a team ninth in the @entity13 table for one fighting against relegation with 19 games left of the season			1
his brief is to keep the team in the division , to build on the brilliant work of @entity232			0
but now that he is back in south @entity190 , the signings must be all down to him			0
@entity232 ( centre ) worked wonders at @entity20 , and it is now up to @entity0 to continue his good work @entity20 are stepping up their search to replace former boss @entity205 and have earmarked @entity0 @entity2 owner @entity7 , who is currently in @entity130 , will have the final say on @entity0 's future @entity7 has agreed to reach a compromise with @entity20 chief @entity161 rather than demand the full £ 5m			1

@entity2 boss @entity0 is expected to take over at @entity20
@entity0 will sign four - year deal worth up to £ 2m a year at @entity182
@entity205 was sacked as @entity20 boss following their 3 - 1 @entity249 home defeat by @entity208
@entity0 has been *undermined* in his transfer policy dealings at @entity2
the *53* - year - old has been the target of abuse from own fans this season
@entity0 played for @entity20 from 1987 until 1991
