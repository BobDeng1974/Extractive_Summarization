@entity0 need to sign @entity2 's @entity1 in january if they want to win the @entity3 this season , according to former midfielder @entity5			1
@entity5 knows what it takes to win the title having won the @entity3 twice during his time with the @entity10			1
and the @entity11 – who has just signed for @entity12 in the newly formed @entity13 – believes @entity0 boss @entity14 needs a dominant midfielder			1
@entity1 could be the ideal signing for @entity0 , according to former midfielder @entity5 @entity1 helped @entity17 win the @entity18 in @entity19 this summer @entity5 told @entity20 : ‘ he [ @entity14 ] needs a big player in the middle , like ( @entity24 ) @entity23 , strong , tall , because this position is very important for the balance between attack and defence			1
‘ the quality is there but you need more , maybe [ someone ] like @entity34			0
he reminds me of @entity23 , maybe they have an opportunity with @entity1			2
‘ it is likely in the january window			0
he played very well with @entity17			0
my advice is if he can buy @entity1 he can be the [ new ] @entity23 , more aggression in the middle			0
@entity5 ( 2nd left ) played for @entity0 with @entity23 ( left ) when they last won the title back in 2004 ‘ he has a lot of experience			1
when you play in the middle you need experience , especially when your midfield is young like @entity0 's			2
’ @entity1 's contract at @entity2 runs out next year and @entity0 could snap up the @entity18 winner for around £ 10million in january			1
@entity0 have not won the @entity3 since 2003 - 04 when @entity5 was part of the side that went the whole season unbeaten			2
@entity14 ’s side are currently eighth in the table after seven games and are nine points behind leaders @entity60			0
