i had escaped from the killing and was without injury so i made use of a smoke cloud to slip behind the altar			0
in this part of the church there are three windows			0
i made for the widest one in the middle and with the help of a stool used to light the candles , i tried to reach it			0
i do n't know how but my strength was multiplied			0
