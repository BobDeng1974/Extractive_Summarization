the flagship @entity1 website continued to spout error messages on monday , hobbling a new fix that the @entity4 bragged would avoid system crashes caused by too much web traffic			1
frustrated with news reports about crashes , delays and other online failures , the @entity9 administration 's ' tech surge ' team put in place an email - driven ' queuing system ' similar to the overdraft feature available with some checking accounts			1
when the site 's traffic exceeds its capacity , subsequent users see a message asking for their email addresses			1
' ca n't wait ? ' the message reads			0
' leave your email with us , and we 'll send you a one - time message when @entity29 is ready for you to return			2
' this page , too , was prone to crash on monday , at the very moment @entity4 press secretary @entity32 was boasting about it to reporters			2
' sorry , there was an error ! ' it read			0
' please reload and try again later			0
' the @entity54 said monday during a conference call with reporters that the queueing system was put in place at 10:00 monday morning			2
during his daily press briefing on monday , @entity32 cautioned reporters to draw a distinction between error messages and the queueing system – which he styled as a life - saving feature , not a bug unto itself			1
@entity67 , said @entity69 correspondent @entity68 , ' are still getting the same error messages they got three weeks ago			0
' not so , said @entity32			0
' i think you 're confusing error messages with the queueing message , which is quite a different thing entirely , ' he claimed			0
' the queuing system , ' @entity32 had said earlier in the briefing , ' is a feature designed to improve the user experience			1
' @entity4 press secretary @entity32 insisted that the ' queueing feature ' -- a sort of overdraft protection for website registrations -- was a helpful new feature , but it crashed whiel he was praising its virtues he told reporters that through 12:00 noon , healthcare.gov had been visited 375,000 times since midnight monday			1
the @entity54 has said that it hoped to have the capacity to serve as many as 800,000 visitors per day			0
only a fraction of those visitors are expected to create healthcare.gov accounts , apply for coverage , or actually purchase insurance policies			2
@entity32 's remarks , and the latest round of website failures , came on cyber monday , an unofficial shopping holiday when @entity99 expected to sell 27 million items to 13 million customers			1
he also reinforced the @entity4 's earlier promises , going back to early in 2010 , that president @entity9 himself would sign up for @entity1 coverage			1
' he will , ' @entity32 confirmed			0
the move would be largely symbolic , however , since a private staff of military doctors cares for the @entity9 family .			0

government *programmers* designed a ' queueing ' feature to help avoid system crashes , emailing users to return when traffic levels are lower
that new add - on , too , crashed on monday while president @entity9 's chief *spokesman* was boasting that it would ' improve the user experience '
