by @entity0 if you think seeing a rocket launch from @entity3 is impressive , then take a look at these onboard views from @entity6			0
the @entity8 rocket , which deployed @entity9 to into orbit , provided the world with a front - row seat in space last week			1
recorded last week during its 23 - minute mission from @entity16 - an overseas region of @entity17 on the @entity20 coast - multiple cameras covered the action from final countdown to separation of the mission ’s payload			1
the video begins with the pre-launch steps as seen from two cameras - mounted on opposite sides of the medium - lift launcher			0
as the rocket emerges from the clouds and through the planet ’s atmosphere , the @entity6 ’s first stage boosters are ejected and make a fiery fall to @entity3			0
liftoff : the @entity8 rocket , which deployed @entity9 to into orbit , provided the world with a front - row seat in space			1
it is pictured here on the launch pad in from the @entity54 in @entity16 up and away : as seen by two downward - looking cameras on opposite sides of @entity6 , the launcher begins its ascent through the clouds and away from @entity3 's atmosphere @entity61 is a polar - orbiting , all - weather , day - and - night radar imaging mission for land and ocean services			2
the first @entity61 - 1 satellite was launched on a @entity6 rocket from @entity68 's @entity54 in @entity16 on 3 april 2014			0
the satellite will form the core of @entity68 ’s @entity71 environmental monitoring network			1
@entity71 will provide operational information on the world ’s land surfaces , oceans and atmosphere to support environmental and security policy making			1
after a 617 second burn , @entity9 was separated at around 434 miles ( 700km ) above the @entity3 to begin its life in orbit			0
the satellite ’s solar panels and antenna were then deployed in a complex sequence that took around 11 hours			0
flight @entity6 was @entity8 ’s seventh mission from @entity16 , and its @entity9 passenger will form the core of @entity68 ’s @entity71 environmental monitoring network			1
@entity71 will provide data on the world ’s land surfaces , oceans and atmosphere to support environmental and security policy decisions in @entity68			1
‘ the launch of the first @entity61 - 1 satellite marks a change in philosophy for our @entity3 observation programmes , ’ said @entity92 , @entity94 ’s director of earth observation programmes			2
‘ in meteorology , satellites have been providing reliable data for weather forecasts for over 35 years			0
‘ with the @entity71 programme , we will now have a similar information source for environmental services as well as for applications in the security and disaster management domain			2
’ ejection : a payload fairing - the nose cone used to protect a spacecraft - is separated from the rocket fiery fall : the rocket 's second state and the upper assembly are discarded as the rocket gains momentum final destination : @entity61 is a polar - orbiting , all - weather , day - and - night radar imaging mission for land and ocean services			2
it is pictured her just after the rocket released it into orbit			0

the *footage* was recorded last week during the rocket 's 23 - minute mission
highlights include separation and ejection of the rocket ’s rear section
@entity141 deployed @entity9 into orbit to form @entity94 ’s @entity71 network
the network will provide environmental monitoring services gathering data on the world ’s land surfaces , oceans and atmosphere
