by @entity0 published : 14:05 est , 4 november 2012 updated : 02:24 est , 6 november 2012 this is the tragic two - year - old boy who was mauled to death by a pack of ravenous @entity6 wild dogs after he fell off a zoo railing his mother put him on to get a better view of the animals on sunday			1
@entity11 had ' no chance ' of surviving after falling 11 feet into the dog pit at the @entity14 while his horrified parents @entity15 and @entity16 looked on helpless			1
desperate rescue attempts by zookeepers and armed police officers could not deter the 11 aggressive beasts as they savagely attacked the two - year - old , from @entity23 , on sunday morning			1
a medical examiner concluded today that the toddler was killed by the animals , not by the fall			1
he bounced off the net , which is there to save small items like cameras and phones @entity57 , ceo and president of the @entity14 and @entity14 said there is a net below the rail , but the boy bounced off it and into the enclosure			1
she said the animals attacked the child so quickly that by the time a veterinarian and other zoo staffers arrived seconds later , they determined it would have been futile to try to rescue the child			2
authorities said that zoo staff and then police responded ' within minutes ' but visitors described that time as being filled with screams for help			1
zookeepers called off some of the dogs , and seven of them immediately went to a back building			1
the @entity6 wild dog is an endangered species which typically roams the open plains and sparse woodlands of @entity85			1
the dog 's latin name @entity86 means ' painted wolf ' because of the animal 's patchy colored coat of red , black , brown , white and yellow fur , each with their own unique pattern			1
these dogs are very social , and packs have been known to share food and to assist weak or ill members			1
in fact after a successful hunt , the dogs regurgitate meat for those that remained at the den. they hunt in packs of six to 20 and despite their small size they prey on large animals like antelopes and wildebeests			1
they kill the larger prey by disemboweling , a technique that is rapid but has caused this species to have a negative , ferocious reputation			2
they are often hunted and killed by farmers who fear for their domestic animals and are susceptible to diseases spread by domestic animals			1
its large teeth allow it to consume a lot of bone in the same way a hyena does and it has a bite force quotient - @entity131 , the strength of bite relative to the animal 's mass - measured at 142 , the highest of any carnivore , except for the @entity135			2
they are extremely aggressive and nearly 80 per cent of their hunts end in a kill - as opposed to a lion with a success rate of just 30 percent			2
there were once approximately 500,000 @entity6 wild dogs in 39 countries , and packs of 100 or more were not uncommon			1
now there are only about 3,000 - 5,500 in fewer than 25 countries three more eventually were drawn away from the child and one especially aggressive dog refused to back down and stop attacking the boy			1
it was shot dead by an officer			1
experts said the death is highly unusual			2
the family 's neighbor @entity155 told the @entity157 : ' ( @entity15 and @entity16 ) went nowhere without @entity11			1
i can not imagine the dark cloud that is following them			0
' ' i ca nâ€™t imagine as a mom myself what tragedy that would be , your heart stops when your kid skins a knee			0
' she said her father saw @entity11 trick - or - treating in a @entity172 costume , and he could often be found playing on a swing set with his cousin , who lives nearby			1
' the hardest part is going to be to explain to my kids that their playmate is no longer here			0
his life will be celebrated			0
' @entity179 , a spokesman for the @entity180 , said no one he 's spoken to can recall any deaths of children at an accredited zoo over the last 40 years or more			0
@entity179 said the @entity14 successfully completed its five - year review in september , which means it meets or exceeds all safety standards			1
the zoo was immediately closed , and it was not clear when it will reopen , authorities said			0
the so - called painted dogs are about as big as medium - sized domestic dogs , and 37 to 80 pounds , according to the zoo			1
they have large , rounded ears and dark brown circles around their eyes and are considered endangered			0
the attack happened in a 1.5 acre exhibit called the @entity196 that 's part of a larger open area where elephants , lions and other animals can be seen			0
visitors walk onto a deck that is glassed on the sides , but open in front where the roughly four - foot railing is located			1
in may , some of the dogs crawled under a fence and escaped into a part of the exhibit that 's usually closed			2
the zoo was on lockdown for about an hour as a precaution			0
@entity214 said there was nothing to prevent visitors to the painted dog exhibit from jumping into the exhibit area			2
he described the accident as ' horrific '			0
' unfortunately , the dogs were in pack mentality and not responding to zookeepers ' efforts to control them , ' the zoo said in a statement			1
police and the @entity230 medical examiner 's office are investigating , and they have n't yet interviewed the mother or father , who are receiving grief counseling			2
@entity57 said the zoo , which has never had a visitor death , will also investigate			0
she said no decision has been made yet on the future of the exhibit			0
emergency : now closed , the @entity14 's entrance is seen after the young boy was killed after falling into the exhibit around noon lock - dock : the zoo immediately closed and patrons were hurried inside buildings during the attack deadly : the dogs , which are smaller than @entity248 , can be dangerous on their own by are deadly killers when hunting in packs zoo officials said there is a mesh barrier beyond the railing , but lt @entity214 said it was designed to catch small objects such as cameras , and not humans			1
investigators have not determined the exact cause of death , he said			0
' the screams just kept coming and coming : " someone help			0
someone has to do something , '' ' witness @entity267 , 20 , who was visiting the zoowith her boyfriend told the @entity269			0
' we were on our way to the polar bear exhibit when we heard the most horrible piercing screams , ' ms @entity270 recalled			0
' someone was begging for help , asking someone to do something			0
' guests recounted being hurried into the nearest building for safety , waiting for a half an hour according to ms @entity284			0
' we were locked down in the building and told to stay inside , ' ms @entity284 told the paper			0
' we thought it was a problem with one of the animals that got loose			0
then we were told it was an incident with the wild dogs and that a child had been hurt			2
' uncertainty : a security guard closes the gate to the park though it 's not yet clear whether he died from the fall or the attack reaction : the boy was pronounced dead at the scene as guests were hurried into the nearest buildings as a safety precaution , ushered under zoo officials like ms @entity57 , pictured in may , 200 patrons were rushed inside buildings and the zoo was put on lock - down when nine of the dogs sneaked out of the exhibit and found its way into a secondary holding pen			1
alone , the dogs , which weigh up to 80 pounds , can be formidable , but in packs they are vicious -- capable of hunting and killing prey many times their size			2
they have been known to kill wildebeest and zebras , though they usually pursue less dangerous prey			0
the dogs , which are endangered , are among the most deadly predators of the @entity326			2
their hunts end in a kill 80 per cent of the time			0
lions have a success rate of just 30 per cent			0
unfortunately your browser does not support @entity335 .			0
