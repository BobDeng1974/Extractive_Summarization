by @entity0 published : 21:01 est , 21 november 2013 @entity2 : 14:37 est , 22 november 2013 while the tragic death of a president was about to kickstart @entity7 ’s impressive career , the then 32 - year - old managed to find @entity8 and his film but could n’t quite get his hands on it for @entity12			1
‘ this is not a time when everyone has a camera , ’ @entity7 told @entity13 in an interview for @entity15			2
‘ not everyone has a motion picture camera			0
’ as the first journalist to report @entity24 ’s assassination , @entity7 is in a unique position to recount the terrible tale now , at the event ’s 50 year anniversary			2
he recalls thinking , ‘ the president is dead in front of thousands of people			0
’ the race was on to become the first news organization to get footage of the president ’s death			2
‘ we started making phone calls , ’ @entity7 said , and within hours the @entity12 @entity32 staff learned of a private citizen who had a camera			1
‘ keep in mind , not many people had movie cameras			0
’ miraculously , @entity7 says his team was able to track down @entity8 , a local businessman who took with him to the presidential motorcade his 8mm @entity65 camera			1

breaking it to the nation : rather shot to national prominence not long after becoming the first to report to the nation the startling details of @entity33 's assassination in 1963 iconic : @entity32 sportswear manufacturer @entity8 ( right ) took the 1963 the motion picture footage that has now become synonymous with the president 's assassination near miss : @entity8 nearly left his 8mm zoomatic that day , but his secretary insisted he take it despite the overcast skies			1
he later sold the footage he took for $ 150,000 to @entity85 ‘ by the next morning , mr. @entity8 , quite wisely , had a lawyer , ’ @entity7 said			1
here , @entity7 leaves out a juicy part of the tale in his discussion with @entity13 that his national producer @entity90 does not gloss over in his own recounting			2
reports @entity92 : ‘ in my desire to get a hold of what was probably the most dramatic piece of news footage ever shot , ’ @entity90 said , ‘ i told rather to go to @entity8 ’s house , sock him in the jaw , take his film to our affiliate in @entity32 , copy it onto videotape , and let the @entity12 lawyers decide whether it could be sold or whether it was in the public domain			1
’ in @entity110 ’s telling , @entity7 agreed that , yes , punching @entity8 and stealing the tape was the best idea			1
but the producer quickly had a change of heart			0
‘ i had n’t hung up the phone maybe ten seconds when it hit me : what in the hell did you just do ? are you out of your mind ? so i called @entity7 back			2
luckily , he was still there			0
’ instead of getting physical , @entity7 showed up to @entity8 ’s attorney ’s office to broker a deal to get the film			1
but he was n’t the only newsman on the case			0
still , to this day : much of what the world saw in the media from that november day in @entity130 was in still photos like this			0
that 's partially because @entity7 and @entity12 were outbid for the motion footage by a print magazine , life vantage : this recreation of the assassination from 1997 shows a similar vantage point to the one @entity8 got in 1963			1
he was unique for the close vantage and also for having a motion camera in an era when they were relatively rare watch @entity7 report to the world what he saw in @entity8 's footage ... ‘ i thought that we had the only access to mr. @entity8 , ’ @entity7 said			1
however , ‘ @entity151 — a great reporter — at @entity85 at that time … a tough reporter working for an outfit with deep pockets			1
i hated to see him there			0
’ @entity7 was told he could watch the footage once before making his bid for the film			1
‘ i ’ll never forget being in that room			0
my head was back , my eyes were wide , my mouth was agape			0
’ - @entity7 , on the moment he first watched the @entity166 footage ‘ i ’ll never forget being in that room , ’ he said			2
‘ my head was back , my eyes were wide , my mouth was agape			0
’ @entity7 was given the okay by his higher ups to pay at most $ 50,000 for the soon - to - be famous film			2
but when he went to make his first offer , @entity8 ’s attorney said the film had been sold			2
@entity151 and @entity173 had paid $ 150,000 — what would be a million dollars today — for the film and stolen it right out from under @entity7 ’s nose			1
nonetheless , @entity7 would go down in history as the first to report @entity33 ’s death and his black and white likeness has become synonymous with the terrible moment in @entity182			1
moments to live : many still photos were taken and the first thing rather and his @entity12 team looked for were shots of the moment @entity33 was killed			0
when he learned of motion footage and was then able to track it down , he jumped at the chance to buy it burned into his memory : ' i ¿ ll never forget being in that room			0
my head was back , my eyes were wide , my mouth was agape			0

in the days before phone cameras , sportswear manufacturer @entity8 happened to be recording the president 's 1963 @entity32 motorcade with his new 8mm camera
following the assassination , the *top* @entity182 news outlets scrambled to track down footage of the president 's murder
a young @entity7 and @entity12 found @entity8 and nearly *snagged* the *exclusive* film before @entity85 's @entity151 outbid him
