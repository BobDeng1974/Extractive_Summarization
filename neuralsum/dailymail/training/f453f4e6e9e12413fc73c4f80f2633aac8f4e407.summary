by @entity0 published : 16:00 est , 24 august 2013 updated : 07:44 est , 25 august 2013 looking for a change : @entity0 had a 3d body scan that showed him what the results of liposuction would look like - and booked one when buying a car , you take it for a test drive			1
when purchasing a suit , it ’s usual to try it on			1
i even taste grapes in @entity14 before buying a bunch			1
but when it comes to a far more life - changing decision – cosmetic surgery – the same ca n’t be applied			1
nose or boob - jobs , liposuction , tummy tucks – most patients undergo these operations without knowing the exact outcome			1
yes , the surgeon will talk through the options , and show you before and after pictures of other patients			1
but it ’s a leap in the dark			1
no one can predict how the body will react or how a patient will look afterwards			1
so a new state - of - the - art @entity38 programme is being heralded as a solution since it shows patients what they ’ll look like post- op. the equipment consists of eight cameras mounted on four outstretching arms			1
it takes a set of high - resolution images when you stand , naked , in front of it			1
the software then merges the images into a @entity38 template to be viewed on a computer monitor			1
you can view up to six simulations at one time and compare them side by side , or rotate them and view them at any angle			1
it makes sense – choosing the wrong nose is rather more devastating than picking up a shirt that does n’t fit			1
i should point out i ’m not actually interested in surgery myself – or at least , i was n’t			1
despite being 40 this year and no @entity69 , i ’ve always been pretty happy with the way i look			2
but in the name of journalism , i agree to have the 3d imaging process with @entity75 cosmetic surgeon @entity74			1
his clinic is one of a handful in the @entity80 with the equipment			2
‘ this is an ideal way to give patients a realistic grasp of what they can expect from any procedure , ’ he says			1
‘ women , for example , come to me asking for breast implants and want big , f - size cups			2
; when they see the 3d image of themselves with this size , they usually realise it ’s not really what they are looking for			2
we can then adjust the breast size on the image to a size they can see looks correct on them			2
‘ the 3d image also helps me plan the procedure			2
i can obtain measurements and details from the software and then create a really accurate plan of how to operate			2
’ dr @entity74 offers to show me how i can look thanks to the @entity113 software			1
i strip to my underwear and stand in front of the giant clam - like device			2
when i see my unaltered 3d image on the monitor , my jaw drops ; i look hideous			2
is that what people see when they look at me ? i cringe as dr @entity74 rotates my bulging belly 360 degrees			2
we also look at my face , which displays the signs of late nights , early mornings , alcohol abuse and sunbathing			2
i ask to ‘ try on ’ some facial procedures			0
with the click of a mouse , dr @entity74 shows how i ’d look with a botoxed ‘ brow - lift ’ , a reduction in my deep - set nasal labial lines with dermal filler and frown lines on my forehead erased			0
i feel strange looking at this ‘ airbrushed ’ version of myself			0
i suspect i look feminised			0
i ’m keen to banish my pot belly ; can the computer erase it ? the doctor examines my midriff in the flesh , noting that ‘ it looks an unusual shape ’			0
i can certainly ‘ pinch an inch ’ and he also comments that my stomach muscles are stretched and elongated rather than solid and tight			0
he says if i could only shift that inch , i ’d have that @entity151 of male beauty – a six - pack			0
what to expect : the 3d scans can show you what you will look like after surgery - minimizing risk of unpleasant surprises we talk about @entity160 to pump up my core strength as well as the method dr @entity74 uses to suck fat out from around the abs to give them definition			1
it is a form of liposuction called @entity169			0
the fat is sucked out with a tiny cannula through a small incision , then the skin is tightened with a laser			0
gym - lovers starve and dehydrate themselves to achieve this look , whereas i ’m presented with the chance to have it after just three weeks of @entity160 and a two - hour operation			0
dr @entity74 shows in @entity38 what would happen			1
it ’s the flat stomach i used to have in my 20s			0
of course , this is merely a computer - generated picture			0
as @entity184 , from the surgery advice website @entity186 , explains : ‘ this is n’t an exact science ; it ’s an artistic interpretation , similar to a flattering portrait			1
' surgery is unpredictable , with potential complications			1
for example , high - frequency ultrasound liposuction has a risk of burns to the skin and contour irregularities – lumpy skin , to you and me			0
however , 3d imaging is a useful tool for giving the patient a realistic idea of what can be achieved			1
’ my digitally flattened stomach is definitely appealing			0
i would never want to be 20 again , but the prospect of getting back my abs is tempting			0
although no one would say i ’m fat , i ’m aware i ’m breathing in more on the beach and that there ’s no room for manoeuvre in my jeans			0
what ’s more amazing is that the computer also tells dr @entity74 that when it flattened my stomach , it removed 300ml of fat			0
my mind races : 300ml is about a can of @entity223 ’s worth – it ’s nothing ! ‘ how difficult an operation can that be ? ’ i think			0
suddenly my brain makes a leap from ‘ a flat stomach is a nice idea ’ to ‘ 300ml is nothing – that ’ll be easy – get it done ! ask for it now ! ’ is this what @entity232 felt like every time he visited a cosmetic clinic ? i ’m ready to take the next step in a heartbeat			0
i book a @entity169 treatment there and then			0
it ’s only on the train home that i wonder : ‘ have i just let a piece of technology sell me an £ 8,000 cosmetic operation ? ’ probably			0
but seeing really is believing			0

@entity38 imaging programmes show patients what they will look like post-op
eight cameras capture all angles of a body before ' surgery ' is applied
