by @entity0 published : 11:32 est , 29 january 2013 updated : 14:25 est , 29 january 2013 @entity1 wanted his huge stash of adult pornography returned a porn addict found with paedophile images in a massive collection seized by officers in a raid took police to court - in a failed bid to get it all back			1
disabled @entity1 , 59 , downloaded so much adult material it would have taken more than a month of non-stop viewing to watch it all			1
he also had tens of thousands of photographs - including 11 indecent ones of eight girls and three boys			0
police arrested him three times on suspicion of possessing indecent child photos and seized six pcs and laptops from his home in @entity26 , @entity27			2
but he escaped prosecution when experts revealed the child images had probably been ' unwittingly ' downloaded as the adult porn was automatically sent to his computers			1
they said they were found on parts of the computers that four - times married mr @entity1 could not have accessed without specialist tools or techniques			1
police returned two of the computers - but retained those containing the child pornography			1
they took mr @entity1 to court for the forfeiture and destruction of the hard drives they had kept which had a massive @entity47 of adult movies and @entity49 of adult photos			1
a district judge found in the police 's favour last july , saying they could not return hard drives containing child porn because they would be distributing illegal material			2
mr @entity1 appealed , claiming they could delete or transfer the child images and return his huge stash of adult pornography			1
the former lorry driver claimed : ' i 'm not interested in child porn			1
i do n't think it 's fair they are keeping my computers when i have n't done anything illegal			2
the father downloaded so much adult material it would have taken more than a month of non-stop viewing to watch it all ' i paid £ 40 for a month 's subscription to a website and i was downloading films from it day and night			1
i wanted to get my money 's worth			0
' they cost me a couple of thousand pounds in total			0
every time the police took two computers away , i would buy another two			0
' mr @entity1 , who is estranged from his son , added : ' the good thing about having a computer is you can switch it off when you 've finished - you ca n't switch off a wife			1
' but his appeal was rejected by judge @entity91 , sitting with magistrates @entity92 and @entity94 , who said the police were entitled to keep the computers			0
they said there was no foolproof way of deleting the offending material from the computers before returning them			0
and the law states that if it is not ' practicable ' to do that the item should be forfeited to the police			0
digital evidence recovery officer @entity106 told the court : ' deletion in a computer sense is a very complicated matter			0
' there is no such thing as a permanent deletion on computers unfortunately - or fortunately			0
' there is no way of permanently deleting it , short of putting it through a shredder			0
' ' i do n't talk to kids or touch them - i only get out once a fortnight ' @entity125 @entity124 , who arrested mr @entity1 , said : ' the vast proportion of images that were recovered from mr @entity1 's pc were adult in nature			1
the pornography that he had searched for was all adult			1
' the 11 ( child pornography ) images had been downloaded unwittingly , probably			1
' the police also said that because of the sheer volume of legal porn possessed by mr. @entity1 it would take days to transfer it to an external hard drive			1
that would cost up to £ 100 per new drive , plus police time , and mr @entity1 had refused to pay for that			2
judge @entity91 said : ' we see no way , on the evidence in front of us , that the hard drives could be returned to the appellant with the images deleted so that they can not be recovered			0
' mr. @entity1 , who said he only had £ 100 in savings , was ordered to pay £ 1,533 costs			2
after the case he said : ' if they had just been able to delete the images and give me my computers back it would 've saved a lot of court time and money			2
' i 'm gutted , but i 've had my day in court and i thought the judge was very fair			0
' he said he was paralysed after breaking his neck in an accident at home but has now recovered enough to walk with a stick			0
porn addict @entity1 yesterday denied any suggestion he was a paedophile and insisted : ' i hate that stuff			2
' i do n't download that kind of thing and i do n't go to those vile sites - i want them closed down			0
' i do n't talk to kids or touch them - i only get out once a fortnight			0

@entity1 escaped prosecution as the child images had probably been ' unwittingly ' downloaded
former lorry driver had huge collection of adult pornography that was automatically sent to his computers
says computer is better than a wife as you can ' turn it off '
