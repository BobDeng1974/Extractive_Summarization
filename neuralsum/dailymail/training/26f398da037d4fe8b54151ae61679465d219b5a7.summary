the female android robot , named @entity1 , looks on during a press unveiling at @entity3 in @entity4 in a dystopian future , the rise of our robot overlords may be far stealthier than you might expect			0
far from being terminator - like machines , these robots could look so human that , someday , we may not be able to tell man apart from machine			2
that day may still be in the distant future , but a new set of ultra-realistic robot newsreaders at a @entity4 museum reveals just how far research has developed in this area			2
named @entity21 and @entity1 , the creepy - looking robots speak so smoothly they are eerily lifelike			1
@entity23 robotics expert @entity22 , an @entity24 professor , said they will be useful for research on how people interact with robots			1
' making androids is about exploring what it means to be human , ' he told reporters tuesday , ' examining the question of what is emotion , what is awareness , what is thinking			0
' in a demonstration , the remote - controlled machines moved their lips in time to a voice - over , twitched their eyebrows , blinked and swayed their heads from side - to - side			1
in a demonstration , the remote - controlled machines moved their pink lips in time to a voice - over , twitched their eyebrows , blinked and swayed their heads from side to side @entity21 and the woman robot @entity1 ( right ) were joined at the demonstration by the minimally designed @entity57 ( left ) , a mannequin head with pointed arms that serves as a cuddly companion the prospect of robot friends and servants has been the topic of science fiction novels for years			1
but according to one mathematical model of how our brains create consciousness , emotional machines will never exist			0
this is because computers ca n't handle any process that completely integrates information , so they can not be conscious and capable of feeling , one expert claims			0
a mathematical framework for consciousness , developed over the last decade by @entity79 at the @entity80 , shows that computers can not handle the complex processes needed to mesh pieces of information together seamlessly			0
if consciousness is based on the integration of lots of pieces of information , computers ca n’t be conscious and capable of experiencing emotions like humans			0
powered by compressed air and servomotors , they were seated but could move their hands			0
@entity98 read the news without stumbling once and recited complex tongue - twisters glibly			1
the robots , designed with a girlish appearance , can use a variety of voices , such as a deep male voice one minute , and a squeaky girly voice the next			0
the speech can be input by text , giving them perfect articulation , according to @entity22			2
there were some glitches - such as the lips not moving at all while the robot spoke , or the @entity117 announcer robot staying silent twice when asked to introduce itself			1
but glitches are common with robots because they are delicate gadgetry sensitive to their environment , said the researchers			2
@entity21 and the woman robot @entity1 were joined at the demonstration by the minimally designed @entity57 , a mannequin head with pointed arms that serves as a cuddly companion			1
in what appeared like a scene out of ‘ @entity133 ’ , @entity130 asked professor @entity22 why he had created it			1
the professor replied that he wanted to create a child news announcer			2
the robots , which have silicone skin and artificial muscles , will be on display from wednesday , at @entity3 museum , or the @entity142 of @entity143 , in @entity4			1

pictured is @entity147 ( left ) with @entity23 robotics expert @entity22 ( right ) @entity98 read the news without stumbling once and recited complex tongue - twisters glibly			1
the robots , designed with a girlish appearance , can use a variety of voices , such as a deep male voice one minute and a squeaky girly voice the next reflecting widespread opinion , professor @entity22 said @entity23 leads the world in playful companion robots			1
but he acknowledged the nation was behind the @entity160 in military robots			0
' we will have more and more robots in our lives in the future , ' professor @entity22 said			1
' you can take my androids on planes - the torso in the suitcase and the head in carry - on			0
' professor @entity22 has a humanoid version of himself which he sends overseas to give lectures			1
' it cuts down on my business trips , ' he said			0
' technical advances mean robots look and act more human , and that makes us think about our worth			0
' his approach differs from some robotics scientists who say human appearance is pointless , perhaps creepy , and robots can look like machines , such as taking the form of a tv screen or a portable device			2
professor @entity22 noted proudly how @entity23 internet company @entity191 recently showed a robot named @entity193 , which looks a little like @entity194 in ‘ @entity195 , ’ and will sell for 198,000 yen ( £ 1,130 or $ 1,900 )			1
@entity193 's arrival means robots are increasingly becoming part of everyday life in @entity23			0
' robots are now becoming affordable - no different from owning a laptop , ' said professor @entity22			1
in a country dominated by ' kawaii ' - or cute culture - @entity23 has embraced the rise of cuddly robots			2
now , one @entity4 - based firm has unveiled what it believes to be the world 's first droid that can read human emotions			2
mobile carrier @entity191 said its robot , named @entity193 , will go on sale in @entity23 in february for 198,000 yen ( £ 1,130 or $ 1,900 )			0
the machine , which has no legs , but has gesticulating hands appeared on a stage in a @entity4 suburb , cooing and humming			0
@entity193 uses an ' emotional engine ' and a cloud - based artificial intelligence to study gestures , expressions and human speech tones			0
the 48 - inch ( 121 cm ) tall , 62 lb ( 28 kg ) white @entity193 has no hair , but two large doll - like eyes and a flat - panel display stuck on its chest			0
it was developed jointly with @entity230 , which designs , produces and sells autonomous humanoid robots .			2

the @entity21 and @entity147 droids were revealed at @entity234
both droids have silicone skin , artificial muscles and are remote - controlled
the creepy - looking robots speak so smoothly they are eerily lifelike
in a demonstration , robots read the news and interacted with the *audience*
there were some glitches such as lips not moving while one robot spoke
professor @entity22 , who developed the robots , has a humanoid version of himself which he sends overseas to give lectures
