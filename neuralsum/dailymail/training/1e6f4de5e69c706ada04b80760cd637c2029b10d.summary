i just wash my bits and rush out in the morning and more often than not get in the bath after @entity41			1
she added : ‘ i ’m sorry but whatever you do is helpful			0
we have to start somewhere			0
‘ i know @entity26 because i ’m a big friend of @entity44 and @entity45 and they introduced me to it			1
that ’s why i wanted to accept the invitation to do something to help stop cruelty to animals			0
‘ this is about how precious water is , it ’s more important than the gas that the people want to dig up and we ’re prepared to poison our water for that for example			2
eating meat is one of the most environmentally damaging things it ’s possible to do			0
‘ i ’m a person who ’s got enough money to make choices and this is my choice			0
we do n’t need to eat animals , there ’s too many of us anyway and eating animals is destroying the world			0
i believe that we are an endangered species and we need to think about what we ’re doing			0
we ’re probably killing our - selves through eating meat			2
