by @entity0 published : 17:09 est , 26 june 2013 updated : 17:30 est , 26 june 2013 just when i thought it was safe to step out in skinny jeans , along comes a trend to knock me off my fashion fulcrum , catapulting me back in time to the @entity6			1
yes , flares are back			1
part of me does n’t give a damn about trends			1
by the time you get to 60 you know what suits you - or at least you should			1
but though sticking to what you know may stop you becoming a fashion victim , it could also leave you looking like a style @entity20			1
i only started wearing skinny jeans - thanks to two perfectly - fitting pairs from @entity23 and @entity24 - in 2011			1
that was six years after @entity26 brought her skinny ‘ @entity28 ’ style to the @entity29 when she was brand director of @entity30			1
summer white : these are way too @entity33 me , although i bet the @entity35 girls will go mad forthem ... @entity37 flared jeans , £ 34.99 , mango.com			1
blue blouse , £ 110 , reiss.com @entity40 : more @entity42 palazzo pants than @entity44 flares , these feel grown - up and glamorous - perfect for a cocktail party , preferably on a yacht			1
@entity49 flares , £ 198 , theoutnet.com			1
@entity50 , £ 30 , newlook.co.uk @entity51 : teamed with a navy blazer , these extra wide flares look smart and sophisticated - i could see @entity55 on a shopping trip with the @entity57 wearing @entity58 , £ 216 , @entity59 , £ 25.99 , blazer , £ 79.99 , zara.com bell bottoms : these would be great to go out in at night , and are as comfy as leggings to wear in the day			2
slim boot - cut , £ 220 , @entity64 at @entity65			2
jacket , £ 60 , and top , £ 25 , topshop.com @entity68 : these were very long , but with heels they give an impressively leggy look			1
beware the short flare - you ’ll look like a @entity76 @entity75 , £ 182 , mih - jeans.com			2
@entity50 , £ 145 , @entity77 at @entity78			2
@entity79 , £ 9.99 , zara.com while all this was going on i adamant that skinny was only for the very young			2
however , when i dared to wear them , i felt i looked both fresher and more fashionable			2
so , rather than wait six years to try the flares trend , i decided to accept the challenge to give it a go now			0
when it comes to the flares revival , @entity86 is the woman we have to thank ( or blame )			1
she has flaunted her love affair with flares in @entity93 ’s ‘ @entity97 ’ bell - bottoms , as well as her signature , dark blue raw denims from her eponymous collection			0
and it ’s not just @entity86 flying the flares flag in 2013			0
@entity100 has worn hers on the red carpet , while @entity103 and @entity104 featured them in their collections			0
on the @entity29 , @entity106 and @entity107 have seen sales of flared trousers jump 57 per cent over the last year			0
in spite of all this , i have to say i groaned when i saw the rail of flares in front of me			0
however , after trying them on , i realised just how much they ’d moved on since their @entity6 heyday			0
like most jeans today , they have a degree of stretch which means they fit better and hold their shape , resulting in less flapping around your ankles			0
and when it comes to slimming and elongating your legs - especially if you team them with high heels or wedges - they are little short of miraculous			0
if you ’re more chubby than chive , skinnies really do n’t do you any favours , so the return of the flare should be welcomed both by larger women and those on the vertically challenged side , too			0
step back in time : actresses @entity144 , left , and @entity100 in flares styling : @entity147			0
hair and make - up : @entity153 @entity152 and @entity154			0

*designers* and *celebs* *fuelling* revival
@entity0 , 60 , tries them on again
she *surprised* at how *flattering* new styles are
