it 's the bane of cyclists around the world , but now the hassle of a puncture could be about to become history			0
a bike tyre that never gets a puncture because it is devoid of air is to go on sale			1
the solid tyres , which weigh the same as a normal tyre , still work after running over nails and shards of glass			1
they are made from @entity17 , an ultra-light polymer that absorbs the piercing and impact of sharp objects , and has a constant pressure			2
the company claims the tyres never get a puncture			1
they are made from a polymer called nanofoam - also found in trainers the weight of the tyres , made by company @entity23 , is 0.95lbs ( 430g ) which is 0.01lbs ( 5g ) less than a traditional tyre and inner tube			1
made of @entity41 , it is a similar technology to that used in lightweight trainers			2
they contain no rubber , but have a similar flexibility and are 100 per cent puncture resistant , according to the company			2
they fit all bikes with common clincher wheels including folding bikes and regular road bikes , and come in a range of sizes from children to adults			1
the tyres also have a lifespan of 6,000 miles ( 9,650km ) , but the company adds that skidding on the tyres would void the warranty as they are not built for it			1
@entity23 says it is now ready to produce more than three million of the tyres per year			1
the tyre has already proved popular in the @entity67 as a reliable commuter tyre where it has been fitted on more than 200,000 bikes			2
in the @entity72 the developers are also in discussion with folding bike company @entity74 and a number of other international bike manufacturers			0
there is no air in the tyres so they do not need to be pumped up			1
if nails , glass or other items become wedged in the tyres , they can simply be pulled out with a pair of pliers ( shown ) the weight and size of the bike tyres are nearly identical to a regular tyre			1
they have a range of 6,000 miles ( 9,650km ) and cost from £ 89 per pair @entity95 , a cycling entrepreneur who is behind the innovation , said : ' commuters can leave their house on their bike , safe with the knowledge that they will not get a puncture			1
back in july a @entity103 company unveiled its innovative bike for children that never falls over			0
called the @entity108 , it makes clever use of gyroscopes to keep the bike balanced even when a child leans from side - to - side			2
according to the company , this means a child can learn to ride the bike in just one day			0
the @entity108 works on the principle that a bike is more stable at higher speeds			0
inside the front wheel of the bicycle is a fast spinning disc			0
this creates a gyroscopic force that balances the bike even when it is ridden slowly , as might be expected for a child getting behind the handlebars for the first time			0
' riders do n't have to worry about reliability			0
they never have to worry about getting to work late , changing a punctured tyre in the freezing weather and worrying about what time they will get home on their bike			0
' they do n't need the fuss of pump , spare inner tubes or tyre levers			0
' we are hoping this will open up cycling to people who would previously have never considered getting on a bike			0
' in that way the tyres represent a major shift in cycling history			0
' the fundamentals of cycling have barely changed in more than a century - but this represents a revolution			0
' solid tyres have been looked at before , but none were as light , as safe or reliable in the long - term			1
' the tyres , which come in 14 different colours , are currently being sold in a handful of @entity164 shops including the @entity165 in @entity166 , @entity25 and online at the website for @entity23			1
