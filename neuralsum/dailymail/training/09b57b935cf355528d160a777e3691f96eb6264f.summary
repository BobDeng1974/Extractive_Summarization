a madcap decorator has painted a baseball every day for 34 years to create the world 's - largest ball of paint			1
dedicated @entity5 , 64 , has plastered a new coat daily since embarking on the bizarre project in 1960s			1
he has plastered an incredible 22,894 coats of paint to create the mammoth ball - which now weighs a staggering 3,500lbs ( 1587kg ) laying it on thick : @entity5 applies the 22539th coat of paint to a giant baseball at his home in @entity16 , @entity17 the ball is now a whopping 22.48 inches in diameter ( 70.58 inch circumference ) and is officially recognised by the @entity21 as the biggest ever recorded			1
it is now so large that it requires re-enforced metal rods to suspend it from the roof of @entity27 ' shed - which he custom - built 15 years ago to house the behemoth			0
he set up a website highlighting the attraction and now people travel from all over the world to visit @entity5 and add a coat , which is painstakingly documented in a ledger at home			1
speaking yesterday , @entity5 said : ' it started as a relatively simple project and a bit of fun			1
but i just kept on painting and painting and painting			0
and before i knew it , it was enormous			0
how it all began : the first coat of paint is applied to @entity5 's baseball by his son @entity51 in 1977 ' then i did n't want to stop			1
i moved it out the garage a good few years ago after it outgrew it and now it has it 's own special shed			0
' people come from all over the world to add a coat			0
sometimes i can add up to ten coats a day if the weather is dry , but we 've added at least one every day			0
' grandfather - of - six @entity5 , who lives in @entity16 in the @entity65 state of @entity17 with wife @entity66 , 61 , said that he first produced a ball by accident in 60s , but he embarked on the bizarre project in january 1977			1
@entity71 and decorator @entity5 estimates he has spent thousands of dollars daubing the baseball , which was a mere 2.86 inches in diameter ( nine inches circumference ) when he started			1
his son @entity51 applied the first coat with a paint brush , but @entity5 now requires a roller due to the sheer size			1
landmark : the 1500th coat of paint is applied to the ball			2
the only rule is that each new coat has to be a different colour to the one before it getting bigger : the 13,300th coat of paint is applied to ball			2
visitors have flocked from around the world to add new coats of paint @entity5 added : ' people come from far and wide to see it and add their own coat			1
' i 've got to met some really interesting people as a result and always thank them and take their picture			0
' i have absolutely no idea what i 'm going to do with it but have no plans to stop painting it			0
' my grandchildren have expressed an interest in it so maybe it could become a family heirloom			1
' @entity5 said that he began his first paintball in the 60s when on a summer vacation he was working at a local paint store and was throwing a baseball			2
' it knocked over a gallon of paint and the ball was covered , ' he added			2
' we cleaned up the paint up from the floor but left the ball as it was , with paint on it			2
i set it on top an old table , and the next day i went to get it i was sparked with the idea			0
' @entity5 then wrapped a wire around the ball and dipped it in a gallon of paint and repeated the process			1
when he got to 1,000 coats he donated to a children 's home			0
@entity5 added : ' after several years i knew that someday i wanted to start another one and in 1977 , my wife @entity66 , and i had started another baseball			2
' on january 1 , 1977 i let my son at the age of three put the very first coat of blue paint on the ball			0
' we painted the ball many times a day , while the ball was little and easy to handle and @entity66 painted the ball several times a day while i was working ; i painted it in the evenings and on the weekends			0
' after a while , it became a piece of artwork and we rather enjoyed showing it off and now it 's become an attraction that people love to come and see			0

decorator @entity5 will hand down ball as a a family heirloom
