by @entity0 @entity2 scientists have created a wearable computer for dogs that they say could allow man 's best friend to send messages to handlers			1
the technology might initially sound barking mad , but its creators at @entity10 believe that it will give crime dogs and other k - 9s a clearer and more direct way to communicate with their handlers			1
the @entity16 - inspired technology for hounds may even let us humans view the world through a dog 's eyes			2
the @entity16 - inspired technology for hounds may even let us view the world through a dog 's eyes while gadget lovers await the commercial release of @entity16 in 2014 , @entity27 , the technical leader on @entity29 's upcoming eyewear , has teamed up with scientists at the institute to develop a computerised harness to aid working dogs , the @entity26 reports			1
the project , titled @entity37 ( @entity38 ) , could allow a bomb - sniffing , cadaver or other working dog to activate a sensor which would then send information to the dogâ € ™ s handler , according to the @entity26			1
as of now the developers are testing a new device that allows the dog using it to activate a signal which is sent to its handler through an earpiece			0
the @entity37 system works by the dog activating a sensor on the its vest or collar to transmit a verbal command , which the handler can hear through an earpiece of see on a head - mounted display , perhaps like @entity16			2
the researchers fitted a dog vest with an @entity64 microprocessor and tested four different sensors that dogs could activate by tugging , biting or simply putting close to their mouths			0
professor @entity69 , who is working on the project has been training assistance dogs for around 18 years , said that working dogs talking part in the early study quickly learned to trigger the sensors to set off a tone			2
the results of the trial will be published in a paper and presented at the @entity80 in october			0
better communication : the project , titled @entity37 , could allow guide dogs and bomb - detecting dogs to activate a sensor which would then send information to their handler eventually the technology could transmit video from a dogâ € ™ s perception to a human viewer , the @entity26 reported			1
associate professor @entity69 said that service dogs that tested the gadget quickly got the hang of the sensors , which they were able to activate by using their mouths			0
she said that the @entity37 technology could help disabled people navigate more effectively and let bomb - detecting dogs communicate with their handlers from a distance - even telling them abut a specific type of bomb that they have found			1
similarly , the scientists believe that the system could allow rescue dogs to alert a human team from afar when they have found an injured person			2
of course the technology could be of interest to pet owners too in the future			0
professor @entity114 said that it could be used to let humans know when a dog is hungry or wants to go outside - perhaps even by a text message			0
signaling : the device will allow the dog using it to activate a signal which is sent to its handler through an earpiece			0

scientists from the @entity10 have created a wearable canine computer that could allow dogs to send messages to handlers
project @entity37 , ' @entity38 for @entity132 ' is the *brainchild* of the *original* technical lead of @entity16 , @entity27
the technology could help disabled people navigate more effectively and let bomb - detecting dogs communicate with their handlers from a distance
