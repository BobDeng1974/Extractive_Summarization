and it seems modern men are little different from the knights of @entity15 legend			0
a new study reveals that men are willing to take dangerous gambles to get the attention of the opposite sex , and the romantic tendency is apparently firmly rooted in evolution			0
sir @entity1 rides off with his lover @entity10 , the wife of @entity15 : a new study reveals that men are willing to take dangerous gambles to win the attention of the opposite sex - and the tendency is rooted in evolution one version of the @entity1 legend has the gallant knight falling in love after catching only the briefest glance of @entity15 's wife @entity10			1
after she is kidnapped by the evil knight @entity6 , @entity1 is willing to jeopardise his honour as a knight by riding in a cart reserved for criminals , then face death in a duel to rescue her			2
finally , after further trials , he risks the jealous rage of @entity15 himself by becoming @entity10 's adulterous lover			2
and it 's not just @entity1 : from @entity43 to @entity44 , myths and fiction are are littered with men willing to face potentially deadly trials in the name of romance			1
but taking risks to impress women has a strong foundation in real life , where the willingness to face dangers for the fairer sex has been commonplace since the dawn of man			2
a recent study from the @entity61 finds risk - taking behaviour has in part been evolved to enhance an individual 's ability to attract a mate			1
according to the study : ' in the evolutionary past , our ancestors were faced with a hazardous environment where they were forced to take greater risks in order to find shelter , food and sexual partners			0
' thus , individuals who played it safe in that they did not take any risks at all , were unlikely to survive			0
' @entity81 : the study looked at three examples of risk taking behaviour in men and women - sexual risk taking , gambling and reckless driving - and found men were more willing to take risks for women so , it appears , men have inherited this willingness to face dangers for women from our risk - friendly ancestors			1
but in a modern age where these primeval problems are all but extinct , men are looking for other risks to boast their willingness to face danger			0
the study looks at three examples of risk taking behaviour in men and women : sexual risk taking ( like unprotected sex ) , gambling and reckless driving			1
in all three tests , men were more likely to take the inherent risks involved once a romantic element has been induced			1
women however showed no more desire to take unnecessary risks			0
of course , the authors note , while these activities may have perceived short term benefits , their long - term effects are potentially devastating			0
that 's something wannabe white knights may want to consider in the run - up to @entity132 .			0

like @entity1 , men are willing to risk all for a woman 's love
*researchers* say it evolved because risk - taking helped men attract a mate
tests show men are more willing to take risks where romance is involved
