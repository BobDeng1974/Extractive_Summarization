by @entity0 a girl who was left disfigured after a raccoon savagely mauled her in her crib will finally be given a right ear today - almost 12 years after the attack			1
@entity7 was three months old when the animal chewed off most of her face in 2002 , making headlines around the world			1
she was adopted by her great aunt and spent years in and out of hospital , including for a procedure two years ago which gave her a new nose			1
brave : @entity7 was just three months old when a raccoon chewed off her nose , ear and lips adopted : @entity23 's parents lost custody of her and she was taken in by her great - uncle @entity27 , pictured tragic : now 11 , @entity23 has been in and out of hospital but it is hoped today 's procedure will be the last now 11 , she will go back under the knife for up to eight hours in what could be her last operation			1
but it will be the most complex yet , as it is claimed it has only been performed twice before			0
dr. @entity35 will take cartilage from @entity23 's ribs and carve it into the shape of an ear using a computer - generated template			1
he admitted the procedure is not easy and he will only have one chance to get it right , so he has been practicing on a potato			2
dr @entity35 , of @entity45 in @entity46 , @entity47 , told @entity48 : ' as plastic surgeons we need to think outside the box a little bit - what can we do to make a life long reconstruction for her			1
' i 've been practicing carving potato last weekend using this as a template			2
' mauled : @entity23 @entity62 as a baby before and after the attack			2
her adopted parents say she is still a happy girl surgery : the same doctor who gave @entity23 a new nose , pictured , will mould a right ear out of cartilage from her ribcage and ' grow ' it in her forearm for around two months before transplanting it onto her face ready to go : @entity23 packs her bags yesterday at her home in @entity78 as she prepares to leave for hospital he will implant the basic structure of the ear under the skin of @entity23 's forearm , where it will take several weeks to mould into a fully - formed ear before it can be transplanted again			1
dr @entity35 , who will perform the initial procedure today and finish the work in june , was the same doctor who built @entity23 a new nose and repaired her lip and cheek			1
he said he could not guarantee success , but would try his best			0
@entity23 's adopted mother @entity94 said people from as far as @entity96 and @entity97 had contacted the family to tell them what an inspiration the girl has been			0
heart - wrending photos show @entity23 , her skin remarkably well - repaired since her last run of surgery , packing her suitcase yesterday to return for her last big trip to the hospital			2
she was just a newborn when her 18 - year - old mother and 23 - year - old father left her home alone with the pet			2
change : @entity23 's adopted family have more gentle pets			0
here she plays with one of her guinea pigs good spirits : remarkably @entity23 retained the hearing in her right ear despite the catastrophic damage playing : the whole procedure , which has almost never been done before , will take around two months the raccoon was thought to have escaped from its cage after a door was left open when food had been dropped in , and no one was there to save the baby when she was attacked			0
her great - aunt @entity94 and great - uncle @entity27 only found out about the attack with horror when they watched that night 's news bulletin			2
they gained custody of @entity23 and her brother @entity135 , who was then 15 months old , and they and their friends raised more than $ 10,000 to help pay for her trips in and out of hospital			0
@entity94 had to quit her job at a daycare center to look after @entity23 after doctors said she would need full time care			0
although ears have been made out of ribs before , the method of ' growing ' the ear inside the forearm is extremely rare			0
remarkable : @entity23 with her adopted mother @entity94 and dr @entity35 after he built her a new nose in a 2012 operation			1
he said today 's surgery will hopefully be the last major work she has done attack : it has been a slow recovery for @entity23 , who lived for a decade without a reconstructed nose intact : @entity23 as a baby with her brother @entity135 before she was attacked in late 2002 happy family : @entity23 now lives with ( from left ) her great - uncle @entity27 , great - aunt @entity94 and brother @entity135 it has to be done because @entity23 's ear was so badly damaged that the foundations of an ear structure no longer exist inside her head			1
@entity23 previously had a prosthetic ear fitted but it was not an ideal solution and soon became infected and uncomfortable			0
yet despite the enormous damage , there is one miracle			0
even before the extensive surgery which will grant her a new quality of life , @entity23 's hearing has been largely unaffected .			0

@entity7 from @entity78 , @entity47 , left disfigured by 2002 attack
today she will have *radical* surgery which has only been done twice before
dr @entity35 is same plastic surgeon who gave her a new nose
he will cut cartilage from her ribcage - and has been practicing on a potato
