they say that diamonds are a girl 's best friend			0
and some lucky girls will never be short of friends thanks to another sparkling find by @entity8 miners @entity9			1
supplying to prestigious clients such as @entity14 - @entity13 's jeweller of choice - the diamond producer has dug up some of the largest most valuable gems in the world			2
@entity9 sold the 164 carat type @entity20 rough diamond ' of an exceptional quality ' for £ 6m in addition to the recovery of the 164 carat diamond , a 103 carat gem was also recovered from the @entity27 pipe in 2011 they uncovered the world 's 14th biggest white diamond from their @entity33 @entity32 mine - which they sold for £ 11million in the rough - and now , the same fruitful bit of land has sprouted another super gem			1
the 164 carat beast was discovered on april 30 and has already been sold in the rough for £ 6million			2
these diamonds and anything of their size are rare to recover , especially when they are of high first class quality			0
though the real test to find the gem 's worth comes now as it 's currently being computer analysed in @entity47 , @entity48 , as experts look for flaws and weaknesses - but say it 's value can only increase			1
@entity13 , on the set of @entity54 , was a fan of @entity14 , one of @entity9 's clients large round cut diamonds are in high demand at the moment , so @entity59 might be hoping to find a part of the stone suitable for this purpose			1
gem tell the @entity64 that the manufacturing process is a complicated one to understand : ' the 164ct is an exceptional d colour , type iia rough diamond with the potential to yield flawless polished diamonds			0
' the initial analysis , using @entity9 ' high tech computerised analytical capability in @entity47 ( @entity76 ) revealed a number of potential polished options with respect to quantity , size , shape and clarity of the individual polished diamonds			2
' now that the diamond has been sold , it will be sent for closer examination , where windows ( polished surfaces ) are opened onto the stone to allow for greater accuracy in determining the most optimal polished value through the use of computer algorithms			0
' while @entity33 diamonds have in the past faced controversy over being a potential produce of conflict , gem pride themselves in complying with the @entity101 ' ' the most optimal solution from a valuation and marketing perspective will then be chosen and the stone will then be laser sawn into a number of pieces , shaped and then polished to deliver the potentially flawless polished diamonds			2
' these large high value polished diamonds are eventually purchased by the highest end retail brands , such as @entity112 , @entity14 and @entity113 etc. and are set into unique pieces of jewellery for sale to their high net worth customers			0
' while @entity33 diamonds have in the past faced controversy over being a potential produce of conflict , gem pride themselves in complying with the @entity101 established in 2003 to prevent conflict ( blood ) diamonds from entering the mainstream rough diamond market			1
a spokesman said : ' @entity9 continues to comply with @entity101 initiative			0
' the @entity128 is committed to the principles and practices of sustainable development and believe an active and engaged approach to sustainability to be key to their ability to meet responsibilities to all stakeholders : shareholders , employees , communities and the environment			0
' the diamond , recovered from the @entity27 pipe at the @entity32 mine , is expected to produce top colour and top clarity polished diamonds and has been sold into a profit sharing arrangement for £ 6million ( £ 37,000 per carat ) , whereby the rough price is received upfront			2
the 550 carat diamond , the world 's 13th biggest ever ( l ) and a pair of @entity112 earrings made with gem stones ( r ) @entity155 will benefit further from a significant share of the downstream polished margin from the sale of the polished diamonds			1
further work focusing on reducing diamond damage at @entity161 continues and it is pleasing to report that in addition to the recovery of the 164 carat diamond , a 103 carat diamond was also recovered from the @entity27 pipe during may 2013 and that both diamonds were undamaged			0
the 103 carat diamond , which is not of the same high quality as the 164 carat diamond , will be sold on the next tender in june			0
@entity9 ceo , @entity170 stated : ' the recovery and sale of this high quality 164 carat white diamond reinforces @entity176 's position as the premier source of exceptional diamonds			1
' @entity9 is a @entity8 @entity179 listed on the @entity180 with assets in @entity182 and @entity183 .			1
