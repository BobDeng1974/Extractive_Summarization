@entity1 terrorists have released a horrific new video showing the execution of a prisoner killed with a pump - action shotgun			1
this latest graphic and shocking footage has all the militants ' trademark slick production effects and features a light - skinned executioner dressed in similar costume to the now infamous ' @entity11 '			2
the prisoner , believed to be a @entity14 soldier captured by @entity15 , is forced to wear the same kind of orange jumpsuit worn by @entity19 hostages before they are savagely beheaded by the terror group			1
the killer is seen ranting in @entity22 behind the doomed prisoner before the @entity25 footage is edited into slow - motion and the militant is seen catching the shotgun , thrown to him by somebody off camera			1
seconds later he fires a single round into the back of the victim 's head causing horrific injuries far too graphic to publish			2
the film rewinds and replays the moment of impact in gruesome detail several times , before cutting to a shot of a pool of blood and the prisoner 's dead body			1
in the film the unidentified killer wears the now familiar uniform of the @entity1 executioner - a black robe , a black balaclava to mask his identity and a brown leather gunbelt			0
but in a departure from the terror group 's notorious beheading videos , this latest execution is carried out with a pump - action shotgun - a weapon more often associated with gangland killings in the @entity66 and @entity67 than jihadis			0
the film begins with the captured soldier - understood to be a member of @entity73 's @entity72 - wearing a military combat uniform as he is made to read a statement to the camera			0
he is then seen having his hands tied behind his back being marched to an area of scrubland behind a stone wall beneath a hill			0
@entity84 music - known as a nasheed - accompanies the video as the prisoner appears resigned to his inevitable grisly fate			2
sick : the killer is seen ranting in @entity22 behind the doomed prisoner before the @entity25 footage is edited into slow - motion and the militant is seen catching the shotgun , thrown to him by somebody off camera killer : when he finally finishes ranting the @entity15 executioner raises the shotgun and fires a single round into the back of the man 's head , causing him to slump forwards , face - down in the dirt after being led to the courtyard the prisoner is forced to kneel in front of the executioner while he issues what appears to be be the customary warning to the enemies of the @entity1			1
when he finally finishes ranting the killer raises the shotgun and fires a single round into the back of the man 's head , causing him to slump forwards , face - down in the dirt			1
the video finishes with a graphic slow - motion playback of the blasting of the shotgun into the man 's head , as well as gruesome close up shots of his dead body			1
the shotgun method of execution marks a departure from the now familiar beheadings witnessed in previous videos but the impact is no less graphic			0
horrific : the most recent video execution , before the film of the ' shotgun ' killing was released , was that of @entity144 pilot @entity142 who was burned to death in a cage ( pictured ) anger : @entity149 ( centre in red head scarf ) , the father of slain @entity144 pilot @entity153 , leads @entity155 demonstrators in @entity144 following his son 's brutal murder the most recent video execution , before the film of the ' shotgun ' killing was released , was that of @entity144 pilot @entity142 who was burned to death in a cage			1
the release of the video , which may have been filmed some weeks ago , shocked the world and provoked a military response from the @entity166 who launched a series of air strikes against the extremists ' strongholds in northern @entity14			2
@entity15 terrorists have killed 2,000 people in @entity14 during the past six months , the majority of them civilians			0
over the past two months , @entity15 has also executed 120 of its own members , most of them foreign fighters trying to return home , according to the @entity67 - based @entity179			0
@entity15 has taken vast parts of @entity181 and @entity14 and last june declared a caliphate in the territory under its control			0
