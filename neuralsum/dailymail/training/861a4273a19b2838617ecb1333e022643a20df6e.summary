by @entity0 @entity1 , 35 , experienced painful varicose veins in her legs which then appeared in her vagina as a doting mother of four , @entity1 loves being at the centre of family life			1
but becoming a mother has cost her health - and self - confidence - dearly			1
@entity1 , 35 , enjoyed trouble - free pregnancies with her first two children @entity12 , now 15 , and daughter @entity13 , now 12			1
' i loved being pregnant and wanted a big family , ' she recalls			0
when she and partner @entity17 , 35 , a salesman , found out they were expecting a third child , they were thrilled			2
' i had the usual stretch marks after being pregnant twice before , ' recalls @entity1 , from @entity21 , @entity22			1
' so when they started popping up again , i did n't mind			2
' but when she was around 14 weeks pregnant she noticed large , blue veins on her legs - they began in clusters around her ankles then spread further up			1
' i 'd joke to @entity17 about adding varicose veins to my pregnancy battle scars , ' she remembers.varicose veins develop when the veins stretch and the valves inside them , which prevent blood flowing the wrong way , fail to work			1
blood pools in the veins , causing them to become swollen , enlarged and painful			2
they are common in pregnancy as hormones relax the walls of the veins and more blood is produced to support the growing baby , putting strain on the veins			1
as her pregnancy progressed , @entity1 noticed more and more unsightly , dark blue veins on her legs			1
' they began to look like road maps , ' she says			0
' i had to cover up with trousers or maxi skirts			0
' then one night when she was 20 weeks pregnant , she felt a hard , lumpy vein in her vaginal area while bathing			2
' i realised in horror what it was , ' she says			0
' i could n't see it , but it was a varicose vein - just like the huge ones on my legs			1
' the following day , she felt another one , then another , and they started causing great discomfort			0
' i told my midwife about the veins in my legs and she said they were normal in pregnancy			1
then i told her about the ones i 'd found down there			2
' after an examination the midwife confirmed it was varicose veins , or vaginal varicosities			1
@entity1 was referred to a consultant gynaecologist , who said they 'd probably diminish after the birth			2
' i was amazed - i 'd never read anything about this , or even heard anyone talk about it before , ' says @entity1			1
' i wondered how many other women were hobbling around like me , mortified			0
' in fact , vaginal ( or vulval ) varicose veins become more common with each pregnancy a woman has , explains dr @entity103 , consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist at @entity105 , @entity106			1
' they occur both in the vagina and in the vulva			0
they are the same as varicose veins in the leg ; they lead to swelling , and are rather uncomfortable			1
' they are caused by the baby sitting on the large blood vessels that drain blood from your legs , causing back pressure , and hence the veins widen			2
' professor @entity123 , consultant surgeon and clinical director of @entity125 , thinks the condition could be more common than doctors realise			0
according to his research , one in five women who 've had a previous vaginal delivery and suffers with varicose veins of the legs , also has varicose veins in the pelvis and vaginal area			1
' fortunately , in most patients , the veins are either relatively small or deep , so most ladies are not aware they have them			2
' he explains that pregnancy hormones that prepare a woman 's body for labour and an increase in the volume of blood mean these vulval and vaginal varicose veins can be seen more easily			1
' after pregnancy , once the hormones and blood volume return to normal , the veins shrink and in some people appear to have completely gone			2
' however , with specialised transvaginal scans we can see if the varicose veins in the pelvis or vagina are still there			1
they can contribute to varicose veins in the legs			1
' but professor @entity123 adds that because it is not easy to get a clear picture of the female pelvis from standard scans , often women are told they are imagining the problem			2
yet these veins can have a depressingly real effect			0
as professor @entity123 explains : ' women can suffer symptoms such as dragging pain , discomfort during sexual intercourse , and irritable bladder			0
this is due to the weight of the varicose veins in the pelvis pushing on these organs			1
' the medical term for this is pelvic congestion syndrome			0
@entity1 has been told they wo n't go away and there is nothing more she can do @entity1 's veins continued growing during her pregnancy - both in size and quantity - along with her discomfort			1
' it began as being uncomfortable , then progressed to severe pain - soon i could barely walk and needed crutches because the veins made my legs swell so much it hurt to move			1
' i was so embarrassed			0
i did n't let @entity17 anywhere near me and worried how our sex life would be after the birth			0
it was bad enough having unsightly veins on my legs , let alone there			2
' i did n't tell my friends			0
most pregnant women compare stretch marks or bumps			0
how could i discuss what i had going on down below ? ' @entity1 's daughter , @entity211 , now five , was delivered by emergency @entity212 , and she was hopeful the veins would soon go			1
but six months later , the veins on her legs were as large and blue as before			1
the vaginal veins diminished a little over time , but remained very uncomfortable			2
her gp said there was nothing anyone could do			0
two years later , @entity1 was pregnant again			2
but her joy was tempered by the fear that the veins would worsen			0
sure enough , at ten weeks the hard blue veins started appearing again - new ones as well as the existing veins			1
' the midwife gave me stockings , to support the veins in the legs , but there was nothing i could do about the others , ' she says			2
' i was in agony			0
' because of her pregnancy , @entity1 could n't take strong pain relief			1
' i just had to put up with it , ' she says			0
as the weeks passed , more and more veins appeared and she again had difficulty walking , ending up on crutches			0
' my legs were like something from a horror film , ' she says			0
' i felt like a freak			0
' as for a romantic life with @entity17 , ' it would have been too uncomfortable and embarrassing '			0
with the birth of their son @entity252 , now 17 months , ' we had our complete family - two boys , two girls ' , says @entity1			1
' but it had come at a cost			0
my veins did n't go in the weeks after @entity252 's birth			2
i knew they never would			0
' @entity1 has been told they wo n't go away and there is nothing more she can do			1
but professor @entity123 says this information is wrong			0
' it is amazing how few gynaecologists , gps and nurses know there is treatment available , ' he says			0
the number of adults who are affected by varicose veins ' what these women need is a specialist transvaginal duplex scan , which shows exactly which veins in the pelvis are causing the problem			1
once they are known , little metal coils can be placed inside these veins which then completely shrivel away			0
' professor @entity123 believes treating the veins would help the varicose veins in the legs			1
' our research , about to be published in the journal of @entity291 : venous and @entity293 , suggests failure to treat these veins is a major reason why leg varicose veins come back after treatment in up to a third of women			1
' unfortunately , this specialist treatment is not widely available			0
charmaine herself is pragmatic about her situation			0
' it was a nasty thing to go through but is a small price to pay for our lovely family			0

@entity1 , 35 , from @entity21 , suffers from vaginal varicose veins
mother of four noticed lots of dark blue veins on her legs in 3rd pregnancy
they calmed down but returned - even worse - during her fourth pregnancy
she has been told they wo n't go away and there is nothing more she can do
