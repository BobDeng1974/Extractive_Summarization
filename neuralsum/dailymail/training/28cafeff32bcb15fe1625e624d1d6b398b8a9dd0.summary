by @entity0 being bullied at school could raise the odds of having a heart attack as an adult			0
a study found that men and women who had been victims of bullying as children had higher levels of a blood protein linked to heart attacks and strokes			1
however , the reverse was true of the bullies			0
they had made less of the suspect compound than others			0
the researchers analysed data collected from almost 1,500 people during childhood , throughout their teenage years and into adulthood			1
disease risk : being bullied can lead to health problems later in life ( photo posed by models ) this included blood samples and interviews about their experience of bullying			2
levels of c - reactive protein , which is linked to a host of health problems , including heart attacks and strokes , rose with age			1
however , they were highest in those who had been bullied as children			0
and the more they had been bullied , the more c - reactive protein they made			2
those who did the bullying had the lowest levels – lower even than those who had no involvement in bullying , the journal @entity47 reports			0
researcher dr @entity55 , of @entity56 in @entity57 , said : ‘ enhanced social status seems to have a biological advantage			1
' social advantage ' : the study concluded that bullies were actually least at risk ‘ however , there are ways children can experience social success aside from bullying others			2
’ he added that bullying can be added to poor nutrition , lack of sleep and other factors known to affect c - reactive protein levels			1
a recent @entity77 study found those bullied as children were more likely to have poor mental and physical health 40 years later , aged 50			1
they were also less likely to be in a relationship and less happy with life			0
the researchers from the @entity85 at @entity86 , said : ‘ we need to move away from any perception that bullying is just an inevitable part of growing - up			2
‘ teachers , parents and policy - makers should be aware that what happens in the school playground can have long - term repercussions for children			0

@entity100 study linked childhood *trauma* with protein which causes poor health
researchers at @entity56 , @entity57 , *tested* 1,500 people
they found that those who did the bullying were least *susceptible*
