by @entity0 published : 06:04 est , 18 april 2013 updated : 06:56 est , 18 april 2013 most people associate going under the knife with backless hospital gowns and anaesthetic face masks , but that could be about to change			1
the patients of the future could be wheeled out of the operating theatre still humming the @entity10 theme tune			2
@entity11 is giving patients the opportunity to watch their favourite film while in theatre to avoid them needing a general anaesthetic			1
@entity17 , 75 , had hip surgery while watching @entity19			0
she is pictured with anaesthetist @entity20 who came up with the idea older patients undergoing certain orthopaedic procedures are being offered a film or tv programme as a way of keeping them relaxed and happy while their operation is carried out using local anaesthetic			1
the work is being led by consultant anaesthetist dr @entity20 who says this approach is proving to be of particular benefit to patients who carry an increased risk of reacting badly to a general anaesthetic			1
he said : ‘ patients really relax when they are watching their favourite films			1
some have told us the tv can be so captivating that they are unaware that the operation has finished			0
‘ one patient watched the @entity19 while undergoing a hip operation while another recently had a knee revision operation while watching the @entity47 nature documentary series @entity48			0
‘ but the most popular movie at the moment , particularly among our older female patients , is @entity10			1
’ he added : ‘ i am pleased that this idea is proving popular with patients as it means we can reduce the number of general anaesthetics given to older patients			1
‘ it is more common for this group of patients to experience unpleasant side effects coming round afterwards			0
‘ if they are happy to be awake and watch the tv , i am happy that they are going to have a better experience			0
the 1987 film @entity10 is said to be the most popular choice among elderly female patients @entity17 , 75 , from @entity68 in @entity69 , was one of the first patients to benefit from the new technique			1
ms @entity17 fell and broke her hip and required surgery to repair the fracture			0
she had previously had a bad reaction to a general anaesthetic so was offered the chance to be awake , and watching a film , during the surgery			1
she said : ‘ i have had a general anaesthetic in the past and it took me ages to feel better afterwards			2
it made me feel terrible and i was dreading having to go through it again			0
‘ when dr @entity20 told me that patients were being offered the chance to have a spinal anaesthetic and watch tv while the operation was going on i was really pleased and asked to have it straight away			2
‘ dr @entity20 brought me a selection of dvds to choose from and i decided to go for @entity19 as i love that film			0
‘ i wore earphones so that i could hear the film , although i did stop watching from time to time to have a chat with dr @entity20			2
‘ it was a good experience and a much better way to have an operation			0
i never expected this would be an option and i have vowed that if i ever need another operation like this i will ask to be able to watch tv again			0

watching a film relaxes patients , so they only need local anaesthetic
idea was *developed* by an anaesthetist at @entity11
means that elderly people avoid risky general anaesthetics
dirty *dancing* is the most popular choice among female patients
