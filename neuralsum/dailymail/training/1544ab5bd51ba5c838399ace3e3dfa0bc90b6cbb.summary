concern : @entity1 , @entity2 's wife , says teabags are an environmental threat some environmental activists get worked up about rainforests			1
others worry about the plight of polar bears or the perils of rising sea levels			0
but for @entity13 , an economist , green guru and wife of the new governor of the @entity17 , the issue that gets her really , really hot under the collar is the humble tea bag			1
she describes the leaf - filled sachets as one of her ‘ pet hates ’ and says they are an environmental disaster			0
‘ yes , they can be pretty , and convenient , but do we really need an extra 40 square cm of bleached and printed paper with every cup of tea ? ’ she writes on her blog , which reviews eco-friendly products			2
her husband was hopefully too preoccupied with the huge challenges of his new job at @entity34 which he started yesterday to worry unduly about the contents of the @entity17 tea urn			0
but for those millions who adore the convenience of the tea bag , it was enough to make us choke on our @entity41 ’s			0
so does mrs @entity13 have a point ? and are tea bags really doing untold harm to the planet ? the scale of the @entity48 tea bag was invented by accident more than 100 years ago by @entity52 merchant @entity50 , who decided to send samples of tea to customers in small silk pouches			1
some people were confused — assuming that the bags were supposed to be dunked in hot water just like traditional metal tea infusers			2
when @entity50 heard what they were doing , he spotted a gap in the market			0
thus , serendipitously , the tea bag was born			0
environmental disaster ? : tea bags could be doing untold harm to the planet at first , there were complaints that the mesh of the bags was too fine , so he replaced the silk with gauze			1
and as tea bags entered mass production , cheaper paper was used instead			1
at first , the @entity81 were reluctant to abandon loose leaf tea , but by the 1950s , when families were embracing new labour - saving gadgets like never before , tea bags took off			1
@entity87 , of the @entity81 @entity88 , credits the tea bag with saving the tea industry			1
‘ we would not be drinking the volume of tea we do now without them , ’ he says			0
‘ the @entity81 is the second - largest tea market per person in the world			1
without tea bags , the industry would be on its knees			1
’ are they a waste of paper ? major brands such as @entity106 , @entity41 and @entity107 no longer use wood pulp to make their paper , but a vegetable fibre derived from the abaca plant — a relative of the banana grown mostly in @entity114 and @entity115			2
however , we certainly use a lot of it			0
enduring popularity : the @entity81 is the second - largest tea market in the world , and @entity98 is the first according to the @entity88 , the @entity81 drink around 60 billion cups of tea every year			1
around 96 per cent of those are made with tea bags			1
that means more than 55 billion tea bags are dunked , squeezed and tossed away each year in the @entity81 alone			1
it adds up to a lot of paper , particularly when so many tea bags are no longer rectangular — the least wasteful design for a tea bag — but round or pyramid - shaped			1
a @entity106 pyramid bag , for instance , is made from a rectangle of perforated filter paper approximately 70 square cm. a traditional square tea bag , on the other hand , uses around 50 square cm of paper			2
so a tea lover who drinks five cups a day will get through 13 square metre of perforated paper each year			1
a couple living with two teenage children could get through 50 square metre of tea bag paper each year			1
it seems a lot , but not when put in perspective			0
according to a paper industry survey a few years ago , the typical @entity151 uses 80 to 90 rolls of loo paper each year			2
meanwhile , the 50 square metre of tea bag paper we use is the equivalent of only around two or three rolls of quality loo paper			2
if you count all the paper , cardboard , packaging , papers and phone directories , the typical family uses the equivalent of six trees a year			2
the 50 sq m of thin bag paper pales in @entity171 ? organic : environmentally - friendly companies such as @entity174 use unbleached bags unless you buy from an environmentally - friendly company such as @entity174 ( which uses unbleached bags ) , most of us consume clean , white tea bags that are the result of intensive chemical processes			1
once , the wood pulp or vegetable fibre used in tea bags was bleached with chlorine to make it white rather than an unappealing grey			1
however , bleaching attracted criticism from environmentalists because minute amounts of potentially toxic by - products such as dioxins and furans , chemicals which cause harm when ingested , could remain in the paper and could leak into a cup or mug			2
the industry always insisted that the levels of these chemicals were far too small to pose a health risk			0
but there were concerns that even tiny amounts could be linked to cancer , hormone disorders and developmental problems			0
manufacturers have now replaced chlorine with chlorine dioxide — an agent that produces far fewer toxic by - products — or chlorine - free bleach in the past couple of decades			0
the industry and food regulators say levels are well within safe limits			0
they 're indestructible ! according to the government ’s waste body , @entity226 , tea is the largest element of ‘ avoidable food waste ’ in our dustbins			1
wrap estimates that @entity81 tea drinkers throw out 370,000 tonnes of tea bags and tea leaves each year along with vegetable peelings , onion skins and coffee grinds			1
most of this ends up in landfill sites			0
wrap says the environmental impact of tea bags could easily be reduced if people simply threw the bags on the compost heap or flower beds			1
but it ’s not that simple			0
for while most of a tea bag is made from biodegradable paper , around 20 to 30 per cent is not			2
in order to stop tea bags bursting open in transit or in the cup , many are sealed with a strip of heat - resistant polypropylene plastic			1
that plastic does n’t compost , even after a few years , and gardeners often find these small plastic meshes amid their home - made compost ( along with those non-biodegradable stickers that are found on fresh fruit such as apples )			0
wrap insists that the small amount of plastic in a teabag wo n’t cause any harm to plants and can simply be picked out of the compost heap by hand			0
wrap does , however , recommend that if you wish to speed up the composting process , you should rip open the bags			0
a @entity280 ? for environmental groups such as @entity283 , @entity284 and @entity285 , teabags are some way down their list of priorities			0
these charities certainly have concerns about the way forests are cleared to plant tea bushes , rivers and streams are diverted to irrigate plantations and the terrible working conditions of pickers			0
but their websites do n’t have pages devoted to the @entity106 threat or calls to boycott the @entity41 tea bag			0
in a world where there are genuine environmental problems , anxieties about mostly compostable teabags are misplaced			2
soothing : prince @entity308 , and the rest of us , can continue to enjoy cups of tea with teabags , as they actually reduce waste compared to loose tea leaves if you are concerned about anything when making your 4 o’clock cup of tea , worry about the cost and waste of putting too much water into kettles			1
the government ’s @entity324 worked out that two - thirds of people regularly overfill kettles when making tea			2
a single household could save £ 8 a year on their electricity bill by boiling only the water they needed			0
the savings from one week of careful filling would be enough to power a television for a day			0
and it would slash the @entity81 ’s greenhouse gas emissions			2
in fact , tea bags can actually reduce waste			1
few people making a pot of loose leaf tea measure out the leaves precisely — and many use too much			0
using a pre-filled bag eliminates that problem			0
so when eco-warriors start banging on about tea bags , the best advice is quietly slip out of the room and make yourself a nice , soothing cuppa .			1
