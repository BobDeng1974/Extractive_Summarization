the £ 4billion battle for live tv coverage of the @entity2 is set to be a three - way contest			1
the dominance of @entity5 and @entity6 is likely to be challenged by @entity8 owners @entity9 when bidding for 2016 - 19 closes on friday			1
the fierce competition for the 168 live games per season , which are split into seven packages , could set the price for a single match at an amazing £ 8million			2
there will also be an increase on the current £ 2bn for overseas deals , plus the £ 204m agreed with the @entity18 for @entity19			0
@entity5 are expected to pour all their resources into retaining at least four of their prime first - pick packages and @entity6 will want an increase on their current deal which gives them 38 live games per season			1
@entity28 - based @entity27 , the richest tv network in the world , could also make a bid			1
@entity31 holds aloft the trophy after winning the 2014 @entity2 with @entity33 @entity5 has dominated the showing of live games since the inception of the @entity2 in 1992 who will be bidding in the auction for domestic live rights to the @entity2 ? @entity5 and @entity6 , who currently share coverage , will both be involved again			1
they paid £ 3.018billion between them for the 2013 - 16 rights			1
that is expected to rise for 2016 - 19 , and potentially soar to £ 4bn if other serious bidders enter the auction , such as @entity47 - based giant @entity9 and @entity28 - owned @entity27			1
will @entity5 lose matches this time ? it ’s feasible			1
under the current deals , @entity5 have 116 live games per season , and @entity6 have the other 38 games , for a total of 154 live games per season , which were sold in seven packages			1
the auction for 2016 - 19 also has seven packages for sale but more games overall			0
five packages have 28 games per season and two packages have 14 games			0
about a dozen of the extra games will be shown on friday nights			0
@entity5 have brought @entity68 legend @entity67 ( right ) into their star studded line - up of pundits former @entity73 stars @entity74 and @entity75 ( left ) are part of @entity6 's team potential rival @entity27 have already recruited former @entity5 presenters @entity80 ( left ) and @entity81 any one broadcaster will be allowed a maximum of 126 games per season — or four ‘ big ’ packages plus one ‘ small ’ package			1
that ’s what @entity5 currently has and will want to keep			0
they will almost certainly be willing to pay more than the £ 2.28bn over three years they paid last time			0
but will another major player splash the cash and reduce what @entity5 have ? @entity6 have deep pockets			2
they spent £ 897m on @entity94 and @entity95 live rights for three seasons starting 2015 - 16			1
they wo n’t want less than the 38 @entity2 games they have now and can be expected to bid strongly			1
the real unknown is whether @entity100 and @entity27 will come in with blockbuster bids			0
that could blow the market open and send prices soaring , again			0
who are @entity9 and what personalities might we see on our tvs if a new bidder wins the rights to @entity2 matches ? @entity100 are a @entity47 - based global media company that started in the 1980s with one documentary channel			1
they are now extremely wealthy and own a majority stake in @entity8			0
their chief executive was reportedly in @entity117 last month to meet @entity2 officials for talks about a bid for @entity122 rights			2
if @entity100 win the rights to some matches the assumption is they would show them on @entity8 , which has never televised live @entity2 games			2
they would try to hire or poach established names , possibly from @entity5 or @entity6 if those two lose games			1
@entity27 already have former @entity5 frontmen @entity81 and @entity80 working for them in @entity28			2
@entity6 are expected to increase their share of 38 live games to see players like @entity136 in action @entity2 clubs like leaders @entity140 will get even richer following the new tv deal why is there such fierce competition for @entity2 games ? a generation ago virtually nobody in @entity122 paid to watch tv over and above their licence fee			1
now around 60 per cent of households ( or 16m homes ) pay for a subscription whether @entity5 , @entity152 or @entity6			2
increasingly , the battle between these communications giants is for the ‘ triple play ’ market ( phone , internet and tv from one source ) and the ‘ quad play ’ market ( which adds mobile phones )			0
they want you to get all your services from them			0
live @entity2 matches are being used in an attempt to influence your choice			2
with millions of people paying £ 600 - plus a year for these services , it ’s a massive industry			0
will @entity2 football cost me more from 2016 - 17 ? will i need more subscriptions ? it ’s feasible that @entity5 and @entity6 will share the rights again in broadly the same way they do now , and fans wo n’t notice any difference to pricing			1
but if a third or even fourth broadcaster gets involved more subscriptions will be needed , almost certainly at extra cost			0
although if @entity5 lose a lot of games they may have to reduce prices to keep customers			1
if another broadcaster enters the arena , tv fans may find they have to pay for another subscription @entity193 will get a large share of the expected £ 7bn pot created by selling broadasting rights will the clubs get richer ? oh yes			2
the total broadcasting pot for the 2013 - 16 period was more than £ 5.5bn , mostly from domestic live rights ( £ 3.018bn ) and foreign rights ( £ 2.23bn ) with highlights , near - live rights and mobile rights on top			1
the 2016 - 19 total pot is expected to be close to £ 7bn with £ 4bn from domestic rights			2
the vast bulk of the cash will end up being split among the @entity2 clubs			0
@entity2 fans are not expected to see a reduction in ticket prices following the sale will ticket prices go down ? you ’re having a laugh , are n’t you ? almost certainly not and not by much in any case			0
many @entity2 games are sold out or nearly sold out , even though ticket prices are the most expensive in the world			0
while the demand is there , clubs will charge what they can			0
the only rider to that is that the @entity2 hierarchy would like to see clubs offer more cheap deals , particularly to away fans and younger people			0
it remains possible that an increase in tv money will allow more subsidies for schemes like this ... but do n’t bank on it .			0

broadcasters will bid for tv rights of @entity2 matches on friday
the £ 3.01bn for 2013 - 16 rights paid by @entity5 and @entity6 is expected to rise
@entity5 could lose games following competition from the likes of @entity27 and @entity9
