the company , which sells everything from books to bread , said it paid just £ 2.44million in corporation tax on @entity16 sales of £ 320million last year			1
but the @entity18 - based group told its investors that it actually made 13 times this amount , claiming the @entity16 sales were actually more than £ 4billion			1

’ last night , she said : ‘ we will now consider whether we need to recall them to explain that discrepancy			0
