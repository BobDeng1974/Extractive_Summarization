it 's showtime for @entity1			1
@entity4 's @entity3 spacecraft has travelled three billion miles and is nearing the end of its nine - year journey to the dwarf planet			1
and on sunday it will begin photographing the mysterious , unexplored , icy world			0
the first pictures will reveal little more than bright dots - @entity3 is still more than 100 million miles from @entity1			1
there remain many unanswered questions about @entity1			2
the @entity3 probe ( artist 's impression pictured ) hopes to provide some answers when it flies by the dwarf planet on july 15 , 2015 but the images , taken against star fields , will help scientists gauge the remaining distance and keep the grand piano - sized robot on track for a july flyby			1
it is humanity 's first trip to @entity1 , and scientists are eager to start exploring			1
' @entity3 has been a mission of delayed gratification in many respects , and it 's finally happening now , ' said project scientist @entity34 of @entity36 's @entity35			2
' it 's going to be a sprint for the next seven months , basically , to the finish line , ' he said friday			0
' we ca n't wait to turn @entity1 into a real world , instead of just a little pixelated blob			2
' this combination of images made by the @entity45 in 2002 and 2003 shows @entity1 at different angles			2
@entity4 's @entity3 spacecraft is nearing the end of its nine - year voyage to @entity1 launched from @entity50 in january 2006 on a $ 700 million mission , @entity3 awoke from its last hibernation period early last month			1
flight controllers have spent the past several weeks getting the spacecraft ready for the final but most important leg of its journey			0
' we have been working on this project , some people , for over a quarter of their careers , to make this mission happen , ' said project manager @entity63 of the @entity35 , ' and now we 're about to hit the mother lode			0
' the spacecraft 's long - range reconnaissance imager will take hundreds of pictures of @entity1 over the coming months			1
it snapped pictures last summer , before going into hibernation , but these new ones should be considerably brighter			0
as @entity3 travelled towards @entity1 , it captured the dwarf planet locked in a mesmerising dance with its largest moon , @entity76			1
the @entity3 spacecraft took the footage as it raced through space to rendezvous with the dwarf planet in 2015			2
the 12 images that make up the animation were taken from a distance ranging from 267 million to 262 million miles ( 429 million to 422 million km )			0
put together , the footage covers @entity1 and almost one full rotation of its largest moon , @entity76 , which orbits 11,200 miles ( about 18,000km ) above the dwarf planet 's surface			1
@entity76 is almost half the size of @entity1			2
the moon is so big that @entity1 and @entity76 are sometimes referred to as a double dwarf planet system			2
the mission team are now using the footage - which focuses on @entity1 's position against a backdrop of stars â€“ to fine - tune the distance that @entity3 will fly past @entity1 and its moons			1
@entity1 's four smaller satellites are too faint to be seen in these distant images , but will begin to appear in images taken next year as the spacecraft speeds closer to its target			0
it will be a few days before the new images are beamed back to @entity103 ; scientists expect to release them publicly in early february			0
by may , @entity3 ' photos should equal and then surpass the ones taken by the @entity45 , with pictures of the plutoid and its moons improving with each passing day			1
the real payoff will come when @entity3 flies by @entity1 on july 14 at a distance of 7,700 miles and speed of nearly 31,000 mph			1
it will whip past @entity76 , @entity1 's largest moon , from 18,000 miles out			1
scientists have no idea , really , what @entity1 looks like way out in the @entity119 beyond @entity121 's orbit			1
@entity1 is the biggest object in the @entity119			1
together with mega-moon , @entity76 , roughly half @entity1 's size , the two orbs could fit inside the @entity126 with room to spare			0
five moons have been found so far around @entity1			0
more could be lurking out there , awaiting discovery by @entity3			0
this is one of the clearest images obtained of @entity1 and its moon @entity76 by the @entity45 the @entity35 in @entity133 , @entity134 , designed and built @entity3 , and is now managing the mission for @entity4			1
@entity1 was still officially a planet , no. 9 in the solar system lineup , when @entity3 departed @entity103			1
it was the only planet in our solar system yet to be explored			0
but seven months later , the @entity141 stripped @entity1 of its planethood , classifying it instead as a dwarf planet			1
later came the term , plutoid			0
some scientists are hoping @entity1 's upcoming close - up - and expected cosmic buzz - may prompt the group to reverse its decision			2
the nature of science , after all , is fluid , as even the astronomical union maintains			0
@entity154 , @entity156 - hometown of @entity1 's discoverer , the late astronomer @entity153 - already has declared 2015 the ' year of @entity1			0
' @entity153 spotted @entity1 in 1930			0
@entity3 may , indeed , ' turn the tide in some people 's opinions into the other camp , ' @entity34 said			0
' but that 's not really so important			0
' more important , he said , is finding out ' what does @entity1 really look like			0
' the @entity166 's probe , seen above in this artist 's impression , will use miniature cameras , radio science experiment , ultraviolet and infrared spectrometers to study the geology of @entity1 and its moon @entity76			2

@entity3 probe has travelled three billion miles over nine years
first pictures , to arrive next week , will reveal little more than bright dots
but they could help keep @entity3 probe on track for a july flyby
scientists still have no idea what @entity1 looks like in the @entity119
@entity189 will take hundreds of pictures of @entity1 over the coming months
