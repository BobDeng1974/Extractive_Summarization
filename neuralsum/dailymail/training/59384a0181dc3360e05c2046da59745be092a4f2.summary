the petition reads : ' a friend and amazing young girl , our @entity5 has had her life cut short after experiencing symptoms for over a year and being in horrendous pain and even asking for a smear			2
' but because of her age - 19 - she was refused time and time again and now she has terminal cervical cancer			1
' out of loads of doctors , it took that one to say " we will check you properly " , but then it was too late			0
' our @entity5 has been failed in the worst way , and i need 500,000 signatures to be heard , one million to get this changed hopefully			0
' to view the petition and add your support for the campaign , go to : submissions.epetitions.direct.gov.uk / petitions / 62385 screening : the test is currently offered to women aged 25 or over the @entity51 offers a free cervical screening test to all women aged 25 - 64 every three to five years			1
it is not a test for cervical cancer , but it identifies early abnormalities which , if left untreated , could develop into cancer of the cervix ( neck of the womb )			2
a sample of cells is taken from the cervix for analysis and sent to a laboratory for analysis			0
those whose cells show abnormalities are called back for further investigation and , if necessary , treatment			0
currently the test is not offered routinely to women aged younger than 25 because cervical cancer is so rare in women that young			1
according to @entity118 statistics , not a single woman under the age of 20 died from cervical cancer between 2009 - 2011			2
the lower age of 25 was raised from 20 after the @entity216 on @entity217 ( @entity218 ) advised the @entity51 in 2003 that cervical screening in younger women did more harm than good			1
the committee advised that cell abnormalities in younger women normally went away of their own accord , and said that sending young women for further tests and treatment increased the likelihood of the woman having pre-term delivery if she went on to have children , and could cause significant anxiety			0
many other countries offer cervical screening from the age of 25 , including @entity234 , @entity235 , @entity236 and @entity237			2
in @entity239 , women are invited to be checked from the age of 20 , though it is due to go up to 25 next year			0
in @entity242 women are invited from 18 , @entity243 from 20 , and in the @entity245 two years after women become sexually active			0
meanwhile , other countries start cervical screening later			2
both the @entity248 and @entity249 offer screening to women only once they are 30 , and these two countries boast some of the lowest mortality rates for cervical cancer in @entity255 , and in @entity257 it is for women over 31 .			1
