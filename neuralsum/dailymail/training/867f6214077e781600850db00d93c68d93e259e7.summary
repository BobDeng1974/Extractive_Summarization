by @entity1 reporter published : 14:21 est , 12 january 2013 updated : 02:54 est , 13 january 2013 a man abducted by his grandparents at the age of five lives next door to them with his new wife and is preparing to be a father himself			1
the impression of a close and happy family life was emerging in the case of @entity13 , now 24 , who was kidnapped by his grandparents as a young child			1
police found the grandparents and @entity17 almost 19 years after he went missing in an operation , praised by his parents , @entity20 and @entity21 , who had almost given up hope of seeing him again			1
but both @entity17 and his new wife have praised rather than criticized his parents			1
in a @entity28 post @entity26 said his grandparents kept her husband ' safe ' as a child			1
baby : @entity17 and his wife @entity32 , pictured left , are now expecting their own child and have posted ultrasound images and messages about how excited they are on @entity28 , pictured right ' his " grandparents " did n't follow the law , but they did what was right			1
sometimes , our @entity42 laws do n't help or protect the people they should			0
he remembers his birth parents and what they were like , ' it said			0
' he had been living under his grandparents care since he was a 6 month old baby			2
he was where he wanted and needed to be to be safe and become the man he is today , my husband and best friend			0
' rather than the appearance of someone held against his will , @entity17 , who changed his name to @entity17 himself at age 18 , has defended the grandparents who kidnapped and raised him			1
he is now preparing to be a father himself with his wife @entity32 , who has two sons from a previous relationship			1
they all live on one plot of land in @entity68 , just outside @entity69 , @entity70 and the young couple have been happily posting on @entity28 about the upcoming birth of their child			1
in one post @entity32 writes : ' @entity76 had a girls name picked out since he was younger so i feel like that 's a sign too ... he wants a lil tomgirl and having 2 boys , i ca n't really see myself having a girly girl ... ca n't wait till we can find out ! ' they are clearly close to @entity17 grandparents who live alongside them under the aliases @entity87 and @entity88 rather @entity89 and @entity90 as they were called at the time of the abduction			1
new man : pictured outside his home in @entity69 , @entity70 @entity94 faced reporters as a 24 - year - old overwhelmed : @entity17 has been shocked by the reaction to his case			1
his wife , @entity101 , pictured left , is pregnant and both have defended his grandparents who abducted him @entity105 has worked since 1999 as a herdsman at @entity107 in nearby @entity108 , where owner @entity109 described him as a ' dedicated , faithful ' employee			1
@entity109 said he was in shock when he read a story about the case			0
he said @entity87 plays guitar at his church , and recalled a day last summer when the couple brought their instruments to play for dairy workers			2
he said he knew @entity120 slightly , saying he stopped in occasion - perhaps to drop off @entity87 ' lunch if he had forgotten it			0
' ( @entity17 ) works at an auto parts place			1
that fits him perfectly , because @entity125 is kind of a motorhead and @entity17 is the same way , ' @entity109 said			1
but behind the image of a close and happy family living in a small town , the couple had a secret which has now been revealed			2
@entity17 ' grandparents fled with five - year - old @entity13 during a custody dispute with his mother , @entity20 in july 1994 from @entity137 , @entity138			1
his parents obtained custody after @entity20 moved into a group home that could not accommodate children according to an attorney for @entity17 ' mother , @entity163			1
after a while , she moved into an apartment and gained custody of her son on weekends , and she filed a petition to expand her custody rights when she remarried , he said ' the judge gave her custody on a trial basis , and before she could get him , that 's when they left , ' @entity163 added			0
he said the grandparents withdrew $ 5,000 out of a home equity line , went out for breakfast and left town			1
' the trail on this case went cold the day they disappeared			0
there was no trace of them after they left the restaurant , ' he said			0
the grandparents were charged with misdemeanor interference with custody , which was bumped up to a felony in 1999			2
but the charge was dismissed in 2008 after the case went cold			0
investigators reopened the case in september after a conversation between @entity196 , @entity20 's new partner , and an @entity199 detective who attended the same church prompted another search of @entity17 ' social security number			2
that turned up a man with the same number and birthday with an address in @entity68			0
@entity199 then contacted @entity70 law enforcement agencies , which began investigating along with the @entity209 and the @entity210			0
family home : @entity17 lives next to the grandparents who adopted him in @entity70 with his wife better off : in a @entity28 posting by a man claiming to be him , @entity17 writes his grandparents having been ' in the right ' for taking him from his life with his mother at the age of five - investigator @entity221 sheriff @entity222 said the case will now be forwarded to federal authorities for possible charges			1
@entity226 , pictured for the first time outside the family plot on friday , defended his grandparents although it is not clear how much of his back - story he was told			1
in a posting , believed to be a message from @entity17 ' @entity28 account to the @entity235 television station @entity234 's @entity28 page he said they did well be him			2
' for you people who jump to conclusions you should find out the whole story i was where i needed to be			0
my ` grandparents ' were in the the right i do n't care what anyone else thinks , ' he says			2
according to court records , @entity17 applied for the name change himself in november 2006			2
the application does n't say why he requested the change			0
other witnesses from the time have also defended the grandparents			2
@entity221 , who spent several months investigating the disappearance with the @entity255 in @entity138 , said @entity17 ' mother and stepfather were unemployed and lived in a car at the time			1
overjoyed : @entity21 has spoken of his relief that his son has been found			0
he says he hopes to re-establish contact with both his son and his parents vanished : in 1994 @entity265 disappeared at the age of five from @entity137 , @entity138 before he was found 19 years later at the age of 24 living in @entity70 ' these people ( the grandparents ) were nice people			1
it was wrong for them to do it , but i can understand why , ' @entity221 said			0
' but i also did n't think the child would be in any danger at all with them			2
' @entity20 's attorney has refuted the claims and said she spent only three days living in a car and it was with @entity17 ' biological father			1
both parents said they were delighted following the news that their son had been found			0
@entity196 said his wife was ' the happiest woman on earth ' on hearing the news he was found			0
' we always just kept it in the back of our minds that we believed we were going to see him again , ' said @entity21 , who was speaking to @entity234 after hearing the news			0
' until i get to actually walk up and say hello to him again , i do n't know if it 's going to be real , ' he added			0
he has also said that he hopes to re-establish contact with his parents			0
a spokeswoman with the @entity42 attorney 's office in @entity70 , @entity299 , said charges in such a case could be related to non-custodial kidnapping , whether the child was exploited , abused , trafficked or being used to obtain benefits			2
the small town is buzzing with the news			0
@entity307 , a retired jeweler , said some residents speculated that some people knew of @entity17 ' history but kept quiet			2
he said it was the most notable news since a grisly triple homicide there in 2003			0
' my grandson called last night and said , ` @entity68 made the news again , ' @entity307 said			0

@entity13 taken from @entity138 home by his *paternal* grandparents in 1994 is pictured for the first time as an adult calling himself @entity17
