@entity17 stockbroker , @entity0 , ( pictured with baby @entity8 in 1994 ) never gave up hope of finding his kidnapped daughter who became the subject of an @entity21 international manhunt the only father she knew : @entity8 ( left ) thought her name was @entity25 and that @entity26 was her natural father			1
she is pictured here with @entity26 , her half brother , @entity31 , and mother , whose real name is @entity33 ' his daughter thus far has been reluctant to meet , ' @entity0 's lawyer , @entity34 , told the @entity36			1
' she only knows her mother and the misinformation that has been provided her			0
she likely would be considered by her mother to be disloyal if she were to meet [ @entity0 ] at this time			0
' as @entity41 faces an extradition hearing in a @entity44 court and possible immediate immigration detention as early as next week ahead of deportation to the @entity7 , @entity40 fears jeopardising his hoped for reunion with his daughter			1
but mr @entity48 said @entity0 yearned for the ' long awaited opportunity ' of meeting @entity8			2
he had literally counted the days - 19 years , six months and 12 days - from the access visit on which @entity8 disappeared with her mother , to when @entity5 police knocked on a door in a beachside suburb and arrested @entity41 for abduction			1
the @entity57 - educated , softly spoken @entity56 gentleman has refused to speak with the media about the daughter he spent endless hours and a considerable amount of his fortune on a worldwide search for her			0
the extraordinary story of how @entity41 eluded the @entity21 for two decades , and how her life as a lie unravelled , is said to have ' deeply confused ' 20 - year - old @entity8			1
until the day federal @entity7 charges of child abduction and passport fraud were laid against her mother last november , the young nursing student believed her name was @entity25 and the recently deceased @entity26 - really her stepfather - was her biological parent			0
@entity33 's friends have launched a campaign against @entity40 , telling the @entity76 's @entity75 he had wanted @entity41 to terminate her pregnancy with @entity8 in 1993			1
@entity8 ( left ) , who only learnt her real name three months ago is said to be ' deeply confused ' about the fact her mother kidnapped her and is ' reluctant ' to meet @entity40 , the father ( right ) she never knew friends of @entity81 ( left , with daughter @entity8 ) have llaunched a campaign against @entity8 's real father , @entity40 , calling him ' evil ' one friend described @entity0 as an ' evil , evil man ' while @entity41 herself described his pursuit of her as ' corrupt ' and ' criminal '			1
details have emerged about the doomed relationship between the quite classical music lover , @entity0 , the son of a nurse and a doctor from @entity93 , and @entity41 , who was raised by a single mother and stepfather on welfare			2
@entity0 spent his career working at financial management company @entity98 in @entity17 , @entity99			0
@entity41 ran a piggery in @entity101 , a jewellery business in @entity103 , finally settling for a job as a flight attendant before meeting @entity0 and marrying him in a whirlwind romance			2
when the marriage failed , and @entity0 gained custody of @entity110 after a court case which alleged @entity41 was bipolar , she was awarded only supervised access to her daughter			1
it was on one of these visits @entity41 and 11 - month - old @entity8 disappeared and embarked on their lives as fugitives , travelling to @entity119 , @entity120 , and @entity103 where @entity41 married @entity26 and had a son			2
the couple emigrated to @entity123 , where they gained citizenship , and then @entity41 and her children moved to @entity5 's @entity128 , where they were known as @entity130 , @entity25 and @entity131			1
it was over evening drinks after a day 's sailing in 2011 that @entity41 slipped up			0
she referred to @entity25 as ' @entity110 ' and said she had fled an ' abusive ' relationship in @entity7			0
@entity41 's @entity103 friends went online and found a page on the @entity139 for missing and @entity141 's website			2
@entity8 ( pictured as a toddler ) has only known @entity26 ( right ) as her father , causing ' deep confusion ' about her real identity they saw pictures of a woman who looked like a younger ' @entity149 ' and an age - advanced photo of a girl who resembled @entity25			2
they contacted @entity40 in @entity7			0
his long hunt for @entity8 was over			0
@entity34 said @entity40 ' never quit ' looking for his daughter			0
' for years he updated her room to be age appropriate and would record a video message to her there on her birthdays , ' @entity48 said			0
' it is a parent 's worst nightmare not to know what happened to a child [ but ] he never lost hope and pursued every possibility that might lead to her recovery			0
' it is believed @entity33 does not hold @entity5 citizenship and risks detention should she be granted bail from @entity172			0
a hearing in @entity176 will determine whether she is ' eligible for surrender ' to the @entity7 , after which the federal attorney general will decide whether to give @entity41 over to @entity7 authorities			0
if @entity41 loses an appeal against extradition , she will be deported to the @entity7 and imprisoned in a federal correctional facility until she faces court over the alleged kidnapping and passport charges , for which she could serve more than 20 years if convicted .			1
