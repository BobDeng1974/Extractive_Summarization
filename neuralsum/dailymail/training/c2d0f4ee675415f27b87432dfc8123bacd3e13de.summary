pregnant would - be glamour model @entity1 has told how she was so disappointed when she found out she was expecting a third boy , she drowned her sorrows in wine and cigarettes			1
the 24 - year - old mother of two , whose baby is due in october , said she smoked a whole packet of cigarettes and drank one glass of wine after the other because she felt ' genuinely gutted ' to discover it was n't the little girl she 'd hoped for			2
and she admitted that she would n't have done it if she 'd been carrying a girl			0
deep down i know i would n't be smoking or drinking if i knew i was having a girl			0
' she said she was now smoking 20 a day			0
her controversial comments came after she said she wanted to pay the @entity36 back for her boob job , not out of a sense of duty but in an attempt to stop people confronting her			2
miss @entity1 , who has sold tickets to watch her give birth to her third child in october for a total of £ 30,000 , insisted her £ 4,800 breast enlargement was medically necessary			1
but she told @entity48 hosts @entity18 and @entity20 that she intended to give the money back to taxpayers , who also footed the £ 6,000 bill for the taxis that miss @entity1 took on the school run , in an attempt to deflect vitriol from strangers			1
she said : ' i do want to pay back the @entity36 not because i feel i have to - because like i say , i have a medical condition - but because i just want people to back off			1
' pregnant : miss @entity1 said she suffered from ' severe anxiety ' which meant she could n't take the bus miss @entity1 , who lives in @entity23 , said her breast operation was needed because she had ' no breast tissue at all '			1
and she said she needed taxis for the school run rather than taking the bus because she feared abuse from strangers			0
the mother of boys aged six and three , who said she had worked from the age of 15 , said : ' i got my taxi funded by @entity76 for a short period because i 'm suffering with severe anxiety , which is something a lot of people go through			0
' this anxiety stems from me raising my children on my own ... it comes from my fear of people confronting me in front of my children			0
' today she said her decision to sell tickets so people could watch her give birth was better than ' sitting at home and claiming benefits ' and said : ' it 's not much different to [ reality labour ward show ] one born every minute			2
hard talk : the @entity48 hosts quizzed miss @entity1 about why she had become so unpopular ' they 'll not be sat down there with a camera - i will have someone for protection			1
' and when asked by @entity18 why ' people hate you ' , she said blamed her aspiration to become a glamour model			2
' i think it 's not because i had my breasts done on the @entity36 but because of my career path - i aspire to be a glamour model , ' she said			1
' any woman growing up with no breast tissue is going to want to get them out for anyone			0
' she also said that her baby 's father would not be at the birth , saying that ' we speak [ but ] we 're not really in a good place at the moment			0
' during an # @entity122 session on @entity124 last night , the 24 - year - old from @entity23 who is best known for having a breast enlargement on the @entity36 , had to defend herself against furious strangers angry about her use of public money			1
one accused @entity131 , a mother of two who is expecting her third child in october , of wasting @entity36 funds , while another accused her of ' failing @entity136 '			2
@entity1 , 23 , who sold tickets to watch the birth of her third child , faced abuse on @entity124 last night not happy : this angry tweet to @entity131 was typical of those sent during the # @entity143 session the angry tweets poured forth all night , but miss @entity1 barely managed to answer more than a dozen miss @entity1 started the session last night with the tweet : ' sorry guys , today 's been manic			1
get your questions in and i 'll do # @entity152 in the next 25 minutes ( 10pm ) sorry it 's later than expected ! ' she was then asked : ' we have a 30min drive to our nearest @entity155			0
do you think the money wasted on you could be spent better ? answers : a ) yes or b ) yes '			0
miss @entity1 replied : ' money was n't wasted on me , i had a medical condition			1
' another said : ' how does it feel to know you make so many people feel angry on a daily basis ? ' you have failed @entity136 ... well done			0
' and another tweeted : ' why do people like you get so much attention and money spent on you when people are struggling to live because of poverty ? ' miss @entity1 had no answer for that one			1
the scale of the vitriol was influenced by @entity131 's decision earlier this week to sell four tickets to watch her give birth at home , which she said had sold out in 14 minutes , raising £ 30,000			1
miss @entity1 was accused of ' wasting ' public money but insisted her boob job was medically necessary yesterday morning , miss @entity1 announced to her 27,000 @entity124 followers that tickets for her home birth had sold out in 14 minutes			1
three of the four tickets were apparently purchased by journalists , while the fourth is said to have been bought by a ' super-fan ' named @entity188			2
mr @entity189 , who spent his savings on the ticket , told closer : ' i 've followed @entity1 since she came into the public eye			2
it 'll be great to say i was at the birth			0
' this tweet boasting about making money from charging people to watch her give birth prompted vitriol two people are said to have paid £ 10,000 each , while mr @entity205 and one other paid £ 5,000 for their ringside seats			1
the more expensive tickets will enable the holders , said to be journalists , to film the birth and take photos , while the cheaper ones will include travel and accommodation			0
a spokesman for @entity131 insisted ticket - holders would be vetted to ensure no - one ' dodgy ' was admitted			0
miss @entity1 has suggested that she might use some of the money to repay the @entity36 for her breast operation			1
miss @entity1 became a household name when she admitted undergoing £ 4,800 worth of breast enhancement surgery paid by the @entity36 to increase her bust from a @entity222 to @entity223			1
she claimed she needed the surgery because she had been bullied since the age of 14 for being flat chested			0
later it emerged that she received @entity227 on the @entity36 over a ' sweat problem '			0
she courted further publicity when she said she was considering aborting the child she is now pregnant with so that she could take part in the @entity233 reality tv show			0
never one to shy away from controvery , miss @entity1 has built her career on winding people up miss @entity1 later said she was receiving negative attention on public transport and asked the council to provide her with a £ 6,000 - a - year taxi to take her children to school			1
eventually @entity76 decided to axe the service , which prompted ms @entity1 to @entity124 : ‘ sticks and stones may break my bones but taxpayers will always fund me			2
’ she said : ' if the council think i ’m getting a bus , they can think again			0
' initially , miss @entity1 had planned to cash in on the birth of her son by selling dvds of the event through a chain of pound shops .			2
