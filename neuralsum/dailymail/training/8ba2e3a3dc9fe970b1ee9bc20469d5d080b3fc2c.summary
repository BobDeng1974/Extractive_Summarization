@entity1 , they may be			0
but electric cars have struggled to overcome one of the main shortfalls that put buyers off - an inferior range to their petrol - powered rivals			2
that may be about to change after a new electric car was unveiled that promises to go 500 miles ( 800km ) before the battery needs recharging			2
this would be far more than one of the current leaders in the field , the battery / gasoline @entity17 , which can do around 375 miles ( 600km ) on one charge - up			2
going the distance : the @entity21 electric car which promises to go 500 miles before the battery needs recharging on the horizon : a battery / fuel cell demonstration model of the @entity21 is expected to arrive sometime in 2013 the @entity26 concept ( @entity27 ) , created by three @entity29 companies , uses bio-methanol to bolster its battery life			1
@entity34 , ceo of @entity35 , designers of the innovative ' @entity21 ' car said bio-methanol was far better than diesel or gasoline because it produces substantially less carbon dioxide			1
' in combination with the way we built the car , which is really lightweight ( 425 kilograms ) , we can get the 500 - mile range , ' he told @entity45			0
a bio-methanol / water is converted by the fuel cell to create electricity , while waste heat from the process powers the car 's heating and cooling system			0
one right royal potential owner : prince @entity57 has a look inside one of @entity61 's electric concept cars during a visit to @entity29 earlier this year keen interest : prince @entity57 and @entity64 were both given the low - down on the new designs when they visited @entity68 in may it also benefits from a innovative chassis design which has really pushed the technology forward			1
' instead of putting in a fixed battery , we have built in ( six ) modules that can be fitted inside the chassis			1
we can use battery power in the modules or any other kind of energy source , ' @entity34 said			2
the award - winning @entity21 also uses patented in - wheel electric motors to deliver a top speed of 75mph ( 120kph )			1
the car caught the attention of royalty earlier this year when prince @entity57 and @entity64 paid a visit to @entity29			0
driver : a novel chassis design means it will contain six electric modules rather then a single fixed battery imminent : the @entity21 project hopes to launch a battery - powered model with a range of 186 miles this year they both climbed into the @entity21 car when they arrived at @entity68 in may			1
mr @entity97 , introduced the e-car and its many features , while the royal couple listened attentively			0
prince @entity57 promised to follow @entity35 in the future and said that he finds the @entity103 - concept very interesting			0
' this is indeed a fantastic opportunity for us to spread the message about @entity61 and our e-car @entity21 to a wider audience ' , he said			0
according to @entity111 from @entity112 , the designers of the fuel cell , bio-methanol is a cheap and abundant fuel with a short carbon chain			0
challenging petrol : the award - winning @entity21 also uses patented in - wheel electric motors to deliver a top speed of 75mph ( 120kph ) green machine : the car 's fuel cell converts a bio-ethanol / water mix into electricity to power the battery compared to gasoline , bio-methanol production can cut co2 emissions by more than 70 per cent the @entity129 @entity128 ( @entity130 ) says direct methanol fuel cells are not hampered by the storage problems that affect other green fuels like hydrogen because as a liquid it 's easier to transport and supply through current infrastructure			1
the @entity21 project hopes to launch a battery - powered model with a range of 186 miles ( 300 kilometers ) later this year			1
the battery / fuel cell version is expected to arrive sometime in 2013 .			0

@entity21 concept *vehicle* uses bio-methanol to boost its battery life
novel chassis contains six modules instead of one fixed battery
innovative in - wheel electric motors can deliver top speed of 75mph
