@entity0 are ready to revive their interest in @entity2 as they continue their quest to find a new left - back			0
@entity2 has been on @entity0 ’s radar for more than 12 months and they came close to sign him in the january window but he ultimately ended up joining @entity7 on loan			2
trying to conclude a deal , however , will be far from straightforward as @entity10 are reluctant to do business with a side they now regard as credible title rivals and they would be looking for a fee in excess of £ 8million			1
@entity37 had his heart set on a move to @entity45 but @entity38 have been difficult to deal with and refused to budge from their valuation of £ 16m , forcing @entity0 – who are trying to close a loan deal for @entity28 right - back @entity27 – to look elsewhere			1
@entity27 will join a two - year loan with view to a £ 4.5m transfer .			0

@entity54 first tried to sign @entity2 in january
@entity10 are reluctant to sell to title rival and would want £ 8million
@entity0 *failed* to sign @entity58 who has now joined @entity31
@entity38 are refusing to accept less than £ 16m for @entity37
