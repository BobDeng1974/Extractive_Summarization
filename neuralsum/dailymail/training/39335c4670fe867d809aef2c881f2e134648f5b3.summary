by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 20:37 est , 18 september 2013 updated : 01:52 est , 19 september 2013 decision : @entity5 chairman @entity4 announced that the progression towards a stronger economy is taking longer than originally expected @entity8 had their best day hitting record highs on wednesday after the @entity5 announced that they would continue to support the economy by keeping interest rates high and buying billions of government bonds			1
@entity15 stocks jumped as a result with traders predicting that the fact that the central bank will continue pumping $ 85billion into the economy every month could lead to inflation			1
the announcement of the continued financial support came as a major surprise , as many believed the @entity5 would begin winding down their emergency measures that were initially launched five years ago during the financial collapse			1
@entity5 chairman @entity4 said on wednesday that wanted to wait for more evidence of solid economic growth before beginning to reduce the country ’s bond purchases			1
he went out of his way to stress the program was ' not on a pre-set course ’ even though in june he had said the @entity5 expected to cut back before year end			1
' there is no fixed calendar schedule			0
i really have to emphasize that , ' he told a news conference			0
‘ if the data confirm our basic outlook , if we gain more confidence in that outlook ... then we could move later this year			0
' the reaction in markets was swift and sharp : the @entity15 dollar fell to a seven - month low against major currencies and the price of gold , a traditional inflation hedge , soared more than 4.0 per cent and investors responded by propelling @entity15 stocks to record highs and driving down bond yields			1
yields on @entity60 debt had risen over the summer on expectations the @entity5 would cut back its $ 85billion a month in bond purchases that have been the cornerstone of its efforts to spur the economy			2
share price rise : @entity15 s&p500 index shot up 15.66 points to 1720.42 , the highest level in its history and the @entity72 rose 108.09 to a record 15,637.82 some economists said it was possible the @entity5 might not begin to wind down its bond buying until after @entity4 's term as @entity5 chairman expires in january			1
her task : @entity81 is seen to be the frontrunner in the fight to take over from @entity4 when he leaves in january that would leave the tricky task of unwinding the stimulus to his successor , quite possibly @entity5 vice chair @entity81 who was identified by a @entity90 official on wednesday as the front - runner for the job			2
@entity4 declined to comment on his own future , beyond saying he hoped to have more information soon			0
@entity4 had stated in june that officials expected to begin slowing the pace of bond purchases later this year and would likely end the program by mid- 2014 , at which point the central bank forecast the unemployment rate would be around 7.0 per cent			0
in his statement on wednesday , he said a jobless rate of 7.0 per cent was not a ' magic number ' that would govern when the @entity5 would turn off the monetary spigot			2
' we could begin later this year			0
but even if we do that , the subsequent steps will be dependent on continued progress in the economy , ' @entity4 said			0
' we do n't have a fixed calendar schedule			2
but we do have the same basic framework that i described in june			0

chairman of @entity5 says that it is n't time to stop using the emergency measures put in place during the financial collapse
