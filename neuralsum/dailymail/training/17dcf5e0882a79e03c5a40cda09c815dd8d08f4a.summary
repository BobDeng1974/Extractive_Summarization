@entity0 has defended a @entity2 official who said it was the party of ' bigots ' as he was left reeling from the defection of a top mep to the conservatives			1
the @entity2 leader hit out at the party 's former communities spokesman @entity9 after his defection to join @entity13 's party			1
but he refused to condemn @entity2 party secretary @entity14 saying that @entity2 should represent ' bigots ' and labelling the @entity16 a ' waste of money '			1
in a stinging parting short , mr @entity9 said he decided to leave @entity2 because it ' has become a vanity project for @entity0 and because many of the criticisms made of the party are true '			1
in an article for the @entity40 , he said he had ' experienced racism in @entity2 ' and accused mr @entity0 of e runs running the party ' like a dictator , employs people who are totally inappropriate for party positions and gets rid of anybody who stands in his way '			1
in an attempt to play down the defection , mr @entity0 said @entity2 had become ' increasingly alarmed ' about allegations of impropriety against mr @entity9			1
he claimed the @entity53 ' did n't tell us the truth ' about the alleged employment of illegal immigrants in his restaurant business and there are ' some big open questions in @entity61 about money '			0
there were also claims of interference in candidate selection in @entity67 , @entity68 and links with ' political extremists ' from @entity71			0
mr @entity9 has strongly denied the accusations made by @entity2 since his decision to quit			1
in a fresh blow to @entity2 , it emerged mr @entity14 had made a series of damaging public remarks			1
the party secretary – who , ironically , was hired to stamp out negative media stories about @entity2 – said : ' people talk about @entity2 being bigots but there are hundreds of thousands of bigots in the @entity31 and they deserve representation			1
' @entity2 party secretary @entity14 , hired to stamp out negative media stories about @entity2 , said : ' people talk about @entity2 being bigots but there are hundreds of thousands of bigots in the @entity31 and they deserve representation ' mr @entity0 refused to condemn the extraordinary comments , which mr @entity14 has suggested was pub ' banter			1
mr @entity0 told @entity92 's @entity91 show : ' there were people in a pub having a drink			2
if you expect me to ban all @entity2 officials from going into pubs , from laughing and smirking and joking , it 's not going to happen			2
' meanwhile , footage emerged from 2010 of mr @entity14 attacking the health service at events in the @entity104			2
speaking at the @entity106 conference in @entity107 he said : ' when i was younger a trillion was an astronomic number			0
now when i look at our national deficits , and your national deficits , actually it is an economic number			0
' a number i could n't possible imagine when i was younger is now the amount of money that is owed by my country , and soon more than that by your country , to other countries , paying for wasteful socialist programmes			0
and of course at the heart of this , the @entity123 bunker of socialism is the @entity127			1
' at the @entity129 in the same year he said : ' this socialist government wastes money like you ca n't imagine			0
they have started doing every wasteful scheme under the sun ... the biggest waste of money of course in the @entity31 is the @entity16 , the @entity127			1
' mr @entity0 , who has advocated an insurance - funded model for the @entity16 in the past , insisted @entity2 was committed to a health service that was free at the point of delivery			1
@entity9 , left , with @entity2 party leader @entity0 , right , before his defection to the @entity21 but he said the service was struggling because of the ' massive increase ' in the country 's population			1
he called for measures to crack down on health tourism and said people studying for medical subjects should be exempt from tuition fees to reduce the @entity16 's reliance on migrant workers			2
he said : ' we want the @entity16 to be better run , we want it to be more efficient			2
we think it 's ludicrous that middle management has grown by 48 % , we think the fact that health tourism is costing gbp2 billion a year is wrong and the fact that one in five new nurses being taken on have to come from abroad says to us ' let 's make sure there are no tuition fees for people who are taking medical degrees '			0
' we want a @entity127 that is free at the point of delivery and funded through taxation			0
' but the one thing nobody dares say is the reason we have an @entity16 crisis right now is because of a massive increase in the population in this country			2
' @entity9 : ' i have decided to leave @entity2 because it has become a vanity project for @entity0 ' i have decided to leave @entity2 because it has become a vanity project for @entity0 and because many of the criticisms made of the party are true			1
@entity13 famously said that @entity2 was a party of ‘ fruitcakes , loonies and closet racists ’			1
certainly , i have experienced racism in @entity2			2
i have been racially abused on social media by other @entity2 members who ask offensive questions like : ‘ are you a @entity196 ? ’ i was angry when i was the only @entity2 politician who was cut out of a video of speeches at a party event			1
i complained that it was because of my ethnic minority background , but was fobbed off			0
some of the antics of @entity2 @entity53 are appalling			2
they make childish remarks during debates and are abusive towards meps from other countries when there is no call for it			0
i was outraged when i heard mr @entity0 talk of a ‘ fifth column ’ of immigrants in @entity31			2
i have worked hard all my life , and when my father came to this country he worked his socks off to provide for his family			0
it is an insult for him to talk in this way			0
i joined @entity2 because i wanted a referendum on the @entity32 and wanted better controls on immigration			2
but now i have no doubt that mr @entity13 will deliver on this , so , in my view , @entity2 has outlived its usefulness			0
mr @entity0 wants to use @entity2 as a means for getting power for himself , and that is not what the party was set up to achieve			1
he has created a popularist image for himself as the jolly chap at the bar with a pint in his hand , but the reality is different			0
he runs the party like a dictator , employs people who are totally inappropriate for party positions and gets rid of anybody who stands in his way			0
@entity2 is guided more by dogma than common sense			0
since i became an mep , i have been amazed that @entity2 often votes against @entity31 ’s national interest in the @entity249			0
for example , we were told to vote against @entity32 money for flood relief schemes in the @entity31 because the money had come from @entity61			0
i protested that this was ridiculous because much of the @entity32 money was @entity31 in the first place , but i was ignored			0
and @entity2 ’s reaction on finding out that i was going to join the @entity259 sums up what is wrong with them			1
they made a crude attempt to smear me with false allegations of irregularities in the recruitment of @entity268 members in @entity269			0
there is not a shred of truth in any of the claims but it has made me more convinced than ever that i made the right decision			0
there is no escaping one simple fact : when mr @entity13 said : ‘ if you go to bed with @entity0 on election night , you will wake with @entity281 the next day , ’ he was telling the truth .			1

@entity0 feels the heat after terrible day of headlines for his party
@entity288 said ' @entity2 is *pointless* ' before defecting to @entity259 party
he said @entity2 was ' pretty amateur ' and had a ' ridiculous ' lack of policies
@entity2 claims @entity9 was *suspended* over ' extremely serious ' allegations
party secretary @entity14 said @entity2 should represent ' bigots '
said the @entity16 as a ' waste of money ' and the ' @entity123 bunker of socialism '
