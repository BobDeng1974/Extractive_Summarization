by @entity0 voluntary policemen should be issued with @entity3 , a senior officer said last night			2
@entity4 , a leading special constable , said he and other volunteers face the same risks as ordinary officers and need the same protection			1
he said the 50,000 - volt weapons were a highly effective deterrent against dangerous criminals who do not distinguish between specials and regular officers			1
a @entity15 police officer brandishes a @entity3 : voluntary policemen should also be issued with @entity3 , a senior officer said last night , because they face the same dangers on the job as their full - time colleagues his comments came as the police watchdog said more officers than ever are armed with stun guns , which are being fired at record rates			1
the @entity26 warned the devices should not become the normal way of controlling violent suspects			0
mr @entity4 , an assistant chief officer for the @entity30 in @entity31 , said specials already carried a baton , handcuffs and incapacitant spray			1
but he said @entity3 can make a ‘ dramatic difference ’ and some specials are attached to teams where every other officer has one			1
‘ specials face the same risks as their regular colleagues day in , day out			1
they may not do it all the time but the public do not distinguish between us , ’ he added			0
‘ this is about equipping officers with the tools to do the job , as long as they are appropriately trained , appropriately selected and appropriately deployed			0
‘ it does n’t matter that you only work four hours a week when you are staring at a man with a knife			0
’ mr @entity4 , who has more than 20 years of experience , spoke out after @entity56 decided against allowing trained specials to have tasers			1
the force backed down from a proposed pilot scheme amid criticism from campaign groups and frontline police representatives			1
the move would have been a considerable further expansion of the weapon ’s use since it was introduced in @entity68 in 2003			0
at first only firearms officers were handed @entity3 but their availability has soared so that one in ten officers are trained to wield one			0
many forces have invested huge sums in the potentially deadly stun guns that are fired an average of five times a day across all forces			1
the number of confrontations involving @entity3 more than doubled between 2009 and 2011 , from 3,500 to 7,250			0
mr @entity4 's comments came as the police watchdog said more officers than ever are armed with stun guns tasers operate by firing two metal barbs into a person , delivering a jolt of electricity that immobilises them by overcoming their central nervous system			1
yesterday , the @entity26 said police must be able to justify the use of the weapons every time they are used			2
it called for clearer guidance on the use of @entity3 on those in custody and vulnerable people , including children and those with mental illness			0
officials again highlighted concerns about the use of the weapons in ‘ drive stun ’ mode , in which they cause excruciating pain through direct contact with the skin			2
they found several cases in which the use of a taser in this manner further inflamed a violent confrontation			0
the watchdog continues to investigate three high - profile deaths in which @entity3 may have played a part			2
these include that of @entity124 who suffered horrific injuries in a fireball after dousing himself in fuel in his @entity129 garden last year			0
@entity130 , of the @entity26 , said there were legitimate reasons for firing @entity3 in the most difficult and challenging situations			0
but she added that police forces must ensure they do not become a ‘ default choice ’ , particularly when methods as simple as talking to suspects could be equally effective .			2

the weapons are an effective deterrent , claims leading special constable
comments come as watchdog warns they are being fired at record rates
