what 's @entity2 ’s secret to keeping his fringe players happy ? despite the abundance of world - class talent at his disposal , @entity2 has resisted the temptation to fiddle with his starting line - up too much this season			1
this is obviously working , with just one defeat in all competitions since the start of the season			1
@entity2 has resisted the temptation to fiddle with his starting line - up too much this season but why is it that , unlike other clubs , you do n’t hear a peep out of those players who are not regularly in @entity20 ’s starting @entity21 ? @entity22 , a £ 16million signing from @entity24 who won @entity26 and finished runner - up in the @entity28 last season , has started three @entity31 games			1
goalkeeper @entity32 , one of the major figures in @entity20 ’s modern era , has made just one league start following @entity37 ’ arrival at the club			1
@entity22 ( right ) arrived at @entity20 for £ 16million in the summer but has started just three games @entity40 ( left ) has been a stalwart at @entity41 but has featured sparingly this season @entity40 , another multiple medal winner at @entity41 , is not playing and there are more high - profile stars who will be warming the bench this @entity46			1
yet , there have been virtually no declarations of frustration or unhappiness under @entity2 ( right ) , whose side travel to @entity52 tonight			1
@entity2 said : ‘ it ’s not difficult for me to leave players out			2
everybody has to be ready to sacrifice for the team , to give everything for the team , not to be selfish			2
‘ this is the way i want a team to be			2
@entity40 , for example , it was the first time he played against @entity64 and he was our best player			1
‘ how can he be our best player if he did n’t play in three months ? because he was working every day at the top level			1
goalkeeper @entity32 has made just one start for @entity2 's side this term @entity32 ( left ) has been second choice for the @entity71 since the arrival of @entity37 ‘ are the players sad , frustrated , not happy ? maybe , but professional			1
players need to be patient			2
i do n’t have a secret			2
‘ the reality is that , to be professional and work at a high level , you do n’t need to be happy			1
@entity81 has n’t played a second but if he has to play tomorrow he would be ready			2
’ the silence from his players is even more incredible given @entity2 does not offer those who have been left out any explanation why			2
‘ i just put the team up			0
do i explain it ? no , ’ said the @entity86			0
‘ it ’s my decision			0
players may not be happy or not agree with the decision , but they know my decision is not to favour somebody or to punish somebody			0
@entity52 manager @entity94 ( right ) thinks @entity20 have the squad depth to lscure four trophies this season ‘ it ’s what i think is best for the team at a certain moment			1
i do n’t give explanations to players unless they ask me for one			0
‘ if they ask me to explain , no problem			0
if they ask , i ’ll explain			0
i had one who asked , knocking on my door asking why someone else was playing instead of him			0
i said he was playing better , closed door , goodbye			0
’ @entity52 manager @entity94 , a @entity20 player in the @entity111 era , says his old club have the strength in depth to win an unprecedented quadruple of @entity31 , @entity28 , @entity116 and @entity117			1
‘ it would n’t surprise me , ’ he said			0
‘ it ’s a big ask — a lot of things have to go your way ( but ) they are strong enough			0
