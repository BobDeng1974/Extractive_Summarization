by @entity0 published : 04:53 est , 10 february 2013 updated : 14:09 est , 11 february 2013 getting an unexpected parking ticket can be very frustrating , and having your car towed away is even worse			1
but when @entity5 , from @entity6 , @entity7 , came back to find officials had painted a disabled bay around her legally parked car , she was understandably outraged			1
@entity12 footage shows she had parked her car in a bay outside her home on february 3 , but it was later towed away by municipal workers after the space was turned into a disabled spot in her absence			1
the angry motorist was adamant she had parked legally and managed to obtain @entity12 footage which proved her right from a security company located opposite the car parking space			1
she took to @entity40 on february 5 to vent her anger and posted the clip , which has since been shared more than 21,000 on the social networking site alone			2
she said it was a ' big surprise ' to find her car gone and when she saw a disabled bay had been painted there she said : ' i could not believe my eyes			1
' needless to say , the disabled parking was not there when i looked ( it was a blue and white ) and i refused to believe it			1
i called my friend who was with me when parking the vehicle , trying to make sure that i was n't crazy or getting senile , and confirmed we had parked blue and white			2
officials managed to paint a disabled bay around @entity59 's car while it was still parked in the space a tow truck arrives to remove @entity59 's car , which is now parked illegally after a disabled bay was painted around it the car is removed from the space and @entity59 was ordered to pay fines totalling 1350 @entity34 ( £ 223 ) ' i discovered that there are security cameras in the building			1
a security company was very nice and agreed to show me the footage			2
' she invited people to watch the video on her @entity40 profile and said : ' just to see and believe			0
while vehicles are parked blue and white , two municipal employees come and mark around the disabled parking ! ' ' simply			2
within five minutes they made me break the law			0
it 's just bullying and contempt never seen before in the @entity6 municipality			0
she added : ' but how could you do such a thing without contacting me ? it has a licence plate on the car and you can call , contact the owner and ask to move the vehicle			0
' ms @entity5 described feeling ' upset ' when she contacted authorities and officials doubted her			0
' he said i was lying , that he did not believe me , ' she said			0
ms @entity5 says she plans to sue the city , which has already apologised for the incident			0
' i will launch proceedings on the injustice and anguish , but above all for your transgressions			0

@entity59 was ordered to pay £ 223 despite parking legally
she obtained @entity12 footage which showed the bay was painted afterwards
