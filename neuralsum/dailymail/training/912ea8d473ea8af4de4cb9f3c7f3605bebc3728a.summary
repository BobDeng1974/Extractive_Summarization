a @entity1 teen has been granted a new chance to argue there was insufficient evidence to convict him of killing his father 's pregnant fiancee when the boy was 11 years old			1
the state @entity10 on monday sent the matter back to @entity13 juvenile court to hold a hearing about the evidence used to convict @entity16 of the february 2009 shotgun killing of 26 - year - old @entity18 and her unborn son at their home near @entity22			1
one of @entity16 's attorneys , @entity24 , said his lawyers will file a motion seeking a new trial , arguing that his prior adjudication of delinquency in juvenile court went against the weight of the evidence			2
another chance : now 17 , @entity16 ( right and left ) was 11 when he was arrested for the shooting murder of his father 's fiancee and her unborn baby killed : @entity16 was found guilty of shooting with a shotgun 26 - year - old @entity18 ( center ) in 2009 she called the high court decision gratifying but noted @entity16 , now 17 , remains incarcerated			1
she said he has always maintained his innocence			0
' it is a concern that we 're going to be remanded and have to start this process all over again , ' @entity24 said			0
' @entity46 is of an essence when you are a child and sitting in a facility			0
' messages seeking comment from the attorney general 's office , which is prosecuting the case , were not immediately returned			0
in the four - justice majority opinion , justice @entity54 described some of the evidentiary issues , including whether there was enough evidence to tie @entity16 to the murder weapon , the possible role of a black truck @entity16 said he saw by their garage before leaving for school and @entity16 's healthy relationship with @entity67			1
cold blooded ? @entity16 ( here with his father ) has maintained his innocence from the beginning			0
prosecutors maintain he used his own youth model shotgun to murder @entity67 in february 2009 before he went to school with her 7 - year - old daughter weak case ? @entity16 was arrested less than one day after @entity67 's death			1
however , evidence against him is largely circumstantial up the judicial ladder : @entity16 's conviction was overturned in @entity82 , which led to this week 's @entity10 ruling @entity16 's father , @entity84 said , testified that his son and fiancee were ' just as normal as it was between her and her own daughters			1
' @entity67 's ex-boyfriend , @entity84 wrote , denied making threatening phone calls to @entity67 and said he was not upset by a blood test that showed he was not the father of one of @entity67 's children			2
the county judge , @entity84 said , excluded the ex-boyfriend in part because his hands lacked gunshot residue , he claimed he did not know where @entity67 lived and because only children 's footprints were seen in the snow between the house and the school bus stop			2
@entity108 , which reviewed the case last year , said the conviction was ' plainly contrary to the evidence			0
' @entity16 is under court supervision until he turns 21 ; his status is reviewed twice a year			0
@entity16 's father , @entity84 said , testified that his son and fiancee were ' just as normal as it was between her and her own daughters			2

@entity16 of @entity22 , @entity1 ***--*** now 17 - years - old ***--*** was granted on monday a chance to argue he was *unfairly* convicted in 2009
@entity16 was convicted of shooting dead with a shotgun 26 - year - old @entity67 and his unborn half *brother*
@entity16 's case conviction was overturned in @entity82 and that decision was appealed ***--*** the @entity10 ruled on it this week
@entity16 nonetheless remains incarcerated
