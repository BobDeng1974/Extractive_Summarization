more terrorists could be kicked out of the country if it was not for the @entity4 , @entity0 suggested this morning			1
the prime minister said the government needed to ' restore ' @entity8 's ability to deport extremists , but said it was crucial to overhaul the @entity11 to do this			1
@entity13 has blocked any move to curtail the power of the @entity17 court			2
mr @entity0 also revealed he was a ' @entity18 ' , attacked mr @entity13 's claim it was unpatriotic to be eurosceptic and suggested @entity22 's support would collapse by the time of the next election			1
the @entity34 spent 10 years in @entity8 avoiding being kicked out mr @entity0 's remarks came after he was criticised for relying on the @entity30 to convict hate preacher @entity26 of 11 terror offences			1
the hook - handed @entity34 clreic spent 10 years in @entity8 attacking the @entity38 - before finally being deported to @entity30 in 2012			0
the @entity39 said ' justice has been done ' but insisted @entity8 should not ' talk ourselves down ' over the failure to convict him in the @entity8			0
but he admitted there were too many legal hurdles in the way of kicking out terrorrists - and suggested he was being blocked in his bid to cut these back by @entity13			2
hardline justice secretary @entity49 has vowed to curtail the @entity11			2
he wants the final decision to rest with the @entity8 @entity51 in @entity52 and not in the @entity53 in @entity17 he said : ' we need to look at the avenues of appeal that there are and make sure that those are gone through more quickly – and we have made changes there			0
' obviously we also need to look , as i ’ve said many times , at the @entity11 and the position we have got to get into where if someone threatens our country we should be able to deport them if they have no right to be here and that is absolutely essential , that we restore that			2
' we ’ve taken some big steps , but i plan to take more steps if i ’m elected as a @entity76 prime minister after the next election			1
' in a wide - ranging interview on @entity79 this morning , ahead of thursday 's @entity81 elections , the prime minister also claimed he was a ' thatcherite ' and predicted that @entity22 supporters would flock back to him in time for the general election			1
the @entity76 leader said he was as committed to people buying their own home as @entity87			0
asked if he was a thatcherite in this regard , mr @entity0 said : ' absolutely			2
i think it was n’t just @entity87			0
since the @entity91 , conservative leaders have always believed in a property - owning democracy ' @entity0 said the desire to buy your own property was ' natural ' and he wanted to help more people get their first home the @entity39 claimed @entity98 had tried to extinguish mrs @entity87 's right to buy - and he wanted to get it going again			1
he said : ' i think the introduction of the @entity102 to buy and those discounts @entity87 introduced were incredibly important in our country and i ’ve tried to relight the @entity102 to buy fire , as it were			0
' i want to see more people buy and own their homes			0
it is a very natural instinct			0
i think all of us – i can remember the moment i walked through the door of the first flat that i bought and the pride that you feel and you sense that it ’s your own and you can develop and improve it			0
' it ’s a deep , natural human instinct and i fully support it			0
' he claimed that he was putting ' rocket boosters ' under mrs @entity87 's ' @entity122 ' your council house scheme			1
the @entity39 added : ' now , it ’s been very challenging in recent years because we had the appalling boom and bust and crash and the banks have been taking time to recover so it ’s been difficult for people to get the loans they need , but all of this , like the rest of the economy , is mending and people are now able to get those loans			0
' mr @entity0 also appeared to accept that @entity22 would siphon off @entity76 supporters in this week 's election			1
but he insisted they would come back into the @entity76 fold in time for the general election - because they would realise that only he could give them an in - out referendum on @entity81			1
he said : ' in many ways of course the referendum pledge will have its greatest relevance at the time of the next election when people will be choosing : " do you want to have the @entity76 , @entity0 , continue in office with a long - term economic plan that ’s turning the country around and an in / out referendum ? " ' do you want those things or do you want @entity98 that will tax , spend and borrow ? ' or do you want to vote for another party that could risk not having a long - term economic plan and the referendum ? ' @entity163 is expected to win this week 's @entity81 elections - but the prime minister this morning claimed many @entity22 supporters would vote for the @entity167 in the next general election because of his promise to hold an in - out referendum in 2017 mr @entity0 also hit back at @entity13 ’s claims that euroscepticism was ' unpatriotic '			1
' you can be deeply patriotic and love your country and believe that its place belongs inside the @entity176 or you can be deeply patriotic , love your country and believe it belongs outside the @entity176 , ' mr @entity0 said			2
he added : ' your patriotism is not defined by your position on this question ; your patriotism is defined by your love of your country , its institutions , its history , what it can do in the world			0
