and you thought romance was dead ? then think again because everybody is in love with this kid @entity4			1
it was the game of his life , like watching someone win the goal of the season , player of the year and world player of the year award all on the same night			0
it will have to end with an @entity15 call up			2
here at @entity16 , when @entity18 ’s team put away their great @entity20 rivals @entity19 5 - 3 , @entity4 was magnificent			1
at the final whistle this remarkable young man milked the moment , taking his time to leave his field of dreams and lapping up the applause from @entity38 supporters			1
he was entitled to do so			0
@entity4 owns the place now , the main man in this team as they continue their charge up the table			1
they have to fancy themselves for fourth			0
in a performance that most analysts would agree was borderline ‘ complete ’ , @entity4 made mugs of two of the best defenders in @entity53 football			2
he embarrassed @entity54 to such an extent that the @entity19 defender booted @entity4 in the back in frustration when things were going against them			1
for good measure , @entity54 then kicked his calf			0
@entity54 kicks @entity4 in the back as the game was slipping out of @entity19 's reach ‘ i did n’t see it , but he did complain afterwards that his back is a little bit sore , ’ revealed @entity18			1
what a silly boy , losing his rag with @entity4 because this young @entity38 striker had turned him this way and that for 90 , frankly , mesmerising minutes			1
@entity71 , perhaps the finest @entity53 central defender of his generation , was way off the pace here			0
@entity4 murdered the pair of them			2
‘ it shows how good we are , scoring five goals against one of the best defences in the world and it is all coming together , ’ claimed @entity4			1
‘ we are delighted , we want to keep this run going			0
i am enjoying it , especially as we get so much stick from the @entity19 supporters			2
’ this time we only ever heard from @entity38 , chirping up when @entity4 scored a magnificent equaliser from the edge of the area			1
what an iconic figure he has become , a talisman in this @entity38 team as they try to make a move on the top four			2
they are on their way there			0
@entity4 is sent tumbling by @entity54 to earn @entity38 a penalty in first - half stoppage time he scores goals in every competition : @entity101 , @entity102 and @entity103			1
on monday , he ca n’t wait to get his teeth stuck into @entity105			0
@entity4 has scored 17 times now and he will be under consideration for a place in the @entity15 squad when @entity109 finally returns from an extra long @entity111 holiday			1
wherever he is in the world @entity15 ’s head coach will have heard about this because this remarkable young man is one of the most talked about footballers in the @entity103 at this moment			2
‘ we need to be careful with him , but we can not hide him away , ’ admitted @entity18 after his first ever victory against a team put out by @entity120			0
@entity29 ( right ) celebrates with @entity4 after scoring @entity38 's fifth goal ‘ the national team is not my decision , but we try to improve him every day and if the @entity15 coach believes in him and wants to give him the opportunity it is good			1
‘ @entity4 is still young , but in the last few months he has had the chance to play more and show his qualities			2
we are happy with that			0
’ in the final moments , when @entity4 was motioning with his arms to tell his team - mates to calm down and see this extraordinary game out , it was like watching a future @entity38 captain			1
he is having that effect around the place , galvanising the @entity38 supporters as they start to make an impression in the higher reaches of the table			0
credit to them because even when they went a goal down at @entity16 , they stayed with their team			0
what a difference that made			0
@entity4 and team - mate @entity154 celebrate at the final whistle as @entity38 moved up to fifth they believed in them , waiting patiently for @entity4 to take this game by the scruff of the neck			1
the kid is n't afraid of anyone			0
@entity38 fans show so much passion for him here , belting out his name at the top of their voices after his second beat @entity168 in the 52nd minute			2
on monday , in an @entity171 third round tie with @entity105 , the love affair continues .			0

@entity38 beat @entity19 5 - 3 at @entity16 on @entity23
@entity38 striker @entity4 was man of the match after scoring twice
@entity4 is hotly *tipped* to be in @entity109 's next @entity15 squad
