by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor deputy prime minister @entity2 accused @entity3 of wanting the recovery to not recover the @entity5 has been ' praying ' the economic recovery does not recover so it can continue to attack the government , @entity2 claimed tonight			1
the deputy prime minister accused @entity8 and @entity9 of wanting the recession to continue so voters would fee poorer at the time of the general election			1
but mr @entity2 insisted @entity3 was to blame for the economic ' mess ' left by the last government , and wages were now rising			1
mr @entity8 will use a speech tomorrow to warn @entity18 faces another five years of squeezed incomes			1
he claims the middle classes are missing out on the benefits of a return to growth , with wage rises outstripped by soaring prices			1
mr @entity8 has rejected calls from within his own party for a more upbeat message to voters , instead claiming ‘ millions of families are caught in the crosshairs of a cost of living crisis ’			1
but mr @entity2 hit back at the @entity3 leader , insisting the opposition had been ' wrong ' on all the big economic judgements and had helped to bring ' the country to its knees '			2
speaking at @entity38 , a business forum reception in @entity40 tonight , mr @entity2 said : ' the @entity3 leadership has spent the last four years praying that the recovery would not materialise			2
' for a long time they insisted that the @entity45 ’s action to tackle the deficit would choke off growth			0
wrong : the deficit has been eliminated by a third and growth is back			0
' then they claimed unemployment would rise by a million			0
wrong : unemployment is coming down and we are seeing record numbers of people in work			0
' now , having decisively lost these arguments , @entity8 and @entity9 have settled on a different refrain : blaming the @entity45 for a crisis in the cost of living			1
' @entity62 deputy pm @entity2 @entity3 has seen its poll lead wither as the economic recovery has built momentum			1
some surveys have put the party just one point ahead of the @entity69 , with more people trusting @entity71 and @entity72 to run the economy			0
after predicting that austerity would lead another 1million out of work , @entity3 has been stung by figures showing there are 1.2million more people in jobs than when the coalition was formed			2
more recently mr @entity8 has accused the government of overseeing a cost of living crisis , with people in work seeing small pay rises dwarfed by increases in food , energy and household bills			1
however a new study today claimed middle class families weathered the recession by shopping in cheaper supermarkets , using grandparents for free childcare and taking on extra jobs			1
labour leader @entity8 claimed middle class families were not enjoying the benefits of a return to growth mr @entity2 admitted it is ' certainly true ' that many households have been under considerable pressure , with some families struggling to make ends meet			1
but he added : ' we must n't forget what got us here in the first place			0
in 2008 we experienced a crisis in our banks which brought the country to its knees and which damaged our economy in ways which were deep and profound			0
' @entity3 were the authors of that crisis and yet they now seek to deny any responsibility for it			1
they still do not understand that healthy household budgets flow directly from a healthy economy - you can not divorce the two			0
' when @entity3 were in government they made each family £ 3,000 worse off by overseeing a recession that wiped £ 112bn from our economy			1
' he said the coalition was taking action to help create greater confidence , more jobs and further growth and helping families by easing childcare costs , freezing fuel duty and keeping council tax bills down			0
official figures show the economy grew by 0.7 per cent in the last three months of 2013 , the fourth quarter of growth in a row middle class families weathered the recession by shopping in cheaper supermarkets , using grandparents for free childcare and taking on extra jobs , a report published today reveals			1
households in the social group became ‘ very good ’ at adapting their spending and employment in order to ride out the crisis , says research by a think - tank			2
some even managed to move into a higher income bracket despite the economic downturn , the @entity157 said			0
more women went out to work as families sought to make ends meet , with the proportion of double - income households rising from 35 per cent to 49 per cent			2
an analysis of household income also found that the middle classes became bargain seekers , switching stores and hunting out cheaper deals to avoid the 25 per cent increase in food prices			1
and there was also a dramatic rise in the number of people using the generosity of grandparents and other relatives to help with childcare to cut the cost of a childminder or nursery			0
middle earners are now using 20 per cent more ‘ free ’ care for the under - twos than they were in 2007 , says the report			1
around one in five families deemed middle income in 2008 – with a net income of between £ 26,100 and £ 41,200 – fell down the income scale as a result of the financial crisis			1
but two - fifths stayed where they were , and the remaining two - fifths have since climbed into the higher brackets			0
millions of people will be better off by not paying tax on the first £ 10,500 they earn , mr @entity2 added			0
he went on : ' @entity8 is clutching at straws and now he ’s down to his last one			2
' instead of making specious claims , the @entity5 should take responsibility for the past : apologising to the @entity18 people for presiding over the biggest economic crisis in living memory and pursuing a credible economic strategy to prove that they have learnt from their mistakes			1
' experts expect wage increases to overtake inflation in the next few months , but mr @entity8 has made clear he will not abandon the line of attack			2
he will use a speech tomorrow to set out what is being bill as ‘ the next big economic reform of @entity3 ’s plan to tackle the cost of living crisis ’			1
tomorrow mr @entity8 is expected to signal action to tackle low pay , increase house building and encourage firms to hire more workers			2
he will also back a plan for @entity18 ’s great cities and towns to become ‘ engines of growth ’			0
ahead of the speech mr @entity8 warned that the return to economic growth does not mean the financial pain is over			2
figures from the @entity238 predict that real earnings will increase at only half the level of gdp growth in 2015 and will continue to lag behind at least until 2018 - breaking the pattern of decades before the 1990s which saw middle - class living standards improving in line with the economy as a whole			2
in an article for @entity250 , the @entity3 leader wrote : ‘ millions of families are caught in the crosshairs of a cost - of - living crisis : a few people at the top scoop more and more of the rewards ; markets such as energy have become uncompetitive , allowing huge prices to be imposed on consumers ; and many of the new jobs being created require fewer skills , pay lower wages and offer less security			1
‘ this government can not deal with these problems because lying beneath its claims of being converted to full employment is an economic ideology built on low pay , low skills , low prospects and low productivity			0
‘ we can and must do better than this			0
@entity3 knows that if @entity18 stays in this race to the bottom , the cost - of - living crisis will continue - unaddressed and unsolved - for the five years of the next @entity280 too			1
‘ wages for most people will continue to lag far behind the wealth being created and middle - income families will still be locked out of the benefits of growth			2
’ but @entity287 chairman @entity287 said mr @entity8 was talking about a problem ‘ created by the @entity3 government ’			1
he said : ‘ @entity3 's @entity290 made people who work hard poorer , and their unbalanced economy saw just one job created in the @entity294 and @entity295 for every 10 created in the @entity296			0
‘ our long - term economic plan to secure a better for the whole of @entity18 is about creating jobs in every part of our country - meaning more people having the security of a regular pay packet			0
that 's the only way to raise living standards for everyone			0
‘ but @entity8 has no plan			0
all he offers is short - term quick fixes , and more spending , more borrowing and more taxes			0
that 's exactly what got us into a mess in the first place , and hardworking people will pay the price with a less secure future			0
