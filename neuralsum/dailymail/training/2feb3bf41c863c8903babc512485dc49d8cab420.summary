by @entity0 safety levels at three @entity3 airports run by military air traffic controllers has come under fire after a former @entity7 chief pilot called on the government to investigate why their safety records were poorer than those of civilian counterparts			1
@entity13 , who was @entity7 ' chief pilot from 2002 - 08 , has called for a three person independent inquiry to examine why @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20 airports are at higher risk of experiencing mid-air collisions , the @entity3 reports			1
the three airports , while not unsafe , have a higher number of ' loss of separation ' incidents , which means passenger planes pass too close to each other , according to an @entity31 report			0
the report , released in october last year , found that military controllers were involved in 36 percent of loss of separation occurrences between 2008 - 12 , even though they were responsible for controlling only 25 percent of aircraft movements			0
' most of these loss of separation occurrences were contributed to by air traffic controller actions , ' the @entity31 report found			2
' this may be a result of the nature of aircraft operations and airspace constraints at some military airports , leading to reduced use and effectiveness of strategic separation defences , thereby placing more responsibility for separating aircraft directly onto the controllers			0
' @entity64 is one of three run by military air traffic controllers because they are adjacent to military bases @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20 airports are all next to military bases , which means military air traffic controllers are responsible for controlling civil air traffic too			1
' i find it difficult to believe that a @entity31 report that highlights safety issues has received scant attention - makes you wonder why they bother doing a report if there 's no obvious desire to address the real problems raised , ' mr @entity37 said			2
he has also called on the government to subject @entity3 's military air traffic controllers to the same safety auditing the @entity86 conducts on its civilian counterparts			1
the three airports , while not unsafe , have a higher number of ' loss of separation ' incidents , which means passenger planes pass too close to each other			0

@entity13 has called for an inquiry to investigate why safety records of military air traffic controllers is poorer than civilian counterparts
@entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20 airports are at a higher risk of mid-air collisions , according to safety *bureau* figures
mr @entity37 , who was @entity7 ' chief pilot from 2002 - 08 , says there should be no difference between safety levels
