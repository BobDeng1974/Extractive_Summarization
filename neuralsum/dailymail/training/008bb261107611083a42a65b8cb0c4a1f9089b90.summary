by @entity0 published : 10:47 est , 8 august 2012 updated : 12:37 est , 8 august 2012 we may be harvesting a formidable crop of @entity4 medals - but when it comes to celebrating , man mountain @entity5 can teach us a thing or two about style			1
unlike many of our athletes , the 6ft 7in discus champion did n't bother shedding a tear when he took gold with a mammoth throw			1
instead , he tore his shirt off @entity18 style , flexed his muscles with a mighty roar and grabbed a @entity22 flag from the @entity23			2
then he tried his luck at another gold medal , this time in the women 's hurdles			0
next , he raced towards the @entity4 cauldron , reached in , and attempted unsuccessfully to liberate one of the flaming prongs			2
finished now @entity54 ? er , not quite			0
after leaving the stadium he headed out with friends and team - mates for a night to remember			0
his extraordinary celebration continued aboard a @entity22 cruise liner docked in @entity61 to accommodate the @entity22 team , embraced an alcohol - fuelled night on the tiles - and ended with him falling asleep on a train , being robbed , and barred entry to the @entity4 village yesterday after losing his accreditation			1
ripping it up : @entity5 has apparently made it a victory tradition to tear up his shirt after each discus win beat that for @entity4 gold ! the first fans and friends knew of his troubles came when he tweeted in ( almost ) @entity79 : ' puuh i just got robbed while i did some work to please athletic fans ! i lost all my accredition [ sic ] for @entity84 ! - no entrance			1
' shortly after dawn he managed to get a message to @entity22 team manager @entity89 but had to wait until 8am before arrangements were made to get him in			2
first reports said he went to bed ' dead tired ' - and without realising he was no longer in possession of his kit and equipment			0
do n't stop me now : @entity5 , 27 , showed impressive hurdling ability despite weighing in at 20 - stone jumping for joy : after ripping his shirt off , @entity5 continued his victory lap by vaulting the hurdles which had been placed for the women 's 100m final lap of honour : the big @entity22 vaulted all the 100m hurdles , to huge applause from the @entity23 crowd no stopping me : @entity5 went on from his impromptu hurdles vault to a drinking session on a @entity22 cruise liner , before falling asleep on a train and having his bag stolen after waking up without his bag following his celebratory exploits , @entity5 took to @entity117 to reveal the predicament he found himself in back home in the @entity120 , however , he was hailed as a hero			1
in his native @entity123 , officials were preparing a homecoming victory parade and were singing his praises			0
@entity127 @entity126 mayor @entity126 described his victory as ' phenomenal '			0
he added : ' he is , and remains , a symbol of @entity123 sport			0
' meanwhile the athlete 's stadium antics took off on @entity133 ( and possibly on @entity134 somewhere along the @entity135 )			0
@entity5 , unbeaten in a straight run of 29 competitions , is known as @entity142 by fans , a reference to the circle from which the discus is thrown			1
@entity5 's throw of 68.27m - the width of a football pitch - saw him crowned @entity4 champion for the first time his winning mark for the 2012 games was a formidable 68.27 metres , the width of an @entity4 football pitch			1
the big @entity22 is unlikely to face any disciplinary measures for his exuberance , although officials did inspect the @entity4 cauldron afterwards for possible damage			1
he was even allowed a lie - in yesterday			0
@entity22 medal winners are normally expected to be on public parade at 9.00am on the morning following their victory but @entity5 was allowed to sleep in and attend the afternoon one instead			1
video : i will retire from a hurdling career			0
@entity5 jovial after his rambunctious celebrations			2

@entity22 discus star @entity5 goes on joyful hurdling lap after win
he claimed discus gold with throw of 68.27m
@entity5 then tried to take one of the @entity4 flames before going on drinking session on @entity22 cruise liner
after alcohol - fuelled session he fell asleep on a train and had his @entity84 accreditation stolen
