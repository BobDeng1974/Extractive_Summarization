by @entity0 published : 05:07 est , 9 april 2013 updated : 05:35 est , 9 april 2013 a car thief let his glow - in - the - dark disguise slip - by posing in it on @entity4			2
@entity5 , 25 , was known as the ' green skull man ' after he sported a luminous @entity8 mask to terrify his victims			1
but when police found the mask dumped at the roadside following a knifepoint raid , they carried out dna tests and trawled the social networking site for @entity5 's profile			1
@entity5 was caught when officers found a picture he had posted on @entity4 wearing his glow - in - the - dark disguise officers eventually found a picture of him posing on his profile page wearing the same mask and flicking v signs at the camera			1
today @entity27 released the photo of @entity5 as he began a five year jail term			2
one officer said : ' the dna evidence was clear cut but this man will feel a prize chump for posting a picture of himself posing with his own disguise for all the world to see			0
' it 's an extremely distinctive mask and you would have thought he would be keen to keep it to himself - not splash it over the internet			2
it just goes to show the idiotic lengths some criminal will go to to brag about their crimes			0
' the raid occurred on january 7 at 8pm when a 51 - year old woman was returning to her £ 20,000 @entity51 after a shopping trip at @entity53 's in @entity54 , @entity55			2
@entity57 @entity56 heard that @entity5 put on his mask and high visibility jacket then ambushed the woman as she put her shopping in her car			1
he threatened her with a kitchen knife before demanding her keys but ran off when he could n't start the car			1
he ditched the jacket and mask but was linked to the crime when his dna was found in saliva inside the mask			1
it emerged he had targeted a couple on @entity73 , who had parked their @entity75 outside a @entity77 store in @entity57			0
@entity5 , who has 32 convictions for 70 offences , was jailed for five years at @entity80 the driver was inside the shop when @entity5 leapt into the vehicle and threatened the driver 's wife , who was sat in the passenger seat , with a knife			1
she fled and ran to her husband virtually ' unable to breathe ' while @entity5 sped off in their car			2
the vehicle was found in @entity54 later with false registration plates			0
@entity5 , who has 32 convictions for 70 offences , had only been out of jail for a few months when he was arrested			1
in april 2012 he was jailed for 16 months after he knocked down and injured a firefighter while stealing a @entity95 from outside @entity96			0
@entity5 , of no fixed address , pleaded guilty to attempted robbery and possession of an offensive weapon and was also ordered to pay £ 120 in compensation			1
in mitigation he claimed his latest crimes were ' a cry for attention ' by the way he has been dealt with by the authorities in the past			0
but passing sentence the judge mr recorder @entity111 - @entity110 said : ' these were serious offences with pre-planning , disguises used , they were at night and ladies were the victims in each case			0
' det sgt @entity119 , of @entity27 , said : ' this was a terrifying ordeal for the victim who was left shaken and frightened by what happened			0
' we treat any attack of this nature extremely seriously and will always carry out full and thorough investigations to identify those involved and bring them to justice			0
' this should send a clear message to criminals who think they can get away with committing crimes such as this , that they will be caught and will go to prison			0
