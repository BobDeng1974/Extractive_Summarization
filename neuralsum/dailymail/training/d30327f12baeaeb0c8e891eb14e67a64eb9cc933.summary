by @entity0 and @entity1 it seemed the perfect addition to their £ 1million home			1
@entity6 and @entity7 were delighted with their new patio , laid in slabs of finest @entity12 sandstone at the front of their property – named @entity16 , @entity17 for @entity18			0
but other residents of the affluent commuter belt @entity20 were dismayed to find the couple had dug up and paved over a third of the road outside			1
retreat : a builder begins to take down the gateposts before the offending patio is ripped up it meant cars had limited space to move at the end of the 100ft road , forcing drivers to perform multi-point turns to manoeuvre their way out of the leafy close			1
now , after a bitter legal dispute , a high court judge has ordered mr and mrs @entity7 to rip up the stonework as well as the fencing and gateposts they had cemented at its edge			0
they had effectively sealed off the area for their exclusive use , the court heard , taking over what had previously been a turning point for neighbours ’ vehicles			0
legal costs of fighting the case have left the @entity55 £ 200,000 worse off			1
but yesterday after a year of disruption and inconvenience , neighbours won their court battle to reclaim the land along the private road in @entity61 , @entity62			1
the town is one of @entity65 ’s most exclusive – familiar to millions as the backdrop to film and tv locations , including one used for @entity68			0
judges at the @entity70 ruled the @entity55 must dig up their patio , remove the gateposts and fencing , and reinstate the road surface			1
@entity75 , deputy judge of the @entity76 , said the ‘ giant ’ patio was a ‘ substantial interference ’ with other residents ’ rights of way – and the @entity55 had failed to show consideration for them			0
instead , she said , @entity39 and mrs @entity7 presented their neighbours with what they wanted to do – and then went ahead with it in spite of objections			0
the judge did not accept the couple ’s argument that they wanted the gates for security and said she believed they simply wanted to create ‘ a large enclosed area that they can only use for themselves ’			1
the court was told in a hearing last month that the @entity101 , who run a company that makes bespoke metal gates , wanted to turn the @entity20 into a gated close			0
the two other couples living on the road – @entity108 and @entity107 and @entity109 and @entity110 – objected			1
instead , @entity39 and mrs @entity7 then proposed putting a gate ‘ halfway down ’ the close that would give access to all their homes			0
a year later the @entity117 ’ solicitors wrote to the neighbouring couples to tell them building work was starting and they were advised they must keep the road clear ‘ at all times ’			1
before they could fully discuss the matter , gateposts were added and the fencing went up			0
battleground : the disputed private cul - de - sac in @entity61 , @entity62 , where the drama unfolded the judge observed that parking in the @entity20 had been ‘ a real challenge ’ since september 2012			2
she dismissed the @entity131 ’ counter-claim for a declaration that the neighbours were not entitled to access and that the gate would not interfere with their rights of way			0
last night friends of mrs @entity7 , 62 , said she and her 65 - year - old husband were ‘ heartbroken and devastated ’ over the ruling			2
the @entity55 bought the disputed land when they purchased @entity143 seven years ago , and they had always used it as a driveway			2
they argued the previous owner used to keep six cars and a boat on it and that their neighbours did not use the land			2
but neighbours claimed prescriptive rights over the land after saying they had exercised a right of way on it for 20 years , the period required under the @entity158			2
it is understood the @entity131 maintain they own the land , which is part of a private road , and therefore did not require planning permission for the patio .			1

wealthy couple fenced off , dug up and paved over road outside their home
@entity171 objected to the land grab , saying it *blocked* their right of way
@entity70 backs challenge and orders *homeowners* to *dismantle* the drive
the couple are ' heartbroken ' after spending £ 200,000 on @entity70 clash
