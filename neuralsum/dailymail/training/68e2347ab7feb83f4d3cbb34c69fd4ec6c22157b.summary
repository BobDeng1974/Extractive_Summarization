prince @entity0 regularly visits @entity1 and owns two houses out there a @entity5 double - decker bus , covered in images from the @entity7 , has drawn up outside the @entity5 ambassador 's residence in @entity10			1
the top floor has been converted into a classroom , its seats occupied by @entity1 schoolchildren			1
a familiar head appears up the stairs			2
' what have i missed ? ' asks prince @entity0			1
' bears ! wolves ! red squirrels ! ' the children shout			2
the @entity0 is here to support the @entity23 , which has turned the bus into a mobile classroom as part of its campaign to save the forests and wildlife of @entity1			1
it 's a subject close to @entity0 's heart			1
he first came here in 1998 on an official visit - the only time he 's visited on business			1
he fell so much under the spell of the place that he bought a house in one of the wooden villages , then acquired another property which he 's turned into a comfortable lodge			1
he makes a private visit for a few days every year if he can , preferably in may when the wild flowers are out , and both houses can be rented when @entity0 is n't there			1
the meadows of @entity1 are spectacular with a huge variety of species - as many as six times more to the square metre than can be found in @entity5 - as they 've never been sprayed with pesticides or herbicides			1
the air is fragrant with the scent of herbs such as wild thyme			2
' stop ! ' cried the prince when he spotted a creamy - coloured flower while walking with friends recently			1
' here 's the bastard toadflax			2
i 've wanted to see the bastard toadflax for ages			2
' he 's been so inspired he 's now planted a @entity66 at @entity67 , his @entity68 home , using a wild flower seed mix mostly gathered from the hay meadows at one of his properties			2
@entity0 first visited the country in 1998 on an official visit - the only time he 's visited on business			1
he is seen here with the then @entity1 president , @entity78 you do n't have to be in @entity80 for long to realise why the @entity0 is enraptured by it			1
the country looks as @entity83 might have done around the year 1800			2
horses are a common sight on the roads pulling trailers and in the fields yoked to ploughs			2
very little money circulates , but almost everything needed to support life can be found growing , or is made , in the villages			2
everybody is making jams , syrups and cordials out of every conceivable berry , fruit and nut			2
' it 's the last corner of @entity104 where you see true sustainability and complete resilience			2
there 's so much we can learn from it before it 's too late			2
' grapes , sweet from the summer sun , cluster from the vines that twine about the eaves of the farmhouses			2
geese waddle out of the farmyards			2
fruit swells in the orchards			2
sheep are often guarded by gipsy shepherds , accompanied by ferocious dogs capable of repelling wolves			2
it 's a land overflowing with good things , where weaving and embroidery are still practised			2
you 'll be hard pushed to find a mega supermarket			0
this is the world as prince @entity0 may very well feel @entity133 intended it to be			1
as he puts it , ' it 's the timelessness which is so important			0
' the landscape is ' almost out of some of these stories you used to read as a child			0
people are yearning for that sense of identity and belonging and meaning			0
' in @entity80 the @entity0 usually begins by visiting some of the environmental and rural development causes that he supports			1
he 'll then spend a day or two relaxing in the quiet and beauty of the countryside			0
but that does n't mean putting his feet up			0
walking is key for him - but the walks are accompanied by a bevy of botanists who can help inform and develop his ideas			0
in this hospitable country , villagers do what they can to make the @entity0 welcome			1
on his last visit a surprise was achieved by smuggling 120 children in traditional dress through the back door of a barn while the @entity0 was sipping an aperitif on the other side			1
a field of wildflowers belonging to @entity0 , in @entity169 , near @entity170 , @entity171 , @entity80 when the barn doors were thrown open , the @entity0 was regaled with a concert			1
so far , the @entity174 has n't been tempted to @entity80 , but it has found favour with the @entity0 's sons			1
in 2012 , prince @entity177 stayed with count @entity178 , who manages prince @entity0 's houses , having reportedly flown out on budget airline @entity180			1
it can cost as little as £ 40 to get to @entity1 from @entity182			1
the @entity66 landscape looks something like @entity185 , with more woods and no hedges			0
centuries - old trees stand in the meadows , giving shade to cattle in the fierce summer heats			0
the beechwoods are reminiscent of @entity194 ; only with hardly anybody about and no sign of human habitation for miles			0
there are more brown bears in @entity1 's forests than anywhere else in @entity104			1
they 're shy animals - even more elusive , for @entity0 , than the bastard toadflax , since he has n't actually seen one , even though they have been known to play on the hillside behind his lodge at @entity169			1
there are more brown bears in @entity1 's forests than anywhere else in @entity104 the forests are also home to wolves and lynx			1
scientists believe these large carnivores are essential to the forest ecosystem			0
if left unchecked , deer would eat every young shoot as it appeared above ground			0
wolves and lynx control their numbers , making it possible for the forest to regenerate			0
at a time when @entity5 is letting in large numbers of migrant workers from @entity1 , prince @entity0 is leading a small counter-migration : of well - heeled @entity230 @entity104 who delight in species - rich meadows and rickety farmhouses ( which , incidentally , can still be bought for a song )			1
' it 's the last corner of @entity104 where you see true sustainability and complete resilience , ' says the @entity0			1
' there 's so much we can learn from it before it 's too late			0
' there is sometimes a note of frustration in the @entity0 's voice when he finds himself fighting a @entity247 - like battle against an incoming tide of modernity , as when he speaks to the @entity251 's @entity250 in a series on @entity1 called @entity253 being shown tomorrow and monday			1
' you 'd think by now we might have learnt a few lessons from the things that have gone wrong , ' he says			0
the @entity0 's house in @entity259 is called the @entity260 and he bought it in 2006 for £ 12,000 @entity259 , where @entity0 bought his first house in 2006 for around £ 12,000 , still looks like the sort of place @entity265 would have recognised			1
there are no pavements , no street lighting			0
ducks and geese waddle down to the stream			0
beyond the reddish tiles of the rooftops are glimpses of unspoilt countryside , without a wind farm or superstore in sight			0
a pipe dribbles water into a horse trough			0
92,043 the number of square miles @entity1 covers , surpassing @entity5 's 88,745 74.45 the official life expectancy of the country 's population of 21.8 million 97.7 the percentage of @entity1 over tha age of 15 who can read and write 4,400 @entity5 businesses worth more than £ 2bn , operate in the country 45 years of @entity292 rule ended with a revolution in 1989 the principal commercial activity consists of village women selling a variety of hand - knitted socks in striking patterns			1
the @entity0 's house is called the @entity260 , after the blue limewash on the facade , against which are set olive - green shutters			1
inside , the courtyard , partly cobbled , is planted with vegetables			0
a vine grows beneath the eaves			0
the furniture consists of old - fashioned painted chests and time - worn wooden benches			0
there are only three bedrooms , two bathrooms and a kitchen			0
the locally embroidered towels and hand - woven throws may be ever - so - slightly reminiscent of an artfully rustic @entity318 photo shoot , but the house is unquestionably delightful			0
at @entity169 , the @entity0 found a farmhouse at the end of a lane where he can walk directly into the meadows and up into woods			1
when i stayed , the morning began with the sound of cowbells , as cattle swayed out from their barns into the pasture			0
we heard them again in the evening , as each animal found her way back to her own barn			0
the nights were velvet - black , their silence only broken by the barking of guard dogs			0
no ringing of telephones disturbed the tranquillity			0
fields of wild crocuses bloomed beside the roads			0
in summer , hay is heaped into rum baba - shaped stacks			0
the @entity0 's guest house in @entity169 ( left ) and its basic interior ( right ) the main cabin , heated by log fires and traditional ceramic stoves , has only three rooms			1
all the furniture - carved wooden beds , 19th - century chairs , an old oil lamp ( converted to electricity ) suspended from the ceiling , even an ancient radio - has been restored by hand			0
it 's cosy , rustic and tasteful			0
as prince @entity0 bounds from the bus to the car that will take him to the airport in @entity10 , he shows no sign of slowing down			1
@entity1 remains a place that he will visit in a private capacity for a few days a year , but its importance to him is more than that			1
wherever he goes , the memory of it goes with him : a place where so many of his most passionately held ideas about humanity 's place in the world are played out in everyday life			0
@entity385 is editor at large of @entity386			0
@entity387 , @entity251 , tomorrow and monday , 2am			0
