' the long road : @entity2 smiles bravely as she is transported to the rehabilitation clinic on july 2nd where is already able to do 200 crunches in seven minutes thanks to a dedicated physical therapist the truth , he revealed in a lighthearted blog entry , is that @entity2 loves the physical therapist at her east @entity5 rehab clinic and is already stronger than a lot of people			2

how many of you can do two hundred crunches in seven minutes ? ' the student 's incredible recovery comes after just weeks after she was finally released from @entity48 at @entity50 's @entity49			0
@entity2 , a humanist psychology student from @entity51 , had been recovering there after a zip - lining accident on may 1st left a rare flesh - eating bacteria known as necrotizing fasciitis , wreaking havoc on her body			2
pensive : according to @entity12 's blog , @entity2 is made to say complete sentences after each repetition during her sessions which include crunches , leg - lifts and other abdominal strengthening exercises sticking together : @entity12 and @entity65 have been building an ' @entity66 ' at their @entity51 , @entity5 home as @entity2 gets stronger in preparation for her prosthetic limbs doctors amputated one of her legs , a foot and most of both hands to stop the deadly bacteria from spreading and during the six week stint , @entity2 drifted in and out of consciousness and on and off life support as doctors laboured tirelessly to overcome the disease			1
now that she has been moved to the rehabilitation clinic , her father says her determination is relentless and has already vetoed his plans to drive her around in a wheelchair friendly van when she returns home			1
fun times : @entity2 is determined to return to life as normal and was outraged by her father 's suggestion that he chauffeur her around in a wheelchair friendly vehicle hippie chic : old photographs of @entity2 show an energetic and active young student who will no doubt be relying on the $ 150,000 prosthetic limbs he parents are hoping to afford to give her the freedom she enjoyed before according to his blog post , @entity2 's reaction on learning about his new automotive purchase was : ' no way ! i am not going to be chauffeured around town like a handicapped person			1
' without relaying his concerns about his daughter 's future driving career to @entity2 herself , proud father @entity12 wrote : ' the simple fact is that between her ears , @entity2 is 100 %			2
she knows that she can accomplish anything she wants and that lacking the hands or feet to accomplish such tasks is only a minor inconvenience			0
' road trip : though @entity12 joked that his daughter was a terrible driver even when she did have all her limbs , his tone turned more serious as he wondered how how she thinks she could drive with her disability both he and his wife , @entity123 , have been hard at work building what they call ' an @entity66 ' onto their home to make sure her life can return to normal as soon as possible and she can get on with studying for her master 's degree			0
the extension will include a bedroom , fitness room , sunroom and study and will be accessed by a special lift built by concerned volunteers			0
in the meantime , the @entity138 have also been trying to raise the funding to buy their brave daughter the $ 150,000 prosthetic limbs that she hopes will allow her to live as independently and actively as before her horrifying ordeal .			0
