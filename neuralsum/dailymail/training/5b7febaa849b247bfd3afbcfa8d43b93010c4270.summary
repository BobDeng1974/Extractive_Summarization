these are the stomach - churning images of a fearless daredevil who risks his life scaling @entity5 's tallest buildings without safety equipment			1
@entity7 , who is originally from @entity8 , has reached the top of skyscrapers in both @entity11 and @entity12 - carrying out his terrifying feats for no reason other than to have fun			2
the 20 - year - old , who calls his hobby ' rooftopping ' , said that he actually finds climbing quite difficult , and strongly recommends others do not to pick up the pastime due to the risks involved			1
unsurprisingly given the difficult climbs he has embarked on - including looking down on the 101 - floor @entity22 - mr @entity7 said he has never been scared of heights			0
instead he simply trusts in his own ability and tendency not to panic , which helps him stay calm while scaling buildings in all weather conditions - even ice covered scaffolding in the dead of winter			0
many of the climbs he has undertaken have been with friends , so that they can aid each other in taking pictures concerns : @entity7 admits his parents are worried about his dangerous hobby , especially when they see his favourite style of shot - looking directly down from a great height with his legs dangling in the frame views over the city : in both this picture and the one below , @entity7 is seen relaxing on @entity11 rooftops without wearing any safety equipment views : @entity7 scales a huge @entity11 skyscraper on a sunny day			2
in the future , he plans to travel around climbing buildings in @entity59 , before one day visiting the @entity60 , which he describes as his dream home preparation : @entity7 says the main attributes to have when ' rooftopping ' are courage , ingenuity , and intuition			0
in this photograph he is seen looking calm while scaling the outside of a building in @entity12 , @entity72 left hanging : mr @entity7 takes an enormous risk , leaving his legs and much of his body dangling over the edge of an enormous skyscraper in snow - covered @entity8 terrfying : as can be seen in this and the following two images taken in @entity12 , @entity72 , @entity7 happily climbs buildings in all weather conditions - even ice covered scaffolding in the dead of winter view over @entity12 : the 20 - year - old , who calls his hobby ' rooftopping ' , said that he actually finds climbing quite difficult , and strongly recommends others do not to pick up the pastime due to the risks involved impressive : mr @entity7 says he likes to take photographs his feet hanging over the edge of a roof ( as in this image and the two below , all taken in @entity11 ) as they demand more from him and are ' quite showy ' pose : the 20 - year - old , who calls his hobby ' rooftopping ' , strongly recommends others do not to pick up the pastime due to the risks involved			1
here he is photographed relaxing on a @entity11 rooftop			0

@entity8 - born @entity7 *regularly* scales the outside of skyscrapers in @entity5 without wearing safety equipment
the 20 - year - old , who calls his hobby ' rooftopping ' is not a *professional* climber and carries out terrifying feats for fun .
in fact he finds climbing difficult and strongly recommends others do not start ' rooftopping ' due to the risks involved
