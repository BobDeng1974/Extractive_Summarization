by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 has tipped @entity3 to follow @entity5 's blueprint and emerge as one of the key forces in @entity8 this season			1
while the enigmatic @entity2 was relaxed about seeing his side beaten 4 - 0 by @entity3 on sunday , he was quick to recognise that @entity12 ' side have the potential to be a threat to all with their slick passing and speed on the counterattack			1
he also sees parallels between @entity5 and the situation @entity3 have found themselves this summer : in the past 16 months , @entity2 has seen his key players @entity20 and @entity22 cherry - picked by @entity23 , while @entity3 have lost @entity24 to @entity25			1
when asked about @entity24 's departure , @entity2 said : ' it seems to be no problem ! they have a plan maybe but i do n't know			1
we can play better than that and @entity3 can play better too			1
' @entity3 is a great club and they did well last year			1
if you make the right decisions after you miss ( a trophy ) you can be stronger			0
maybe @entity3 this year is the big team in the @entity53			2
' we are only the middle of our preparations and on wednesday we have the other match against @entity23 in the @entity58			0
our problem at the moment is not ( missing ) @entity22			0
the players all start at different moments and this was not the ideal time to face @entity3			2
' praise : @entity2 has backed @entity3 to follow @entity5 and be a force in @entity8 @entity2 a feel : @entity12 greets his counterpart after @entity3 's victory @entity70 relishing @entity71 @entity12 described @entity2 as ' an inspiration ' in his programme notes and @entity5 's manager can see some of the way his side have developed in how @entity3 have progressed under the @entity77			1
' we did what we did , when we started we tried to create football moments that will hopefully be more successful than the past , ' said @entity2			2
' we did n't think about what happened in the past , just how we can develop the team			0
that 's what we do at the time			0
' he 's a good manager but i do n't think about things like this			0
he does his job and i do mine			0
' @entity2 , meanwhile , has confirmed there is no possibility of @entity93 – who has just been named @entity5 captain – joining @entity96 this summer			1
' he is going nowhere , ' said @entity2			2
' he is staying with us			0
