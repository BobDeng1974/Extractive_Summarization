no sooner is one problem solved than another crops up			0
@entity2 is discovering , like his predecessors , that the idioms of the @entity6 captaincy translate awkwardly into the one - day			1
not for the first time this summer , this column fears @entity10 cricket is in denial			2
the test team corrected things just in time : @entity2 resolved to get further forward to @entity17 ’s seamers , @entity15 woke up , an unfit @entity18 was dropped , and the senior bowlers got their heads round the idea of an @entity10 length			0
it helped that @entity17 were a rabble			0
but now that @entity6 are faced with eight months of 50 - over cricket – and , at the risk of cheering everyone up , the prospect of a sixth successive @entity27 failure – the merciless truth for @entity2 is that he now faces another set of searching questions			1
limited appeal : @entity2 ( right ) and @entity6 are really struggling in the @entity36 against @entity17 one - day cricket has always left @entity10 cricket navel - gazing and head - scratching			1
just ask @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43			0
it is one of the most tiresome rituals in the modern game			0
and it is deeply ingrained			0
@entity10 cricket prizes the stubbornness that helped @entity2 turn around the test team			2
grit , phlegm and the knowledge that , across a series lasting 25 days , substance will eventually trump style – these are what matter to the @entity10 cricket psyche			2
and they are perfectly attuned to the test match			0
one - day cricket has always been an afterthought , partly because the @entity10 just are n’t on its more flamboyant wavelength			1
the mistake that @entity6 have been making for more than two decades is to imagine that the man chosen to get the best out of the test team – the man who most unflinchingly embodies the grind - ’ em - down school of leadership – can also do the trick in the 50 - over game			1
it was unfair on @entity76 , @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43			0
it is unfair on @entity2			0
curiously , @entity6 ’s most enlightened one - day moment came with the appointment of @entity80 in the late 1990s , a move which briefly allowed @entity40 to concentrate on the @entity6 job			1
@entity6 ’s most recent multi-team tournament triumph came in @entity84 , way back in december 1997 , under @entity80			1
and while the probity of that success has always been the subject of whispers , @entity80 ’s charisma and capacity to free up his players are still spoken of with awe by those involved			1
the experiment did not last long			2
soon after , @entity6 lost one - day series in the @entity96 and at home to @entity98 , and @entity80 was back in the ranks			1
the split - captaincy was considered too radical , @entity80 probably too un-english			1
yet it was his very un-englishness that made him such a vibrant , instinctive leader			0
@entity6 ’s defeats last week at @entity104 and @entity105 were depressingly familiar			1
all @entity106 had to do was bowl his spinners – any spinner would do , even occasional wicketkeeper @entity110 – and he was again being hailed as a puppet - master extraordinaire			2
( truly , it is amazing how short memories can be in sport : a fortnight ago , @entity106 ’s @entity6 humiliation was supposed to have robbed him of his final shreds of dignity			1
) yet to listen to @entity2 ’s explanation for why his team managed only one boundary between the 18th and 44th overs in @entity122 was to play an old and broken record			2
it amounted to this : wickets had been falling too regularly to allow the risky big shots			0
he spoke as if the tumble of wickets was an inconvenience , visited upon his team by forces unknown			0
despite evidence that has been in the public domain ever since @entity135 opened with @entity136 at the 1992 @entity27 – and was reinforced by @entity137 four years later – @entity6 cling tenaciously to the belief that wickets in hand matter above all else			1
dark clouds gathering : @entity6 have limited time to prepare for the @entity27 @entity142 in february for more cricket - related snippets , feel free to go to twitter.com / the_topspin the belated inclusion of @entity147 suggested that , in their heart of hearts , the selectors recognise this for the ante - diluvian thinking it undoubtedly is			1
but even with @entity147 in the current set - up , only he , @entity153 and @entity154 have the capacity to destroy an attack			1
there are too many eggs in too few baskets			0
other teams ’ top six or seven contain no more than one anchorman ; @entity6 ’s has at least two too many			1
and so totals of 230 become the norm			0
once in a while , @entity6 will post 280 - plus – yet even that may not be enough			1
perhaps any attempts at a rationalisation are futile			0
the dressing - room can protest all it likes : one - day cricket simply means less to this country than @entity172			1
when that is the case , minds are not turned to the task in hand with quite the same rigour or vigour			0
lost again : @entity2 and @entity6 trudge off after defeat by @entity17 at @entity105 @entity17 suffer the same problem , but in reverse			1
they seem resigned to their fate in @entity172 matches if the ball is n’t turning , yet fully expect their naturally gifted stroke - makers to chase down any one - day target			2
these expectations become self - fulfilling			2
the decision to stick with @entity2 as one - day captain is yet another example of a combination that has bedevilled our game ever since @entity6 reached the @entity27 final in 1992 : conservatism on the one hand , blind faith in the man whose main job is to lead the test team on the other			1
stubbornness can work well in five - day cricket			1
in the one - day version it may be less useful			2
@entity208 a familiar tune @entity210 thinks @entity6 do n’t have ‘ cat in hell ’s chance ’ of winning the @entity27			1
he ’s probably right – and deserves kudos for commenting so frankly on players who until recently counted among his team - mates			2
but it never ceases to amaze how quickly ex-players make the transition from the field of play to the commentary box			0
often , these same players were among the fiercest critics of the press			0
now , these gamekeepers turn poachers as if it ’s the most natural thing in the world			0
this is all well and good , but can someone please explain to them while they ’re still players that the occasional piece of media criticism does not mean the media are heartless and evil			2
it ’s called doing our job			0
and @entity210 is doing his nicely			0
@entity241 turned poacher : @entity210 ( right ) has been critical of @entity2 and @entity6 damned if he does ... @entity2 was unimpressed by @entity210 ’s comments , leaving some to wonder about the wisdom of the press - conference retaliation			1
this followed @entity2 ’s testy response back in june to @entity249 ’s relentless commentary - box advice			0
but we ca n’t have it both ways : a captain ca n’t be damned for toeing some tedious , platitude - filled party line , then damned for giving an honest answer to a straight question			0
the wheel of life the tendency of most teams ’ fans is to imagine that theirs is the most miserable lot in the world			0
think of @entity17 a fortnight ago and @entity6 last week			2
and now throw @entity264 into the mix after a three - wicket one - day loss to @entity267 moved them from first in the world rankings to fourth			1
surprise victory : @entity267 stars @entity273 ( front left ) and @entity275 ( front right ) celebrate ‘ there ’s probably not enough expletives in the @entity10 language at the moment for the way i 'm feeling , ’ their coach @entity277 said after @entity267 had beaten them for the first time since the @entity280 - inspired heist at the 1983 @entity27			1
‘ it ’s just embarrassing for everyone involved in the touring party , and i hope they ’re hurting			0
’ they ’ll forget it soon enough , and will probably win the @entity27 next year			2
but no result feels more real than the one that ’s just happened .			0

@entity6 play eight months of 50 - over cricket to prepare for @entity27
dual captaincy ( @entity6 and @entity301 ) has never worked for @entity6
their experiment with @entity80 was an enlightened move
only @entity154 , @entity153 and @entity147 can destroy attacks
@entity6 seem to act on a mix of conservatism and blind faith
it *'s* amazing how often *sensitive* players ditch out criticism after *retirement*
