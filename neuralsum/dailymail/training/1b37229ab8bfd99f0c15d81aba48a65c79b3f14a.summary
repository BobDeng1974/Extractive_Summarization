by @entity1 reporter published : 06:11 est , 20 june 2013 updated : 06:13 est , 20 june 2013 desperate to shed its image as one of the world 's rudest cities , @entity2 has embarked on a campaign to improve its reputation and better cater to the needs of tourists			2
waiters , taxi drivers and sales staff in the @entity15 capital all too often come off as impolite , unhelpful and unable to speak foreign languages , say local tourism chiefs , who are handing out a manual with guidelines on better etiquette			1
a six - page booklet entitled ' do you speak @entity23 ? ' contains greetings in eight languages including @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 and advice on the spending habits and cultural codes of different nationalities			1
one of the most romantic cities in the world , @entity2 has now decided to show its tourists some love ' the @entity37 like to be called by their first names , ' the guide explains , while @entity40 should be shaken by the hand and @entity42 reassured on prices			0
of the @entity27 , the fastest - growing category of tourists visiting the city , the guide says they are ' fervent shoppers ' and that ' a simple smile and hello in their language will fully satisfy them '			1
@entity15 is the world 's top destination for foreign tourists , with @entity2 visited by 29 million people last year			0
the business tourists bring to hotels , restaurants and museums accounts for one in 10 jobs in the region and is a welcome boost to the economy at a time of depressed domestic consumption			0
@entity2 's service industry staff have been criticised for not welcoming foreign tourists sufficiently the @entity68 and the regional tourism committee have warned , however , that growing competition from friendlier cities such as @entity72 meant @entity2 needed to work harder to attract visitors , especially from emerging market countries			0
some 30,000 copies of the handbook on friendly service are being distributed to taxi drivers , waiters , hotel managers and sales people in tourist areas from the banks of the @entity84 up to @entity85 and in nearby @entity86 and @entity87			2
setting realistic linguistic ambitions , it suggests offering to speak @entity90 to @entity91 - who it describes as warm and readily tactile and keen on evening excursions .			1

six page booklet entitled do you speak @entity97 ? is being distributed
suggests calling the @entity90 by their first name and smiling at the @entity27
