an enormous impact crater thought to have been created by a meteorite the size of a house smashing into @entity4 has been discovered in the @entity6 ice sheet			1
scientists conducting a routine aerial research flight above @entity9 noticed a strange ring - like structure in the normally flat and featureless ice			1
it appeared to be a series of broken ' icebergs ' surrounded by a 2km ( 1.24 miles ) wide circular scar , surrounded by a few other smaller circular scars in the ice			1
the solar system is teaming with debris of ice and rocks in orbit around our sun. occassionally these come close enough to the @entity4 to interact with the planets atmosphere , causing a streak of light in the sky			2
the debris that makes it to the surface are known as meteroites			0
they can vary in size from tiny grains to large boulders and form impact craters when they strike the surface at between 26,800mph 44,700mph			0
one of the largest meteorite found on @entity4 is the @entity49 meteorite from southwest @entity50 , which weighs roughly 54,000 kg ( 119,000 pounds )			2
scientists predict that a meteorite around 30 - 50m ( 98 to 164 feet ) across is capable of forming a 1km ( 0.6 miles ) crater , will occur around every 1,000 years			1
however , the last impact of this size that we know of took place 55,000 years ago			0
small but potentially devastating events such as the 1908 tunguska impact in @entity61 are likely to occur every few hundred years			0
in february 2013 , a meteor thought to be part of a family of asteroids orbiting around 93 million miles from our sun , streaked across the sky above @entity69 , @entity61			0
it exploded with the force of 500 kilotons at a height of around 18 miles in the atmopshere , creating a bright flash and a cloud of dust			1
it is thought that some fragments made it to @entity4 , however , and small fragments have been recovered from impact craters made in the ice			2
an impact crater created by the meteor that exploded over @entity86 in february 2013 one reported a series of infrasound - low frequency sound capable of traveling huge distances below the limit of human hearing - detected on 2 september 2004			1
six detectors around the world detected this infrasound thrown out by the exploding meteorite , allowing scientists to pinpoint it somewhere over @entity9			1
in a separate study , scientists at @entity100 , @entity102 's permanent base off the coast of @entity9 , reported seeing a dust trail high up in the atmosphere around that time			1
they estimated that the falling object would have landed on the ice shelf			2
the findings suggests that a house - sized meteorite broke up in the atmosphere over @entity9 before the remains smashed into the ice sheet			1
dr @entity115 , a geophysicist from surveying company @entity116 , was the scientist who first spotted the impact crater			0
he said : ' we were on a routine measuring flight near to the coast and we were flying above a small ice bluff			2
' i looked out of the window and saw some unusual structures in the surface of the ice that were some broken ice looking like icebergs that is very unusual on a very flat ice shelf surrounded by a large wing shaped circular structure			1
' i 've never seen something like that before			0
my first thoughts were that it might be an impact structure from something from space like a meteorite			0
' the researchers , who are part of the @entity141 in @entity142 , had been flying on a @entity144 aircraft called @entity145 6 over an area that is known as the @entity147 of @entity148 in @entity9 as part of a survey to study the rock beneath the ice			1
the aircraft , which was flying from the @entity154 , is equipped with ice penetrating radar that can map the geology beneath the ice sheet			0
they were also using magnetometers to measure small disturbances in the magnetic properties of the bedrock to help determine more about the terrain			0
as they flew over the @entity6 coast on 24 december 2014 , dr @entity115 spotted the large circular scar on the @entity168 , which forms over the ocean			1
the team then later returned to the site on 26 december , taking photographs and video of the site as well as using a laser to create a topographical map			0
they also used radar to help build up an image of the interior of the ice shelf beneath the circular structure in the hope of seeing what lies beneath it			0
the remains of the impact site was found on an ice shelf off the @entity147 of @entity9			1
the researchers had flown from princess @entity190 while scientists at the @entity102 @entity193 had spotted debris from a suspected meteorite heading towards the area in 2004 six infrasound stations ( marked by black triangles , detected the noise waves created by the meteor as travelled around the world , allowed scientists to pinpoint the source above @entity9 as can be seen where the lines cross in the diagram above from a research paper in the @entity208 the scientists were flying in a @entity144 aircraft called @entity145 6 ( above ) from the princess @entity211 they are still processing detail but dr @entity214 , a geophysicist and leader of the @entity141 's geophysical survey team at @entity219 , said that it appeared the ice and snow on the top part of the ice shelf had been disturbed			1
he said that this data should help to confirm that it was a meteorite that had caused the crater			0
he said : ' we ca n't say that with any confidence at this point			0
we can say we 've found something very unusual			0
' however , there are two very promising prior results - the infrasound data and the observed dust trail in 2004 - which support the hypothesis that this structure could have been created by a meteorite impact and certainly support the decision to collect more data for further analysis and investigation			1
' the @entity102 study estimates that the body that left the debris they measured would have likely been about the size of a house and that it may have broken up on its way though the atmosphere			2
' interestingly enough , when we flew out to the circular structure in the ice on december 26th , we also spotted a number of smaller circular and sub-circular structures in the ice as well , which is consistent with the conclusion of the @entity102 study			2
' an image from @entity263 ’s @entity262 satellite of the meteor ’s dust trail one hour after it is thought to have exploded above @entity9 in september 2004			1
the dust was spotted by @entity102 researchers in @entity9 at the time geophysicist dr @entity115 , above , spotted the impact crater from the window of the @entity145 aircraft dr @entity115 and his colleague @entity272 ( above ) were conducting a survey on board the @entity145 aircraft research by the @entity102 scientists after they saw the meteorite debris above @entity9 inn 2004 suggested that it was around seven to ten metres ( 23 to 33 feet ) wide and weighted between 600 and 1,900 tonnes			1
they estimated that it exploded in the sky above @entity9 with the force of 12,000 tonnes of @entity283 and was travelling at a speed of 29,080 mph			1
the debris created by the explosion would then have crashed to @entity4 , smashing into the ice			0
dr @entity288 said that the team were now considering drilling down into the ice beneath the crater to see if they can find out more about what caused it			0
dr @entity288 added : ' if this object did break up before hitting the ice shelf , that perhaps some of the pieces were not travelling with enough energy to penetrate the ice shelf , and may have settled on or within it			0
' we may find evidence of a dust layer in the ice surrounding the crater beneath 10 years of snow accumulation			2
i think that would be worth having a look at			0
' the scientists used radar carried in the nose of @entity145 , seen above , to peer through the ice in the crater meteorites hit the @entity4 frequently , but few are big enough to cause any damage and occur in remote areas			2

@entity142 scientists spotted the 2km ( *1.24mile* ) ring on a routine survey flight
the scar of broken ice was found in @entity9 's @entity168
scientists believe it was made by a 7 - 10 m wide meteorite that hit in 2004
researchers in @entity9 at the time reported seeing dust left in the sky
they estimated it had exploded with the force of 12,000 tonnes of @entity283
infrasound stations also picked up the explosion and matched the *location*
