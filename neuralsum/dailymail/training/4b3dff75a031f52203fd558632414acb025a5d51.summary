a mother who was looking over photographs of a family day out was left shocked after discovering the face of a ' ghost child ' next to her children climbing a tree			1
@entity7 from @entity8 , had taken the picture in august of two of her children while on a family outing to @entity12 in @entity13			1
while on the trip , the mother - of - three stopped to snap an image of her two children @entity18 and @entity19 , who were climbing a tree			1
the ghostly figure , circled , which mrs @entity7 discovered after looking over a picture taken on a family day out but after looking back over the picture she discovered the figure of what appears to be a @entity28 child			1
mrs @entity7 , 39 , explained : ' we were on a family walk one afternoon and the kids decided to climb a tree			1
' i stopped to take a photo but it was n’t until i got home that i spotted a child ’s face looking back at me			2
' i could n’t believe it when i looked closer at the picture and there was a child , standing with a wheel or a hoop in their hand			1
@entity7 , who says she has discovered the face of a ' ghost child ' in a family photo ' it has really freaked me out			1
i do n’t like anything like that			0
' i would love to know more about the child in the picture			2
i am convinced it is a ghost , possibly from the @entity57			2
' when you look closely at the photo you can see the deep dark eyes			0
it definitely bares a striking resemblance to the black - eyed child that has been spotted around @entity12			1
' i do n’t think it looks evil though , or like it wants to cause any harm to my children			2
they were both a bit spooked by it at first , but any child would be			2
' now mrs @entity7 is keen to find out more about the history of @entity12 in a bid to reveal who the ' ghost child ' might be			1
she explained : ' i would love to find out more about the history of that area and if there are any experts who can help me out			0
it is a fascinating subject			0
' i have had a lot of feedback from people , and it is split pretty evenly between people thinking it is a little boy or a little girl			0
' different people have spotted different things , such as a hand holding a hoop or a stick			0
everyone sees differently i think depending on what they believe			0
' the full - time carer , added : ' some people have said that i must have used @entity98 but i could n’t tell you the first thing about that , i have no idea how to use anything like that			0
i just took the photo on our family compact camera			0
' but that is most likely just people who are sceptical or do n’t believe in the afterlife , that is always the first thing they say			0

@entity7 took a snap of her children climbing a tree on a day out
later discovered a ' ghost - child ' standing next to children @entity18 and @entity19
says she believes the figure appears to be that of a @entity28 child
adds that it bares a resemblance to previous ghost *sightings* in the area
