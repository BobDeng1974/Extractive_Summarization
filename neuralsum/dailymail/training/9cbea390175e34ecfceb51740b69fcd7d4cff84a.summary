by @entity0 @entity2 , fussy , and at times downright awkward - words most women would acquaint with getting a bra fitted in - store			2
this is what inspired a frustrated @entity9 - native and @entity11 marketer , @entity12 , with the help of a team of scientists , to develop @entity16 , an app that can accurately calculate your bra size using only a handful of carefully posed selfies			1
' eighty per cent of women wear the wrong bra size , ' @entity21 , a representative for the company tells @entity25			1
' our sizing technology is accurate to a half inch which , based on our testing with focus groups , is more accurate than a seasoned tailor using measuring tape			0
' innovation : @entity34 , an app created by ex-google marketer @entity12 , claims it can accurately calculate your bra size using two carefully posed selfies the app uses computer vision technology , which analyzes body size in relation to the @entity44 ’s size - a science that took over a year to perfect under the direction of computer engineer @entity47			1
ms @entity12 started the company a year ago with her husband , venture capitalist @entity49 - a business partnership which works ' really well ' for the couple , according to ms @entity12			0
she was previously a @entity52 marketing manager and before that , she was director of retail giant @entity54			0
with a keen interest in pairing fashion with technology , ms @entity12 hired designer @entity59 , who has been busy producing several lingerie lines for the @entity16 , using its own sizing method , to create bras which start at $ 39 on their website			1
get ready : the process was slightly complicated and took a while to get our head around , but we were guided through it step - by - step by an automated female voice time for a selfie ! the app uses computer vision technology , which analyzes body size in relation to the @entity44 's dimensions fresh take : @entity16 found gaps in industry standard sizing and has designed a range of their own label bras accordingly , which come in half sizes the @entity84 team were highly skeptical that taking a few selfies could produce a ‘ prefect ’ bra size , but i was taken through the process step - by - step by an encouraging , automated female voice			1
a total of two photos are captured in front of the mirror , one from the front and one from the side , and though i stripped down to my bra , as suggested , it is optional to wear a tight fitting @entity101 if you 'd prefer			2
i 'm assured the entire measurement process runs through a computer , not a human , and the photos are stored on a secure , security - audited server			0
i was surprised to be told i was a @entity108 by their sizing , a hop and a skip away from my usual @entity112 , and unfortunately @entity16 politely informed me that they did n't yet carry my slightly unusual size			1
studies have indicated that up to 80 per cent of women are wearing the wrong sized bra , perhaps in part due to the frustrating business of getting fitted properly ' we are just getting started but extending our size range is very much part of our plan , ' ms @entity21 assured me			1
our deputy editor also test - drove the app and had better luck , coming out as a @entity128 and chose a nude , lacy bra for $ 64 from the online store			1
the bra arrived within three days and much to her surprise , and the fit was ' absolutely perfect ' she says , adding that it was incredibly comfortable and really did feel as though it had been molded specifically to her shape			2
entirely sold on the concept , and eager to order again from @entity16 once they stock my size , i spoke to ms @entity21 more about what makes the technology so compelling			1
result : our tester was thrilled with her customized bra , similar to the one pictured , for $ 64 , reporting that it fitted her ' perfectly ' ' we 've done a lot of in - house testing with focus groups and have found that when a human is measuring , there is a high likelihood of human - error , ' she explains , with examples ranging from the placement of the measuring tape , to the customer 's fidgeting or breathing in or out			2
speaking of @entity34 's sizing methods , ms @entity21 points out that the industry standard sizes are ' limited ' and ' there are gaps			0
' many women , our own tester included , apparently fall in between cup sizes			0
the @entity16 app certainly worked for us , but could this really spell the future of bra shopping ? hands on approach : high - end boutique , @entity175 , is skeptical than an app can measure up to an in - person fitting one high - end lingerie boutique chain we spoke to had concerns			1
@entity175 , whose bras cost anywhere from $ 75 up to over $ 250 each , trains its stylists to a high standard and prides itself on its one - on - one customer experience			0
' there is much more to fitting a bra properly than picking up a size , ' @entity186 , a stylist at the @entity188 store explains			1
' even if a woman gets a bra in the correct size , without being shown how to adjust herself , she may think they are fit improperly			1
' ms @entity186 added that educating a woman on how to adjust herself is an extremely important part of the fitting process			2
' it is almost impossible to do this correctly and comfortably without having someone to help you and show you how , ' she adds			0
variation : my stylist explained that there are large discrepancies in women 's sizes and styles offered , so it is best to be assessed by a trained professional in order to find the right bra eager to find out if she was right , i visited the @entity188 intimacy store to get a private fitting			2
having been incorrectly measured recently , with tape i should add , at @entity219 and sold a bra that is far too uncomfortable to wear , i was highly impressed with the service at @entity175			2
aside from the rather unforgiving lighting in the changing room - essential , i 'm told , for getting a good look at me - my stylist was charming and knowledgeable and i learned a great deal from the visit			0
as with the team at @entity34 , she frowned on using a tape measure and insisted that sizing by ( a highly trained ) eye was the best way to go			0
luxury : this tester visited @entity175 's @entity188 store , pictured , and was met with a highly professional and informative stylist and a wide selection of lingerie she explained the importance of getting the straps adjusted correctly ; something i thought i had down , but with a few quick alterations , she transformed how the everyday bra i was already wearing felt and i instantly noticed a shift in my posture			1
she also informed me that one of the most common issues she sees is women wearing the back bands too high on their backs and that ultimately , there is such a disparity between women 's bodies and the different styles available , that nothing can beat an in - person fitting			0
after some lengthy experimentation with a variety of the brands that intimacy stocks , i walked out with a beautiful red set of lingerie for $ 200 and a $ 76 sports bra so unbelievably supportive - my stylist had me doing jumping jacks - that i 'm at least telling myself i will be seeing a lot more of the treadmill from now on			0
pricier option : i walked away with a well - fitted bra and matching panties , similar to the one pictured , which set me back $ 200 while most of us have experienced the discomfort of wearing the wrong sized bra , as far as medical science is concerned , it 's a problem which can lead to more long - term issues			1
many experts have already linked badly fitting bras with poor posture and spinal problems , as well as breathing problems , abrasions and breast pain			0
osteopath and expert voice on the matter , @entity284 warns : ' if a woman is bending forward because of insufficient breast support , the trapezius overstretches and causes headaches			0
' back health : the consequences of wearing an ill - fitting bra have been well documented by the medical community and include back pain , poor posture and even headaches or stomach issues ' all nerve roots come from the back ; so stomach upsets and fatigue are common by - products of bad back health , ' he added			2
having tested both @entity16 ; the high - tech app experience and @entity175 ; the custom bra - fitting service , the jury is still out			1
if you are lucky enough to be one of the sizes thirdlove currently stocks , you could be happily surprised by how well their bras fit , and for a reasonable price			0
if you are willing to take the time to visit one of @entity175 's impeccably trained experts - and to invest substantially more in the cost , your game - changing bra could well be waiting			0
