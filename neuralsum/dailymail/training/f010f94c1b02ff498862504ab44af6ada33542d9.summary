upon her release from prison , home secretary @entity16 wanted to send the woman back to @entity2 , but lost after it was decided that failures by @entity23 social workers had turned the woman into a violent criminal			1
in 1994 , she was sent to @entity23 to join her mother and stepfather but was raped again by her stepfather 's brother and a friend of the family			0
ms @entity39 was then put into care and given a good foster family , but a mistake in paperwork meant that she was removed from there and transferred to a children 's home			0
