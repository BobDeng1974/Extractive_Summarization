' the charity defended its decision , saying they had only sent packs out to a few people in the @entity40 media to draw attention to the dangers of smoking to influential people , including mps			2
each pack costs £ 20 to send out - and they were sent to around 20 media outlets			1
blunder : the charity @entity9 sent out around 20 packs of free cigarettes at a cost of £ 20 each in a statement , a @entity9 spokesperson said : ' it is important to @entity9 that people with influence , such as journalists and mps , have the opportunity to see how brightly coloured and super slim cigarettes are being used alongside packaging to hook young women into a deadly addiction that kills one in two lifelong customers			1
