by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 07:17 est , 11 october 2013 updated : 07:30 est , 12 october 2013 @entity2 is jailed for four years after fooling 73 hospitals into treating him for bogus ailments a compulsive liar cost the @entity6 £ 100,000 by faking illnesses at hospitals across the country for years			1
@entity2 , 69 , was jailed yesterday for four years after a judge said he had fooled doctors and nurses in a ‘ diabolical ’ fraud			1
the conman used at least 25 aliases and said he had been admitted to 73 hospitals on 90 occasions			1
his long and complex history of faking his identity even left his own barrister confused			0
@entity20 said : ‘ i ’m not entirely certain who he is , and i do n’t think anyone actually knows			0
’ when @entity2 was released from one hospital he would simply get himself admitted to another under a false identity			1
he even tried to fool a psychiatrist who was assessing him by feigning a limp and slurring his words			0
@entity2 was also a persistent thief , and in one incident he took a hospital patient ’s wallet while pretending to be a patient himself			1
the brazen scam was finally revealed after he pretended to suffer a stroke on a train in may this year			0
@entity2 , who is officially homeless , walked into the dock at @entity38 on crutches , but the judge said he could still be faking even in court			1
judge @entity41 told him : ‘ our medical resources are vital and they should n’t be wasted in the way that you are having them wasted			1
‘ what can i do ? i ’m going to lock you up for a period of time that gives some respite to the community			0
‘ it ’s diabolical the amount of waste you ’ve created			0
’ he said the resources @entity2 had squandered ‘ could have gone to those who desperately need it ’			1
judge @entity41 added : ‘ the temptation is to lock you up for ever , but i ca n’t do that			2
’ he described @entity63 as a ‘ congenital liar ’ and said : ‘ we ca n’t believe anything he says			0
all custody is going to do is enable him to tell tales in prison , but keep him out of surgeries and hospitals for a period of time			2
’ @entity2 turned up a @entity77 's @entity76 claiming he had suffered a stroke but refused to have an mri scan			1
his barrister did n't recognise him when he arrived at @entity38 a psychiatrist diagnosed @entity2 with a chronic ‘ factitious disorder ’ , which causes people to feign or exaggerate symptoms of illness			1
prosecutor @entity86 said @entity2 was taken to the @entity76 in @entity87 after apparently suffering a stroke and gave the false name of @entity63			1
those resources could have gone to others who desperately need them ' he was kept in hospital and was given various tests , but his behaviour caused concern			2
he was protective and aggressive about his belongings , gave inconsistent information and refused an mri scan claiming he was claustrophobic			0
after his arrest , it emerged he had accessed £ 85,000 worth of medical services using the bogus name			0
@entity2 admitted one charge of fraud by false representation between may 2 and 9 this year			1
he asked for four more frauds , relating to treatment worth about £ 14,000 , to be taken into account			0
mr @entity20 said @entity2 had detailed his history of fake hospital admissions in a letter			2
‘ the list of the hospitals where he has received treatment is quite remarkable , ’ he added			2
‘ it ranges from the very south of the country to the north of @entity123 , something like 73 separate hospitals			1
again , whether it ’s true or not , i ca n’t say			0
that ’s the list he provided			0
‘ i did say to him , “ what would happen if you were released ? ” he said , “ i ’d check into a hospital ”			0
’ @entity2 had 110 previous frauds and 60 thefts on a criminal record stretching back to the 1950s			2
judge @entity41 said : ‘ he ’s just a persistent offender			2
‘ unless he has a damascene moment in prison , he ’s going to come out just the same			0

judge *blasts* @entity2 , who had 25 aliases , for wasting @entity6 resources
' @entity145 ' conman had *accommodation* at the *taxpayer* 's *expense*
*visited* 73 hospitals from south of @entity152 to northern @entity123 90 times
