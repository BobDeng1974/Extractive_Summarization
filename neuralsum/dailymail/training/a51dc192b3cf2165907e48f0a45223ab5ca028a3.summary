it ’s a pioneering crime - fighting technique that could have come straight from a detective drama – and will soon be hitting the streets of @entity3			2
when officers arrive at a crime scene , they will be able to quickly and easily find out whether the perpetrator has left behind saliva , sweat or other bodily fluids with the help of a fluorescent spray			0
until now , finding and analysing these samples – which can help uncover the guilty party ’s identity – has been a complicated and time - consuming process			0
investigation help : the new technology could help police apprehend criminals more quickly by lighting up bodily fluids but once the new ‘ forensic biosensor ’ spray has been applied , it will immediately light up in one of four different bright colours – telling officers whether the sample is blood , sweat , saliva or semen			1
the item can then be sent for immediate forensic analysis to extract dna and , if the offender is already known to the police , help them make an immediate arrest			0
the spray , which uses the latest bio and nano technologies , has been developed by scientists at @entity43			1
it has been in progress for almost a decade and the @entity46 hopes that it will provide police officers with vital leads in the first critical hours of an investigation			0
it will be tested by @entity52 ’s @entity51 in a £ 113,000 pilot scheme , which ministers hope to extend nationwide			2
slow process : previously analysing samples had been a lengthy process , but this technology will speed it up			1

new technology will glow different colours *depending* on which fluid found
process used to take days but this will speed up identification
pioneering technology was developed at @entity43 , @entity52
