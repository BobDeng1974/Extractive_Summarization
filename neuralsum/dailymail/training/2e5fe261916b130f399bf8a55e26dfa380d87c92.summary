tragic : @entity3 's first female bishop , 58 - year - old @entity0 who was elected just this past september , was involved in a fatal crash in which a cyclist was fatally injured @entity3 's newly ordained first female @entity7 bishop fatally crashed into and killed a bicyclist before fleeing just two days after the @entity10 holiday			1
police on saturday said a 58 - year - old female motorist drove away from a scene of mangled metal beside a fatally injured man taking his final breaths -- 41 - year - old father and custom bike maker @entity19			1
a letter from the @entity21 of @entity3 revealed sunday that it was their no. 2 leader , bishop @entity0 , who disappeared from the fatal crash before finally returning to take responsibility			1
meanwhile , photos from the scene can attest there was no way @entity0 could have kept hidden for long the evidence her @entity30 had been in a serious collision			2
witness @entity32 , a @entity33 reporter who covers the @entity34 , described to the @entity35 the collision and resulting damages as ' a massive impact			0
' half the vehicle 's windshield and hood bear deep , fractured indentions from @entity44 's body			0
' @entity46 did leave the scene initially , but returned after about 20 minutes to take responsibility for her actions , ' right rev. @entity45 wrote sunday in a letter addressed to the @entity51 that was obtained by the @entity52			1
it was later revealed she had indeed left the scene but later returned ( her car is pictured here after she went back to speak to police who were still at the scene ) pictured on the sidewalk behind police tape was what remained of @entity44 's ride of choice -- no doubt one of the custom @entity76 he fabricated for a living in his one - man shop			1
reaction to the incident from @entity55 's thriving cyclist community was fast and furious			0
' he was alive after it happened , ' @entity83 told the @entity52 at the scene of the crash on the 5700 block of the city 's @entity89			0
' she might have been able to help or call for help if she 'd stayed on the scene			0
' twisted metal : @entity44 's wrecked bike is pictured here			0
he was left dying in the street for a time before a fellow cyclist happened by and called 911 ' @entity19 was a passionate bicycle builder , a father , and a friend to many people who ride bicycles in @entity105 details of the crash are still emerging , we know the driver of the car involved initially fled the scene , leaving @entity19 to die on the street			1
' @entity0 was pulled over by police in 2010 and booked on drunk driving charges after police found a nearly empty bottle of whiskey in her car , on which the tire had nearly fallen off the rim no details have been released that confirm or deny @entity0 's sobriety at the time of saturday 's crash and it remained unclear sunday night whether @entity0 would face charges of any kind , but state records and a local report from a 2010 arrest indicate the newly ordained bishop has faced drug , alcohol and reckless driving charges once before			1
in september 2010 , nearly four years to the day before she 'd become @entity3 's first female @entity7 bishop , @entity0 was pulled over in @entity136			1
police at the time said she blew a bac of .27 , or over three times the legal limit , when given a breathalyzer			2
in her car , police said they found a bottle of whiskey , a bottle of wine , and a marijuana pipe reported @entity148			1
officers also said one of @entity0 's tires had somehow become shredded			0
however , records show that by january 2012 the drug charges were dropped			1
@entity0 received ' probation without judgement ' for the dui charge			1
according to the law offices of @entity160 and @entity161 , in the state of @entity3 this means : you can truthfully answer you have not been convicted of a crime on job applications , your car insurance does not go through the roof ( if it ’s a @entity167 ) , and ( for certain crimes ) you can get the matter expunged after successfully completing probation			1
the local cycling advocacy group @entity171 released a statement on their friend @entity19 's death , which read in part : ' @entity19 was a passionate bicycle builder , a father , and a friend to many people who ride bicycles in @entity55			1
' while details of the crash are still emerging , we know the driver of the car involved initially fled the scene , leaving @entity19 to die on the street			1
' @entity191 , while placing flowers at a memorial that popped up near the scene , told the @entity52 after seeing photos of @entity0 's damaged windshield , ' there ’s no way you could not know you ’d hit somebody			2
' a community mourns : a mourner places flowers at a makeshift memorial created for @entity44			0
@entity55 's active cycling community reacted quickly and vocally to the tragedy a community bike shop left a touching tribute to @entity19 at the site of his untimely death however , @entity0 is n't claiming she did n't know			1
nor had she said anything else about the matter as of sunday night			0
instead , the diocese was doing the speaking for her and says they have suspended @entity46 because she still may face criminal charges			2
' there is an ongoing police investigation into the accident , ' wrote @entity217			0
' i will meet shortly with the @entity219 to discuss ways we can move forward			0
' @entity222 went on to say that he 'd be postponing an upcoming sabbatical ' to be pastorally present in this difficult time			0
' right rev. @entity45 from the @entity227 dec. 28 , 2014 pastoral to the clergy of the @entity21 of @entity3 dear colleagues , i am distressed to announce that bishop @entity232 was involved in a traffic accident saturday afternoon , dec. 27 , that resulted in the death of a bicyclist , @entity237 , 41			1

please pray for mr. @entity19 , his family and @entity46 during this most difficult time			2
please do not contact @entity46 directly , but feel free to send written notes to the @entity249			0
there is an ongoing police investigation into the accident			0
several news organizations have reported this as a ‘ @entity59			0
’ bishop @entity0 did leave the scene initially , but returned after about 20 minutes to take responsibility for her actions			1
because the nature of the accident could result in criminal charges , i have placed @entity46 on administrative leave , effective immediately			2
i will meet shortly with the @entity219 to discuss ways we can move forward			0
also , i have decided to delay the beginning of my sabbatical to jan. 24 to be pastorally present in this difficult time			0

police say a female 58 - year - old motorist *smashed* into custom bicycle maker @entity19 , 41 , on saturday afternoon in @entity55
bishop @entity232 , who was elected to the no. 2 spot in the diocese in september , was named as the driver by the @entity21 of @entity3
@entity3 records show @entity0 was arrested in 2010 after reportedly *blowing* @entity281 the legal driving limit when police found a bottle of whiskey in her car
@entity0 received ' probation before judgment ' for a @entity167 charge but no charges were filed despite police having found a marijuana pipe in the car
witnesses observed and an official response from the diocese later admitted that @entity46 fled the scene before returning 20 minutes later
@entity44 , whose @entity302 page *proudly* displays his custom bikes , was rushed to a nearby *hospital* before *succumbing* to his injuries
