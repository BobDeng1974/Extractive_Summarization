by @entity0 it might just be a small brick bungalow that looks like it could do with a bit of modernisation			0
but this single - storey home , which cost just £ 8,500 around 40 years ago , is now back on the market - with an asking price of nearly £ 1million			2
the three - bedroom property has one reception room , a kitchen , a utility room and a 1970s - style bathroom			1
high price , low roof : the bungalow in @entity15 , south @entity16 , is on the market for £ 985,000 close to two public schools and a large park , it is located in @entity15 , @entity16 , opposite the house @entity21 lived in after she left @entity22 in 1990			1
with prices rising to their highest levels in more than a decade , the bungalow is now on the market for £ 985,000 – the cost of a six - bedroom @entity29 - listed house in @entity31			1
and for £ 1million a buyer could have a seven - bedroom detached house in @entity35 , complete with swimming pool			1
when the property ’s owner was asked if he was surprised by its value , he said : ‘ no , it was a des res area when i bought it 40 years ago and it still is			2
‘ @entity21 lived over there , as her husband loved to play golf and the @entity15 course is close			2
’ roomy : the reception area is spacious but would benefit from being redecorated outdated : the flat features this 1970s - style bathroom but a neighbour said : ‘ it ’s hard to get planning permission around here because we live in a conservation area and the committee is very strict , so extending might be difficult			0
’ they added : ‘ @entity60 prices have gone crazy , but especially around here			0
i could n’t believe it when i saw that it had been advertised for close to a £ 1million			0
‘ i do n’t know who in their right mind is going to pay that for a bungalow			0
