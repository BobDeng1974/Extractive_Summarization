by @entity0 for @entity1 follow @ @ marthakelner as he dutifully performed @entity4 before the race , you would not have guessed @entity6 was consumed by nerves			1
yet he admitted feeling very vulnerable before his hard - fought 10,000m gold last week			1
@entity10 ’s personal battles over recent months have given that victory extra significance			1
so to win the 5,000m title today and scoop a second gold would help eliminate the self - doubt he has felt after health scares and relative failure			2
‘ i ’m not invincible , ’ said @entity10 , ‘ i ’m just a human being and sometimes you doubt yourself when things are not going quite so well			1
there are times when i ’m struggling and going through different emotions			0
success : @entity6 wins the 1000m final at the @entity26 in @entity27 two weeks ago i pulled out the @entity29 and i was n’t sure if i was going to be all right for the @entity30			1
you ask yourself questions ; “ am i ready ? ” physically , you might be ready but mentally you might not be			0
‘ it would be awesome if i could do the double in @entity27			0
if i can run a good race and similar to what i ’ve run to previous years , then i ’d know			0
i ’d say “ yes , you are on the right track			0
’ four years ago this week in @entity27 , @entity10 became the first @entity38 to run under 13 minutes for the 5,000m			2
it confirmed his world - class credentials			2
he calls it a ‘ magical place ’ and it would be more special if he can harness the wonder of the venue to get back on track			0
only human : @entity10 said that he is not invincible and sometimes is filled with self doubt victory : @entity10 enjoyed success after having to pull out of the @entity29 in @entity52 @entity10 has been reminded of the fragility of his career by his setbacks			1
he laughs when asked when he will be going back to the marathon			0
‘ i have n’t thought about the marathon yet ! ’ @entity10 regrets turning to training for the @entity61 after winning the distance double at the @entity63 in @entity64 last year and his competitive debut over 26 miles was a disappointment as he finished in eighth			1
@entity10 has also endured some ‘ scary ’ moments this year			1
he collapsed after the @entity70 in march and points to four stitches in his left ear sustained when he collapsed after a training run in @entity76			1
‘ it gives you a different outlook on life , ’ said @entity10 , ‘ if it was just myself then you would n’t think too much about it , but i ’ve got kids , i ’ve got family			2
that ’s when you think a lot and say to yourself , “ wow ”			0
’ @entity10 plans to continue for four or five more years before retiring to spend more time with his family			2
but his focus is now on the 5,000m final			0
‘ it would be good to show all my opposition , everyone who knows i ’ve been ill , that i ’m back , ’ he said			0
