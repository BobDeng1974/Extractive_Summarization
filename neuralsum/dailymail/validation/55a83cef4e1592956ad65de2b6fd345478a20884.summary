@entity0 has been told his future lies at @entity2 even though manager @entity3 has left him out of his last three match - day squads			1
@entity0 started the season on fire with three goals in as many @entity9 games and was reported to be in international contention when @entity12 manager @entity11 paid a visit to the @entity14 in september			1
but @entity0 's form has tailed off since that blistering start and he is now behind fellow widemen @entity18 and @entity19 in the @entity14 pecking order			2
@entity0 ( left ) should stay at @entity2 despite his recent absence from the side , says @entity3 the 27 - year - old winger has even failed to make the bench for @entity2 's last three games against @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 but @entity29 explained that was down to him changing his customary 4 - 3 - 3 formation to one featuring a midfield diamond			1
' these are very difficult decisions for me , ' @entity3 explained			2
' @entity0 had a fantastic start to the season , he had a little dip and then he came back a bit			2
' he has probably been a bit more inconsistent but he has still contributed fantastically to the team			0
there are no problems whatsoever with @entity0			0
' he is one who does deserve to be in match - day squads but unfortunately with the way things are sometimes that is n't always possible			1
' the formation we 've been playing dictates the bench , you have to look what you need and there are normally three or four players who miss out			0
' @entity3 has said it has been difficult to leave @entity0 out and feels he deserves to be in be in the match - day squads @entity0 has made over 200 league appearances for @entity2 since signing from @entity3 's former club @entity60 in a Â£ 400,000 deal in 2009			1
the @entity63 - born winger helped the club win promotion to the @entity9 in 2011 and has been a consistent performer in the top flight - and @entity3 insists he still has a big part to play at @entity2			1
' i have known him since he was 14 and watched his career , i know him better than probably anyone else in the squad , ' @entity3 said			0
' @entity0 has contributed a lot this season , he is a fantastic player to work with and someone who is at a very good level			2
@entity29 has known @entity0 since he was 14 and says he knows him better than any other member of his squad ' he is a big part of what i am doing here but there are moments within seasons where you miss out			0
' we have four good wide players in @entity89 , @entity18 and @entity0 and @entity90 coming through , they are all different types who can contribute different things and selection depends on who we are playing and how the players have trained			0
' these decisions are never easy - it 's probably the hardest part of the job - but i am always honest with the players and i think they respect that			0

@entity0 has been left out of @entity2 's match - day squads of late
@entity0 started the season well but has since seen his form *decline*
@entity3 says it has been a difficult decision to leave @entity0 out
but he sees his future as being at @entity2 despite the absences
