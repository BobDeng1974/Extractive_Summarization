by @entity0 @entity1 bumps and scrapes are a normal part of life for most boisterous toddlers			1
but for one little boy even the smallest of knocks can cause his skin to tear and blister causing him excruciating pain			1
@entity1 , known as a ‘ butterfly boy ’ , was diagnosed with recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa ( @entity4 )			1
his condition is so severe a simple act such as lying on his bed can cause his extremely thin skin to tear			1
the toddler , who is 21 - months - old , struggles with everyday tasks such as putting on clothes , because the task can cause painful blisters			1
there is no cure for @entity4 and his parents @entity30 and @entity33 , of @entity34 in @entity35 , can do little to make life easier for their son			1
mrs @entity39 , a payroll administrator , 29 , said : ‘ it ’s really upsetting to see @entity1 in pain			1
‘ he ’s a young , active boy and we do n’t want to stop him from experiencing everything a boy his age should			0
but he has to be very careful			0
‘ he stumbled on to his bed once recently and the bed sheets caused a nasty blister on his face			2
‘ if he falls or knocks himself no matter how minor , he will always end up with a wound			0
he screams and cries in pain when we have to change his dressings			0
‘ it is hard because he does n’t understand that he has to be put through pain to make him better , otherwise the wound will only get worse			0
’ one in 17,000 people suffer from some form of @entity4 , and infants with the condition are commonly nicknamed ‘ butterfly children ’ , because their skin is very fragile like a butterfly ’s wings			1
healthy skin is formed of three layers , but @entity1 is missing the middle layer , which holds the inner and outer layers together			1
in august 2012 , just days after he was born , the identity band around his ankle caused a small blister - the first sign something was n’t right			2
mrs @entity39 said : ‘ everything went so smoothly with the pregnancy and the birth			0
but soon after we noticed a blister on the back of his heal			0
warning : graphic content @entity1 , who is 21 - months - old , struggles with everyday tasks such as putting on clothes as it can cause painful blisters ( pictured ) there is no cure for @entity4			1
healthy skin is formed of three layers , but @entity1 's is missing the middle layer , which holds the others together			1
this means that his skin tears easily and painful blisters common for the toddler			0
nasty blisters can be seen on his shoulder and ear ( pictured left ) and thumb ( right ) mrs @entity39 , pictured here with her husband @entity98 and their son , said : ' it 's really upsetting to see @entity1 in pain			1
he 's a young , active boy and we do n't want to stop him from experiencing everything a boy his age should			0
but he has to be very careful ' @entity4 ( @entity4 ) is a general term used to describe a group of rare inherited skin disorders that cause the skin to become very fragile			1
any trauma or friction to the skin can cause painful blisters			0
@entity1 has the rarest form of @entity4 where blistering occurs at the junction between the epidermis and the dermis			1
in most cases , the symptoms of @entity4 are obvious from birth			2
it is caused by faulty genes inherited from one or both parents			0
there are many cases when both parents are carriers of the faulty gene without realising it			0
just one in every 17,000 children has it			0
there are thought to be 5,000 people living with @entity4 in the @entity135			2
there is no cure for @entity4 so the treatment aims at preventing blisters becoming infected			2
‘ it was n’t until more began to appear that we started to worry			0
‘ the dressings used to treat the blisters became a problem too , pulling more skin off when they were removed			0
‘ my husband saw the initials ' @entity4 ' on the nurse ’s notes when we took @entity1 to hospital about it			1
‘ we did the worst thing you can do at this point			0
‘ we soon realised this was a serious condition and could affect @entity1 ’s quality of life			2
’ it was n’t until march 2013 , when @entity1 was four - months - old , that doctors confirmed a diagnosis of @entity4 following lengthy testing at @entity162 ’s @entity161			1
mr @entity1 , 30 , a senior development manager and mrs @entity39 are both carriers of the @entity4 gene			1
if they had another child , there is a one - in - four chance they would also suffer from the condition			2
‘ it was agonising waiting to find out if @entity1 had @entity4 , ’ mrs @entity39 said			1
‘ those first weeks and months are when parents can enjoy their new - born child and to have this hanging over our heads was tough			2
‘ it can take up to 30 minutes to change @entity1 ’s dressings and it has to be done at least twice a day			2
‘ there is the risk of blisters forming on his eyes , if he itches them too much			0
' this is dangerous because it could potentially affect his sight			0
’ mr @entity1 is raising money for @entity190 , a charity which supports families and sufferers of @entity4 by taking part in the @entity194 this year			1

@entity1 's hands are easily cut and blistered and his mother said : ' it can take up to 30 minutes to change @entity1 's dressings , and it has to be done at least twice a day ' there is the risk of blisters forming on @entity1 's eyes , if he itches them too much			2

@entity1 , from @entity34 in @entity35 , has recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa ( @entity4 ) which causes his skin to blister and tear
healthy skin is formed of three layers and @entity1 is missing the middle layer , which holds the inner and outer layers together
simply getting dressed can cause the 21 - month - old excruciating pain
it took doctors four months to diagnose the condition , which has no cure
