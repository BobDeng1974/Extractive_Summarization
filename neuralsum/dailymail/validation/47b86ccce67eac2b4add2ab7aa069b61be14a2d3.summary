a ski resort has issued the @entity1 with a bill for half a million dollars after six fraternities and sororities staged a huge party that tore apart the hotel in an @entity8 - style melee			1
originally , it was estimated the college students caused around $ 75,000 damage at @entity12 during a ski trip in january			1
but a full assessment of the 45 rooms and connecting hallway - which was stripped of its ceiling - plus the loss of revenue , and damage to the brand 's reputation has seen that figure multiply by six			2
and according to @entity24 , general manager of @entity12 in @entity25 , the fraternity that originally apologized for the damage - @entity27 - is refusing to pay up			1
however the @entity38 resort is not revealing pictures of the damage			2
above , a wrecked room at the @entity12 where members of @entity27 and @entity31 stayed the weekend of january 17 legal action : it 's estimated that both parties resulted in a combined $ 75,000 worth of damage			1
both resorts are looking into pressing charges @entity49 told @entity50 : ' the destruction done to @entity12 by @entity1 fraternity and sorority students in mid-january is now near or beyond $ 430,000			1
' while an investigation is ongoing , the university has stated that they expect the students who are responsible to make full restitution to @entity58 for the damages			0
' it also has become evident that the fraternity representatives have suggested that they are unwilling to pay for the damage that they caused the resort			1
' he also called on @entity31 to contribute to the payment , which includes cleaning fees			2
shocking pictures of a ski resort wrecked by members of a @entity1 fraternity earlier this month are only half the story			1
it turns out , members of several other @entity78 life organizations from the @entity79 , @entity74 school held a similarly debauched rager at a another hotel that same weekend			0
combined , the damage done to @entity38 resort from january 16 -18 is also estimated to be worth tens of thousands			2
since then , the six fraternities and sororities implicated in the two parties have been suspended by their national organizations while the university and police investigate the incidents			2
video from @entity92 on @entity93 punishment : all of the fraternities and sororities implicated in the parties have been put on suspension by their national organizations which means they wo n't be allowed to host parties or represent their groups on campus historic : @entity24 , the manager of the @entity12 , says the 45 rooms be rented to the groups were left in ' the worst condition ' he 's ever seen in his 30 years in hospitality scene : above , the @entity27 ( left ) and @entity31 ( right ) houses at the @entity1			1
the fraternity and sorority are accused of wrecking their rooms at the @entity12 in @entity25 @entity27 chapter president @entity114 previously said his members ' are embarrassed and ashamed of the behavior ' of some members			1
he said that his fraternity ' accepts full responsibility ' and ' will be working with the management of the resort to pay for all damages and cleaning costs '			1
' this behavior is inconsistent with the values , policies , and practices of this organization , ' @entity125 said			0
' we will work within our own organization and with university officials to hold those who are responsible accountable for their actions			0
' similar charges may also be brought up by the @entity137 here members of @entity139 and @entity140 fraternities held another party that same weekend in conjunction with the @entity145 and @entity146 sororities			1
resorts spokesman @entity147 said that the group booked rooms in two blocks , and caused an estimated $ 25,000 in damage by breaking furniture and doors , soiling carpet and upholstery , punching holes in walls and smoking in non-smoking room			1
@entity160 said they are not releasing images of the damage , since the management company does not own the building and publishing the pictures would be a violation of their landlord 's privacy			0
ruined : above , the @entity38 resort where members of the @entity140 and @entity139 fraternities held a similarly destructive party with the @entity145 and @entity146 sororities a spokesman for @entity38 says one block of rooms was more destroyed than the other			1
above , the @entity139 and @entity140 fraternity houses at @entity1 @entity140 and @entity139 allegedly rented out two blocks of rooms at @entity38 with members of the @entity145 ( left ) and @entity146 ( right ) sororites ' one of the group 's units was far worse than the other , ' @entity160 told the @entity187			1
' obviously our owners are not pleased			0
showing this level of extreme disregard to our properties is ridiculous			0
we will be looking at implementing new policies when it comes to young people booking at our properties			0
' in addition to possible criminal charges , @entity160 says they will be looking into getting payment for the time they could n't rent out the damaged condos			0
it 's believed that members of even more @entity1 fraternities and sororities may have been involved in both parties			1
suspension by their national organization means the members of the six fraternities and sororities involved may continue to live in their campuses houses but can not participate in social activities , including holding parties or representing their organizations at university functions			1
they also wo n't be able to vote in @entity78 life councils			0
university spokesman @entity220 says the suspension gives the university and authorities time to investigate the incident and determine appropriate action			0
' it 's more important to make sure we get the right information and move forward following our established processes than to do it by a specific deadline , ' mr @entity220 said			0
the university community has expressed scorn at the way the fraternity and sorority members represented their institution - ranked one of the top public colleges in the nation - during the out - of - control weekend ski trip			2
' these incidents simply do not reflect the @entity1 's values or its expectations , ' said @entity245 , vice president for student life			2
' the behaviors are a contradiction of what it means to be in and of a community , and we do not believe that being away from campus is a license to act in destructive and irresponsible ways			0
' three student body leaders also reacted to the incident this week			0
the joint letter from student body president @entity259 , @entity261 president @entity260 and @entity263 president @entity262 wrote that the parties were ' an act of shocking disrespect '			0
' we , as leaders and @entity269 at the @entity1 , do not tolerate these kinds of acts , nor do we let such behavior fall under the radar			2
we intend to handle this situation with the utmost efficiency , and we will ensure that those responsible for the damage to the properties will be held accountable throughout this process , ' the statement reads .			0
