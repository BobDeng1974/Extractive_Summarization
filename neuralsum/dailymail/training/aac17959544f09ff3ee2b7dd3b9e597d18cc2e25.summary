@entity102 may sing about @entity103 in @entity104 but she is actually originally from @entity105 in north west @entity106			0
the area was ranked number 10 in the top 10 for musically talented areas in the @entity8 after analysing the answers , results concluded that musical skills and ability are not evenly distributed across the population and that ability can be linked to a person 's profession , education level and income			1
