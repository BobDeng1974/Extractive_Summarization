if his pr machine is a reliable source of information , @entity1 's dear leader @entity0 is constantly touring his domain offering his ' field guidance ' on everything from missile launches to mushroom farms			1
after five years at @entity12 's @entity11 , the despot is no doubt a highly efficient technocrat			0
but these pictures show him working on a problem he can really sink his teeth into - food			2
appearing jovial in most pictures , the 32 - year - old first secretary of the @entity38 chatted happily to staff and henchmen , who eagerly took down his advice in tiny notebooks			0
however , he turned serious when confronted with the final packaged products , staring pitilessly at bottles of soft drinks and squatting down on his haunches to get a closer look at cellophane - wrapped snacks			0
as white - coated aides peered nervously over their @entity0 's shoulder , he took one package of unidentified multi-coloured sportspersons ' foodstuff in hand and glowered at the rest			2
the fate of the snacks is not known , but it is understood that the supreme commander of the @entity58 has a prodigious appetite			0
i 'll have these delivered to my country retreat : @entity0 talks to factory managers in front of stacks of bottled soft drinks - which from afar look curiously similar to capitalist equivalents available in the @entity68 next time i want a white coat that does up : factory bosses scribble notes as @entity0 - who is a graduate of five years military officer training school - pronounces on the best way to run a food factory resisting temptation : @entity0 keeps his hands stuffed firmly in his pockets as he peers into a storage bin that looks like it contains thousands of crisps that assembly line workers are toiling to make in the background last september , after @entity1 admitted @entity0 was ill , rumours swept the world that the tubby tyrant may have gout - a condition linked to an overindulgent lifestyle that is historically known as ' the disease of kings '			1
@entity0 has rapidly gained weight since coming to power after his father died of a heart attack in 2011 , photos released by state media show			2
@entity1 observers have speculated that @entity0 's weight and family background may have contributed to his apparent gout			1
as pictures emerged today of @entity0 contemplating foodstuffs for sportspersons , on the world stage former senior @entity102 officials met with @entity1 's chief nuclear negotiator in @entity108			1
@entity109 , director of the @entity110 at the @entity111 , a @entity102 - based nonprofit , said the meeting would cover the @entity1 's nuclear missile programmes			1
he said : ' it 's two ways of taking each other 's temperature			0
' i like this place : @entity0 grins , although his aides are beginning to look rather uncomfortable behind him you can all live , except the old guy ! the aide pictured far right looks particularly unhappy with the visit the @entity102 and @entity1 have no formal diplomatic ties , but former @entity102 officials occasionally meet the @entity1 's diplomats in a bid to settle the impasse over @entity12 's apparent pursuit of a long - range nuclear missile that could hit the @entity102 mainland			1
@entity12 is thought to have a handful of crude nuclear bombs and has conducted three nuclear tests since 2006			0
but experts are divided on how far the opaque government has come in the technology needed to miniaturise a warhead			0
pictures of tyrant @entity0 's tours of his domain 's nuclear weapons facilities have as yet not been released by @entity1 state media .			2

@entity0 visited the @entity24 for @entity25
his interest in *healthier* food may be as a result of his rumoured gout
meanwhile , nuclear talks begin again with @entity102 *statesmen* in @entity108
