by @entity0 the photo that sealed his fate : 24 hours after @entity5 police circulated this photo of @entity7 they discovered that he was a fantasist @entity10 's ' forest boy ' paid the price for his web of deceit in a @entity15 court today as he admitted fraud			1
@entity7 tried to hoodwink the world by masquerading as an @entity19 - speaking orphan called @entity20 who was brought up in the wilderness of central @entity22			1
the 21 - year - old was today ordered to perform 150 hours of community service after a hearing in @entity15 held behind closed doors			1
the @entity27 took less than an hour to deal with @entity29 - born @entity28 , who stayed on in the @entity5 capital after his hoax was exposed last year			0
the @entity29 's story story began in september 2011 when he pitched up at a @entity15 town hall speaking broken @entity19 and claiming to be an orphan			1
he said his mother @entity35 had died in a car crash five years previously and that he had lived since then with his father , also called @entity20 , in woodland			1
he said his father had died in the woods and that he had buried him and then ' walked to @entity15			2
' the fact that his clothes were clean and he looked as if he had survived on more than foraged berries and nuts for half - a - decade did not stop authorities from providing him with shelter - particularly as he said he was underage			0
@entity28 soon became a sensation across @entity22 , hailed as the the boy with no memory who had lived like a modern - day mowgli			2
people from across the world claimed him as their own			2
for eight months he lived at the expense of the @entity5 taxpayer , racking up a bill of £ 25,000 for benefits including pocket money , clothes and dental treatment			1
then in june last year the charade fell apart when @entity5 police took a photo of him , circulated it and discovered within 24 hours that he was a liar			1
the forest boy had morphed into a lying @entity29 overnight			0
' you got me , ' @entity28 said to police who came to evict him from the children 's home where he had stayed			0
it turned out he was a disaffected @entity29 youth with a complicated home life and an illegitimate child in his home town of @entity78			0
he simply wanted to disappear off the radar and start a new life			0
possessions : the bag @entity28 was carrying when he ' emerged from the woods ' and appeared at a @entity15 town hall			2
he said his mother had died when he was 12 and he had lived in the wilderness with his father left without a word : the house of the @entity28 's father in @entity78 , the @entity29			2
a court spokesman said today that the 21 - year - old had made reference to a difficult home life , but did not elaborate further court spokesman @entity95 said he will avoid a criminal record if he agrees to the community service order			1
he said that @entity28 had made references in court to the ' difficult home life ' that had lead him to concoct his fantasy world , but did not elaborate further			0
' there was no conviction , as all parties in the hearing agreed			0
he admitted his guilt , and agreed to the 150 hours of community service , ' said mr @entity95			1
' if he fails to carry out the work it will come to a trial and probably a conviction			0
but as it stands now he will not have a record going into the future			0
this kind of agreement is made in the interests of young people 's future			0
' last year , after he was booted out of care , he was pictured flipping hamburgers at a @entity122 restaurant in @entity15 but he has since quit his job			1
' this is the price for @entity20 's lies , ' crowed @entity15 's @entity127 paper after @entity28 was handed down the community service order			1
but in the end he got away without having to pay back a penny to local authorities .			0

@entity7 arrived in @entity15 in 2011 speaking broken @entity19
he claimed his name was @entity20 and he *'d* lived for years in the wilderness
*social* services took him in and he racked up a £ 25,000 bill for care
but 24 hours after circulating his photo police discovered he was a fraud
today he was *sentenced* to community service after admitting his crime
