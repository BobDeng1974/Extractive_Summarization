by @entity0 published : 11:09 est , 9 december 2013 updated : 12:35 est , 9 december 2013 two prisoners who shared fantasies of killing someone disembowelled and attempted to behead a fellow inmate with a weapon made out of razor blades and plastic cutlery they 'd been given by guards			1
the body of convicted child rapist @entity11 , 23 , was found with severe neck and eye injuries and a slashed open abdomen after fellow inmates @entity16 , 25 , and @entity17 , 34 , attacked him at high - security @entity18 in @entity20			1
today , as the inquest into @entity11 's death opened at @entity24 in @entity20 , a jury heard how the killers - who had intended to eat their victim 's liver but decided not to at the last minute - had a cup of tea and a cigarette afterwards before asking a guard to open the cell door			1
@entity17 , 34 , left , and @entity16 , 25 , attacked inmate @entity11 , 23 , with a homemade weapon @entity34 coroner @entity34 , warned the jury today that the details of the death would be ‘ gruesome ’ , ‘ graphic ’ and ‘ distressing ’ , but urged them to ' never lose sight of the fact that this was a real person and someone ’s son			1
' it emerged that the prisoners attacked @entity11 , who was serving an indefinite sentence for raping a 13 - year - old girl , with a home - made knife they 'd made out of disposable razor blades and a plastic knife			1
@entity51 , acting deputy governor at @entity18 , told the jury that at the time of the killing in october 2011 , the number of disposable razor blades and plastic knives given to prisoners was not monitored			1
he said : ' we issue them with toiletries and disposable razor blades			2
at the time of mr @entity11 ’s death there was no restriction to the number of disposable razor blades			1
' we provide them with everyday items so they can live as normal life as possible , but because of the people we work with , an everyday item can become a lethal weapon			0
' mr @entity51 said : ' if a prisoner said " i have snapped a fork " we would routinely issue them another one and then it would be down to the knowledge of staff			0
@entity11 , 23 , died after he was attacked by two prisoners at @entity18 in @entity20 in october 2011 ' if it was on a repeated basis we would take note of that			1
' @entity11 ’s mother , father and step - father attended the inquest but showed little emotion as the disturbing details of their son ’s death were recalled			2
giving evidence , detective chief inspector @entity95 told the inquest how @entity16 and @entity17 planned to kill a fellow prisoner , apparently chosen at random			1
he said : ' some weeks previously they decided how they would like to kill somebody within the prison system - they had got themselves quite excited by that			0
' he [ @entity11 ] thought he was going down there [ to @entity16 ’s cell ] to keep watch while @entity16 and @entity17 engaged in some sexual activity			1
' he was immediately attacked by @entity16 on the bed and the door was shut by @entity17			1
' he asked for a pen from @entity17 and he put the pen into his left eye			2
' he then looked to cut his head off			0
he certainly tried to do that by putting the knife into the neck on several occasions			0
' @entity16 then cut down the middle of the stomach			2
' there was some suggestion that they wanted to take his liver out and actually eat his liver			0
' there had been a further suggestion to cut a t along the waistline			0
they did n’t like what they saw and decided against that			0
' they then decided to have a cup of tea and a cigarette prior to asking for the door to be opened			0
' the inquest jury heard that prisoners were given disposable razor blades and plastic cutlery at @entity18 the killers then informed the senior officer on duty what they had done , and gave similar accounts of what happened in their subsequent interviews , the inquest heard			1
it was said that @entity11 , @entity17 and @entity16 were classed as ‘ vulnerable ’ prisoners because their crimes made them a target to others on the wing			1
@entity16 was serving a sentence for the murder of two women in a @entity162 nursing home and @entity17 had been convicted of attempted murder			2
speaking of the risk posed by @entity16 and @entity17 , mr @entity51 said : ' neither were particularly high on the radar			2
' some of the information submitted through security information reports had indicated that both prisoners had issued some threats to both staff and other prisoners			0
' in context we could have 50 to 60 at the time who had threatened to kill and , without minimising these threats , we try and take each one on an individual basis and take appropriate action			0
' many are just comments in the heat of the moment			0
' the inquest is expected to conclude later this week			0
sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
