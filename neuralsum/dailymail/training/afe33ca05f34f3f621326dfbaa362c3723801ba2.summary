@entity2 target @entity0 says he can not see himself leaving @entity3 in january			1
the @entity4 international is out of contract in the summer and has so far failed to agree terms on a new contract			0
he is free to talk to foreign clubs in january and @entity3 want an answer otherwise they will look to sell rather than lose him for nothing			1
however , @entity0 said : ‘ right now , i can not see any reason why i would leave the club this winter			2
this club has a place in my heart and there is absolutely no reason for me to say that i want to or have to leave			0
‘ i get the feeling i am still wanted ( by coach @entity27 )			1
’ the 27 - year - old recovered from tearing his knee ligaments to play a part in @entity3 ’s 10th @entity32 triumph , yet he took the bold decision to drop out of the @entity34 final less than two months later when beset by another injury			2
@entity0 still believes that @entity3 coach @entity27 still wants him at the club ‘ i would make the same decision if i had to again , ’ @entity0 said			1
‘ but the moment i realised that i could not play - that was by far the toughest and saddest moment of my career			0
‘ i had to fight with my body , my condition and with myself as a person , ’ @entity0 said			2
‘ i was just really empty and drained			0
i needed a bit of time before i really recovered			0
’ @entity0 made two brief appearances in @entity3 ’s first two games of the season before a muscular injury ruled him out for six weeks			1
he has since made two substitute appearances in @entity52 , but was left out of @entity27 ’s squad for the win over @entity55 last weekend , raising doubts that he had a future at the club .			0
