by @entity0 published : 03:55 est , 19 july 2013 updated : 18:35 est , 19 july 2013 like any thoughtful citizen , @entity1 always stops to pick up stray crisp packets and sweet wrappers in her local park without expecting any thanks			2
but when she paused to brush away some excess fur from her two dogs while she was walking there , the jobsworths pounced – and handed her a £ 50 fine for littering			2
two council wardens told mrs @entity1 , 46 , she had committed an offence after they spotted her brushing her golden retriever @entity15 and @entity17 shepherd @entity18			1
@entity1 brushed the coats of golden retriever @entity15 and @entity17 shepherd @entity18 in a @entity22 park but was fined £ 50 by council wardens for littering it was one of the hottest days of the year , and grooming her pets helped to cool them down			1
mrs @entity1 says she was then prevented from clearing up the hair and claims the two officers drove off without clearing it up themselves			1
the mother - of - two from @entity31 in @entity32 said : ‘ i spend so much time cleaning up litter in parks the fact that i have now been given a fine is ironic – they never see you do any good stuff			2
‘ i always leave the dogs ’ hair out in my garden for the birds and i have n’t met a single person to say anything against it			1
’ mrs @entity1 , pictured with @entity18 , said she always leaves dog hair out in her garden in @entity31 for the birds the incident unfolded when mrs @entity1 was waiting for her son to finish football practice at @entity55 , @entity22			1
she claims the park wardens pulled in front of her car as she tried to leave			2
she says one ‘ blocked ’ her car door to stop her getting out to clear up the hair as his colleague took a photograph of the evidence			1
mrs @entity1 said : ‘ i have owned dogs for over ten years and have never heard of such a law			1
@entity67 was fined by council wardens in @entity69 for clearing up another dog 's mess instead of her labrador @entity73 - even though she cleaned that up too @entity1 is not the first victim of over-zealous council officials			1
earlier this week it emerged a woman was fined £ 75 after she fed a piece of pastry from a pasty to a pigeon and then binned the packet in @entity85 town centre			0
the council has since backed down over the fine			0

the year before , @entity93 was issued with a £ 75 fine for dropping a piece of sausage roll while feeding it to her young daughter			0
a judge hearing her appeal in @entity100 later threw the case out			0
‘ i ca n’t deny it was n’t a lot of hair , but it looked far worse when it was all spread out			0
‘ what has disappointed me most was he was going to give me that fine no matter what – even though i offered to clear it up			0
’ mrs @entity1 said the park officers then sped off without binning the hair , which she put in her car to throw away at home			1
she added : ‘ obviously this was all about the money and not cleaning up the environment			0
