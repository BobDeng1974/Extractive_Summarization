by @entity0 @entity1 , 27 , had her bladder removed after a late cancer diagnosis for most brides - to - be , the big decisions are where to get married and what sort of dress to have			1
but less than two months after @entity1 's boyfriend , @entity9 , asked her to marry him , she was discussing treatments for the aggressive cancer that had been detected in her bladder			1
@entity1 , a 27 - year - old primary school teacher , had been back and forth to her gp with painful cystitis since 2010 , and every time she 'd been told it was an infection			1
but in november last year , she found out the cause was in fact a tumour , and it was so advanced she would need to have her bladder removed			1
' when i first went to my doctor i just thought i had a urine infection , ' says @entity1 , who lives in @entity21 , @entity22 , with @entity9 and their two dogs			1
' i had a burning sensation when i went to the toilet and a bit of pain			0
i was given antibiotics and that worked			0
' but the symptoms kept coming back			0
i went to my gp a few times , and would be given antibiotics , which seemed to shift it			2
sometimes i 'd try and deal with it myself by drinking lots of water and cranberry juice			0
' then , last august , @entity1 was alarmed to see a lot of blood in her urine			1
' i 'd never had that before , and it was completely bright red , ' she says			0
' even then , the @entity32 took my sample and said " oh dear , you 've got a terrible @entity45 "			0
' a uti - a urinary tract infection - is a general term used for an infection of the organs that make or get rid of urine , such as the bladder , the kidneys and urethra , the tube that carries urine out of the body			1
common symptoms include pain when urinating , needing to go more often , urine that is cloudy or strong - smelling and sometimes blood in the urine			0
half of all women will have at least one @entity45 in their lifetime , compared with about 12 per cent of men			0
' men have a longer urethra , so bacteria is less likely to reach the bladder , ' explains @entity70 , professor of urological surgery at the @entity72			2
' whereas infections are quite common in women , who have a short urethra			0
' while a urinary tract infection is the most likely explanation for blood in the urine and needing to urinate more frequently , these can also be signs of bladder cancer , which otherwise has few symptoms			1
and this overlap is a major reason why women with bladder cancer are less likely to get a timely diagnosis , according to researchers from @entity90			1
in an analysis of national cancer statistics last year , they found women with the disease - the @entity97 's seventh most common cancer - were nearly three times as likely as men to have made three or more visits to their gp before being referred for investigation			1
' when i first went to my doctor i just thought i had a urine infection , ' says @entity1 ' the problem is bladder cancer is not at the forefront of a gp 's mind for women , because it 's still more common in men and the symptoms of bladder cancer mimic urinary tract infections , which are more likely in women , ' says professor @entity70			1
@entity1 went back to her gp a week after first seeing the blood , and by then , she also had excruciating pain in her lower back and on the left side of her abdomen			1
' a different doctor prodded my back , which made me scream			0
so he said i should be sent for an ultrasound as i probably had kidney stones			0
' it was this ultrasound that detected the tumour			2
she underwent a cystoscopy , where a camera is inserted into the bladder on a fine tube , which confirmed the diagnosis , and had surgery to remove the tumour last november			1
all the while , doctors assured her that it was likely to be a non-aggressive cancer			2
as professor @entity70 explains , there are two main types of bladder cancer			1
' the majority are non-invasive , and limited to the lining of the bladder			2
this type is not life - threatening and we treat that by scraping it away , then directing chemotherapy into the bladder itself , usually as a one - off treatment			2
the proportion of gp consultations that are for urinary tract infections ' around a third of bladder cancer cases will be aggressive , having spread to the muscle and sometimes the fat around the bladder			1
this type will require complete bladder removal - known as a cystectomy - or radiotherapy			2
' in @entity1 's case , the biopsy results a week later revealed that the cancer was aggressive , and it had invaded the muscle and fat around the bladder			1
she needed chemotherapy as soon as possible - and to have her bladder removed			1
like it could n't really be happening , ' @entity1 recalls			1
' in a few months , i 'd gone from being an apparently healthy person , to being in and out of hospital for three cycles of chemotherapy , planning surgery to take out my bladder			2
' i had to give up work temporarily because chemo weakens the immune system , and i could n't be around my pupils in case i caught anything from them - i teach year 6 and missed them terribly			0
' it 's a heck of lot to come to terms with , ' says @entity1			1
' @entity9 has been brilliant , though , he 's been very practical and positive			0
when i 've had a bit of a wobble , he 'll say " ok , have a cry , but in five minutes we 're going to talk about how you 're going to get through this "			0
' although bladder cancer is more common in men , particularly older men - the average age of diagnosis is 68 - women , who account for around a third of cases , have poorer survival rates			1
just 50 per cent of women with bladder cancer are still alive after five years , compared with 58 per cent of men with the disease , according to @entity210			1
she had to give up work temporarily because chemo weakens the immune system late diagnosis is a major factor			0
' a man with blood in his urine is more likely to be referred to specialist , as utis are rarer in men , and blood in the urine can be a symptom of an enlarged prostate , ' explains professor @entity70			0
another problem is that blood in the urine may be hard to spot at first			0
it can be quite subtle - only slightly streaked with red , or even brown - looking			0
the blood comes from the tumour or surrounding tissue			2
' this blood can come and go as a tumour will bleed intermittently , ' says dr @entity235 , a gp in @entity236 who also works as a urologist			1
' so it may seem antibiotics for a suspected urine infection have solved it			2
' bladder cancer can mimic symptoms of a urinary tract infection such as needing to urinate more frequently , a burning sensation or feeling the need to go , but it can also cause a uti			1
' a tumour can affect your bladder 's ability to empty - and this will predispose you to bacterial infection because bacteria are n't expelled from the urinary tract as efficiently , ' says professor @entity70			1
' so , with bladder cancer you may have a bacterial infection as well , which will respond to antibiotics			1
' dr @entity235 points out that ' for the majority of patients , blood in the urine will have a much more innocent cause '			0
however , he says you should always see a doctor about it ; and repeat @entity268 , especially in conjunction with another new symptom such as urgently needing the loo or lower back pain , should be investigated			0
the main cause of bladder cancer is exposure to chemicals and toxins , which are stored in the bladder			1
the biggest culprits are cigarette smoke and chemicals used in heavy industry			0
' there is an attitude that if you 're not male , you 're not a smoker or not over 70 , it 's probably not bladder cancer , ' says @entity289 , founder of the charity @entity290			2
' but it can happen to anybody			0
' @entity1 knows this only too well			2
' no one can really understand why i got it - i was young , fit , a non-smoker - and female , ' she says			0
in april , @entity1 had her bladder removed			1
although she was offered surgery to form a new bladder using part of the bowel , she 's opted instead for an external bag			2
' i just could n't face more surgery , and i was told the reconstruction surgery can have to be repeated , ' she says			0
' i wanted to get on with my life			0
' because surgery for advanced bladder cancer removes the nearby lymph nodes , urethra , womb and cervix , @entity1 will not be able to have children			1
but she refuses to feel sorry for herself			0
' how could i ? this surgery has saved my life , ' she says			0
once she 's recovered from surgery , @entity1 will have more chemo			2
for now , she is determined to get on with planning her wedding in april			0
' i had to put off wedding dress shopping , but i plan to go this summer			0

@entity1 , 27 , from @entity21 , had been to her gp with painful cystitis since 2010
thought it was an infection , but in nov 2013 she found out in was cancer
tumour in her bladder was so advanced she needed to have organ removed
