@entity0 was beamed across the giant screens inside @entity3 ’s big yellow box of noise before the game			1
he had been given an electronic makeover , tendons lit up in green to give him a robotic , other - worldly feel			2
it was part of an advert for a new @entity13			2
a predator ? not really			2
it will take more than a few fancy sci - fi graphics to turn @entity0 into a predator			1
it is not his style			2
he has not scored a goal for @entity21 since april			1
he has never scored away from home for the club			2
out of this world ? not really			2
robotic ? not in a good way			2
@entity0 was substituted in the 62nd minute after another disappointing performance for the @entity27 the @entity28 international looks dejected after @entity30 scores for @entity3 the £ 42.5million signing from @entity32 failed to live up to his price - tag at the @entity35 @entity0 's lack of influence is perfectly demonstrated by his sparse heat map former @entity40 ace @entity39 struggled to get to grips with playing in @entity42 former @entity40 boss sir @entity43 forked out £ 28.1million to bring @entity39 to the @entity44 in 2001 however @entity39 's stay at @entity46 lasted just two years as he was sold to @entity47 for £ 15m @entity39 ( @entity40 ) - 11 goals in 82 games @entity0 ( @entity21 ) - 7 goals in 45 games ' instinct takes over ' promised adidas			1
the game kicked off and @entity21 froze			1
little more than an hour later , @entity0 was replaced by @entity57 with the @entity58 already two down			1
during that time he had never quite got to the pace of the game			2
it was not only @entity0			1
in fairness , other high - profile team - mates were struggling to cope ; overwhelmed by the frenetic tempo and intensity of @entity3			2
@entity21 could not get the controlled possession in midfield which might allow @entity0 or @entity67 to sparkle			1
but there are times when you look to the big players to produce something special to change the rhythm of the game			0
@entity67 has done it at times this season			0
@entity77 must have hoped this would be the occasion when his £ 42.5million record produced him a flash of magic to give his team a grip on a difficult game			1
last season , when @entity0 was faltering after a promising start in north @entity87 , @entity77 claimed this would be the season when he came into his own			1
he would , the manager claimed , be the @entity92			0
however , there are no signs his @entity21 career is about to transform			1
he is drifting down the path of @entity39 , unquestionably gifted but perhaps not cut out for the way an @entity42 team want to play			1
@entity77 must choose between @entity57 ( left ) or @entity99 ( right ) @entity100 made his @entity21 debut in the @entity102 against @entity3 on tuesday @entity103 failed to hit the back of the net despite having chances to score his first @entity21 goal who wants a play - maker who can not influence the game ? at some point soon , the @entity21 boss must consider whether to cut his losses			1
does he reshape his team to play him in a more central position ? or drop him			0
is he better off with @entity57 or @entity99 ? he is certainly not short of options in this position			0
such a move may damage @entity0 ’s confidence			1
or it may jolt him into life			0
it must be worth a try			0
he was not inspired by his return to his native @entity126 , down the road from @entity128 where he was born and bred			0
instead , he suffered another night of anonymity			0
for most of the first - half , he could be found on the right wing , with teenager @entity100 making his first start for the club behind him at right - back			0
@entity100 ’s accelerated promotion was the result of a sequence of minor mishaps which regularly seem to befall @entity77 ’s squad and he could probably done with someone slightly more industrious and protective ahead of him			1
that was @entity77 ’s choice			2
@entity21 boss wenger was left disappointed by his side 's poor performance in @entity146 video disappointed @entity77 bemoans counter-attacks @entity146 seem to get by with @entity0 on the wing			1
they won the @entity150 with him there			0
perhaps they have more defensive solidity elsewhere to compensate			0
@entity21 are fragile and , in @entity3 , many of the early problems from the areas occupied ( or not ) by @entity0 and @entity100			1
the defensive shift is not his strength			0
so , perhaps , he could turn the game with a waft of his left boot			0
there were neat touches , as ever			0
when @entity77 claimed at the weekend , after a draw against @entity165 , that @entity0 ’s class shines through when he studies a replay of the game			1
he alluded to the weight of his pass and his decision making			0
there was one moment in the 18th minute , when he slid a low cross unerringly to @entity103 in the penalty box , but it came to nothing			0
there was a delicious long - range pass to @entity67 , who had drifted offside			0
at times , he made the difficult things look easy			0
at other times , he made the easy things look difficult			0
@entity0 was not the reason @entity21 lost in @entity3 but his inability to influence the game is becoming a problem @entity77 has to address .			1

@entity21 star @entity0 again failed to live up to *expectations*
@entity77 forked out £ 42.5million to bring the midfielder to @entity21
@entity0 , like former @entity40 and @entity47 star @entity39 , is struggling to get to grips with @entity42 *football*
