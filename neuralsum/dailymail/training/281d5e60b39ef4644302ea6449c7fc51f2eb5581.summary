paving the way : @entity0 is the first bank to put chips on credit cards as oppose to magnetic strips and other financial institutions are likely to follow replaces the strip : the chip has as the same data at the magnetic strip but it encrypts and changes card information with each transaction making it difficult for people to replicate the cards @entity35 reports that each time the card is used the transaction information changes making it difficult to copy the card			1

the chip acts as the magnetic strip normally on cards and uses a pin number that when verified allows for a transaction to take place
the chip encrypts then changes data after every transaction and makes it difficult to replicate the card and prevents fraud
other financial institutions are likely to follow suit and card companies like @entity57 have given stores until october 2015 to allow for chip cards
if stores do n't pay the $ 1,000 *fee* to allow for @entity4 cards , credit card companies have threatened to pass expensive fraud liability to stores @entity147 does n't affect consumers or credit card companies as much at it affects stores liek @entity81 who was a recent victim of a massive data breach
