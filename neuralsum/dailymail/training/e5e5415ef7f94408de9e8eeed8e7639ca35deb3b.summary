by @entity0 climate change could cause a tourism boom in the @entity3 , with cruise ships benefitting from melting ice caps giving them increased access to the area , according to a leaked @entity9 report			1
the draft report - which has been dubbed ' alarmist ' by one @entity12 author involved - claims climate change could help the grey and killer whale populations and increase whale - watching trips to the area			0
it will also mean longer summer seasons , with ships being able to pass through key areas which are often frozen for much of the year , according to the report by the @entity23 ( @entity23 )			0
new routes : cruise ships could benefit from the melting ice caps in the @entity3 region , the controversial @entity9 report has claimed the @entity29 , above @entity30 , and @entity31 , above the @entity32 and @entity33 , will be open for a total of 125 days a year by 2050			1
currently , the waterways are only clear of ice for around 50 days a year			2
the melted ice will mean a more easily navigable shortcut between @entity39 and @entity40 , according to the report by the @entity23 ( @entity23 )			0
and cruise ships will be able to benefit by running more tours to countries including @entity44 and @entity33			2
however , tourists on those ships wo n't be able to see polar bears in their natural habitat - which are in grave danger of disappearing in certain areas as @entity51 warms - or witness the traditions of the @entity54 people , who stand to lose their hunting customs due to changes in their environment			1
local wildlife : while there will be more cruises , the chances to spot endangered species like polar bears will become more limited the report , which is currently being drafted by scientists in @entity65 ahead of being released official , states : ' loss of sea ice may open up waterways and opportunities for increased cruise traffic and add to an already rapid increase in cruise tourism			1
' it adds : ' climate change has increased the prevalence of cruise tourism throughout @entity44 , @entity78 , @entity79 and @entity33 because of decreasing sea ice			1
' the @entity23 will publish its first update in seven years on the impacts of climate change and scientists have been meeting this week to agree the wording of the final document , which will be used to inform policy decisions of governments around the world			0
opportunity : there will be more cruise opportunities for tourists and chance to spot whales , says the report however , professor @entity96 , an economist at the @entity97 , said fellow @entity9 academics were exaggerating climate change and comparing it to the ‘ apocalypse ’			0
he has since refused to put his name to the report			0
@entity3 cruises have increased in popularity in recent years , with more and more ships plying the northern waterways and reaching areas that ca n't yet be discovered by plane and car .			2

waterways will be clear of ice for longer summers by 2050
there has already been a *significant* increase in @entity3 cruises
@entity44 , @entity78 , @entity79 and @entity33 would benefit from more tourism
however polar bears and @entity54 traditions could be lost due to changes
