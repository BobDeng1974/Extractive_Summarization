by @entity0 we are hooked on perfection - and it is the @entity4 supermarkets that tricked us into addiction			1
my blood boiled this week when @entity9 executive @entity8 claimed fussy shoppers were forcing food suppliers to throw away millions of tons of blemished fruit and veg			1
that is sheer hypocrisy and highly manipulative			2
if the public are not buying less - than - perfect produce , it is because we have been trained for decades to reject it			1
generations of shoppers have been hoodwinked into believing food can not taste right unless it is an ideal shape and colour			1
fussy eaters : shoppers have been hoodwinked into believing food can not taste right unless it is an ideal shape and colour if anything , the opposite is true : by forcing fruit and veg to match a fantasy image , growers are breeding all the flavour and aroma out of the produce , often leaving us with good - looking pap that tastes of nothing			1
it is driven by the cult of supermarkets			1
where once we had a mass of small retailers , with busy green - grocers on every @entity48 in the land , now we have four supermassive conglomerates - @entity9 , @entity51 , @entity52 's and @entity53			1
between them , they account for more than 80 per cent of the fruit and veg sold in @entity58			2
the problem has been growing since the @entity60 , and now it is out of control : all they care about is their profit margin and the dividend they pay to shareholders			2
whatever their adverts tell you , do not believe for even a minute that the superstores care about us			2
to them , the public are simply the people who make them rich			2
and the casualties are colossal			2
they create waste at every stage , and we all pay for that : it is madness to throw away up to three - quarters of the food this country produces			1
yet that is what is happening : farmers dump half their food because it does not meet the arbitrary standards of supermarket buyers , and then consumers chuck away half of what they buy - because it does not last as long or taste as good as they 'd expected			1
some of the wastage beggars belief			2
during last summer 's cherry glut , i visited an orchard where the pickers were boxing up tonnes of the fruit but setting aside all those that had been deemed to be the wrong shade of red			1
still taste good : but would you buy these misshapen carrots ? you might think a cherry is a cherry , but no ; if the colour does not match the supermarket 's stipulated hue , they will be rejected			1
at best , the unwanted fruit will go to food processors to be made into jam or pie fillings , or be sold at wholesale markets where standards are not so exacting			1
sadly , most of the fruit will be dumped : it might be delicious but it is useless			2
a farmer in @entity124 who grows cauliflowers told me this year that a burst of sunshine at the wrong time can be disastrous for his crop			2
in the warm weather , the white hearts of his caulis turn slightly yellow , and that is all it takes for his vegetables to fail the supermarket buyer â€™s test			1
he will have to plough the whole crop back into the ground - good for nothing but fertiliser			1
if that sounds crazy , you will not believe the problems forced on egg producers			2
any egg that is slightly too large has to be rejected			2
you would think they could be marketed as ' extra value eggs ' - get more for your money ! one producer told me that for several weeks each year , his hens lay eggs that are a darker shade of brown than usual			1
until the colour goes back to normal , he has to shut up shop : the supermarkets do not want them			1
search for perfection : food is being wasted as a result i refuse to believe there is a single shopper anywhere in @entity58 who has strong views about how brown an eggshell should be			1
part of the problem is that the supermarket buyers are far from being experts			1
they are novices , constantly rotated between different departments			0
this year 's apple buyer might have been in charge of loo roll procurement last year			1
that means they have no specialist knowledge , no close relationship with the farmers , and no passion for any particular product			0
what they do have is a quarterly target			0
they know exactly how much produce their department will have to shift if they are to keep their jobs			0
to give themselves the best possible chance of hitting their targets , they will be ruthless about buying only the produce that customers are proven to buy : the fruit and veg that looks perfect			0
the @entity203 and the @entity204 think we are insane			0
when they go shopping , they pick up their fruit and inhale the aroma			0
they do everything but bite into it - they want to know it is going to taste as good as possible			1
@entity58 supermarkets hate us to touch the fruit			0
we might scratch it or bruise it			0
that is why so much on the fresh counter is wrapped in plastic			0
the packaging projects a subliminal message : smell does not matter , flavour does not matter ... looks are everything			0
to intensify the message , we are bombarded with ' food porn ' , pictures of glistening fruit and veg that is unnaturally perfect			1
looks are everything : this carrot would n't make it on to many supermarket shelves instead of tempting us to try delicious flavours , we are being taught to desire food that looks like it is made of wax			1
the advertising teams know it is easier to persuade us to desire shiny gleaming things than to educate us about real food			1
people do not naturally go for knobbly fruit and veg , especially when it carries negative labels like ' misshapen '			0
every now and then the supermarkets go through the motions of stocking imperfect produce			0
they label it ' wonky ' or ' ugly ' , words to inspire us to shop out of pity			0
and when we do not buy it , they blame us			0
if we protest , they blame @entity261			0
there have certainly been plenty of mad diktats from the @entity265 about how fruit should look , but most were scrapped in 2009			0
if they wanted to , the @entity268 could have us queuing up to buy misshapen produce			0
they have talked us into buying chickens bulked up with water and steak pies bolstered with horse meat - how hard can it be for them to sell an undersized mango ? for example , they could offer packs of winter vegetables with a recipe for soup on the wrapper			1
all carrots look alike once they are chopped and in the saucepan			0
or they could sell bags of discoloured , but succulent , strawberries with the slogan ' @entity289 for jam ! ' that way , we 'd all win			0
farmers would sell more , less food would be wasted , and prices would come down			1
but some serious re-education is needed			0
it could take five years for a new generation to be taught that food tastes better if it does not look like plastic			2
however , the supermarkets display almost no interest in education - and there is another problem			2
it takes oceans of pesticide , fungicide and fertiliser to grow unblemished fruit			0
every insect that might dare nibble a leaf or bore a hole has to be sprayed out of existence			0
the irony is that a lettuce that has been chomped by a caterpillar can not do you any harm - but the damage to the countryside from pesticide sprays is widespread			2
these chemical products make billions for manufacturers , and the chemical giants that develop and market them are powerful			0
they have a vested interest in making sure @entity58 does not get the urge to go organic and start eating wonky carrots and knobbly apples			0
for them , the bottom line is money			0
but for the shoppers , it is much worse : the bottom line is that we are being tricked into eating flavourless , chemical - sodden fruit and vegetables			1
and paying extra for the privilege .			0

they believe food can not taste right unless it is an ideal shape and colour
