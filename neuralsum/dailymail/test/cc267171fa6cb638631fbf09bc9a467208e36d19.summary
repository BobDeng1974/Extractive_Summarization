@entity2 ’s @entity1 spacecraft has survived a hair - raising encounter with comet @entity4 after the probe ran into difficulties during a recent flyby			1
on saturday the spacecraft had dipped to within nine miles ( 14km ) of the surface to take a closer look at the jets that are being ejected from its surface			2
but during the manoeuvre , @entity1 lost sense of where it was due to the amount of dust and gas and was placed into ‘ safe mode ’ , causing it to momentarily lose contact with @entity23			1
the @entity2 's @entity1 ( illustrated ) has survived a hair - raising encounter with comet @entity4 after the probe ran into difficulties during a recent flyby			1
@entity1 launched into space in 2004 and entered orbit around @entity30 in august 2014 ‘ not the best month to choose to go dry … ’ @entity1 project scientist dr @entity31 quipped on @entity32 , as the team back on @entity23 sweated over the safety of the spacecraft			1
the problems arose due to @entity1 ’s limited vision owing to the amount of material it was flying through			2
the spacecraft uses two star trackers to work out where it is in space , in addition to a sun sensor , navigation cameras and three laser gyroscopes			2
crucially , the star trackers allow @entity1 to know where it is with respect to the sun and @entity23 , so it can correctly orient its antenna to send and receive signals from ground stations on our planet			1
the @entity1 probe , which was carrying @entity60 , launched into space in 2004 , using the gravity of @entity23 and @entity62 to slingshot its way towards comet @entity4			1
it chased comet @entity30 through space for more than ten years , and entered orbit in august 2014			0
after a four billion mile ( 6.5 billion km ) journey , the probe then successfully released the @entity60 lander from its grip to land on the comet on 12 november 2014 , travelling at 3.3ft ( one metre ) per second relative to the comet			2
but when it first made contact with the surface it failed to fire harpoons that would have kept it attached to the comet			1
this resulted in it bouncing to a height of 0.62 miles ( 1km ) above the comet before again landing on the surface			0
it then bounced again , but to a much lower altitude			0
@entity60 managed to perform more than 90 per cent of its goals before running out of power			0
@entity1 , meanwhile , is continuing to orbit and study the comet			2
from data collected by the two proves , @entity2 said that water on the comet was different to that on @entity23 - suggesting water on our world came from an asteroid , not a comet			1
when the star trackers are not working properly , the antenna drifts , causing communications to be temporarily lost			1
and during the recent flyby , the spacecraft started to mistake comet debris for stars , causing it to lose sight of @entity23			1
the spacecraft autonomously attempted to readjust itself but struggled due to its close proximity to comet @entity107			0
@entity2 said that ‘ hundreds of “ false stars ” were registered ’ and it took nearly 24 hours before the spacecraft could properly start tracking again			1
during this dramatic event , the antenna had become mis - aligned with @entity23 , so that only a very weak radio signal was being received			0
once the tracking system was restored , the off - pointing was immediately correct and the operations team on the ground saw a return to full signal strength			0
some issues with ‘ false stars ’ were still occurring , though , and attempts to eradicate them caused the same problem to occur			0
this time , the spacecraft but itself into ‘ safe mode ’ to preserve its safety , during which it switched off its science instruments to replace them			0
@entity2 said it took until monday to get the spacecraft back into ‘ normal ’ status			2
on whether the problem could cause @entity1 to lose permanent contact with @entity23 if it happened again , dr @entity31 told @entity135 that they were ' looking at ways to minimise this from happening			1
' ‘ plans for the future are being discussed now , ’ he added			0
he also said they had been ‘ flying at a very low relative velocity to the comet to reduce the chance ’ of any lasting damage being caused by debris			1
the spacecraft is now performing a wide sweep around the comet , giving engineers ample time to make sure the problem does not occur again			1
' we are looking to examine the best way to mitigate the chance of re-occurrence , ' said dr @entity31			0
the spacecraft completed a manoeuvre yesterday that will bring it from about 250 miles ( 400km ) of the comet to within 90 miles ( 140km ) by wednesday next week			2
the spacecraft uses two star trackers ( shown in red ) to work out where it is in space , in addition to a sun sensor , navigation cameras and three laser gyroscopes			0
the star trackers allow @entity1 to know where it is with respect to @entity23 , so it can send and receive signals			1
the high gain antenna is in the background @entity1 was tasked with studying the jets coming from its surface ( shown in image )			0
it is hoped that continuing studies like this could reveal what the comet 's interior is composed of - but engineers will be hoping that this ' false stars ' anomaly does not occur again this diagram shows an example of @entity1 's recent flyby trajectories at @entity107			1
the spacecraft completed a manoeuvre yesterday that will bring it from about 250 miles ( 400km ) of the comet to within 90 miles ( 140km ) by wednesday next week the purpose of flying in so close is to examine @entity107 's geysers			1
these jets are formed when ice on the surface sublimates - or vapourises - and they become more active as the comet approaches the sun. it is getting closer and closer over the next few months , with its point of closest approach taking place in august			0
as it becomes more active , @entity1 has a fantastic opportunity to sweep through the increasingly large jets and gather data			0
studying the jets could reveal vital data on how gas and dust flows out from the surface , and it could also reveal the connection between the comet ’s atmosphere - its coma - and the surface			0
despite the drama , @entity2 was still able to release some amazing images recently taken by @entity1			1
this stunning scene was created from two @entity1 frames acquired at 12 miles ( 19.9 km ) from the comet centre on 28 march			2
the scale is about 1.7 m / pixel and the image measures 3.1 x 1.7 km the latest images include ones of @entity23 and @entity62 which were taken when the probe was attempting ‘ gravity assist manoeuvres ’ in which it used other planets to slingshot its way towards the comet			2
pictured is @entity62 as seen by @entity1 in 2007 as the comet gets closer to the sun , scientists will also be hoping to hear from the @entity60 lander on the surface			2
the washing machine - sized @entity60 probe gripped the imaginations of the world when it landed on comet @entity4 on 12 november 2014			1
but after making two unscheduled bounces on the surface , the probe landed in an unknown location and ran out of power			0
now , as the comet approaches the sun , it is hoped that solar rays will recharge @entity60 ’s batteries and bring it back to life			0
as the comet approaches the sun , it is hoped that solar rays will recharge @entity60 ’s batteries and bring it back to life			0
shown is one of the first images returned by @entity60 on the surface , showing what appears to be the probe on its side wedged in darkness against a cliff			0

@entity2 's @entity1 spacecraft temporarily lost contact with @entity23
the problem occurred when flying just nine miles above comet @entity4
comet debris caused the probe to lose track of its position in space
but after a nervy 24 hours , engineers successfully made contact again
