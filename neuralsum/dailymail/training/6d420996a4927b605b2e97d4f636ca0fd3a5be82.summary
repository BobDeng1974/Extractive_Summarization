@entity77 says police will want to check whether or not @entity0 was unwittingly caught on one of @entity12 ’s cameras as he allegedly assaulted @entity40			1

she said : ‘ i believe it ’s true			0
when i first arrived at the mansion i was told by the other girls - when they told me about the house rules – they said there were cameras in most of the rooms , including the master bedroom			2
‘ @entity12 installed the cameras to make sure he did n’t get sued , you know , to show that no one was in there unwillingly			1
‘ i was taken upstairs to the second floor and there was a whole room full of surveillance that i walked by			0
‘ it made sense , it ’s a business running there			0
‘ the cameras were pointing inside the house not just outside			2
’ @entity131 , 44 , wrote a book called ‘ @entity161 ’ , a shocking , behind the scenes expose of what goes on upstairs at @entity12 's mansion			1

‘ i go up to the house at least four times a year and although i ’ve never seen any i have always suspected that we were on camera			0
‘ i remember attending a luncheon there and @entity12 ’s son told us his dad was n’t joining us because he was unwell			1
‘ but his son said @entity12 would be “ listening in ” , that ’s as far as my knowledge goes , but i took that to mean the room had equipment to record what was going on			2
’ @entity187 added that it would ‘ make sense ’ for @entity12 to have the home wired up in case anything happened that he later needed to check			1
@entity187 , 71 , was 19 when @entity45 picked her as @entity193 for september 1963			0

the star then went to get her an alcoholic drink , but soon after drinking it , @entity40 claims she started to feel ‘ foggy ’ and ‘ sick ’ and @entity0 offered to show her to a bedroom where she could rest			1
