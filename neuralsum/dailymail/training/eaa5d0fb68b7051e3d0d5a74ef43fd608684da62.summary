by @entity0 @entity1 cemented his status as one of the brightest grand prix stars to emerge from these isles after equalling a long - standing record posted by arguably @entity8 's finest ever driver			1
in securing his 33rd career pole during saturday 's rain - hit qualifying session for the @entity12 @entity11 , @entity1 matched the great @entity14 's @entity8 record			1
it is a tally that has stood for almost half - a - century , with @entity14 claiming the final pole of his career in his final grand prix appearance at the 1968 season opener in @entity20			1
the @entity21 was killed in a devastating @entity23 crash at @entity24 only three months later			0
it took @entity1 131 races to reach the landmark			2
the 29 - year - old racer is now fourth on the all - time list with only @entity27 ( 45 ) , @entity41 ( 65 ) and @entity42 ( 68 ) ahead of him			1
a furious @entity26 vowed to ' have a word ' with @entity44 after accusing the @entity46 man – in no uncertain terms – of blocking him during qualifying			1
@entity26 , who was disqualified from the season opener in @entity50 following a fuel - sensor issue , roared over the team radio : ' get this f * * * * * * @entity46 out of my way '			2
the @entity50 's foul - mouthed rant goes against his rather pleasant off - track demeanour where we have become accustomed to seeing him boast the widest smile in the sport			0
but the race stewards were quick to side with the @entity64 driver dishing out a three - place gird penalty for @entity44 who will subsequently start in a lowly 18th			1
it is the @entity69 's second penalty points of the year			0
ten more over the next year will result in a one - race ban			0
in action : @entity26 , who was disqualified from the @entity50 @entity11 , will start from fifth on sunday dreamy : @entity1 posted this picture after qualifying drivers are being forced to keep their weight down to an absolute minimum following the overhaul in regulations this season			2
before jetting to @entity50 , @entity81 told @entity82 that he will visit a sauna before each qualifying session , while @entity85 wrote in his column for this website that he has been forced to cut out all sugars from his diet			0
and his team - mate @entity1 summed up the mood after qualifying when he posted a picture staring at a container full of biscuits before writing ' if only … ' on a more serious note , @entity95 claimed during his commentary for @entity98 , that a driver , who he did n't wish to name , fainted at a pr event last week directly as a result of his enforced diet			1
next year the weight limit will be increased , but in light of such alarming stories , perhaps there should be a serious case to change the ruling this season			0
incredibly @entity27 was only 0.055seconds away from stopping @entity1 from clinching pole			2
mercedes have looked very strong all weekend – they were one second - a - lap quicker than the rest of the field in final practice			0
but to his and @entity64 's credit - albeit in damp conditions , @entity27 managed to split the duo during qualifying			1
even the four - time world champion appeared surprised by the miniscule margin separating he and his rival , giving @entity1 a playful shove in parc ferme after seeing their respective lap times			1
shake on it : @entity27 congratulates @entity1 after qualifying for the @entity12 @entity11 sherlock star @entity128 enjoyed somewhat of a paddock tour on saturday popping up in the @entity46 , @entity131 and @entity112 garages just minutes before qualifying			2
the @entity8 actor was a big hit with the drivers , too , sharing time with @entity136 and @entity85			0
former @entity137 and @entity139 star @entity138 was also seen in the @entity131 garage while @entity81 's fiancée @entity141 donned the @entity144 team 's colours as she watched her future husband qualify 10th after his gamble to take to the track on intermediate tyres backfired			0
centre of attention : @entity128 is interviewed outside the @entity131 garage and @entity141 cheers on @entity81 , who will start tomorrow 's race from 10th			0
