by @entity0 last updated at 1:43 pm on 20th december 2011 poor @entity1 : @entity2 gave a lethal dose of morphine on his first shift after struggling to understand labels patients are still at risk despite new @entity11 proposals on hospitals taking on staff without an adequate grasp of @entity15 , the medical regulator has warned			1
under the proposals overseas doctors will be able to register in the @entity18 without being tested on their language skills or medical competence			2
this is because the @entity11 directive says language testing can only take place after a doctor has had their qualifications accepted by the regulator			1
and even then language testing should only then take place if there are specific concerns about an individual doctor , the rules say			1
the @entity34 said today patient safety was still at risk and called for clarification of the detail in the directive			2
parts of the directive suggest regulators should only intervene and language test doctors when there are ' serious and concrete doubt about the professional ’s sufficient language knowledge '			1
but the @entity34 has called for blanket @entity1 language testing at the point of registration , not after a doctor has already been accepted , to ensure no one slips through the net			1
and it believes it is important to test the language skills of all doctors , not just when concerns have been raised about their performance			1
under current rules the @entity34 also can not test clinical competency of doctors coming from the @entity11 , even though it would like to do so			1
however , the regulator welcomed a clause in the directive for member states to inform each other when a doctor has faced sanctions that affect their registration			1
@entity71 , chief executive of the @entity34 said today : ' this proposed directive covers a number of important issues that affect the safety of patients			2
' we are pleased to see that it includes , for the first time , a requirement for regulators across @entity82 to tell each other proactively when action has been taken against a doctor ’s registration			2
' the proposed changes on language requirements will however raise serious concerns for patients			1
tragedy : dr @entity91 , whose father @entity92 was killed by @entity93 doctor @entity2 ' we will study the detail carefully but it remains our view that the final directive should provide greater safeguards for patients			1
' over the coming months we will continue work with the @entity100 , meps , other regulators , and @entity11 institutions to ensure that the final version of the directive focuses on protecting patients			1
' the @entity34 has been pushing for stronger language testing since the case of @entity92 , who died in @entity108 in 2008			1
he was killed by @entity93 doctor @entity2 who administered 10 times the normal dose of diamorphine			2
dr @entity2 admitted being exhausted after getting only a couple of hours sleep before starting his shift in the @entity18 , and said he was confused about the difference between drugs used here and in @entity93			0
his poor @entity1 meant he was refused work by the @entity119 in one part of the country but was later accepted in @entity122			2
the @entity124 son of mr @entity92 , @entity91 , said : ' if the @entity34 is going to be able to check the language of doctors at registration that is a major step forward for the safety of patients			0
' but what we push for next is for them all to undergo checks on their clinical competence			0
my father was killed by a doctor who was found to be clinically incompetent			0
' @entity138 , the secretary of state for health , announced new rules earlier this year to ensure hospitals language test @entity11 doctors in october , the @entity100 said it will give the @entity34 stronger powers to test the language skills of doctors where there are concerns about their ability to speak @entity1			1
however , this still falls short of the @entity34 ’s desire for blanket testing at point of registration			0
in addition , the @entity155 said it would introduce new powers so doctors can be vetted for their language skills at local level			0
@entity119 doctors are overseen by responsible officers , who make sure that they are appropriately trained and qualified for the role			0
in future , these officers will have a mandatory duty to check the @entity1 language skills of all foreign doctors before they can be employed by the @entity119 in @entity168			0
today ’s directive also proposes introducing a voluntary ' professional card ' - an electronic certificate which regulatory authorities could exchange securely over the internet			0
health secretary @entity138 said : ' for too long patients have been let down by lax @entity11 rules which have allowed doctors to operate in the @entity18 without the necessary safeguards			2
' that ’s why i am bringing in new rules on checking doctors ’ language skills and new powers to take action against doctors who ca n’t speak @entity1 properly			0
consultation : it had been hoped there would be rigorous new tests will ensure that @entity190 can speak sufficient @entity1 ( picture posed by models ) ' the @entity11 ’s plans for an early alert system and better sharing of information about the doctors that come to work in the @entity18 are steps in the right direction but we need to understand more of the detail behind them			1
' for example , we would need to be convinced that a common @entity82 professional card would bring tangible benefits and proper checking systems			0
' our overriding concern must be to protect patients from healthcare professionals who may not be properly skilled to do the job and we will do everything we can to work with the @entity11 to achieve this			2
' @entity214 , director of the @entity216 ’s @entity82 office , said : ' we have pushed hard for some of these changes , for example the introduction of an alert system so that countries can warn each other about dangerous health professionals			0
' these proposals mean that regulatory bodies will be allowed to check that healthcare workers can speak good @entity1			0
' however , the details of the @entity230 ’s proposals are still unclear and we will need to ensure the final wording allows the @entity119 to introduce checks which are fair and workable			0
' there are thought to be thousands of @entity82 doctors and nurses working in hospitals and surgeries who have never been given language checks			0
figures show that there are some 21,000 doctors on the @entity34 register who gained their qualifications in @entity11 countries			1
although the government has urged hospitals and primary care trusts to carry out their own checks on staff before employing them in the absence of a national test , many do not .			0

language testing can only take place after a doctor has had their qualifications accepted , says @entity11 directive
tests should only take place if there are specific concerns about an individual doctor
