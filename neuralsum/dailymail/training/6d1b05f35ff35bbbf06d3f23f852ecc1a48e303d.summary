by @entity1 reporter published : 09:15 est , 30 august 2013 updated : 09:19 est , 30 august 2013 spot the mistake : using old maps before a hospital was built , idiotic workers painted these yellow lines in @entity7 a council has admitted making a ' ridiculous ' mistake after it put double yellow lines across a busy t - junction			1
bungling workers painted a no - parking zone outside @entity14 in @entity7 because they were using maps from before it was built			1
baffled drivers say the situation is an ' embarrassment ' and a ' waste of cash ' because @entity22 will have to get them removed			1
' never in all my life have i seen anything so stupid - i just really could n't believe it , ' local man @entity23 said			0
' it looks like a child had done it it is that poor - maybe the painter was under the influence or suffering from the fumes given off the paint			0
' taxi driver @entity35 said he 's been driving around @entity14 since he was 17 and he 's never come across anything as peculiar			2
' the lines have gone right across the junction - i 've never seen anything like it before , ' he said			0
colleague @entity41 said : ' it 's ridiculous			0
you ca n't paint double yellow lines across the entrance of a hospital - what on earth were they thinking ? ' a @entity22 spokesman admitted it was an error but it could be weeks until they are removed			1
' prior to the hospital 's construction double yellow lines ran across where access to the hospital is now located			0
bizarre : drivers have called the mistake outside @entity14 ' the most stupid thing we 've ever seen ' ' during routine highway maintenance it seems a plan was used showing the markings as they were previously and unfortunately the external lining contractor mistakenly re-installed the old lines			1
' it was a genuine mistake and we apologise for any confusion it may have caused			0
' the markings will be rectified when the lining gang is next in the area - hopefully within the next few weeks			2

workers just followed old maps from before @entity14 hospital was built
@entity22 admit mistake and say it *'ll* be rectified within ' weeks '
