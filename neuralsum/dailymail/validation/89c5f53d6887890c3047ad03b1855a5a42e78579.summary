a damning report into one of the @entity3 ’s worst scandals is today expected to reveal up to ten missed opportunities to intervene to prevent poor care			0
the independent inquiry will be highly critical of how , despite a string of baby deaths , watchdogs gave an @entity3 trust the all clear only one month before the last general election			1
today ’s report is expected to conclude that between 2004 and 2011 there were a series of missed chances to step in at every level , from the hospital to the @entity17			1
tragedy : @entity19 was nine days old when he died from an infection that should have been treated with antibiotics at @entity22 , @entity23 up to 30 babies and mothers are thought to have died because of failings by midwives and doctors at @entity22 in @entity29			1
investigators are thought to have examined around 50 cases where poor maternity care has been alleged			0
the findings will again put @entity34 in the dock over its stewardship of the health service , revealing appalling care over years under the last government			0
the official report into care at the unit , run by @entity43 , will paint a damning picture of what went wrong , with echoes of the @entity48 hospital scandal , according to @entity50 sources			1
former @entity34 health secretary @entity51 was informed about concerns over maternity care at @entity54 in january 2010			1
up to 30 babies and mothers died at @entity22 because of failings by midwives and doctors , a damning report is expected to reveal locally , the alarm was first raised in 2008 when nine - day - old @entity19 died on a ward at @entity22			1
an inquest heard midwives and medical staff made ten serious errors that contributed to @entity19 ’s death , including a failure to detect and monitor an infection			1
his parents repeatedly asked if he should have antibiotics and complained he was wheezing and not feeding properly			1
he eventually died from blood poisoning			1
medical charts subsequently went missing and the coroner raised suspicions that they may have been deliberately destroyed			2
health officials tried to cover up their failure to investigate poor patient care , it is claimed			0
mr @entity51 , now @entity34 ’s shadow health secretary , has repeatedly denied being made aware of ‘ specific warnings ’ about the hospital or putting any pressure on the @entity82 to tone down criticism of the @entity3 ahead of the 2010 election			2
grief : @entity86 and @entity87 lost their baby son @entity19 in 2008 but @entity90 , conservative mp for @entity91 and @entity92 , said he was ‘ surprised and disappointed ’ that mr @entity51 had not been interviewed by the inquiry , chaired by dr @entity94 , a former @entity17 associate medical director who also served on an investigation into @entity98			1
‘ it ’s hard to understand why the inquiry has n’t listened to parents who wanted @entity51 to be questioned , ’ mr @entity90 said			2
‘ they should disclose the reasons why they decided not to call him			0
’ @entity19 ’s father @entity106 , who was appointed to the @entity82 in 2013 to try to prevent a repeat of such tragedies , is also understood to have protested			1
in an email to dr @entity94 , seen by the @entity111 , mr @entity19 wrote : ‘ i do want to put on record that i am very surprised and disappointed that the investigation has n’t interviewed @entity51			1
i have … raised with you on many occasions , the evidence from people who were working in the system at the time that there was a culture of “ no bad news ”			2
‘ i am sure that your investigation must have uncovered issues relating to some of the external , system and national policy issues that impacted on the way people were behaving at the time			0
’ victims ’ families reacted with anger when mr @entity51 tried to arrange a meeting ahead of today ’s findings			0
@entity135 , whose wife and newborn son died , said : ‘ none of us were interested			2
@entity51 has hidden under a stone for six years			0
when @entity34 said they were weaponising the @entity3 for the election , it made me want to vomit			0
’ a spokesman for mr @entity51 said he ‘ acted entirely properly ’ at all times in relation to @entity54			0
he had volunteered to campaigners the fact that information on maternity care at the trust had been included in an annexe to a wider briefing on issues that might be raised in a meeting with a local mp in 2010			2
a @entity34 spokesman said : ‘ the report will dismiss these political allegations and confirm that no @entity34 health secretary was briefed on @entity54			0
it will instead say that the terrible failings , which span this government and the last one , were very localised			0
’ an inquiry spokesman said it ‘ found no evidence that would have required an interview ’ of mr @entity51 .			0

up to 30 babies and mothers died at @entity22
concerns first raised in 2008 when @entity19 died of infection
baby should have been treated with antibiotics at hospital in @entity23
new inquiry will conclude that neglect contributed to even more deaths
