by @entity0 @entity1 took one final , forlorn look at the smouldering @entity3 behind him and held his head in his hands , his hopes of victory at sunday 's @entity8 — and who knows what else — ravaged by a fireball			1
it was during his first fast lap of qualifying that orange flames came pouring out of the back of his car			2
i ’m on fire , ’ he radioed to his @entity3 engineers			1
‘ ok @entity1 just stop the car where there is a fire marshal , ’ was their instruction only for the @entity23 to inform them : ‘ i ca n’t stop it ! ’ extinguish : @entity3 driver @entity1 pulls out of qualfying at the @entity30 @entity8 inferno : @entity1 's @entity3 caught fire as he was driving around the @entity33 in @entity34 @entity35 : @entity1 managed to drive around the track and make it to the pit lane before he jumped out of the car cloud : smoke billowed out of the engine as a fuel leak caused @entity1 's @entity3 to catch fire state : @entity46 's @entity3 was badly damaged by the fire as it spread around the rear end of the car @entity50 : @entity1 cuts a frustrated figure as he walks away from his smoking car pacesetter : @entity1 's @entity3 team - mate @entity54 qualified on pole at the @entity33 1			1
@entity54 ( @entity3 ) 2			1
@entity56 ( @entity57 ) 3			2
@entity58 ( @entity59 ) 4			2
@entity60 ( @entity57 ) 5			2
@entity61 ( @entity62 ) 6			2
@entity63 ( @entity59 ) 7			2
@entity64 ( @entity65 ) 8			0
@entity66 ( @entity67 ) 9			0
@entity68 ( @entity69 ) 10			0
@entity70 ( @entity65 ) 21			0
@entity1 ( @entity3 ) marshals sprayed their fire extinguishers at the blaze , yet smoke continued to leak out for several minutes longer			1
the fire meant he did not record a time and he will start from the pit lane — a disappointment compounded by his @entity3 team - mate @entity54 taking a pole position as comfortably as any of his six this season			1
it was impossible to feel anything but sympathy for @entity1 , who is enduring a horrible run of bad luck			1
four times mechanical problems have hindered him in the first 11 rounds of the championship			0
@entity54 , his only rival for the title , has suffered two glitches ( one of which , in @entity93 , he managed successfully whereas @entity1 retired with the same over-heating brake complaint )			1
‘ there ’s a lot going through my mind , but i just have to try to turn it into positives , ’ said @entity1 , who trails his team - mate by 14 points			1
looking on : @entity1 stares at his smoking mercedes as engineers try and extinguish the fire flames : @entity1 drives around a corner of the @entity33 with his engine on fire during @entity109 frustration : @entity1 has now gone six race without a pole position after his withdrawal in @entity34 before going he provided a few considered thoughts on the incident			1
‘ i bailed out of that timed lap and something happened to my brakes so i had to engage some settings to correct it and then the engine just died , ’ he said			0
‘ i was on the pit - lane entry so hoped i could get it back to the pits and they could fix it , but i looked in my rear mirrors and it was on fire			1
‘ i hoped to get it to the garage			0
maybe they could have done something but i tried to stop and the brakes were n’t working			0
it is all pretty bad			0
i honestly do n’t know what i can do tomorrow			0
i will struggle to get in the top five or 10			0
‘ i ’ll probably leave here more than 20 points behind @entity54 but there are still races to go			1
i will try my best			0
’ contrasting fortunes : @entity54 races past @entity1 with the @entity23 's mercedes on fire in the pit lane centre of attention : @entity54 claimed his third consecutive pole ahead of @entity56 and @entity58 last week he produced a dazzling remedial drive from 20th on the grid to finish third at @entity149			1
but this twisty track presents so few overtaking chances that he will have to drive even more outstandingly to find a way to the podium			0
so if @entity54 has no problems , he is clear favourite to win			1
@entity57 ’s @entity56 , who was second yesterday , and @entity59 ’ @entity58 , who was third quickest , are surely left to fight it out with the best of the rest			0
@entity54 earned his pole by dealing with the tricky rain that had just started to fall at the first corner during the final shootout for pole			2
he ran wide , but had cut his speed sufficiently to steer himself back on to the track			0
@entity165 , following behind , was less adroit , thudding his @entity65 into the tyre wall to condemn him to start from the pit lane			2
the @entity169 ’s team - mate @entity64 was seventh fastest , seven places higher than he started the race in 2006 — his first victory			1
it rained that afternoon , mixing up the usual order			0
rain is again forecast for sunday			2
@entity176 endured another awful afternoon			0
he was pipped by his possible @entity62 replacement , @entity179 ’s @entity178 , after his team embarrassingly told him to sit in the garage rather than put in another lap. by that point , @entity1 was already out of his car , on the way to a blue @entity3 4x4 and back to the hotel			1
as he walked out he fiddled with the rosary beads hanging around his neck			0
helpless : @entity1 can only lean over his mercedes as he watches race stewards attempt to put out the fire facing away : @entity1 looks into the distance as his @entity3 continues to billow smoke in the background smash : @entity165 's @entity65 is put on the back of a tow truck following his big crash in qualifying poor : @entity62 's @entity176 was knocked out of qualifying in @entity34 for the second week in a row			1

@entity3 driver @entity1 radioed to his team ' guys . i *'m* on fire '
@entity1 trails his @entity3 team - mate @entity54 by 14 points
@entity213 *sportsman* @entity1 will ' try his best ' to catch @entity54
@entity1 will start sunday 's @entity30 @entity8 in 21st spot
