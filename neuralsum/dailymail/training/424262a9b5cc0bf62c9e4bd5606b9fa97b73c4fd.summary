by @entity0 one stunned @entity3 customer in @entity4 was served up her morning joe with the mark of the devil written out in caramel syrup on sunday			1
while many of the coffee mega-chain 's detractors who believe it to be the antithesis of authentic coffee may not be surprised , @entity10 teacher @entity9 was most definitely upset			1
so annoyed was @entity9 to be handed two drinks with a satanic pentagram and 666 etched atop on the @entity19 , that she took to @entity20 to air her fury			1
satanic outrage : these are the two coffees handed to @entity9 which caused her to express her fury on @entity20 to @entity3 ' i unfortunately ca n't give the young man ’s name who served it , because i was so appalled that i could not bring myself to look at him , ' @entity9 wrote in her post according to the @entity31			1
' i am in no way judging his beliefs or dis - meriting his beautiful artwork , i am however judging his lack of professionalism and respect for others			0
not impressed : @entity9 received a full and unreserved apology from @entity3 for the satanic coffees served up to her by a barista ' i am a teacher in the public school system and if i were to present a child of atheist or pagan believers with a @entity47 art project i could be sued in a heartbeat			1
' i am of catholic faith and would love to share in my beliefs daily			0
fortunately i have enough common sense to present myself with professionalism and follow an ethics code			0
' perhaps that could be suggested to that particular location			0

' @entity57 was asked if the incident would change @entity3 ’ policy on foam art. ' i do n’t know ; i guess it could , ' he replied			2
