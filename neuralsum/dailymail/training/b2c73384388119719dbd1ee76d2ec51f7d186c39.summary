@entity0 is an interviewer , programme - maker and football expert for @entity3 by @entity0 starting at the top of the formation , getting the best out of @entity9 ’s best player , @entity8 , could be a critical part of a successful tournament			1
@entity8 is a centre - forward who thrives in that position and i do n’t see why there is even a debate on this			1
he should be in that no 9 role , up front and centre , and allowed to play to his strengths			0
the keeper and back four effectively select themselves , not least because the centre - half pairing of @entity26 and @entity27 have become something like established , with a decent understanding			0
so @entity37 and @entity39 should make up the two - man shield that adds protection to the back four			1
that leaves a line of three for a trio of young , swashbuckling , attack - minded players , and if fit and available then , right to left , i ’d choose @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53			1
flyer : @entity52 power : @entity51 saints alive : @entity57 fingers crossed : @entity53 would get the nod over @entity57 if he recovers from injury in time they ’re all mobile and would interchange positions			1
if the @entity64 does n’t make it , then @entity57 comes in			0
@entity66 has had too many injuries for me to start although he could play himself into a starting place			2
@entity57 can fit into that three , as can @entity70 , who i ’d use as a cameo impact sub initially			0
@entity72 offers cover in the shield			0
@entity75 is @entity9 ’s ‘ secret weapon ’ : many opponents wo n’t know him well , and he offers excellence from the penalty spot			2
he ’s living the dream , delighted to be there — and good luck to him			0
secret weapon : not many countries will know about @entity75 who is living the dream with @entity9			2

former @entity9 *captain* @entity0 selects his @entity87 starting @entity88
@entity8 is @entity9 's best player and must start up front
@entity38 's @entity37 and @entity39 to provide a shield
@entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53 , if fit , provide pace in attack
