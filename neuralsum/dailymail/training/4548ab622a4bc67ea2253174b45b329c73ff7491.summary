by @entity0 published : 18:06 est , 26 may 2013 updated : 18:16 est , 26 may 2013 it seems that the impossible has occurred : the nation 's most congested city has become a model for traffic control			1
yes , gridlock still prevails and drivers ' blood pressure still spikes as @entity10 's traffic arteries seize up during every morning and afternoon rush hour			1
yet , with the flip of a switch earlier this year , @entity10 became a worldwide leader by synchronizing all of its nearly 4,400 stoplights , making it the world 's first major city to do so			1
synched up : all of @entity10 ' 4,400 stop lights are now synched up the result ? well , it can still be hell to cross the @entity10 by car			1
synchronization has allowed @entity10 to boast of real improvements on paper , however , the average driver wo n't always be able to discern the difference of a project that took nearly 30 years to complete			1
" to be honest with you , i have n't felt it , yet , " said @entity30 , who has been driving a cab across @entity10 's mean streets for 20 years			1
" late at night , maybe , yes , " @entity30 said as he sat outside his cab on a street in @entity37 recently , waiting for a fare			2
" but it was never really bad then anyway			0
during the day it was bad			0
and it 's still bad			0
" the way synchronization works is simple enough : with all the signals synchronized , if you drive down a street at the posted speed limit you should be able to make every green light - from one end of this sprawling city of 469 square miles to the other			1
of course there are any number of obstacles that can prevent that			0
congestion : transportation engineer associate @entity57 works at the @entity10 @entity59 's @entity58 and @entity60 on a recent mid-afternoon test drive down eight miles of @entity63 , for example , i was cut off by a bus , stuck behind more than one right - turner waiting for pedestrians to cross the intersecting street and at one point had my lane blocked by a delivery truck			1
approaching the world famous @entity72 - where prehistoric dinosaurs once got stuck in muck , not traffic - so many people were waiting to turn left into a parking lot that the street became gridlocked for more than two blocks			1
the numerous synchronized green lights did n't wait for me			2
but why would they ? with the posted speed limit 35 mph , i was only averaging 15			1
still , once the @entity84 , the high - rise apartments , the headquarters of porn publisher @entity87 and the various other @entity63 landmarks were in the rear - view mirror , the pace did pick up			0
so much so that 11 green lights in a row suddenly materialized			0
that string ended on the edge of downtown , however , when @entity95 simply became clogged with too many cars			0
it was a non-rush hour jam that demonstrated that , good as synchronization may be , it is n't a magic , traffic - breaking bullet			0
city of angels - and gridlock : @entity10 freeways are amongst the most congested in the world as they stated in a recent report praising the benefits of synchronized signals , " no traffic signal system is capable of ` fixing traffic			1
' " if more motor vehicles show up in the years ahead ( and there are already more than 7.1 million of them registered in @entity116 , a number greater than that of most states ) , then officials say @entity10 traffic jams will probably get worse			2
that 's why , said @entity123 , an engineering associate with the @entity102 , planners are continuing to push people to ride bicycles , take commuter rail lines and other public transportation and move close enough to work that they can walk there			0
the city has added three light rail lines in the last seven years and has more planned			2
officials also recently approved plans to allow high - rise apartment and condominium buildings along a corridor in @entity137 where a subway connecting the city 's @entity139 to downtown is supposed to go			2
in the meantime , @entity123 says , the synchronized signal program is putting up some pretty impressive numbers , even if the average driver is n't noticing them			0
it has reduced the drive time on several major @entity10 corridors , for example , by about 12 percent			1
in driver - speak , that means the trip across town that used to take you an hour has been reduced to about 53 minutes			0
and that 's nothing to shrug at , says @entity157 , a senior fellow with the @entity159 's metropolitan policy program , which studies among other things the impact of traffic on the quality of life in metropolitan areas			0
several other traffic - clogged cities are looking into instituting similar programs and @entity169 already synchronizes some of its stoplights , said @entity157 , who works in @entity171 , the ninth - worst traffic - clogged city in the country			2
" if you can get a 12 percent reduction on , say , the @entity177 , that would be phenomenal , " he said .			0

@entity10 became a worldwide leader by synchronizing all of its nearly 4,400 stoplights , making it the world 's first major city to do so .
with all the signals synchronized , if you drive down a street at the posted speed limit you should be able to make every green light - from one end of this sprawling city of 469 square miles to the other .
the project took an *astonishing* 30 years to complete
