by @entity0 published : 07:57 est , 26 august 2013 updated : 07:59 est , 26 august 2013 teenage drivers who listen to rock or rap music are more likely to drive badly or be involved in a crash , a study found			1
young motorists made a greater number of errors and miscalculations while driving with their aggressive , fast - paced and loud music on , according to research from @entity12 in @entity13			1
but when soothing tunes were played motoring behaviour actually improved , the survey discovered			0
men in particular made more frequent and serious mistakes listening to their favourite tunes than their less aggressive , female counterparts , the researchers noted			1
risk : teens who listen to loud , aggressive music while behind the wheel are more likely to be involved in a crash or drive badly , a study found ( file photo ) the @entity31 study evaluated 85 young novice drivers accompanied by a researcher / driving instructor			1
each driver took six challenging 40 - minute trips ; two with music from their own playlists ; two with background music designed to increase driver safety ( easy listening , soft rock , light jazz ) , and two additional trips without any music			0
the study was conducted by @entity31 director of music @entity46 and researcher @entity47 to assess distraction by measuring driver deficiencies ( miscalculation , inaccuracy , aggressiveness , and violations ) as well as decreased vehicle performance			0
when the teen drivers listened to their preferred music , virtually all ( 98 percent ) demonstrated an average of three deficient driving behaviors in at least one of the trips			2
dangers : young men are particularly susceptible to seeing their driving standards deteriorate if they listen to their preferred music			1
( picture posed by model ) nearly a third of those ( 32 percent ) required a a sudden verbal warning or command for action , and 20 percent needed an assisted steering or braking maneuver to prevent an imminent accident			0
these errors included speeding , tailgating , careless lane switching , passing vehicles and one - handed driving			0
without listening to any music , 92 percent made errors			2
however , when driving with an alternative music background designed by @entity80 and @entity13 music composer @entity81 , deficient driving behaviors decreased by 20 percent			2
' most drivers worldwide prefer to listen to music in a car and those between ages 16 to 30 choose driving to pop , rock , dance , hip - hop and rap , ' @entity80 explains			2
' young drivers also tend to play this highly energetic , fast - paced music very loudly - approximately 120 to 130 decibels			0
' ' drivers in general are not aware that as they get drawn - in by a song , they move from an extra-personal space involving driving tasks , to a more personal space of active music listening			1
' the @entity100 funded the study which will be published in the october issue of @entity103 .			0

young men are particularly prone to errors when listening to preferred music
98 per cent of drivers made mistakes while listening to their favourite tunes
soothing music reduced bad driving by 20 *%* , @entity13 study found
drivers ' get drawn - in by a song ' , according to @entity12 survey
