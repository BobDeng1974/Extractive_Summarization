@entity0 shed tears of joy when he finally usurped @entity3 as the @entity5 winner for 2013			1
he was also officially crowned the world ’s best player , above @entity3 , for 2014			1
but here ’s the bad news , @entity0			0
despite the gongs and the widely - held opinion that @entity0 was superior to his great rival over the past two years , @entity3 still contributed more valuable goals to his club and country in 2013 and 2014			1
that is the view of the number - crunchers at @entity18 , who have calculated the worth of each player 's goals , based on how crucial the goal was to the match result ( and the subsequent gains from that result ) , as well as the importance of the game			2
@entity3 ( left ) and @entity0 ( right ) in action during last sunday 's @entity31 duel @entity3 's @entity32 beat @entity0 's @entity33 2 - 1 at the @entity34 , with the @entity36 scoring the explanations of the precise formulas used and the value of certain matches in relation to others are both long and complicated , so to read them in full click here			1
@entity46 ’s calculator also seems to be broken , so again to see the full numbers , let the @entity49 ’s boffins guide you through			0
be warned , though : the introduction contains a reference to ' the @entity53 for soccer ' , so it ’s not for the faint - hearted			0
but the key facts are these			0
@entity3 ’s ( still fantastic ) total of 86 goals over the period does not compare with @entity0 's superhuman 105			2
@entity0 shed tears of joy when he won the @entity5 over @entity3 in 2013 the @entity33 hero stripped off to celebrate his goal in the @entity65 final last season but @entity0 's penalty against @entity68 was virtually worthless , according to @entity18 each of @entity0 ’s 105 goals , however , were worth an average of 0.40 points to his team in relation to the most likely result of the match before the goal was scored			1
by contrast , @entity3 ’s 86 goals were worth an average of 0.47 points each			0
and if that sounds like gobbledegook , essentially this can be explained in simple terms : a goal in a match where the score is tied 1 - 1 in the final minutes yields more points ( or aggregate value in cup ties ) to his team than a goal scored in a match where the player 's team is already winning 3 - 1			0
the economist uses @entity0 ’s three goals in the semi-final and final of last year ’s @entity65 as an example to show their relative lack of value			2
in the second leg of the semi-final against @entity106 , @entity0 scored when @entity33 led 3 - 0 and 4 - 0 on aggregate			1
and in the final against @entity68 , his penalty in extra-time when @entity33 were 3 - 1 ahead had a virtually negligible value			2
@entity3 has rediscovered his best form this season after losing out to @entity0 since 2013 @entity3 is on international duty with @entity115 and is pictured here training in @entity116 @entity3 was all smiles here at the 2013 awards nominations but @entity0 walked off with the prize the importance of @entity3 's goals means he should have claimed the big prize six times , says @entity18 @entity3 , however , scored a winning goal in the final 20 minutes of a match on five different occasions in 2013 and 2014 , which hands him the advantage over @entity0			1
the economist suggests that the only reason that the @entity115 star has not claimed six @entity131 in a row is ‘ @entity3 fatigue ’			0
if you 've got a spare week or so , a working abacus and @entity136 available for a chat , you could try to prove them wrong …			0

@entity0 has won the last two world player of the year awards
@entity3 had won previous four but @entity0 beat his long - time rival
@entity33 superstar is widely *acknowledged* to have *deserved* gongs
but @entity18 argues that @entity3 is still the superior player
