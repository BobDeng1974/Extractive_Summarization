if you 're the sort of gentleman who holds the door open for a lady – or the sort of woman who expects him to – then be warned			0
such acts of chivalry may actually be ' benevolent sexism ' in disguise , according to researchers			1
experts say this type of sexism is harder to spot than the ' hostile sexism ' we are more familiar with – because it often masquerades as gallantry			1
it is typified by paternal and protective behaviour , from encouraging smiles to holding doors open			0
sexist ? @entity24 researchers carried out a study into types of sexism in men			1
they say there are two types of sexists , identifiable by their smile ( stock image shown ) ' hostile sexist men ' were less approachable and less friendly while those who displayed ' benevolent sexism ' were nicer and smiled more @entity37 researchers argue that while women may enjoy being showered with attention , benevolent sexism is ' insidious ' and men who are guilty of it see women as incompetent beings who require their ' cherished protection '			1
professor @entity46 , of @entity47 in @entity24 , said : ' benevolent sexism is like a wolf in sheep 's clothing that perpetuates support for gender inequality among women			1
' these supposed gestures of good faith may entice women to accept the status quo in society because sexism literally looks welcoming , appealing and harmless			2
' working with a male colleague , professor @entity46 paired 27 men with women they had never met before and gave them a quiz game to play and time to chat afterwards			2
ladies should behave like men if they want to work in male - dominated industries , according to a controversial study			2
research by professor @entity70 , a psychologist at @entity71 , suggests recruiters prefer more masculine traits to those commonly associated with women			0
she asked women to apply for leadership roles in male - dominated industries such as engineering in front of a panel of volunteers asked to evaluate the candidates ' suitability			0
some of the women were asked to emphasise ' masculine - like ' traits such as assertiveness , independence and raw ambition			0
others were asked to display more ' feminine traits ' - warmth , supportiveness and a nurturing nature			0
the panel , irrespective of the gender of those sitting on it , decided that leadership required more dominant and assertive traits to be shown during the interview process			0
the men , who were aged 18 to 22 , also filled in a survey designed to detect sexist attitudes			2
examples of hostile sexism included agreeing that women tend to exaggerate problems at work , while someone who is benevolently sexist will believe women should be rescued before men from a sinking ship			1
they found men whose answers led to them being classed as benevolently sexist smiled more while playing the quiz game and chatting			1
they were more patient while waiting for their female partners to answer the trivia questions and warmer , friendlier and chattier than those who were hostile sexists			2
writing in the journal @entity124 , the researchers said that while such behaviour may be well - intentioned , this does n't mean it is n't harmful			0
men who are guilty of benevolent sexism see women as ' warm and pure , yet helpless and incompetent beings '			1
study co-author @entity131 said : ' benevolent sexist men hold women in high regard and are willing to sacrifice themselves to save and protect women			1
however , benevolent sexist men perceive women as the weaker gender at the same time			1
thousands marched on 8 march 2015 for @entity139			0
more than 1,000 women and men were marching for gender equality in @entity143 today - pictured here - as millions of people across the world rallied to demand change ' unless sexism is understood as having both hostile and benevolent properties , the insidious nature of benevolent sexism will continue to be one of the driving forces behind gender inequality in our society			1
' but critics have argued that there is nothing wrong with men trying to protect women as they are usually the physically stronger sex			0
@entity163 , a writer on social policy , said : ' there are times when it is very important for women to be protected			0
we should accept this and not seek to stamp out what is likely a good instinct on the whole			0
