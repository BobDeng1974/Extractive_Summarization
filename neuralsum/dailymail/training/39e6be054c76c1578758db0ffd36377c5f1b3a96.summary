@entity1 may like to boast of its liberal ideals but it is still a man 's world in many ways , a new study has shown			0
not only are women dramatically under - represented on screen and behind the scenes , but even the most successful female stars are paid significantly less than men			2
last year , of the 10 biggest payments to actors per film , not one went to a woman , according to research cited by the @entity16 campaign group @entity15			1
@entity17 was the top earning actress last year after taking home a pay packet of $ 33 million			1
that figure was dwarfed however by the highest - earning man – @entity22 – who earned $ 75 million quoting analysis by the @entity25 of the 2013 earnings of @entity1 ’s best paid 10 male and 10 female stars , the study found that while @entity17 was the top - earning actress , she lagged behind all but two of the men in the list			1
and while , at $ 33 million , her pay packet was enormous , it was dwarfed by the highest - earning man – @entity22 – who earned $ 75 million			1
at the same time , the study found that age appeared to be far more of a dominant factor in women ’s earning potential			2
like @entity39 , star of the @entity41 films , most of the men are at least in their 40s , with two – @entity45 and @entity46 – in their 50s and @entity49 aged 61			2
in contrast , most of the women are in their 20s and 30s while the oldest , @entity54 , is just 49			1
the gender inequality continues on - screen , said the report			0
at aged 23 , @entity58 ( pictured in @entity59 ) was the youngest female on the list , also coming just behind @entity17 earning $ 26 million			2
@entity61 ( right ) came second behind @entity39 on the men 's list earning $ 60 million last year @entity64 was the third highest @entity1 earner in 2013 , according to the @entity25 , after earning $ 55m @entity66 , 23 ( left ) , earned $ 21.5 million in 2013 , while @entity67 bucked the trend of younger actresses making the most money			1
the 45 - year - old earned $ 20 million only six per cent of the top 100 films made in 2012 cast the sexes in roughly equal numbers			1
women accounted for only 29 percent of the speaking roles and all too often , they were primarily there to look decorative - roughly a third involved wearing sexually revealing clothes or being partially naked			0
indeed , female characters were four times more likely to wear sexually revealing clothes or have to strip off than men			0
the survey also noted a disturbing rise in younger women actors being asked to shed their clothes on screen – the percentage of teenage girls depicted with some nudity has increased a third since 2007			0
@entity22 , 48 - $ 75 million @entity61 , 33 - $ 60 million @entity64 , 45 - $ 55 million @entity92 , 42 - $ 51 million @entity93 , 41 - $ 46 million @entity94 , 39 - $ 38 million @entity95 , 47 - $ 36.5 million @entity45 , 51 - $ 35 million @entity46 , 59 - $ 33 million @entity49 , 61 - $ 31.5 million ( source : @entity25 ) @entity17 , 38 - $ 33 million @entity58 , 23 - $ 26 million @entity66 , 23 - $ 21.5 million @entity67 , 45 - $ 20 million @entity97 , 25 - $ 16 million @entity98 , 38 - $ 15 million @entity54 , 49 - $ 14 million @entity99 , 32 – $ 14 million @entity100 , 30 - $ 11 million @entity101 , 46 - $ 11 million ( source : @entity25 ) behind the camera , the gender inequality is getting even worse			1
of last year ’s 250 top - grossing films , women accounted for 16 percent of directors and other senior roles			2
the study also looked at the representation of ethnic minorities and found they , too , are woefully under - represented			0
a majority of films had casts where fewer than one in 10 of the actors were black			0
‘ we know that what we see on screen is in direct proportion to who ’s calling the shots , ’ said prof @entity117 , who led the study			0
‘ we were able to look across 500 films and see who was the director … and what we have is a representational road block			0

of the 10 - biggest payments to actors per film , not one went to a woman
@entity17 earned $ *33m* , while @entity22 earned $ *75m*
most of the top earning males were in 40s - 50s
women by contrast were in their 20s - 30s
