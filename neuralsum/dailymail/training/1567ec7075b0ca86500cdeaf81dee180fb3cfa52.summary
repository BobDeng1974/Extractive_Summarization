by @entity0 thousands of women migrant domestic workers in @entity3 are being severely exploited and sexually abused in ' utterly miserable conditions ' , according to a new report by an international human rights group			1
the 77 - page @entity8 report titled ' my sleep is my break : exploitation of domestic workers in @entity3 ' has uncovered the appalling conditions women - primarily from the @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity20 - face on a daily basis			1
in the report , women are said to be lured to @entity3 on the basis of false promises over salaries and working conditions - only to be made to work extreme hours and seven - day weeks			1
appalling conditions : a migrant worker sitting on a bunk bed in his accommodation in @entity3 , the host country of the soccer @entity33 in 2022 a computer image of the ' @entity37 ' stadium , for the @entity33 2022 , to be built in @entity38 , @entity3 some women also described how they were also subjected to sexual and physical violence			1
the report , which draws upon interviews with 52 female domestic workers , revealed that in some cases women in @entity3 are being made to work up to 100 hours per week , with no days off			1
under @entity3 law there are no limits on working hours for domestic workers and no requirement to allow them a day off , and domestic workers are unable to lodge complaints with @entity3 ’s @entity53 - a situation which @entity8 is calling on the @entity3 authorities to remedy urgently			1
@entity3 ’s estimated 84,000 women migrant domestic workers are subject to the country ’s highly restrictive sponsorship system - known as the kafala system - which prevents migrant workers from leaving their job or the country without their employer ’s permission			1
as with male construction industry workers , the women routinely have their passports withheld by their employers , and in some cases employers also confiscate their mobile phones			2
while some women find good jobs and are treated well , those facing abuse are left with little choice but to “ run away ” , putting them at risk of being arrested , detained and deported on charges of ' absconding '			2

the human rights organisation @entity8 has found an ' alarming level of exploitation up to forced labor ' in @entity3 , the host country of the soccer @entity33 in 2022 a computer image of the ' @entity37 ' stadium , for the @entity33 2022 , to be built in @entity38 , @entity3 - which will be built by migrant workers , many of whom are complaining of appalling working conditions @entity8 's global issues director @entity92 said construction work in preparation for the @entity96 has shone a spotlight on the plight of migrant workers in @entity3			1
' the complete absence of protections for domestic workers ’ labour rights , and the fact that they are isolated in employers ’ homes , leaves them exposed to abuse to an even greater extent , ' she said			2
' migrant domestic workers are victims of a discriminatory system that denies them basic protections and leaves them open to exploitation and abuse , including forced labour and human trafficking			2
' she said many women spoke about being terribly deceived , and then trapped and at the mercy of their abusive employers			2
poor conditions at the @entity122 workers accommodation camp in the @entity123 of @entity38 , @entity3 , where the @entity96 will be held a migrant worker from @entity126 , in @entity3 , who suffered after a horrendous workplace accident in june 2011 that left him permanently disabled , he lived in @entity3 without pay while struggling to get compensation for his injury through the @entity3 court system an @entity18 woman being held at the deportation centre after fleeing from sustained physical abuse , showed @entity8 researchers a deep scar on her chest where her female employer had branded her with a hot iron			1
she told researchers she ’d been forced to work seven days a week , was not paid for months and was banned from leaving the house			1
“ women who find themselves in abusive households face utterly miserable conditions			1
they have few options - if they choose to simply to get out of the house , they will be branded " runaways " and are likely to end up being detained and deported , ' ms @entity92 said			0
' promises by the government to protect domestic workers ’ labour rights have so far not amounted to anything			0
' @entity8 researchers were told by women workers they were slapped , pulled by the hair , poked in the eyes , and kicked down the stairs by their employers			1
three women also reported that they had been raped			0
a computer image of the ' @entity161 ' stadium , designed by @entity164 architect company @entity162 & partner , for the @entity33 2022 , to be built in @entity38 , @entity3 in one horrific case , a domestic worker broke both her legs and fractured her spine when she fell from a window as she tried to escape a rape attack by her employer			1
her attacker then proceeded to sexually assault her as she lay on the ground , injured and unable to move , and only afterwards did he call an ambulance			0
when researchers interviewed her six months after the attack , she was still using a wheelchair			0
despite her appalling injuries , @entity3 ’s public prosecutor dismissed the case due to “ lack of evidence ” and she returned to the @entity17 last year			2
her employer has never been held accountable			0
women who have been physically or sexually abused face major obstacles to getting justice , with those who report sexual abuse also risking being charged with sexual relations outside of marriage - a ' crime ' in @entity3 normally punished with a year in jail and deportation			1
a computer image of the ' @entity197 ' stadium , designed by @entity164 architect company @entity162 & partner , for the @entity33 2022 , to be built in @entity38 , @entity3 @entity200 , from the @entity17 , told @entity8 that she was promised us $ 400 per month by a recruitment agency before she took up her job , but when she arrived in @entity3 she only received $ 247			1
' when i complained , the madam [ employer ] … told me “ you do n’t deserve it " , ' @entity200 , whose name has been disguised to protect her identity , explained			0
' i had to start work at 4am			0
i had to start at exactly that time			0
i would get about three to four hours ’ sleep			0
i would be constantly washing or ironing clothes and if the clothes were not clean enough i would have to wash and iron them again			0
' my hands split and bled because of the work ... i would run so hard that i would fall , and i lost feeling in my feet			0
i was n’t even allowed to go to toilet while i was working			0
' after two months of excessive hours and constant verbal abuse from her employer , @entity200 said she contacted the employment agent whose only interest appeared to be in ensuring that she worked for at least three months with her employer			0
' “ i called the recruitment agent and they would not help me			0
i think that this family has a history of problems - i heard that no - one has ever finished a contract with them , ' she said			0
