by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 is unlikely to get carried away by the fact that @entity4 touched down in @entity5 with the @entity6 in their possession			1
the @entity8 is experienced enough to know that victories like the one over @entity10 in the final in @entity12 might score a few points with the supporters but are worth very little else			1
there are far bigger tests to come			2
however , the manager he defeated at the @entity19 believes the new @entity4 boss might still be in for a rude awakening when the new @entity23 season starts a week on saturday			1
@entity28 has won titles at all three clubs in @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43			1
but @entity27 believes he will have a battle on his hands to add the @entity23 to that list			1
‘ i think he ’ll find the competition in this league will be different to any other league that he ’s worked in , ’ said the @entity10 boss			1
‘ in a lot of the other leagues , there are one or two teams and those are the teams that are expected to win			2
silver lining : @entity58 and @entity25 celebrate with the @entity59 @entity36 ( sept , 1991 ) the @entity8 powerhouses had won only one of the previous six league titles but @entity28 , in his first managerial post , went on to win a hat - trick of titles , a @entity67 trophy and a @entity68			1
@entity34 ( july , 1997 ) taking over from @entity69 , @entity28 won two back - to - back league titles and a @entity71			1
@entity72 ( july , 2005 ) @entity72 had established a reputation as a solid , mid-table club			2
@entity28 mounted a title challenge in his first season and after an 11th - placed blip in 2007 - 08 , won their first title in 28 years			1
‘ this is a league where the top team plays the bottom team and on any given day you can lose			0
‘ i think the competition will probably take him by ( surprise ) , and that ’s from foreign managers i have spoken to over the years			0
' i ’ve worked closely with foreign players , and that real physical competitive nature will be different to anywhere else he ’s worked before			0
’ @entity10 certainly did their best to emphasise the point in @entity12			1
@entity95 put them ahead from the penalty spot and last season ’s runners - up could have been more goals to the good before @entity4 hit back to win 3 - 1 with second - half strikes from @entity25 , @entity102 and @entity103			2
it means @entity28 won all five games on tour , albeit beating @entity107 on penalties			2
when @entity27 ’ comments were put to the @entity4 boss , he responded with the smile of a man who knows what to expect			1
all together : @entity102 is mobbed by his teammates after his goal @entity116 wants reinforcements touching down : @entity2 arrives back in @entity118 after winning in @entity119 ‘ that ’s why i ’m here , ’ said @entity28			1
‘ ok maybe he is right because i have to experience that , but i was also in @entity41 and in my first year i won three titles			2
in @entity42 i won two titles			0
if i win one here , we will all be happy			0
’ asked the value of winning the tournament , he replied : ‘ nothing			0
it ’s nice for the fans in the @entity119 — also at home — that we beat @entity10			1
it ’s not our favourite opponent , i think , for @entity4 fans			2
we ’ve given a lot of pleasure to these fans and that ’s very important			0
‘ of course it is better to win in pre-season than to lose			0
but the most important game is @entity143 at home in the first game , that ’s the one we have to win			0
’ as well as managing two top clubs in close proximity to one another , @entity28 and @entity27 also work under @entity119 owners			1
although the @entity150 spoke of his respect for his new rival and his belief that @entity4 will be title challengers again this season , he still believes @entity28 ’s predecessor @entity156 was let down by the @entity157 during his ill - fated season in charge at @entity160			1
‘ i think there were a lot of things at @entity4 that were not seen by many , ’ said @entity27			1
‘ @entity156 had to go in and where i felt for him is that he thought he was getting time			0
he signed a long - term deal and thought he had that longevity			0
you have to win games and hopefully then you get the chance			0
that ’s where i ’m very fortunate here			0
i ’ve got brilliant owners			0
i ’ve been clear in terms of how i ’ve wanted to work and i ’ve been able to work			0
’ warning : @entity27 says @entity2 will find managing @entity4 tough asked if @entity4 can emulate @entity10 by recovering from a seventh - place finish to challenge for the title again , @entity27 said : ‘ i think it will be a totally different mindset			1
domestically , for the last 20 years they ’ve been champions 13 times			0
so they already have something in place			0
when i came to @entity10 , we were eighth at the time and the club was nearly going out of business , so it ’s totally different			2
‘ the @entity4 players will be disappointed with where they finished last year , of course			2
with the quality they have , they will want to push on			0

@entity4 beat @entity10 in the final of the @entity59 in @entity119
@entity27 thinks @entity28 will find the strength of the @entity23 different to anything he has experienced
@entity28 believes he has the experience to help @entity4
