but even the most ostentatious @entity5 might find the gold bodice and body paint get - up that appeared at @entity8 last night a touch over the top			0
the brainchild of @entity14 designer duo , @entity15 , the odd creation was one of the most outrageous looks from the fashion event so far			1
it was n't the only bizarre outfit to appear on the catwalk either , with everything from lilac lace face masks to ammonite - inspired collars cropping up on the runway			0
going for gold : @entity15 's bling bodice was one of @entity30 's oddest looks so far bizarre : the @entity14 duo also sent this extremely odd look down the catwalk during their @entity5 show @entity15 came up trumps with another strange look , which included a lilac and blue lace face - covering hat , teamed with yet another bodice and a spangled all in one			1
but although the @entity14 pair led the brash pack , they had plenty of competition from homegrown designers			1
designer @entity49 lived up to her name , taking @entity51 as her inspiration and sending a succession of eccentric sheer monochrome jumpsuits down the runway			1
other male models to suffer from the creative whims of local designers included the chaps at @entity60 , who sent her long - suffering runway stars down the catwalk in odd modern caveman type creations , and those at @entity65 , who wore fur coats with what looked like a deluxe version of a dog collar			2
hero to zero : @entity49 created a buzz with her weird @entity51 style sheer jumpsuits long - suffering : @entity65 's collar and coat combo , and @entity60 's modern caveman @entity78 : lovely dress , shame about the hat @entity82 : is this the world 's most bouffant fringe ? @entity86 : a novel collar inspired by an ammonite fossil show stopper : @entity91 actress @entity90 showed @entity5 's fashionistas how its done the girls did n't escape the weirdness either , with @entity78 sending models out in chic tailored dresses teamed with bizarre gnome - like hats			1
equally odd were the bouffant fringes at @entity100 which looked witchy peeking out from voluminous black hooded capes			0
meanwhile , @entity86 appeared to take inspiration from ammonite fossils , with a strange set of collars that strongly resembled the prehistoric mollusc			0
but not every look was a bad one			0
@entity113 body paint aside , the rest of @entity15 's collection included some wonderfully wearable dresses , among them a standout red brocade shift			1
@entity118 's wonderful pansy photo prints were good enough to be confused with @entity119 , while @entity120 offered up a collection crammed with delicate maxi dresses			0
also worth a second look was @entity125 's riff on monochrome that resulted in quirky black and white candy stripes splashed on everything from boots to coats			0
but even @entity125 could n't hold a candle to the truly fashionable @entity132 , who wowed the @entity5 fashion pack with her bold choices at the @entity5 premiere of @entity136			1
appearing with co-star , @entity137 , the @entity91 actress ' wardrobe choices included a stunning dusty blue lace dress and a flattering deep purple printed coat			2
elegant : @entity120 offered up a wearable collection heavily focused on flowing maxi dresses and skirts big improvement : @entity118 demonstrates how print should be done with theses stunning pansies			0
