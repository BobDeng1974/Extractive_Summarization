mystery surrounds the death of a celebrated computer hacker who claimed to know how to remotely kill someone fitted with a heart pacemaker – as happened in the fictional tv spy drama @entity7			2
@entity8 died in @entity9 on thursday , just days before he was due to give a speech revealing how implanted heart devices were at risk from fatal hacking attacks			1
the @entity9 medical examiner ’s office confirmed the death last night but did not give any further details			0
he gained notoriety after demonstrating how to hack into @entity23 ( pictured right ) @entity25 - born @entity8 , 35 , was scheduled to be one of the star guests at the @entity28 hacking convention in @entity30 next week			1
in a presentation called @entity32 , he was planning to highlight the shortcomings of commonly used pacemaker machines by demonstrating how he could hack into them and kill the heart patient from 50ft away with a deadly power surge triggered by a wireless transmitter			1
an episode of the acclaimed @entity41 series @entity7 , starring @entity42 and @entity43 , showed a terrorist using a computer to hack into the vice-president ’s pacemaker and speed up his heartbeat until it kills him			2
in homeland , the killer needed the serial number of the pacemaker , but @entity8 argued that in real life it was even simpler and knowing the code was not necessary			1
in a recent blog , he said : ‘ the only implausible aspect of the hack was the range in which the attack was carried out			0
' the attacker would have had to be in the same building or have a transmitter set up closer to the target			0
with that said , the scenario was not too far - fetched			0
’ he said some pacemakers could be commanded to deliver a deadly 830 - volt shock from someone on a laptop up to 50ft away , the result of poor software programming by medical device companies			0
@entity8 had claimed he had developed a technique for hacking pacemakers ( file photograph ) @entity8 claimed it was possible to infect the pacemaker companies ’ servers with a bug that would spread through their system like a virus			1
‘ we are potentially looking at a worm with the ability to commit mass murder , ’ he added			0
‘ it ’s kind of scary			0
’ the possibility of such attacks is being taken so seriously by the @entity92 ( @entity92 ) that it has asked manufacturers to ensure greater protection for newer pacemakers which use wireless technology			0
@entity8 became one of the world ’s most famous hackers after a 2010 demonstration of ‘ @entity101 ’ – getting cash machines to spew out money			1
at the time of his death , @entity8 was director of embedded - device security for @entity108 information - security firm @entity107			1
the company said in a tweet : ‘ lost but never forgotten , our beloved pirate , @entity8 , has passed			2
