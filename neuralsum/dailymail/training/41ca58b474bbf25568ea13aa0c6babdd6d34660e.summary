captaincy is a serious business , but it wo n’t force the fun out of @entity3			1
the @entity5 prop will go to @entity6 today determined to carry on epitomising his club ’s colourful image			2
a @entity9 is defined as a ‘ joker ’ and a ‘ jester ’ , in which case the new skipper will stay true to the logo on his chest			1
the armband around his sleeve will not remove the grin from his face			2
a @entity9 is also defined as a ‘ mute character in a traditional pantomime ’ , but in that regard the cap does n’t fit			1
@entity3 can be relied upon to keep delivering his trademark one - liners and generally maintaining a vocal presence , despite the responsibility of his new role			1
captain : @entity3 is hoping to bring his own brand of captaincy to @entity9 ‘ i have no idea yet what sort of captain i ’m going to be , ’ said the 24 - year - old ahead of his side ’s @entity35 opener against @entity37 ; @entity41 of the annual @entity43 extravaganza at @entity44 , following the opening game between @entity46 and @entity47			1
‘ but i ’m not going to change a huge amount in the way i am			2
‘ there ’s being a joker and being obstructive and there ’s just having a laugh and enjoying the job			2
‘ i ’ll probably have to stop shouting things out in meetings as much and accept that just before a game is not the best time for practical jokes ! ’ all the indications are that the jester in @entity3 is not going to be suppressed by leadership			1
he is in no hurry to ditch the non-conformist streak			2
respect : @entity3 is only 24 but has played over 100 games for @entity9 and has 22 caps for @entity5 age : 24 position : prop height : 6ft weight : 17st 5lb @entity75 began playing rugby at @entity77			1
n joined the @entity9 academy in june 2008			1
@entity9 apps : 105 tries : 5 @entity82 @entity83 against @entity84 in 2008			1
also played for the @entity85 and @entity86			0
senior debut : v @entity88 , june 2012 total caps : 22 back in december , 2011 the rookie loosehead played for @entity9 at a sold - out @entity6 with his familiar @entity91 supplemented by hair forming the words ‘ @entity96 sausage ’ to advertise team - mate @entity98 ’s catering company			1
other slogans and patterns have followed , and the eye - catching trend wo n’t necessarily end with the club captaincy role			1
‘ i do n’t know if i will do something like that again — no - one has approached me for some time , ’ he said			2
‘ but i ’m open to offers ! ’ in recent years , @entity9 have been led by @entity5 captain @entity109 — a very different character to @entity3 , more serious , less exuberant — but the club ’s director of rugby , @entity111 , had no doubts about making this appointment and does n’t want a clone			1
‘ @entity3 is a natural - born leader , ’ said the @entity116			1
‘ he has played over 100 times for the club and he ’s got 20 - odd caps for @entity5			2
he is one of the most respected blokes in our squad			0
wind - up : @entity3 admitted he was initially unsure about taking the role and thought the offer was a wind - up ‘ will he live and learn ? yes , but i do n’t want him to be @entity109 , @entity128 ( another former @entity9 captain ) or @entity130 ... i want him to be @entity3 , bringing his own brand of leadership			1
‘ he will make some unbelievable decisions and he might also get questioned the odd time , because that goes with the job			0
you are up there to be shot at			0
but we do not want him to morph into something he ’s not			0
he was picked to be captain because he is @entity3			1
’ the new skipper had led a team only once before — reluctantly — as a teenager			0
he gave a frank assessment of his efforts			0
‘ it was an @entity5 under 18s training game at @entity148 , ’ said @entity3			1
‘ i said no ( to the captaincy ) , but ended up doing it anyway			0
‘ it was a training game against the @entity153 academies			0
we won by 30 - odd points but in the last play of the game we got a penalty and i told @entity159 to kick the goal because i was hanging ( exhausted )			2
it was a training game and i should n’t have done that but i was too tired ! ‘ he did kick the goal , he nailed it , but i do n’t know if i would do that again			0
i might go at it @entity167 style — they are decent crowd favourites who never go for the posts			0
we ’ll see how it goes			0
’ decision : after being ' apprehensive ' about taking the role , @entity3 took advice from those close to him when @entity111 approached @entity3 about taking on the role , the offer was initially treated as a wind - up			1
it was no such thing and the man in charge gave the player space to think about whether or not he wanted the armband and the responsibility			0
the immediate inclination to decline was gradually overcome			0
‘ i was initially shocked and i looked for every possible reason not to do it because i was a bit scared and apprehensive , ’ said @entity3			1
‘ i took a while to think about it and i spoke to a few people — @entity188 , @entity189 ( another @entity191 captain ) and my partner ( @entity192 ) — then decided to give it a crack			2
’ asked if leading a team containing the current @entity5 captain was an onerous prospect , he added : ‘ @entity188 is a good , decent bloke and when i spoke to him , he said , “ go for it , i think it will be good ”			2
he will back me all the way			0
to have guys like him , @entity195 , @entity196 and @entity197 around makes my life easier			0
’ his first task , starting today , will be to oversee a better start to this domestic season than @entity9 had last year , to avoid the need for another late charge			1
prop : @entity3 faces a duel with @entity214 of @entity215 to be @entity5 ’s first - choice loosehead prop ‘ we ’re really excited , ’ he said			1
‘ our realistic goal is to be far more consistent			0
we went on a great run at the end of last season that got us into the semi-finals , but ideally we do n’t want to have to do that ; where every game is a must - win			2
’ on a personal level , @entity3 faces an intriguing duel with @entity214 of @entity215 to start the autumn test series as @entity5 ’s first - choice loosehead prop			1
‘ i ’m very realistic about where i stand with @entity5 , ’ he said			0
‘ i will try my hardest this season to push for that @entity232 squad because it is a massive dream and a massive goal			0
but if i do n’t take care of club business , i will be nowhere near it			0
‘ if your club is doing well , you have a chance to be looked at more than others when it comes to @entity5 selection			0
and i suppose being captain of @entity9 ca n’t hurt			1
’ it certainly ca n’t			0
the jester with the armband has a glorious opportunity to expand his repertoire at the best possible time .			0
