by @entity1 reporter published : 04:06 est , 14 may 2013 updated : 09:22 est , 15 may 2013 this fearless daredevil must have his head in the clouds - as he bravely edges across a highline a stomach - churning 3000ft above the ground outside @entity7 in @entity8			1
@entity9 can be seen in these incredible images carefully moving forward inch by inch across the thin wire with the breathtaking backdrop of fluffy clouds and a magnificent glowing skyline behind him as the sun sets			2
in a different photo @entity9 , who has been slacklining and base jumping for the past 10 years , crosses another line without even wearing a harness - and only water and rocks below him if he falls			1
@entity9 , from @entity46 , @entity47 , said : ' i 'm really confident with my abilities on the slackline so when i stroll across it almost does n't look that hard			2
' the better you get the more effortless it looks so people sometimes struggle to understand the technical aspect and the skill behind it			0
' it 's really painful to balance on the tops of your ankles like that and takes years to build up the strength needed be able to do it			0
' a lot of the time doing what i do means if i lose balance i either catch the line or die - it 's that simple but it makes you feel free having so little choices up there			0
walking in the air : @entity9 , who has been slacklining and base jumping for the past 10 years , carefully inches along the highline ' if i were to lose my balance it would take a lot for me to miss the line			1
' photographer @entity80 , originally from @entity81 , @entity82 , risks his own life to capture @entity9 's spectacular stunts but insists the group are skilled enough to do what they do			1
he said : ' on a scale of one to ten highlining really is quite safe if you set up properly			0
but when you do it without a leash the danger level dramatically rises			0
' we 're all experienced so like to think the risk is fairly low however we accept the consequences are very high - sometimes death if a fall freesoloing or with the ankle leash slipping off			0
' quite a setting : the @entity8 jungle gives way to a settlement in the background as @entity9 crosses a highline without a harness , pictured left			2
he is part of a group of slackliners called the @entity41 who continuously push themselves to more challenging highline walks beautiful backdrop : the sea can be seen in the distance as @entity9 walks a highline with nothing but sharp rocks and vegetation below			1

@entity9 has 10 years of experience slacklining and base jumping around the world
he is part of the @entity41 - a group of *talented* slackliners - who take on only the most daring highline walks
