model opened up in interview with @entity3 magazine @entity4 is a tomboy who does n't care about looking pretty modelling @entity6 's new jewellery line by @entity7 published : 07:14 est , 27 november 2012 updated : 17:16 est , 27 november 2012 she was born into rock ’ n ’ roll royalty with @entity12 frontman @entity11 and former supermodel @entity13 as parents , so it is no surprise that @entity17 is heading for similar success			1
the genetically blessed 20 - year - old famed for her iconic gap - tooth smile made her mark when 26 million people watched her walk the catwalk of the @entity24 with the world 's top supermodels			2
and her latest campaign is equally as glamorous : modelling quintessentially @entity30 designer ( and close family friend ) @entity6 's new jewellery line			1
@entity32 was destined for success when she was born into a family of rock stars and models but this is n't the first time the pair have met			2
in fact , @entity6 designed a custom - made dress for a seven - year - old @entity42 may after she threw a tantrum when she saw her mother and sister being dressed by the @entity46			1
but @entity6 insists that both @entity42 may and sister @entity47 are down - to - earth girls , and they have their mother to thank for that			2
@entity17 has modelled for @entity6 before ( @entity51 ) and has also been an ambassador for @entity53 speaking to @entity3 magazine , @entity6 said : ' she [ @entity55 ] brought up the children really well			1
they 're always well - behaved			0
' @entity42 may , who has fronted a campaign for @entity61 jeans and is set to work with designer @entity62 , follows in the footsteps of her sister @entity47 , 28 , who began her catwalk career aged 14 , and her mother , who recently starred on @entity68			0
she strutted her stuff before millions of viewers worldwide at the @entity24 along with @entity72 and @entity73 but she maintains that her life is n't as glamorous as it seems			0
' people think i wake up every day and have my make - up done			0
it 's really not like that , ' she told @entity3			1
instead she spends many of her days with best friend and fellow model of the moment @entity83 , but wants us to know there is more to the thick eyebrowed 20 - year - old than meets the eye			0
@entity17 and @entity88 have become best friends through modelling but she maintains the @entity88 is just a tomboy who does n't care about looking pretty ' @entity88 's a massive tomboy ... and not very fabulous at all ! i mean , obviously she is , but i see her in a completely different way			1
' i know her as a she really is , which is funny and wearing , oh , some kind of jumpsuit			0
she does n't care about looking pretty			1
' i should n't be outing her , ' she said			0
@entity17 is following in the footsteps of her mother and former supermodel @entity13			0
