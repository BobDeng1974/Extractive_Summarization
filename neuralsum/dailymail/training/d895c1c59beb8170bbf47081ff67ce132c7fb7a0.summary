by @entity0 published : 20:20 est , 24 october 2013 updated : 00:58 est , 25 october 2013 a lot of married couples talk about being ' saved ' by each other , but newlyweds @entity5 and @entity7 mean it literally			1
if @entity5 had never met @entity10 there 's a good chance he would n't be alive today since she provided a much - needed kidney transplant when his had almost completely stopped working			1
the two were married this past october 12 , four years after they first met and three years after that life - saving organ donation			1
commitment : @entity5 married @entity7 in a ceremony earlier this month			1
the couple met four years ago and on the day they met , @entity10 offered to donate her kidney to the ailing @entity5 in an interview with the @entity22 , the couple talked about the day they met - september 12 , 2009			1
at the time @entity5 was in his last year of high school in @entity25 , @entity26 , and what doctor 's believed was his last year of life			1
he met @entity10 at a car show , when the 22 - year - old friend of a friend was going through a divorce			1
after hanging out with @entity5 that day , @entity10 offered him her kidney as they were parting			1
he did n't think much of it though			0
many people had offered him a kidney in the past and he learned not to get his hopes up			0
meant to be : the kidney donation was a success as the two were a near perfect match , medically and , eventually , romantically @entity10 was different though			1
she followed through and got tested and it turned out that the two were ' an almost perfect match '			0
part of her commitment to donating her kidney was the fact that her father passed away after never finding a bone marrow transplant			0
but it was n't an easy road to donation			0
after watching a video of a kidney operation , @entity10 's mother told her not to do it and that caused the mother and daughter to become distant			2
' i felt like i had nobody , ' @entity10 said			0
the two went into surgery six months after first meeting , and @entity5 drove @entity10 to @entity69 that day			1
a perfect match : the surgery was a success and @entity5 's body accepted @entity10 's kidney immediately once at the hospital , @entity10 started to panic			1
she was going to be the first one operated on , and before being wheeled away into the @entity78 , she grabbed onto @entity5 and said ' please do n't let go '			2
the donation that brought them together : the two officially started dating after the kidney operation despite @entity10 's fears , the operation was a success and @entity5 's body accepted the new kidney immediately			1
when they both awoke after the procedure , their first words were about each other			0
' is @entity89 ? ' @entity10 asked			0
' how 's @entity10 ? ' @entity5 said			2
while recovering the two had to be kept separate so @entity5 would n't get an infection but he kept asking the nurses to wheel him past @entity10 so he could wave into her room			2
it was n't until after the donation that the two became an item			0
' there 's a bond that no one else , unless they 've done it , can know			0
she 's my best friend , ' @entity5 said			2
in addition to other milestones of their relationship , the two now celebrate the anniversary of the kidney transplant , a day they call ' @entity112 ' ( they named the kidney @entity114 )			0
it 's become a sort - of inside joke between the two			0
@entity10 often threatens to take back the kidney			2
' he 's carrying around my kidney			0
i have to make sure he takes of that , ' @entity10 said			0
three years after @entity10 gave @entity5 her kidney , the two exchanged vows at the @entity126 at their wedding ceremony on october 12 , the couple opted out of the traditional vows of ' in sickness and in health ' and wrote something meaningful to them : ' i offer you my hand , my heart and my soul , as i know they will be safe with you			1

when his kidneys practically stopped functioning at the age of *19* , @entity5 was desperate to find a donor
despite many of his family and friends offering to donate a kidney to him , he struggled to find a match
in september 2009 , @entity5 met 22 - year - old @entity7 , a friend of a friend , at a car show and she offered him her kidney that same day
six months later the two went into operation and the transfer was successful
it was n't until after the donation that the two began seeing each other romantically
about four years after first meeting and offering to give up her kidney , @entity10 married @entity5 in a ceremony in @entity166 , @entity26
