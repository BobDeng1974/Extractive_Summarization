@entity0 celebrates scoring for @entity1 in last year 's @entity25 semi-final against @entity26 at @entity27 ' they do n't really touch each other and it 's not like that in our league			1
' the @entity11 is an unbelievable league , probably the best in the world but then teams are n't used to getting barged about , people in the faces , kicking them and not helping them up when they get kicked			0
' there 's a lot of matey matey stuff in the @entity11			1
' i 've got a couple of mates in football but i do n't like it at all - hugging and kissing each other before games and all that			0
' my best mate , @entity50 , is in the same team as me now but if i was playing against him , i would n't speak to him until the game 's finished			0
' it 's all gone a bit crazy in the @entity11 but that 's probably why they are where they are			0

' @entity16 has already guided @entity1 past @entity61 in the @entity8 and @entity73 in the @entity25			1
last season they beat @entity76 and @entity77 in the @entity25 before losing 5 - 3 to @entity26 at @entity27 in the last four			2
@entity0 added : ' once you beat the big teams your confidence grows			2
' the more big teams that come to @entity82 or we go to them , they will be wary because we have knocked a few big teams out			0
the 22 - year - old pictured in action during the @entity15 side 's @entity8 quarter final @entity0 vies for the ball during a @entity91 match for @entity18 in december 2009 ' we have stated it a little bit that we are a good cup team			1
we just need to put it right in the league			0
' if you think you just have to turn up to beat a @entity15 team , then you 've got another thing coming			2
' we 've obviously got respect for them , but we 'll go out there to boss them about and to things to them that @entity11 teams do n't do and it 's worked			0
' our run increases our belief that we can beat anyone in the cups and we showed that last season too			0
' look at @entity61 , they 've beaten everyone in the league and are high - flying in the @entity11 , so for them to come here and for us to beat them , shows we can really beat anyone			1
