by @entity0 published : 18:33 est , 10 december 2013 updated : 04:51 est , 11 december 2013 thousands of pensioners will pay more for fuel this winter after energy giant @entity3 scrapped a cheaper tariff for the elderly			1
the company blamed a @entity8 plan to simplify tariffs for the closure of its @entity12 deal which offered a cheaper fuel price to those over 60			1
it has written to customers to tell them that they have been ‘ renewed ’ on to its standard fixed rate variable tariff - which costs around £ 78 more per year			1
pensioners hit : energy giant @entity3 has scrapped its @entity12 deal which offered a cheaper price fuel to over 60s it is the second tariff for the elderly that the company has ended after it axed its @entity26 deal two months ago , leaving tens of thousands of customers facing bill increases of as much as £ 180			1
@entity3 , one of the @entity12 ’s biggest suppliers , blamed the prime minister ’s energy tariff simplification plan for the withdrawal of the tariff			1
but pressure groups , customers and @entity37 yesterday accused the companies of using the @entity39 as an excuse to axe some of the best deals			2
the plan was announced last year with great fanfare as a way of enabling consumers to better compare energy tariffs			0
it restricted the number of products each provider can offer to four for electricity and four for gas			0
there were previously a bewildering array of 500 products on offer			0
aides claimed the issue was ‘ close to [ the prime minister ’s ] heart ’ as figures show that as many as seven in ten households pay over the odds for power - some by as much as £ 300 a year			2
@entity3 customer @entity66 , who was on the @entity12 tariff , accused the company of using the changes as an excuse to put prices up for older people on cheap deals			1
the pensioner was on a standard variable @entity12 tariff which he claimed was better value than everything else on the market when he originally signed up to it			1
he was pleased with the deal and remained on it for roughly five years , but was contacted on december 6 and told that the tariff was being axed			2
in the letter to the 65 - year - old from @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity3 wrote : ‘ we ’re closing your tariff and moving you to @entity89			2
it is the second tariff for the elderly that the company has ended after it axed its @entity26 deal two months ago , leaving tens of thousands of customers facing bill increases of as much as £ 180 ‘ as part of an industry wide programme to create a simpler and clearer , fairer and more competitive energy market , we ’ve changed our tariffs and the way we pay you any discounts			1
’ the letter goes on to estimate that the new tariff will cost mr @entity66 £ 78 more a year and cancels a three per cent energy discount and @entity12 cold weather payments that he previously received			1
it also advises him that he can switch to other deals and other suppliers and informed him about a new fixed rate @entity12 deal it offers			1
but mr @entity66 , a retired @entity116 manager , and his wife , who also worked for @entity116 before she retired , said that the new @entity12 tariff offered by @entity3 was more expensive			1
‘ @entity120 they just took me off the deal and put me on a more expensive one			2
they are using the @entity8 review as an excuse to remove cheap tariffs , ’ he said			0
‘ they ’re getting round what ’s going to happen by cutting their cheapest tariffs			0
their four tariffs wo n’t be cheaper ones			2
‘ it ’s probably legally ok but it ’s not morally ok			0
they ’re screwing the pensioners yet again			0
’ @entity137 , energy expert at @entity139 , said : ‘ simplification is a good thing for consumers as the energy market has been notoriously difficult for people to get their heads around			0
‘ however , it ’s important that simplification does n’t come at a cost			0
the biggest danger is that consumers start to lose discounts and incentives that are valuable to them			0
‘ this would be like throwing the baby out with the bath water : penalising the savvy who are already shopping around , while removing any incentive that could encourage non-switchers to join in			0
’ on average bills will be £ 60 higher than before this year 's round of price hikes even after the government deal to reduce green levies by £ 50 an @entity3 spokeswoman refused to confirm how many customers were on the @entity12 plan for ‘ commercial ’ reasons			1
she said : ‘ to make the market simpler and easier to compare we now offer four core tariffs as part of the new rules being introduced by @entity37			0
‘ we ’ve written to customers on historic variable products to advise them that their tariff is no longer available and that we ’ll be moving them to our standard offering ( as required )			1
‘ we hope to have ‘ best deal for you ’ conversations with these customers about whether there is a better or more suitable product for their needs and urge customers to get in touch			2
‘ we will continue to offer @entity12 fixed products exclusively for the over 60s			1
’ age @entity12 take a commission of around 1.5per cent from the tariffs through their enterprise arm which raises money for the charity			1
@entity197 , managing director of @entity198 , said : ‘ while reducing the number of energy tariffs available should help simplify the market following the implementation of the @entity204 , this customer highlights the important concern that many older people are unaware of the changes taking place and what action they need to take			0
‘ in the first instance , people should contact their energy supplier to ensure they are on the best tariff - what is important is for all older people to check their energy costs and ensure they are on the best deal for them			2
’ an @entity37 spokesman said : ‘ a key part of our reforms is a restriction on suppliers offering no more than four tariffs for gas and four for electricity			0
we have never told suppliers which tariffs they have to close to comply with this rule , as that is a decision for them			0
‘ and in fact we have been clear with all suppliers that they are allowed to keep social tariffs ( which for example offer discounts to customers who have difficulty paying bills ) under our rules			0
