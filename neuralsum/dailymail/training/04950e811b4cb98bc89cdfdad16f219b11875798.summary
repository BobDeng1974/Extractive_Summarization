by @entity0 my wife and i are happily snuggled on the sofa watching television , large glasses of red wine in hand			1
the children — @entity8 , nine , and @entity9 , six — are finally tucked up in bed			1
it ’s a typical evening in the @entity0 household , except for one thing — there have been no fights over what to watch , despite the fact that i ’m immersed in a documentary about the @entity19 on the yesterday channel , a programme which would usually send my wife @entity22 mad with boredom			1
the sound of @entity26 dive - bombing echoes in my ears without her usual refrain : ‘ it ’s black and white and you know who won the war			1
why is this interesting ? ’ then , over the roar of battle , @entity35 ’s unmistakeable voice rings out , opining on @entity39 ’s tattoo			1
it is unnerving , but not as unnerving as seeing ghostly goose - stepping germans behind @entity35 ’s bright red hair when i take off my special spectacles			1
the future ? @entity0 sits with his wife @entity22 in front of the new split - screen @entity47 we are trialling the revolutionary new £ 6,999 @entity49 , which can show two programmes at once			1
it promises to defuse the classic marital arguments over whether to watch @entity53 or the football			1
the so - called smart tv is the biggest i ’ve ever seen , with a beautifully curved 55in screen			1
it can also dim or brighten its screen automatically according to the room ambience			1
you can change channels by talking to it or scroll through them with a flick of your hand			1
it can recommend programmes , allow you to email , tweet , store photos and music and probably put your kids to bed for you , too			1
now , i love telly , even our knackered £ 100 @entity75 one			1
we even have a saying : a couple that watches telly together , stays together			1
if the arguments over what to watch do n’t split us up , of course			1
as we ’ve grown older ( we ’re both 42 ) , it seems what ’s good for the goggle - eyed goose is rarely good for the gander			1
so it is little wonder that , waiting for the arrival of our super-telly , our excitement grew			1
at last , no more wasteful hours listening to my wife sob , ‘ look at that dear little baby ! ’ on @entity101 , or sensing her schadenfreude at a collapsed @entity98 sponge on @entity99			1
instead , i ’d be able to watch my programmes — shows that tap into the fact that men are still , on the whole , genetically wired as caveman			1
instead of standing guard over lit fires with a wooden club in our mammoth pelts , we now monitor wider threats to our tribe by watching programmes about asteroids plummeting through space towards us			1
or we learn how to hone our physiques — vital for our family ’s safety — by watching sportsmen			1
yet first , my wife must set up the telly , wisely asking me to leave the room ‘ as you ’ll only end up shouting at it ’			2
technology : the television blurs the two programmes together			2
viewers wear 3d glasses - with in - built earphones - that separate the images so two can watch different shows at the same time two hours later , she was shouting at it			2
specifically , she was shouting : ‘ it ’s one step removed in complexity from a particle accelerator and yet it ’s come with less instructions than i got with @entity8 ’s @entity140 watch ! ’ a mysterious ‘ input source ’ needed to be located			2
four hours on , my wife had found her own input source — two glasses of @entity144			2
thanks to this calming influence , and no thanks to me ( ‘ do n’t get involved now after i have been working on this for hours ’ ) , we were sourced and our @entity150 was sorted			2
on screen , the two programmes blur together			2
then , if you put on the 3d glasses with inbuilt earphones , the images separate , so that i can see one show and @entity22 can see another			2
plugged in like this , we look like characters from a less suspenseful version of @entity161			2
or ‘ total nerds ’ as our children call us			2
so , the verdict ? well , the voice recognition was hopeless			2
we ’d issue seemingly idiot - proof commands — ‘ @entity167 ’ — and a robotic americanised voice would intone : ‘ @entity169 in there a little longer please , ’ or : ‘ i could n’t find the content you requested			2
’ i choose @entity174 : the soldier ’s story on the yesterday channel , while @entity22 opts for a re ‑ run of @entity180 ’s @entity179			2
i could enjoy watching tv with my beloved wife without having to watch any of her unbeloved dross			0
but after a while i feel lonely sitting there with earphones on			0
@entity22 is shouting : ‘ you idiot ! ’ at her programme			0
‘ who ’s an idiot ? ’ i ask			0
unsure : despite enjoying looking like characters from @entity193 - the couple both felt a bit lonely , and left out , watching their own programmes ‘ stop bellowing , ’ she bellows back , thanks to the earphones			0
feeling left out , i switch a button on my glasses to allow me to watch her choice of tv , making the occasional snidey remark about how that woman looked a bit like goose from the movie @entity206 — which , thanks to an attached microphone you can turn on when you want , she can hear in her headset			0
i am being an idiot and she is putting up with me			0
things are back to normal			0
later that night in bed , vowing to return immediately to our £ 100 @entity75 telly , we repeat our @entity218 - like mantra : couples that watch telly together , stay together			1
while i think my husband usually has impeccable taste — he married me , for one thing — i must take issue with his tv programmes of choice , which revolve around two themes : sport and war			0
i have n’t seen a period drama since 1998 because @entity0 hates them , and i have to put up with him complaining relentlessly through the reality shows which i love ( @entity234 / @entity233 )			0
i was delighted to be treated to some frothy nonsense for once , courtesy of our shiny new tv , and cheerfully tucked into a re-run of this morning			0
( the last time i saw @entity240 on tv he was sporting a scarily spiky hair style and presenting going live ! ) at first , both of us revelled in our new - found tv independence			0
i looked over at @entity0 on the sofa , his face deadly serious as he absorbed the horrors of @entity249 , and felt pleased we had avoided the usual channel wrangle			0
meanwhile , i was amazed to see agony aunt @entity251 was still administering softly spoken @entity253 words of wisdom on this morning			0
she was doing this the last time i watched the show , when @entity257 was still jumping about on a floating weather map in the @entity259			0
worth the cash ? the pair found the new technology did nothing for their relationship - as they did n't share the television watching experience but , after an hour , i started feeling a bit lonely			0
there was an unnerving silence in the living room as we sat with our earpieces corked in			0
every now and then @entity0 would shout : ‘ why are you shaking your head in disgust ? or ‘ what are you laughing at ? ’ and quickly switch his headset to my channel , by which time the joke had passed , @entity240 had stopped giggling and the person talking about their piles on a phone - in had hung up			0
my earpiece ( which must be frequently recharged ) cut in and out , so i missed a crucial piece of information about how i could win £ 25,000			1
sometimes , when you switch between programmes , it takes a minute or so for the sound to catch up , so i also had a very unnerving moment when commentary about @entity296 ’s @entity295 advancing on the @entity297 provided the soundtrack to an item about whether it was ever right to abort a disabled baby			0
losing concentration , i started looking over the top of my glasses , with the result that hundreds of @entity306 troops were running through @entity251 ’s carefully - teased curls			0
overall , this experience is not great for our relationship			0
i noticed that @entity0 and i were sitting further apart on the sofa than normal			0
what ’s more , sometimes i can persuade him to massage my feet in exchange for agreeing to watch @entity315 , and this brave new telly world is threatening that			0
secretly , we love the argy - bargy that comes with channel - choosing			0
favours are traded ( ‘ you uncork the @entity324 and i ’ll find an old @entity325 on the @entity326 ’ ) , questions are posed ( ‘ how come the @entity332 always manage to smash a terrorist cell in exactly one hour ? ’ ) and games are played ( our personal favourite being @entity329 in the @entity331 crowd )			0
would i like a @entity49 ? well , the picture is crisp and fabulous , the smart apps fun and the voice recognition a hoot ( ‘ @entity338 on now ! ’ )			1
but if having one means losing the shared jokes and the crafty sofa hugs , i ’ll keep my old - fashioned gogglebox for now			0
the @entity49 is available at @entity342			1
road to @entity344 by @entity0 is published by @entity345 priced £ 8.99 .			1
