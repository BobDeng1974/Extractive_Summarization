former secretary of defense @entity0 said in an interview released monday morning that @entity2 should prepare themselves for the country to be at war with the @entity5 and other terrorist groups for decades to come in his upcoming memoir @entity0 , who also served as director of the @entity36 , rehashes the foreign policy decisions made president @entity39 during his four - year tenor in his administration , including @entity39 's judgement call not to leave troops in @entity30 after the conclusion of the @entity2 occupation of the country			1
that ' created a vacuum in terms of the ability of that country to better protect itself , and it 's out of that vacuum that @entity29 began to breed , ' @entity0 told @entity11			2
@entity39 's decision not to confront @entity31 president @entity54 with military force after previously warning that he would face consequences if he crossed a ' red line ' by using chemical weapons on his citizens was also a mistake , @entity0 said			1
the former @entity39 administration official told @entity11 the backtrack harmed @entity39 's credibility internationally			2
standing up to @entity65 extremists now could give @entity39 a chance to ' repair the damage , ' @entity0 said , after having ' lost his way			2
' @entity0 's criticism of the commander in chief comes as allies of the president on @entity73 have begun to call his handling of the situations in @entity30 and @entity31 , as well other terrorist hot spots , into question , as well			1
on sunday @entity79 sen. @entity78 , a @entity80 eyeing a 2016 presidential run , argued that no president , including @entity39 , has ' had a clear articulation of what @entity2 foreign policy is basically since the end of the @entity87			1
' looking at places like @entity30 and @entity31 , you ’re seeing policies that ca n’t be clearly articulated , ' @entity78 said on @entity92 's @entity91			1
' it ’s not just about @entity29 , ' @entity94 sen. @entity93 said sunday during an interview on @entity98 radio station 970 am			0
' this is a global jihad with many locations ... @entity19 , @entity20 and elsewhere where organizations have sworn themselves to kill as many @entity104 , @entity105 and @entity106 as they can to establish their religious order , ' the @entity102 senator said , according to @entity108			2
@entity93 argued that the @entity2 ' underestimated the threat of a global jihad			0
' ' @entity29 is just a part of it , ' he said			0
' this is a global jihad that comes out of the @entity65 religion			0
our intelligence underestimated the threat , and the president did as well			0
' @entity0 is speaking out about his views on world affairs to promote his memoir , which comes out on tuesday republicans joined their @entity102 colleagues in questioning the wisdom of president @entity39 's policies in a barrage of attacks on the sunday morning news shows			1
referencing @entity39 's repeated claims that he will not send @entity2 combat forces into @entity30 , @entity131 majority leader @entity130 said , ' i do n't think we should ever sit back and tell our enemies what we will and will not do			1
' if we need special forces there - if that 's what the generals say - then we need to do it , ' @entity130 said on @entity144 ' @entity145			0
' if we engage in a conflict that we know this is a threat to @entity2 , we should make it so one - sided that it gets over very quickly			0
so , we should have everything on the table to make sure we win this			0
' @entity154 sen. @entity153 argued on @entity156 's @entity155 that he too thought @entity39 erred in promising not to put boots on the ground			2
' there is no way i can see how we ’re going to fix the problem in @entity30 in @entity31 without @entity2 ground troops , ' @entity153 said , according to @entity164			1
' this mythical @entity166 army we ’re trying to get up to go in on the ground in @entity31 will need a lot of @entity2 hand - holding			2
' both men were referring to comments made by @entity172 , gen. @entity173 , suggesting that the @entity2 may not be able to defeat @entity29 without using its own ground troops because the @entity30 army is ill equipped to fight the terrorist group			2
@entity178 sen. @entity177 , another @entity179 , expressed worry on sunday that the president is n't planning on destroying the the violent extremist group at all , even though he 's assured the public that he will			0
' i ’m fearful that as we look at the current military strategy that it is surrounding the november elections and that he wo n’t have the resolve to follow through with what needs to be done in a sustained effort to destroy @entity29 , ' she said			0
despite his negative assessment of @entity39 's recent choices , @entity0 told @entity11 he still believes the president can still turn the situation around , not just for the country , but for himself during his remaining time in office			1
' he may have found himself again with regards to this @entity29 crisis			0
i hope that 's the case , ' @entity0 said			0
' and if he 's willing to roll up his sleeves and engage with @entity203 in taking on some of these other issues , as i said i think he can establish a very strong legacy as president			0
' i think these next 2 1/2 years will tell us an awful lot about what history has to say about the @entity39 administration , ' he concluded .			0

threats posed by emerging terrorist groups in @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 and other countries will keep the @entity2 military engaged
