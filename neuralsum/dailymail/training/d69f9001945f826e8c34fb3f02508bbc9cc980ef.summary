a young @entity1 man has been stabbed to death in @entity3 , east @entity4 , in an attack which is feared to be connected to recent ' @entity7 ' marches in the city @entity10 , 20 , an @entity11 - born @entity1 , was found stabbed to death in the early hours of tuesday , @entity3 prosecution office has said			1
his body was discovered the day after 40,000 people joined a weekly march organised by an organisation called ' @entity16 of the @entity17 ' ( @entity18 )			1
he was found dead outside his house on tuesday morning , police say			2
@entity3 prosecution office has launched ' an extensive investigation ' into the murder			1
@entity18 marches has become a weekly sight in @entity3 in recent months , and up to 40,000 is said to have taken to the streets on monday , the day of mr @entity10 's disappearance			1
thousands were seen waving @entity4 flags in the dark and chanting ' @entity37 ' ( lying press ) , a @entity40 term , and ' @entity41 ' ( we are the people )			0
possible connection : stabbing victim @entity10 , 20 , an @entity11 - born @entity1 , had left his house to go shopping on monday , the same night as the @entity18 march in @entity3 growing numbers : a supporter of the @entity18 movement in @entity50 holds a sticker with a crossed mosque symbol while supporters gathered for a march in their first demonstration in the @entity4 capital this month the record number of marchers were emboldened by the @entity60 attack on @entity62 magazine @entity61			1
co-founder @entity63 , 41 , says his ' @entity16 of the @entity17 ' campaign , born on @entity65 three months ago , represents the silent majority and has huge potential across @entity4 and @entity68			1
' this is the tip of the iceberg , ' @entity63 , who has a criminal conviction for burglary , told @entity73 in an interview			0
while @entity18 leaders deny they are racist and are careful to distinguish between @entity79 and most of @entity4 's 4 million @entity1 , slogans like ' no @entity76 ! ' and ' in 2035 @entity4 will be a minority ! ' betray a hostility to foreigners			1
at monday 's rally , @entity63 called on politicians to force immigrants to integrate			0
' every religion is welcome in @entity4			0
but you ca n't try to influence @entity4 culture and life , ' @entity86 , a @entity18 co-founder , told @entity73			1
to the 35,000 people who joined a state - organised protest against @entity18 on saturday in @entity3 and about 100,000 across @entity4 on monday , the movement is openly racist			1
' they are using a fear of @entity79 to put chauvinism and racism on the street , ' said @entity98 of @entity3 's @entity99			2
@entity100 has condemned the movement using strong language calling its members racists ' with hatred in their hearts			0
' the debate has exposed divisions among her conservative supporters on how to tackle rising immigration			0
a new protest party , the @entity112 ( @entity112 ) , is gaining ground as a result			0
a protestor holds a poster showing @entity4 chancellor @entity100 wearing a head scarf in front of the @entity120 building and the writing ' mrs @entity100 here is the people ' during the @entity18 rally in @entity3 @entity18 owes much of its success to the peculiarities of @entity3 , a city destroyed by the @entity127 in 1945 and since painstakingly restored			1
@entity128 , a politics professor at @entity3 's @entity129 , says @entity3 is less mixed than other cities			2
' there is more xenophobia than in some other cities so there is big potential for mobilising support , ' he said			0
in communist times , @entity3 was known as ' @entity138 ' because western media signals could not be picked up			2
it has a tradition of holding some of @entity68 's biggest neo-nazi marches on feb. 13 to commemorate the firebombing of the city during the final months of @entity144			2
@entity98 estimates 2,000 neo-nazis and right - wing soccer hooligans attend @entity18 rallies , joining ordinary conservatives			1
@entity63 has no intention of weeding out neo-nazis			0
' no one has ' i am a @entity40 , i am a hooligan ' written on their forehead , ' @entity63 said			0
' this is a public event and as the organiser i do n't have the authority to refuse people			0
' added to a traditional conservatism , many people in @entity3 and the surrounding state of @entity162 are disillusioned with politics because the same party -- @entity100 's @entity166 ( @entity167 ) -- has ruled the state since reunification 25 years ago			2
' i 'm not a @entity40 but everyone who enjoys our hospitality must mix in and respect our culture , ' said a sign held by @entity3 resident @entity175 , 45			2
@entity176 is also fed by the city 's low number of immigrants and disproportionately small @entity1 population			1
a poll last week showed that about 70 percent of non-muslim @entity4 in @entity162 feel threatened by @entity1			1
a sharp rise in the number of immigrants and asylum seekers has fuelled a debate in @entity4 , as in other @entity68 countries , with some politicians calling for tighter immigration rules			0
although its asylum laws are among the most liberal in the western world , @entity4 has never become a genuine melting pot of cultures			0
a @entity18 march in @entity195 this week attracted 200 people , although a counter demonstration drew 900			1
next month , the group plans a march in @entity200 .			0
