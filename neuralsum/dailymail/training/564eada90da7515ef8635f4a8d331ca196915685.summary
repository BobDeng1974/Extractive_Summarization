by @entity0 published : 18:11 est , 14 august 2013 updated : 01:49 est , 15 august 2013 @entity2 ’s solicitors yesterday tried to clear themselves of any blame over the spinster ’s bequest to the nation finding its way into party coffers			1
@entity10 solicitors @entity11 initially refused to comment on the case for reasons of ‘ client confidentiality ’ but then produced an ambiguous statement			1
it said : ‘ at the time of the instructions received from the @entity19 , the solicitor specifically checked with miss @entity2 about the unusual nature of her proposed bequest and it was confirmed by @entity19 at the time of her instructions that her estate was to be left to whichever political party formed the government at the date of her death			1
’ @entity31 , partner at @entity32 , the firm which drew up @entity2 's will in 2001 this statement again failed to provide any evidence that miss @entity2 intended to make a generous gift to the @entity37 and @entity38			1
@entity39 , who chairs the @entity41 ’s wills and equity committee , said : ‘ @entity43 are construed extremely tightly and i have now seen a copy of miss @entity2 ’s will			1
it does say quite specifically “ for whichever government ”			0
it does not say “ for which political party shall form the government ”			0
‘ if that ’s what miss @entity2 intended , the solicitors writing the will should have said that			1
’ asked if the verbal clarification secured by the executors trumped what was written down , mr @entity39 said : ‘ no. the will is crystal - clear on the face of it			0
‘ solicitors who prepare wills know perfectly well they have to avoid ambiguity			0
it is regrettable but it appears they did not actually interpret her instructions clearly			0
’ miss @entity2 died last year and had no husband or children			1
her will was drawn up by the @entity72 - based firm run by experienced partners @entity74 and @entity31			2
on tuesday afternoon , after obtaining a copy of the will , the @entity75 rang @entity11 and was put through to mr @entity11			0
he declined to comment , on the basis of ‘ confidentiality ’ , so the @entity75 emailed a series of questions asking who was responsible for interpreting the will as meaning she wanted her money to go to ‘ political parties ’			2
miss @entity2 died last year and had no husband or children mr @entity11 again declined to comment , citing the same professional reason			1
the political parties , on the other hand , had no such qualms			0
by late afternoon , as the buck was being passed frantically around @entity95 , a consensus was emerging that it must surely be all the fault of the executors			0
former midwife @entity2 dedicated her life to public service and then left £ 520,000 as a gift to the nation when she died			1
here is how the government could put her money to use within her beloved @entity104 : sources at the @entity38 and the @entity37 were actively briefing against the small @entity10 firm			1
both parties maintained the first they had heard of @entity2 was when the solicitors phoned up with the welcome news she had left them some money			1
the @entity38 insisted : ‘ the decision to give the money to political parties was taken solely by the executors of the will			2
’ a @entity37 spokesman added : ‘ the solicitors for the deceased informed the @entity118 that it was a beneficiary of the will			2
’ by yesterday morning , heavyweights on all sides of the political spectrum were urging that the money be repaid , and by 11am , the @entity38 and @entity37 had announced they were giving up their windfalls			1
the will was drafted on september 17 , 2001 , without mentioning political parties at all			2
instead , it stated she wanted her money to go to ‘ whichever government is in office at the date of my death for the government in their absolute discretion to use as they may think fit ’			0
@entity136 , a wills specialist at @entity137 , added : ‘ it seems to be very ambiguous and unusual how it was drafted by the solicitor			2
‘ i would not have approached it like this			0
if she gave these instructions , they should have been crystalised in a “ letter of wishes ” , so her executors had proper guidance			0
’ the @entity75 asked @entity11 solicitors whether anything had been put in writing at the time , among a series of further questions yesterday , but has yet to receive a reply .			0

@entity32 drew up @entity2 's will in 2001
