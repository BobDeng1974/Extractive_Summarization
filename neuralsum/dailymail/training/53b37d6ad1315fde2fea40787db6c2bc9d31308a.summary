@entity0 believes that his fellow @entity2 @entity1 will profit from @entity4 ’s anger when the two younger men collide for the second time in @entity6 on saturday night			1
@entity0 , who retired as the undefeated world super-middleweight champion , was the epitome of self - control in the ring			2
@entity1 and @entity4 have moved up from light - heavyweight to cruiser for this re-match but the @entity14 man has been festering with resentment since losing their world title fight			1
@entity1 and @entity4 went head to head on @entity21 's the gloves are off show ahead of their fight @entity1 is keeping cool and is determined to win for the second time against @entity4 @entity4 is fired up for his re-match with rival @entity1 after losing the first bout between the two fighters @entity4 has made no secret of his angst but @entity0 warns : ‘ all this anger is not good for boxers			1
i do n’t know @entity4 very well personally but it looks to me as if the hatred is burning up too much of his energy , ‘ i occasionally did some stuff for the cameras but it was to help sell the promotion , not for real			2
i was always cool , calm and collected in the ring and i believe that is very important			0
you need self - control and discipline in a fight			0
you should keep your emotions in check			0
’ @entity4 has been anything but restrained in the build up and @entity1 says : ‘ it seems he does hate me and really wants to hurt me			1
’ @entity1 and @entity4 almost came to blows back in 2011 ahead of their first fight @entity1 beat @entity4 in their first fight back in 2011 and seemed to show respect to each other afterwards promoter @entity59 reports that @entity4 is more desperate to win this fight than any in his career so far and does not know how he would cope with losing to @entity1			1
although @entity4 is the more natural light - heavy and will be the bigger man on the night , @entity0 does not expect that to be to his advantage either			1
he says : @entity1 was having troubled making the weight at super-middle so although he is moving up his speed will not be affected			0
‘ @entity4 is a good fighter and a heavy puncher – but as we all know speed kills			0
‘ i ’m not only saying this because @entity1 and i are both @entity73 and he is my friend ,			0
i think you will see him relaxed , breathing easily and using his speed and skills to beat @entity4 again			0
‘ yes , @entity4 has home advantage but he had that in the first fight and since the hatred seems genuine the crowd might make him even more likely to go charging in			2
it looks like he ’s got bad blood			0
’ both boxers have been stopped in world title fights since they first met , @entity1 by @entity85 who has just ended the light - heavyweight reign of @entity87 , and @entity4 by @entity88 , but the grudge element in this rematch has caught the imagination of the boxing public in this country , not only will the arena in @entity6 will be packed and roaring for @entity4 but pay - tv sales projections are encouraging			1
