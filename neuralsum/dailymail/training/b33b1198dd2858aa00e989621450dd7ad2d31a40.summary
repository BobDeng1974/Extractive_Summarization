the two - seater f - 18 jet crashed into the @entity11 apartment complex , about a mile from the @entity12 and @entity13 , on friday , after suffering a ' catastrophic mechanical malfunction ' during a training flight			1
the plane plunged into an apartment building , destroying at least three buildings and damaging more than 65 of the housing units - but incredibly no - one was killed			1
as nearby residents rushed to the burning wreckage to try and help , others made calls to the emergency services to ask for rapid response			1
one caller pleads for assistance : ' @entity28 - all those old people			1

one caller says she keeps calling and calling , but no - one has arrived yet - except the pilot , who is sitting on her porch			2
she says : ' there 's no - one here , there 's the pilot waiting on my patio			2
' ' the pilot is on your patio ? ' , the operator replies , with a quick double - take			2
' yes and no - one 's here and i keep calling and calling and there 's no - one answering			2
' the pilots ejected from the plane and are credited with saving lives by dumping their fuel seconds before impact			1
concerns : there are no known fatalities from the dramatic crash , but three elderly residents who lived in the apartment block are unaccounted for wrecked : an aerial view of the apartments shows the roofs of several buildings completely destroyed as the plane still burns , the 911 operators deal with more and more calls for assistance			1
as one caller complains how long it takes to get through , the 911 operator responds : ' @entity107 , we 've got 47 calls in the queue to be answered			1
' another caller witnessed the plane as it struggled to keep control			0
he told the operator : ' a @entity3 plane just went down on 24th street			1
