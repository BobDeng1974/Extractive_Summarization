there 's not much ex-marine , natural historian and presenter @entity3 wo n't do in the name of adventure			1
' at one point i was sleeping in a coffin - shaped , scorpion - filled cavity 500 feet up a limestone cliff face , ' he tells @entity10			2
his new series , @entity12 , charts his escapades with explorer , survival expert and pioneering climber @entity16 to some of the world 's furthest flung corners			1
their aim ? to seek out places mankind has never set food , to find out if the age of exploration is really over			2
in two sneak preview videos , we see the pair gearing up to sleep 500 feet above the ground in hammocks hoisted up into the canopy of the @entity40 rainforest			1
' i was so far out of my comfort zone , ' says @entity3 , a marine biologist			1
' i love sea level and below , so it was nerve - racking for me			2
' ' but i was in safe hands			2
@entity16 is one of the best climbers in the world			1
' the adventurers spent the night sleeping on a tiny platform 500ft above the @entity40 rainforest , which @entity51 admits took him right out of his comfort zone - and forced him to retreat into a cave the two explorers were flown straight in to the remote jungle in @entity22 , and even tried to scale a vertical rockface by a waterfall the duo also over-nighted on a ledge the size of a kitchen table half way up the @entity66 gorge , in @entity24 , which was particularly challenging for @entity51 , who suffers from vertigo			1
' @entity16 is fine with heights , so he slept on his hammock over the cliff edge , while i crawled into a tiny coffin - shaped cave			1
' once i got in , i noticed lots of little burrows all around me , so i decided to have a look with my endoscope			0
there were scorpions all around me			1
' ' i did n't sleep well that night , and i woke up to something crawling over my face			0
' @entity3 , right , was joined by @entity16 , left , one of the world 's best climbers , having scaled the notorious @entity85 in @entity86 , at 18 he describes the adventure as an exercise in fear management - arachnophobia , claustrophobia , vertigo			1
you name it , they did it			0
@entity51 continues : ' we had once incident where one of the porters cut his foot with a machete			0
we were out in the middle of nowhere , and our medic had to strap him up			0
' he could have lost a lot of blood , so he had to be carried out of the rainforest and helicoptered to safety			0
' you are always tip - toeing on the edge of calamity with these things			0
' the pair took a two - day trek to the @entity23 in @entity24			1
@entity51 says if they had lost their guides in the endless underground maze of caves , they 'd have never got out			0
the daring pair encountered a huge variety of wildlife from the seemingly harmless to the utterly terrifying ' the floor was a jumble of boulders and crags and ravines			1
we were squeezing through tiny little gaps			0
we fell over a lot , if we had broken a leg or something it would have taken weeks to get you out			0
we were squeezing through tiny little gaps			0
more people have stood on the moon than have been here			0
' no wonder the star refers to it as ' the most adventurous serious i 've ever made '			0
the idea behind the series was to see if genuine exploration still exists			2
are there still areas of the world so remote that just a handful of people can reach them ? throughout 2014 @entity144 and @entity51 put t to the test , making extraordinary expeditions in @entity148 and @entity24 where they discovered new species , found legendary geographic features , and became the first people to measure two supposedly mythical waterfalls			2
the two also descended into the @entity23 in @entity24 , one of the longest networks of caves in the world even descending into complete darkness , in areas where so few humans have stepped , the duo came across wildlife @entity3 ( left ) served in the @entity163 , while @entity16 ( right ) is one of the best climbers in the world the duo teamed up to combine @entity168 ' remarkable climbing ability with @entity51 â€™ past as a @entity163 and his present role as a biologist			1
they managed to ascend a new route up the 1,000ft @entity174 , as well as pushing deep into the @entity175 , pushing themselves to the limit			0
so , having reached parts of the world barely touched before and even discovered new species , is there still more to see ? @entity3 explains : ' the world has many places left to explore			1
we 've explored 5 per cent of the deep sea			0
man knows nothing about @entity188 only 30 per cent of our cave systems have been explored			2
' lost worlds with @entity3 and @entity16 airs for four weeks from friday february 13 at 9pm on the @entity191 .			1
