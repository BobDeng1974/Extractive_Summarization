by @entity0 published : 03:26 est , 30 august 2013 updated : 05:59 est , 30 august 2013 left waiting : half of all services operated by @entity3 on the @entity4 were late one in three trains in @entity7 is late and on some routes more than half fail to arrive on time , ' real ' official figures revealed today			1
rail companies do not consider their services as delayed as long as they arrived no more than 10 minutes behind schedule			1
but @entity14 has produced new ' right - time ' statistics , which look at delays of more than 59 seconds			1
the results have today been called ' shocking ' and a ' national scandal '			0
it found 47.4 per cent of services operated by @entity3 on the @entity4 were on time in the past year			1
the figures for this 12 - month period also showed that only 45.2 per of trains on the serpentine @entity24 service , from @entity25 to @entity26 , were on time			0
the best was @entity28 , with an 87.5 per cent punctuality record			0
overall 67.6 per cent of all trains nationally were on time			0
this means that services have deteriorated as in 2011 the rate was 69.8 per cent			2
‘ passengers tell us that punctual trains are what they want most from the railway – so they will be disappointed with the decline in overall performance , ' @entity41 , from the rail watchdog @entity43 , said			2
‘ passenger satisfaction with punctuality has also gone down in our latest passenger survey			0
it is essential that this is reversed so that passengers can get back to depending on the railway			0
’ @entity53 and south east @entity52 train operators ' punctuality reached 68.5 per cent but the figure for long - distance services was only 53.2 per cent			0
@entity14 publishes the right - time performance alongside the the public performance measure ( @entity59 ) figures under which the company 's punctuality record is assessed by the @entity62 ( @entity62 )			1
under @entity59 , a short - distance train is only deemed to be late if it arrives five minutes or more after the scheduled time , while a long - distance train has to arrive 10 minutes or more behind schedule to be considered late			2
under @entity59 , 90.8 % of trains were on time nationally for the 12 months ending august 18 2013			0
@entity3 had the poorest punctuality figure - 83.1 per cent @entity14 says that as far as the right - time figures are concerned ' the process for gathering data of this accuracy is currently not 100 per cent reliable and the industry is working on improving the quality of this information to make right - time data more reliable '			1
nationally , around 60 per cent of delays to train services are attributed to @entity14 , which has been repeatedly warned by the @entity62 about its punctuality performance			1
' shocking ' : real time figures show that more than half of all trains run late on some rail routes @entity3 has been at loggerheads with @entity14 over @entity4 delays , with @entity3 upset that its request to run more services on the line has been turned down			1
@entity89 , general secretary of the @entity91 transport union , said : ' these shocking figures show that under privatisation the @entity7 people are paying the highest fares in @entity96 to travel on some of the most unreliable services			2
' it is a national scandal that profits and bonuses are being bled out of the rail system while services and capacity are collapsing into chaos			0

@entity14 has counted all trains that were more than 59 secs late
@entity3 's @entity4 *franchise* only had 47 % punctuality rate
average of *33* % of trains on all @entity7 's routes were late or delayed
