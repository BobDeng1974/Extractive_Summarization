he said : ' he was a paedophile preying on young girls , yet he was only locked up for two years			0
what does he have to be compensated for ? ' the worst of it is that as taxpayers , me and her mother are paying for him to go through the court system and then we ’ll end up contributing through our taxes to any compensation he gets – the man who did this to our girl			1
' @entity82 mp @entity81 added : ‘ i take the very simple view that if someone comes to this country and then breaks the law then he should be sent back to where he comes from			0
' any arguments about his human rights disappear when he has violated , violently , the rights of a young girl			2
’ @entity13 arrived in the @entity11 in november 2004 hidden in the back of a lorry			1

the judge , sitting at the @entity133 in @entity134 , accepted that @entity13 was a member of the @entity27 and so it was ‘ not possible ’ to return him to @entity22			2
but he ruled there was no evidence of @entity13 being held unlawfully or unreasonably at any time and his case failed ‘ on all grounds ’			2
the judge said : ‘ it was deliberate , targeted abuse of a young and vulnerable girl			2
the risk that the claimant , in his early - 20s , would commit a further sexual offence if released … had to be considered as substantial			0
