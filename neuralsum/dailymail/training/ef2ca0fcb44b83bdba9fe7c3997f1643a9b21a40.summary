stand : crown chief prosecutor for the north west @entity2 , pictured , has admitted the exploitation of white girls is an ' @entity6 problem ' the sexual exploitation and grooming of young vulnerable white girls is a ' particular problem in @entity6 communities ' , one of @entity9 's top prosecutors admitted for the first time today			1
in a year when several paedophile gangs were convicted of raping and prostituting victims in north west @entity19 , @entity2 says it is impossible not to notice ' that the perpetrators were @entity6 and the victims were not			1
' the chief crown prosecutor for the region added that ' cultural baggage and the status of women among some men in these communities contributes to their disrespect for the rights of women			2
' it was claimed last month that fears they would be branded racist meant that police and social services left one group free to rape up to 50 white girls , and mr @entity2 said today he would not ' turn a blind eye			1
' it came as the @entity43 announced yesterday a day of evidence next week because its members and chairman @entity46 are ' very concerned by the recent cases of child exploitation			1
' the @entity50 mp for @entity51 has previously said : ' i do not think it is a race issue			1
' in these disturbing recent cases most victims were white , aged between 13 and 16 , many were from vulnerable backgrounds or the care system , and the majority were plied with booze and drugs before being systematically abused			1
speaking to the @entity62 today mr @entity2 said : ' exploitation happens in every community but these cases demonstrate that group grooming is a particular problem in @entity6 community			1
i will not turn a blind eye to crimes in any community			2
' he spoke out as two @entity6 men , @entity74 and @entity75 , were convicted of raping or sexually assaulting four young white women in their area after they picked them up and got them drunk			1
in an originally botched prosecution in 2009 , victims gave detailed evidence about being violently raped by @entity74 before charges were dropped because evidence was said to lack credibility			1
once the case was abandoned , @entity74 was free to target a 17 - year - old from a nearby children 's home , plying her with vodka before sexually assaulting her at his flat			1
his other victims were also violently raped or assaulted while very drunk			1
disgusting in the @entity93 case the abuse began at two takeaways in the @entity97 area , including the @entity98 ( pictured ) , which is under new ownership and when he was finally arrested and charged with rape again last year individuals close to the case said @entity74 told officers : ' rape ? which one ? ' while last month a sex grooming gang of nine were all jailed , and two set to be deported , after they plied teenagers with alcohol before abusing them in @entity93 , @entity109			1
the men - who are all from @entity111 , apart from one who is from @entity113 - groomed and ' shared ' the young white girls because they were vulnerable , and abused them above takeaways and shops			1
but during the trial it came out that the authorities could have stopped them two years before their sickening crimes were finally uncovered			2
in an interview with @entity122 last month @entity50 mp for @entity125 @entity124 , who has campaigned on the issue of @entity6 sex gangs and also preventing forced marriage , said that the authorities did ignore complaints in this case because they were ' petrified of being called racist '			1
' forces have been accused of being institutionally racist			0
that sort of thing sticks , ' she added			0
' if you do say things like that about any police force then they will be majorly careful to avoid being being put in line for criticism like that			0
it may well be that they then steer clear of the tragic events that we are talking about			0
all because they want to be politically correct			0
' trophy : victim @entity150 was initially flattered by the attention she received from @entity153 but was then kept prisoner by them pretty teenager @entity150 thought she ’d found the perfect boyfriend			0
polite , handsome , and seven years her senior , he drove a silver @entity158 , wore designer suits and bought her dinner at her favourite pizza café			0
no wonder her schoolfriends were envious			0
and when he asked her to marry him , she started to make plans for their future			0
yet @entity150 eventually learned the truth about @entity153			0
while they were going out , the @entity9 - born man of @entity111 origin was orchestrating what is believed to be the biggest sex - abuse ring ever discovered in @entity9 , involving up to 100 young girls			1
last year , @entity153 and his accomplice , @entity153 , whose @entity174 - based gang groomed girls ( most of whom were white and aged between 12 and 18 ) for sex , were jailed for bringing a ‘ reign of terror ’ to the @entity178 city			1
a court heard how the pair — who had undergone arranged marriages in @entity111 — cruised the streets in a @entity158 or a @entity185 , which @entity153 referred to as the ‘ @entity186 ’			0
girls were ‘ chatted up ’ on the street and invited for drives , during which they were plied with vodka or cocaine before being taken to hotel rooms , parks or houses to be abused			2
@entity196 to the men ’s conviction was @entity150 , now 20 , who bravely gave evidence against her ex-lover			2
‘ when i discovered what he had done to those girls , i felt physically sick			2
he was the puppet master and all his mates were his puppets			0
everyone did whatever he told them to do , ' she said			0
‘ i was a white girl who he wanted to control and prove that he could convert to @entity206			2
i saw him and the gang tell @entity209 girls they were “ slags ”			2
i believe it was the religion and culture of these men that made them act like that			0
‘ in one of the last conversations i had with him , he referred to his @entity218 as the “ @entity186 ”			0
that is when i knew i had to escape			0

after a spate of cases @entity2 says it is impossible not to notice ' that the perpetrators were @entity6 and the victims were not '
in the last year several gangs have been prosecuted for targeting young , vulnerable white girls and abusing them
