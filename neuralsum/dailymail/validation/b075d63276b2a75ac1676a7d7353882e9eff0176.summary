a dominatrix based in @entity1 is challenging a new law in @entity3 that will make it illegal to pay for sex			1
@entity6 , 37 , believes the legislation will put women 's lives in danger by driving prostitution underground			1
in response , she 's assembled a ' crack team ' of legal experts to fight the legislation all the way to the @entity17			2
for the past 18 years , @entity6 has earned her living as a sex worker , travelling between @entity1 and @entity3 and juggling the job with motherhood , studying and activism			1
@entity6 , 37 , has worked in the sex industry for 18 years and believes new legislation will put lives in danger ' the work i do is very diverse , ' @entity6 said			1
' i 'm a dominatrix , i provide a " girlfriend experience " and i also work with the disabled and terminally ill. ' @entity6 says her clients fall into three categories			2
' the first group are what i call my @entity37 bunnies , ' she said			0
' these are the young guys who watch a lot of porn and think that good sex is just how long you can pound away for , which of course it 's not			2
they can be difficult to deal with but they 're good fun			0
' i see a lot of guys in their 50s who got married at 20 and found the sex died off			2
it can be because they drifted apart from their wife but , in some cases , it 's sadder ; the wife may have developed a degenerative condition like @entity57 's or @entity58 or @entity59 's			2
' sometimes it 's on their conscience for a long time before they contact me but they 've come to the conclusion that it 's better for everybody			0
@entity6 says her clients fall into three categories - including ' @entity68 ' who ' pound away ' until june 1 , laws governing prostitution in @entity3 remain similar to the rest of the @entity73 and the @entity74			1
this means that prostitution itself is legal , but most activities associated with it ( such as soliciting in a public place or running a brothel ) are illegal			0
once the @entity83 comes into force , it will be illegal for consenting adults to pay for sex in @entity3			1
' the third category are my older guys			0
they 're usually widows , terribly lonely , and they just want cuddles and company more than anything else			0
' @entity6 is careful when choosing her clients , ensuring that she 's safe and that men are clear about what the session will involve , especially when they 're booking her as a dominatrix			1
' i get a good grasp before - hand of what they 're expecting , ' she said			0
' we pretty much agree a scenario but part of my job as a dominatrix is encouraging people to push their boundaries			0
this could be through things like spanking , caning , cross-dressing or role play			0
' at the moment , transactions like this between @entity6 and her @entity3 clients are legal			1
however , from june 1 , a new law will mean that men who pay @entity6 for sex could be arrested			1
the legislation is being championed by @entity122 peer @entity120			0
it will make @entity3 the first region in the @entity73 to ban payment for sex between consenting adults			1
@entity6 says she is a dominatrix providing a ' girlfriend experience ' the so - called ' @entity131 model ' – which makes it illegal to buy sex , but not to sell it – has been heavily criticised by groups including the @entity135 and @entity136			1
they say there 's no evidence it works and that , instead , it causes real harm to women			2
police in @entity3 are not backing the legislation and the justice minister , @entity146 , has said to will be hard to enforce			1
importantly , a @entity147 commissioned survey revealed that 98 per cent of sex workers are opposed to the law			0
' even women who 've suffered terribly within the trade agreed that sometimes what 's needed is refuge and rehab not the criminalisation of clients , ' @entity6 said			1
the law is being brought in as a solution to sex trafficking , although the @entity147 report suggested that less than 1 percent of those involved in the sex trade had been forced into it			2
last year , there were no recorded incidents of sex trafficking in @entity3 but there were 70 recorded incidences of violence against sex workers			1
@entity6 is worried this violence is about to increase as women are forced to work in more isolated areas and clients refuse to give out personal details over fear of arrest			1
the main fear is of an increase in violence and vulnerability as women are forced to work in more isolated areas and clients refuse to give out personal details over fear of arrest ' @entity120 has effectively said that he really could n't care less about the welfare of sex workers , ' she said			2
once the law comes in , the crusading dominatrix and her team of expert lawyers will take their case first to @entity3 's @entity194 and finally to the @entity196 court of human rights			1
the team will challenge the legislation on several articles			0
they are hoping to prove that @entity120 's law contravenes the @entity203 , including the rights to privacy , health and protection from degrading treatment			0
the law may even flout the human right to life			0
if prostitution becomes more hidden and dangerous , @entity6 has no doubt that deaths will follow			2
' sex workers are going to suffer , ' she said			0
' i witnessed the effects of the 1993 legislation when i was working in @entity219			0
as soon as legislation came in making it an offence to solicit , violence against sex workers skyrocketed and it was n't too long before [ 21 - year - old sex worker ] @entity226 was stabbed to death by a client			1
' last year , a similar law was proposed in the @entity73 by mp @entity231			0
but after a campaign by the @entity236 ( @entity237 ) , the @entity233 and the @entity234 the bill was dropped without even going to a vote			0
@entity239 of the @entity237 said they are behind @entity6 's fight in @entity3			1
' internationally , sex workers are challenging discriminatory prostitution laws which force us to work in isolation and increased danger , ' she said			2
' legal challenges , spearheaded by sex workers , are a vital tool in our armoury to win justice and protection			0

@entity6 , 37 , travels between @entity1 and @entity3 as a sex worker
it means that from june 1 , men who pay for sex could be arrested
