it is a debate that has raged since @entity1 became one of the most successful films of all time : did @entity5 leave @entity6 to die by not letting him up on the makeshift lifeboat as they floated in the ocean ? and now a @entity11 television show has carried out a series of tests that show @entity15 's character could have survived the disaster had he lifted himself onto the raft from which @entity5 , played by @entity18 , was plucked			1
the @entity20 's mythbusters recreated the treacherous conditions after the @entity1 sank in 1912 and , through hypothermia tests , discovered @entity6 would have survived the freezing conditions if he had climbed out			1
in the dramatic climax to the @entity43 - winning epic , @entity6 dies from hypothermia while @entity5 is rescued			1
titanic director @entity45 told @entity19 he believed the wooden life raft would not have supported both @entity6 and @entity5			1
but the team found that if @entity5 had taken off her lifejacket and put it under the raft it would have given them enough buoyancy to keep both of them afloat			2
reconstruction : mythbusters , left , replicate the events from the blockbuster film @entity1 , right happier ending ? : the @entity19 set out to see if @entity6 , played by @entity15 need not have sacrificed himself to save @entity18 's character , @entity5 discovery : the @entity19 found that both @entity18 and @entity15 's characters could have fitted on the makeshift raft and survived the sinking hosts @entity63 and @entity65 then carried out a hypothermia test to see what would happen if @entity15 's character had indeed climbed out of the water and onto the wooden door			1
a dummy with gelatin flesh and a water - heated copper cardiovascular system that was rigged to monitor body temperature was used to simulate @entity15 ’s character			0
the dummy ’s body temp was set at 98.6 ° and dressed in wet clothes			0
it was then set hovering above the freezing water in 29 ° f air as if he were lying on the wooden raft			0
the show found that as long as he was rescued before his body temperature dropped below 82 ° f , he could be revived			0
after an hour on the raft they found the dummy ’s core body temp was 82.5 ° f meaning @entity6 would have lived had he got out of the water			2
conclusions : mythbusters @entity65 , left , and @entity63 , centre , reveal their findings to titanic director @entity45 , right , romantic : @entity15 pictured as @entity1 , with @entity18 is @entity1 , in a scene from the film written and directed by @entity45 in the film @entity5 was one of the last to be rescued			1
historical documents show that fifth officer @entity99 , who was depicted rescuing @entity5 , looked for survivors 45 minutes			2
in a separate test the ' @entity101 found that had @entity6 remained in the water for over an hour he would have died from hypothermia			0
@entity45 , however , had the last word telling the tv show that @entity6 had to die as that ’s what the script called for			1
he said : ' i think you guys are missing the point @entity114 script says @entity6 died			0
so maybe we screwed up and the board should have been a little tiny bit smaller , but the dude 's goin ' down			0
' see below for videos			0
