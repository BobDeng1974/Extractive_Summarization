@entity0 believes that @entity1 can round off their first five months working together by regaining his place in the much - vaunted @entity4 by the end of next week			1
the 27 - year - old @entity6 can make the jump from his current position of number six if he enjoys success at the @entity11 that begins on sunday , and @entity0 he is in the form to do it			1
' he could aim for the win there			2
i think for him the important thing is going to be to try to finish the year at @entity17			1
there is a possibility of that , ' she said as @entity1 stepped his preparations at @entity24 's @entity23			1
@entity1 returns the ball to @entity26 during the @entity27 world tour masters quarter - finals in @entity28 @entity29 is 420 points ahead of @entity1 at four while @entity31 is 150 points above			1
the long and short is that the @entity34 player may have to win at least two matches although one might do , depending on how the @entity37 and the @entity38 fare			2
' @entity1 has won many matches , beating top 10 players again , which he had n't been doing for a while , though he did beat @entity43 ( @entity44 ) at the @entity45 , ' she said			1
that was another step i wanted him to feel			2
the other step was to win tournaments			2
i wanted him to feel what it was like to finish the week without losing			1
' obviously he 's a little bit tired , but he 's also in great confidence			2
maybe it balances that tiredness a little bit			2
but we 're looking forward to the end of the tournament here and @entity24 , to maybe start 2015 in a better position			1
' @entity0 has backed @entity1 to make a return to the top four sooner rather than later @entity0 is also anticipating the window they will have together in the off - season , and it sounds like developing his undoubted volleying skills and using them more regularly at the net will be on the agenda			1
' i think he has the ability to do it probably a little more often than he does			2
it 's not an easy process			0
i think it 's also not a fast one			0
i think we 're both looking towards that			0
' you ca n't do everything at once			0
he needed some confidence back			1
he needed many things before getting to this part of the work			0
really other priorities were there before this specific area of his game			0
' ' when you 're like @entity1 and you can do many different things , you have to choose the right shot at the right time			1
and that 's not easy to do			0
he 's trying to have perfect shot selection but it 's not easy			0
' @entity1 's appointment of a female as coach , first revealed by @entity101 , has been one of the season 's main talking points and the former women 's number one is delighted how they have gelled on a personal basis			1
@entity1 came up short against @entity26 but will be hoping to go all the way in @entity24 next week ' we 're getting on well together			1
personally i would n't be able to work with a man or a woman player without having a good connection , a good feel for each other			0
it does n't happen immediately			0
i 'm not the type of person who opens up that easily , he also			0
it took a bit of time , but the relationship is good			0
it 's something that is good for both of us , i would say			0
' she admits that a reluctance to travel was almost a stumbling block to their arrangement , but she is ready to commit to half the year on the road with him			1
' the down part for me , as i see it , is definitely the travelling , but i accept it and i 'm ready to do it , as long as he wants me to and as long as i also want to do it			0
' it has also helped that gets on well with his other coach @entity141 plus the physios and coaches that make up the team			1
the big test for her relationship with @entity1 is likely to come next year , but she feels he is in good shape to train on after his recent tear through @entity152 and @entity153 that qualified him for @entity24			1
the @entity6 will be looking to be back and among the most elite players ranked in the world , like @entity156 ' it would be hard not to be pleased with that , ' she said			1
' after @entity160 he was not in a great position to enter the @entity162			0
it was decided that he was going to go for it , have a few weeks in a row , we were not sure exactly how many and a lot would depend on the results he had in @entity152			0
' then it was pretty clear he had to do the six weeks in a row , he did great and all the credit to him fighting like crazy and physically holding up well			0
' his body and his back , there was a question mark there , all the work that has been done as recovery part of the plan was great			2
he should be proud of the last part of the season , he has been winning a lot of matches it gives him quite a lot of confidence			0

@entity1 is currently ranked no 6 in the world
however if he is successful at the @entity11 he will climb back into the top four as a result
his coach @entity0 has backed him to break back into the elite string of players on the circuit
the 27 - year - old is *competing* in @entity24 next week
