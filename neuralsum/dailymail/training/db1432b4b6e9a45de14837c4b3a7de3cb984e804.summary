by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity2 : 05:59 est , 27 december 2013 @entity3 : 09:58 est , 28 december 2013 hundreds of soldiers attended the funeral of @entity6 today to pay their final respects to the designer of the assault rifle that has killed more people than any other firearm in the world			1
@entity6 , who created the @entity13 more than 60 years ago , died in hospital on monday at the age of 94			1
he was today buried with full state honours at the @entity18 ( @entity19 ) - a newly opened cemetery for national heroes - in @entity22 outside @entity23 , the defence ministry said			0
@entity6 died in hospital his home city of @entity52 , near the @entity53 - where his gun is still made			1
he had been ill for some time and had been in intensive care since november 17			0
@entity6 , a @entity27 peasant with little formal education , designed the eponymous rifle in 1947 - with the letters @entity13 referring to ' @entity61 ' ( @entity13 ) and the year of its release			1

there is one @entity13 for every 70 people in the world , the deadliest weapon ever created @entity45 hero : @entity6 in 1949 , two years after the weapon he invented went into mass production legacy of death : @entity6 celebrating the 50th anniversary of his weapon in 1997 ( left ) with a t - shirt listing some of the conflicts in which it was intrumental			1
right , at his home near the town where it is still made honoured : he met president @entity32 just three months ago			2
mr @entity32 expressed his ' deep condolences ' but the rifle and its variants soon became the weapons of choice for dozens of armies and guerrilla groups around the world			0
specifically engineered to work in the harsh conditions in which @entity45 troops operated , it became one of the most successful weapons ever produced and turned its inventor into one of the most lauded men in the @entity45			1
cheap , efficient and easily mass - produced , the gun soon became synonymous with killing on a sometimes indiscriminate scale			1
it was taken up by militants as far afield as @entity119 , @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity123 , @entity124 and @entity125 , to name a few			0
@entity126 was infamously pictured clutching the deadly weapon			0
militants : @entity126 was pictured with the weapon including in this photo in june 2001 conflict : a @entity133 rebel fighter as she heard @entity135 's forces had been driven out of @entity136 in 2011 in the @entity139 ( pictured ) @entity138 troops reportedly threw away their m - 16s and took @entity142 ak - 47s conflict : a @entity145 worker armed with an @entity13 during the war in @entity147 in july 1998 , in which thousands died widespread : young rebels in @entity122 hold an @entity13 during the conflict with the president @entity151 in 2003 @entity152 , son of the former president of @entity124 , in 1997 when martial law was declared in the nation lethal tipple : a man holding alcohol and shooting an @entity13 in the air in @entity161 in march 1997 , when 1,000 protesters gathered to respond to rumours the embattled then - president , @entity163 , had resigned invading @entity138 troops reportedly found a gold - plated @entity6 in one of the palaces of @entity167 , left			1

the weapon , named for its inventor and the year when it was created , was never patented in @entity190 so was widely copied the @entity13 's story truly began in 1942 , when @entity45 soldiers siezed new - style automatic rifles from @entity195 troops			1
unlike traditional or semi-automatic rifles , they could fire a whole magazine of bullets simply by holding down the trigger , because the recoil from each shot ejected the previous cartridge			0
entrenched in the conflict of the @entity205 , the @entity45 set to work straight away on copying the @entity207 ' designs			1
but their first versions were clunky , weighing more than 5kg without bullets , and the task of creating a new design fell to @entity6 , who had created an unsuccessful gun prototype earlier in the war			1
his design mashed together the best elements of previous weapons and won a competition in 1946 , going into full production the next year			2
accuracy was not its strongest point but it endured for its simplicity and reliability in even the harshest of conditions - built , as it was , in the wilds of @entity226			0
it was not patented - opening the door for millions of ' pirate ' versions - because of the culture which existed in the communist state			0
all ideas were property of the government , not one individual person , and pride came from helping the great @entity45 army			2
source : @entity239 there are an estimated 100 million kalashnikovs , one for every 70 people in the world			1
the gun is in official service in 55 countries and adorns the flag of @entity248			0
its vast popularity was partly down to the fact its design was never patented , so it was widely ripped off			0
this was accelerated by the @entity45 's policy of allowing friendly countries to imitate its designs of weaponry to strengthen its position during the @entity259			2
the @entity6 was prized for its sturdy reliability in difficult conditions			2
during the @entity265 war @entity138 soldiers reportedly threw away their m - 16s in the harsh jungle and took every @entity13 they could find			2
the 205 - year - old @entity269 factory , which makes the weapon and is seen by @entity27 as a national icon , always complained that its potential income was hit badly by the ' pirated ' versions of the designs made abroad			1
but @entity269 has also suffered from dwindling demand and a failure to make up for this with foreign orders - a problem plaguing many specialised @entity280 industries			0
@entity27 president @entity32 , who met mr @entity6 just three months ago , expressed his ' deep condolences ' over his death			1
born in a @entity226 village as the 17th child of his family on november 10 , 1919 , mr @entity6 had a tragic childhood during which his father was deported under @entity45 dictator @entity288 in 1930			1
in october 1941 he was heavily wounded and shell - shocked in a @entity45 defeat by the @entity195			2
he reportedly first conceived of the weapon while recovering in hospital			0
despite the lethal legacy of his weapon , @entity190 lavished mr @entity6 with honours including the prestigious @entity190 prize , the nation 's highest honour , for designing the iconic rifle			2
in 2007 , president @entity32 praised him , saying ' the kalashnikov rifle is a symbol of the creative genius of our people			0
' the inventor had said he had never intended for it to become the world 's most popular weapon , and he fell into making it by accident			1
instead he had wanted to design farm equipment ' such as a lawnmower ' , he claimed			1
yet he carried on working as the chief designer at @entity269 well into his 80s			0
he profited little from his gun , and almost not at all before the collapse of the @entity45 in 1991			2
because of the lack of patent laws he was , like the inventors of more harmless global successes like @entity321 , merely a state employee			0
' i created a weapon to defend the fatherland 's borders , ' he said during an award ceremony at the @entity327 to mark his 90th birthday			2
fame : despite the advent of hundreds of other guns , the @entity13 by @entity6 ( pictured with his designs ) led the pack for its hard - wearing simplicity and the ease with which it could be copied the former @entity226 peasant , pictured in 2002 , continued working as a leading gun designer well into his 80s celebration : the ageing inventor had a complex legacy but was honoured as a @entity27 hero indirectly , @entity6 leaves a bloody legacy			1
he claimed he would rather have invented a lawnmower ' it 's not my fault that it was sometimes used where it should n't have been			0
this is the fault of politicians			0
' on another occasion he said : ' after the collapse of the great and mighty @entity45 so much c * * p has been imposed on us , especially on the younger generation			2
i wrote six books to help them find their way in life			0
' there is a bronze bust of him in his native village of @entity366 in the @entity226 region of @entity368 - and it is a local tradition for newlyweds to lay flowers there			0
' they whisper " @entity374 , wish us happiness and healthy kids , " he once said			0
" what other gun designer can boast of that ? " ' dangerous : kalashnikovs in @entity121			0

former @entity27 peasant designed the @entity13 after the @entity205
popular with militants , the gun is still made in his home city of @entity52
its low price and wide production made it synonymous with mass killing
inventor *insisted* he created it to ' defend the fatherland ' of @entity45
he never wanted to design guns and would rather have built a lawnmower
there is one @entity6 for every 70 people in the world
