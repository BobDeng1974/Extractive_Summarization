by @entity0 on his first return to these shores since his amazing double of @entity5 and @entity7 titles last july , @entity1 would be fully entitled to look in his rear - view mirror with a self - indulgent smile			1
there , this veritable golfing pied piper would see not only @entity12 but @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15			1
from his own country he would spot @entity17 plus 2014 @entity20 winners @entity18 and @entity21			0
there ’s @entity23 , no 2 in the standings for @entity27 ’s @entity26 team			2
‘ @entity1 set the standard and put ideas in all of our heads , ’ agreed @entity17			2
dressed in navy shorts and a crisp white shirt , the man in question bounces into a room set aside at a recent @entity20 event to talk links golf , and particularly his own evolution from out - of - his - depth malcontent to arch - exponent of this venerable form of the game			1
but first , his outstanding role in the transformation of the @entity5 from the worst field in its history to the best			2
that must give him enormous pleasure ? ‘ it always seemed a common sense thing to me to come over a few days early and get acclimatised , and particularly if you live in the @entity73 , ’ said @entity1 , who first played in the @entity5 in 1992 and has only missed two editions since 2003			1
‘ it made even more sense when they moved it from @entity77 to links courses			0
my short game was so sharp during the @entity5 at @entity80 last year and a lot of that was due to the fact we had spent a week playing at @entity85			1
‘ it gave me a lot of time to work on the different shots you need in firm conditions			0
’ @entity92 prepare for @entity5 challenge trail blazer : the @entity5 champion 's decision to play is @entity97 last year has been followed by others young pretenders : @entity12 and @entity13 will be honing their skills at the @entity5 @entity1 ’s first experiences of links golf were actually quite encouraging			1
in 1991 he made the cut as an amateur on his @entity5 debut at @entity106 before scoring three points out of four for @entity27 at the @entity108 at @entity109			1
‘ that year i had @entity111 ’s old caddie , @entity110 , on the bag at @entity106 and he said to me there was no doubt i would win an open championship one day , ’ recalled @entity1			1
‘ but as the years passed , i was n’t so sure he was right			0
it was a much longer process than i ever imagined to get my game to accommodate links golf and there were times when i wondered whether i would ever manage it			1
‘ because i had been brought up to fly the ball through the air i just got more upset with the crazy bounces and the cross winds			0
crazy bounces and crosswinds : @entity1 sometimes wondered if he would ever be able to master links golf the @entity131 winner of the @entity5 had never gone on to win the @entity5 , but last year @entity1 did the double			1
he claimed his first @entity134 event after a play - off at @entity85 and won by three strokes at @entity80			2
the @entity137 started the last round of the @entity139 on level par. he charged to six under at @entity141 and shared the lead but finished second after four bogeys in six holes on the back @entity146 month after coming second at the @entity147 in 1999 , @entity1 was world no 10 and hotly tipped to do well at the @entity5			1
but rounds of 79 and 76 at @entity150 meant he missed the cut			0
@entity152 ‘ once i realised the idea was to get the ball on the ground and let it affect the ball more than the air and the wind it became more manageable			0
but there ’s no question it took me quite a while to really appreciate the greatness of the challenge			0
’ a breakthrough of sorts came at @entity168 in 2004 , when he started working with short - game guru @entity169			0
‘ that was a real turning point for me , where we worked on shots to keep the ball down , and i ended up finishing third there , and missing out on the play - off by one shot , ’ he said			2
nevertheless , it would be another seven years before he would get in contention again			0
in the wind and rain at @entity181 ’s , @entity1 put together a front - nine charge in the final round , before running out of steam as the trophy went to @entity186			1
so to last year , and @entity85			0
after @entity1 finished runner - up for the sixth time at the @entity147 the previous month we had a final day on the coast where he would n’t have had a prayer at one time , as the gusts reached 30mph			2
breakthrough : @entity1 finally got to grips with @entity7 after coming third at @entity168 in 2004 @entity1 made it exciting by taking four on the last hole when a three would have won him his first title in @entity199			1
but an exquisite chip decided the subsequent play - off against @entity203 @entity202			2
‘ no - one likes a predictable movie now , do they ? ’ he told an adoring @entity97 audience			2
a win the week before a major is usually a kiss of death for a player ’s chances at the big one , but @entity1 is no ordinary golfer			1
he once won the week before the masters and then the green jacket itself , so had no fears he had peaked too early			0
just the opposite , in fact			0
the @entity5 trophy was all the evidence he needed he could play links golf at the highest level			1
‘ the win gave me so much momentum heading into the @entity5 , ’ recalled the 44 - year - old			1
‘ i felt like i had all the tools at my disposal to do well at @entity80			0
i had shown to myself i could play links golf in a decent wind and score well			1
that win gave me an awful lot of satisfaction			0
’ comeback : @entity1 came from behind to beat @entity15 to the title at @entity80 last season sealed with a kiss : the @entity27 golfer celebrates realising his @entity5 dream with his family in @entity241 not as much , however , as the one a week later			1
trailing @entity15 by five , @entity1 not only caught him but beat him by four strokes with a final round that sits alongside the finest in the tournament ’s long and illustrious history			2
no wonder he looks back on that fortnight as among the most satisfying of his career , and the @entity249 has been with him everywhere on his travels			2
back home in @entity254 when friends come over for dinner he takes it out of the trophy cabinet and allows his companions to enjoy a tipple			0
‘ the coolest trophy in golf , ’ he says			1
as he prepares to leave the room , he has one final thing to say about that special july in @entity97 and how proud he feels to be @entity5 champion			0
‘ do you know why winning the @entity249 was so meaningful to me ? ’ he says			0
‘ it validated to me that i have become a complete player			0
i accomplished the goal of learning a form of golf that was completely different to the one i grew up playing			0

@entity1 returns to defend @entity7 title he won in 2013
@entity27 golfer will again play the @entity5 , which he also won last year
players like @entity12 , @entity42 and @entity14 will also play at @entity36
@entity1 was told he would win @entity7 after making his debut in 1991
the 44 - year - old admits he wondered if he would ever master links golf
@entity1 describes the @entity249 as ' the coolest trophy in golf '
