' ' my blunt language suggesting that the president does n’t love @entity12 notwithstanding , i did n’t intend to question president @entity4 ’s motives or the content of his heart , ' @entity0 said in an op - ed for the @entity18			1
' my intended focus really was the effect his words and his actions have on the morale of the country , and how that effect may damage his performance			1
' @entity0 , who has taken heavy fire for the remarks he made last week at a @entity1 dinner hosted by prominent conservatives , argued that @entity4 is guilty of ' criticizing his country more than other presidents have done			1
he is now admitting that he ca n't the the commander in chief 's ' mind or heart ' ' furthermore , this president sometimes seems to have a difficult time in expressing adequate support for important allies , particularly @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49 , ' he added			2
the 2008 @entity51 presidential candidate claimed that he bears @entity4 ' no ill will , and in fact think that his personal journey is inspiring and a testament to much of what makes this country great '			1
but he expressed doubt that @entity4 ' can rise to the occasion and underscore @entity12 ’s greatness as our history and values merit			2
' ' if he does so , i will be the first to applaud him , ' @entity0 wrote			2
' but i can only be disheartened when i hear him claim , as he did last august , that our response to 9/11 betrayed the ideals of this country			0
' when he interjected that “ we tortured some folks , ” he undermined those who managed successfully to protect us from further attack , ' he asserted			0
@entity0 said he also takes issue with @entity4 's past critiques of @entity12 exceptionalism			1
to say the @entity12 is ' no more exceptional than the exceptionalism of any other country in the world , does not suggest a becoming and endearing modesty , but rather a stark lack of moral clarity , ' he argued			0
fondly referred to as ' @entity12 's mayor ' for his tenure as @entity1 's top political official during the september 11 , 2001 attacks on the @entity85 , @entity0 's legacy has taken a hit in the last week following his stern rebuke of @entity4			1
' i know this is a horrible thing to say , but i do not believe that the president loves @entity12			0
' @entity0 said during the speech			2
' he does n’t love you			0
and he does n’t love me			0
he was n’t brought up the way you were brought up and i was brought up through love of this country			2
' the flap ballooned as @entity0 repeatedly tried to clarify his remarks			1
the day after the dinner , the @entity51 told @entity98 he was not , in fact , questioning @entity4 's ' patriotism ' and was being reported			1
' he 's a patriot , i 'm sure , ' @entity0 told the news station			2
' what i 'm saying is , in his rhetoric , i very rarely hear him say the things that i used to hear @entity105 say , the things that i used to hear @entity107 say , about how much he loves @entity12			0
' and on friday , @entity0 told the @entity108 his concern about the president 's morals dates back to young @entity4 's introduction to @entity113 , a communist organizer , via his grandfather , and his relationships with quasi-communist ' figures @entity116 and rev. @entity117 , @entity4 's former pastor whose radicals sermons caused a stir in the months before the 2008 presidential election			1
@entity122 gov. @entity121 walks through a crowd to take his seat for the opening session of the @entity126 in @entity127 on saturday , where he floundered in the face of tough questions about @entity0 's remarks and his beliefs about @entity4 's faith also attending the @entity134 dinner at which @entity0 spoke was @entity122 gov. @entity121 , who also made remarks , but they were deemed off the record			1
@entity121 , considered likely to bid for the 2016 @entity51 presidential nomination , offered a muddled response when asked about @entity0 's comments			1
' i do n’t know , i honestly do n’t know , one way or the other , ' @entity121 told the @entity142 on saturday when he was again asked to give his views on @entity4 's patriotism			1
he also refused to say whether he believes that @entity4 is a @entity145 , adding a new dimension to the discussion			2
' i ’ve actually never talked about it or i have n’t read about that , ' @entity121 said of the president 's faith			2
' i ’ve never asked him that			0
' ' you ’ve asked me to make statements about people that i have n’t had a conversation with about that			0
how [ could ] i say if i know either of you are a @entity145 ? ' he asked the @entity142 reporters			0
his spokeswoman subsequently claimed he was trying to highlight ' gotcha ' questions from ' the media ' out of ' principle '			0
it is unclear if he was ever previously articulated such a principle			0
other likely contenders for the @entity166 opted to distance themselves from @entity0			2
' governor @entity167 does n’t question president @entity4 ’s motives			1
he does question president @entity4 ’s disastrous policies , ' aides to former @entity171 gov. @entity167 said in a statement on friday			1
@entity175 sen. @entity174 gave a similar response to a local radio station on friday when the subject came up			0

@entity195 sen. @entity194 told @entity196 on sunday , ' well , i love @entity0 , but i do n’t want to go there			2
the nation ’s very divided , president @entity4 has divided us more than he ’s brought us together and i do n’t want to add to that division			1
' he added : ' i have no doubt that he loves his country , i have no doubt that he ’s a patriot			0
but his primary job as @entity207 is to defend this country , and he ’s failing miserably			0
' @entity210 gov. @entity209 , a potential dark horse candidate for the presidency , likewise praised @entity0 when questioned about his claims on sunday morning , calling him ' a great @entity12 , ' in the context of the 9/11 , of @entity215			0
however , he said , ' i do n’t think it helps to question the president ’s patriotism or motives			1

@entity243 secretary @entity242 said sunday that @entity0 's statements were ' very regrettable			2
