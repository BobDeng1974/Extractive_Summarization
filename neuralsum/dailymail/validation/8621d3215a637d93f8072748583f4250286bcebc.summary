it 's one of the most prestigious events on the racing calendar so it 's no surprise that visitors to @entity5 are as well - heeled as it gets			1
next week , crowds clad in fur and fancy hats will descend on the racecourse for four days of racing , champagne breakfasts and royal visitors			1
among them will be the @entity14 who is due to present the trophy to the winner of the @entity17 on wednesday			2
prestigious : @entity5 is one of the most prestigious events on the racing calendar and attracts royalty glamorous : @entity5 is famous for its glamorously dressed racegoers - none with fake tan chic : unlike at other races were glamour reigns supreme , ladies at @entity5 dress for the weather but @entity30 is n't the only glamorous attendee expected at the racecourse next week , with @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35 among the event 's famous fans			1
so who 's who at @entity5 ? @entity39 reveals which royals and a-listers worth looking out for			2
@entity30 , @entity14 @entity42 has long been a fan of all things equestrian and is an annual visitor to @entity5 racecourse			1
always impeccably , if cosily , dressed , last year saw her arrive on the arm of her food critic son , @entity47			0
royal visit : @entity30 , seen here with son @entity47 at last year 's event , will be at @entity5 thumbs up : the @entity14 is a keen racing fan and is a regular sight come race day presentation : like last year , the @entity14 will present one of the prizes on @entity57 @entity30 , who is due to present a trophy on @entity57 this year , spent most of the 2014 event ensconced in a box beside her son - and managed to bag a winner			1
the patron of three equine charities , the @entity64 , the @entity65 and @entity66 , the @entity14 has been a rider all her life and used to hunt			0
now confined to watching thanks to a painful back , she is almost as enthusiastic about racing as the @entity70 and last month attended her first race meet of the year when she joined soldiers for the @entity73 at @entity74			0
@entity33 a professional rider in her own right , @entity33 , 33 , is a familiar sight at the @entity5 , which she attends each year			1
runner : this year 's @entity5 will see @entity33 's horse @entity80 take to the course familiar face : @entity33 , pictured at last year 's event , attended every day of last year 's @entity5 all smiles : @entity33 , although an eventer herself , is also a @entity86 racing trainer royal approval : princess @entity34 , a keen racing fan , is a regular visitor to the @entity5 last year , she was there every single day , bringing husband @entity92 on day one and spending the rest of the week watching the races alongside her mother , @entity34			1
although a eventer by trade , @entity33 is also building up a reputation for training racehorses , most famously her husband 's horse @entity80 which competed in last year 's @entity102			1
the horse , which managed a respectable seventh place finish in the event , is also expected to make an appearance at @entity5 this year , with @entity33 and @entity92 set to cheer him on from the sidelines			1
@entity33 is also training a horse owned by her mother , who , along with @entity35 , is also expected to be on the guest list at this year 's festival			1
@entity112 @entity42 of @entity114 's younger sister has become a regular visitor to @entity117 sporting events , among them @entity118 , @entity119 and , in 2013 , @entity5			1
looking good : @entity112 proved she knows her way around a dress code when she visited big day out : @entity42 of @entity114 's sister , who attended the 2013 event , failed to bag a winner sister act : the event also had a visit from the @entity129 and @entity130 the same year pictured enjoying the races in the company of @entity133 , miss @entity112 got the dress code , which encourages colour , spot on in her yellow coat			1
she topped off the look with a cosy fur hat in a style similar to the one worn by the @entity14 a year later			2
@entity140 the wife of top jockey @entity142 , blonde @entity143 is a race day veteran and never puts a ( well shod ) foot wrong			0
always there : @entity143 , the wife of champion jockey @entity142 , is a familiar face at @entity5 friends : @entity143 at @entity5 with , left , @entity33 , and right , @entity149 a close friend of @entity33 , the women were pictured sharing a joke during last year 's @entity5 and were seen together again at @entity153 the following june			1
this year 's event is set to be an emotional one for the 38 - year - old , thanks to her husband 's imminent retirement			1
@entity142 , whose career has spanned more than 20 years , has ridden more than 4,000 winners , including victories in the @entity102 and the @entity163			2
although @entity143 has spoken of her fears for her husband 's health in the past , she never fails to turn up to watch him race - always in a suitably glamorous ensemble			2
wondering who to have a flutter on ? @entity172 ' @entity171 reveals which horses are set to be first past the post at @entity5			2
tuesday - @entity175 horse : @entity176 @entity177 : 11/10 he 's called faugheen the machine for a reason and it 's hard to see his unbeaten record coming undone on tuesday , despite the impressive field			2
@entity185 jockey , @entity184 , is yet to decide his mount for the race , with stablemate and dual @entity175 winner @entity189 also lining up , but with fingers pointing towards @entity176 it 's just another reason to back him			0
wednesday - @entity193 horse : dodging bullets @entity177 : 4/1 possible winner ? @entity142 , pictured at last year 's event , will run his final @entity73 race next week all eyes might be on @entity199 and @entity200 , but @entity201 has easily had the most impressive route to this year 's @entity5 , and although a short price the @entity204 winner could and should serve up an upset to the front two in the betting			1
thursday : ladbrokes world hurdle horse : @entity211 @entity177 : 7/1 old - time favourite @entity211 could make history to become just the third @entity175 winner to also land the @entity216 trophy			0
he 's been jumping and travelling well , and after comprehensively beating @entity218 back in january he 's stamped his position as a serious contender to the younger guard			0
@entity222 horse : @entity223 @entity177 : 10/1 it 's impossible to not back @entity142 's last ever ride in the @entity73 - it would be a fairytale end to a glittering career for the 20 - time champion jockey			2
there 's still doubts whether favourite @entity230 can finally make it third time lucky at @entity5 , but for the old romantics there 's only one man that can win this year 's @entity73 , and it 's @entity142			1
@entity238 - @entity237 famous for her flamboyant taste in hats , tv presenter @entity30 is a regular visitor to @entity5 and is based in nearby @entity241			1
hat 's a winner : tv presenter @entity244 is famous for her fabulous hats high - powered : along with tv presenting , she is also a gold - medal winning gardener most of her work is for @entity250 , although she also boasts acting and modelling credits to her name			0
she is also a gold - medal winning gardener , who has shown her work at @entity254 among others , and was part of the production team at @entity258			0
to racing fans , however , she will always be the glamorous girl in the super-sized hats , with spectacular crimson , nude and chocolate numbers deployed in recent years			0
@entity263 she 's not a celebrity and she 's certainly not a royal but to racing fans , @entity266 , an equine enthusiast from @entity267 , has become a familiar sight			0
bold choice : @entity266 at @entity5 in 2013 , sporting an impressive crimson and black look she 's back ! after wowing in crimson in 2013 , ms @entity266 returned wearing vibrant print the following year that she has is largely due to her eccentric ensembles which are nearly always colourful and are , without fail , topped by a spectacular hat			1
although @entity153 and @entity280 are also on her racing season itinerary , her flair for colour is particularly noticeable during visits to @entity5			0
most impressive was her appearance on @entity284 's thursday at last year 's event , when she arrived clad head - to - toe in emerald green			1
top choice : on @entity284 's thursday 2014 , ms @entity266 wore emerald , topped with a peacock feather hat while @entity291 is famous for its scantily clad racegoers and @entity153 for its hats , the @entity5 has become synonymous with an altogether more rural approach to dressing			1
eschewing skyscraper heels and flimsy dresses in favour of elegant wool coats and comfortable patent leather boots , the race meeting offers a masterclass in country chic , complete with lashings of tweed and even a flat cap or two			0
unlike @entity153 , organisers at @entity5 refuse to impose a dress code on guests and , beyond exhortations to wrap up warm and avoid anything that might offend , say anything goes - up to and including fancy dress			2
but perhaps a warning is n't required : although the clothes donned by @entity316 's most fashionable might be rural , the looks on show certainly do n't lack glamour with oversized sunglasses , pearl necklaces and twinkling diamond stud earrings deployed to up the fashion ante			0
fur is a recurring motif , as are hats that take inspiration from rural life			0
like the stylish effort deployed by @entity33 on day one of the 2014 event , many come festooned in pheasant feathers while elegant blooms are a perennial favourite			2
male racegoers are n't immune from the pull of country style either , with most opting for tweed suits or chic red chinos teamed with a preppy navy blazer and artfully knotted tie			0
but whether girls in pearls and princess coats or preppy chaps in @entity346 check , the @entity5 is just as stylish as its @entity348 counterpart			2
but not everyone pulls it off ... @entity5 might have a fairly relaxed dress code but most , with the march weather in mind , arrive sporting a take on practical glamour			0
but not everyone gets it right , with everything from thigh - scraping skirts to bizarre hats spotted in the parade ring			0
should you need reminding , below are some of the worst offenders from last year			0
remember ladies : just because it 's tweed , does n't mean it 's classy			0
oh dear : it might be tweed but in this case , the short - skirted look certainly is n't classy brrr ! a patriotic @entity370 ensemble ( left ) and a shamrock embellished hat ( right ) tally ho ! a hunting inspired ensemble from 2014 , complete with a pheasant feather hat and a pair of gauntlets short and sweet : two 2014 racegoers chose to brave the chill in short skirts more suitable for summer			0

@entity5 has long attracted a well - heeled set of racegoers
next week 's event will include a visit from the @entity14
@entity30 is set to present race winners with prizes on @entity57
other royal visitors include @entity33 and the princess royal
her horse @entity396 , who ran in the @entity102 last year , is likely to run
other likely visitors include @entity400 and @entity112
