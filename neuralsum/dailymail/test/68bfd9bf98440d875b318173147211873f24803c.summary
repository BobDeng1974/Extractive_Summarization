an obscure agreement struck by state governments in 1993 means the vast majority of @entity3 will not get a day off this @entity4 weekend			2
under the pact , no public holiday is triggered when @entity4 falls on a saturday , as it does this year			1
the agreement was designed to provide uniformity of public holidays across the nation			0
that makes @entity4 the exception when it comes to public holidays			0
if @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 , the @entity17 or @entity18 fall on a weekend , a holiday is granted on a weekday			0
@entity30 and some public servants in @entity32 have decided to go it alone and will get monday off			1
the head of the @entity35 declared monday a public holiday for 8,500 staff , but other departments such as the @entity39 and @entity40 will have to turn up to work			2
for the rest of the country , it 's back to work on monday			0
the decision not to grant the holiday has been condemned by some groups and human resources expert @entity49 warned there would be a big jump in employees calling in sick because they feel ' entitled ' to the day off , reports @entity53			1
' employees will feel aggrieved by not having a day off , @entity3 have an entitlement mentality , ' said mr @entity49 , the boss of @entity56			0
' they 're missing out and people want their fair share			0
' mr @entity49 said bosses should expect a 20 per cent - 25 per cent rise in absenteeism on monday 27			2
in turn , some businesses have notified staff that if they they fake a sick day , they risk losing their job			1
in @entity69 alone , losses to businesses are estimated at more than $ 7.5 million if an expected 20,000 workers call in sick			1
the anniversary of the landing on @entity73 has fallen on a saturday this year , meaning all states but @entity30 will miss out on holiday on monday @entity3 state governments came together for a @entity77 meeting in 1993 to try and make public holidays consistent across the nation			1
the reason was to avoid ' costs and disruption for business ' that occurred when every state had different laws			0
the states agreed that when @entity15 , @entity88 and @entity89 fell on a weekend , a public holiday the next working day would be triggered			2
it was decided that a public holiday for @entity4 would only be triggered if it fell on a monday @entity94 , @entity95 and @entity96 would continue to be observed on the days set according to tradition across the nation			2
in @entity100 , the @entity99 called on premier @entity101 to give workers monday off , claiming the government has the power to grant an additional holiday under the @entity106			0
but @entity108 chief officer @entity107 told the @entity109 there is no need for another holiday			0
' @entity4 is a very special day for @entity3 as it commemorates the landings at @entity73 on april 25 , 1915 , and we rightly pause and take time to reflect on that day , whatever day of the week it happens to fall on each year , ' he said			1
punters playing traditional @entity3 @entity4 gambling game two - up : @entity108 officer @entity107 said there is no need for an additional holiday on for @entity4 the last time @entity4 fell on a saturday was 2009 , and before that in 1987 , 1992 and 1998			1
