by @entity0 last updated at 6:40 pm on 29th november 2011 this year is set to be the 10th warmest on record , say meteorologists			0
climate researchers in the @entity5 said that temperatures in 2011 were nearing the top of records dating back to 1850			1
this despite a ' strong and persistent ' @entity10 weather system in the @entity11 - an effect which should lead to lower temperatures across the world			1
the @entity15 ( @entity15 ) released the figures based on three sets of independent data , including a joint one from the @entity19 ( @entity20 ) - currently mired in controversy - and the @entity22 , at a climate change conference in @entity24 this week			1
however , only last week researchers at @entity20 were criticised for colluding with politicians to ‘ massage ’ evidence of man - made climate change after 5,000 emails were leaked online			1
ice coverage in the @entity46 has been declining rapidly in recent years ‘ it ’s part of a natural climate oscillation in the tropical pacific , ’ says @entity47 , senior climate scientist at the @entity22			1
‘ it oscillates between the warm @entity53 phase – @entity53 is @entity54 for “ the boy ” – and the cold @entity10 phase			0
‘ @entity10 is the cold “ little sister ” phase			0
it ’s a purely natural event that occurs every few years as part of this natural oscillation			0
‘ during @entity10 , the rainfall that normally falls over the @entity11 , shifts west over @entity63 and the northern and eastern parts of @entity65			0
‘ @entity10 effects weather patterns throughout the globe , but the further away from @entity10 you are , the more difficult it is to pinpoint the effects			0
’ the @entity15 released the figures as 200 nations meet in @entity24 , @entity73 , for the latest @entity37 talks on agreeing a deal to tackle climate change			1
the organisation , whose data also includes figures from the @entity81 , put the global average temperature at @entity83 above the 1961 to 1990 average of @entity85 , making it the 10th warmest on record			1
according to the @entity15 , the 13 warmest years on record have all occurred in the 15 years between 1997 and 2011			0
the @entity22 / @entity20 also suggested a long - term warming trend in the global climate			1
their data shows the average global temperature for january to october 2011 was @entity94 , 0.36c above the 1961 to 1990 long - term average of @entity85			1
the @entity15 's final figure is an average of the three sets of data			1
according to their researchers , each decade since the 1950s has been warmer than the previous decade , and last year was one of the warmest on record			0
@entity104 , head of climate monitoring and attribution at the @entity22 , said : ‘ this year we have seen a very persistent and strong @entity10 , which brings cooler water to the surface of the @entity11			1
‘ this has a global impact on weather and temperatures , and is one of the key reasons why this year does not figure as highly as 2010 in the rankings			0
‘ however , global temperature so far this year is likely higher than it was in the @entity10 events in 2008 and 1999 to 2000 - indicating a continuing warming trend combined with natural variability			2
’ hot air ? a delegate walks past television screens that form part of exhibits at the climate conference in @entity24 , @entity73 professor @entity127 , director of the @entity128 at @entity19 , said that natural variations from year to year meant that every year would not be warmer than the last			1
but he said : ‘ independent researchers analysing long - term trends of these indicators have seen an increase in air , sea and land temperatures , rising sea levels and decreasing @entity43 sea ice , spring snow cover in the northern hemisphere and glacier extent			2
’ the global temperature figures come as scientists warned the latest evidence was showing that global warming appeared to be a greater , rather than lesser , problem			2
@entity147 , director of the @entity148 at @entity149 and professor of meteorology at @entity152 , said : ‘ what we 've seen in the science is not one huge change but a number of things - the melting of the ice sheets , the permafrosts and release of methane and the carbon cycle - have tended towards this problem being more serious rather than less			1
’ as negotiators meet in @entity24 to discuss efforts to tackle climate change , he said it was important to get a global deal on curbing greenhouse gases that would see emissions peak around 2020 and begin to fall by around three per cent a year			1
he said : ' there 's no doubt that what the climate system feels is the total greenhouse gases we emit to the atmosphere , so unless countries can agree it 's very difficult to see how we can cap the total which is what the climate feels			2
‘ that 's why a global agreement is so important			0
’ the @entity15 report also said 2011 saw @entity43 sea ice reach the second - lowest extent of cover on record during the summer melt , and its lowest ever volume in the summer months			2
the report said @entity193 suffered another hot summer , while @entity195 was on course to have its hottest year for 140 years and @entity197 and @entity198 had their hottest january to october on record			0
but in @entity65 temperatures have been up to 1c lower than normal in places , while eastern @entity204 and @entity205 , the western @entity81 and south - western @entity203 also had below average temperatures in 2011			2
superdry : the cracked bed of @entity209 in @entity210 dramatically highlighted the severity of the state 's heatwave this summer water shock : the flooded @entity215 in the ancient @entity217 capital of @entity218 , north of @entity219 , last month severe drought in @entity221 was followed in october by heavy rain and floods in some places , while south - east @entity225 also suffered major floods			2
in the @entity81 , there were 14 separate weather and climate events which caused losses of $ 1billion ( £ 650million ) or more each , with the country hit by a range of problems including drought in @entity210 , @entity236 , october snowstorms in the north - eastern states and one of the most active tornado seasons on record			1
many parts of western @entity243 saw the driest spring on record and it was also very warm , with the @entity5 experiencing a spring that was 1.8c warmer than normal			0
' @entity246 ' at @entity19 more than 5,000 documents were leaked online last week purporting to be the correspondence of climate scientists at the @entity19 who were previously accused of ‘ massaging ’ evidence of man - made climate change			1
following on from the original ' climategate ' emails of 2009 , the new package appears to show systematic suppression of evidence , and even publication of reports that scientists knew to to be based on flawed approaches			2
and not only do the emails paint a picture of scientists manipulating data , government employees at the @entity266 ( @entity266 ) are also implicated			2
the @entity19 , where most of the emails originated			1
none of the newly released emails appears to be post 2009 , but clarify the extent of government involvement in the scandal one message appeared to show a member of @entity266 staff telling colleagues working on climate science to give the government a ‘ strong message ’			2
the emails paint a clear picture of scientists selectively using data , and colluding with politicians to misuse scientific information			1
‘ @entity286 ’ , said to work at @entity266 , writes : ‘ i can not overstate the huge amount of political interest in the project as a message that the government can give on climate change to help them tell their story			1
' they want their story to be a very strong one and do n’t want to be made to look foolish			0
’ professor @entity127 , director of the @entity128 at the centre of the affair , said the group findings did stand up to scrutiny			0
yet one of the newly released emails , written by @entity303 - who is working with the @entity304 @entity305 ( @entity305 ) - said : ' any work we have done in the past is done on the back of the research grants we get – and has to be well hidden			0
' i ’ve discussed this with the main funder ( @entity81 @entity314 ) in the past and they are happy about not releasing the original station data			0
' @entity317 , a commentator for the @entity318 , who described the earlier inquiries into the @entity246 emails as ' ineffectual ' and ' mealy mouthed ' , reportedly said : ' the closed - mindedness of these supposed men of science , their willingness to go to any lengths to defend a preconceived message , is surprising even to me			0
' the stink of intellectual corruption is overpowering			0
' the release of the information echoes the ' @entity246 ' leaks of hacked private emails two years ago ahead of crunch climate talks in @entity334 that referred to ways to ‘ hide the decline ’ in global warming			0
a series of independent reviews cleared the @entity341 researchers of impropriety , but they were told they had been too secretive .			0
