brutal : @entity6 ( left ) has been found guilty of eight counts of aggravated child abuse and now faces up to 120 years behind bars while her boyfriend @entity11 ( right ) is awaiting trial on similar charges on friday @entity19 told the court that she had n't noticed the boy was emaciated because he was always wearing baggy jumpers			1
she also claimed she had nothing to do with disciplining the boy , who was regularly locked in a cupboard and tied to a bed post			1
she said she wanted to leave the relationship with @entity11 , but that during the four years she dated him he threatened to kill her several times			1
@entity11 is currently in jail awaiting trial on similar charges			2
during the trial the boy , now 14 , described being starved nearly to death and locked in both a closet and a bathroom for days on end by his father and his father 's girlfriend			1
looking far healthier than he did when he was rescued two years ago weighing just 40 pounds , the boy testified at @entity6 ' child abuse trial wednesday , softly recounting his time with the woman , who he first met in 2009 when he was in the third grade and she was dating his dad , @entity11			1
giving short answers to the prosecutor 's questions , he said @entity19 quickly moved into their home in @entity50 , @entity1 and he began to call her ' mom			1
' but he soon started getting in trouble , beginning with the time @entity19 accused him of stealing an @entity54 , he told the court			2
' i was constantly locked up , ' the boy , who has n't been identified , said			1
he said he would escape when he was put in his room , leading @entity19 to threaten to leave @entity11 if he did n't lock the boy up			1
the boy , without shedding a tear or changing his tone of voice , told the court they put him in a closet and secured the door with a bungee cord and a desk			1
he even bravely illustrated with a laser pointer how they wrapped a cord around the knobs of the sliding closet doors to keep him inside			0
when asked if @entity19 and @entity11 would talk to him , he replied : ' not unless they were telling me to be quiet , basically			1
' they gave him diapers so they would n't have to let him out to use the bathroom and he was fed macaroni noodles , ramen noodles and sometimes canned vegetables			2
when he was out of the closet he would take any food he could find and hide it , he said			0
evidence : the court was shown pictures of the closet the boy was locked in , pictured bathroom : he was also locked in this bathroom numerous holidays passed when he was locked away , including @entity111 , @entity112 and @entity113			1
later , he was locked in a bathroom after his father zip - tied him to the post of a bunk bed for three days and he chewed through the ropes to escape			1
but he said on christmas day in 2011 he was let out of the bathroom to watch other children who lived in the house open gifts			0
he was then put back inside with a stocking full of coal			0
' i just cried , ' he recounted			0
he noticed himself getting smaller he said , and his clothes getting baggier			0
the court was shown a tiny pair of @entity129 pajamas , boys size 8 , that he was found in and pictures showing a malnourished child with gaunt cheeks and skeletal ribs			2
it was n't until march 2012 that he was rescued from his hell , when a family friend raised the alarm			2
at the time , investigators said another month of the alleged horrific abuse would have killed him			0
thankfully , there were no obvious signs of the trauma he endured when he appeared in court , now a teen , not yet 5 - feet tall			0
he smiled at times and even laughed			0
arrest : the couple were finally arrested in march 2012 when the boy was freed rescued : the boy , with his face obscured , is seen in march 2012 when police rescued him from the home making the case all the more horrific is the fact that teachers at the child 's school first reported his injuries to authorities some 17 months before he was eventually rescued			1
distraught teachers at @entity161 said they repeatedly called the @entity162 to try to get help for the boy , then aged 12			0
the abuse started while he was a pupil at the school			0
the boy moved to @entity169 where he spent just 10 days in class before being withdrawn to be home - schooled			2
@entity11 and @entity19 were angered because he was getting extra food at school , police said			1
about two months after taking him out , they told the district he would attend a private school - essentially stopping the district 's efforts to keep track of him and his education			0
home : distraught teachers at @entity161 said they repeatedly called the @entity183 to try to get help for the boy , then aged 12 , but were ignored ' we tried , and we tried , and we begged , ' said @entity187 , the boy 's teacher at the school he attended for third , fourth and fifth grade			2
' i honestly thought the next call that i got about him was that he would be dead			0
' @entity19 's ex-husband , @entity19 , said he called @entity162 12 times , concerned that his three children who lived with their mother were often dirty and had head lice			1
' i called them so many times because of my concerns with the kids , they told me to stop calling , ' he said			0
' if you â€™re told by @entity162 to stop calling , what else can you do ? who else can you call ? ' the last time the department looked into the complaints was 2010 when they decided there was not enough evidence to justify removing the boy from his father			2
' there is a difference between reporting child abuse and reporting concern and being able to remove a child from their home , ' @entity162 spokeswoman @entity214 told @entity222			1
speaking to @entity223 at the time she added : ' you ca n't remove a child on a hunch			2
of all the resources we have , the one tool we do n't have is a crystal ball			0
' begging for help : ' we tried , and we tried , and we begged , ' said @entity187 , the boy 's teacher at the school he attended for third , fourth and fifth grade , of @entity162 action was eventually taken on march 15 when a woman walked into @entity239 told officers her boyfriend had gone to a friend 's home and had seen an emaciated boy locked in the bathroom			1
detectives went to the house and found the boy curled up on the floor			2
police said the boy would be zip - tied to a bed in a standing position and forced to sleep that way			0
to stop him from crying , a dirty sock was duct - taped in his mouth			0
the couple arrived home while police were still at the property and reportedly confessed to caging and punishing the boy , including denying him food , according to local 6 news			0
they said they punished the boy because he began stealing food after it was being withheld from him , @entity50 police said in the report			0

' he was severely malnourished and treated for dehydration			0
