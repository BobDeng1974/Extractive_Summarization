but lord justice @entity34 said : ' since the monetary claim set out in the @entity36 is unsustainable as it stands there seems to me no point in granting of stay in favour of @entity2			0
' he added : ' for such a claim there is no natural forum , not because several factors point to different jurisdictions but because the claim itself is bad			0
' it means mr @entity10 can now apply to have the claim struck out , according to his lawyers			0

' the judge dealt ms @entity7 a serious blow when he ruled she would have to pursue her claim against mr @entity10 in @entity2			1
challenging that decision , @entity110 , for ms @entity7 , told the @entity20 : ' the fundamental issue will be , to put the issue at its most straighforward , what happened to the £ 80m ?

mr @entity10 has important business interests in @entity92			0
