@entity0 is today labelled as a problem in society , with diagnoses surging by as much as tenfold in some countries			1
but it may not have always been considered as something that needs treating			0
in fact , one scientist claims @entity0 may have helped the human species survive			1
@entity11 - based professor @entity10 argues that nomads who were adventurous , hyperactive and impulsive were more likely to survive in their harsh surroundings			1
@entity0 is today labelled as a problem in society , with diagnoses surging by as much as tenfold in some countries ( stock image used ) these traits are similar to ones associated with @entity0 ( @entity0 ) , a condition that affects around five per cent of the population			1
' having the profile of what we now call @entity0 would have made you a @entity27 success story , ' @entity22 psychiatry professor @entity10 wrote in the @entity29			1
scientific studies seem to back up this theory			0
professor @entity10 points to a study conducted several years ago on the @entity35 tribe in @entity36			1
the research , led by of @entity38 , analysed part of the tribe that had settled into an agricultural community			0
the rest of the tribe remained nomadic			0
the tribesmen were tested for @entity43 , a genetic variant that the study said , ' has been linked to greater food and drug cravings , novelty - seeking , and adhd symptoms			1
' professor @entity10 claims that nomads who were adventurous , hyperactive and impulsive were more likely to survive in their harsh surroundings			1
pictured is a band of @entity54 hunters in @entity55 those tribesmen who had the @entity0 - linked gene variant tended to be better nourished			2
however , in the settled group , people with @entity43 were underweight , reported @entity60			0
the study suggests certain characteristics linked with @entity0 may have helped some people survive under conditions similar to those experienced by early nomads			1
' @entity67 , with short attention spans and novelty - seeking tendencies , are probably going to have an easier time making the most of a dynamic environment , including getting more to eat , ' wrote professor @entity10			1
' this same brief attention span would not be very useful among the settled , who have to focus on activities that call for sustained focus , like going to school , growing crops and selling goods			0
' attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( @entity0 ) is a group of behavioural symptoms that include inattentiveness , hyperactivity and impulsiveness			1
@entity0 can occur in people of any intellectual ability , although it is more common in people with learning difficulties			2
people with @entity0 may also have additional problems , such as sleep and anxiety disorders			2
symptoms of @entity0 tend to be first noticed at an early age , and may become more noticeable when a child 's circumstances change , such as when they start school			2
most cases are diagnosed in children between the ages of 6 and 12			0
the symptoms of @entity0 usually improve with age , but many adults who are diagnosed with the condition at a young age will continue to experience problems			1
source : @entity111 around three to seven per cent of children , or 400,000 , are believed to have adhd in the @entity113 , with many being prescribed drugs to try and improve their concentration at school			0
in the @entity119 , around five per cent of children are thought to have adhd			0
the prevalence of @entity0 in @entity119 adult is at around three to five per cent			2
professor @entity10 says the lower value society places on @entity0 traits may account for why more children are being diagnosed with the condition each year			1
' @entity130 , with its vivid gaming and exciting social media , is a world of immediate gratification where practically any desire or fantasy can be realised in the blink of an eye , ' said professor @entity10			1
' by comparison , school would seem even duller to a novelty - seeking kid living in the early 21st century than in previous decades			0
' the comparatively boring school environment might accentuate students ' inattentive behaviour , making their teachers more likely to see it and driving up the number of diagnoses			0
' there remains controversy surrounding the condition			0
last week , experts said the global surge in @entity0 diagnosis has more to do with marketing than medicine			2
diagnosis rates and prescriptions of stimulant drugs are soaring compared with five years ago			0
however , professor @entity159 , of @entity160 claims @entity0 is ' more of an economic and cultural plague than a medical one '			2
diagnosis rates and prescriptions of stimulant drugs are soaring compared with five years @entity164 , professor @entity159 , of @entity160 claims adhd is ' more of an economic and cultural plague than a medical one '			0

this is according to @entity11 - based professor @entity10
hyperactive and impulsive nomads were more likely to survive
these characteristics are similar to those associated with @entity0
theory is backed up by a study of tribes in @entity36 with these traits
around five per cent of the population are diagnosed with condition
symptoms include difficulty staying focused and *paying* attention
