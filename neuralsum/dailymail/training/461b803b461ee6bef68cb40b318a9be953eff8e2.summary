@entity0 are hopeful of striking a deal for @entity3 teenage prospect @entity2 in the summer despite ongoing interest from @entity5			1
the 16 - year - old playmaker is rated the brightest prospect in the @entity10 club 's youth system and that has prompted scouts from @entity14 's elite clubs to visit the south of @entity10 to take a closer look			2
@entity2 has figured against @entity5 in their @entity18 ties but played 24 minutes as a substitute in the first game which @entity3 lost 4 - 1 before pulling the strings in the return in november in a 1 - 1 draw			1
bright prospect : @entity0 and @entity5 are both interested in @entity3 's 16 - year - old @entity2 ( right ) revival : @entity0 could go back in for previous target @entity26 of @entity28 ( right ) swans flying off ? @entity30 ( left ) and @entity31 are being monitored by @entity0 boss @entity32 @entity33 has been to watch him again in recent weeks but @entity0 invited @entity2 and his family as guests for the @entity37 derby at @entity38			1
@entity2 is understood to have met with @entity32 and club staff underlined how youngsters are getting a chance to progress into the first team at @entity0			1
@entity32 , who has taken @entity0 staff for a sunshine break in @entity45 this week , will be able to attract more top players in the summer if @entity0 continue their impressive @entity48 challenge			2
he remains interested in @entity49 duo @entity31 and @entity30 while a deal for @entity28 's @entity26 could be revived although they are weighing up alternatives			1
@entity54 's 24 - year - old midfielder @entity53 , who had an ill - fated loan spell at @entity56 in 2008 , has also been watched by @entity0 chief scout @entity57 at their recent game with @entity59			2
@entity60 have revived interest in @entity0 midfielder @entity62			1
the 20 - year - old has had a moderately successful loan spell in @entity65 with @entity66 who are struggling to avoid relegation and @entity60 are willing to give him a better platform			2
@entity60 , who sold @entity72 to @entity0 for £ 7m last summer , are keen to open negotiations on a permanent deal for @entity62 who was highly coveted as a youngster at @entity77 before he joined @entity0 in 2010			1

the 22 - year - old joined @entity113 from @entity114 last summer for £ 12m after protracted negotiations which prompted his agent @entity116 to declare : ' he will not be railroaded into a move that is not right for him			2
' despite proving a success in his defensive midfield role , with @entity113 conceding only 13 goals while he has been on the pitch in 18 games , @entity109 has taken time to settle on the south coast			1
his stuttering return from injury this last few weeks has further unnerved him and @entity108 will take this into account as they continue to evaluate targets			0
