cast your mind back to june 27 , 2010 , the day @entity2 ’s last @entity1 adventure ended with that horribly familiar sense of crashing disappointment			1
there had been little excitement in three group games against the @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 before the last 16 match ended up being memorable for two things – @entity15 being ludicrously denied a goal and @entity17 inflicting @entity2 ’s heaviest defeat at a @entity1 finals			1
when @entity2 suffer a major setback , like that 4 - 1 dismantling in @entity24 , it impacts on the mood of the country			1
i was a member of @entity29 ’s squad and we flew home from @entity32 knowing , once again , the @entity2 team had let the nation down			1
crashing disappointment : @entity36 reflects after the humiliating defeat by @entity17 what a letdown : @entity39 ( right ) was part of that @entity2 squad and admits they were poor big tournaments are a feast for football fanatics yet they also attract viewers who do n’t tend to follow the national sport from week to week but are desperate for @entity2 to do well			1
top class sport brings people together – success makes you feel good and lifts the atmosphere			0
think about it : we have been frequently treated during the past four years and , in the future , we may well look back at this period as being the best , most successful we have known in @entity58 sport			0
just consider all the achievements			0
@entity60 has won @entity61 and the @entity62			2
sir @entity63 and @entity64 have each won the @entity65			0
the @entity68 were magical when winning in @entity69 12 months ago , @entity2 ’s cricketers , among other things , won the @entity70 and the @entity71			1
@entity72 has put himself up with the finest boxers we have produced			2
golfers @entity76 , @entity77 and @entity78 have won the @entity62 – one of them could repeat the feat this sunday – and all three played their part in @entity84 ’s extraordinary @entity83 victory in 2012			2
all smiles : there is much more positivity around @entity36 and the @entity2 camp this time around that is without mentioning the wonderful show we put on for the world with the @entity93 , with the high point being that famous saturday night when we all sat around our televisions screaming @entity96 , @entity97 and @entity98 on to gold medals			1
i would n’t say for a moment that @entity102 into the above sports all the time			0
i would n’t have a great interest in rugby union , for instance , but i was intoxicated by the @entity68 and i ca n’t wait for the @entity1 next year			2
i love the drama of the big events and seeing @entity58 sportsmen succeeding			0
so now the onus falls on the footballers to get the country bouncing			0
@entity2 may have travelled to @entity114 with expectations being talked down but come saturday night in @entity116 , when the first ball is kicked and @entity118 gets underway , millions will be allowing themselves to dream			2
after all , it has been too long since there was a buzz about @entity2 in a major tournament			1
you could argue there was when @entity36 emerged at @entity125 or when @entity126 exploded during @entity127 1998 but i ’d say @entity128 was the last time the country came alive because of football			1
inspiration : @entity97 ( left ) and @entity96 showed in 2012 that @entity58 sportspeople can succeed defying history : @entity60 became the first @entity134 to win the @entity61 men 's singles title in in 77 years @entity137 's the limit : sir @entity63 ( left ) won the @entity65 in 2012 and @entity64 followed in 2013 carrying the hopes : @entity141 's memorable tackle on @entity142 epitomised the detemination of the successful @entity68 down under last year we have underperformed for too long when you consider the amount of top class players who have been available			1
i ’m not singling anyone out but we all – myself included – could have done better in tournaments in @entity151 , @entity152 , @entity17 and @entity32			2
but there was negativity about the @entity2 squad before a ball had even been kicked at the last two @entity157			2
in 2006 , there was the furore of @entity160 of selecting @entity161 , then an uncapped 17 - year - old who had not made his @entity165 debut , and headlines about wags			0
great britons : @entity168 should take inspiration from the likes of @entity72 ( @entity171 ) and @entity98 ( r ) happy days : @entity173 and @entity174 brought joy to the nation when they celebrated @entity70 glory over @entity69 in 2009 silver lining : @entity78 became the first @entity180 in 43 years to win the @entity62 when he triumphed at @entity181 last year four years ago , things had gone the other way with @entity29 being criticised for getting too many thirty - somethings in at the last minute – i was one , @entity186 might have been another			1
there was also scepticism about the ‘ military ’ set up that had been chosen for our base in @entity192			0
using that as a reason for why @entity2 failed , however , is just an excuse			0
quite simply , we were not good enough			0
@entity197 days : @entity198 96 , which included this famous @entity200 goal celebration , was the last time @entity2 cam alive because of football will @entity2 be good enough to go all the way in @entity114 ? i do n’t expect them to			1
privately , i ’m sure @entity205 , his staff and players will feel the same but the @entity1 can still be a success even if @entity2 do not contest the final next month			1
the biggest thing @entity205 and the team can do is excite us ; to get us hugging strangers in the pub and dancing around our living rooms because @entity2 have played with style and won the contests that matter			1
@entity205 ’s reputation is not for being bold but as a nation we are willing him to be brave			2
let this be a tournament that features @entity2 moments we remember for the right reasons , like the 3 - 0 win over @entity224 in 1986 when @entity225 scored , @entity227 ’s volley against @entity228 at @entity229 and the thumping , @entity200 - inspired 2 - 0 win over @entity232 at @entity128			1
thrill them : @entity2 need to get fans like the @entity236 family from @entity237 dancing around their living rooms there is genuine hope with the squad @entity205 has selected @entity2 wo n’t end up dead on their feet in the knockout stages , hanging on for a draw and losing on penalties as was the case against @entity247 in the quarter - finals of @entity249			1
@entity250 , @entity251 , @entity252 , @entity253 and @entity254 are all young players with technique but they can also run and their legs will be vital			0
hopefully one or two of them – maybe @entity250 and @entity252 – will make a difference and get @entity2 off to a flying start in @entity116			0
should the worst happen and @entity2 fail to get out of their group , there will be more inquests and more negativity but youth gives hope for the future			0
if they take their chance , who knows where they will be in two years			0
the first objective , though , is to get the nation believing again .			0

@entity2 players felt like they *'d* let the nation down after @entity17 defeat
@entity205 's men can take inspiration from victorious *olympians* , @entity68 , @entity60 , @entity72 and @entity78
it has been too long since there was a buzz around @entity2 at a major tournament - @entity128 was the last time
we want this tournament to be remembered for the right reasons
