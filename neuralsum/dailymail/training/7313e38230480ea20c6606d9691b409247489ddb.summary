published : 19:05 est , 22 may 2013 updated : 21:58 est , 22 may 2013 a professional basketball player might not be feeling very grown up today after he debuted a huge back tattoo only for someone to point out a glaring spelling error			2
while not on the court , @entity6 ’s @entity5 has been busy getting a lot of ink done			1
a masterpiece appears to take up basically the entirety of the 6 - foot - 9 ballers back			2
all grown up ? down at the bottom of this massive tattoo , 24 - year - old basketball star @entity5 's back now permanently misspells ' mature ' the 24 - year - old forward debuted his body art , which features an angel looking down upon a crucified @entity19 , on his @entity21 feed tuesday night			1
beside the religious imagery is a bible verse , and it is those words that have @entity5 , whose contract with the @entity6 will pay $ 85 million , looking juvenile			1
‘ all done , ’ wrote @entity5 along with his post			0
‘ @entity28 … look it up			0
’ unfortunately for @entity5 , a reader at @entity30 did look it up and found something suspect			0
grounded : the tattoo features an angel with a basketball and @entity19 's head , along with the misspelling , which is within a bible verse but they need n’t have gone through the trouble because no matter where the words come from , ‘ mature ’ is always spelled the same way			1
and @entity5 ’s back has it wrong			0
‘ let it do its work , ’ the tattoo reads , ‘ so you become mautre and well - developed … ’ the ‘ @entity51 ’ and the ‘ t ’ have evidently been transposed			0
as embarrassing as this must be for the two - time @entity56 scoring champion , he ’s not the first high - profile , high - earning name to get incorrect ink			0
@entity60 , the young star of @entity62 ’s @entity61 , recently opened up in an issue of @entity64 about some words inked onto her back			1
common : starlet @entity60 is also in the famous people with misspelled tattoos club , one of the @entity72 words seen here is incorrectly spelled the phrase , in @entity72 , reads ‘ vivere senza rimipianti ’ or ‘ live without regrets			1
’ however , there is an extra ‘ i ’ and it ’s supposed to read ‘ rimpianti			0
’ ‘ so i literally have to live by that advice , ’ joked the starlet , who said she ’ll likely get it fixed but is n’t overly concerned for now			0
@entity83 made a similar mistake when she once got a tattoo of @entity87 characters on her hip intending it to say ‘ mysterious , ’ but it actually meant ‘ strange			1
’ and heavily inked @entity89 is even in the club			1
he once got a tattoo that misspelled wife @entity93 ’s first name			0
as mockery of @entity5 's mishap swelled wednesday along with the inflamed skin of his back , he apparently rushed to get the mistake fixed			2
he updated his @entity21 feed around 8pm along with a new picture , writing : ' i got mature spelled the right way lol			0
' all better : @entity5 was mocked across the @entity103 wednesday and apparently knew it : he updated his @entity21 to show he 's now fixed the mistake permanent : heavily tattooed @entity89 is in the club , too			1
he even misspelled wife @entity93 's name			2

@entity6 's *multi-million* *dollar* baller is looking mighty juvenile , but @entity60 , @entity89 , and @entity83 are also in in the incorrectly inked *celebrity* club
