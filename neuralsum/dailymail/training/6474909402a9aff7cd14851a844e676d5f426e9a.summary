by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor president @entity4 has become the ' @entity5 ' of congressional politics , a @entity3 political operative told @entity7 on wednesday , with @entity9 senators terrified to be seen with him as they fight to keep their jobs in november			1
@entity4 delivered a fiery @entity12 speech tuesday night that was more about style than substance , drawing jeers for avoiding mention of the scandals that have plagued his administration since his last speech to a joint session of @entity23			1
the president raised eyebrows and @entity3 ' hackles before the address by threatening to go around @entity23 to implement his agenda , but proceeded to present a laundry list of desires that require collaboration with @entity32			2
sen. @entity71 of @entity72 , a @entity73 struggling to avoid being swept out of office , dodged questions from @entity76 afterward about whether or not he would welcome a presidential visit in his state			1
' is he a liability for you – the president – back home ? ' @entity76 's @entity79 asked him in an interview after the president 's @entity12 address			0
' does that mean you 're going to campaign with him ? ' @entity79 demanded			0
' that was not a yes or no , ' @entity79 pressed after another lukewarm reply			0
' we 'll see what the president 's schedule is , we 'll see what my schedule is ' he said			0
' but @entity99 are going to re-elect me based on my record , not the president 's record			0
' a @entity3 campaign pollster in @entity71 's home state of @entity72 told @entity7 that the senator has good reason to avoid the topic			1
' the president is officially the @entity5 of @entity44 politics , ' the longtime @entity109 operative said , while asking not to be named			1
' if he comes to @entity72 to campaign with @entity71 , they 're both going to get clobbered			1
' tough stuff : @entity4 visits the @entity114 in @entity115 , @entity116 today , to follow up on his sotu themes of job creation and retirement policies @entity120 out the policies : @entity4 set out a wish - list of reforms he aims to achieve in his landmark address but whether or not they can be realized will rely on @entity23 , not just executive action toxic : @entity4 , at the @entity37 bakery today , will visit @entity128 on thursday to speak at a @entity130 plant in @entity131			1
the @entity9 mayor will not be there			2
neither will @entity133 , the @entity73 running to unseat gov. @entity135 in november @entity136 , a @entity3 - aligned super pac , produced a graphic on wednesday showing the states @entity4 is visiting this week and next			1
the picture is one of the @entity141 carefully avoiding places where @entity1 's increasing skepticism of his leadership might hurt @entity9 senators			1
' @entity147 in competitive elections are going to have to freshen up their excuse @entity149 this fall if president @entity4 is headed their direction , ' explained @entity1 rising executive director @entity153 , a former deputy communications director at the @entity154			2
' but pretending to be otherwise engaged is not going to save these @entity147 from the leader of their party 's sinking approval ratings in november			2
' @entity4 may be a political ' @entity5 ' as he goes into a five - state campaign swing following his @entity12 address @entity4 's political radioactivity is also giving down - ticket candidates something to worry about			1
he will visit @entity128 on thursday to speak at a @entity130 plant in @entity131			1
the @entity9 mayor will not be there			2
neither will @entity133 , the @entity73 running to unseat gov. @entity135 in november			0
she ' has a full day scheduled in western @entity128 thursday and will not be able to join the president during his visit to @entity128 , ' her spokesman , @entity165 , said tuesday			1
republicans in the state can hardly conceal their glee			0
' it 's no surprise that millionaire @entity133 is hiding from president @entity4 , ' @entity128 state @entity3 executive director @entity171 retorted in a statement			1
he described president @entity4 as ' her party 's unpopular leader and the architect of a disastrous health care law and policies that have resulted in record debt and a sluggish national economy			2
' nationally , senate majority leader @entity183 tried tuesday night on @entity76 to stop the bleeding , insisting that @entity9 incumbents will ultimately embrace @entity4			1
' @entity4 is personally a very popular guy			0
and people love this man			0
they love his family , " @entity183 said			0
the president ' is a good person to campaign for anybody , ' he insisted			0
' the president understands government			0
but he also understands politics			0
and that 's why he won two elections overwhelmingly , ' but @entity9 senators @entity197 of @entity198 and @entity199 of @entity200 made headlines recently when they failed to turn up at presidential events in their states			1
tuesday 's @entity12 seemed more tailored to building @entity4 's legacy than helping democrats get elected , making it even less likely that @entity9 senators will welcome him with open arms in the fall @entity209 sen. @entity208 , another @entity73 fighting for political survival , said last night that he would welcome an @entity4 visit to @entity1 's northern frontier – but only so he could show @entity4 how wrong his energy policies are , specifically regarding drilling for oil and gas in the @entity216			1
' when i ran and won was the same year he ran for his first election for the presidency , he lost @entity209 by 22 points and i still won my election , ' @entity208 boasted			2
' if he wants to come up , i ’m not really interested in campaigning			0
what i ’d like him to do is see why his policies are wrong on @entity226 , for example , ' he said			0
' he opposes oil and gas development			0
i ’d like to show him why it ’s the right move to move that forward , to create jobs in oil and gas			0
' @entity147 need to hold on to their majority in order to prevent @entity3 from controlling the entire @entity23 during president @entity4 's last two years in office			1
they are defending 21 seats in november , compared with just 15 for @entity3			2
five of those are in red states – @entity209 , @entity241 , @entity242 , @entity243 , and @entity244 – where @entity245 notes @entity4 averaged just 35 - percent support last year			1
that reality has created scenarios where vulnerable democrats are shunning a politically toxic @entity4 , whose potent scandals have tainted his @entity251			0
since 2004 just 4 out of 49 incumbent senators have won re-election when their party 's sitting president was less popular in their home states than he was nationally , notes @entity258			2
' @entity147 have a big problem , ' the inside - the - beltway newspaper concludes			0
' president @entity4 is very , very unpopular in the states democrats have to defend in the 2014 elections			2

@entity4 is polling at just 35 per cent approval in five key ' red ' states where @entity9 senators must defend their seats in november
sen. @entity71 of @entity72 dodged questions tuesday night about whether he wanted the president to campaign with him
' the president is officially the @entity5 of @entity44 politics , ' a @entity72 @entity3 operative told @entity7
sen. @entity208 of @entity209 said he wanted @entity4 to visit , but only so he could *convince* the president that his energy policy is all wrong
@entity4 will visit @entity131 , @entity128 on thursday , but the mayor will be a no - show , and so will the @entity9 candidate for governor
@entity9 senators in @entity198 and @entity200 have already *bailed* on @entity4 when he came to their states for high - *profile* speeches
