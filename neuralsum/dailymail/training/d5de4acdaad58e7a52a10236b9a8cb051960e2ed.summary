68 - year - old @entity1 - @entity0 was born blind and would have continued to live without vision if he had n't fallen down his stairs two years ago			1
the fall sent him to the hospital for fractures around his eye sockets and when treating his injuries a surgeon for the first time realized his blindness was curable			2
@entity0 was born with congenital nystagmus , a condition that made his eyes move side to side involuntary and had damaged optic nerves and cataracts on top of that			1
he had resigned himself to the fact that he would never be able to see			0
' it 's bad luck but that 's how it is , ' he told the @entity26			0
late - life sight : @entity1 - @entity0 of @entity29 , @entity28 was born blind but surgery this year gave him vision for the first time but then he fell down a set of stairs in his @entity29 apartment two years ago , and it may have been the best thing to ever happen to him			1
the fall required surgery on @entity0 's face , where the thin bones around his eye sockets fractured			1
while consulting with a plastic surgeon , she asked nonchalantly : ' oh , while we 're at it , do you want us to fix your eyes , too ? ' @entity0 was shocked			1
he did n't think it was possible			0
surgery : @entity0 was born with congenital nystagmus , but it was the cataracts behind his pupils that rendered him legally blind but he grew up in the 1940s before free health care and the advancement of eye surgery			1
according to dr @entity56 , head of the ophthalmology clinic at @entity58 , it was the cataracts that caused @entity0 to be legally blind - and not the disease			1
all they had to do was remove the cataracts			0
' it feels great to do something like this			0
there 's always a positive story to tell when it comes to ophthalmology , ' he said			0
with the repair of his vision , @entity0 said he feels like a child all over again			1
while visiting his sister @entity72 in @entity73 , @entity28 , he witnessed flowers and trees blooming for the first time			1
colorful world : @entity0 saw flowers and trees in bloom this year for the first time ' i find everything beautiful , ' he said			2
' faces , skin - i find it all beautiful			2
' @entity0 ' new found vision has caused a few problems though , as he has to learn everything over again as if he were a child			1
when he went to the corner store with his sister , he handed the cashier a $ 10 bill when he really should have handed a $ 5 bill			0
colors still confuse him , and the first time he stepped out onto his sixth - floor balcony , the drop down gave him vertigo			0
the idea of remembering things visually is hard as well , and he still resorts to touching and feeling the world around him to store those memories			0
but overall , @entity0 is happy now that he has the ability to see			2
' before this everything way grey , ' he said			0
happy : despite the struggles of relearning everything , @entity0 is happy to finally see			2

@entity1 - @entity0 , 68 , of @entity29 , @entity28 was born blind
a fall two years ago required @entity0 to receive surgery on his face , and surgeons *offered* to fix his vision
