by @entity0 @entity1 has demanded a reaction from his @entity4 side after the world champions were humbled 5 - 1 by @entity6 in their @entity8 opener			1
@entity1 's side , in a replay of the 2010 final , looked a shadow of their usual selves after going ahead in the 26th minute with a @entity15 penalty			2
but @entity16 and @entity17 got two apiece before @entity18 sealed it with a fifth as the @entity6 put @entity21 's top - ranked team to shame			1
down but not out : @entity1 says @entity22 must show a reaction when they face @entity25 frustrated : @entity26 won the penalty in the first half that gave @entity22 the lead but could n't inspire a win hurt : @entity22 could n't keep hold of their lead after @entity15 put his penalty away in the first half it got @entity6 off to the best possible start , and @entity22 the worst			1
@entity1 , though , refuses to accept the top spot in @entity39 is done and dusted just yet , and knows that is the nature of the game			0
' it 's sport , we lost			0
it is necessary to accept defeat , ' he told @entity47			0
' we must recognise our mistakes , but everyone fought for a better result			0
' i am aware that it is a very delicate time for us			0
' together we have to try to solve it for the next match against @entity25 and look for the win			0
' @entity1 then suggested @entity57 's missed chance - an audacious chip from the @entity60 midfielder - before @entity6 's equaliser was crucial to the match			1
' they played better in the second half , but we dominated in the first and went from possibly 2 - 0 possible with @entity57 to 1 - 1 immediately , ' he said			2
minimal : substitute @entity66 could n't inspire @entity22 back into the game after replacing @entity26 opposite : @entity18 celebrates scoring @entity6 's fifth goal in the 5 - 1 annihilation of @entity22 at the @entity8			1

@entity22 lost 5 - 1 to @entity6 in first @entity8 game since they won it in 2010
@entity16 and @entity17 *instrumental* in defeat , scoring two each
@entity22 boss @entity1 says they are *focused* on @entity25 match
