by @entity0 published : 08:32 est , 30 october 2013 updated : 12:01 est , 30 october 2013 fears have been raised that a batch of supermarket pasta could be contaminated with weevils after two customers discovered infestations			1
@entity7 , 60 , was about to start cooking dinner when she found a swarm of the black beetles inside her unopened bag of fusilli pasta			1
mrs @entity7 , from @entity13 , @entity14 , purchased the 500g bag from a branch of @entity17 in @entity18 on saturday			1
@entity7 was about to start cooking when she found a swarm black weevil bugs inside her pasta bag she is the second person in two weeks to find her ' @entity23 ' pasta bag from a @entity17 store infested she is the second person in as many weeks to have discovered a swarm of bugs in the @entity29 @entity28 pasta packets			1
the first infested bag was found by @entity31 , 39 , who purchased a 500g bag from a @entity17 store around 30 miles from @entity18 in @entity34 , @entity35 , on 12 october			1
she was cooking a tuna pasta bake for her two young children when she made the discovery			2
there are now concerns that other packets on the shelves of the supermarket giant could contain the creatures			0
mrs @entity7 , who suffers from me , has not yet complained to @entity17 or returned the pasta because of her ill - health			1
she said : ' i ’m not the first person this has happened to , but i want to make sure other people are aware this is happening because it ’s really disgusting			0
' the whole packet of pasta was alive with hundreds of horrible black bugs crawling around , some of the creatures are half an inch long , so they are very noticeable			0
' i have no idea how they got inside , but it really makes my skin crawl			0
she added : ' i ’m not impressed that they have managed to get through the packaging			0
' mrs @entity7 purchased the 500g bag from a branch of @entity17 in @entity18 on saturday mrs @entity68 , an account manager at a marketing company , found the weevils in her bag two weeks ago mrs @entity68 , whose daughters are pictured here , purchased a 500g bag from a @entity17 in @entity34 , @entity35 mrs @entity31 , an account manager at a marketing company , said : ' if there are eggs in the pasta hatching into live insects there could be more packets out there like this			1
' there could be more people out there finding weevils in their pasta - i knew i could n’t have been the only one			1
' @entity17 gave me my money back but that ’s not what i wanted			1
i wanted them to look into it			0
' a weevil is a type of beetle which is usually less than six millimetres ( 0.24 in ) long			0
there are more than 60,000 species in several families and can often be found in dry foods including nuts and seeds , cereal and grain products , such as pancake mix. in the domestic setting , they are most likely to be found when a bag of flour is opened			2
their presence is often indicated by the granules of the infested item sticking together in strings , as if caught in a cobweb			0
despite both women discovering their pasta bags to be infested with the insects , food manufacturer @entity28 does not believe the whole batch is contaminated			1
' there is not a contaminated batch of pasta , and weevils are not a big issue in the food industry , ' a spokesman said			2
' most products that are dried like flour , rice and pasta , have tiny holes in the packets that we can not see , otherwise moisture can not escape and you would have soggy food			0
' weevils can come from any country and can even find their way into totally sealed food bags			0
' they can not survive the temperature at which our pasta dough is created , and we of course carry out frequent and extensive checks and control procedures			0
' they added : ' we are completely confident that they have not originated at source , but have come into contact with the pasta bag after it left the production unit			2
' if we had an infestation , we would expect to see weevils in hundreds of bags , including our retained control samples			2
' mrs @entity68 was cooking a tuna pasta bake for her two young children when she made the discovery a @entity17 spokesman said of the second discovery : ' as soon as the item is returned to store we will conduct a thorough investigation with the supplier			1
' we will keep the customer updated with the findings			0
