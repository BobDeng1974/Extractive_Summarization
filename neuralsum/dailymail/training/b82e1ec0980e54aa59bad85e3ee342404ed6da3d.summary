@entity0 , unusually for a top sports personality , has acted for himself throughout the negotiations and writing of his autobiography @entity5 , to be published by @entity6 next week			1
the process has gone remarkably smoothly according to the publishers , despite @entity0 never having met acclaimed author @entity9 before their collaboration on the book			2
@entity0 used to be represented by @entity14 - based solicitor @entity13 , who is known as a tough negotiator			2
@entity13 said : ‘ @entity0 does n’t need an agent			2
he ’s more than capable of looking after himself			0
’ @entity0 ( right ) , next to @entity18 boss @entity17 , has acted as his own agent for his book deal a line has now been drawn under @entity24 ’s woeful @entity23 performance after manager @entity25 explained what went wrong to the @entity28 board last week			1
@entity25 , accompanied by @entity24 managing director @entity29 , made an hour - long presentation about events in @entity32 to the @entity28 directors at a @entity35 hotel			0
the board concluded that @entity25 , his backroom staff and the @entity28 administrators had done all they could to provide the right platform for the players to perform at their best — but to everyone ’s great disappointment , this had n’t happened			1
@entity25 was given a chance to explain @entity46 's @entity45 failings to the @entity28 however , it was felt there was no sign of any @entity51 - style discord in the @entity24 camp and that the players still had every faith in the manager			1
@entity25 was fortunate to have his debriefing meeting scheduled so long after the disastrous tournament and with the bonus of making a winning start in @entity61 qualifying			0
although the usefulness of all members of the 88 - strong @entity23 party will continue to be examined , @entity25 can now concentrate on reaching @entity65 with his @entity32 inquiry closed			1
@entity67 escaped a driving ban despite clocking up 12 points on his licence at @entity71 after his celebrity solicitor @entity72 pleaded a case of exceptional hardship			1
@entity72 , as @entity75 predicted , talked up the effect a ban would have on @entity67 ’s depression charity work , caring for his 84 - year - old mother and his @entity81 pundit job			2
@entity67 escaped a driving ban after a hearing at @entity71 it summed up how boorish the @entity86 ’ association awards dinner has become when a glazed @entity87 , asked on stage by host @entity89 in front of a mixed audience whether he had any plans to make a comeback like @entity94 , replied : ‘ i ’ve got two words for you			1
f * * * off			0
’ @entity97 ( left ) believes he is free from any confidentiality clause for his forthcoming autobiography @entity97 book alert for @entity101 @entity24 outcast @entity97 believes he is free from any confidentiality clause to say what he likes in his autobiography to be published next week			1
but there is a different view at the @entity101 because a clause in the players ’ central contracts , signed by @entity97 , forbids players divulging private dressing - room information ‘ during or after your central contract ’			1
the @entity101 have not been given advance copies of the book by publishers @entity117 , who feared it would have leaked			0
so the @entity120 ’s lawyers will be looking closely for breaches of that contract when they eventually gain sight of the contents			0
@entity125 , the former @entity24 rugby international who has been linked with top jobs at @entity129 , has been lined up for a leading role with @entity131 , based in @entity132 , @entity133 , from where the organisation will run the new @entity136			0
@entity137 is made an mbe by the @entity139 during an investiture ceremony at @entity141 it is hard to take the @entity28 ’s anti-discrimination stance seriously when referee grandee @entity137 received his mbe for services to football at an investiture ceremony at @entity141			0
this is the same @entity137 who escaped with only a rap over the knuckles for making a racist comment to an @entity28 colleague during a @entity154 summit			0
asked what he would say to anyone who questioned his eligibility for such an honour , @entity137 replied : ‘ i do n’t think i want to comment on that			0
