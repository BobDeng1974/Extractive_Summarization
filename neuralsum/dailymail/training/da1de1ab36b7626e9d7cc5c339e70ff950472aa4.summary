by @entity0 last updated at 12:20 pm on 2nd december 2011 footage has been unearthed which shows science fiction author sir @entity2 thought @entity3 would land the first man on the moon in 1968			1
the late 2001 : a @entity7 author made his space race forecast in 1961 , even predicting @entity3 would set foot on the moon on the 50th anniversary of the @entity12			1
previously thought to be lost , the @entity14 interview shows @entity2 chatting to friend tv astronomer sir @entity15 in an episode of @entity17 , the world 's longest running television science programme			1
predictions : @entity2 , pictured here in 1974 , said the @entity3 would win the space race in the interview in 1963 it had been two years since the @entity3 got the first man into space , @entity25 , in april 1961 , but it was the @entity27 who would disprove his theory and get to the moon first			0
it was thought the broadcast had vanished , but it has just been discovered in a television station archive in @entity34 by collectors looking for lost episodes of @entity37			2
the grainy footage shows @entity2 predicted the @entity27 would lag behind the @entity3 and reach the moon just two years later			0
landing : although @entity2 predicted @entity3 would be first to land on the moon , he did get the date almost right as @entity43 and @entity42 ( pictured ) landed in 1969 flying the flag : @entity2 thought @entity3 would win the space race , he was proven wrong as @entity43 and @entity42 landed on the moon and he was n’t far wrong with his prediction of : ' around 1970 , if you want to pin me down			0
’ it was 1969 when @entity43 put his left foot on to the surface of the moon			0
he said : ' @entity55 moon project is a colossal thing , costing $ 10m a day			0
i believe they will succeed in getting a man on the moon – and back again , which is equally important – not before 1970 , but it will not be much after that			0
' after seeing the film of the interview again after almost half a century , @entity15 told the @entity65 : ' we got some right , some not so right			1
i do n't think we did too badly			0
' the @entity17 : @entity15 , pictured in 1961 presenting the show , said he was thrilled new footage had been unearthed the film was discovered in an @entity34 television archive by one of an eccentric gang of collectors			1
their prime target is lost episodes of @entity37 , but they recognised the exceptional rarity of the 1963 @entity17 interview			2
the collector , who bought it from the archive sent it back , still in its original film can , as a gift to the current @entity17 production team			2
footage from the reel will be shown in december 's @entity17 programme next week			1
discovering the footage was incredibly moving for @entity15 as it is the only record of the only programme which he and friend @entity2 made live together in a studio			1
although he did interview @entity2 again , it was through filmed inserts or taped phone interviews			0
the @entity101 science fiction author , inventor and futurist died in his adoptive homeland of @entity105 in 2008 aged 90			2
