by @entity0 published : 07:48 est , 24 april 2012 updated : 07:11 est , 11 may 2012 plans to build the world 's largest wind farm at one of @entity6 's top tourist attractions are facing new opposition after protestors mocked up a video showing how the giant turbines will ' blight ' the area			1
the controversial project will see 250 , 450ft turbines built a few miles off @entity6 ’s heavily - protected @entity15 - each one taller than the @entity16 the £ 3 billion farm will be visible to the millions of tourists who visit the @entity20 and @entity22 coast every year - and tourism chiefs fear it will drive visitors away from the area , currently @entity27 's only natural world heritage site			1
the results have left local tourism bosses and residents shocked			2
they fear the farm will be a blot on the landscape and put people off from visiting the area			0
the turbines , which will protrude 330ft out of the water , will provide enough energy to power 820,000 homes			1
@entity53 energy company @entity52 have earmarked a 76 square mile area of the @entity55 for the @entity56			0
they have got permission from the @entity59 , which owns the sea bed , but they will need planning consent from the government			0
@entity64 , of @entity65 , a group opposing the farm , is an engineer specialising is mathematical modelling and has created the video showing what the windfarm will look like			1
he said : ' i decided to create the video because i felt the public had not been well informed about the plan			1
' hundreds of hours of work have gone into making the video , we combined different software and used mathematics to do it			1
' it provided a better and more accurate interpretation than a static image and i think that the movement , brightness , and contrast , make it more convincing and realistic			0
' when people have seen the animation they think ‘ is it really like that ? ’ ' i think it ’s a risk to tourism , it ’s not particularly pretty and that will affect it			1
' the farm will be next to two areas of outstanding natural beauty and next to a @entity97 , so my opinion is that if they were to put the wind turbines in as the animation shows then it would be an eyesore			1
' towering : at 450 feet each turbine will be taller than the @entity16 arch ( 440 feet ) the turbines will be positioned about 10 miles off @entity106 and eight miles off @entity107			1
@entity108 , a member of @entity109 , was one of a number of local dignitaries for local authorities who were shown the video			2
he said : ' everyone who saw it was shocked			0
' my reaction was one of concern when i saw it			0
it is a lovely setting on our @entity123 and the wind farm will have a huge impact			0
' it will adversely effect tourism			0
people do not want to see a whole load of these wind farms when they visit the coast			0
' it will also have effect on the water leisure and marine industries and the impact on migrating birds , they will get killed in the turbines			2
' the video montage showed quite clearly the dominance of the proposal , the hundreds of turbines would transform the area from a residential and leisure bay with a small fishing fleet into an industrial site of an unacceptable scale			1
' @entity149 , of @entity150 , added : ' it is clear that the impact of the wind farm is far more significant than that shown in the @entity65 documentation			0
' of particular interest is the scale of the proposal , the distance from the coastal vantage points			0
' the video montage showed quite clearly the dominance of the proposal			2
' @entity163 , the @entity163 mp for @entity164 , has launched a petition calling for the turbines to be positioned out of view of the coast			2
@entity169 , consents manager for @entity170 , said : ' @entity52 is unable to comment on the accuracy of the ‘ @entity65 ’ videos as we are not aware of the methodology which was used to create them on the website			2
' at the public exhibitions @entity52 showcased its own visualisation montages to give people an idea of how the wind farm could look from various viewpoints along the south coast with these being developed by an independent specialist consultancy which adhered to @entity186 ( @entity186 ) methodology for developing visual montages for wind farm developments			0
' a previous version of this article erroneously referred to the @entity15 as @entity27 ’s only @entity97 , we are happy to clarify that the @entity15 is @entity27 ’s only natural @entity97 .			1
