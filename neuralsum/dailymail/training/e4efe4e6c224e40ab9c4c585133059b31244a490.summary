@entity1 manager @entity0 has described @entity3 striker @entity2 as having ' come on leaps and bounds '			1
@entity0 is considering naming the 21 - year - old in his @entity1 squad for the first time , having taken notice of @entity2 's goalscoring exploits at @entity11			1
@entity2 scored two goals against @entity13 in @entity3 's 5 - 3 win and is being tipped to be involved in @entity1 's next game against @entity16 on march 27			1
@entity2 has been in sensational form for @entity3 - most recently netting a double against @entity13 @entity19 ( right ) celebrates with @entity2 ( centre ) after scoring their fifth goal against @entity13 @entity0 's selection , however , could have repercussions for @entity25 , the @entity26 manager ahead of the @entity27 in june			1
' @entity2 is one of those players – @entity29 being another one – who did n't exactly burst on to the scene in his club side and get straight in , ' @entity0 told @entity32			2
' they got loaned out first and sent out to different places to learn their trade , if you like , or at least pick up some important aspects of their trade			0
' we have watched [ @entity2 ] for a while and i worked with him briefly in the under - 21s when i filled in for one game			2
@entity2 has come on in leaps and bounds and i 'm not surprised because i know [ former coaches ] @entity49 and @entity50 very well			0
after a stunning first half of the season @entity2 is now in line to make the step up to the @entity1 senior side @entity1 manager @entity0 described @entity3 's @entity2 as having ' come on leaps and bounds ' ' they have worked with him at @entity3 and they always believed in him as a goalscorer			1
it 's tremendous to see people like him doing so well and quite strange that in the under - 21s a year or two ago we were bemoaning the fact we did n't think our forwards were up to the level of the midfielders			2
' and yet suddenly @entity2 , @entity68 and @entity69 are all doing exceptionally well			0
it will be a headache for @entity25 who he picks to play in the summer			0
' @entity0 reserved special praise for @entity74 striker @entity73 , too			2
' @entity73 is doing very well , ' he continued			0
' he 's another one who has come through the lower leagues and , a bit like @entity77 , i 'm sure people have watched @entity73 many times and dismissed him because he does n't run like the wind			0
' you can be a good footballer sometimes without needing to run like the wind and @entity84 has brought the best out of him for @entity74			0
' @entity3 goalkeeper @entity86 celebrates with @entity2 after the win over @entity13			1

@entity2 scored twice against @entity13 during @entity3 's 5 - 3 win
the 21 - year - old is being considered for a call - up to the @entity1 squad
@entity0 has taken note of the in - form @entity3 striker
