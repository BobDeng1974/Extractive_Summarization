during her interview , dr @entity5 asked if she knew if the comedian had sexually assaulted her			1

but she wanted him to know that she knew he had done something wrong			0
@entity4 joins more than two dozen women who have claimed in recent weeks that @entity1 drugged and sexually assaulted them in incidents stretching back to the 1960s and as recently as the 2000s			1
dr @entity5 told her that @entity1 's daughter , @entity85 , had released a statement			1
' rape is a serious allegation , and it is supposed to be taken very seriously , but so is falsely accusing someone , ' it read			0

that should also happen the person that has wrongfully accused an innocent victim			2

anger : @entity4 , left , spoke to dr @entity5 with other women who say they were drugged and raped by @entity1 , including @entity107 ( right ) , who said to @entity1 and his wife : ' shame on you , shame on you ! ' ' so where 's that time ? all of us just blacked out miraculously , because we were around @entity1 from the shock of him being a star ? i mean honestly			1
' although she had initially not wanted to speak out , she said she decided to come forward after model @entity115 accused @entity1 of raping her			1

' a body knows when it ’s raped , ' @entity125 said on the show			0
' you not only rape physically but you are raped emotionally			0
and your spirit is gone forever			0

we all have that same thing in common			2
' @entity107 added : ' hopefully it 'll dissipate and i do n't have to carry the shame anymore			0
' she also had a message for @entity28 and his wife , @entity139 , who has stood by her husband and slammed the media coverage of ' rumors ' about her husband			0
' shame on you shame , shame on you , shame on you , ' @entity107 said			0
standing by her man : @entity139 , pictured with her husband in november , broke her silence this week to slam the media 's coverage of the accusations , suggesting it was @entity1 who was the real victim the show will air on friday , and they will be joined by attorney @entity156 and @entity157 , a former @entity159 bunny who maintains he is a respectful man and friend			2
@entity1 has denied any wrongdoing and no criminal charges have ever been brought - but in 2006 , he did settle a civil lawsuit with a woman who claimed he drugged and raped her in 2004			1
earlier this week , @entity139 broke her silence			0
she compared the media 's handling of the reports to @entity171 's botched coverage of the @entity173 rape scandal			0
' there appears to be no vetting of my husband 's accusers before stories are published or aired , ' she said			0
' an accusation is published , and immediately goes viral ... none of us will ever want to be in the position of attacking a victim			0
but the question should be asked - who is the victim ? '			2
