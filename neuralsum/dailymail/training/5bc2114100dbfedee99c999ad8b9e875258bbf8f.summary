three black comediennes will take the @entity2 stage at some point today to fight for a cast member position opening up this january - and one of them is a noted critic of the show			1
@entity2 creator @entity8 decided to break tradition and hire new talent midseason after facing criticism that the sketch - comedy show lacked diversity in its sixth year without a black female cast member			1
a source at the show revelealed to the @entity17 that @entity19 winner @entity18 , stand - up comic @entity20 and sketch comic @entity21 were the three women who made the cut for today 's auditions			1
all three women are alumnae of the @entity27 - an improv troupe founded by @entity2 alum @entity28			1
they made the cut after performing in a showcase in @entity30 on december 2			2
@entity21 pointed to the show hosted by @entity44 in november , saying perhaps it was the white male dominated @entity2 writing room that was n't ready to handle black female characters			1
' the @entity2 writers showed what they could do with a " read " black actress : pigeonhole her			1
they took an @entity53 - nominated actress and made her play a nagging firlfriend ; a sassy eye - rolling assistant ; and a rage - filled @entity57 beauty queen , ' @entity21 wrote			1
' why ca n't they create interesting and funny characters ourside race ? how long will it take the @entity2 writers to learn that black is not a punch line ? ' outspoken : @entity21 criticized the show 's writers in an essay in november , saying the characters they wrote for the @entity44 show relied on black female stereotypes she continues to say that while she rarely finds black women playing outside stereotypes on tv , her fellow comediennes a creating new ' awkward ' , ' sophisticated ' , and ' hilarious ' black female charaters on @entity75			1
' if snl is n't finding great black female talent , maybe it 's because the characters we want to play do n't fall in lilve with the caricatures they 're used to seeing			1
' @entity21 stated she does n't believe there should be some sort of affirmative action diversity quota put on the writer 's room , but that the white - male dominated group is becoming a crutch for @entity2			1
' if a group of white men are dictating what is being said , then there are so many different perspectives missing from the discussion , ' she said			0
' a relic of the comedy community , the @entity2 writers ' room needs to be more diverse for the sake of being true to the art form and the audience			2
rumors that a new player might be added to the cast started last week , when @entity106 reported that auditions were held earlier in the month at the @entity109 theater for black female comediennes in @entity111			1
man behind the curtain : @entity8 previously said that hiring a black actress was on the show 's to do list the rumor was confirmed by @entity2 's creator and producer @entity8 who told the @entity119 last thursday that a black female cast member will join the cast in january - the first time @entity8 can remember adding a cast member mid-season			1
' @entity124 told we 've seen about 25 people , ' @entity8 told the @entity119			2
' a lot of people we saw are really good			0
hopefully we 'll come out of the process well			0
' @entity8 added that as many as two of the nine that made it to the final round could make it onto the cast in january			1
but he says he does n't want to add too many women since the cast already has five			2
right now , the snl cast consists of five men and five women , with one female and six male featured players			1
@entity8 also revealed that he had vetted two black female players when he was initially hiring for the current season this past fall			1
he saw the two women during a performance in @entity147 , but their performances were n't as strong when they were invited to @entity30 for the final auditions			1
' then when the deck got reshuffled and as we premiered we realized , it looks a different way , ' he said			0
that 's when he started the unusual process of searching for a new cast member mid-season			0
@entity8 says he ca n't remember ever adding a new cast member in the middle of the season , but says he has added players in march or april to get them into the last episodes of the season			1
four black women : in its nearly 40 years on the air , @entity2 has hired just four black women			1
the first was @entity167 , right , and @entity168 , left , spent the 1985 - 86 season on the show no more : after @entity172 , left , left the cast in 1995 , there would n't be another black woman until @entity175 in 2000			1
@entity176 left in 2007 and there has n't been a black woman on the show since while many have criticized the show for not having anyone to play prominent black females like first lady @entity184 , @entity185 or @entity186 , @entity8 says that has nothing to do with his hiring decision			1
' that 's a weird sort of way of looking at it because you do n't judge comedy that way			0
versatility is what we look for			0
' this will be the first time since 2007 that @entity2 has had a woman of @entity203 - @entity202 heritage on the show			2
the two current black cast members - @entity39 and @entity206 - were the ones to spurn the criticism this fall as they felt it was inappropriate that all impersonations of prominent black women meant that they would have to dress in drag			1
as a result , there have been no sketches on the weekly program featuring first lady @entity184 since @entity175 left the cast in 2007			0
' snl ' has had just four black women in its regular troupe since premiering in 1975 , including @entity176 who is biracial			2
done : cast member @entity39 announced this season that he will no longer dress in drag to play black women			2
he had played the likes of @entity226 ( right ) , @entity227 and @entity228 in the past ' it 's not like it 's not a priority for us , ' @entity8 said in an interview with the @entity234 in early november			2
i 'm sure it will happen			0
' news of the invitation - only auditions that have been taking place in @entity111 and @entity147 broke when pictures of the prospective candidates backstage hit the internet			2
actress @entity244 said she was ' honored ' to be one of the 11 black comediennes asked to audition on about two days notice in that instance			2
' it was an awesome opportunity even though it was such short notice but , if you stay ready you ai n't got ta get ready and we were ready ! , ' she told @entity251			0
' i can share that we all entered the @entity109 theater backstage having no idea what to expect			0
i had no clue who was apart of the showcase			0
of course my comedienne friends ( @entity259 , @entity260 and @entity261 ) were there			0
and some talented ladies in sketch comedy were there that i had never met , ' she said			0
it 's happening : @entity2 's creator @entity8 confirmed that a new black female comedienne will be added to the cast this january following reports that a ' secret ' audition were held earlier this month in @entity111 ( those asked to audition pictured ) @entity273 , @entity274 , @entity275 , @entity276 , @entity277 , @entity278 and @entity279 also auditioned according to @entity280			1
' we were all very supportive of each other and there was no sense of competition or pettiness , ' ms @entity244 said			0
' we were just happy that some new black women in comedy were being considered and given a shot			0
we even held hands prayed after the showcase			0
the show was also sold out			0
it was packed to the max. ' @entity296 says she was invited to audition last summer , but was filming a television show and was n't able to perform			0
one of the comediennes who auditioned in @entity302 - had a fan on the inside , as @entity206 has publicly lobbied for her to get one of the coveted spots			0
supporter : cast member @entity206 ( left ) has named @entity307 ( right ) as someone he would like to see join the cast ' why do i think she should be on the show ? because she 's black first of all , and she 's really talented			2
she needs to be on @entity2			0
and i believe they need to follow up with it like they said they were going to do last year , ' @entity206 told @entity317			0
the timing of the announcement comes not only as a result of the criticism but also due to the high - profile departure of cast member and head @entity323 , who will leave in the @entity325 to host @entity326 when @entity327 goes to @entity328 .			0

@entity8 revealed thursday that at least one new black female actress will join the cast of @entity2 in january
final auditions on the snl stage in @entity30 were *scheduled* for today
@entity337 winner @entity18 , stand - up comic @entity20 and sketch - comic @entity21 are the finalists
