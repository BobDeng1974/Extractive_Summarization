response : @entity1 took to @entity2 to dismiss claims that there are plans to allow ambulance waiting times to double as ‘ scaremongering ’ @entity1 was accused of ‘ moving the goalposts ’ yesterday as a row erupted over plans to allow ambulance response times to more than double			1
the health secretary described the claims as ‘ scaremongering ’ , but a leaked @entity16 memo revealed proposals to increase maximum permissible waiting times for some serious calls from eight to 19 minutes			1
senior doctors said the plans ‘ risked lives ’ and @entity23 accused mr @entity1 of making a ‘ panic decision ’ in the face of a winter @entity16 crisis			1
but last night it emerged that @entity23 and the @entity28 had been informed of the plans up to three months ago and had not raised any objections			1
the @entity31 , which wrote the document , said in a statement it was ‘ surprised ’ by the reaction			2
it said that ‘ over the last three months the principles of what we are proposing and the benefits for patients that we envisage have been shared with @entity23 , @entity41 and @entity42 @entity28 and we have received no negative feedback on the thrust of those principles ’			1
the statement added : ‘ at this stage , these are only proposals and they will not be formally approved until @entity49 and the secretary of state are convinced … that they are clinically safe and that they offer better care for our patients			1
’ the @entity31 pointed out that half of call - outs are categorised as ‘ life - threatening ’ , but only one in ten actually are			2
bosses believe relaxing targets – so the eight - minute response time only applies to these calls – would mean more lives could be saved			1
the ambulance service in @entity49 and @entity64 is under severe strain and has consistently missed response time targets for the most serious cases since april			1
in some regions the volume of calls is 15 per cent higher compared with last year officials blame an increasing tendency of patients to dial 999 first instead of trying to arrange an appointment with a gp			2
facing the strain : the ambulance service in @entity49 and @entity64 is under severe strain and has consistently missed response time targets for the most serious cases since april			2
above , file image of ambulance workers the most serious ambulance calls are categorised as either @entity80 , such as cardiac arrests , or red 2 , which are slightly less serious but still life - threatening , including strokes , breathing difficulties or blood clots			2
currently , ambulances have to respond to both @entity87 and @entity89 call - outs within eight minutes			0
but the leaked document suggested raising the waiting time for some @entity89 call - outs to 19 minutes			2
it was drawn up by the @entity31 , dated last monday , and clearly stated that the proposals had been ‘ approved by the @entity50 ’			0
it added that the target date for implementing the proposals was the first week of january			0
row : shadow health secretary @entity96 , above , said plans suggest @entity1 ’s solution to the @entity100 crisis is to ‘ move the goalposts ’ however , mr @entity1 took to @entity2 to dismiss the claims as ‘ scaremongering ’ , saying he ‘ categorically refutes ’ them			1
he wrote : ‘ no plans to double ambulance waiting times , and there never have been			1
’ but one ambulance service director , who asked not to be named , told @entity109 : ‘ this is being done for political expediency rather than patient safety … with the full blessing of @entity1			1
this is being pushed through with limited consultation with the chief executives and the health service as a whole			2
’ the document states that a small proportion of the most serious @entity89 calls would be upgraded to @entity87			0
of the remaining @entity89 cases , just under half would keep the eight - minute target – but would be given an extra three minutes before the clock started , to help staff classify the call			0
all other @entity87 2 cases would have a 19 - minute target , and the clock would not start until three minutes after the call is received			0
yesterday professor @entity132 , @entity16 national director for acute care , said ‘ nothing had been agreed ’ – and that the plans would not take effect next month			1
he told @entity137 ’s @entity138 : ‘ if it is not clinically sound then it is not going to progress			0
’ shadow health secretary @entity96 said the plans suggest @entity1 ’s solution to the @entity100 crisis is to ‘ give up and move the goalposts ’			1
he added : ‘ people will struggle to understand how , in the middle of a crisis , it makes sense for the government to make a panic decision to relax 999 standards and leave patients waiting even longer			1
’ mr @entity96 has written to the health secretary asking why the measures were not disclosed to @entity155 days after he signed them off			1
professor sir @entity156 , the government ’s former adviser on heart disease , said the plans were ‘ going down a very dangerous path , and will risk lives … it ’s an admission of defeat ’			2

‘ gp services need to keep up with 21st - century lifestyles , ’ she said			0
‘ with many younger adults out at work , it can be difficult for them to get an appointment with a gp , particularly at a convenient time			0
as a result , some people are struggling to access the medical advice they need			0
