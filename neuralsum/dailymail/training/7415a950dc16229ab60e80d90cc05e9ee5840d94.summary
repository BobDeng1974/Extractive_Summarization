leaked documents from the @entity1 recently revealed a covert usb stick that could be used to target secure , offline networks			1
but the device costs a staggering $ 20,000 ( £ 13,200 )			1
now , a team of hackers has created its own version of the surveillance kit using a cheap circuit board and other parts that total just $ 20 ( £ 13 )			1
it features a radio - frequency implant inside a usb stick ( stock image pictured ) , alongside a circuit board , transceiver and a cover			1
it can be connected to a network and potentially used to attack the pc			0
the parts total around $ 20 ( £ 13 ) called @entity13 , the project was demonstrated at the @entity28 hacking convention in @entity30 at the weekend			1
last year , @entity32 computer scientists proved that malware can travel between machines using sound waves that are inaudible to unsuspecting humans			0
using built - in microphones and speakers in laptops , the researchers managed to transmit passwords and small amounts of data between machines 65ft ( 19 metres ) away from each other			2
they came up with a hack using sound to steal data from protected machines and suggested that noise could be used to pass data between target computers and the ‘ hacker ’ machine			0
the researchers chose to use sounds that are too high pitched for humans to hear and harnessed the microphone and speakers in a @entity59 computer to transmit keystrokes from one computer to another			0
the @entity1 hardware it is based on was dubbed @entity65 - i. it lets hackers launch a man in the middle - style attack by plugging into a keyboard or mouse , for example , and installing malware on computers			1
the device was designed to also be able to control the malware , even on so - called ‘ airgapped ’ computers			2
an air - gap or air wall is a network security measure			2
the gaps were designed to make sure secure computer networks are physically isolated from unsecured networks , such as the internet or a local area network			0
@entity13 was set up deliberately to see if a hobbyist could create something similar to @entity65 - 1 , in terms of size and functions			2
it is part of a wider project called the @entity92 that attempts to recreate @entity1 surveillance tools			1
the project was presented at the convention by wireless security researcher @entity96 , with collaborators @entity98 and @entity100			0
the tool features a processor with a built - in radio on a circuit board that fits inside a moulded usb plug			1
the @entity13 project was inspired by a covert stick called @entity108 that appeared in recently leaked @entity1 documents ( pictured ) and cost $ 20,000 ( £ 13,200 ) each			1
it is part of a wider project called the @entity92 that attempts to recreate @entity1 surveillance tools an air - gap or air wall is a network security measure			1
it was designed to make sure secure computer networks are physically isolated from unsecured networks , such as the internet or a local area network			0
researchers from @entity121 recently designed computer software that logs keystrokes			2
this software transmits strokes via @entity127 radio signals generated by the pc 's graphics card			0
the data is picked up by a nearby mobile , equipped to pick up radio signals			0
this can be done without being detected by the user , but does rely on the software being installed on the computer in the first place			0
since @entity127 radio signals travel over long distances , the receiver could be placed in another building			0
the circuit board is custom printed and costs $ 1.50 ( 99p ) to make			1
the microcontroller is made by @entity144 , with a radio - frequency transceiver that costs around $ 4 ( £ 2.65 )			1
other parts include a 3d - printed injection mould and plastic cover			2
at the moment , @entity13 has the potential to connect and ‘ sniff ’ the network , and the next step is to make it attack the computer its connected to			2
‘ usb implants were among the most talked about gadgets in the @entity1 catalogue after it leaked last year , ’ said the researchers			1
‘ concealed in cables and connectors , these devices appear to be designed primarily to provide covert communication channels to malware operating on a host computer			0
‘ secondarily it seems that they could be used to implement usb attacks or to monitor connected usb devices			0
‘ [ @entity170 ] demonstrate tools we 've built for the same capabilities			0

@entity1 uses a covert surveillance device in a usb stick called @entity108
leaked documents recently revealed the spy tool costs $ 20,000 ( £ 13,200 )
a team of hackers has created its own version of the surveillance kit
they put a radio - frequency implant inside a usb stick
this *involved* a circuit board , transceiver and a cover - totalling $ 20 ( £ 13 )
called @entity13 , the team demonstrated it at @entity15 , @entity30
