by @entity0 published : 08:14 est , 28 february 2014 @entity2 : 09:42 est , 28 february 2014 she was still grieving for the twin babies she had lost just weeks before			2
so @entity5 could n't believe the news when doctors confirmed she was pregnant again - with twins			2
the 32 - year - old , from @entity10 , had been devastated when her twins @entity11 and @entity13 , born at just 23 weeks , had died			1
@entity5 amazed doctors by conceiving two sets of twins in a year			2
the first set , @entity11 and @entity13 , died when born at 23 weeks			1
just two months later she learned she was expecting @entity18 and @entity19 ( pictured ) but just over two months later , she received the wonderful news that she was pregnant again - and there were two heartbeats			1
she added that while she was ' overjoyed when the babies were born healthy , ' she still felt an emptiness for the children she had lost			1
she has now given birth to another set of twins - @entity19			2
ms @entity5 said : ‘ it ’s as if @entity11 and @entity13 have been sent back to me			2
i ca n’t believe how i can be so blessed to have another two and be able to take them home with me			0
‘ everyone , even the doctors , were shocked at me having two sets of twins in less than a year			0
it was definitely meant to be that i was given @entity19			0
’ ms @entity5 suffered complications almost as soon she found out she was pregnant in april 2012 and just 23 weeks into her pregnancy she was rushed to hospital and gave birth			1
@entity18 ( pictured ) and @entity19 were born in july 2013 and were both healthy enough to go home within a few days @entity41 and @entity42 were born at the @entity43 in @entity44			1
@entity11 came into the world at 2.50am weighing just 9oz , while @entity13 was born 10 minutes later and weighed 1lb			1
the pair - who ms @entity5 says could have fitted into the palm of her hand - were taken to the @entity50 , in @entity51 , and placed on ventilators			0
but @entity11 lost her fight eight hours after she was born and @entity13 battled on for just a few more hours before dying at 4.30pm on the same day			2
former delivery driver ms @entity5 , who has two older children , @entity54 , seven , and four - year - old @entity55 , said her world came crashing down after their deaths			0
@entity19 was not breathing when he was born so he had to spend five days in hospital before going home she said : ‘ i felt like i was looking in on someone else and it was n’t me			2
i ’d had two babies , but i was going home with none			0
‘ none of it seemed real			0
i was empty , my stomach was empty , but yet i had nothing			0
i still have n’t got over that and i do n’t expect i ever will			0
’ but just nine weeks later ms @entity5 went from despair to happiness when she discovered that she was pregnant again - with twins			1
and unlike her pregnancy with @entity11 and @entity13 , she had no health problems and went into labour at a safer 36 weeks			0
after a @entity78 birth , ms @entity5 delivered @entity19 and @entity18 on july 22 last year at 4.17pm			1
although @entity19 was not breathing when he was born , doctors worked on him and he took his first breath six minutes later			0
ms @entity5 said : ' when [ @entity19 and @entity18 ] were born i was over the moon , but at the same time i was still grieving for @entity11 and @entity13			1
but even though they have filled the void , i 'll still always feel an emptiness for the two i lost ' @entity18 was taken home two days after her birth and @entity19 came home five days later , after being looked after in the special care baby unit			1
ms @entity5 , who has since split from the babies ’ father , said seven months on , both babies are healthy and @entity19 is ‘ really stern and serious ’ and @entity18 is ‘ full of smiles ’			1
ms @entity5 said : ‘ it ’s hard to explain but when they were born i was over the moon , but at the same time i was still grieving for @entity11 and @entity13			1
‘ but even though they have filled the void , i ’ll still always feel an emptiness for the two i lost , especially when i go to the cemetery			0
‘ i know their souls are with us though			0
they can never be replaced			0

@entity5 , 32 , lost her first set of twins , @entity11 and @entity42 , when they were born at just 23 weeks , each weighing about 1lb
two months later she learned she was pregnant with twins again
@entity19 and @entity18 , now seven months , were born healthy in july
