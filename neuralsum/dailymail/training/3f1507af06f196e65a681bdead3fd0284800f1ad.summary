by @entity0 in @entity1 published : 05:24 est , 18 september 2013 updated : 07:22 est , 18 september 2013 @entity2 has revealed she still wants to meet the parents of murdered @entity4 and visit her grave - just days before a fresh trial against her begins			1
@entity7 , 26 , spoke out in an interview with @entity10 glossy weekly @entity9 in which she again stressed her innocence and insisted that refusing to show up at the hearing was not a ' admission of guilt '			1
' the @entity15 was initially convicted of murdering and sexually assaulting @entity4 with her then boyfriend @entity16 , 29 , in 2009			1
' @entity17 of pain ' : @entity2 said an ' abyss of pain ' stands between her and @entity4 's family but she one day wants to visit the grave of her murdered friend with @entity4 's parents two years later they were sensationally cleared but last @entity26 's @entity25 ordered a fresh trial which is due to begin in less than two weeks			1
in her interview with @entity29 , @entity7 spoke in front of a camera on the side of a hill overlooking her home town of @entity36 , dressed in a blue t shirt , ear rings and wearing little make up she appeared tense as she answered questions under a steel grey sky			1
she said : ' contact the @entity42 ? i have n't yet tried			2
there is this abyss of pain that separates us , that has grown during the trial , i have n't had the courage to cross it			1
millions of times i 've thought about it and millions of times in my own way i have n't done it because i am scared that they will think it a legal strategy or a media one			2
' i do n't want them to think of me like that			2
i read what they said about the trial , about @entity4			1
i 've read @entity64 's ( @entity4 's father ) book			1
i was absorbed and annihilated by the trial , by prison			2
' i still do n't have the strength to cry , to digest the loss of @entity4			1
i would like to meet them , one day i would like to go with them to the grave of my friend			1
hitting back : @entity16 , who was accused of murdering @entity4 , says the police 's handling of his case was ' incompetent '			1
he claims he was blackmailed into framing @entity2 for the crime accused : @entity16 says he refused to comply with what police were suggesting because of his ' fondness ' for @entity7 , pictured , and he wrote a letter from his prison cell to his family insisting he would stand by her close : @entity2 and @entity16 can be seen kissing in @entity26 shortly after they had been named as suspects in the murder of @entity86 ' i do n't want to impose myself on their pain , i hope that i can meet them halfway , even if for now it is too early , they still think i am guilty and that is something that hurts me a great deal			1
' @entity4 was found semi naked and with her throat cut in her bedroom of the house that she shared with @entity7 and two @entity10 woman , in @entity1 in november 2007			1
@entity7 and her then boyfriend @entity16 were arrested just days later and charged with murdering and sexually assaulting the student from @entity104 , @entity105 , who had only been in @entity26 for two months when she died			1
tragic : @entity4 , 21 , was killed in 2007			1
@entity16 and @entity7 were both convicted of her murder in 2009 and then cleared their first trial ended in 2009 with @entity7 being given 26 years jail , while @entity16 , got 25 years - however in 2011 an appeal court overturned the verdict after it emerged that forensic police had bungled in gathering the evidence against them and as a result it was considered flawed and unreliable			1
in march @entity26 's @entity25 rejected that ruling and ordered a fresh trial which will begin in @entity119 and @entity7 explained why she would not be going			1
' i am trying to rebuild my life			2
i have only one , i can not risk exposing it to danger and another injustice			1
i do n't have the money to go back to @entity26			2
' not going back is an admission of my innocence , it is not an admission of guilt			2
there is always the fear of another unjust verdict			2
' i still have faith in @entity10 justice			2
that 's why i am still here fighting			1
there is no trace of me in that room , in the room where my friend was killed			0
it is impossosble that i could have taken part in such a situation and not exist in that room , that is the proof of my innocence which has been ignored			0
' the proof of innocence is the fact that there is no trace of me in that room , i would ask anyone to answer logically , to prove how you can take part in a murder , an orgy , where i supposedly have the murder weapon in my hand and not leave a trace			0
' this is proof of my innocence and it is being ignored but i have faith that if people look at this logically without any prejudice they will see i had nothing to do with this			0
' they have robbed me of four years of my life , everything that i could say i said in a hundred court hearings , everything that i possessed , happiness , ingenuity , faith in others , was taken away			0
i was a little girl when they threw me in jail - now i feel as if i am 40 years older than i am			0
' victim : the pair were found guilty in december 2009 of murdering @entity4 but after an 11 - month appeal both convictions were thrown out in october 2011 @entity7 insisted : ' i did not kill @entity4			1
i did not kill my friend and i even thought about going to @entity119 because it drives me mad to think that someone can puff out their chest and point their finger at my empty chair and stain me with a crime that i did n't commit			1
' i can understand that you can try and build up an allegation , a conviction , even if there is no damning proof and no motive but they have really exaggerated against me			0
' @entity7 also revealed how she had been to see a psychologist and said : ' i 've been twice , my mother insisted on it			1
i did n't want to go because i had been seen by the psychologists in jail and i ca n't say they helped much , they just wanted to fill me with anti depressants			0
' the first time i went i could n't say a word			0
the second time i spoke for 15 minutes solid and at the end i had a panic attack			0
i could n't and i still ca n't , get rid of all the sadness and of the sensation of feeling trapped			0
fear : @entity16 , left , said his former girlfriend @entity2 , right , was ' out of contol ' after their arrest ' i feel like one of those animals that is hunted by a bigger animal			0
after i was cleared i thought everything would be ok , that things would have returned to what they were like before , happy , carefree			2
i tried to convince myself that everything was going well , that it was just a question of time and that the sadness would pass			0
' but it did n't pass , the sadness went on , the months slipped past and i was still freaked out , exhausted			0
now i have accepted this limbo , even if perhaps i will go back to the psychologist - not even writing my book cured me			0
' november , 2007 - @entity4 is found dead in @entity1 , @entity233 , 2008 - @entity4 convicted of sexually assaulting and murdering @entity234 2009 - @entity2 and @entity16 found guilty of murdering miss @entity86			1
miss @entity2 sentenced to 26 years in prison and mr @entity16 to 25			0
october 2011 - after an 11 - month appeal both convictions were thrown @entity238 2013 - @entity26 â€™s highest criminal court ruled that an appeals court must re-hear the case against miss @entity2 and mr @entity16 she added : ' i can understand the investigators			0
they were under pressure , they had to find the guilty ones quickly			2
on my part they got a rapid and wrong idea from my behaviour , my presumed coldness and they decided that i had something to do with the murder , they did n't know exactly what but in some way i was involved , i was guilty and i deserved jail			2
' i 'm very angry with the prosecutor @entity259 and the investigators but i will forgive them instantly if they admit their mistake			0
' they do n't have to say sorry , just that they regret it			0
i do n't want revenge			0
i would feel such a relief if @entity259 admitted he made a mistake			0
to say that i was innocent would signify that not only had a mistake been made but a mistake had been made on top of another and another to cover up a whole bunch of mistakes			0
' the investigators , the judges , do n't want to admit this to themselves and to the public ... it 's all a question of reputation but justice is made up of human beings and human beings can make mistakes			2
' @entity7 also spoke of @entity16 in her interview and confirmed what he had told the magazine last week that she was inexperienced in bed and said : ' certainly i would have preferred him to protect my privacy			1
i do all i can to be close to him , we speak all the time , i encourage him , i tell th whole world that he is innocent			0
' he knows that we have lived through a nightmare			0
he knows that i can count on him and he can count on me			0
how can going back help him ? he is suffering more than me in all this - the unjustified conviction , they media and the prosecution it 's all being carried out by his country , his people but i have no power			2
i am simply his friend , a proud friend			0
' the @entity64 family lawyer has slammed @entity7 and @entity16 's decision not to attend the fresh trial which is expected to last until november with a verdict due by the end of the year			1
drifter @entity4 , 26 , was convicted of murdering and sexual assaulting @entity4 in 2008 after a fast track trial and originally sentenced to 30 years , this was later reduced to sixteen and he could be freed on parole by 2016			1
