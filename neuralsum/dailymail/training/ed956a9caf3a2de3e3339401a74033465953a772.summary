they are a stunning insight into an almost alien world			0
now researchers have unveiled incredible new images which reveal the smooth underside of icebergs			2
the stunning patterns reveal centuries of material from the @entity11 's oceans			2
salt water is much denser than fresh water , causing icebergs to float			2
as they melt in the ocean , their weight distribution can change , causing some icebergs to flip over completely			2
however , this is an extremely rare occurrence as 90 per cent of any iceberg is below the surface , meaning the balance is rarely in favour of a complete flip			1
the images , from the @entity33 , show an overturned iceberg with some penguins on top			1
' it contains centuries of windblown sediments and minerals , ' said @entity41 , which published the images			1
' it really is the stuff of dreams			0
' the pictures were taken in @entity46 , a region in the western @entity47 where a large concentration of icebergs move in a north - northeast direction following the clockwise circulation around the @entity47 gyre			1
large old icebergs contain centuries of windblown sediment and minerals , visible as layers when they roll over			1
scientists have analysed the relationship between iron and nutrients contained in these icebergs and the organic carbon production that is released into the ecosystem			2

when a flip does occur , the consequences can be devastating			0
for instance , larger iceberg flips can trigger tsunamis that can damage nearby ships			1
their undersides can vary in colour from blue to green , and they will stay that colour for the rest of their lives			0
it is such a stunning colour because ice absorbs red light , and reflects blue			0

not all icebergs are white : this photograph by @entity106 proves that their undersides can come in spectacular shades of colours last month while on an expedition to @entity111 , @entity106 was stunned when he spotted an ' alien ' blue iceberg floating across the landscape			1
unlike the icebergs around it , the surreal sleeping beast was completely free of snow and debris , revealing a polished azure surface			1
what mr @entity106 witnessed in @entity121 was an incredibly rare phenomenon ; a flipped iceberg caused by an imbalance in frozen water			1
' @entity111 is one of those places where you can point the camera in any direction and come away with something spectacular , ' mr @entity106 told @entity132			0
' typically icebergs are white , with blue accents near the water - this by contrast was alien - blue			0
more like a galactic artefact than anything terrestrial			0
' the @entity141 - based photographer added that the glacier was likely to be extremely old , with the blue being ' the glacial equivalent of aging white hairs			0
' experts say the iceberg could be anything from tens to hundreds of thousands of years in age			0

around 90 per cent of any iceberg is below the surface , making iceberg flips an uncommon occurrence these stunning images were taken while mr @entity106 was travelling through the @entity121 between the southern tip of @entity169 at @entity170 , @entity171 and the @entity172 of @entity111 using his @entity173 and a 16 - 35mm f / 2.8 lens , mr @entity106 was able to capture some incredible views of the iceberg and its surroundings			1

@entity196 , a glacial geophysicist at the @entity197 told i100.co.uk he had rarely seen an image of a flipped iceberg that was so stunning			0
while it is difficult to tell its scale , mr @entity196 suspects it is reasonably small â€“ much smaller than those than can reach up to eight miles long			0
this beautiful images was taken from @entity206			0
the back of @entity206 is a glacial face , which regularly calves ice into the bay using a @entity173 and 16 - 35mm f / 2.8 lens , mr @entity106 was able to capture some incredible views of the iceberg and its surroundings a seal relaxed in @entity206			0
the area is southeast of @entity217 in @entity218 , along the west coast of @entity220 , @entity111 ' [ it ] is one of those places where you can point the camera in any direction and come away with something spectacular ' , said mr @entity106			0
