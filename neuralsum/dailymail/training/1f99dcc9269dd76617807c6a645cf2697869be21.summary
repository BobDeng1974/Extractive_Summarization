ancient graffiti belonging to a relative of @entity2 has been discovered etched into the wall of @entity5 's prison			1

@entity9 was captured by the @entity11 after the @entity12 during the @entity13 and held prisoner at @entity5 in 1642			1
ancient graffiti belonging to a relative of @entity2 has been discovered etched into the wall of @entity5 's prison experts believe the 372 - year - old piece of writing scrawled on the walls by @entity9 proves how close @entity10 may have come to never being created if @entity2 's relative had been executed historians at @entity5 found the evidence of @entity21 s capture last month in a hidden room within the 900 - year - old tower the distant relative of @entity2 would have awaited execution in the castle ’s @entity26 but because he was a wealthy noble he narrowly avoided being beheaded			1
historians at @entity5 found the evidence of @entity21 ’s capture last month in a hidden room within the 900 - year - old tower			2
the faded lettering simply states ' @entity31 ' and is etched into an arrow slit within the prison ’s living quarters			1
experts say proof of the narrow escape shows how hundreds of iconic cartoons such @entity10 , @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41 were almost never brought to life			2
sleeping quarters in @entity44 at @entity5 where @entity2 's ancestor was held captive during the @entity13 living quarters in @entity44			1
@entity46 , head of historical interpretation at the castle , said : ' the name of @entity9 first appears in a room that was used to house prisoners during the @entity13 ' if @entity21 had been executed like most other prisoners the succession of the @entity2 line would never have existed			1
instead , it is believed @entity21 was sold back to his family for a hefty ransom to raise money for @entity60 ’s @entity59			2
@entity46 , head of historical interpretation at the castle , which was built by @entity63 in 1068 , said : ' the name of @entity9 first appears in a room that was used to house prisoners during the @entity13			1
' @entity44 is where only the most important visitors and prisoners were housed			0
' we had known of one name written into the wall with 1642 next to it but for a while we thought it was a joke			0
' but when we opened up the second room last month , which we think is a bedroom , as there was a second name of @entity21 with 1643 and one other name next to it we realised it was an authentic bit of graffiti			0
@entity2 and his wife with @entity10			1
experts say proof of @entity9 's narrow escape shows how hundreds of iconic cartoons such @entity10 , @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41 were almost never brought to life ' we have been looking into it and have confirmed it really was @entity21 by checking records			1
' we think he was here at the castle for a least six months to a year			2
' the names of other people with @entity21 in the tower certainly make it a very plausible case			0
' in fact , we came across a second piece of graffiti bearing @entity21 ’s name when we invited staff into some of the locked rooms for the first time so that they could have a look round			0
' all that we have been able to find out about him for sure is that he was called to muster for the @entity112 under @entity113 and that he is thought to have been one of the @entity115			0
' just think , had @entity21 been executed then it is a possibility that @entity10 might never have been born			0
' it is tremendously exciting when you make a find like this			0
' the rooms in which @entity2 ’s name have been found are securely locked , and will not be opened to the public in the foreseeable future , allowing for us to carry out more detective work			1
” mr @entity46 said that among the recently unearthed etchings on the tower ’s walls included a @entity129 which dates back to the 1400s			2
he added : ' it was done about the time of the @entity134 and @entity135			0
' we have no indication of who did it , but the engraving was painstakingly done and must have taken a very long time to finish			0
the distant relative of @entity2 would have awaited execution in the @entity143 s @entity26 but because he was a wealthy noble he narrowly avoided being beheaded it is believed @entity21 was sold back to his family for a hefty ransom to raise money for @entity60 ¿ s @entity59 in 1642 , civil war broke out between @entity113 and parliament and @entity151 forces laid siege to @entity5			1
but its defences had already been enhanced from january to may 1642 in preparation for the attack			0
the garden walls were raised , barricades mount artillery were constructed and gunpowder and wheels for two cannons were obtained - @entity151 forces failed in their attempt to take @entity5			2
the @entity12 in 1642 was a bloody clash close to @entity5 , which was a stronghold of @entity60 ’s @entity59			1
following the first pitched battle of the @entity13 – prisoners were held in @entity169 's and @entity168			2
this was not the first time that royalist prisoners had been held at @entity5			0
@entity21 was incarcerated in the castle by @entity174 in the fifteenth century			2
during the @entity176 prisoners were again held at the castle , including those from the @entity178 in 1651			2
' our best guess is that it was a guest of the @entity182 or a member of his family			0
' this part of the tower was reserved for important visitors , and whoever did it did n’t just inscribe the words of the prayer but carved out the stone around each letter			0
' it is a beautiful piece of work			0
' the 13th @entity182 , @entity195 , went out to @entity196 to fight for @entity197 , and it was he was responsible for the execution of @entity200			2
' he was in charge of the occupation in @entity203			0
' he put @entity204 on trial , signed her death warrant and arranged for her to be burned at the stake			0
' historical records show @entity21 had been fighting for ill - fated @entity113 but was captured after defeat at @entity12			1
the battle was a bloody clash close to @entity5 , which was a stronghold of @entity60 ’s @entity59			0
it is believed @entity21 survived the @entity13 as a letter dated in the 1660s between him and a lord has been found previously			0
the first @entity2 to arrive in @entity216 was @entity217 , from @entity218 in @entity196 , who came to the country with @entity63 in 1066			1
the family ’s surname became anglicised into @entity2 and they settled in a @entity223 village which was named @entity224 after them			1
@entity2 ’s great - grandfather , @entity226 , born in @entity227 in 1801 , was a descendant of @entity217 and the movie legend spent much of his life trying to trace his family , a recurrent theme in his films			1
when @entity2 came to @entity233 in the late 1940s , trying to piece together his family tree , he headed straight to @entity224			1
fading photographs taken in the village show @entity2 absorbed in the search for facts about his family name			1
he is pictured studying the tombs and gravestones and with the vicar , leafing through reams of ancient church registers .			0
