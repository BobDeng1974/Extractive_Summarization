' i do n't know why they did n't expedite them , but the thinking at the time was that it was not carbon monoxide , ' said chief police officer @entity45			2
@entity14 and @entity15 died on april 16 and although the state completed its toxicology report proving carbon monoxide killed her on june 1st , the delay ended up becoming deadly			1

deadly delay : @entity19 police were not given the result from toxicology tests that revealed carbon monoxide was to blame for ten days			1
it meant guests were still staying in the room and @entity22 , 11 , lost his life as a result toxicology tests have confirmed that the deaths of @entity68 , 73 , and @entity69 , 72 , were both due to carbon monoxide poisoning when @entity22 and his mother checked into the hotel , they did not know about the previous victims — nor did the police			1
the state said @entity77 dr. @entity7 had received the toxicology report the week before @entity22 died , but @entity7 failed to share those results with @entity8 authorities who could have shut down the motel			2
