she added : ‘ while struggling to come to terms with my own grief , my overriding concern has been for the security and wellbeing of @entity12 ’s children			0
‘ given the circumstances of @entity12 ’s murder , i have been surprised and disappointed that , despite repeated discreet approaches to @entity4 authorities , there has been no substantive or practical response			1
’ @entity4 law allows for a murder victim ’s family to be compensated by convicted killers			1
@entity49 , a lawyer who has represented @entity8 ’s family , said : ‘ talks started last year , but have not reached agreement			2
’ human rights lawyer @entity54 said : ‘ compensation should have been decided at the time of @entity8 ’s trial , but it appears it was not			2
‘ the government can compel the sale of assets to pay compensation			0
’ however , in such a sensitive case , the upper echelons of @entity10 would have to agree to any deal			0
‘ decisions about this case have to be made single - handedly by the @entity10 ’s top leaders , ’ said @entity65 , a law professor at @entity66			2
mrs @entity15 urged @entity4 to show ‘ decisiveness and compassion ’ to ‘ enable my family to achieve some kind of closure to our ongoing nightmare ’			1
she explained that , in the months after mr @entity12 's death , it became clear that he had not died from natural causes but was the victim of murder			0
' it also became clear that prominent @entity4 officials , including a member of the @entity10 's politburo and a number of senior policemen , were connected with the murder and involved in a systematic coverup , ' she said			1
after initially refusing to speak to the media to spare @entity4 authorities unnecessary embarrassment , their lack of any ' substantive or practical response ' had compelled her to break her silence , mrs @entity15 added			1
compensation : mr @entity12 's family is seeking compensation from his convicted killer @entity8 , seen with her husband @entity9 in 2007 a source close to mr @entity12 's @entity4 widow , @entity103 , said she had been pushing for compensation for herself and their two young children			1

@entity9 was sacked as @entity10 chief of the southwestern city of @entity110 last year when his wife was named as an official suspect in the november 2011 murder of @entity12 , a long - time friend of the couple who also helped their son , @entity115 , settle into study in @entity3			1
@entity9 is now awaiting trial on charges of corruption , taking bribes and of bending the law			0
the government originally implicated @entity9 in helping to cover up @entity12 's murder , but the legal indictment issued last month made no mention of that and it is unclear if the case will be included in his trial , likely to start this month			0
the @entity131 in @entity18 said it had passed on the family 's concerns about a lack of progress on the compensation request to the @entity4 government			1

' @entity4 's @entity140 did not respond to a request for comment			0
@entity4 law stipulates that victims of crime can seek compensation from those convicted of crimes , but does not lay out monetary benchmarks , which are generally decided by the courts depending on ability to pay and the nature of the crime			2
while assets ordered confiscated by courts can be used for compensation , @entity8 's verdict - as relayed by official state media - made no mention of asset confiscation			2
' compensation should have been decided upon at the time of @entity8 's trial , but it appears it was not			0
this is very strange , ' said @entity54 , a prominent human rights lawyer			0
' the government can compel the sale of assets to pay compensation , " ' which for murder cases was generally several hundred thousand yuan , he added			0
however , for such a sensitive case as this , the upper echelons of ruling @entity10 would have to sign off on a compensation deal , making any court involvement moot			0
' decisions about this case have to be made single - handedly by the @entity10 's top leaders			0
it 's not for a court or the government to decide , ' said @entity65 , a law professor at @entity66 who has closely followed @entity9 's downfall			0
