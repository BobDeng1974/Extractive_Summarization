the menopause is a b * * * h - as these three women will testify			1
but when it comes to your sex life , there ’s still a lot you can do to manage symptoms and come out on top - literally			1
@entity9 means there ’s no nasty periods to contend with			1
the kids have all moved out which means you can have sex when and where you want			1
there ’s no pregnancy worries and you ’re not afraid to ask for what you want			1
have the right attitude like everything in life , it ’s your attitude toward what ’s happening that counts the most			1
focus on the negatives - and i ’m not about to tell you there are n’t any , there are ! - and it can be a miserable experience			0
focus on solutions and the pluses and you 'll find you get a totally different result			0
women who have a healthy libido and are interested in keeping their sex life going , continue to have strong , healthy orgasms well into their 60s and 70s			1
perhaps because sex becomes less penetration focused , some women find they become multi-orgasmic post menopause			1
use a good moisturiser oestrogen levels drop during menopause			2
the result ? you ’re more prone to urinary tract infections and sex becomes uncomfortable because the walls of the vagina are thinner , less elastic and dryer			2
in real terms , this means while you might have enjoyed a passionate session in your 20s and 30s , it ’s more likely to have you screaming for all the wrong reasons post 50			2
happily , there ’s lots you can do to fix this one			0
@entity20 says that sex after menopause has plenty of benefits such as no period to contend with first up , invest in a vaginal moisturiser ( like @entity75 ) and use lots of lubricant during sex ( like @entity79 or @entity80 )			1
if that does n’t sort things , ask your gp about an oestrogen preparation to use locally ( like @entity85 or others available as a cream , pessary or vaginal ring )			0
consider @entity90 or natural alternatives opinion divides sharply on whether hormone replacement therapy is dangerous but a lot of the previous evidence against it has since been discredited			0
there are women who absolutely should n’t take @entity90 ( see your gp for a full analysis and search online for natural alternatives if you do n’t like the idea of taking synthetic hormones ) but lots can			0
and by @entity107 , does it make a difference			0
@entity90 keeps the genitals in better condition , increases desire and vaginal lubrication - all of which makes sex one hell of a lot more appealing ! reduce any health risks by taking the lowest dose you possibly can for the shortest period of time and try a gel , where you have more control over the dosage and can get it completely right for your personal needs			1
get your testosterone levels checked i wrote about this some time ago and got the fiery response i expected when advocating something unusual			0
but if your testosterone level is low - which can happen pre-menopause , as well as after because the levels fall with age - the urge for sex decreases substantially			1
replace what your body is n’t producing anymore and you could find your sex drive is back to what it was in your 30s			2
no desire for sex is the most common sexual menopausal symptom			2
a changing body shape , irritability and hot flushes do n’t exactly encourage women to rip their clothes off and race into the bedroom , but low testosterone is often the main culprit of a low or non-existent libido post-menopause			0
make an appointment with your gp to get your testosterone levels tested and take it from there			0
it ’s not just your sex life that may benefit from the gel : low testosterone levels have been associated with @entity162 ’s disease and other memory problems , heart disease and lowered bone density			1
rub a very small amount into the inside of your thigh or tops of your arms daily and you can get results within two weeks to a month			0
have sex that does n’t revolve around intercourse as you ’re struggling with your ageing dilemmas , he ’s struggling with his : a lot of men over 50 have problems getting or maintaining erections			2
this actually is n’t such a bad thing			0
if he takes longer to get aroused , it means you ’re both likely to spend longer on foreplay , generally upping the arousal level for women			0
oral sex , using vibrators , stroking - all become more enjoyable as a result			2
it ’s almost a shame that @entity193 means his @entity194 is fixed in most cases ! ( though the very good news is the pharmaceutical companies are finally making headway with a pill that ’s designed to boost desire in women			0
) even if he does have ‘ help ’ , sex is usually slower , more playful and revolves less around intercourse being the main event as we get older			1
whoever said ( your sex ) life begins at 50 , was damn right ! visit traceycox.com for @entity20 's books , views and products .			1
