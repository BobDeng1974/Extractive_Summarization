by @entity0 published : 05:28 est , 27 august 2013 updated : 19:35 est , 27 august 2013 as the name would suggest , it really can hurt a fly			0
but quite how that makes a fly - swat an offensive weapon – and one which a 33 - year - old mother needed @entity8 to buy – is a mystery			1
@entity10 visited her local hardware shop to buy the flimsy utensil when her kitchen became plagued with flies			1
' offensive weapon ' : @entity10 was eventually allowed to purchase the flimsy fly swat , deemed an ' offensive weapon ' at her local store , once she showed them @entity8 but she was stunned when the assistant refused to sell it to her unless she produced her driving licence or passport			1
the till - at @entity22 , in @entity23 , @entity24 - flashed up a warning sign , which indicated the fly swat was classified as an ' offensive weapon '			1
it means bosses considered the swat as dangerous as knives , fireworks , and lighters , which can only be sold legally to over 18s			0
mrs butcher - mum to two - year - old daughter @entity37 - said : ' the fly swat is a flimsy piece of plastic - certainly not an offensive weapon			1
' i ’d like to say it would n’t hurt a fly but that ’s probably the only thing it could come close to hurting			0
' i could swat somebody with it using all my strength and i doubt it would leave even the slightest of marks or bruises			0
' mrs @entity10 , who was recently made redundant from her project manager job at insurance firm @entity55 , took the request for @entity8 as a compliment			1
only once the 33 - year - old produced her passport did the shop attendant at the hardware store in @entity23 , @entity24 ( pictured ) , let her buy the swat she said : ' the number of flies has rocketed in the hot weather and unfortunately some of them have made their way from my garden into my kitchen			1
' i broke my old fly swat from overuse and went to the local shop to buy a replacement			2
' i only expected to be in the store for a couple of minutes but it turned into a bit of a drama at the checkout			0
' the shop assistant - who was in her fifties - told me a warning had flashed up telling her the swat was an " offensive weapon " and she should check the customer is over 18			1
' i thought she was having a laugh but she invited me round the other side of the till to show me the screen			0
this is not the first time shops have asked people for @entity8 when buying apparently innocent items			2
parents @entity94 , 19 , and @entity95 , 24 , had to prove their age when buying a @entity99 dvd from @entity100 ’s in @entity101 , @entity102			0
office worker @entity103 , 24 , was told she had to be aged over 21 to buy a cheese and onion quiche from @entity106 in @entity107 , @entity108			0
and writer @entity109 , 25 , was asked for @entity8 when buying a £ 1.19 pack of six teaspoons at @entity100 , in @entity111 , @entity112			2
anybody convicted of selling a knife to a person aged under 18 can be jailed for up to six months or fined up to £ 5,000			0
an offensive weapon is any article made or adapted for use for causing injury to the person , including knives and hidden knives			1
' we were both laughing and joking but she asked if i had my driving licence or passport on me , which i thought was ridiculous			2
' i ’m 33 years old and think i look my age but i did take her request as a compliment			0
in the end i had to get my driving licence out			0
' how can an innocent plastic fly swat be an offensive weapon ? what is the world coming to when you ca n’t buy a fly swat without producing @entity8 for it			1
' i can understand why you would ask for @entity8 when you were buying fireworks , alcohol , or a high voltage electric fly swat - but not a cheap plastic one			2
' the shop also sells spades and frying pans which would cause much more damage if i smacked somebody over the head with one of them			0
' @entity154 , the store ’s assistant manager , said : ' we think it might be an error on our till system			2
' sometimes it flashes up that something is an offensive weapon , but our guy who does the computers has been on his honeymoon for three weeks ' i ’m sure the member of staff asked for it in jest			1

@entity10 , 33 , was stunned when her local hardware shop asked for id
the *cashier* , in her *50s* , *insisted* swat was classified an ' offensive weapon '
mother was forced to show @entity8 despite both laughing about the situation
@entity180 said there must have been an error with the til system
