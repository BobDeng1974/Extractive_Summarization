as one of the largest children 's charities in the country , due to celebrate its 150th anniversary in 2016 , it has boasted a royal patron since 1902			2
the @entity3 and the @entity4 arrived together this afternoon in a chauffeur - driven @entity46			2
the sovereign was wearing a white , lavender and baby blue tweed coat by @entity51 and a @entity53 hat , while @entity27 was wearing a dove grey coat and dress by @entity56			1
the choice was particularly appropriate as mr @entity56 , a long time royal designer , is an ex @entity58 himself and is now vice president of the charity			1

i was very touched she chose to wear it today			0
' @entity82 is an unbelievable organisation that supported me throughout my childhood , my schooling and even helped me , financially , to start my own business at the age of 25			0
' we 've been together for 63 years			0
' @entity27 clearly agreed when she met him , saying : ' it 's a fantastic organisation , is n't it			2
' she and the @entity3 were shown round the new hi - tech headquarters , which has been built next to the original ' @entity90 ' created by @entity12 in 1873 to house a small group of vulnerable young women			1
stylish : the sovereign was wearing a white , lavender and baby blue tweed coat by @entity51 and a @entity53 hat although the organisation supports a wide variety of projects now , including those targeting the abuse and sexual exploitation of young children and others supporting young carers , the royals had asked for a briefing on another of its top priorities , the urgent need to recruit more adopters			0
around 4,000 children are put up for adoption each year but many prospective parents are put off by the notoriously bureaucratic and inefficient system that currently operates			0
the situation is even worse for children who are labelled ' hard to place ' , which includes youngsters from challenged backgrounds , siblings and older children			0
this year half of those on the @entity124 were brothers and sisters , with just 35 per cent of adopters willing to consider more than one child			0
and with the average age of adoption being three years and eight months , children aged over four are suffering too			0
the proportion of children being adopted is one in three when the child is four , but that plummets to one in 15 when the child turns five			0
race has also become an issue as a white child is three times more likely to be adopted than a black child , with the charity calling on more ethnic minority parents to come forward			0
before they left , the @entity3 and the @entity4 were given their baubles to hang on a tree in the hq 's foyer			1
' they are lovely , are n't they ? are we going to put them on the tree ? ' @entity3 asked her daughter - in - law			2

they had been made by @entity178 , eight , and @entity179 , seven , two sisters who are supported by the @entity12 's @entity181			1
