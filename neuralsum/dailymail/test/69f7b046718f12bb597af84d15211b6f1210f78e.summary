@entity0 has insisted he is enjoying the task of trying to turn @entity3 's season around despite all appearances			1
the 50 - year - old has suffered a torrid time since replacing @entity7 as head coach at @entity9 until at least the end of the season			1
@entity7 's former assistant has managed just two wins in 14 games in all competitions to date and has seen his side lose their last five @entity18 fixtures , a run which has allowed the chasing pack to close and threaten to drag the club into a shock relegation fight			1
@entity0 says that he 's enjoying his role at @entity3 and believes he 's getting the best out of the players that , coupled with fury over owner @entity29 's recruitment policy , has sparked calls for a mass boycott of sunday 's home clash with @entity33 , but @entity0 remains upbeat			1
he said with a smile : ' i 'm enjoying it - you might think it 's strange to say that			1
' the hardest thing is to pick yourself up after a defeat because you take it personally			0
but we are professionals and have to get on with it			0
i 'm quite a positive guy inside my head and i know i can do the job			2
i just need the tools			0
' we 've had setbacks , but you have got to deal with setbacks			0
it would be interesting to see if any manger or head coach had had this sort of situation in their career			0
it has been difficult , the facts are there			0
@entity3 have won just two games under @entity0 and fans are desperate for him not to be named manager ' but i 'm not a moaner and not making excuses			1
it 's a test of management how you deal with it			2
i think i 'm getting the best out of the group of players we have			2
' @entity0 's final comment may cause more than a few raised eyebrows with @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity81 each having emerged from their recent meetings with @entity3 having banked three points			1
injuries and ill - discipline - @entity86 and @entity88 are currently serving bans while skipper @entity90 is available at the weekend after having to sit out the last three games - have severely depleted a team which has been marooned on 35 points since the victory over @entity95 on february 28			2
@entity0 said : ' you ca n't afford to ease off in the @entity18			1
this is a difficult league and it 's difficult to win matches			0
you can win five in a row , lose five in a row - and we have to stop that			0
' @entity88 will be missing for the @entity33 game after getting sent off against @entity81			0
