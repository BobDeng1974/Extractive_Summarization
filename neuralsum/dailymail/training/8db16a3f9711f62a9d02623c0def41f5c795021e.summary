her ‘ no win , no fee ’ lawyers , @entity21 , settled the controversial case out of court in december , but last night it emerged that the @entity28 - based firm has claimed £ 57,589 for costs – a staggering 14 times the amount of mrs @entity2 ’s payout			1
campaigners last night condemned the fees , which will be paid by insurers of the owners of the former school where mrs @entity2 was injured			1
they said the fees were a ‘ sad ’ reflection of the burgeoning compensation culture in the @entity40 , which is having a knock - on effect for the general public in rising insurance premiums			1
@entity44 , the political director of the @entity45 ’ @entity46 , said : ‘ it is a sad truth of our absurd compensation culture that the only real winners are ambulance - chasing lawyers			1
’ a source close to the case added : ‘ the amount of costs these lawyers have put in for is absolutely outrageous			2
the @entity40 public is paying the price for these ridiculous bills in higher insurance premiums , which are going up and up and up			2
’ the incident happened in 2009 when the police community support officer , who serves with @entity62 , responded to reports of youths on the roof of four - storey @entity66 , a former school for the blind owned by property development firm @entity69			2

her decision to sue was condemned by her own police force when it was revealed in november			2
a spokesman for @entity92 said that they could not discuss details of the case because of confidentiality issues , but previously said it was ‘ crazy ’ that members of the public could be sued by police going about their duties			0
‘ risks can not be removed from every situation , ’ the spokesman said			0
‘ it ’s crazy that claims can be made by police officers in their line of work			0
the nature of their job is risky			0

often they are making more than the claimants are receiving in damages			0
’ miss @entity2 ’s solicitor , @entity131 , yesterday declined to comment			2
last year home secretary @entity132 criticised ‘ frivolous ’ claims being made by officers which she said were ‘ not the sort of attitude ’ they should exhibit			0
