@entity0 has been kind to sir @entity1			1
when , in 1970 , he found himself aimless and bereft following the break - up of the @entity4 , it was to a small farm in the country that he retreated			2
@entity7 lies on the @entity8 , that snake of land on the country ’s south - west coast stretching 30 miles from @entity13 in the north to the @entity15 ( headland ) of @entity8 in the south			1
the life @entity1 and his new wife @entity19 adopted there — simple , basic , shorn of luxury — proved his salvation			1
sir @entity1 cradles a lamb and cuddles his first wife @entity24 at @entity25 , @entity8 gradually , the drug - taking and heavy drinking threatening his well - being subsided and he again began to write music			1
happiness , once sought in the nightclubs of @entity31 and @entity32 , was to be found in patching up a leaky roof or shearing a sheep			2
in 1977 , @entity1 repaid his debt to his adopted home with an anthem			1
@entity15 was the first single to sell more than two million copies in @entity40 and established for good the musician ’s association with this remote strip of land			1
the ties between the surviving @entity4 and @entity40 are particularly moot given that this month the news broke that his former bandmate @entity47 is selling his rural 200 ‑ acre @entity49 estate and moving to the @entity50			2
@entity47 and his wife @entity51 , a former @entity52 , are set to make @entity53 their main home			2
@entity1 repaid his debt to his adopted home in 1977 by writing the song , @entity15 , which was the first single to sell more than two million copies yet what many people do not realise is that sir @entity1 , too , has quietly all but severed his connection with his own peaceful corner of the nation			1
since his arrival on the @entity15 in 1966 , he has expanded his estate into one of considerable size			1
and yet i have learned that he has not been seen by some locals who live there for half a decade			2
today , he is married to the @entity50 @entity70 , and prefers to divide his time between @entity31 and @entity32			2
‘ over the years , sir @entity1 has bought what used to be about seven different holdings , ’ says @entity72 , a farmer and neighbour on the @entity15			1
‘ the aim seems to have been to ensure privacy by purchasing neighbouring stretches of land			2
i would say the estate covers approximately 1,000 acres now			0
’ the couple with their three children during an extended stay at the family farm in @entity8 , @entity0 locals in the nearby fishing port of @entity87 have always harboured warm feelings towards the family for many years , the @entity1 family were allowed to enjoy their breaks at @entity7 in peace — there is no great mansion , only a modest farmhouse — and were rarely stopped in the street			1
locals in the nearby fishing port of @entity87 have always harboured warm feelings towards the @entity98 , and sir @entity1 is still respected widely in the area			1
but there is one sour note : the treatment new management meted out to two long - standing employees at @entity7 , one of whom found himself thrown out of his tied cottage and banished to a caravan after 20 years of faithful service			0
farmworker @entity110 and his partner @entity111 now inhabit a small corner of the former @entity114 station at @entity115 , a few miles from @entity7			0
the simple life that @entity1 and @entity19 adopted at the farm proved to be his salvation , far away from the nightclubs in @entity31 and @entity32 some eight months after being forced to quit their home on the @entity1 estate , @entity124 , they are still looking for permanent accommodation			1
estate manager @entity126 , who worked for sir @entity1 for some 30 years , was also dismissed in a shake - up of the estate which placed it on a more commercial footing under the supervision of a new manager			1
‘ i do n’t know why they were removed , ’ says mr @entity72 , whose family has farmed in the area for generations			0
‘ they were perfectly capable of doing what they were asked to do			0
they were told to manage the farm in the way they did			2
it was out of the blue			0
’ but what do the two men say about their treatment ? ‘ you wo n’t hear anything from them , ’ he says , making a zipping motion across his mouth			0
after @entity19 's death in 1998 , @entity1 's visits to the @entity15 became much less frequent down at the vast , deserted airfield , a venue for some of the most secret operations of the @entity162 , miss @entity111 is saying nothing			1
‘ i ca n’t speak out of respect for @entity110 ’s wishes , ’ she says about her partner who was sacked			0
do they feel betrayed by sir @entity1 ? she smiles but refuses to elaborate			1
the reason , according to local people , is a gagging clause in the severance agreement signed by both men			0
is that true ? ‘ all i will say is that money is power , ’ miss @entity111 adds			0
sir @entity1 certainly has plenty of that			1
never extravagant in public , he has built a financial empire running into hundreds of millions of pounds			0
it is believed that the musician initially bought the farm to minimise his exposure to tax such fortunes are rarely subject to detailed public analysis , but a light was shone on the singer ’s wealth in 2008 when he faced his second wife , @entity190 , across the floor of the @entity192 in @entity31 to hammer out a divorce settlement			2
miss @entity190 demanded £ 125 million from her former husband , claiming his fortune amounted to some £ 800 million			2
the judge calculated @entity1 ’s fortune at half that and awarded @entity190 £ 24 million			1
during the hearing , the extent of sir @entity1 ’s property empire became known , including the obligatory repertoire of superstar homes in @entity31 , @entity204 , the @entity205 and @entity206 , as well as his farm in @entity208 and house in @entity210			1
that @entity211 survives in sir @entity1 ’s portfolio is due mainly to sentiment			1
it is thought to have been bought initially to minimise the young @entity1 ’s exposure to tax			1
the year was 1966 , @entity217 was playing on the nation ’s radios and the lad from @entity221 was enjoying his first season as a millionaire			2
@entity1 ’s then girlfriend , the actress @entity224 , helped him select @entity7 from a pile of properties for sale , and visited it with him			2
but it was @entity19 , @entity24 , who took the place to her heart , renovating the three - bedroom farmhouse while @entity1 installed a recording studio			1
the song @entity234 was inspired by the area , as well as , of course , @entity15 , accompaniment for the latter being provided by @entity87 ’s pipe and drum band			2
‘ it was a love song really , ’ explained sir @entity1 , ‘ about how i enjoyed being there and imagining i was travelling away and wanting to get back			1
’ sir @entity1 and his advisers are said to be no longer willing to accept losses on his farms and are renting out fields to neighbours , while encouraging forestry converts to vegetarianism ( this week sir @entity1 appeared in a video in which he gave an impromptu rap , encouraging fans to give up meat one day a week ) , the @entity98 allowed the farm to grow wild			1
deer multiplied , fields became overgrown and the couple ’s four children , @entity260 , @entity261 , @entity262 and @entity263 , found themselves at home in an enormous playground , isolated from prying eyes			0
drive along the tracks linking sir @entity1 ’s holdings and you enter a dreamscape of rolling hills topped by conifers , a quiet , otherworldly place of loch and burn			1
‘ local people did n’t bother sir @entity1 — they let him be , ’ says mr @entity72			1
‘ the great attraction was that he could fly into the small airport in his private jet and within 20 minutes be in a different world			0
’ @entity19 ’s death in 1998 was a turning point			1
gradually , visits to @entity7 tailed off			2
perhaps there was too much pain in its associations , but the singer has refused to part with a property replete with family memories			0
there are still visits to @entity7 by relatives and friends of sir @entity1 , but visits by the singer - songwriter are now virtually unknown			1
it is thought that he has not dropped in on his @entity0 home for around five years , one of the last great influxes of @entity98 being in 2003 for the wedding of @entity262 , a clothes designer , on the nearby isle of @entity302			0
‘ the gates to the estate are padlocked now , ’ says mr @entity72			0
‘ i would n’t say it ’s hostile but a relationship that was once close is now strained			0
i have nothing against the new manager ; it ’s the policy that ’s changed			0
’ once , the principled @entity98 would not allow fodder from their farm to be sold to feed animals destined for slaughter			0
@entity7 was a hippie paradise in which profit counted for little			0
but that appears to have changed , too			0
sir @entity1 and his advisers are said to be no longer willing to accept losses on his farms and are renting out fields to neighbours , while encouraging forestry			1
‘ basically , the place became a wildlife haven , ’ says mr @entity72			0
‘ it was quite a sight to see the hundreds of deer roaming over the land — beautiful			0
it was very beautiful the way it was			0
i am very sad at the changes made			0
‘ but despite those changes , i personally have very great respect for sir @entity1			1
he has done an enormous amount for the area and injected an enormous amount of money into the local economy			0
‘ there were never any airs and graces			0
he and his family are truly pleasant people			0
’ others are less effusive			0
one woman , who refuses to give her name , says : ‘ we do n’t care about these celebrities if they are not living here or contributing to life here			0
’ down in @entity87 is a memorial garden dedicated to @entity24			2
her image sits there , in bronze , cradling a lamb			0
sir @entity1 did not attend its unveiling			1
in @entity15 , @entity1 sings of wanting ‘ always to be here ’			1
but 37 years after the song seduced the nation , it seems his ardour has cooled .			0

sir @entity1 bought @entity25 , @entity8 , in 1966
it was was the first house he shared with former wife , @entity24
his visits to @entity15 became fewer after @entity19 died in 1998
staff were told their services would no longer be required last year
sir @entity1 and advisers are no longer willing to accept losses on his farms
@entity15 was the first single to sell two million copies in @entity40
