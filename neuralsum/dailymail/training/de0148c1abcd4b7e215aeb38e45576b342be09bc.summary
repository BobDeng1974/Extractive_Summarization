as one @entity0 shuffled out of @entity1 fretting privately about what the future holds , another @entity0 bounded out with a renewed sense of purpose			1
if things have been increasingly bleak for @entity9 manager @entity8 , the season has hardly gone to plan for @entity11 striker @entity10 either			1
his starts have been rare , goals scarce and speculation increased that he might move on in this window			2
@entity16 and @entity17 are keen but he is not interested			1
@entity0 ’s dream came true when he moved to @entity19 from @entity20 last june and he wo n’t give up on it just because the transition has been bumpy			1
@entity0 ( right ) scored @entity11 's second goal in the 2 - 0 win over @entity9 on saturday @entity0 was visibly overjoyed at scoring his second @entity26 goal for @entity11 why should he ? the 32 - year - old substitute may have been on the pitch for only 20 minutes here but he made a difference , sweeping in the goal that guaranteed a win			1
such was his joy , he almost jumped into the @entity34 to celebrate with @entity11 ’s fans			1
‘ that ’s the best way to affect a game , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ in the past i maybe would have passed instead of taking it on myself			2
it was nice to secure the game after @entity42 had saved us			2
‘ i love those celebrations , i love watching them on tv			2
to do it myself with the @entity11 fans is something i ’ll always remember			1
the best moment i ’ve felt since i ’ve been here			2
‘ i ’ve no intention of leaving @entity11 while they want me			1
if they do n’t want me i ’ll go but i ’m here to help in whatever way i can			0
’ his manager believes he is doing that			0
@entity57 pumped the air with his fist as @entity0 ’s drive sneaked past @entity61			1
‘ i was delighted for him , ’ said @entity57			0
‘ he is making the contribution i wanted			0
there is a spotlight on him because of the unavailability of other players but he was brought in to make an effect			0
he ’ll always score goals			0
’ @entity11 manager @entity57 ( right ) was delighted with @entity0 's role in the victory there will be no dwelling on this win , not with @entity75 in town on tuesday for the first part of their @entity79 semi-final			1
few will give @entity11 hope of victory over two legs			1
‘ i went to the @entity85 semi-final against @entity75 in 2005 , ’ @entity0 said			2
‘ it was the best atmosphere i ’ve ever experienced			0
can we do the same ? it would be brilliant			0
we ’re getting better , we ’ve got players coming back and we ’re still in all the cups			0
‘ @entity75 will probably be favourites but we ’ve got the winning mentality back			0
i ca n’t talk all day about iconic games from the past			0
we want to have our own			0

@entity0 got his second @entity26 goal in @entity11 's win over @entity9
@entity16 and @entity17 are interested in *buying* him
but the striker wants to stay put and help @entity11 out in any way he can
