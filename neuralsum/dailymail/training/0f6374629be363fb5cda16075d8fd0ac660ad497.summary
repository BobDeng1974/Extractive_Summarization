by @entity0 published : 20:35 est , 23 january 2014 updated : 20:36 est , 23 january 2014 the prime minister will say that fracking will attract firms to move posts back to the @entity6 and make @entity6 the ¿ re-shore nation ¿ cheap energy from shale gas will help fuel a trend that is seeking thousands of @entity6 jobs shifted to low - cost countries in the @entity14 brought back home , @entity8 will declare today			1
the prime minister will say that fracking , coupled with cuts to business taxes and red tape , will attract firms to move posts back to the @entity6 and make @entity6 the ‘ re-shore nation ’			1
according to @entity25 figures , some 1,500 manufacturing jobs have already come back to the @entity6 since 2011 , while major companies are also reopening call centres previously shifted to countries such as @entity29 and the @entity30			1
experts say various factors are driving the trend , including companies wanting to improve quality , shorten lead time and improve delivery performance			1
as middle classes expand and wages rise in emerging economies such as @entity42 , there is also a narrowing advantage in terms of costs			0
speaking to the @entity47 in @entity49 ski resort @entity48 , the prime minister will acknowledge that companies are certain to continue moving production facilities to countries like @entity29 and @entity42 in the years to come , but he will insist that the @entity52 should not be ‘ written off ’			1
citing recent research which found that one in ten small and medium - sized businesses have brought production back to the @entity6 over the last year - twice as many as have sent it abroad - he will say that reshoring could become ‘ a fresh driver of growth in @entity62 ’ and @entity6 should take advantage of the trend			1
‘ for years the @entity52 has been written off , ’ mr @entity8 is expected to say			0
‘ people say that we are facing some sort of inevitable decline			0
they say we ca n’t make anything any more			0
‘ whether it ’s the shift from manufacturing to services or the transfer from manual jobs to machines , the end point is the same dystopian vision - the @entity14 wins while the @entity52 loses ; and the workers lose while the machines win			2
‘ i do n’t believe it has to be this way			0
‘ of course , we can not be starry eyed about globalisation - it presents huge challenges as our economies and societies try to adapt			0
but neither should we take this pessimistic view			0
the prime minister will suggest that governments can encourage the trend by acting to ensure supplies of cheap energy ‘ indeed if we make the right decisions , we may also see more of what has been a small but discernible trend where some jobs that were once offshored are coming back from @entity95			1
’ the prime minister will suggest that governments can encourage the trend by acting to ensure supplies of cheap energy			1
business secretary @entity98 said : ¿ @entity6 industry is coming home ' ‘ there is no doubt that when it comes to re-shoring in the @entity106 , one of the most important factors has been the development of shale gas which is flooring @entity106 energy prices with billions of dollars of energy cost savings predicted over the next decade , ’ he is expected to say			1
‘ taken together , i believe these trends have the ability to be a fresh driver of growth in @entity62 too			0
i want @entity6 to seize these opportunities			0
i think there is a chance for @entity6 to become the ‘ re-shore nation ’			1
’ before flying out to @entity48 , mr @entity8 visited ventilation and heating equipment manufacturers @entity120 , which has recently moved production from @entity42 to @entity122 , in @entity123			0
other companies which have brought jobs back to the @entity6 include food manufacturer @entity124 ’s , which is moving its factory from @entity42 to @entity127 , model train firm @entity128 , which is shifting some manufacturing from @entity29 to @entity6 , computer company @entity132 , which has moved production to @entity134 , and fashion brand @entity135 which is bringing as much as 10 % of its manufacturing back to @entity6 after a 15 - year absence , said @entity142			1
business secretary @entity98 said : ‘ @entity6 industry is coming home			2
' over the last few months i have welcomed many companies who have taken manufacturing , textiles , call centre work or software abroad , bringing jobs back to the @entity6			1
' this is a sign that diverse , high - quality @entity6 manufacturing is on the rise once again			2
‘ it also highlights the ability of @entity6 - based business to stand strong in the face of global competition			2
’ @entity162 ’s shadow business secretary @entity161 said : ‘ @entity8 and @entity163 have failed to deliver the stronger , balanced recovery we need to see			0
‘ the @entity167 - led government came to office promising an export - led recovery but the @entity6 ’s trade deficit is growing			2
any help for manufacturers is welcome after three damaging years of flatlining and in a month where factory orders have fallen back			0
' but after so many @entity25 schemes have failed to deliver for business , manufacturers will want to see what this one offers in practice			0
‘ @entity162 would create a proper @entity6 @entity181 supported by a network of regional banks , a skills system which delivers for businesses of all sizes and would cut business rates to help growing firms			2

the prime minister will say that fracking will attract firms to move posts back to the @entity6 and make @entity6 the ‘ re-shore nation ’
according to @entity25 figures , some 1,500 manufacturing jobs have already come back to the @entity6 since 2011
