hundreds of fighters from the @entity2 republic of @entity3 have formed their own ' @entity4 ' to join the insurgency in east @entity6			2
the 300 or so volunteers say they are mostly former state security troops in the mainly @entity9 region , where @entity10 has fought two bloody wars since the fall of the @entity13			1
@entity14 reported seeing dozens of the armed men in camouflage uniforms chanting ' @entity17 ' as they trained in the snow in their camp outside @entity20 , east @entity6			1
the @entity42 says regular @entity2 troops are involved in the fighting , while @entity2 accuses @entity45 and the @entity46 of engineering a coup in @entity48 and supporting its new @entity50 regime			2
' this is volunteer battalion @entity52 , ' said the deputy commander of the group , who only gave his nickname ' @entity57 '			1
he spoke to @entity14 at a former tourist camp outside the rebel stronghold of @entity20 , east @entity6 , which he and his men have turned into their base			1
' there are about three hundred of us in @entity20 region			0
we have battlefield experience from 10 to 20 years starting from 1995 , ' said the man , in his forties , a pistol fixed to his thigh			0
he had a little @entity3 flag in green , white and red stitched to his cap and spoke @entity2 with a strong @entity76 accent			0
several cars with @entity3 registration plates were parked in the camp			2
in training : seasoned @entity25 fighters , whose combat experience often dates back to the 1994 - 96 and 1999 - 2000 wars , fight on both sides in @entity6 , adding to the complexity of the conflict divided region : in @entity6 , @entity57 's men are sworn enemies with another group of @entity25 who fight on the opposite side of the conflict and support the @entity48 government troops ' this is volunteer battalion death ' : the deputy commander of the group , who only gave his nickname ' @entity57 ' , told @entity14 the unit was made up of around 300 @entity25 with 10 to 20 years battlefield experience @entity2 sides with east @entity6 's rebels but denies sending troops to reinforce them			1
some fighters on the ground admit to being former @entity2 servicemen , or ' on leave '			0
@entity10 says any @entity2 fighting there are volunteers			0
@entity3 's own separatist insurgency , in which the republic sought independence from the @entity2 , was eventually squashed after two bloody wars , but unrest still simmers among @entity112 groups			2
gunmen attacked a police post and captured a building in the regional capital of @entity117 last week and at least 20 people , including ten police and ten suspected militants , were killed in gunbattles that ensued			0
violence erupted hours before @entity2 president @entity123 had been due to give a major speech in @entity10 , a symbolic challenge to the man credited for the @entity2 's victory in the second @entity3 war			1
re-establishing @entity10 's control over @entity3 and then introducing an uneasy peace under @entity131 , whom critics and rights campaigners accuse of heavy - handed tactics and human rights violations , is seen by mr @entity123 's supporters as a key achievement			1
hand to hand combat : two @entity25 fighters practice their wrestling in the snow while their comrades watch physical training : the men jog along the snow - covered roads of the war - torn region phew ... but by this point they seem to have slowed slightly to rather less than a jog ... lots to work on : the formation appears to break up as the faster fighters speed off around the corner in @entity6 , @entity57 's men are sworn enemies with another group of @entity25 who fight on the opposite side of the conflict and support the @entity48 government troops			1
some of them have @entity42 passports after fleeing @entity2 following the two wars			0
they say @entity10 is theirs and @entity48 's joint enemy and that @entity3 is occupied by @entity2			1
@entity57 , however , said @entity3 was being destroyed in the wars of 1990s and became peaceful again only when some local leaders allied with the @entity170			0
some of those in the ' @entity52 ' unit said they had initially fought against @entity2 in @entity3 but later switched sides and were amnestied by a former @entity170 - allied head of the region , @entity131 's father , @entity175			0
' now we are ( former ) soldiers and officers of the @entity2 army , of @entity2 special forces , mostly veterans of war campaigns , ' @entity57 said .			0
