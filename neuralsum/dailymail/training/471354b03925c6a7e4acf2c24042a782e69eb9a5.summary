by @entity0 @entity2 senator @entity1 said on monday night that he is ' not sure ' if @entity3 care about poor people as much as @entity5 do			1
' if you really cared you 'd talk about the problems they have , ' @entity1 told a group of conservatives at the @entity12 meeting on monday evening			1
' if you really cared [ about poor people ' ] you 'd talk about the problems they have , ' former sen. @entity1 told a group of conservatives at the @entity12 meeting on monday evening the @entity17 is a monthly gathering organized by @entity19 , a @entity20 best - selling author and instructor at the @entity22 in @entity23			1
@entity1 was at the event to promote his new book , @entity26 , which was released that day			1
in the book @entity1 lays out problems facing ' working @entity29 , ' an issue he expounded on monday night			1
during the q and a portion of @entity1 's remarks , the 2012 presidential candidate was asked whether or not he supports the @entity35 , a wage supplement for low - income @entity29			1
the @entity37 says it refunded more than $ 63 million to 27 million people in 2013 under this provision			2
republicans often prefer an expansion of the @entity35 to a minimum wage increase because it takes the burden off of employers to pay their workers more and places it on the government to give poor people more of their hard - earned money back			1
it has been expanded by every president since @entity50 , and another expansion of the tax credit is included in @entity54 's recently released annual budget			2
' the earned income tax credit is a good idea			0
there are things we need to do to reward work , ' @entity1 said			2
' we need to talk about work			0
we need to talk about the importance of work			0
' he said he generally dislikes the way the government 's entitlement programs work because they create a disincentive to work , though			0
' wonder why people feel trapped in welfare ? it 's because you lose money the more money you make , ' he said			2
' let me tell you another thing that you lose			0
you lose the ability to marry			0
' @entity1 then proceeded to explain how the welfare program in @entity81 works , according to a state senator he met there when he was campaigning for president			1
in @entity81 , he said , a single mother who has two children and earns $ 15,000 a year qualifies for $ 38,000 a year in welfare benefits			0
if she gets married , she would lose it all , @entity1 said			2
' we trap people in dangerous relationships , ' @entity1 said , referring to the @entity29 government			1
' it 's not because single moms do n't have relationships - of course many of them do - many of them actually have cohabitating relationships , which are incredibly dangerous , not just for the mother but for the children , and government does that			0
' that 's when he launched into his attack an attack on the @entity3			2
' we [ @entity3 ] do n't talk about this because – well , people ask me , " do @entity3 care as much about the poor as @entity5 do ? " i 'm not sure we do			1
i 'm not sure we do			0
' ' and the reason i 'm not sure we do is because i do n't hear us talking about it very often			0
and if you really cared you 'd talk about the problems they have			0
' @entity114 chair and 2012 @entity3 vice presidential nominee @entity113 and @entity116 senator @entity116 of @entity117 have voiced their support of the @entity35 or similar programs within the last few months			1
@entity116 even made the creation of a new , similar program – one without restrictions on childless applicants – the focal point of a major poverty speech earlier this year .			0

former @entity2 senator @entity1 was in @entity12 on monday to promote his new book
at a meeting of conservatives , @entity1 was asked for his thoughts on the @entity35
the @entity35 is a wage supplement often preferred by @entity3 over a minimum wage hike
as part of his *response* to the question , @entity1 said he 's ' not sure ' if the @entity3 cares about poor people as much as @entity5 do
if they did , he said , they would be talking about issues that *affect* poor people more often
