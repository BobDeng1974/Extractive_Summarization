click here to read @entity2 's match report on heartbreak for @entity4 at the @entity5 there are certain , unavoidable signs of a centre forward lost in a haze of low confidence and @entity11 exhibited them in spades on wednesday night			1
heavy first touches , weak finishing , failure to get the head up and utilise peripheral vision			0
you could easily have put the @entity21 striker ’s name all the way down the checklist			0
it can be painful to watch , whoever you support			0
down the other end of the field , @entity4 ’s @entity26 must have looked on and winced			1
he knows what it feels like to see the goal shrink to the size of a waste paper bin but the @entity34 also knows what it ’s like to come out of the other side of a confidence crisis			2
@entity26 survived his own issues at @entity4 and surely @entity11 will survive his own here in @entity41			1
@entity11 looked low on confidence as @entity21 laboured to a goalless draw with @entity4 @entity11 was outshone by his @entity4 counterpart @entity26 ( r ) at the @entity5 with @entity26 – who arrived at @entity4 on the back on bundles of goals for @entity49 in january 2011 – it was the demands of life in a new league and environment that foxed him			1
that and a very modest relationship with his manager at that time , @entity57			0
with @entity21 ’s @entity60 striker @entity11 , it would appear to be the challenges of playing for a really big club that is vexing him after his move from @entity65			1
he has actually scored five goals this season already , the only problem is that four came in one game for @entity69 last week			1
@entity11 skewed his opening shot just wide after being smothered out by @entity71 in the first half the @entity69 international was unable to find any joy from his tussles with @entity76 prior to this game , every one of the talkers at a @entity21 press conference – coach @entity77 and players @entity80 and @entity82 – was asked about @entity11 ’s poor form by journalists			1
the replies were all positive , of course , but only goals really matter when it comes to hushing chatter about centre forwards in press rooms and bars and cafes			0
@entity11 has one for @entity21 in the @entity95 so far but it came away at @entity96			1
he has n’t scored at the @entity5 yet and , until he does , the chatter will go on			1
on wednesday he certainly had his chances an opening half that @entity21 dominated			0
had he been wearing the yellow of @entity65 rather than the famous red of @entity21 then he perhaps would have scored twice early in the game			1
the first opening looked made for him as he moved in to space on to a pass on the edge the penalty area but as @entity21 supporters shuffled towards the edge of their seats in anticipation a first touch so heavy as to be almost violent took the ball away from him			0
@entity11 battles with @entity4 defender @entity114 for the ball but could n't get his goal city defenders rush into challenges as @entity11 makes his way into the danger area soon after he did manage to guide the ball around @entity71 but , from a tight angle , the ball was subsequently directed rather meekly in to the side netting			1
that is what low confidence does			0
it turns things that normally come naturally in to challenges that , all of a sudden , ca n’t be met			0
certainly this was a different @entity21 team last night than the one that we are used to			0
take @entity134 and @entity135 out of this side and the whole pattern – the whole rhythm – of the play changes			0
with @entity21 ’s two scampering wide men flying down either side and – when the mood takes them – cutting inside , it must be a dream to be a number nine			0
however , the play was a little narrower and one can only imagine that when @entity134 and @entity135 do return from injury @entity11 ’s life will become rather easier			2
here against @entity21 ’s chances came in a flurry early on and @entity71 had to be somewhere near his best to keep his team in the game			2
@entity26 was chosen to start ahead of @entity153 and led @entity4 's line with a commanding performance @entity26 has overcome his early teethinbg problems at the @entity157 after winning @entity159 's trust as @entity4 gradually improved , so @entity26 was able to exert himself on the contest , though			1
such is his standing at @entity4 now that it was not such a surprise to see the 28 - year - old handed a starting berth ahead of @entity153			1
with @entity166 allowed to go back to @entity167 at his own request last month , @entity4 coach @entity159 will rotate his three remaining strikers all season long			2
@entity26 , at last , looks capable of more than holding his own			2
on wednesday his running was intelligent and his hold - up play astute			2
one run on to a @entity175 pass – that led to a shot to the near post – looked almost intuitive			0
when players do n’t think too much , good things just happen .			0

@entity4 lost 1 - 0 to @entity181 in @entity183 opener
former @entity4 defender @entity82 scored a late winner
@entity11 still struggling after move from @entity188

by contrast @entity26 has overcome his early problems at with @entity195
