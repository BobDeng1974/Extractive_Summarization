the one thing a referee must have is credibility – the confidence of the players to do his job			1
@entity6 clearly did not have that at @entity8			1
this was not a derby or a game with history			0
nor was it a game between two physical teams and that was probably why @entity6 was appointed			2
to be fair the players did n’t make the game easy for the match officials by pressurising them to caution and dismiss fellow professionals			2
however , there were only 23 free kicks awarded and they resulted in six yellow and a straight red card			0
not enough control from the referee and perhaps too much advantage			1
@entity28 shoves @entity29 , and is shown a straight red card by @entity6 in the aftermath @entity28 gets involved in a melee near the dugout as players from both @entity35 and @entity36 get involved @entity28 walks down the tunnel at @entity8 after being shown his marching orders for a petulant incident the incident which led to the dismissal of @entity28 was the one to grab the attention but that stramash was the result of earlier ill feelings			1
certainly @entity47 ’s sliding feet - up challenge was one which showed how the players did n’t trust @entity6 to take the action required			1
four of five of each team screamed at the hapless @entity6 and each other and hopefully the @entity54 will review the video and charge the clubs at their lack of control			1
then in the 65th minute the disrespect for each other and the referee erupted as players completely lost their discipline			2
there was pushing and shoving , barging and posturing by players from both teams			0
@entity28 started it by barging @entity68 who responded by barging him back			0
as others joined the melee @entity29 pushed his head into @entity28 ’s face and the @entity35 forward responded by slapping @entity29			0
@entity73 and @entity28 look incredulously at @entity6 after he brandishes a red card @entity47 was booked for a studs - up challenge on @entity76 - he knew he would not be sent off tempers fray as @entity6 gives @entity78 a yellow card for his challenge once the dust settled @entity6 , after advice from the fourth official , sent @entity28 off but took no further action			1
@entity29 was certainly fortunate not to be dismissed as well and not content with the part he played he then demanded the red card for @entity28			0
it was easy to see why @entity35 were so frustrated			0
the fact @entity36 ended up winning the game just rubbed salt into @entity35 ’s wounds .			0

a referee must have credibility , and @entity6 lacked that on *sunday*
he did not have control of the match , and played too much advantage
@entity47 *'s* feet - up challenge showed the players did *n't* trust referee
the @entity54 should charge both clubs for not controlling their players
