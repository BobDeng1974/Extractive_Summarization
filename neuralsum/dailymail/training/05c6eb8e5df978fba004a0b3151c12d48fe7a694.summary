by @entity0 published : 20:57 est , 29 january 2013 updated : 21:02 est , 29 january 2013 @entity4 dissidents are plotting a terrorist outrage in the run - up to the @entity7 in @entity8 this summer , @entity2 sources have warned			1
ministers are said to be alarmed by the resurgence in hardline republicanism in recent months , with hundreds of youngsters signing up to join the shadowy ' new ira ' , which has vowed to continue the armed struggle to create a united @entity8			2
two recent attacks also indicate that extremists have now obtained access to former @entity13 weapons , which were meant to have decommissioned as part of the peace process			2
at risk : the recent terrorist attacks linked to @entity13 means that violent action in the run - up to the meeting of @entity7 leaders , pictured in the @entity27 last year , can not be ruled out @entity29 plastic explosive supplied by @entity31 dictator @entity30 in the 1980s was used in a failed car bomb attack on an off - duty @entity8 policeman last month			1
and a rifle used in the murder of prison officer @entity36 in november has been linked to previous @entity13 attacks more than a decade ago			2
the planned arrival of world leaders for the @entity7 in june is posing a major headache for security forces dealing with the upsurge in republicanism and the recent outbreak of loyalist violence in the @entity47 flags protests			1
ministers are confident that the venue for the summit at the @entity52 resort , near @entity53 , is secure , and insist there is no consideration being given to changing the venue to the mainland			1
but they acknowledge there is a growing risk that republican extremists will attempt to mount a terrorist ' spectacular ' in the run - up to the event , when the eyes of the world are on @entity8			1
possible target : the @entity7 leaders will gather at @entity66 in @entity53 , @entity8 , this june for the summit planning ahead : two recent attacks also indicate that extremists have now obtained access to former @entity13 weapons , which were meant to have decommissioned as part of the peace process a @entity2 source said : ' the venue is secure - we are absolutely confident about that			1
but we can not rule out a cowardly attack beforehand			0
the republican threat is growing			1
' any attack would raise questions about the decision to stage the @entity7 in @entity8 , which was meant to show the world that life in the @entity85 had been transformed for good			1
dissident republican groups have never entirely gone away , but until recently they were comprised mainly of veteran hardliners who were never reconciled to the peace process			0
the so - called new @entity13 was formed last year from a loose alliance of hardline republican groups			2
unlike former groups it is enjoying success in attracting fresh support from the @entity85 's disaffected youth			0
sources claim the group has attracted up to 700 new members and is ' actively recruiting '			0
like previous groups it operates on fear , doling out punishment beatings and shootings on a weekly basis , as well as plotting attacks on the security services and other @entity2 targets			0
sources acknowledge that its leaders are beyond the control of @entity110			0
there are fears that the group also has ambitions to mount a new campaign on the mainland			0
recent events suggest it may have access to the equipment needed to conduct a campaign , but there are doubts about whether it yet has the logistical and organisational skills to sustain a series of attacks on the mainland .			0

security ' can not rule out ' an @entity13 attack on the @entity7 in @entity8
a source said although the venue is secure , the republican threat is growing
@entity7 leaders will gather at the @entity52 resort , near @entity53 , in june
