you 'd be forgiven for thinking this incredible picture is an artist 's impression of a planet forming around a star			1
but it is in fact the most detailed real image of a planet 's birth ever taken , revealing a phenomenon astronomers could only theorise about a few decades ago - and one that could help explain how the solar system formed			1
the planet - forming disc surrounds @entity16 , a sun - like star around 450 light - years from @entity18 in the constellation @entity20			1
@entity38 , located in @entity39 , uncovered never - before - seen features in this system , including multiple concentric rings separated by clearly defined gaps			1
' these features are almost certainly the result of young planet - like bodies that are being formed in the disk , ' said @entity38 deputy director @entity49			1
' this is surprising since @entity16 is no more than a million years old and such young stars are not expected to have large planetary bodies capable of producing the structures we see in this image			1
' an artist 's impression of a planet - forming disc			1
newly formed planets can be seen traveling around the central host star , sweeping their orbits clear of dust and gas			2
these same ring - link structures were observed recently by @entity38 around the young star @entity16 all stars are believed to form within clouds of gas and dust that collapse under gravity			1
over time , the surrounding dust particles stick together , growing into sand , pebbles , and larger - size rocks , which eventually settle into a thin protoplanetary disk where asteroids , comets , and planets form			1
once these planetary bodies have enough mass , they dramatically reshape the structure of their natal disk			0
@entity38 's highest receivers sit on a plateau some 16,500ft ( 5,000 metres ) above sea level			2
the secret to @entity38 's incredible resolution comes from two factors : height and distance			2
the observatory 's highest receivers sit on a plateau some 16,500ft ( 5,000 metres ) above sea level			0
this is far above most of @entity18 's atmosphere and water vapour , which obscures observations			0
astronomers working in @entity38 's facility at 9,500 feet ( 2,900 meters ) must use supplemental oxygen for extended stays			2
the system currently comprises about 50 functional antennas			0
when the array is finished , there will be 66 of these receivers that can be moved as far as 16km ( 9.9m ) apart			0
the antennae capture astronomical signals from the sky individually , then combine their results in a supercomputer to get precise information about where the signals come from			0
researchers say it is similar to how we use our two ears to locate sounds around us , but on a universe - size scale			0
this high - resolution not only lets @entity38 observe young planetary systems , but also pin down hydrogen and life - building blocks in gas clouds			2
the array can also track the evolution of galaxies			0
they fashion rings and gaps as the planets sweep their orbits clear of debris and shepherd dust and gas into tighter and more confined zones			2
the new @entity38 image reveals these striking features in exquisite detail , providing the clearest picture to date of planet formation			1
its new high - resolution capabilities were achieved by spacing the antennas up to 9.3 miles ( 15km ) apart			0
@entity16 's surroundings , as seen by @entity149			0
@entity16 is a sun - like star around 450 light - years from @entity18 images with this level of detail were previously only seen in computer models and artist concepts			1
' this new and unexpected result provides an incredible view of the process of planet formation , ' said @entity160 , director of the @entity161 ( @entity161 )			0
@entity16 is hidden in visible light behind a massive envelope of dust and gas			0
since @entity38 observes at much longer wavelengths , it is able to peer through the intervening dust to study the processes right at the core of this cloud			0
this is an artist 's impression of a young star surrounded by a protoplanetary disc in which planets are forming ' this is truly one of the most remarkable images ever seen at these wavelengths , ' said @entity161 astronomer @entity179			1
' the level of detail is so exquisite that it 's even more impressive than many optical images			0
' the fact that we can see planets being born will help us understand not only how planets form around other stars but also the origin of our own solar system			1

image is of planet - forming disc surrounding sun - like star , @entity16
it was taken by @entity38 in @entity39
it shows multiple concentric rings separated by clearly defined gaps
these are discs in which asteroids , comets , and planets are created
images such as this could help us understand origin of solar system
