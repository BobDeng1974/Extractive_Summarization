three women tortured a man by pressing burning hair tongs and a cigarette lighter on to his genitals when they found he had dated three people at once , a court has heard			1
the trio also taunted the victim with a pizza cutter in what was described as like a scene from @entity12			2
@entity13 , 47 , @entity14 , 19 , @entity15 , 22 , along with male defendant @entity16 , 27 , had plotted revenge on the victim for allegedly seeing several women at a time and lured him to a flat in @entity22 before strapping him to a chair			1
@entity14 , who appeared at @entity24 after admitting torturing a man in a scene like the film @entity12 the three women and one man then carried out a prolonged attack on the victim , who was also forced to drink liquid wash before having the hot curling tongs pressed to his genitals			1
@entity24 @entity35 heard one of his tormentors also burnt him with a cigarette lighter as the others laughed and giggled			1
during the torture he also had a pizza cutter pressed to his cheek and was punched , kicked and slapped repeatedly			2
the court heard @entity13 bit the man 's ear , pushed his head down to his knees and used a cigarette lighter to burn the back of his neck , before threatening to suffocate him as she put a scarf around his mouth			1
she then ordered @entity15 to burn his genitals with hair curling tongs before pulling the chair back , causing him to fall backwards onto the floor			2
@entity15 , who also took part in the attack , which saw the man have burning hot hair tongs pressed on his genitals the frightening escalation of the assault prompted @entity15 and @entity14 to alert @entity16 , who was reputedly the ringleader of the assault and took part in the beating , but had retired to a bedroom before @entity13 upped the ante in a scene reminiscent of the bloody @entity75 film			1
@entity16 untied the victim and picked him up off the floor , then went back to the bedroom and fell asleep , while @entity13 nodded off on a sofa			2
@entity15 then took the flat door keys out of his pocket and released the victim , whose @entity84 phone had been stolen and later pawned by @entity85			0
the four torture suspects were later arrested after the victim 's step - mother called police			0
@entity24 @entity35 heard each blamed one another for the sickening attack but @entity16 and @entity13 were found to be the main protagonists			1
the four suspects were originally charged with falsely imprisoning the man on november 10 , 2013 , but this was eventually dropped by the @entity96 and they each pleaded guilty to assault occasioning actual bodily harm			1
they appeared for sentence on friday , when the court heard that @entity16 - who has previous convictions for assault and battery - had been smoking cannabis on the day in question			0
after being bailed by police , he went on to commit a burglary and was also charged with handling stolen goods taken in a separate raid			0
@entity15 , who had once been in a relationship with the victim , and @entity14 , a mother - of - one on benefits , both had clean records up until the attack			2
barrister @entity116 , for @entity85 , said the defendants had lured the man to the flat to teach him a lesson for allegedly seeing several women at the same time , but he claimed that @entity13 had been the ' main player ' in the torture scene			1
@entity123 , for @entity124 , said her client had severe mental health issues and was under @entity85 's spell			0
@entity24 @entity35 , pictured , heard how as the victim 's burnt him with a cigarette lighter the others laughed and giggled			1
@entity15 's defence barrister @entity132 said she had acted ' wholly out of character ' under orders from others			0
' ' her role was to use the ( curling ) tongs but she insisted they were n't on full heat , ' he added			0
recorder @entity141 told the defendants : ' you all participated in an attack upon ( the victim ) which was designed to embarrass and humiliate him			0
' @entity13 , of @entity22 , was spared a jail sentence because she had spent five months on remand and was ' clearly a troubled woman with a history of psychological difficulties '			0
she was given a two - year community order with supervision , ordered to attend the women 's @entity155 in @entity22 for a 20 - day course , and made to pay a Â£ 60 victim surcharge			0
