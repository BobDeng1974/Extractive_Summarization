@entity1 will deploy a military force of 600 to the @entity3 as part of international efforts to combat @entity7 extremists , prime minister @entity0 has announced			1
mr @entity0 said @entity1 had received a specific request from the @entity10 government to contribute forces to possible military action in @entity13			1
he said the contingent of @entity16 troops had been sent to the @entity3 to act as military advisers , but he outlined the role they would play should @entity1 commit to combat			1
' we had a specific request from the @entity10 to be prepared to commit and we have been welcomed by the @entity13 government			1
' so this is one of the fundamental differences between this potential commitment and the commitment that was made 11 years ago			0
' @entity49 and the @entity50 met on sunday to discuss the matter			0
@entity1 's contribution will include up to eight @entity54 aircraft , an early warning and control aircraft , aerial refuelling aircraft and a contingent of @entity16 troops			1
' the government has decided to prepare and to deploy to the @entity60 a military force , ' @entity0 said in @entity62 on sunday the prime minister emphasised that @entity1 was part of an international coalition			1
he said the deployment did not mean @entity1 was at war			2
' there are obviously further decisions to be taken before @entity1 forces will be committed to combat operations in @entity13 , ' mr @entity0 said			2
' nevertheless , @entity1 is prepared to engage in international operations to disrupt and degrade @entity39 because of the threat that this murderous death cult poses not just to the people of @entity13 , not just to the people of the @entity3 , but to the whole world , including to @entity1			1
' special forces troops will act as military advisers to @entity13 and other security forces fighting @entity7 extremists			0
mr @entity0 warned @entity1 's involvement could last many months , rather than weeks			2
he said he was not aware of any @entity1 being held hostage by @entity85 terrorists			2
@entity0 has announced that 600 @entity1 troops will be sent to the @entity3 in an effort to diffuse @entity39 conflict the @entity90 group has released a video purportedly showing a masked militant killing @entity94 aid worker @entity93 , who was taken hostage in @entity96 in march 2013			1
mr @entity0 's reaction to the beheading - the third in recent weeks - was one of ' shock , horror , outrage and fury ' and he now had a steely determination to tackle the terrorists			0
' the evil and exaltation in evil that was yet again on display today , should make all of us more resolved than ever to do whatever we reasonably can to disrupt , degrade and if possible destroy this movement , ' he said			0
he would not call the movement @entity7 because it was neither @entity114 nor a state			0
' it is a death cult , ' mr @entity0 said			0
the prime minister said about 400 air personnel and about 200 military personnel would be involved in the deployment			0
he said ' air elements ' would depart in the next week or so , while " military elements " could depart sooner			0
600 @entity1 troops will be sent to the @entity60 to join an @entity10 led initiative ' we think this is a balanced and proportionate contribution to what is our fight , but it is the world 's fight , ' mr @entity0 said			1
' @entity1 has a long and proud tradition of doing what we can to help at home and abroad to make for a safer @entity1 and a safer world			2
' he rejected suggestions growing involvement in @entity13 would make @entity1 a target			2
' these terrorists and would - be terrorists are not targeting us for what we have done or for what we might do , they are targeting us for who we are , they are targeting us for our freedom , our tolerance , for our compassion , for our decency , ' he said			0
@entity148 , air chief marshal @entity149 , said disrupting and degrading @entity7 would take a ' comprehensive and sustained effort '			0
' but ... if we do nothing , the risk of allowing the shocking acts of @entity39 to further destabilise the @entity3 and spread beyond the @entity3 region , potentially back to @entity1 , is a greater risk , ' he said .			1
