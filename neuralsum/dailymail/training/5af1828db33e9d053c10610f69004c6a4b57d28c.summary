they have never been the most conventional of couples			0
but even for @entity2 , 47 , and her husband @entity3 , 24 , alarming your neighbours with an @entity8 assault rifle takes some beating			1
a passer - by spotted the weapon through a basement window of the £ 15million @entity14 home owned by the artist - turned - director and her actor husband – triggering a full - scale raid by armed police			1
the couple ’s agent revealed the @entity8 rifle was a ‘ certified and fully decommissioned ’ one given to mrs @entity2 by , of all unlikely things , an international peace charity			1
according to a @entity46 source , the couple now face being talked to by officers for wasting police time and resources			1
they will also be advised that leaving the rifle in full view of the street was ‘ irresponsible ’			2
neither mrs @entity2 , who is directing the film version of @entity55 , nor her husband , best known for wielding an array of lethal weapons in the gory @entity60 films , was at home when the incident happened			1
the alarm was triggered shortly before midnight when a man claiming to be an ex-iranian soldier spotted the @entity8 rifle on an office table in the basement window of their home in @entity14			1
a neighbour , @entity70 , 47 , was passing at the time and saw armed officers swoop on the house			1
he said : ‘ i was just walking my dog and saw an old man looking down into the couple ’s basement window			2
‘ i looked down and was shocked at what i saw – a gun lying on a desk			2
‘ the older gentleman said he was an ex-iranian soldier and said it was a machine gun			0
two minutes later we were bundled into the back of an unmarked police car			0
‘ then a whole load of armed police came			0
i ’ve never seen anything like it			0
they covered the area brandishing guns			0
nobody appeared to be in to let them into the property so they deliberately let the alarm off			0
artwork : the gun was given to mrs @entity2 after she contributed to a charity anti-arms exhibition a @entity46 spokesman said : ‘ local officers and officers from the @entity46 ’s @entity104 attended and were let into the property to examine the firearm			1
it was confirmed that the firearm was a deactivated @entity8 rifle			1
’ ‘ they then had to wake up a magistrate judge to get a warrant to enter the property			0
i believe they broke in round the back			0
when i returned the next morning , the gun was gone from the desk			2
’ he added : ‘ i think it ’s shocking that so much police time and money was wasted			0
as a resident in the same street here for almost 20 years i am appalled that anyone should think it ’s acceptable behaviour to possess guns of this type – much less leave them on public display			0
‘ the area is a family orientated one with low crime and a great sense of community			0
’ a police spokesman later said officers did not break into the property because they were let in by a friend with a key			2
yesterday the couple ’s spokesman said the gun had been given to mrs @entity2 by the charity @entity145 , which turns decommissioned rifles into works of art to promote non-violence , and was in her basement studio			1
mrs @entity2 , formerly known as @entity2 , began working with @entity145 in 2012 when she and a number of other artists agreed to transform an @entity154 assault rifle into a work of art. they are now working on a similar project involving @entity8 assault rifles .			1
