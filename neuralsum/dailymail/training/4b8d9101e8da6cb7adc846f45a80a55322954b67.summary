by @entity0 in @entity1 published : 18:51 est , 2 september 2013 updated : 09:23 est , 3 september 2013 @entity3 strongman @entity2 has challenged the @entity4 and @entity5 to prove that he used chemical weapons against his own people			1
he claimed on monday that while his armed forces might possess chemical weapons , @entity3 soldiers would never have used them in an area where they themselves might be killed			1
@entity5 newspaper @entity13 asked @entity2 to ' demonstrate ' that his army ' did not resort to using chemical weapons on august 21 in the suburbs of @entity17 in an attack that killed more than 1,000 people , ' according to a translation published by @entity21			1
proof : president @entity2 says the @entity4 and @entity5 need to show evidence that he used chemical weapons against his own people president @entity25 and @entity5 president @entity26 have accused him of presiding over the attack , which @entity4 sources said on monday included the use of sarin nerve gas			1
but those claims , @entity2 said , remain mere accusations			1
and ' someone who makes accusations needs proof '			2
' we challenged the @entity4 and @entity5 to show us proof , ' he said			2
' mr @entity25 and @entity26 were incapable even when asked to do so by their own peoples			0
' @entity25 is plotting more extensive action in @entity3 to crush @entity2 ’s military and topple the dictator , it emerged today			1
the @entity4 president has been thought to be planning limited and targeted strikes to deter use of chemical weapons , after the deadly attack in @entity17 which killed more than 1,400 people			1
but @entity50 briefings for senior senators suggest the @entity4 military intervention will be much wider and more devastating			0
general @entity53 , a former vice chief of staff of the @entity54 , said mr @entity25 wanted to ‘ degrade ’ @entity2 ’s military forces while at the same time ‘ upgrading ’ those of opposition forces to trigger regime change			1
speaking after talks with senators including @entity61 , who has been briefed by the president , general @entity53 said : ‘ the president has decided to deter the use of chemical weapons but also to degrade military capacity of the @entity2 regime			2
‘ at the same time he has upgraded the capacity of the opposing forces			0
‘ and it ’s the opposing forces that hopefully would be able eventually to topple the @entity2 regime , ’ he told @entity68 ’s today programme			2
@entity2 left open the question of ' whether or not the @entity3 army possess these types of arms '			1
but he suggested that since some of his soldiers were among the casualties , any claim that the attack originated with them was illogical			1
' suppose that our army wished to use weapons of mass destruction , ' he speculated			2
' is it possible that they would do so in an area where they are themselves , and where soldiers were wounded by these arms , as was stated by the @entity94 inspectors who visited them in the hospital where they were treated ? ' ' where is the logic ? ' the @entity2 regime has suggested since august 21 that rebel groups launched the chemical attacks , a position that has won little backing internationally			1
but there remains little global appetite for military intervention in what has become a protracted civil war with near - global implications			0
the @entity4 , @entity108 and @entity5 quickly lined up last week to recommend targeted military strikes , but @entity110 suffered an embarrassing defeat when @entity112 voted down his proposal			0
the @entity5 parliament will debate a similar measure on wednesday , but with the promise of new disclosures from the country 's intelligence services , which reportedly have tracked the @entity3 chemical weapons cache dating from before the @entity122 war			2
the @entity4 may be the last to act			0
president @entity25 said on saturday that he will ask @entity124 to approve any military action , even though he has the authority to order strikes without their permission			0
mr @entity25 also has the power to recall the full @entity124 from its summer break for an emergency session , but he has not done so			0
with a scheduled return date of september 9 , any vote will be at least a week away			0
the @entity134 published an informal ' whip count ' on monday afternoon , estimating current levels of support among @entity50 and @entity139 members based on legislators ' public statements to date			0
no logic : @entity3 dictator @entity2 tells a @entity5 newspaper his armed forces would not use chemical weapons in an area where they would also be affected death toll : hundreds died in the alleged chemical attacks , including many women and children ' evidence ' : secretary of state @entity152 said images like these contributed to the @entity4 assessment that chemical weapons were used in @entity3 that accounting shows 57 of 100 senators undecided , with 23 in favor of military action and 20 opposed			1
it would take an effort of 40 senators to block any resolution			0
in the @entity50 , however , only 16 representatives have said they will vote to authorize military action against @entity3 and 91 said either that they strongly oppose it or are leaning toward a ' no ' vote			2
another 88 have said they are undecided , and 240 have made no public statements			0
at least 217 ' yes ' votes will be required to pass a @entity50 resolution			0
investigation : @entity94 inspectors collect samples from @entity176 , near @entity17 report : inspectors examine potential evidence of the chemical weapons attack in @entity180 foreign affairs panels in the @entity139 and @entity50 will return to @entity1 on tuesday and wednesday to hear testimony from secretary of state @entity152 and secretary of defense @entity183 - a former @entity139 dove whose marching orders are now decidedly hawkish			2
rather than being part of an open debate , however , those presentations are seen as components of a @entity50 persuasion effort aimed at sparing mr @entity25 the defeat mr @entity110 experienced on thursday			0
as part of that effort , mr @entity152 and mr @entity183 , joined by national security adviser @entity194 and director of national intelligence @entity195 , spoke to about 125 @entity198 lawmakers during a conference call on monday , with mr @entity152 insisting that @entity2 is a ' two - bit dictator ' whose time has come and gone			2
crisis talks : president @entity25 and vice-president @entity201 meet with secretary of state @entity152 and national security advisor @entity194 to discuss @entity3 on sunday @entity2 , however , warned in the interview excerpts @entity13 published online that military attacks against @entity3 could result in a regional war that would spiral out of control			1
' @entity206 is a powder keg and the fire is approaching today , ' he said			1
' you ca n’t only talk about what the @entity3 response will be , but what could happen after a first strike			1
and no one knows what would happen			0
' ' everyone will lose control of the situation when the powder keg explodes			1
chaos and extremism will be widespread			0
the risk of a regional war exists			0

@entity2 says attack would have been illogical as his soldiers were also among the *victims*
@entity3 leader *blames* rebel groups for destruction that killed more than 1,000 people
warns strike from @entity235 would set of ' @entity206 powder keg '
