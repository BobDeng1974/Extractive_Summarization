by @entity0 published : 08:46 est , 31 december 2012 updated : 12:38 est , 31 december 2012 while many streets across the country are decorated with festive greetings , the roads of @entity2 look distinctly less cheerful			2
rubbish has piled up around the city after collections were suspended for @entity9 and @entity10 leaving residents angry			1
but homeowners are asking why the city 's council did not organise an extra collection , or rearrange the delivery date so it would not clash with @entity9 or @entity10			2
piles of rubbish litter the @entity20 area of @entity2 , and residents fear the winds will blow the rubbish all over their community household waste in the area has built up over the festive period , and homeowners have demanded to know why a collection could not have been made those living in @entity30 in @entity2 say the winds threaten to scatter the rubbish everywhere			2
furious resident @entity33 , 69 , who has lived in the area all her life , said : ' the rubbish is 10ft high in some places , the winds are getting pretty high and if the bags are n't collected soon the rubbish will be blown everywhere			0
' if that happens we are going to have rubbish in our houses and gardens , what would be done about that ? ' surely an extra collection could have been arranged for the day after @entity10 ? ' local @entity49 , 35 , an account manager , added : ' i do n't pay my council tax for my rubbish not to be collected just because it 's @entity9			0
' surely if a service is going to be removed then we should get some money back ? ' did they not think that @entity9 means far more rubbish ? far more for us to deal with ? rubbish dump : the council says they widely publicised the fact that collections would not be made over @entity9 residents have been ' shocked ' that the council did not provide a @entity9 rubbish collection ' i bet they blame government cuts or something , but they could have just rearranged it for the next day			1
' as for seeing adverts about it across the city , well i certainly did n't see any , it came as a complete shock to me and my family			0
' mother - of - two @entity75 , 29 , is frightened that the build up of waste will spread germs : ' the whole area is going to stink soon , it 's raining here and the bags are becoming saturated with the water			0
' soon this is going to start breeding diseases , we should not have to deal with that , especially not at this time of year			0
' resident @entity88 , 45 , said : ' we all have a bit more rubbish at @entity9 , and when they do n't come and pick it up what can we do ? ' it 's piled high down every street , you have to walked down the pavements everywhere , and sometimes it 's started to blow into the road			0
' they have n't even cleared the litter bins they provide on the streets , so those are overflowing as well			0
' pretty soon this whole area is going to start to smell awful			0
' @entity106 has warned councils they face a cut in @entity111 funding if they do not reinstate weekly collections a spokesperson for @entity114 said the collection dates had been ' widely publicised '			1
he said : ' the bins are collected weekly , they were suspended over @entity9 and @entity10 and that was widely publicised			1
' collections resumed on the 27th and will be continuing over @entity119 , if they would normally have a collection on @entity10 they will have on on january 2			1
' @entity114 could face the wrath of communities secretary @entity106 , who warned councils last month that they face a cut in government funding if they refuse to reinstate weekly bin collections			1
local government and communities secretary @entity106 says a voluntary scheme has ‘ stopped the rot ’ and prevented more councils switching to hugely unpopular fortnightly schemes.but he threatened to go further - suggesting central government grants to local authorities will be slashed in the long - term for those that refuse to bring back the weekly bin @entity138 least half the homes in @entity140 - 10million households covered by 180 local authorities - have lost their weekly collections and now have general rubbish taken away only once every two weeks			1
the politician said in his vow to bring back weekly collections : ' i believe it ’s a fundamental right for every @entity149 and woman to be able to put the remnants of their chicken tikka masala in their bin without having to wait two weeks for it to be collected			1
' once - a - week household rubbish collections came into law in 1875 to stamp out cholera and other plagues which claimed huge numbers of lives			1
they were maintained until after @entity164 ’s 1997 election victory , when local authorities were encouraged to collect household waste and recyclable rubbish on alternate weeks			0
the @entity168 downgraded councils in their inspections if they kept weekly collections and told them to adopt ' progressive ' solutions of ' only emptying the refuse bin on a fortnightly basis or issuing smaller bins '			1
the @entity175 announced a £ 250million scheme to prevent more local authorities moving to fortnightly collections and persuade others to switch back			2
mr @entity106 has approved bids from 85 councils			0
but despite his strong words , just five local authorities have restored weekly collections in full .			2

@entity114 says it ' widely publicised ' fact that collections were suspended
