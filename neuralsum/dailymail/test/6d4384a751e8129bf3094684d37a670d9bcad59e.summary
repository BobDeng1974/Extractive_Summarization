pet aquarium fish are being dumped in rivers where they damage unique local ecosystems by growing up to twenty times their regular size			1
goldfish are being caught weighing up to 2kg and koi carp up to 8kg and one metre in length , in the waterways of @entity9 amongst other exotic introduced species			1
' a lot of these fish are much larger than the native fish , so they prey on them and compete for habitat , ' dr @entity11 , the director of the @entity12 at @entity13 , told @entity20			1
' in the south - west of @entity9 90 per cent of the fish and 100 per cent of the crayfish are only found there , so the rivers are refuges for the native fish and when they are forced to coexist with introduced species , they just do n't do very well			1
' aside from feasting on local fish and taking their homes , introduced species are also bringing exotic parasites and disease with them			2
' in @entity50 we 're aware of a couple of parasites			0
one is pretty devastating on native fish , it 's an anchor worm which is a little crustacean that leaves a hideous , hideous impact on native fish and was probably introduced by goldfish			2
a huge @entity59 was removed from a @entity50 wetland in novemeber last year : ' a lot of these fish are much larger than the native fish , so they prey on them and compete for habitat , ' dr @entity11 , the director of the @entity12 at @entity13 , said pest carps : ' in the south - west of @entity9 90 per cent of the fish and 100 per cent of the crayfish are only found there , ' he added ' we 've now found it in three rivers around @entity50 and south of @entity50			1
' it 's been only in the last decade that we 've discovered a lot of parasites and disease that we do n't know a lot about - there 's a lot of things that have come in to @entity9 that we really do n't know anything about			0
' research conducted by @entity82 and @entity83 found that at least 13 species of fish had been introduced into south - western @entity9 , with pet owners believed to be the biggest culprits			1
in 2012 , the world 's biggest ever specimen of a @entity91 cichlid was found living in @entity9			0
' goldfish in captivity generally remain orange , grow to about 10 - 15 cm and weigh less than 100g â€“ in the wild in @entity9 they get to @entity97 and 40cm , ' dr @entity11 said pet owners who have dumped their aquarium fish in rivers are the culprits behind the invasion in 2012 , the world 's biggest ever specimen of a @entity91 cichlid ( pictured ) was found living in @entity9 ' effectively people are unknowingly doing it - or occasionally they deliberately do it for fish to catch - but they 're basically released by pet owners , so people are n't really aware what damage they 're going to have in the ecosystem , ' dr @entity11 said			1
' what you see up and down @entity9 's coast is a lot of pest fishes are right in town centres and almost every town has one			0
' the problem is not unique to @entity9			0
many countries with @entity122 climates have also had their waterways invaded by aquarium fish which , due to being extremely easy to breed , take off when in the wild			0
' education is our best solution , once fish get in the waterways they 're extremely difficult to eradicate , ' dr @entity11 , whose organisation euthanizes hundreds of the pests after catching them through electric fishing , said			0
introduced species also bring exotic parasites and disease with them the problem is not unique to @entity9			2

aquarium fish are being dumped in @entity9 rivers by pet owners
@entity5 are growing from the regular 100g to 2kg and koi carp to 8kg
the exotic species compete with 10cm long native fish for food and habitat
they also introduce devastating parasites and diseases onto local species
