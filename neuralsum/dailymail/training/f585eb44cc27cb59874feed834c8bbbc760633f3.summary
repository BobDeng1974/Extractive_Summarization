by @entity0 @entity2 's footballers were pictured looking downbeat during their first training session after being kicked out of the @entity4 yesterday			1
the team were practising ahead of their last match of the tournament against @entity8 on tuesday afternoon			1
@entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 all wore worried frowns as they headed out for their penultimate practice session @entity13 for video the boss looks downcast : @entity17 after @entity2 's worst @entity4 performance since 1958 has something on his mind @entity20 is pictured looking glum on the @entity2 team bus as he heads to training ahead of the team 's last match against @entity8 on tuesday captain @entity11 also looked downbeat leaving the team 's hotel this morning , after @entity8 's win against @entity28 yesterday saw @entity2 out of the tournament @entity30 got the better of @entity2 's defenders on thursday - including @entity32 ( pictured ) - to score two and leave the team 's hopes in tatters unhappy goalie @entity36 faces questions at the press conference @entity10 had taken to @entity39 to apologise of the dismal performances , admitting , ' it has n't worked out '			1
the @entity42 forward told his 21 million @entity39 fans : ‘ going into each game we had great belief in ourselves but unfortunately it has n't worked out			0
sorry to all the fans that travelled and at home that we have n't done better			0
’ @entity10 was backed by his @entity51 teammate and @entity53 captain @entity52 who said : ‘ i do n't think you can blame him for scoring one goal , working his socks off and missing three chances by inches			0
‘ he gave his all for his country , like he always does			0
he 's a great player , a great goal scorer , so i do n't think it 's fair on him to criticise him that much			0
’ striker @entity9 said that he felt ‘ sick ’ and ‘ heartbroken ’ , while captain @entity11 added : ‘ we maybe should have accepted that going for a point [ against @entity65 ] might have been the best option			0
’ the lack of morale does not bode well for tuesday 's game against surprise group leaders @entity8 as @entity2 try to salvage a point from their disastrous @entity73 campaign			1
@entity8 will be looking to beat @entity2 on tuesday to ensure they finish the group top , with @entity2 have only pride to play for ( pictured , @entity77 , left , and @entity36 , right ) @entity10 carrying a toilet bag bearing his children 's picture wore a worried frown before training today , despite scoring his first @entity4 goal two days ago the only happy man was manager @entity17 , perhaps after hearing he will be keeping his job until 2016 @entity85 receives some advice from manager @entity17 during the team 's penultimate training session in @entity89 the only man smiling on the training ground was @entity17 , after @entity93 chairman @entity92 said that @entity17 would keep his job as @entity2 manager until at least 2016 , when the team are due to play their next major tournament			1
@entity2 have been drawn against @entity98 , @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 and @entity102 for the @entity104 qualifiers which begin in september			2
@entity92 said @entity17 remained the right man for the task , telling @entity107 : ‘ he came to do a four - year cycle			0
‘ people have been asking the question : " will he stay ? " well , the answer is yes			0
’ @entity8 , who are ranked 28th in the world , were written off before the tournament but have so far shocked fans and foes alike to beat both @entity28 , ranked ninth , and @entity65 , ranked seventh			1
their 1 - 0 victory over the @entity120 yesterday sent @entity2 crashing out of this year 's tournament before the end of the group stage , a low not experienced since 1958			2
and now the @entity124 will be looking for at least a draw on tuesday to guarantee that they will leave the @entity127 in first place , meaning they will play the runners - up in @entity130 in the last 16			2
@entity2 , meanwhile , having nothing except pride to play for as they sit bottom of the group without a single point having lost both of their opening games 2 - 1			2
@entity28 struck first in the opening game in @entity141 a fortnight ago , with @entity142 finding the target on 35 minutes			0
@entity144 ( pictured ) will be hoping for some more game time during the match against @entity8 after starting neither of @entity2 's two previous games @entity2 fans will now have to wait two years for the @entity149 before seeing their team play competitive games again - assuming , of course , that they qualify ( pictured : goalkeeper @entity36 , left , and winger @entity20 , right ) @entity154 winger @entity153 picked up an injury during one of @entity2 's warm - up matches , and has so far been unfit to play in @entity73 @entity10 combined with @entity9 two minutes later to produce a goal that saw @entity2 back into the game , but a @entity163 goal shortly after the start of the second half saw @entity2 capitulate			1
@entity10 may have scored his first @entity4 goal on thursday against @entity65 , but two strikes and two goals from @entity30 either side of that meant @entity2 's campaign was all but over			1
perhaps the only consolation is that @entity175 , reigning world and @entity174 champions , fared just as badly as @entity2 , crashing out after being thrashed 5 - 1 by the @entity176 and 2 - 0 by @entity177			0
@entity2 's 2 - 1 defeat to @entity65 on saturday marks the first time that the team have lost their opening two fixtures of the @entity4 since 1958 shock group leaders @entity8 beat @entity28 1 - 0 yesterday , ensuring @entity2 will head home early			1
