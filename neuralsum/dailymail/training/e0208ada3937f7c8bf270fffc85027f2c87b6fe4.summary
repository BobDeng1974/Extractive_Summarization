by @entity0 published : 05:31 est , 18 october 2012 updated : 06:21 est , 18 october 2012 @entity2 ’s stormy weather was n’t bad news for these daredevil surfers who risked their lives to ride a 24ft wave nicknamed ' @entity7 '			1
the wall of water - called @entity9 - is known as the @entity2 ’s biggest wave and was whipped up by 60mph winds			1
it is created when low pressure systems in the @entity15 trigger huge swells which rise up as they pass over a rocky shelf called the @entity18 off @entity19 , @entity20			1
the 24ft wall of water smashed onto @entity19 ’s @entity31 on wednesday around 1pm amid @entity2 ’s stormy weather - but it has been known to reach up to 30ft			1
the @entity26 is actually a short series of waves which have earned the nicknames ‘ @entity7 ’ and ‘ the @entity36 ’ because of the extreme danger of riding them			1
the @entity26 phenomenon happens just a handful of times every winter between september and april despite the danger local surfers @entity40 and @entity42 surfed the wave when it crashed in this week some surfers use ' waist high ' , ' head high ' , ' shoulder high ' and ' over head ' as an indicator of wave height			1
others measure the wave face from peak to trough - from the bottom to the top of the breaking wall of water , but it is often difficult to work this out exactly			2
the other way to measure waves is ' from the back ' - known as @entity63 - which translates to around half of the wave face height			2
for example a 3ft wave would be considered 6ft wave on this scale			2
the term ' from the back ' relates to when the wave starts to break			2
it draws water from the shore so that wave trough in the front drops below the average sea level , making the face bigger than the back			2

the amazing photos were taken by local photographer @entity82			0
he said : ' the @entity26 started coming in with low tide about 1.10pm and lasted a couple of hours until mid tide			1
' the surfers are taken out on jet - skis so it takes a while to catch each wave			0
there was a crowd of people watching them			1
' it is thrilling to watch			0
these guys are riding the biggest waves @entity2 has to offer			1
' the @entity26 is considered to be the @entity2 ’s biggest wave spot and is well renowned for its volatility , ferocity and power and is only to be taken on by professionals			1
the wave became the stuff of legend back in 1966 when three visiting @entity107 surfers stumbled upon the waves			0
ever since experienced surfers from across the globe have come to take on the challenge			0

@entity129 , area manager , said ' we are receiving regular weather updates from the @entity119 , continuously monitoring both tidal conditions and river levels and have had officers out overnight checking flood defences and closing flood gates			2
' people should be aware that there could be a lot of water in coastal areas , so avoid trying to drive or walk through any flood water and be sensible when out and about , particularly around the coast			1
' now is a good time for anyone who lives in an area vulnerable to flooding to think about the precautions they can take to protect their properties			0

the girl was unharmed but had a stiff talking to by locals after paying no notice to the warning signs			0

more coastal flooding hit @entity184 and @entity185 after a huge spring tide of nearly 20ft surged over the sea defences and left roads and car parks submerged			2
@entity190 started to pour into the @entity191 , in @entity192 , @entity185 , shortly before 1pm and rose up to six inches in some parts of the pub. @entity196 crash into @entity198 harbour , @entity199 which was partially flooded due to unusually high tides flood experts photograph the flooding in @entity198 , @entity199 after gales whipped up the waves @entity205 from the @entity124 puts sandbags round a drain in @entity198 harbour , @entity199 a giant wave crashes over a sea wall in @entity210 leaving debris all over the road the car park of @entity214 was under two feet of water , and @entity216 in @entity184 has been flooded with some cars parked in nearly a foot of water			1
in land , torrential rain overnight caused havoc on the roads in the south leaving many virtually impassable			0
