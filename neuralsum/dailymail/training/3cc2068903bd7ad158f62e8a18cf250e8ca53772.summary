by @entity0 published : 10:40 est , 8 may 2013 updated : 11:44 est , 8 may 2013 a controversial online tournament where boys pit their female classmates against each other and vote who is the best looking is facing calls to close amid accusations of bullying and sexism			2
may @entity10 is the name of the @entity13 page where the girls of @entity16 's @entity15 are judged and encouraged to ' look their finest ' throughout the month of voting			1
the anonymous creators and operators of may @entity10 post 64 yearbook - style photographs for the one - on - one voting and a girls name and picture can be entered into the contest without her permission			1
scroll down for @entity27 bullying : the controversial @entity13 page of may @entity10 allows students of @entity15 to vote who the hottest girl student is for 2013 designed to resemble the brackets of basketball 's @entity10 , each girl eliminates their designated opponent until they reach the final rounds where the winner of the competition which has been running for five years is decided			1
last year the dubious tournament was shut down when parents complained to the police about offensive comments placed under pictures of the girls , which is a crime in @entity47			1
however , this year the organizers have made it more difficult to post profane comments and are also exercising their 1st amendment rights by keeping the website running			2
district spokeswoman @entity53 said the contest ' does n't feel good ' to anyone			0
@entity15 tried to shut down the @entity57 website last year - but this year the student operators have banned offensive comments and brushed up on their 1st amendment rights ' these are pretty smart folks behind this , ' @entity53 said			1
' they know their first amendment rights			0
they 're very quiet about who it is and the group behind it			0
' school officials at @entity70 have said that this year they are monitoring the site for any signs it has stepped over the line - while it is doing all it can to discourage people from taking part			2
however , some fear that the damage has already been done			0
' almost every teenage girl has self - esteem issues , ' added student @entity82 to @entity83			0
' and doing something like that is absolutely ridiculous			0
' the school has admitted that unless legal boundaries are crossed there is little they can do to stop may @entity10 as the tournament is held off school grounds and if the girls keep their clothes on then no dress code rules are being broken			1
most students of @entity15 were critical of the website may @entity10 - believing it to be sexist and dangerous to the self - esteem of girls at the school the website can not be shut down because the voting does not take place on school property and the girls are not in any states of undress ' this kind of thing is sexualizing us girls like we 're some sort of trophy , ' said sophomore @entity110 to @entity83			1
last year , the may madness page had a direct link to the brackets and voting , but this year that is not readily accesible to the public			2
@entity53 said in an interview with the @entity118 that the concept ' preys on a lot of insecurities that already exist in adolescents '			0
so far , police have n't received any criminal complaints about may @entity10 , but are n't anticipating any either			1
some stood up for the organizers of may @entity10 though			2
