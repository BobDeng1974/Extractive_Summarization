by @entity1 reporter published : 19:26 est , 1 september 2013 updated : 19:27 est , 1 september 2013 high doses of statins may prevent dementia in old age , according to research			1
patients who received the most potent forms of the cholesterol - lowering drug were up to three times less likely to suffer from the disease , scientists discovered			2
the findings seem to back up earlier studies that claimed a widely prescribed statin may combat @entity16 ’s by improving the function of blood vessels			0
patients who received the most potent forms of the cholesterol - lowering drug were up to three times less likely to suffer from the disease , scientists discovered the latest research examined nearly 58,000 patients in @entity26 to discover if use of the drug was associated with new diagnoses of dementia			1
dr @entity31 , who presented the findings at the @entity33 in @entity34 said risks were reduced with increased total or daily dosages of the drug			2
‘ patients who received the highest total equivalent doses of statins had a three-fold decrease in the risk of developing dementia , ’ it was found			1
‘ similar results were found with the daily equivalent statin dosage			2
’ researchers found that the dosage rather than solubility of potent drugs such as atorvastatin and rosuvastatin were responsible for their effectiveness			0
almost every available version of the drug , except lovastatin , decreased the risk for new onset dementia when taken at higher daily doses			1
‘ higher doses of high potency statins gave the strongest protective effects against dementia , ’ said dr @entity31			1
high doses of statins may prevent dementia in old age , according to research ‘ a high mean daily dosage of lovastatin was positively associated with the development of dementia , possibly because lovastatin is a lipophilic statin while the anti-inflammatory cholesterol lowering effect of lovastatin is not comparable to that of atorvastatin and simvastatin			1
’ an earlier study found that a widely prescribed statin may prevent some of the symptoms of @entity16 ’s by improving blood vessel function			0
the research , carried out on mice by researchers at @entity87 in @entity88 , also found the drug boosted learning and memory in younger sufferers when the disease had not progressed @entity93 , treatment using simvastatin had no effect on one of the hallmarks of @entity16 ’s – a build - up of a particular protein in the brain , even in those who otherwise benefited			2
about 1million prescriptions for the cholesterol - lowering drugs are written in @entity103 each week , and statins have become a mainstay for doctors treating the survivors of heart attacks and strokes			0
they make up the vast majority of lipid - lowering drugs and are effective at lowering levels of cholesterol , the fatty substance in blood that clogs up arteries and leads to heart attacks			0
so far there has been no clear evidence that statins help reduce the symptoms of @entity16 ’s			0
in fact , memory loss is a known side - effects of the drug .			0

the latest research examined nearly 58,000 patients in @entity26
patients who received the highest total equivalent doses of statins had a three-fold decrease in the risk of developing dementia
