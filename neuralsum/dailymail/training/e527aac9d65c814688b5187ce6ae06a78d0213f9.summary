speaking from her home in @entity38 , mrs @entity10 , 66 , said : ' it was like getting a message from heaven – as if we were making contact with our grandparents and uncles and aunts and cousins that we have never known , because they were all murdered at @entity4			2
' it was like a miracle			0
we are overjoyed that the things were found , it 's beyond description really			0
' @entity14 added : ' on the other hand , we are pained and sad about the immense suffering of our family that it brings back			0
' mr @entity61 found the items next to suitcases from the period , which he believes had been looted			2
he carefully leafed through the documents and photographs – among them wedding pictures and family portraits – but was not able to identify the people in the pictures			2
mr @entity61 gave the items to the city 's @entity94 with the hope the family could be identified and relatives located			1
following research , it was believed the items belonged to the family of @entity26 rabbi @entity13			1
mr @entity13 , born in 1878 , was deported to the concentration camp in 1942 along with his entire family			1
it is thought the items were hidden before their deportation			0
poignant : these family photos were taken before the deportation of the city 's @entity26 began discovered : the photographs found in the @entity22 home are now known to belong to mr @entity13 's family discovered : this document , believed to feature college graduates , includes a photograph of a man with the surname @entity13 mrs @entity10 is the granddaughter of @entity13 and daughter of his only surviving child , @entity121			1
since the haunting discovery featured in an @entity7 article on december 31 , mrs @entity10 has been tracked down and she and her family have been overwhelmed with kind messages from people who had read the story			1
' we have received emails from all over the world , from as far away as @entity131 and @entity132 and from all over @entity6 , ' mrs @entity10 said			2
' they have asked if we are connected to the discovery that appeared			0
people have been very kind , and we want to thank @entity7 for caring about this miraculous discovery			1
' it means a lot to us , and it would have made my father very happy to know that the world has been told that there once was a good man named @entity13 who lived with his family in @entity22 and was killed during the war			1
' @entity13 , his wife , four children and two grandchildren all died at @entity4 before the end of the @entity150 , as did the entire extended family			1
only one @entity13 family member was still alive when the @entity153 liberated @entity4 in the spring of 1945 - @entity34 , the father of mrs @entity10 and her younger brother , @entity14 ( the @entity155 was dropped from the surname by the family in @entity6 )			1
@entity34 was serving as a rabbi in the @entity160 city of @entity161 when he was captured and deported in late 1941			0
family portrait : these smartly dressed subjects are thought to be connected to the @entity13 family treasured : now the memory of the well - respected family can live on in the hands of their descendants discovery : this was another of the documents found between the roof beams unassuming : the stash was found in the attic of this house , built next to the @entity179 synagogue @entity9 , an ally of @entity181 , played a very active and unflattering role in the @entity2			1
anti-semitic sentiments ran every bit as deep in the small @entity186 state as in neigbouring @entity181 , and the ruling national - conservative and @entity189 - based @entity187 , which took over shortly before the outbreak of @entity150 , eventually went as far as paying @entity181 to help empty the country of its @entity26 population – the ' alien element ' and ' permanent @entity194 ' , s interior minister @entity195 described the ethnic minority in a speech			0
in 1941 , @entity9 's government introduced the @entity26 codex , a large catalog of paragraphs which effectively stripped the @entity26 community of all civil rights and means of providing for itself			2
this was , however , only a first step on the way to achieving the end - goal			0
in february 1942 prime minister @entity210 declared that @entity9 would deport 10,000 to 20,000 young , strong men from @entity9 's @entity26 population to @entity181 as part of a deal to provide workers to the @entity181 regime			1
before the first transport even took place , however , @entity9 's government had convinced @entity181 to help make the country entirely free of @entity26			2
according to the new deal , @entity181 would take all @entity160 @entity26 and guarantee that no - one ever returned , while @entity9 agreed to pay @entity181 500 @entity221 for every person deported			1
the @entity223 , among others , officially protested the plan , but the @entity9 government remained hard			2
' we shall not stop this action under any circumstance , ' the interior minister made clear			0
' there is no foreign intervention which would stop us on the road to the liberation of @entity9 from @entity26 , ' @entity195 declared in a radio address on april 1 , 1942 , four days after the first deportation train containing 999 @entity26 women had left the @entity9 city of @entity239 with @entity4 as destination			1
before the war , some 136,000 @entity26 lived in @entity9			2
today , merely 4,000 people of @entity26 descent are registered as living here			0
historical sources estimate that as much as 80,000 @entity9 @entity26 were deported to concentration camps during ther war			1
in @entity22 , the third - largest city in @entity9 , the numbers are staggering : some 6,000 @entity26 were deported from @entity22 to concentration camps between 1942 and 1945			1
only 800 people returned to the city after the war , many of which later emigrated , among them the father of mrs. @entity10 and mr. @entity14			0
his parents assumed him dead and marked it with a one - week mourning period - yet he would be the only one of a large family to be alive after the war			0
he continued to perform secret religious services for his fellow prisoners in @entity262 and later @entity4			2
his wife died in the death camp @entity265			0
@entity34 also dedicated the remainder of his life to religion and community work			0
' our father made a promise to @entity273 while he was in @entity4 that he would spend his life as a communal rabbi in small @entity26 communities where he was most needed , ' said mr @entity14			1
' that was one of the things that kept him going – and he also kept his promise			0
' @entity34 remarried after the war and served as rabbi to fellow @entity2 survivors in @entity283 , before emigrating to @entity6			2
he arrived in @entity284 in 1949 with his pregnant wife and a baby - mrs @entity10			0
@entity34 mourned the loss of his three brothers , his sister and parents all his life , his children say			0
he marked the birthdays of his siblings every year , but otherwise he and his wife , who also lost her entire family , never spoke much of the horrors they experienced			1
' they were positive people who also taught us to have a positive approach to life , ' mrs @entity10 said			0
for that we are grateful and admire them			0
' newspapers : clippings from @entity307 papers were among the items hidden in the home manuscript : @entity13 's music			1
now his great - grandchildren can perform it @entity34 died of cancer in @entity38 in 1978 , at the age of 71			0
his life story has been well documented , and the @entity26 museum in @entity283 is planning to run an exhibition about him			0
the photographs and personal belongings found in @entity22 will form part of the display			1
mrs @entity10 and her brother are waiting to receive the package from the @entity94 in @entity22 , where the discovered items have been stored			2
they are most excited about a book full of sheet music composed by rabbi @entity13 , who also led the choir in the local synagogue and composed religious music			0
' my oldest son is a wonderful singer and also leads a choir in a synagogue here in @entity38 , ' mrs @entity10 added			0
' it will be a very special experience to hear him perform the music of his great - grandfather			0
' @entity9 had been an ally of @entity181 and the country supplied it with workers			0
however , when it fell short of the promised numbers , it agreed to replace the shortfall with 10,000 to 20,000 deported @entity9 jews			2
before the war , some 136,000 @entity26 lived in @entity9 , but now there are only about 4,000			0
in @entity22 , the third - largest city in @entity9 , some 6,000 @entity26 were deported to concentration camps between 1942 and 1945			1
only 800 people returned to the city after the war and many of them later emigrated , often to the @entity356 , @entity6 , @entity357 and the @entity358 .			2
