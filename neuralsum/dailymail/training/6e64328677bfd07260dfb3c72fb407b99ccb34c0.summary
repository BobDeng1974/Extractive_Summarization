' the council admitted its policy following a complaint from local shopkeeper @entity45 , who runs @entity46 in @entity6			0
mr @entity45 said he and at least five other shopkeepers had contacted the council to report a car with @entity51 number plates which had illegally parked in the town centre			0

i was outraged - my customer was there for a few minutes and the @entity51 car had been parked illegally for weeks and weeks			0
' it ’s discrimination against @entity69 drivers and i think it ’s absolutely unbelievable			2

the spokesman said that , by law , foreign vehicles must be registered with the @entity29 after being in the country for six months			1
