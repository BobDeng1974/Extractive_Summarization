@entity0 is thought to have been played for more than 2,000 years			1
but a strategy for winning the game of chance has evaded mathematicians until now			0
a team of researchers in @entity7 has found that most players use a strategy that appears random , but consists of predictable patterns that an opponent could exploit to win the game			2
game on : mathematicians have found that most players use a strategy for @entity0 that appears random , but consists of predictable patterns ( pictured ) that an opponent could exploit to win the game			2
this diagram explains that people often rotate from rock to paper to scissors when they are on a losing streak the first known mention of the game is in a @entity7 book called @entity28 , written by @entity29 in around 1600			1
he wrote that the game , which was called shoushilling , dates back to the time of the @entity34 from 206bc to 220ad			0
it is thought the game originated in @entity7 before becoming popular in @entity37			2
in the earliest version , a frog which is represented by the thumb , battles a slug ( little finger ) and a snake ( index finger ) although different animals have been used			0
the game arrived in @entity47 in the early 20th century and became popular in the 1920s in the @entity49 , before catching on in the @entity50 in the 1930s			0
the modern version uses rock , paper and scissors , although in some parts of @entity58 , cloth replaces paper			2
it was popularly thought that the best strategy for winning the game was to choose from the three ‘ weapons ’ at random , which over a large number of games means that a player is equally likely to win , lose or draw			2
this mixed strategy , which is also known as the @entity69 means that each choice has an equal probability in the next round of the game and previous experiments have shown that this works for @entity0 , @entity67 reported			0
however , convinced that there is more to the seemingly random game than meets the eye , @entity75 of @entity76 in @entity7 conducted his own experiment and discovered that gameplay typically consists of predictable patterns			1
if these are spotted and unlocked by players , they could go on to win the game			0
a total of 360 students divided into groups of six players , played 300 rounds of the game and recorded the outcome of each round			0
a first : mathematicians identified a feature of game theory called ' conditional response ' and it has never been detected before in @entity0 ( pictured )			1
the pattern could be used by canny players to boost their chances of winning players typically choose either rock , paper or scissors a third of the time - which if picked randomly , confirm the @entity69 concept			1
gamers on a winning streak usually stick with a particular action , while those that lost a round switch options in a ‘ clockwise ’ direction , from rock , to paper , to scissors			1
mathematicians studying game theory call this behaviour a ‘ conditional response ’ and it has never been detected before in @entity0			1
the findings are not surprising when you consider that it is human nature to stick with a winning strategy and make changes after losses			0
dr @entity75 found that typically , players in every one of the groups chose each option a third of the time – which if picked randomly confirms to the @entity69 concept			0
however , he also discovered that players on a winning streak tended to stick with a particular action , while those that lost switch options in a ‘ clockwise ’ direction , from rock , to paper , to scissors			1
mathematicians studying game theory call this behaviour a ‘ conditional response ’ and it has never been detected before in @entity0			1
dr @entity75 thinks this might be because the behaviour only becomes apparent in large - scale experiments			0
‘ this game exhibits collective cyclic motions which can not be understood by the @entity69 concept but are successfully explained by the empirical data - inspired conditional response mechanism , ’ he said			1
it might seem less surprising when you consider that it is human nature to stick with a winning strategy and make changes after losses			0
dr @entity75 plans on examining the psychological nature of the game in more detail and is interested in whether humans are hardwired to follow a conditional response strategy .			2

hundreds of games of @entity0 were played at @entity76 in @entity7 to *uncover* a pattern , which could be exploited
players on a winning streak tended to stick with a particular action , while those that lost switched from from rock , to paper , to scissors
this ' conditional response ’ has never been detected before in @entity0
