by @entity0 @entity1 : 20:53 est , 30 december 2013 updated : 10:28 est , 1 january 2014 photo : in this picture of a man 's face , it is possible to identify other people reflections from the eyes of child sex abuse victims in digital photographs could be used by police to catch paedophiles			1
according to new research from two @entity20 universities , the images of people reflected in the victim 's eye can be identified with the help of advanced camera technology			1
the eye 's pupil acts like a mirror in which the images of people standing behind the photographer are caught			1
the breakthrough means that unseen bystanders who witnessed a crime could now be identified once the high - resolution photographs are magnified			1
psychologists at the @entity35 and the @entity36 were able to extract such images and zoom in on them so that the subjects could be identified by third parties			0
lead researcher dr @entity40 said : ‘ the pupil of the eye is like a black mirror			2
eyes in the photographs could reveal where you were and who you were with			0
' dr @entity40 said it was possible to ‘ mine face photographs for hidden information ' including witnesses , bystanders and locations			0
in the study , dr @entity40 and the @entity36 's @entity56 photographed eight individuals , who were looking at four people behind the camera			2
the reflected faces were then cropped and magnified and subjects were asked to either match the images to mug shots or to identify the faces that they knew			0
close - up : it is possible to see a group of people reflected in the eye , using a technology which could lead to breakthroughs over crimes which are photographed by their perpetrators identifiable : the faces of individuals in the photograph can be seen by zooming in on the image the study , published in the journal @entity82 , found test subjects were able to spot the reflections of familiar faces 84 per cent of the time			1
when the reflected images were of unfamiliar people , observers were able to match the person to a mug shot with 71 per cent accuracy			1
the researchers said they were surprised to discover that even unfamiliar faces are distinguishable despite the poor quality of the images			0
the quality of images of reflected faces is about 30,000 times lower than a face that was directly captured in the same photograph			0
the researchers suggested this technique could become a crucial part in investigating criminal cases where in which victims are photographed , including hostage - taking and child abuse			2
but for the technique to work the photos has to be shot in high - resolution and the subject must be looking directly at the camera			1
the subject 's face must be in focus and well lit to for their eyes to give a clear reflection			0
researchers said that if images were available from both eyes , a @entity123 image could be constructed showing what the subject saw when the photo was taken .			0

research from @entity20 universities found technology can help id *offenders*
@entity136 's pupil acts like a mirror in which the images of people are caught
for the technique to work the photos has to be shot in high - resolution
