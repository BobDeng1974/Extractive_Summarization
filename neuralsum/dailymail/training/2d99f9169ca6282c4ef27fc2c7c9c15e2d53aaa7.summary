by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 called for @entity3 to be given more protection on tuesday night after the @entity6 youngster was injured in an incident with @entity9 midfielder @entity8			1
@entity8 will be waiting anxiously to see if the @entity10 take any action after he appeared to deliberately stand on @entity3 's outstretched leg towards the end of the game			1
if referee @entity15 confirms on wednesday that he did not spot it , then the @entity10 will be free to act and @entity8 's place in the @entity18 final against @entity19 a week on saturday could be in jeopardy			1
@entity9 boss @entity36 insisted that he did not see last night 's incident , but @entity2 described it as ' a joke '			1
he added : ' i did n't see it but i 've seen his leg			0
it 's the second time it has happened to him this season			2
it 's not great to see , and it 's terrible his leg			2
he 's a brilliant , exciting player and the authorities need to sort it out			2
it 's just the length of his leg , not cutting into his skin			2
it goes form his knee to his ankle			0
' @entity2 came on as a substitute for his 963rd - and possibly final - appearance at @entity58 in his last home game as interim boss , and admitted that he is still in two minds whether to play on next season			1
thin line : @entity8 was already on a yellow card for an earlier foul on @entity66 he used the occasion to give supporters ' a glimpse into the future ' , giving senior debuts to @entity72 and @entity66 alongside @entity3			1
@entity72 , 18 , scored two of @entity6 's goals and admitted that he only knew he would be in the team on the morning of the match			1
' it came as a shock but he had faith in me , ' he said			0
' i got out there and tried to show what i could do			0
my family were out in full force tonight and it was a great feeling			0
' when the first went in it was total euphoria			0
the second one was a great experience			0
it was about getting used to the physicality and the pace of the game			0
i played here for the under - 21s but it is different with 75,000 people			0
' tough tackling : @entity8 ( right ) makes a fair challenge on @entity3 during @entity6 's 3 - 1 win previous : @entity32 's @entity31 stamps on the ankle of @entity3 during a @entity104 match in 2013			1
