by @entity1 reporter @entity2 : 21:13 est , 25 december 2013 @entity3 : 21:13 est , 25 december 2013 leader : a picture believed to be @entity6 , who heads @entity8 's @entity7 scrawled notes from the shadowy leader of a powerful @entity11 fighting in @entity12 revealed a plot to kidnap @entity15 workers , according to excerpts of the letters			1
the plans , believed to have been written by @entity6 , were handed over by @entity20 intelligence officers along with the first known photo of the @entity7 leader			1
included in the notes from @entity6 , who heads one of the most powerful bands of radicals fighting the @entity12 government , were instructions for aides to continue with the plans in the event of his death			1
the officials said they obtained the information about @entity6 after capturing members of another @entity11 in september			0
they spoke on condition of anonymity because they were n't authorized to speak to journalists			0
' i was told by a soldier that he observed some of the workers of the @entity15 and he will kidnap them			0
i ask @entity44 for his success , ' read an excerpt of a letter given by officials from @entity20 's @entity49 , an anti-terrorism unit that works under prime minister @entity51			1
the officials said other letters planned the kidnapping and killing of other foreigners , and @entity12 and @entity20 civilians			1
one @entity15 worker was kidnapped for eight months in @entity12 and was released in october			0
another two dozen @entity15 peacekeepers were briefly held this year			0
it 's not clear if those abductions had any relation to @entity6 's letters			1
@entity12 's uprising began with peaceful protests , but it turned into an armed uprising after president @entity67 's forces cracked down on demonstrators			2
since then , hard - line @entity70 brigades have emerged as the strongest rebel forces in @entity12 , chiefly among them the @entity7			1
risks : a @entity12 who fled fighting stands by a sign for the @entity15 high commissioner for refugees in @entity77 under @entity6 's leadership , it has dominated rebel - held parts of southern @entity12 , and it is a powerful fighting force in the @entity83 countryside and northern @entity12 , with an estimated force of 6,000 to 7,000 fighters			2
@entity51 's shiite - majority government in @entity20 is considered a quiet ally of @entity67			1
the officials may have released the letter excerpts to underscore the dominance of @entity8 in @entity12			0
the intelligence officials did not where they found the @entity8 fighters who handed over the documents			0
they also would not say when the letters were written , though they said it represented a tiny sample of a large cache of documents			2
the officials could n't explain why the letter excerpts were in a sloppily written , grammatically incorrect version of an @entity104 dialect used across the @entity105			0
it is believed that @entity6 was an @entity104 teacher before he rose through @entity8 's ranks , and typically hard - line @entity108 try to write in classical @entity104			0
it may have been that an aide was writing down @entity6 's speech			0
arabs typically speak in dialects that are often quite different from the classical @entity104			0
' the claim by @entity20 intelligence that @entity119 and by extension , @entity7 , have been behind an explicit policy of kidnapping @entity15 workers should be treated with some suspicion , ' @entity115 , a prominent analyst of @entity12 's militant groups , said , referring to the @entity7 by its arabic name			1
' while it might well be true , elements within @entity20 's security services have a clear interest in portraying jihadists in @entity12 and @entity20 in a highly negative light			1
' @entity131 is known about @entity6 , including his real name			0
he is believed to be 39 , and the newly released photograph suggests a man in his thirties			0
@entity136 is a @entity137 , indicating he was born in the @entity139 - occupied @entity138			1
the @entity12 native joined the insurgency after moving to @entity20			2
he advanced through @entity8 's ranks and eventually became a close associate of @entity144 , the @entity145 - born leader of the militant group @entity8 in @entity20			1
he eventually returned to @entity12 shortly after the uprising against @entity67 began in march 2011 , where he formed the @entity7 , first announced in january 2012			2
the group gained prominence in april after @entity6 rejected an attempted takeover of the @entity7 by another rival @entity8 group , now known as the @entity153			2
@entity20 intelligence officials said it was members of that group who gave them the information about @entity6 .			2

@entity20 spies release letters and first known photo of head of @entity7
@entity136 's notes instruct others to continue with plans even if he dies
