@entity0 was benched by @entity1 for @entity4 's @entity3 draw at @entity5 on monday night			1
the reason ? ' jet lag ' , according to the @entity8			2
the striker had travelled all of 6,760 miles during the international break to play in @entity13 's friendly victories against @entity14 and @entity15 in @entity16 , so was deemed not fit enough to play at the @entity17			1
fair enough , you might say			0
but consider @entity20 for a second			0
@entity23 's star striker travelled a whopping 12,214 miles to play for @entity24 against @entity25 in @entity26 and then watch his country 's win in @entity29			1
that 's nearly double the distance @entity0 travelled - yet @entity20 played against @entity32 last saturday			1
he managed to scrape four goals too			0
taking in to account the last @entity3 matches before the international break and the first round of fixtures following it , @entity20 has played 241 minutes for club and country			2
@entity0 has managed just 220			0
so was @entity0 really too tired to start for @entity4 on monday ? @entity59 told @entity60 : ' i think @entity62 was ( back ) two days before @entity0 came back and he was in @entity64			1
it 's a big difference with jet lag and that 's the reason he 's out the team			1
' @entity20 travelled 12,214 miles to play for @entity24			2
@entity0 completed 6,000 fewer miles @entity20 struck four goals in a masterclass against @entity32 on saturday as @entity23 won 4 - 1 @entity20 taking a tumble during @entity24 's friendly defeat by @entity25 in @entity74 on october 11 @entity20 has played more minutes in the last two weeks and travelled further than @entity0 , but it was the @entity76 who was benched for ' jet lag '			1
@entity0 5/10/14 - @entity4 2 - 1 @entity79 , played 73 mins + 3,380 - mile flight to @entity16 11/10/14 - @entity13 3 - 0 @entity14 , 62 mins 15/1014 - @entity15 0 - 1 @entity13 , 67 mins + 3,380 - mile flight to @entity82 20/10/14 - @entity5 2 - 2 @entity4 , 18 mins total miles : 6,760 total mins : 220 @entity83 4/10/14 - @entity84 0 - 2 @entity23 , played 90 mins + 5,025 - mile flight to @entity74 11/10/14 - @entity25 2 - 0 @entity24 , 61 mins + 1,217 - mile flight to @entity29 14/10/14 - @entity29 0 - 7 @entity24 , unused substitute + 5,972 - mile flight to @entity82 18/10/14 - city 4 - 1 @entity32 , 90 mins total miles : 12,214 total mins : 241 but @entity20 's stunning form would suggest that , if that is the case , then @entity4 's loan signing from @entity91 might not be as fit as his @entity64 counterpart or perhaps not as able to recover from long - haul travel			1
consider , too , @entity95 midfielder @entity94			0
the @entity97 captain did not enjoy ideal preparation for the @entity100 ' trip to @entity101 on saturday			0
' @entity103 , he did n't come to the hotel until yesterday , he came straight from @entity105 to the hotel , ' @entity95 boss @entity102 said after the match			0
yet @entity108 scored at the @entity109 and @entity95 managed to grab a highly creditable 2 - 2 draw			0
' you just have to go on a long - haul holiday yourself , ' said @entity102 when describing the effects of jet - lag on players and the mental and physical demands of travelling to play international football			2
' you come back on a plane and you 're physically knackered yourself			0
' you ca n't sleep , you ca n't do this , so to expect to come and play a game of football ... ' @entity108 had ordered about 20 tickets for today , so i thought to myself " he wants to play "			0
he wants his mates and his family to see him			0
' @entity102 's comments could suggest that @entity0 was less enthusiatic about playing against @entity5 than @entity108 was about facing @entity101			2
but even if this is not the case and @entity0 simply was too tired to start for @entity4 , it must be concerning for @entity59 to think he could be forced not to play his new signing after every @entity13 match			1
@entity0 was all smiles during the warm up at the @entity17 despite being named as a substitute @entity13 striker @entity0 had not fully recovered after being away on international duty in @entity64 @entity4 's on - loan striker sits on the bench against @entity5 at @entity141 on monday night			1

@entity0 named among the substitutes @entity4 's clash at @entity5 on monday
@entity1 *blamed* ' jet lag ' for @entity0 not starting the match
@entity13 striker has been away on international duty in @entity64
@entity20 had also been away on duty for @entity24 in @entity26
but @entity23 striker scored four goals against @entity32
