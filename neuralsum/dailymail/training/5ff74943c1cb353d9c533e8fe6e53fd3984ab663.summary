by @entity0 published : 08:10 est , 7 june 2012 updated : 04:09 est , 8 june 2012 he had only gone on the internet to buy a birthday card for his mother			1
but 12 - year - old @entity5 ended up costing his father £ 7,000 after being lured into the world of online poker			1
the schoolboy , already a poker expert from playing the game on free smartphone ‘ apps ’ with his friends , could not resist the temptation to play for real stakes			2
addiction : @entity18 with his son @entity19 who spent £ 7,000 on gambling websites armed with his father @entity21 ’s credit card details , he quickly lost hundreds of pounds			1
and his efforts to recoup the money before he was caught only saw his losses snowball			2
now the family have joined forces with a child protection charity to raise awareness of how young people can fall victim to online gambling			2
figures last year suggested that as many as 60,000 children are problem gamblers			0
experts say young people are encouraged by free online games to enjoy gambling , only to find themselves sucked into the real thing			2
@entity19 , of @entity39 , @entity40 , had borrowed his father ’s credit card to buy his mother a birthday card from the @entity45 website			1
once online , he succumbed to temptation and went on an unconnected poker site , simply saying that he was over 18 to start gambling			0
he said yesterday : ‘ it started off in school			0
my mate got into the poker games , it was free to download , we were all doing it			0
‘ it was all virtual money but i got really good at it , i was making loads			1
i went on to one of the poker websites and put all the information in			0
‘ i started making a bit , but not as much as i was losing			0
’ desperate to win back the money he had lost on his father ’s card , @entity19 carried on playing , digging himself even deeper into a hole			1
addictive : @entity19 is now volunteering for a charity so he can warn other families about the dangers of underage gambling he was too ashamed to admit what he had done even when his father , a 52 - year - old lorry driver , found out to his shock that his credit limit had been exceeded and his card was blocked			1
mr @entity5 said yesterday : ‘ i was screaming and shouting at the credit card company , i did n’t know what had happened			1
’ @entity19 , now 13 , kept quiet for a week , wiping all the online games off the home computer in an effort to cover his tracks before he finally confessed			0
‘ i was mad , really livid , for weeks , but i was also shocked , ’ said mr @entity5			2
‘ it was so easy for him to do it			0
’ as no fraud had taken place , mr @entity5 had to pay the bill himself , which totalled £ 7,000 including interest			1
now he is working with child protection charity @entity88 to produce information packs for school and raise awareness of the pitfalls of online gambling			0
charity director @entity95 said : ‘ parents need to be aware of what their children are doing online , and these sites also have a responsibility to carry out proper checks that gamblers are over 18			0
’ controversially , mr @entity5 is organising a charity poker tournament in @entity104 to raise money to support @entity88			1
according to the charity @entity106 , 2 per cent of youngsters aged 12 to 16 have a gambling problem , more than twice the rate among adults .			0

@entity5 was playing on gambling websites using virtual money
but when he saw how much he was making he *decided* to gamble for real
he used a credit card his parents had given him to pay for his mother *'s* birthday card
