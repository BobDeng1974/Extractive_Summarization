the sobbing that cooks have endured while chopping onions in the kitchen could soon be a thing of the past			0
scientists say they have managed produce a tear - free version of the vegetable thanks to cutting - edge technology			2
@entity11 scientists disabled the production of the powerful substance that an onion releases as the knife slices into it , cutting down on the pungent fumes that bring tears to the eyes			2
no more tears : scientists say they have managed to disable the production of a powerful substance an onion releases as the knife slices into it , cutting down on the pungent fumes that bring tears to the eyes in a press release , scientists said that the typical burning sensation of a raw onion was reduced too			2
the enzyme responsible is known as lachrymatory factor ( lf ) synthase			2
when an onion bulb is cut it causes a chemical reaction that generates propanthial s - oxide			1
this makes up the @entity36 enzyme and is responsible for causing tears			1
this reaction also creates thiosulphinate , which creates the onion ’s distinctive flavour			0
when an onion bulb is cut it causes a chemical reaction that generates propanthial s - oxide ( pictured left )			1
this makes up the lachrymatory factor ( lf ) enzyme responsible for causing tears			1
@entity48 bombarded a bulb with irradiating ions to remove components and drastically reduce the level of @entity36 ( right ) the enzyme responsible is known as lachrymatory factor ( lf ) synthase			1

during tests , scientists found that lf is formed in the presence of an enzyme called alliinase ( @entity67 ) , typically found in garlic , as well as @entity69			0
if any one of these three components in the reaction was omitted , levels of @entity36 dropped			0
@entity48 , who developed the technology , bombarded a bulb with irradiating ions in a process that removed these components and drastically reduced the level of this @entity36 enzyme			1
during tests , scientists found that @entity36 is formed in the presence of an enzyme called alliinase ( @entity67 ) , typically found in garlic , and a compound called @entity69			2
if any one of these three components in the reaction was omitted , the levels of @entity36 drop significantly			0

the company 's researchers led by @entity95 won the @entity96 - an award handed out to honour achievements organisers consider unintentionally funny - in 2013 for their discovery of the biochemical process behind how onions make people cry			0
their research paper was published in the journal nature in 2002			0
however , a spokesman said no decision had yet been made on whether they would commercialise their tear - free onions			1
earlier this year , @entity111 supermarket @entity109 began selling its sweet red onion which has ' lower pungency levels '			0
this results in a milder flavour and fewer tears			0
this particular onion was grown by farmer @entity118 of @entity119 and costs £ 1 .			0

when an onion is cut a chemical reaction generates propanthial s - oxide
this makes up the @entity36 enzyme and is responsible for causing tears
scientists used irradiating ions to reduced the level of this enzyme
but a spokesman said no decision had yet been made on whether they would commercialise their tear - free onions
