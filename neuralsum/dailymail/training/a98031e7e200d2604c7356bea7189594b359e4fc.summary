by @entity0 published : 12:54 est , 2 october 2012 updated : 13:24 est , 2 october 2012 battle : for years @entity2 struggled with a phobia of vomit , so much so she would starve and drug her own children a woman ’s extreme fear of vomit led to her starving her young children in case food would make them sick			1
@entity2 would even give her three sons car sickness drugs before long journeys to ensure that they would not throw up			1
the 54 - year - old ’s emetophobia controlled her life during her sons ’ childhoods as she was too scared to feed them more than a basic diet of rice , toast and the occasional boiled egg			1
@entity2 ’s battle with emetophobia - the irrational fear of vomit - began when she was eight and her pregnant aunt was sick on her during a car journey			1
‘ it was a hot sticky day and i was horrified , ’ @entity2 explains			1
‘ it was of course an accident but the smell repulsed me and after that i began to actively avoid people who i thought might vomit			1
’ at school she avoided pupils who had been off sick as well as the canteen , which she considered a high risk area , and feared pregnant women			1
she would cross the street if saw a woman she suspected was pregnant and as she got older and her friends became pregnant she would simply cut them out of her life			0
‘ i lost friends because it would be too stressful otherwise , ’ she says			0
when @entity2 herself fell pregnant at the age of 20 , she lied to midwives to obtain medication to prevent her from being sick			1
‘ i said i had terrible morning sickness , thankfully i had n’t but i wanted to take something to prevent me getting it			1
’ despite warnings of side effects she took the medication throughout her pregnancy and gave birth to first son @entity56			0
she was a happy mother to a healthy baby boy , but it did not take long before the phobia took control of her parenting			1
‘ at first it was ok , the baby sick did n’t really smell of anything and there was n’t much			2
the real anxiety came when it was time to wean him because i knew that once he was on solid food he would produce what i called “ proper vomit			2
” ’ controlled : @entity2 , pictured with her oldest sons @entity56 and @entity74 , was so terrified of vomit that she would not give her sons any food she thought might make them sick and they grew up on a diet of toast , rice and eggs after pressure from her partner a reluctant @entity2 agreed he should be on solids			1
‘ i only gave him food i was happy would n’t make him sick and tiny amounts too			2
’ it was the same routine when his brothers @entity74 and @entity90 were born			0
by then her first marriage had ended and @entity2 had remarried , again managing to keep her phobia a secret			1
dinner for her sons was often toast and occasionally a boiled egg			2
‘ it would break my heart when they asked for dessert as i considered sweet foods to pose the highest risk and so i always lied and said we did n’t have any			0
‘ if they wanted snacks i gave them crackers and other meals were limited to plain rice and chicken , easy to digest and always well cooked			0
’ enough to survive : @entity2 justified her children 's low calorie intake of a few hundred a day with the argument that they had more than children in other parts of the world shockingly , @entity2 also kept their portions tiny , fearing that overfeeding them could induce sickness			1
‘ they were probably on just a few hundred calories a day			1
at most meal times they would ask for more like @entity124			0
‘ it broke my heart when they said their tummies hurt			0
i knew it was because they were hungry but i was so scared of not being able to cope if they were sick i never relented			2
‘ i knew they had enough to survive on and reasoned that they still ate more than a lot of children in the world			2
’ thankfully her sons grew into healthy boys and in the mid-eighties @entity2 attempted to seek help			1
but when she saw her gp she was ushered out of the door and in her desperation @entity2 turned to alcohol to cope			1
‘ i was left to cope in the only way i knew how			0
on the rare occasion that any of her kids were sick she downed @entity149 to give her the courage to clean it up			1
‘ i still could n’t cuddle them or hold them in the way a mum should if they were sick			2
and i would swig alcohol believing it might stop me from catching whatever bug they had by killing the germs			0
’ finally free : @entity2 , pictured on holiday in @entity162 with her husband @entity163 , eventually began to deal with her phobia when she came clean to her family about her behaviour holidays were also a nightmare , as she could not bear to watch them on funfair rides and feared travel sickness			1
‘ thankfully my parents were always keen to take them on holiday so i managed to avoid it most of the time			0
’ but when she did have to take the boys somewhere by car @entity2 resorted to shocking methods to prevent sickness			1
‘ i would drug them with travel sickness pills that caused drowsiness			2
if they were asleep then they could n’t vomit , ’ she says			2
when they grew older she would pay them to take the drugs , despite them not even feeling sick			1
‘ then they would close their eyes for the rest of the journey and i could relax and get us there without worrying			0
’ coping : @entity2 now lives in @entity196 and can enjoy meals in restaurants and time with her grandchildren without fear @entity2 calls her actions during these years ‘ truly awful and unspeakable behaviour for a mother ’ but says the phobia was in control of her life			1
‘ it ’s very hard to distinguish right from wrong , you are just trying to get through the day in any way you can			2
‘ i loved them dearly and i did n’t want them taken off me			0
’ she says : ‘ my phobia stopped me being a good mother			2
but i ’m adamant that i will not let it stop me being a good grandmother			0
' my sons are now old enough to understand why i acted the way i did when they were little			2
’ eventually @entity2 divorced again and met third husband @entity163			1
by then two of her sons had become fathers and @entity2 was already starting to avoid the babies through fear they would be sick			1
‘ i knew i had been a terrible mother and i did n’t want to repeat my mistakes but i could feel history was repeating			0
' i was desperate to be a good grandmother and have my grandchildren come to stay but once again my fear was controlling my life			0
’ eventually she broke down and admitted to her husband why she was so afraid of spending time with her grandchildren			0
‘ it was the first time anyone had listened and understood			0
he promised to help me and i do n’t know it is simply a case of sharing the load , but since i started being honest with my family i feel more in control			0
‘ my family was relieved , my odd behaviour over the past 46 years finally made sense and i have said sorry to my sons			0
‘ i was determined fear would not stop me being a grandmother			0
' now @entity2 can spend time with her grandchildren and even enjoy a meal in a restaurant and has written a book about her journey			1
‘ there are other sufferers out there , and i want them to know they are not alone			0
‘ now it ’s still a struggle but it ’s much easier			0
there ’s a long way to go but i will get there			0
