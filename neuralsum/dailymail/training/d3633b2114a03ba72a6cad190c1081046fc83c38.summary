by @entity0 in @entity1 and @entity2 published : 07:51 est , 21 september 2012 updated : 09:06 est , 21 september 2012 it might not be many people 's idea of a place to call home			2
but the pub where @entity9 was born in the @entity11 town of @entity12 could now be turned into flats after developers submitted plans to the local council			1
the mayor of @entity18 , @entity17 , who opposes alternative proposals for a @entity21 museum at the site , believes turning the @entity23 into family homes would be one way of ' destigmatising ' the town			1
plans : developers want to turn the former @entity23 where @entity9 was born ( pictured ) into apartments as it was : pictured in 1966 , the building had been , variously , a girl 's school and a public library , after @entity35 most recently it has been used as a centre for disabled people nationality : @entity9 's birthplace is just a short distance from the @entity42 border			0
the @entity44 leader returned to annex and occupy his homeland during the ' @entity46 ' in 1938 if the plan - approved by the mayor and proposed by a local building consortium - was accepted it would mean the room where @entity9 was born would become a bedroom in self - contained apartments with state - of - the - art kitchens and bathrooms			1
the apartments would go on the market for an estimated 400,000 pounds each			0
such a plan , say experts , would require vigorous vetting of prospective buyers to ensure that a single flat - or indeed the entire property - did not fall into the hands of neo-nazis masking their real identities			0
the little @entity11 town separated from @entity42 by a short bridge over the @entity66 , is still visited by hordes of far - right fanatics each year who come to pay homage at the site where the future @entity72 was born on april 20 1889			1
it was until recently used as a workshop for the mentally and physically disabled ; the sort of people @entity9 deemed as ' useless eaters ' and the first to die in the @entity44 's secret euthanasia campaign before @entity35			2
but it has been empty for a year now with the state picking up the bill for the lease and a debate raging about what to do with the two - storey listed building			0
mayor @entity17 said : ' @entity18 has done much to process its history over the years			1
' it is not necessary to build a @entity21 museum in the house as some have suggested			0
' @entity18 as a town is already stigmatised enough			1
' @entity9 spent only three years of his life here , and they were certainly not the most formative years of his life			0
' why should i or others take responsibility for him ? i was born 21 years after the end of the war			2
' the mayor said he was open to all suggestions , saying @entity18 wants an ' affordable solution for all			1
' ' i can imagine all possibilities for the house , ' he said			0
marker : a memorial stone ( pictured ) was placed outside the building in 1989 as a reminder of its history			0
in @entity116 the inscription reads ' @entity117			0
millions of @entity119 [ us ] ' past : mayor @entity17 supports the plan for apartments - saying it would help ' de-stigmatise ' the town however , mayor @entity126 is against turning the building into a ' @entity128 ' or a ' @entity129 ' as @entity131 members have advocated - believing the town has done enough atoning over the years for its most infamous son			1
already the newspapers in @entity11 and @entity42 are having a field day at the prospect of flats in @entity9 's house			1
' in the future you can live like @entity9 , ' said the @entity11 newspaper @entity141 while the salzburger @entity142 said ; ' @entity9 's home to become apartment block			1
' the house at @entity146 15 is estimated to be worth about £ 2.5 million to £ 3 million			0
it was in a room on the first floor of the three - storey , 2,000 square foot premises that @entity9 ’s mother @entity151 gave birth to the future @entity44 leader			1
she and her husband @entity155 , a stern local customs official , rented a suite of rooms above the pub and continued to live in it until 1892 when they moved to @entity161			2
@entity155 , a drunkard , often availed himself of the beer on sale in the saloon downstairs before returning to the family home to abuse his timid wife who was 24 years his junior			0
the house is still owned by the family after which the pub took its name			0
@entity18 @entity173 owner @entity174 says she wants to sell because she no longer wants to have responsibility for it			2
nothing remains inside the building to indicate its link with @entity9 , not even the bedroom where he was born			0
the only @entity44 - era relic is on an iron gate outside , the initials mb for @entity9 ’s party secretary @entity184 , who had them placed there when he declared the house a national monument after @entity9 took over @entity11 in 1938			1
during the 12 year lifespan of the @entity44 it was a must - see place of pilgrimage for loyal @entity192			1
@entity184 bought the house with @entity44 funds and made it a cultural centre which displayed @entity44 - approved art. it was given back to the @entity174 family in 1952 and served as the town ’s public library until 1965 before becoming , in turns , a school , a bank , a technical institute and finally the home and workshop for disabled people			2
those who want it turned into a site of remembrance for @entity9 's crimes are pressing central government in @entity213 to compulsorily purchase the property .			0

@entity44 leader was born in the pub in @entity18 in @entity11 in 1889
