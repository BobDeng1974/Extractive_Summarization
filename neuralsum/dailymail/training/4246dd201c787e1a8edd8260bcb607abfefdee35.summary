by @entity0 @entity2 's landscape has featured in countless images over the years but none can evoke what it 's really like to be among the bustling crowds of the city centre , or to sit under the trees in @entity9			2
to try and capture the unique sounds of the city , archivist @entity10 has created the @entity13 - an online collection of field recordings , sound maps , early @entity18 radio actuality and more			1
as part of this project , @entity10 travelled @entity2 's canals and rivers during during 2011 and 2012 recording ambient sounds along the way and has plotted these on his @entity28 - inspired @entity27 map			1
click the image below to listen to the original recordings ( opens in a new tab ) @entity10 travelled along @entity32 , @entity34 canal , @entity35 and more			1
each waterway was assigned a colour from the @entity28 map although the map follows @entity2 ’s canals and smaller rivers , noises from other landmarks including the @entity43 bridge , @entity44 and @entity45 are also featured			1
the recordings are grouped together based by location and tube lines			0
to use the map , click a placeholder name to listen to the recording			0
as the recording plays , the file details are shown above the map			2
these details include how long the clip is , the date and time it was recorded , the location and a brief description about what can be heard			1
click play to listen to the sounds of @entity62 , the @entity43 bridge and @entity44 to listen to a recording , users can click a placeholder name , such as @entity62 , pictured left , to listen to the ambient sounds around that location			1
the recording of @entity62 , stock image pictured right , was recorded on 15 july 2011 at 6.15am and features a narrowboat 's propeller churning through the water for example , the @entity45 recording was taken on 9 july 2011 at 11am			1
it was recorded by @entity32 at @entity45 , @entity80 , in east @entity2 and includes ‘ loud birdsong from nearby trees and buddleia bushes , traffic in background , a bicycle passes making a noise on loose concrete paving slabs			0
’ @entity10 travelled along canals , brooks and more			2
each waterway has been assigned a colour from the @entity28 map ‘ listening to a recording of the sounds of a place or event gets the imagination working and recreates some of the sense of being there , ’ explained @entity10			1
‘ it feels like a worthwhile end in itself simply to share those experiences with whoever 's willing to listen			0
’ @entity10 got the idea for the project while working at the @entity104			0
describing why he feels sound is the best way to document the city , @entity10 told @entity108 : ‘ i ’d lived away from @entity2 for about ten years and found it hard to settle for a while when i moved back			2
' @entity2 struck me as very anonymous and indifferent			0
literary attempts to describe the city as an organism or having some sort of enduring spirit just seemed fanciful			0
’ @entity10 admitted that the @entity117 is one of his favourite places because ‘ you get a mixture of industry , scraps of marshland , housing , and seemingly un-owned bits of land which are used for scrambler bikes and clay - pigeon shooting ’ , along with @entity129 that has a ‘ wide array of soundscapes because it ’s the pole star of @entity134 culture in @entity2 and there are several indoor and street markets			2
' the recordings are grouped based on where they were taken			0
for example , locations along the @entity141 , pictured , are shown along the green line , which would traditionally represent the @entity144 on the original tube map			0

@entity13 was set up by sound archivist @entity10
during 2011 and 2012 he travelled @entity2 ’s waterways recording sounds
recordings are plotted on an image inspired by the @entity28 map
locations include @entity62 , @entity157 , @entity43 bridge and @entity44
each recording details the time , date , location and sound *inforamtion*
