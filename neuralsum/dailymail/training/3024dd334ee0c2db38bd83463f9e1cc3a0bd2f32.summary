by @entity0 it seems that fans of the @entity3 do n’t just care about the cake – they ’re sticklers for hygiene too			1
as the hit show returned to our screens this week , viewers took to @entity11 to complain about the unruly hair of some contestants			1
an average audience of 7.2million watched on wednesday night – a record for an opening episode of the show , and an increase of 600,000 on the first programme in last year ’s series			1
construction engineer @entity23 , 31 , was criticised for his thick beard , while it manager @entity39 , 33 , was singled out for his long , wavy hair and stubble			2
@entity42 tweeted : ‘ ca n’t stand these beards and unwashed hair on @entity3			1
no. you ca n’t cook if you ai n’t got your hygiene sorted			0
’ @entity47 added : ‘ surely that @entity3 beard is against hygiene rules ? ’ another fan , writing under the name @entity51 , said : ‘ wish the @entity53 would enforce to the correct hygiene rules in relation to hair , jewellery and clothing , there ’s hair everywhere			1
’ and @entity61 said : ‘ wish that bloke would shave that beard			1
not to mention unhygienic for a cooking show			0
’ @entity66 , 17 , left , is the show 's youngest baker , while @entity68 , 31 , right , was the first to go chef and hygiene expert @entity69 , who runs food safety consultancy @entity71 , said beards were ‘ frowned upon ’ in the industry			1
‘ not only is there a greater risk of physical contamination from hairs that drop down into what you are preparing , beards also give off the wrong impression to those who are about to eat the food , ’ he said			0
‘ they look untidy , and if you ca n’t maintain a tidy appearance you are unlikely to produce nice - looking food			2
most restaurants or supermarkets insist their chefs are either clean shaven or wear a covering over their beards			0
‘ @entity93 is sending out the wrong message by allowing its contestants to cook in that state			2
’ not all viewers objected to the facial hair , however			0
some said mr @entity23 ’ beard was ‘ lovely ’ and ‘ formidable ’ , and he quickly built up a following of female fans			2
many have hailed this series , the fifth , as the most diverse yet with the youngest - ever contestant , 17 - year - old schoolgirl @entity66 , and the oldest , @entity103 , 69			1
meanwhile fashion designer @entity108 , 35 , is from @entity109 , and moved to the @entity110 in 2003 and @entity111 , 39 , was raised in @entity112 but is half - @entity113 and half - @entity114			0

a viewer writing under the name @entity121 , tweeted : ‘ i love the diversity on the @entity3			1
goes to show that anyone can bake			0
’ happy tweet : @entity3 judge @entity27 was told about the 7.9million viewers today - and tweeted his thanks as @entity3 contestants struggled to recreate @entity29 ’s cherry cake in the first technical challenge of the new series , viewers rushed to buy the same cake tin used on the show			1
in a remarkable sign of the impact of the popular tv cook , online retailer @entity134 reported that sales of a similar tin , the @entity139 non-stick round fluted cake pan , rose by 1,003 per cent as the show was being broadcast			0
budding bakers also ordered 54 per cent more hand and stand mixers during the hour - long show compared to the same time last week			1
and sales of general bakeware , such as sieves and spatulas , rose by 43 per cent on the week before			0
' have we bitten off more than we can choux ? ' hilarious @entity154 @entity11 exchange the night before the show launched , @entity3 fans who had one eye on @entity11 enjoyed a jokey exchange between the @entity11 accounts for @entity159 , the show 's former home , and @entity162			1
first the @ @entity164 account tweeted : ' goodbye , @entity3			2
have a great time on @ @entity162			2

' tweet that started it : first the @ @entity164 account tweeted this message the night before @entity3 started to which the @ @entity162 account replied : ' bless you , two			1
we hope we have n't bitten off more than we can choux			0
' @entity159 shot back with : ' it 's ok , one			2
you 're bready for this			0
' and a steady stream of baking - related puns ensued			0
