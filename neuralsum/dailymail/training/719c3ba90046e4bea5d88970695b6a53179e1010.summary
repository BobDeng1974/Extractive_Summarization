it was n’t quite one of the gruelling 75 - minute work - outs @entity3 has warned his @entity5 team - mates about , but @entity6 was still his usual uncompromising self as @entity7 trained on friday			1
@entity8 frightened a few in the @entity11 dressing room this week when he described how @entity12 would be on their backs every minute during ‘ enormously intense ’ training sessions			1
but on the evidence of the final @entity18 practice before saturday night 's @entity20 warm - up with @entity21 , it will be some of his more unorthodox techniques that will unsettle them			1
unfortunately , the circle nearest to @entity12 were n’t especially good and every time the ball hit the ground , he would despatch them unceremoniously back to the start with an outstretched finger and a look of disdain			2
during a 40 - minute small - sided game , it was imperative that @entity12 ’s team - containing former @entity58 striker @entity57 , now at @entity60 , and @entity61 goalkeeper @entity56 - won			1
a whistle permanently resting between his lips , he pointed , prodded and posed searching questions until they finally got their act together and scored the decisive goals			0
at one point , @entity69 centre back @entity67 turned away from his manager , wincing with pain , and poured cold water down his shorts			0
the agony was n’t inflicted by @entity12 - not on this occasion - but the must - win mentality clearly stretches down to even the smallest of games			2
when not snapping and snarling , @entity12 stood aloof in one of two default stances			2
the one with the arms folded and the one with the hands plunged deep in his pockets			0
something wrong ? @entity67 ( right ) looks in discomfort as he turns away both , allied with a stern and unchanging expression , leave it clear that this is a meticulous coach who sees everything and demands the highest standards			0
there was delegation for the warm - ups , to assistants @entity98 and @entity99 , but once @entity12 strode up , there was no doubting who was in charge			2
there was some fun , too , but only at the very end			0
when @entity107 finally emerged victors , @entity12 lined them up in celebratory pose and pretended to take a picture of them			1
it was probably more of a show for the 5,000 - strong crowd - the vast majority kitted out in oranje , naturally - who had gathered at the @entity31 for a public training session			0
@entity12 was cheered to the echo whenever he kicked a ball and the consensus was that he ’s perhaps leaving for @entity121 too soon			2
but that opinion may change if @entity7 fail to advance beyond a tricky @entity20 group containing @entity124 , @entity125 and @entity126			1
crowd : @entity7 supporters packed in to @entity69 's home stadium @entity31 to watch the training session @entity131 : @entity3 and @entity12 have a word during training in @entity32 their form has n’t been great since completing qualification unbeaten with a 2 - 0 win over @entity138 back in october , the subsequent friendlies comprising of draws with @entity140 , @entity141 and @entity142 , and a defeat to @entity144			1
@entity12 will cut his 29 - man provisional squad - reduced after @entity147 pulled out with a calf injury - to 23 on monday , so the @entity21 match is a last chance to impress			1
he will reshuffle his team , with @entity8 leading a three - pronged attack alongside @entity153 and @entity154 , and @entity156 ’s @entity155 in midfield			0
@entity12 has been here before and not prospered			2
he was in charge when @entity159 beat them to qualification for the 2002 finals and @entity57 believes that failure is his primary motivation			0
he told @entity165 : ‘ the disappointment of 2001 has made him stronger			0
he will do anything to achieve success this time			0
‘ i think @entity12 is a very experienced top trainer who knows exactly what is required to perform in @entity172			1
he knows exactly what he wants and has been a champion in many different countries			0
’ challenge : the @entity5 striker is tackled by central defender @entity178 pass and move : @entity153 , @entity179 and @entity8 take part in a training exercise			1

@entity6 pretends to take picture of his players in training
@entity7 team train in @entity32 ahead of @entity20
@entity12 will take over as @entity5 manager after @entity172
