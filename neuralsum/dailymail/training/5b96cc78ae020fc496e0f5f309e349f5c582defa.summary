by @entity0 hitting the high seas for a day of sailing requires a lot of kit , but now there ’s a compact dingy that can fit in the boot of a car			2
a @entity10 company has created what it claims to be the first high performance inflatable sailing dinghy for water sports that can travel at high speeds on a windy day			1
the @entity15 3.2 weighs just 111 lbs ( 50kg ) and folds away into two bags that can easily fit in the boot of a car			0
the dinghy ’s ‘ versatile design allows for both high performance solo use and leisure sailing in pairs , ’ the company said			1
the boat measures just over three metres in length and has a sail measuring 56 square feet ( 5.2 metres squared ) – and a larger 75 square feet ( 7.2 square metres ) size is also available			0
the @entity15 3.2 weighs just 50kg and folds away into two bags that can easily fit in the boot of a car ( pictured ) it is designed to be used competitively in rough waters as well as for leisurely trips for multiple sailors on calm seas			2
using its sails , the dinghy can reach a top speed of around 13 mph ( 22 km / h ) which , according to @entity61 is double the speed of other dinghies on the market			1
‘ it ’s a leisure boat , a boat for thrills and a multi-purpose vessel , ’ the company said			2
the vessel has a v - shaped underbody and claims to be more stable than conventional rigid dinghys , as well as a boomless sail with high clearance so that sailors have maximum mobility on deck			0
the dinghy 's creators , based in @entity38 , north - west @entity10 , claim the whole inflatable vessel can be assembled ( pictured ) in just 20 minutes the boat measures just over three metres in length and has a sail that is slightly larger than five metres squared and a larger seven metres squared size is also available the wide underbody also allows the dingy to accelerate quickly to reach planing speed – when a boat 's centre of gravity moves up so there is less resistance from waves - in three to four force winds , which is a light to moderate breeze			1
in the event of capsizing , the boat can be righted by facing it into the wind and pushing the underwater wing down , while pulling on the daggerboard			0
the boat can be stored in two bags , each weighing 62lbs ( 28kg ) which are designed to be easy to stored – perhaps even in a cubby hole of a larger yacht			0

the @entity15 3.2 costs € 5,490 ( £ 4,521 ) for the vessel with a smaller sized sail and € 5,840 ( £ 4,809 ) for the model with the seven metre sail , although ironically shipping costs have to be negotiated with the company			0
the compact yacht is light enough to be carried to the water by two people , although the company is also rolling out a trolley so that one person can handle the craft - from the boot of their car to the sea - independently the boat can be stored in two bags ( pictured ) each weighing 28 kilograms , which are designed to be easy to store - perhaps even in a cubby hole of a larger yacht			1
