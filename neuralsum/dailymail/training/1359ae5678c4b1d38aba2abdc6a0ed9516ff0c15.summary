it was third time lucky for @entity2 who today launched an observatory toward a solar - storm lookout point a million miles away			1
the unmanned @entity7 rocket blasted off at 6:03pm est from @entity8 in @entity9 in perfect weather conditions			1
high seas , however , prompted @entity2 to cancel a test that would have landed the rocket 's discarded first stage on a platform in the ocean			1
' rocket soft landed in the ocean within 10m of target & nicely vertical ! high probability of good droneship landing in non-stormy weather , ' tweeted @entity32			2
' we are experiencing just such weather in the @entity35 with waves reaching up to three stories in height crashing over the decks , ' @entity2 said in a statement			1
' also , only three of the drone ship 's four engines are functioning , making station - keeping in the face of such wave action extremely difficult			0
' the rocket will still attempt a soft landing in the water through the storm ( producing valuable landing data ) , but survival is highly unlikely			0
' this time , the wind stayed within safety limits and everything else went @entity2 's way - at least for launch the unmanned @entity7 rocket blasted off on the third try in four days , hoisting the spacecraft for @entity61 sending the @entity19 ( @entity63 ) satellite observatory on its $ 340 million mission was the main event of this launch			1
@entity63 ( pronounced discover ) is designed to provide advance warnings of solar outbursts that could disrupt life here on @entity71			1
@entity63 will spend nearly four months traveling one million miles , four times farther than the moon , to the so - called @entity73 , a gravity - neutral position in direct line with the sun. at this lookout location , 92 million miles from the sun , it will provide advance warnings of incoming geomagnetic storms that could disrupt power and communications on @entity71 , beginning around midsummer			1
the steady stream of @entity71 pictures , meanwhile , is expected to be high on the ' wow ' factor			2
the observatory 's camera will provide the first snapshots of the entire home planet , its full face lit by the sun , since @entity61 's final @entity93 moon - landing in 1972			0
subsequent @entity71 views have been stitched together from multiple images			0
sending the @entity63 observatory on its $ 340 million mission was the main event			1
it represented the first deep - space mission for @entity2			1
@entity63 replaces a 17 - year - old satellite monitoring for potentially dangerous solar storms , which can disrupt gps signals , block radio communications and impact power grids on @entity71			1
it will take @entity63 110 days to reach its operational orbit around the sun. where it will serve as a weather buoy , providing about an hour 's advance notice of threatening solar activity			2
@entity63 also has two sensors to monitor @entity71 to track volcanic plumes , measure ozone and monitor droughts , flooding and fires			2
former vice president @entity118 - who dreamed up the idea for an environmentally conscious , @entity71 - gazing satellite 17 years ago - returned for the sunset launch			1
he was at the previous two attempts as well , eager to see his brainchild finally soar			0
@entity2 said there will be many other opportunities this year for test			0
dangerously high winds kept the deep - space observatory grounded yesterday and put off a radically new landing test of the booster rocket			1
@entity2 called off its sunset launch with just 12 minutes remaining in the countdown because of gusts of 115 mph several miles up - strong enough to damage the rocket in flight			2
last - minute radar trouble foiled sunday 's launch effort , then @entity2 skipped monday because of heavy rain			2
and last month 's inaugural test ended in flames after the launch of a supply run to the @entity143			0
with three hours remaining in the countdown , @entity2 called off the radical landing test of the first - stage booster			2
it would have been just the second such experiment ; last month 's try ended in flames when the booster slammed into the platform , fell over and exploded			0

@entity2 added extra hydraulic fluid for the guidance fins this time			0
but @entity32 and others warned the landing would be harder to nail because of the booster 's higher incoming speed from 80 miles up			0
musk - whose @entity22 company delivers supplies to the @entity143 and aims to haul astronauts as well in two years - wants to start retrieving and reusing his rockets to save time and money			0
first - stage boosters normally just slam into the @entity35 and sink			2
@entity32 recently unveiled the images of the @entity7 failed landing after persuasion on @entity200 by the game pioneer behind @entity202 , @entity203			0
the images show the rocket approaching the barge following last month 's attempt			0
after it fails to reduce its speed , the rocket is seen crashing at an angle and exploding			0
@entity212 described the event simply as a ' rapid unscheduled disassembly '			0
saturday 's mission was the group 's first to put the stage on an autonomous landing platform at sea , which was held in position using deep - sea oil rigs			1
pictured is an image of the fuel and oxygen combining in an explosion			0

@entity228 took place at 6:03pm from @entity230 in @entity9
@entity7 is sending the @entity63 satellite on its $ 340 million mission
@entity118 - inspired satellite is designed to keep tabs on solar storms
@entity2 wanted to land the largest stage of its rocket back on @entity71
but this plan had to be *scrapped* *due* to huge waves in the @entity35
high winds kept the deep - space observatory grounded yesterday
