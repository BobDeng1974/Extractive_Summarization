militants fighting for the @entity2 in @entity3 have abandoned a key military base in their stronghold @entity6 after the @entity7 announced a massive operation to retake the city , it has been claimed			1
intensified airstrikes on the terror group 's western @entity3 stronghold have seen hundreds of jihadis flee their main base in the south of the oil rich city , according local media reports			1
@entity18 captured @entity6 last summer in the group 's lightning advance across vast swathes of @entity22 and @entity3 , which led to the @entity24 extremist group declaring itself a caliphate and the terrorists ' leader @entity26 delivering a filmed sermon in the city 's main mosque			1
news of the withdrawal came after a senior @entity7 military official announced a massive operation to retake @entity3 's second - largest city using up to 25,000 @entity3 troops will likely begin in april or may			1
the @entity7 is planning a massive operation to retake the city in april or may sprawling terror : news of the offensive comes amid reports @entity18 is facing a growing number of defections and cases of corruption in its ranks in two of its major strongholds , @entity6 and @entity60 news that @entity18 had abandoned the military base was first reported by @entity63 yesterday			1
it comes just days after @entity7 officials took the surprising step of announcing details of their joint operation with the @entity69 to retake the country 's second largest city from @entity2 militants in just a few months			1
@entity3 officials continue to insist they have n't gotten the advanced weapons they need for the operation , and some question whether they will be ready for a spring offensive			1
but the @entity78 insists the @entity7 has sent tens of thousands of weapons and ammunition and more is in the pipeline			0
@entity82 , the head of the security and defense committee in the @entity3 parliament , told the @entity86 friday that ' any operation would be fruitless ' unless the brigades are properly prepared and have the weapons they need			2
' i think if these weapons are not made available soon , the military assault might wait beyond spring , ' he said			0
' the @entity7 might have their own calculations and estimations , but we as @entity3 have our own opinion			2
we are fighting and moving on the ground , so we have better vision and april might be too soon			0
' a @entity101 official provided some details of the battle plan on thursday , saying the coordinated military mission to retake @entity6 will likely begin in april or may and will involve up to 25,000 @entity3 troops			1
they have cautioned , however , that if the @entity3 are n't ready , the timing could be delayed			0
the operation to retake @entity6 should begin in april or may utilising 12 @entity3 brigades made up of between 20,000 and 25,000 troops @entity18 captured @entity6 last summer in the group 's lightning advance across vast swathes of @entity22 and @entity3 @entity18 leader @entity26 delivered a filmed sermon in @entity6 's main mosque last summer the core of the fighting force will be five of @entity3 's most accomplished brigades , who will go through additional @entity7 training before the operation			1
but @entity82 said that while several of @entity3 's units have gone through training recently , ' these well - trained brigades can not get involved in battles without being equipped with advanced and effective weapons that would enable them to penetrate enemy lines			0
' his comment reflects a common complaint from the @entity3 government , both in recent months and throughout much of the @entity3 war			0
the @entity7 , however , has sent tens of thousands of weapons , ammunition , body armor and other equipment to the country			0
according to a senior defense official , the @entity7 sent nearly 1,600 hellfire missiles to @entity3 last year , and has already delivered 232 more			2
about 10,000 m - 16 assault rifles are due to arrive in the next few weeks , along with 23,000 ammunition magazines			0

the public discussion of the operation , including how many @entity3 brigades would be involved and how @entity179 @entity149 military would be used , triggered questions about whether it provided any key information to the enemy			2
the @entity78 does n't often disclose as much about an operation before it takes place , but in some cases it can be a strategic tactic intended to affect the enemy , trigger a reaction or even prompt some militants to flee before the assault begins			0
military officials also said none of the information released by @entity101 could be put to any operational use by the @entity2 militants			0
the operation itself comes as no surprise to the @entity201			0
@entity3 leaders have for months made it publicly clear that they were planning an operation to retake @entity6 and that they were eager to get started			2
in addition , @entity7 officials had already acknowledged they were beginning preparations for the @entity6 mission , including using airstrikes to shut down supply lines the insurgents were using to get equipment or people in and out of the city .			1

@entity18 militants began fleeing key base near @entity6 stronghold yesterday
the terror group have been hit by sustained airstrikes in recent weeks
news comes days @entity7 revealed massive operation to recapture @entity6
25,000 @entity3 troops will lead an operation to force @entity18 out of the city
but there is *concern* that the *announcement* may be *premature* and the @entity3 army are unlikely to be prepared in time for the spring offensive
