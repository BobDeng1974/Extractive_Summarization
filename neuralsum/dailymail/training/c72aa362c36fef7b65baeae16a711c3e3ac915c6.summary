by @entity0 published : 09:45 est , 11 october 2013 updated : 09:54 est , 11 october 2013 hard - left union leader @entity1 has praised @entity2 as @entity4 ’s best leader since @entity5			1
the @entity7 chief used a speech to hail him as the most radical leader since 1983 , the year of @entity4 ’s ‘ longest suicide note in history ’ manifesto and worst election result since the @entity14			1
and he gloated over the fact that under mr @entity2 , @entity4 and the centre - left policies pioneered by triple election - winning @entity17 had been abandoned			1
comparison : unite boss @entity1 praised @entity2 ( left ) as @entity4 ’s best leader since @entity5 @entity20 : mr @entity5 was responsible for @entity4 ’s ‘ longest suicide note in history ’ manifesto and worst election result since the @entity14 the trenchant speech will raise fears over mr @entity1 ’s influence over the @entity4 leader , dubbed @entity2 by critics			1
unite is one of the largest trade unions , and the unions are responsible for three quarters of @entity4 ’s funding			1
mr @entity1 gave the lecture in memory of @entity38 , a left - wing activist who led a group of dockers who took over shipyards on the @entity43 in 1971			0
he praised @entity2 ’s speech to last month ’s @entity4 conference , when he promised 1970s - style price controls for energy bills and suggested developers who refuse to build on their land should see it confiscated by the state			1
‘ we should ask if the glass is filling up or draining way , ’ he said			0
‘ put like that , the answer can not really be in doubt			0
‘ @entity2 ’s speech to the @entity4 conference was – some would say – the most genuinely radical we have heard from a @entity4 leader for nigh on 30 years			1
’ thirty years ago , @entity5 led his party to a historic defeat , losing three million votes since the 1979 election			2
his successor , @entity66 , started the slow process of moving @entity4 towards the centre ground and making it more electable			2
attack : @entity1 hailed the death of @entity4 in his speech mr @entity1 went on : ‘ to say that the next @entity4 government will not let the energy monopolies carry on ripping us off , to say that the property speculators will no longer be able to stop our kids getting a decent roof over their heads , and to tell the biggest companies that they are going to have to pay more tax – that is not just a break with the @entity84 ’s policies , it also represents @entity4 turning its back on the neo-liberal dogmas which dominated the @entity87 years			1
‘ so i unequivocally welcome @entity2 ’s speech			2
@entity89 to his brave stance over @entity91 – a stance which flew in the face of the unsolicited advice of @entity17 and which i believe has saved lived by stopping a global rush to war – there is no doubt that this is no longer “ @entity4 ” as we knew it			2
’ mr @entity1 said , however , that the ‘ critical question ’ – more important than any social policies @entity4 might introduce – was what the party was planning to do about ‘ trade union freedom ’			2
‘ i do not say that just because i ’m a trade union leader , but because i believe that social progress is maybe 25 per cent the work of government , and 75 per cent the job of working - class self - organisation , ’ he said			0
pressure : mr @entity2 , pictured today in @entity112 , @entity113 , was accused of demoting @entity4 figures in this week 's reshuffle the unite general secretary said calls to break the link between @entity4 and the unions was a ‘ right - wing agenda ’ , saying : ‘ that ’s what lies behind the incessant attacks on our political work by the @entity125 and the media , and the unfortunate echo those attacks sometimes find within the @entity129 itself			1
’ in a menacing section of his speech , he suggested that the working classes should ‘ take over ’ society			0
he said : ‘ @entity38 believed that a better society could be achieved if people were willing to fight for it			0
it is a belief i have always shared			0
‘ @entity38 said – at the time of the @entity140 work - in – “ we are taking over the yards because we refuse to accept that faceless men can make these decisions ”			0
‘ substitute the word “ society ” for “ the yards ” and we have an outlook as relevant today as it was then			0
’ last night a @entity125 source said : ‘ the union barons have given 75 per cent of @entity4 ’s cash under @entity2			1
‘ they oppose cutting the deficit , they oppose fixing the welfare system and they oppose every difficult decision we ’ve taken to fix our economy			0
with the union barons in charge , @entity4 have n’t changed			2
it ’s the same old @entity4			0
