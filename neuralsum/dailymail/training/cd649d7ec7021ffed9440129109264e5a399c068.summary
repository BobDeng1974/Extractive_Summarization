by @entity0 when the final whistle sounded and @entity4 's place in the 2005 final of the @entity6 was secure , there was only one thing i wanted to do			1
it was n't to join the rest of my delirious team - mates , who were dancing in front of the @entity13			2
i did n't even want to run to the part of @entity15 where i knew my family and friends would be , even though this was one of the biggest moments of my career			2
no. the celebrating could wait			0
my initial thought after that energy - sapping and emotionally draining collision with @entity22 was over was to go and shake hands with @entity25 , who - like me - had given every last ounce to try to get his team to @entity28			1
@entity25 , of course , was distraught to get so close but i just wanted to tell him how good he had been			1
we played the game the same way and that night in may 2005 we were like two boxers at the final bell			0
as @entity4 and @entity22 's rivalry escalated , i remember @entity54 saying to me ' how lucky ' @entity55 was to have a player such as @entity25			1
i quickly told him he was lucky to have me and @entity54 replied , pulling his hand away from his nose to mimic @entity59 : ' yes , yes ! you 're as good as @entity25 ! ' not to be beaten , i replied with the same gesture : ' yes , yes ! you 're as good as @entity55 ! ' but i could understand what @entity54 meant			2
@entity25 had this ability to draw the ball to him like a magnet , always getting his head or his foot in the way just when it mattered			2
@entity25 was a better version of me and his form was one of the main reasons i retired from @entity75			1
those games took place almost nine years ago but the passing of time has not impacted on the quality of performance @entity25 is still producing			2
if you asked me to select an all - time @entity83 , he would be the first pick at the heart of my defence			1
some outstanding central defenders have graced the @entity83 , such as @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 and @entity94 - players with the medals to match their talent			1
@entity25 , however , is the pick of the bunch			1
he is the only defender since @entity99 in 1993 to be named @entity100 and i do n't believe it has ever been appreciated what a consistently outstanding operator he has been			2
i accept it might be controversial to praise him , given some of the off - field controversies he has been embroiled in			0
they have been dissected at length on these pages			0
i just feel that the way he is viewed obscures his playing qualities			0
head and shoulders above the rest : @entity25 beats @entity113 's @entity112 to an aerial ball good @entity115 : @entity116 skipper @entity94 is one of the @entity83 's best defenders just consider this : he was a fixture in the @entity120 at one stage , selected by his fellow professionals every season from 2005 to 2009			1
when you consider the talent that was around during that period , his consistency was remarkable			0
equally remarkable was @entity22 's ' goals against ' column in their first title - winning season of 2004 - 05			2
they conceded only 15 in 38 games , a record i do not expect to be broken			0
@entity25 , with his durability and his quality , was instrumental in driving @entity55 's men forward			1
such attributes continue to serve him well - he is one of only five outfield players to appear in every minute of the 23 @entity142 games this season			0
centre of attention : @entity88 ( left ) and @entity92 both had medals to match their talents putting his head where it hurts : @entity91 ( left ) was the leader of @entity152 's first great @entity151 team @entity153 of class : @entity90 was superb at the heart of @entity157 's defence @entity89 the rock : @entity89 was @entity25 's partner at @entity22 and was a vital component of their defence but on monday night he will be aware that his biggest match of the campaign awaits			1
walking out at the @entity163 as a defender must feel like you are heading into the @entity166			0
@entity167 will be missing , but when he 's not causing problems , @entity169 and @entity170 are , so it will be intriguing to see how @entity22 and @entity25 try to contain @entity116			1
at this moment , a trip to the @entity163 is the most daunting challenge for a defender in @entity176 football			2
@entity151 went there with a fine record yet conceded six			0
@entity180 's goal difference was decimated the day they also got hit for six , while @entity157 were thrashed by four			2
leap of faith : @entity25 ( right ) shows no sign of declining like some other notable top - flight centre halves still up for the challenge : @entity25 is scrutinised more because he is not very popular away from @entity186 i still hear @entity25 being criticised for a lack of pace but very few centre backs are quick ; @entity25 's reading of the game is outstanding and keeps him out of danger , while his ability on the ball never gets spoken about ; how many defenders in world football can switch the play with their weaker foot ? critics have been quick to write him off , particularly last season when he started only 14 times in the @entity83 , but some of what has been said about him is nonsense ; as soon as he has a bad game , it gets mentioned that he is over 30 and is n't the same as he was			1
@entity209 and @entity88 , for instance , have suffered the same injury and form issues yet never get the same level of criticism			1
@entity25 gets such scrutiny because outside @entity186 , he does n't enjoy any popularity			1
no going back : despite his good form , @entity25 should not return for @entity75 he remains @entity75 's best in his position but i do n't believe for a minute @entity221 should think about enticing him back to be part of his @entity224 squad - there is too much history there			1
nor do i think @entity25 would be well served ending his international retirement			1
clearly he is benefitting from a lesser workload and that will help prolong his career			0
@entity22 are looking to the future , as their signing of @entity234 shows , but they should offer @entity25 a new deal , given how he has served them			2
and , more importantly , what he can continue to give them			0
@entity237 continued his brilliant form in midweek with two goals in a fixture that should cement a @entity4 striker 's place in @entity13 affections			1
i was at @entity15 on tuesday and , once again , @entity237 made a big impression on me - he is playing with such confidence that you do n't expect him to miss when he gets a chance - but , for some reason , i did n't hear his name being sung during the 4 - 0 win over @entity251			1
it left me wondering : when are @entity4 and @entity75 supporters going to start appreciating his exploits ? he 's scored 27 goals in 34 appearances since he joined @entity4 12 months ago			1
that 's a phenomenal ratio but it still feels at times that he has question marks hanging over him			0
no @entity13 idol : @entity237 ( right ) has a brilliant record for @entity4 but seems unloved by the fans @entity264 destroyer : @entity237 scored twice on tuesday as @entity4 beat @entity251 4 - 0 at @entity15 on a bad day , he can look lethargic and when he first joined @entity4 , i wondered whether he would spend a lot of time in the treatment room			1
but in the past year , he has played regularly and has been one of the top players in the @entity83			2
@entity271 has been hailed for his excellent form this season and has scored nine goals in 18 @entity83 games but @entity237 's figures are even better , with 13 goals in 15 league appearances			1
his consistency in the penalty area has been faultless			0
if he continues in this vein , @entity4 will have an outstanding chance of finishing in the top four			1
and if he carries it into the summer , @entity75 's hopes at the @entity224 will be significantly improved too			1
1 @entity285 : @entity286 can be razor - sharp with his replies , as was highlighted after a 3 - 3 draw with @entity157 in 1988			0
sir @entity289 was complaining to radio reporters about decisions that had gone against his team			0
@entity286 walked past , holding his baby daughter @entity293 , and simply said : ' you 'll get more sense out of her than him			0
' speaking their mind : @entity152 ( left ) and @entity285 have both been partial to the odd amusing quip 2 @entity152 : when @entity289 claimed @entity157 were the better team in the 2002 title race , @entity151 's boss had this reply : ' everyone thinks they have the prettiest wife at home			0
' 3 @entity289 : i loved @entity289 's press conferences , as he 'd always come out with a jewel			0
i remember one about @entity152 : ' they say he 's an intelligent man , right ? speaks five languages			0
i 've got a 15 - year - old boy from the @entity312 here who speaks five languages ! ' jewel : sir @entity289 was good value in his press conferences as manager of @entity157 4 @entity317 : @entity113 's manager had his tongue in his cheek when , ahead of a game with @entity116 in 2012 , he was asked if he saw himself competing at @entity6 level			0
his reply ? ' i wo n't ever be going to a top - four club because i 'm not called @entity325 , just @entity317			2
' 5 @entity55 : this list would not be complete without a quip from the @entity22 manager			0
this was his reply in 2006 to whether he was feeling pressure in the title race : ' for me , pressure is bird flu ; i am feeling a lot of pressure with the swan in @entity340			0
i 'm more scared of bird flu than football			0
' that 's handy : @entity317 ( left ) and @entity55 after @entity113 's visit to @entity186 on wednesday			0

@entity25 was a better version of me and his form was one of the main reasons i retired from international football
some outstanding central defenders have graced the @entity83 , such as @entity88 and @entity92 , but @entity25 is the pick of the bunch
@entity25 is @entity75 's best in his position , but he should n't travel to @entity359
@entity237 is lethal for @entity4 , but still unloved at his club
