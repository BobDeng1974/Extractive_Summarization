two volunteer paramedics ' seeking only to do good ' at the scene of accidents must be prosecuted for using sirens and flashing lights , the @entity0 has ordered - ' with regret '			1
judges upheld an appeal by the @entity9 against a refusal by @entity12 magistrates to convict @entity13 and @entity14 for using ' blues - and - twos '			1
the warning sirens and lights - used by police , paramedics and firefighters - helped the pair get to the scenes of accidents quicker than ambulances to give vital first aid			1
' blues - and - twos ' : the flashing blue light of a police car , like the ones used by @entity13 and @entity14 as they carried out their duties as medical volunteers for @entity34 's @entity33 service the judges agreed that their use by civilians was in breach of road traffic regulations , but suggested that there might be scope for @entity42 to change the rules			1
@entity44 , sitting with mr @entity45 in @entity46 , said she was ' saddened that medically trained citizens seeking only to do good , part of a scrupulously professional organisation with high standards and conspicuously shunning gratuitous publicity , find themselves effectively constrained in their efforts '			0
the initial prosecution came after @entity13 and @entity14 attended a accident involving a car and a motorcycle on the outskirts of @entity12 on october 14 , 2012			1
wearing high - visibility uniforms , they identified themselves to police as @entity62 personnel and were allowed to offer medical assistance in advance of an @entity66 ambulance arriving at 8.25pm			2
but officers told the two men they would be reported for using the blues - and - twos on their vehicles			0
district judge @entity71 was told at their trial that @entity33 originated in the @entity73 about 40 years ago with the overriding objective of preserving life , and has since spread to the @entity77			0
its aim is to provide emergency first - aid cover in defined areas , in this case @entity34 and parts of @entity12 , primarily but not exclusively for the @entity85 community			1
in @entity34 there are 20 @entity33 volunteers , 10 of whom are trained paramedics , including mr @entity13 and mr @entity14			1
their average response time to accidents is ' under two minutes ' , compared with seven to 10 minutes for @entity66 ambulances , the court heard			0
their vehicles - mr @entity13 's @entity94 and mr @entity14 's @entity96 saloon - carry medical equipment , including defibrillators , oxygen , and neck braces , as well as dressings , medications and some drugs			1
the @entity104 : mr @entity45 said current laws did not provide an exemption for ' first responder ' voluntary organisations like @entity33 to escape the restrictions on the use of blues - and - twos first founded in @entity112 , @entity113 , in the @entity114 , @entity33 is a volunteer emergency medical service which now has a presence in @entity85 communities throughout the world			1
as an organisation , it is the largest volunteer ambulance service in the world but , in effect , most groups work independently and are locally funded by donations from the @entity85 community			1
subscribers are given a special emergency number to call to put them through to a dispatcher , who then passes on the emergency message to the closest volunteer			2
@entity132 's organisational model provides for response times that are typically much faster than public emergency services			2
@entity132 is a @entity136 word meaning ' rescue ' or ' relief '			0
it is sometimes also known as @entity132 , which loosely translates as ' @entity141 '			0
judge @entity71 said @entity33 's 24 - hour - a - day work was funded by voluntary contributions from the @entity85 community and declared : ' i found @entity33 to be a responsible , dedicated and public - spirited organisation with well - trained and motivated operatives , of whom the defendants were two			1
' he acquitted both men of the blues - and - twos charge on the grounds that their vehicles were being ' used for ambulance purposes '			0
but now the @entity0 judges have ruled that he had got the law wrong and agreed ' with regret ' that the @entity9 's appeal must be allowed			2
mr @entity45 said road traffic legislation and the relevant regulations did not currently provide an exemption for ' first responder ' voluntary organisations like @entity33 to escape the restrictions on the use of blues - and - twos			2
he added : ' to be clear : widening the exemption to reflect the modern context is a task for the secretary of state and @entity42 , if so advised , and not for this court			0
' the judge suggested it would not be difficult for legislators ' to alight on a form of words ' to include @entity33 personnel within the exemption			0
lady justice @entity44 emphasised the ' importance or potential importance ' of the case and her own ' reluctance to allow this appeal '			0
agreeing with mr justice @entity45 's ruling , she said : ' like him , i am driven to the view that this appeal must be allowed			0
' like him , i am saddened that medically trained citizens seeking only to do good , part of a scrupulously professional organisation with high standards and conspicuously shunning gratuitous publicity , find themselves effectively constrained in their efforts			0

@entity196 had refused to convict @entity13 and @entity14 for using police - style flashing lights and sirens
the pair had been working as volunteers for @entity34 's @entity132 , a emergency medical service for the area 's @entity85 community
but the @entity0 rules that the law did not provide an exemption for ' first - responder ' type volunteer medical organistations
