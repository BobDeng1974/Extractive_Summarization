@entity1 's talisman batsman @entity0 , who has described team spirit on this desperate @entity4 tour as ‘ not that bad ’ , was nevertheless one of the squad who chose to miss the players ’ @entity9 lunch yesterday			1
it was the third time in a row on @entity4 trips that @entity0 has opted to have his festive meal away from the @entity1 team environment , spending it instead with more than 10 family members in @entity16			2
the players were under no three - line whip to attend and some , including @entity19 , preferred to go to the beach , while @entity21 also opted out to spend time with his family			0
keeping his ear to the ground : @entity0 has a word with the groundsmen at the @entity28 ahead of the fourth test the @entity1 function took place on the top floor of @entity16 ’s swish @entity33 with @entity35 and family among the 100 - strong turn - out despite the spin bowler ’s retirement from all cricket last sunday			2
@entity0 swerving the party comes after continued speculation that @entity35 — despite the subsequent denials — was aiming his ‘ up their own backsides ’ barbs at @entity0 in particular			2
and @entity0 said himself this week about how difficult it is building a team ’s unity when they keep losing			0
meanwhile , the @entity50 held their traditional @entity9 lunch at the @entity52 and captain @entity53 , who had been absent in 2006 and 2010 , attended this time			0
@entity9 lunch : @entity55 - one of @entity0 's loudest and most influential friends - tweeted a picture from his lunch in @entity16 @entity55 , keen village cricketer and @entity60 host , is in @entity16 and due to be a guest on @entity63 ’s @entity62			2
no doubt master publicist @entity55 will use that platform to promote his mate @entity0 at every opportunity and at the same time launch into @entity35 for quitting the tour with two tests still to be played			0
the fact @entity0 and @entity35 are not the best of buddies seems to be very relevant to all of @entity55 ’s many comments — particularly on @entity75 — on the manner of @entity35 ’s exit			0
it will be down to @entity80 chief executive @entity79 , who is at the @entity81 , to decide how much @entity35 will receive of his £ 500,000 - a - year central contract having quit three months into the deal			1
the likelihood is that @entity35 will get around £ 200,000 , plus the 30 - day notice period , which he did not give			1
team player : @entity0 's relationship with team - mates - and his attitude to batting - have once again been called into question in this series lawyers from all sides are set to get involved in the squabble over who should receive what for the aborted @entity4 video dairies following his retirement			1
happier times : @entity35 was always the character in the @entity1 dressing room , which is why his @entity4 diaries attracted a lucrative deal only one of the minimum four editions contracted with @entity1 backers @entity110 was released — and even that one followed doubts about the project after the abysmal start to the tour			2
the sponsors were due to pay £ 100,000 for endorsing @entity35 ’s diaries — such a success on the victorious @entity4 trip in 2010/11			1
but it is understood no money has yet been paid			0
@entity122 , who will be strong bidders in the upcoming tender for @entity126 ’s 50 - over @entity125 , @entity127 and @entity129 rights , are expected to head the queue to employ @entity35 , who is likely to have a number of broadcast options			1
but @entity35 , who has a habit of making rash comments which later need apologies or clarification — such as @entity1 being ‘ raped ’ in @entity138 or unnamed players being ‘ up their own backsides ’ — is going to need a significant amount of media training before being trusted to go live on air			0
spin doctor : @entity35 's outspoken views and loose tongue could make him a must - watch pundit for @entity122 or @entity148 however , @entity148 boss @entity149 , who is on holiday in @entity16 and @entity151 for the cricket , showed no great immediate interest in adding @entity35 to his already over-populated pundits team			1
but @entity149 , wounded by @entity122 ’s capture of @entity157 football , will certainly be using his time @entity159 to shore up his close links with the @entity80 and @entity161 — both of whom have long - term @entity148 deals			1
only @entity164 , who was relaxing in @entity138 while @entity35 was announcing his shock retirement in @entity16 , could highlight the @entity63 cricket correspondent not being around for such a big story by tweeting : ‘ @entity168 , @entity169 ’ – a reference to @entity171 which he had flown a light plane over that same day			0
catching @entity173 : captain @entity174 practises at slip as @entity1 look to save face on this dreadful @entity4 tour however , at least the brand @entity180 — @entity164 and wife @entity181 — were early at the @entity28 yesterday for an @entity173 interview .			0
