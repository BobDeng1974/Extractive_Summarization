‘ it ’s hard enough winning it in the first place but going back - to - back has always been that bit more difficult			1
‘ on the basis of a lot of the conversations i ’ve had with sir @entity44 ( @entity44 ) over the years in terms of the motivation of the squad , the hardest part of the job is the season after , to try and do back - to - back victories in a very difficult league			1
