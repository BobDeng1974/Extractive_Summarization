@entity1 's partner was told that she had died suddenly - only to discover she was still alive the family of a cancer patient was told in a phone call by hospital staff she had died suddenly – only to discover she was still alive after rushing to her bedside			1
astonishingly , @entity1 ’s partner realised she was still breathing when he held her hand to say a final goodbye			1
‘ she was still warm and i could feel she was pulsing , ’ said @entity9			2
‘ i said to the nurses : “ she ’s still alive ! ” and they said : “ she ’s not , it ’s this involuntary reaction ”			1
’ after eventually realising their mistake , nurses summoned a doctor but mr @entity9 claims they waited more than an hour for her to arrive			1
in a further twist , it is now feared leukaemia patient ms @entity1 , 71 , may have suffered brain damage during the episode			1
last night , she remained critically ill. ‘ i can not believe the course of events , ’ said mr @entity9 , a photographer			2
‘ they ’re professionals – they ’re supposed to know what they ’re doing			0
’ the blunder at @entity27 , @entity28 , is the latest in a series of scandals to hit the @entity31 in recent months			0
in november , @entity32 unearthed a catalogue of hospital mortuary mix - ups in which dead bodies were abandoned for days			0
ms @entity1 , from @entity36 , @entity28 , was diagnosed with leukaemia in december and initially had a ten - day course of chemotherapy			1
on february 21 , she rang mr @entity9 , her partner of more than 30 years , to say doctors had told her she would be home in five days			1
‘ she was doing brilliantly and there were no problems , ’ he said.but at 5.30 the following morning , he was called by a nurse			0
‘ she said @entity1 had been found slumped over the bed			2
she said she was not breathing , there was no pulse , and there were no signs of life			2
that ’s what the nurse said – verbatim			0
then she said , “ do n’t jump in your car and rush down here , because there ’s nothing we can do			0
” ’ he was told a resuscitation team had worked on ms @entity1 for half an hour before stopping			1
after putting the phone down , mr @entity9 called @entity1 ’s family to break the news , including her brother @entity62			1
@entity63 , 64 , added : ‘ i phoned the hospital and asked if it was ok to come up			0
but the nurse said : “ i ’m sorry love , she just passed away a few minutes ago			0
” @entity9 says when he arrived at the hospital : ‘ i told the nurses , “ i want to say goodbye to her			1
” the nurses showed me in and said , “ ignore the fact she looks as if she is breathing , it ’s an involuntary reaction			1
she is dead ; there ’s nothing we can do			0
” ‘ i got hold of her hand and i knew straight away that she was still alive			2
’ when mr @entity9 swore at the nurses , saying it was clear she was alive , he was told he was being ‘ emotional ’			1
but he responded : ‘ she is still alive			2
i want you to do something , and i want you to do it now ! ’ finally , a nurse checked and found a pulse			0
mr @entity9 is ms @entity1 's partner of more than 30 years mr @entity9 claimed : ‘ then they tried to tell me she was dead and she had come back to life			1
but i ’m absolutely positive that they were wrong , and that she was alive all along			2
’ he continued : ‘ she did not look dead at all to me			0
she looked like she was suffering			0
her breath was staccato , she was n’t breathing easily , she was laid out on her back gasping for life			0
if i had not been there , i am sure she would have died			0
‘ i told one of the doctors : “ you were going to take her down to the morgue and put her in the fridge , were n’t you ? ” ’ mr @entity9 claimed from the time he told nurses she was still alive , at about 6.30am , it took an hour for them to summon a registrar			1
‘ she confirmed @entity1 was still alive , ’ he said			2
mr @entity9 said he had ‘ no idea why it took so long ’ to raise a doctor , adding : ‘ nobody ’s telling me anything			2
they keep saying : “ we are really sorry that this has happened			0
” but nobody will actually say why it happened , or even what happened			0
’ mr @entity9 , 58 , said he wanted an external investigation as he did not trust the hospital to launch its own inquiry			2
ms @entity1 , who has two teenaged grandchildren , is currently unresponsive , said her partner , but her eyes are open			1
‘ she has no reaction when people walk into the room , ’ he said			0
error : nurses at @entity27 , @entity28 , eventually realised their mistake and summoned a doctor ms @entity1 was diagnosed with leukaemia in december and initially had a ten - day course of chemotherapy after the incident , doctors told him they did not believe she would last more than 72 hours – but that was two weeks ago			1
mr @entity9 said he was told the resuscitation team had worked on her for about half an hour prior to the nurse calling him			1
‘ they said her brain was starved of oxygen for so long , that she would be brain damaged			0
’ he thought the staff ’s belief she was dead may have meant she suffered additional brain damage – a claim the hospital trust declined to comment on last night			1
@entity148 said it was investigating			0
dr @entity149 , clinical director , said : ‘ we acknowledge this is a very troubling time for ms @entity1 ’s family and can fully understand why they are finding it difficult to deal with this tragic turn of events			1
‘ our clinical team , including our matron and consultants , are reviewing ms @entity1 and meeting with the family on a regular basis			1
this is a very complex and unusual circumstance and we have set up an investigation to look at the detail of the situation			0
‘ in the meantime we will continue to do our best to support the family and to provide answers as and when they become available			0

@entity1 's partner , @entity9 , realised she was still breathing when he held her hand to say a final goodbye
told nurses she was still alive but they said it was ' an involuntary reaction '
