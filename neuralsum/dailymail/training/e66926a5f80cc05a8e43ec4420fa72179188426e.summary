it is a stunning family portrait of the @entity1 and its moon			2
@entity4 's experimental spacecraft , currently flying around the moon before returning to @entity1 on saturday , has captured these incredible images			1
the eight - day mission is seen as a test - run for the country 's first unmanned return trip to the lunar surface , which will take place in 2017			1
the mission is intended to be a precursor to a mission to the lunar surface in 2017 the module will be 257,000 miles ( 413,000 km ) from @entity1 at its furthest point on the eight - day mission			1
the official @entity22 news agency said it would re-enter the atmosphere at 11.2 kilometres per second ( 25,000 mph ) before slowing down - a process that generates extremely high temperatures - and it will land in northern @entity4 's @entity27 region			0
it will return to @entity1 using a @entity29 - designed method in which it will first bounce off @entity1 's atmosphere in order to slow it down to allow it to enter the atmosphere without burning up			0
and if @entity4 successfully manages to bring samples back from the moon , they will be only the third nation to carry out such a mission after the @entity39 and @entity40			1
the spacecraft lifted off from the southwestern @entity43 satellite launch centre early this morning			1
it separated from its carrier rocket and entered @entity1 orbit shortly after , the @entity44 ( @entity45 ) reported , according to the official @entity22			0
' the first stage of the first return journey test in @entity4 's moon probe programme has been successful , ' @entity48 said after the launch , from the @entity43 space base in the southwestern province of @entity55			1
the module will be 257,000 miles ( 413,000 km ) from @entity1 at its furthest point on the eight - day mission			1
the official @entity22 news agency said it would re-enter the atmosphere at 11.2 kilometres per second ( 25,000 mph ) before slowing down - a process that generates extremely high temperatures - and it will land in northern @entity4 's @entity27 region			0
@entity4 's lunar exploration program , named @entity64 after a mythical goddess , has already launched a pair of orbiting lunar probes and last year landed a craft on the moon with a rover onboard			0
@entity4 has also hinted at a possible crewed mission to the moon at a future date if officials decide to combine the human spaceflight and lunar exploration programs			2
the craft also captured this amazing ' blue marble ' image showing the @entity1 an image of the lunar surface captured as the craft passed by @entity22 said the latest mission is to ' obtain experimental data and validate re-entry technologies such as guidance , navigation and control , heat shield and trajectory design ' for the future moonlander christened @entity64			1
it will return to @entity1 using a @entity29 - designed method in which it will first bounce off @entity1 's atmosphere in order to slow it down to allow it to enter the atmosphere without burning up			0
@entity4 's military - backed space program is a source of massive national pride , especially its series of successful manned missions that have placed up to three astronauts at a time in an experimental orbiting space station called @entity101 1			0
the @entity103 rocket carrying an experimental moon orbiter launches from the @entity105 in southwest @entity4 's @entity55 province , 24 october 2014			0
the spacecraft will fly around the moon and back to @entity1 as @entity4 's first return - trip of lunar orbiter			1
it sent its first astronaut into space in 2003 , becoming the third nation after @entity40 and the @entity39 to achieve manned space travel independently			2
@entity4 has powered ahead in a series of methodically timed steps , independent of the @entity39 programme , which is now in its sixth decade of putting people into space and has long - term plans to go to an asteroid and @entity122			2
alongside the manned program , @entity4 is developing the long march 5 heavy - lift rocket needed to launch a more permanent space station to be called @entity126			0
@entity4 's space programme has been picking up speed over the last decade			0
they have already sent a handful of astronauts into @entity1 orbit including @entity133 , left , @entity134 , right , and @entity135 pictured here in june 2012 on their way to the launch pad last year @entity4 successfully landed and operated a rover on the moon called @entity141 , shown			2
however , it ultimately succumbed to the bitterly cold lunar nights			0
@entity4 's next mission to the lunar surface in 2017 will lift return samples to @entity1			1

@entity4 sent mission to the moon from the southwestern @entity43 satellite launch centre
spacecraft is flying around the moon on an eight - day mission
it is intended to be a precursor to a mission to the lunar surface in 2017
this will return samples back to @entity1 - only the third nation to do so after the @entity39 and @entity40
@entity4 also has plans to land people on the moon , possibly beyond 2020
