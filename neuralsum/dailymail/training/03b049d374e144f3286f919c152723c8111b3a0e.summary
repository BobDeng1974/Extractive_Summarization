by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 06:07 est , 5 january 2014 updated : 12:08 est , 5 january 2014 prime minister @entity3 , pictured arriving at @entity4 for the @entity5 , says he will cease benefits to 40,000 children who live in other @entity9 countries millions of pounds in child benefit paid to families living outside the @entity12 will be axed under @entity3 ’s plan to claw back powers from @entity15			1
the prime minister insisted it was wrong that the @entity12 taxpayer is giving cash to 40,000 children who live elsewhere in the @entity9			1
he revealed stopping migrant workers in the @entity12 from claiming child benefit for their offspring back home would be a key demand of his plans to renegotiate a fresh deal with the @entity9 before staging an in - out referendum by 2017			1
under @entity9 rules , the benefit has to be paid to @entity31 nationals who are working in @entity12 and paying national insurance – even if their families are based abroad			1
here are around 24,000 families claiming for 40,000 children , with two - thirds of the children based in @entity37			2
mr @entity3 said : ‘ i do n’t think that is right and that is something i want to change			2
’ he warned stopping the export of benefits across the @entity9 would ‘ take time ’ because a deal would need to be struck with other member states or wait for the new treaty he hopes to negotiate if he is still prime minister after the next election			1
he told @entity50 ’s @entity5 show : ‘ there are other @entity31 countries who like me think it ’s wrong that someone from @entity37 who comes here , who works hard - and i am absolutely all in favour of that - but i do n’t think we should be paying child benefit to their family back at home in @entity37			1
‘ now , to change that , you ’ve either got to change it with other @entity31 countries at the moment , or potentially change it through the treaty change that i ’ll be putting in place before the referendum we will hold on @entity12 ’s membership of the @entity9 by the end of 2017			1
’ child benefit is paid at £ 20.30 a week for the first child and £ 13.40 for every other child			1
since last year families in the @entity12 with one person earning more than £ 50,000 have had their child benefit cut , and removed altogether if one earner has a salary of more than £ 60,000			1
mr @entity3 made clear that tackling immigration from @entity31 would also be a key demand of renegotiation talks			0
all those steps we ’ll be taking			0
’ he said he wanted to change @entity12 ’s relationship with the @entity9 before putting it to a vote in an in - out referendum			2
' there are other @entity31 countries who like me think it ’s wrong that someone from @entity37 who comes here , who works hard - and i am absolutely all in favour of that - but i do n’t think we should be paying child benefit to their family back at home in @entity37 ' - pm @entity3 he refused to say if he would campaign to leave the @entity9 if he failed to secure enough concessions , insisting his renegotiation was ‘ doable ’			1
‘ we need flexibility , we need more competitiveness , we need less costs added to our small business , we need to fix all these things			0
’ but the pm came under fresh pressure to explain why he had not published a forecast for the number of @entity139 and @entity140 who will arrive this year after work restrictions were lifted			0
‘ we are not making a forecast because i think it is unlikely we would get that forecast right , ’ the prime minister said			2
but he defended moves to charge foreign nationals to use @entity150 departments on the @entity151 , denying it was to bureaucratic to be enforced			0
he said : ‘ we should do it			0
our @entity151 is a national treasure , we can all be incredibly proud of it and it ’s right that we all pay into it and everyone here has access to it for free			0
‘ but people who come to our country , who do n’t have the right to use it , should be charged for it , and we ’re putting that in place			0
’ passengers by a bus departing for western @entity31 at the central bus station in @entity171 , @entity140 a few days ago			0
mr @entity3 made clear that tackling immigration from @entity31 would also be a key demand of renegotiation talks mr @entity3 's tough stance on @entity9 immigration is seen as a response to the growing popularity of the @entity12 @entity179 , which predicts it will win elections to the @entity181 in may			2
@entity179 leader @entity182 dismissed the prime minister 's announcements as rhetoric designed to echo his own policies			2
he wrote on @entity187 : @entity3 seems to be trying to sound like me			0
but the thing is , i believe in what i say			0

prime minister says it is wrong workers in @entity12 can send benefits home
two thirds of all child benefit sent abroad goes to @entity37
deal would need to be struck with other @entity9 countries or secure new treaty
