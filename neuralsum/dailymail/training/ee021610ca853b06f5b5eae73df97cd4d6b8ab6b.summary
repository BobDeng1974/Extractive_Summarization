when i saw the photo of @entity2 in bondage gear and a cardigan , baring her breasts for a magazine , i felt an overwhelming urge : to do up her buttons			1
i ’m no prude — how could i be , when i first modelled topless myself at 16 ? — but it made me uncomfortable			1
to me , these shots are less daring than they are desperate			1
@entity2 is a gutsy , smart woman who i admire , but she does n’t need these kind of pictures			1
we ’ve seen her promote this look before — about 20 years ago			1
it ’s time she moved on			1
at 61 , i ’m five years older than her and i ’m certainly not saying an older woman ca n’t have sexy photos taken			1
but i feel i should let her in on a secret — it ’s no longer as simple as taking your clothes off			1
at our age , it often has more to do with what you keep on			2
when @entity30 saw the photo of @entity2 in bondage gear and a cardigan , baring her breasts for a magazine , she felt an overwhelming urge : to do up her buttons so @entity2 , in the interests of sisterhood , here are my tips for stripping off in style			1
@entity43 @entity44 , £ 27.50 , and knickers , £ 12.50 , @entity46 for autograph , marksandspencer.com the first rule about stripping off over 50 is to keep movement to a minimum			1
mature flesh does n’t travel well : if you turn round too fast your bottom arrives a few seconds after the rest of you — the antithesis of sexiness			2
fortunately , well - chosen lingerie that is sturdy , yet sexy , can work age - defying miracles , hold in wobbly bits and counteract the effects of gravity			1
this bra , for instance , boosts my bust , but does n’t show too much flesh , so it solves the problem of crepey cleavage			2
the wide strap at the back gives good support and flattens back fat			2
the pants have a tummy - slimming panel at the front and come up high enough to hide some of my jelly belly , which is the bit of myself i feel least confident about			2
do n't pine for the past @entity80 body , £ 71 , @entity81 : 020 7629 9161 @entity2 has always been the @entity2 , but now she seems to be stuck in the past			1
the trouble with harking back to your heyday is that it simply invites unflattering comparisons between your appearance now and what you looked like before			2
you need to move on and create a new image for yourself			2
i experienced this first - hand , modelling for @entity92 in the @entity93 and then again aged 58			2
the first time round , it did n’t occur to me to be self - conscious , even though the underwear left little to the imagination and i was in the window of their @entity99 store			0
three decades later , i needed all the structure and cover i could get , yet still felt insecure about the results			0
in this shot , i ’m wearing a lacy body but , instead of revealing what ’s underneath , it ’s just suggested by the nude material			0
even so , i ca n’t say i like this photograph			0
i am at least a stone heavier than in my heyday , and it just reminds me of what i ’ve lost			0
however , it ’s important that i try to remind myself of everything i ’ve gained in life			0
that was then and this is now — live in the present			0
't is the season to be jolly i like this pose a lot			0
it looks daring — but , actually , you do n’t see a thing			1
and , most importantly , it puts a smile on your face			0
if you ’re posing for a slightly risqué shot , it ’s much better to have fun with it than to look as if you ’re taking yourself too seriously			0
if you can laugh at yourself when you ’re in this slightly vulnerable situation , it will come across as innocent fun , not sleazy or attention - grabbing			0
much better to position yourself as one of the @entity136 , your modesty hidden by a strategically - placed plate of buns ( or @entity141 wreath in my case ) , than as underdressed mutton hoping to pass as spring lamb			0
yes , people will laugh — but with you , rather than at you			0
a couple of years ago , rather stuck for a @entity141 present for my husband , i simply wrapped myself from head to foot in yards of satin ribbon			1
however , unable to hold the pose , i fell flat on my gift - wrapped derriere			0
after he stopped laughing , he said it was the best present he ’d ever had .			0
