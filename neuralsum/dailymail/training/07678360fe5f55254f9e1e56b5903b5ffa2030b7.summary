the killer was recaptured by @entity11 after failing to return to jail on saturday afternoon			2
@entity13 , a violent thief and fellow inmate with @entity16 tattoos who was also on temporary licence , also absconded on the same day from the same prison			1
last night @entity13 was arrested and being held in custody			1
back in custody : @entity5 ( left ) , a convicted murderer , was found today , hours after robber @entity13 ( right ) was also been recaptured in @entity22 their escape comes a fortnight after @entity26 absconded from an open prison and allegedly robbed a building society before being caught four days later			1
justice secretary @entity29 this morning promised to ' tear up ' the current day release programme and suggested prisoners who had a history of escaping would no longer be allowed out			1
it came after mps attacked the ' absolute scandal ' of murderers being allowed out of prison ' willy nilly '			0
in 1991 , a judge said @entity5 appointed himself as an ‘ executioner ’ when he decided to kill 53 - year - old @entity41 , who was wrongly thought to be a paedophile			2
he was serving 18 years for that murder when he went missing on saturday			2
his three previous escapes have been from @entity45 in @entity46 and open prisons in @entity48 and @entity49			1
@entity5 , 44 , and @entity13 , 51 , had been allowed out from @entity50 – an open category c prison in @entity52 , @entity53 – at 9.30am on saturday			1

he was caught after an employee slipped an explosive dye pack into a bundle of cash			0
crime : the men failed to return to prison after leaving @entity50 , in @entity52 , at around 9.30am on saturday morning the day release programme is designed to help prisoners settle back into ordinary life towards the end of their sentence by allowing them to attend work or training			1
but it has come under fierce attack for leaving the public at risk from unreformed , dangeours criminals			0
the government has admitted that more than 1,600 murderers , druglords and other hardened criminals were granted day release last year			1
last july , @entity88 ( pictured above ) was convicted of murdering @entity89 in the village of @entity91 , @entity92 , while on day release			1
murderer @entity93 carried out 11 armed raids on bookmakers after being handed a release pass in 2010			2
and @entity97 , a drug dealer , spent his day out of prison in 2008 overseeing a £ 14million cocaine deal			2
last week it was revealed more than 400 killers were kept in open prisons , which have minimal supervision			0
justice secretary @entity29 this morning added : ' i 'm not happy with the way things are at the moment			1
' although the number of people absconding is tiny , we 've seen in the last few months a number of serious offences committed by people on temporary licence			1
but we are tearing up the system as it exist at moment			2
' mr @entity29 said he would ban prisoners being allowed to walk around town @entity118 said : ' town - leavers will only be allowed out on temporary licence to do something tangible like a day 's work			1
' serious offenders will be subject to a much stricter risk assessment			0
and i ca n't see why we allow back into open conditions people who have absconded before , so i 'm looking at moving reforms in that area quickly			2
' people who have absconded can not go back to open conditions			0
these changes will happen within next few weeks			0
' but prison officers said overcrowding and job cuts were to blame for the escapes			0
@entity138 , chairman of the @entity139 , said : ' we have been saying for many years now that we have overcrowding in the prison estate , people are being put into open conditions who are unsuitable for open conditions			0
' twenty prisons have closed in the last three years and prison staff numbers have reduced by 6,000 since 2010			0
" there is immense pressure on the system and it is clear to me that the tick box mentality that goes into transferring prisoners to open conditions has failed the public			0
@entity154 mp @entity153 added : ‘ convicted murderers should not be released on temporary licence , it ’s common sense , the public are being put at unnecessary risk			1
the idea that there is a robust risk assessment in place is for the birds , the system is in complete shambles			0
‘ if it was n’t so serious it would be funny , but these are dangerous people who the public deserve to be protected against			0
’ armed robber @entity172 , @entity173 the @entity174 , went on the run for four days after absconding from open prison he said the disappearances were an ' absolute scandal ' and questioned why convicted murderers were ever given temporary release when figures which he obtained through parliamentary answers showed 106 had absconded in the past 10 years			1
a spokesman for @entity53 police said both @entity5 and @entity13 had been ‘ risk assessed ’ as suitable for release , but warned the public not to approach them and to call officers instead			1
@entity5 was jailed for life with a minimum of 18 years for stabbing mr @entity41 to death in @entity9			1
but he absconded while in the exercise yard of @entity45 and later went on the run from @entity196 open prison in @entity48 after being let out to empty bins in @entity198			2
@entity199 issued this mugshot of ' @entity174 ' @entity172 , after he went missing while temporarily being allowed out of prison earlier this month he disappeared from @entity203 open prison in @entity49 in 2006 and spent nine days on the run before being caught in a flat in @entity206			0
a third prisoner who absconded from @entity50 two months ago remains on the loose			0
@entity208 , 36 , disappeared on march 23 and police say the robber poses a risk to some former contacts			2
an urgent review is currently taking place into why @entity26 was allowed temporary day release earlier this month			1
despite going on the run twice beforehand , the robber was allowed to walk out of @entity219 open prison in @entity199 where he was serving 13 life sentences			0
he was eventually caught in @entity222 on may 7 after spending almost four days on the run and has since been charged with robbing the @entity224 , in @entity225 , @entity226 , at gunpoint			0
last year , @entity228 chief inspector of prisons @entity229 said @entity50 had ‘ needlessly restrictive ’ security for an open prison			0
