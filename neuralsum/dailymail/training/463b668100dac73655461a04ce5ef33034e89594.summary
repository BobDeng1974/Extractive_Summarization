they were joined by @entity77 ( @entity78 ) and @entity80 ( @entity81 )			2
the supporting actress category was led by @entity101 ( @entity59 ) , @entity102 ( @entity61 ) , @entity103 ( birdman ) , awards season favourite @entity104 ( @entity105 ) , and @entity106 ( @entity107 )			1
while in the male category for supporting actor the list was topped by veteran @entity91 ( @entity92 ) , @entity93 ( @entity59 ) , @entity7 winner @entity94 ( birdman ) , @entity95 ( @entity78 ) , and @entity96 ( @entity97 ) and the nominees are : the @entity12 were announced by @entity195 and @entity196 in @entity26 on wednesday early birds : the duo announced the nominations in the wee hours of wednesday morning handsome presenters : @entity196 and @entity195 posed for a photo after their announcements and the nominees , as to be expected , were thrilled by the honour , with @entity102 tweeting : ' thank you so much to the @entity12			1
it 's such an honor to be nominated by your peers and in the company of this group of talented women			0
i 'm thrilled to celebrate this morning with @entity79 [ @entity79 ] and the cast			2
' and @entity82 was keen on thanking his director upon hearing the news : ' as an actor being nominated by actors for playing an actor , i am truly , truly grateful for this honor			2
an ensemble like this hardly ever comes around , and all of us made this very unique film work - lead by our maestro , director @entity224			2
' while @entity80 gave a shout out to his big sister : ' i am even more happy for my sister who i think is extraordinary in the honorable woman and it would seem that @entity12 thinks so too			2
my sister 's a bada * *			0
' double threat : @entity82 and @entity94 are both nominated in the leading and supporting categories , respectively , for birdman first timer : @entity83 is up for leading actor for @entity17 but for @entity93 it had even greater significance : ' i 've been acting for 30 years now			1
so the @entity12 nomination is genuinely meaningful to me			0
particularly this year , with the loss of @entity243 and @entity140 , our acting community is more important to me than ever			0
' the awards were announced on wednesday by @entity245 star @entity195 and @entity196 of @entity246			0
the @entity12 will air next year on january 25 , with the @entity7 airing nearly a month later on february 22			0
veteran : @entity93 is nominated for best supporting actor for his work in boyhood many of last year 's @entity12 winners went on to claim @entity7 gold , including @entity128 ( @entity254 ) , @entity255 ( @entity256 ) , @entity257 ( 12 years a slave ) , and @entity259 ( @entity254 )			1
nearly every major acting nod handed out at the @entity12 awards was a precursor for the @entity7 in 2014 - making it one of the best predictors for how this year 's race will go			0
the only category that did not match up was @entity12 's ensemble award which has no equivalent in the @entity7			0
@entity12 nominees are voted in by their peers with 4,200 members of the guild randomly selected each year to nominate their favourites			0
creepy turn earns him some accolades : @entity80 is nominated in the leading actor category for @entity81 back in the game : @entity101 is up for supporting actress for her role in boyhood the voters are split in half , with 2,100 weighing in on television performances and the other 2,100 deciding who will be honoured for outstanding performances in film			1
following the polling process the full body of both @entity12 and @entity288 ( @entity290 's acting unions ) then decides upon the winners in each category			0
among the big awards ceremonies , @entity12 is the first to announce their nominees , resulting in some major films not being included			0
last year @entity297 failed to send in their screeners on time for the selection process thereby excluding it from the awards ceremony			0
stellar : @entity79 is another actor in the leading category for @entity61 the year before @entity305 ran into a similar problem and this year it is @entity308 ( a civil rights drama starring @entity310 , @entity311 , and @entity312 )			1
much like all of the major awards shows the categories honour actors for leading roles , supporting roles and ensembles ( differing from the @entity7 , which only celebrates solo performances )			2
however , @entity12 is strictly a ceremony celebrating actors and actresses and does not recognize producers or directors			0
a dramatic turn : @entity77 is nominated in the leading actor category for @entity78 seasoned : @entity91 , a previous winner of a @entity12 award , is up for best supporting actor for @entity92			1

@entity79 , @entity80 , and @entity82 up for @entity332 in film role
birdman , @entity61 , and @entity17 will *battle* it out for @entity337
@entity6 and @entity4 are up against @entity18 and @entity20 in the stacked leading actress category
the @entity342 category sees @entity93 , @entity94 , and @entity95 go head - to - head
@entity102 , @entity103 , @entity104 , and @entity106 up for best supporting actress
in the tv category @entity123 garnered four nods , while @entity68 and @entity117 *picked* up three apiece
best pals @entity128 and @entity127 face - off in the @entity332 category for true detective
@entity180 and @entity95 both nominated for their roles in @entity169
