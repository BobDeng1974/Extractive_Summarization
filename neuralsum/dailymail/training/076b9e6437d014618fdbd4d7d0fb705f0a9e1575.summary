by @entity0 published : 17:14 est , 6 february 2014 @entity2 : 18:13 est , 6 february 2014 @entity4 's curiosity rover has been looking back at its home planet - and even send a picture back			1
the amazing image reveals the @entity8 and the moon in the far distance			0
it was taken as controllers prepare to send to rover on a risky mission to climb a large sand dune			2
can you spot home ? this view of the twilight sky and @entity21 horizon taken by @entity4 's @entity22 includes @entity8 as the brightest point of light in the night sky			1
researchers used the left eye camera of @entity22 's @entity28 ( @entity29 ) to capture this scene about 80 minutes after sunset on the 529th @entity21 day , or sol , of the rover 's work on @entity21 on jan. 31			1

@entity8 is a little left of center in the image , and our moon is just below @entity8			0

' a human observer with normal vision , if standing on @entity21 , could easily see @entity8 and the moon as two distinct , bright ' evening stars , ' the space agency said			2

however , curiosity is not the first rover to photograph home from the red planet			0
that honour goes to the @entity59 one hour before sunrise on the 63rd martian day , or sol , of its mission			0
the image is a mosaic of images taken by the rover 's navigation camera showing a broad view of the sky , and an image taken by the rover 's panoramic camera of @entity8			2
the contrast in the panoramic camera image was increased two times to make @entity8 easier to see			0
this is the first image ever taken of @entity8 from the surface of a planet beyond the @entity79 , taken by the @entity59 ion 2004 mission controllers were today set to give its @entity22 its toughest assignment yet - attempting to drive over a 1m high dune			1
mission controllers say the route , despite the dune , is far safer			0
they were concerned their planned route was filled with sharp rocks that could damage the rover 's wheels			2
will it make it ? @entity4 's @entity22 is set to drive west and attempt to climb the 1m high dune in the foreground of this picture			1
curiosity is on a southwestward traverse of many months from an area where it found evidence of ancient conditions favorable for microbial life to its long - term science destination on the lower slopes of @entity107			0
based on analysis of images taken from orbit by @entity4 's @entity111 , a location dubbed ' @entity113 ' was assessed as a possible gateway to a favorable route for the next portion of the traverse			1
a final decision on whether to pass through this valley will ride on evaluation of a short drive planned this week toward the top of the dune that lies across ' @entity113			2
' ' the decision has n't been made yet , but it is prudent to go check , ' said @entity126 of @entity4 's @entity127 , @entity128 , @entity129 , project manager for @entity22			1
recent close - up pictures reveal multiple punctures , rips and dimples in @entity22 's metal ' tyres '			0
' we 'll take a peek over the dune into the valley immediately to the west to see whether the terrain looks as good as the analysis of orbital images implies			0
' the dune is about 3 feet ( 1 meter ) high at its center , tapered off at both sides of the gap between two low scarps			0
recent close - up pictures reveal multiple punctures , rips and dimples in @entity22 's metal ' tyres '			0
the track pattern â € ” dot - dash - dash - dash , dot - dash - dash - dot , dot - dash - dot - dot ( '			0
. ' ) â € ” spells out ' @entity127 ' in @entity154 , which translates letters and numbers into a series of short ( " dot ' ) and long ( ' dash ' ) signals			0
another image revealing the dune @entity22 is attempting to climb ' we have intentionally put holes in the wheels to leave a unique track on @entity21 , ' @entity4 said			1
' so if we are in sand dunes where we do n't have lots of rock features around us , we can use those patterns to do our visual odometry			0
' the agency is taking no chances after @entity4 's spirit rover was lost in a sand trap in 2009 a color view assembled from images taken by @entity22 's @entity28 ( @entity29 ) on the east side of the dune shows details of the valley that the rover may traverse this month			1
this mosaic of images from the @entity185 ( @entity186 ) on @entity4 's @entity22 shows the terrain to the west from the rover 's position on the 528th @entity21 day , or sol , of the mission ( jan. 30 , 2014 )			1
@entity4 's @entity193 is using @entity22 to assess ancient habitable environments and major changes in @entity21 environmental conditions			1
@entity127 , a division of the @entity197 in @entity128 , built the rover and manages the project for @entity4 's @entity200 in @entity201 .			1

dune is 1m high , and located in ' @entity113 ' on the @entity21 surface
team will slowly drive the rover to try and stop it getting stuck
