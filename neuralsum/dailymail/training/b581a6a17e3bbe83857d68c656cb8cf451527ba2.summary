’ @entity7 , who was officially diagnosed with narcolepsy and catalepsy in december last year , added : ‘ it can happen at any time			1
‘ like standing up or sitting down			0
i 've really been lucky that i 've not hurt myself falling asleep while standing up and i ask myself everyday how i 've managed			2
‘ at school i 'll be sitting at my desk and this wave of tiredness takes over			2
then you 're eyes start to roll and droop and that 's when you know what 's about to happen			0
@entity7 ( pictured before her illness ) said : ' what hurts the most is when people see me in public and i 'm starting to fall asleep and they look at me as if i 'm drunk or have been taking drugs ' ‘ it ’s like a rollercoaster of emotions sometimes and at first it was really embarrassing			1

even the teachers joined in at first			0
i 've been reduced to tears so many times			0

narcolepsy , which occurs in one in every 2,000 people , is a sleep disorder that causes a person to suddenly fall asleep at inappropriate times			2
it is a long - term neurological condition that disrupts normal sleeping patterns			0
symptoms include , sleep attacks , daytime sleepiness and cataplexy - temporary muscle weakness in response to emotion			0
it is often caused by an autoimmune response - this is when antibodies are released by the body but instead of destroying disease , they attack healthy cells			0
in the case of narcolepsy , antibodies attack the areas of the brain that produce a sleep - regulating chemical			2
there is currently no cure but the condition can sometimes be managed , for example , by taking regular naps , eating healthily and exercising			0
in some cases , medications such as antidepressants or stimulants can also help			0
it is thought that for every 55,000 children who were given the jab , @entity11 , one has developed narcolepsy			1
researchers , who published their findings in the @entity215 , studied 75 children with narcolepsy and found that 11 of these had received the vaccine before their symptoms began			2
the vaccine is associated with a 14-fold increase in a child 's risk of developing the condition			0

a spokesman for the @entity267 confirmed they had written to four families previously rejected for compensation inviting them to reapply			0
saying individual cases could not be discussed , he added : ‘ @entity272 provides support in the very rare cases where someone becomes severely disabled as a result of a vaccination			0
‘ decisions on vaccine damage payments claims take into account the individual circumstances of each case and the latest available accepted medical evidence			0
‘ @entity267 has looked at some vaccine damage payments cases again in light of new information regarding swine flu and narcolepsy provided by the @entity289			0
‘ once this new information was taken into account it was decided , on balance of probability , in some cases that causation was proved			0
