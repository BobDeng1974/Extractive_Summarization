by @entity0 published : 19:32 est , 15 august 2013 updated : 19:32 est , 15 august 2013 mps last night condemned a ruling that allows a convicted terrorist to continue walking the streets of @entity5 12 years after he first arrived here			1
ministers are powerless to expel the 50 - year - old @entity7 , known only as @entity8 , even though he was refused asylum on the grounds that , as a terrorist , he can not claim refugee status			1
he can not be booted out of the @entity5 because his ‘ life and liberty ’ are judged to be in jeopardy if he returns to his home country , where he was convicted in 1993 of complicity in the bombing of @entity18 , which killed nine people			1
blast : the man 's ' life and liberty ' are judged to be in jeopardy if he returns to his home country , where he was convicted in 1993 of complicity in the bombing of @entity18 ( file picture ) , which killed nine people he was also imprisoned in @entity28 for two years for his involvement in a terrorist group			1
@entity28 simply expelled him as an ‘ undesirable ’ , after which he fled to the @entity5 – where he remains because the @entity5 system has not managed to do the same			0
@entity34 backbencher @entity33 ridiculed the idea that a terrorist could secure refuge with the argument that his life is at risk if he is sent home			1
he said : ‘ if you dedicate your career to blowing people up , your life may well be at risk – but that ’s an occupational hazard of being a terrorist ; it ’s not our problem			1
’ mr @entity33 added : ‘ it ’s not just ah who should be in the dock , it is the immigration tribunal system which prevents us from removing a convicted killer			1
‘ until we have democratic accountability over immigration tribunals , we can have no confidence in them			0
why should our country be a haven for @entity7 terrorists ? what part of “ get out ” does the immigration system not understand ? ‘ our country is signed up to the same idiotic human rights as @entity28 , but somehow @entity28 manages to stand up to the security of their country better than we do			1
yet again , we seem to be the mugs in all of this			0
’ the legal battle has cost @entity5 taxpayers hundreds of thousands of pounds , and all the while it is believed ah has been living on benefits			2
the @entity76 judges rejected his latest appeal last month , but @entity8 is challenging their ruling in the @entity80			0
' get out ' : @entity34 backbencher @entity33 ridiculed the idea that a terrorist could secure refuge with the argument that his life is at risk if he is sent home now the @entity88 is hoping to get a bilateral deal with @entity7 in a bid to secure his deportation			1
this could include guarantees about his treatment on return to the country			0
it would be similar to a treaty signed between @entity5 and @entity99 which resulted in the deportation of hate cleric @entity101 earlier this year			0
another @entity34 mp , @entity102 , said : ‘ this is completely ridiculous			0
this man is not a @entity5 citizen , he is a foreign national and if we do n’t want him to be in our country we should be able to kick him out			0
people will be staggered that he is still here after 12 years			0
’ ' this is completely ridiculous			0
this man is not a @entity5 citizen , he is a foreign national and if we do n’t want him to be in our country we should be able to kick him out ' @entity102 , @entity34 mp the terrorist can not be named because the @entity76 granted him anonymity			2
last month ’s hearing is the latest stage in a mammoth legal battle fought by the terrorist , who first sought asylum here in 2001			1
in 1993 , he was convicted in @entity7 of involvement in a bombing at @entity18 the year before			1
he was sentenced to death in his absence			0
at the time of that trial he was in @entity28 , and in october 1999 he was convicted there of being a member of an organisation created with a view to the preparation of acts of terrorism			2
@entity8 was sentenced to two years ’ imprisonment and on his release in july 2001 he was made subject to an exclusion order			0
he fled to the @entity5 , where he claimed asylum			2
that claim was rejected but he has remained in the @entity5 ever since .			2

ministers powerless to expel @entity7 aged 50 and known only as ah
refused asylum because he can not claim refugee status as a terrorist
convicted in @entity7 in 1993 of complicity in @entity18 bombing
