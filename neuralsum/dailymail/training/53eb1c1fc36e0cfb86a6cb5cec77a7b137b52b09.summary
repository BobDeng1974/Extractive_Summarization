by @entity0 published : 06:08 est , 15 april 2013 updated : 08:51 est , 15 april 2013 plans to build the world 's largest optical telescope on top of a volcano in @entity6 have been approved			1
the plan by @entity8 and @entity10 universities call for a 30m telescope , the largest ever created			1
the $ 1bn telescope would be able to observe planets that orbit stars other than the sun and enable astronomers to watch new planets and stars being formed			1
the dormant volcano is popular with astronomers because its summit is well above the clouds at 13,796 feet , offering a clear view of the sky above for 300 days a year			2
the state 's isolated location in the middle of the @entity36 also means the area is relatively free of air pollution			2
few cities on the @entity40 mean there are n't a lot of man - made lights around to disrupt observations			0
it should also help scientists see some 13 billion light years away for a glimpse into the early years of the universe			0
construction costs are expected to top $ 1 billion			0
the telescope 's segmented primary mirror , which is nearly 100 feet ( 30 meters ) long , will give it nine times the collecting area of the largest optical telescopes in use today			1
its images will also be three times sharper			0
but the telescope may not hold the world 's largest title for long			1
a group of @entity66 countries plans to build the @entity67 , which will have a 138 - foot ( 42 - meter ) - long mirror			0
to build the world 's largest telescope at the summit of @entity6 's @entity25 volcano won approval from the state @entity74 on friday			1
the decision clears the way for the group managing the @entity80 project to negotiate a sublease for land with the @entity83			0
some @entity85 groups had petitioned against the project , arguing it would defile the mountain 's sacred summit			2
native hawaiian tradition holds that high altitudes are sacred and are a gateway to heaven			0
in the past , only high chiefs and priests were allowed at @entity25 's summit			1
the mountain is home to one confirmed burial site and perhaps four more			0
environmentalists also petitioned to stop the telescope on the grounds it would harm habitat for the rare wekiu bug			0
the board approved the project anyway , but imposed two dozen conditions including a requirement that employees be trained in culture and natural resources			0
how it will work : the @entity112 optics system , shown in the centre of the graphic , is a 138 - foot ( 42 - meter ) - long mirror an artist 's interpretation of the @entity80 's central mirror , shown as @entity112 in the above graphic the @entity121 system , the @entity122 and the @entity123 in @entity124 are spearheading the telescope			1
@entity126 , @entity127 and @entity128 have signed on to be partners			0
the @entity83 is involved because it leases the summit land from the state of @entity6			1
@entity25 's peak already hosts about a dozen telescopes			1
the dormant volcano is popular with astronomers because its summit is well above the clouds at 13,796 feet , offering a clear view of the sky above for 300 days a year			2
the giant telescope at sunset in an artist 's impression the 492 primary mirror segments are arranged in a circle 30 meters ( 98 feet ) across			1
the state 's isolated location in the middle of the @entity36 also means the area is relatively free of air pollution			2
few cities on the @entity40 mean there are n't a lot of man - made lights around to disrupt observations .			0

$ 1bn telescope will be built at the summit of @entity6 's @entity25 volcano
