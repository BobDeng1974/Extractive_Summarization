nobody ! ' if the recording is real , it would be the first time that @entity15 has been heard from since he was banned from the @entity50 for life following the first recording of his conversation with @entity54			0
@entity50 commissioner @entity79 has made it clear that he hopes that the league 's board of governors will vote to force @entity15 to sell the @entity84 basketball team that he has owned since 1981 , but in this latest recording , @entity1 made it clear that he does not intend to go without a fight			1
@entity88 : in april nba commissioner @entity79 ( pictured ) announced a lifetime suspension and a $ 2.5million fine for @entity1 after audio recordings of him making racist comments came to light ' you ca n’t force someone to sell property in @entity96 ! i ’m a lawyer , that ’s my opinion , ' @entity1 said			1

the punishment , which also included a $ 2.5million fine , came after the @entity50 investigated and met with @entity1 , but there are reports that his estranged wife @entity123 is also being investigated because of some old discrimination lawsuits from former tenants who accused her of using racial slurs .			2

a ' longtime friend ' recorded a call to @entity1 after the @entity50 ban
@entity1 questions how his friend could ' think i have anything in the world but love for everybody '
calls @entity58 ' a guy i respect so much ' but ca n't believe that the former @entity50 player did n't talk to @entity1 before condemning him
*argues* that he will never give up the team even though the @entity50 is holding conference calls this week to *strategize* a way to force @entity1 's hand
