by @entity0 follow @ @ laura_mail @entity1 , a @entity2 coach nicknamed ‘ @entity3 in a petticoat ’ , has made history by being appointed as the first woman to manage in the top two divisions of a major @entity9 league			1
the 36 - year - old , formerly head coach of @entity13 ’s national women ’s team , will take charge of @entity16 second tier side @entity15 at the end of the season , replacing @entity19			1
historic : @entity21 's @entity1 has been appointed manager of @entity16 @entity23 side @entity15 @entity24 met @entity3 at @entity25 , where she coached boys teams from under 9 to @entity28			1
she then served an internship with @entity32 ’s @entity31 and women ’s sides in 2005 during @entity3 ’s first spell at the club			1
her intense will to win drew comparisons with the @entity32 boss , prompting @entity24 to be tagged ‘ @entity3 in a petticoat ’			1
she has since gone on to work as a scout for @entity42 and gain respect as a coach in her own right in both the men ’s and women ’s games			1
as recently as 2010 , @entity24 said she did not expect to see a female managing a professional men ’s team for at least another 60 years			1
‘ working in professional football is a dream for me , ’ she added			2
‘ it will not happen quickly - maybe for my great - grandchildren			0
but i did not go to the @entity55 to train to give up			0
’ @entity15 defender @entity56 said club president @entity57 had already called several key players telling them to trust and respect his decision			1
but @entity56 claimed there would be ‘ no revolution ’ since the club already has a female physiotherapist , @entity63			1
‘ the physio sees us in our underwear all day ! ’ he said			2
‘ this appointment does not change much			2
after we take our shower i do not think she ( @entity24 ) will be there			1
comparisons : a former @entity25 youth coach , @entity24 was been dubbed ' @entity3 in a petticoat ' ‘ our coach has absolute authority			1
it ’s like with your boss , you have to respect him or her			2
it will be weird to some , but i do not mind			0
there will be no revolution			0
‘ she is a woman , but she is a coach , and will remain a coach			0
’ the @entity15 players were told on wednesday morning before training			1
striker @entity87 told @entity88 : ‘ it is a surprise , a big surprise			0
it came out of nowhere but it is good : it will create a buzz and will be a unique experience			0
‘ i ’m not macho			0
she has worked in the profession and all the boys know how it works			0
at first it will be a little weird but it will only last a few days			0
’ defender @entity98 added : ‘ i spoke with the physio about the first time a woman entered the army			2
it was a very macho environment			0
‘ now there are many women in the army and it may be the same in football			0
i can not wait for next season to discover			0
proven record : @entity24 has been head coach of the @entity13 and @entity113 women 's national teams ‘ it will be a unique experience to be the first professional football team in @entity16 to be managed by a woman			1
’ @entity24 , a @entity118 ‘ a ’ licensed coach , took @entity2 side @entity119 to the @entity121 in 2006			1
she remembers having to ‘ change the whole mentality in a town where women still had a very submissive role ’			2
she was eventually dismissed for ‘ lack of results ’ with the team topping the district championship table			2
@entity130 , president of @entity15 ’s supporters ’ club , said : ‘ it surprised us , but we all believe that it is a good thing			1
‘ the boys in the team can be difficult to manage			0
they can be quite sensitive , that is what the other coaches have told us			0
with a woman in charge , maybe they will be less demanding			0
