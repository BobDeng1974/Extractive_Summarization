by @entity0 if you think the recent bad weather has been a struggle , spare a thought for poor @entity5			1
the 26 - year - old is trapped indoors every time it rains due to a rare condition that means she ’s allergic to water			2
as such , miss @entity5 , from @entity12 , @entity13 , has been unable to go outside for the past month because a single drop will cause a painful itchy red rash			1
rain , rain go away : the recent stormy weather has been @entity5 's worst nightmare because she suffers from an extremely rare allergy to water ' it makes me feel like my skin is on fire ' : miss @entity5 ca n't even seek comfort from her fiance @entity28 ( right ) because the saliva from his kiss brings her out in a painful rash recent weather conditions - some of the wettest to hit the @entity33 in 200 years - have seen @entity34 housebound			1
and she ca n't even seek comfort from her fiance @entity28 , 28 , because the saliva from a kiss also causes a reaction			1
@entity40 ’s condition , @entity42 pruritis , means even a few drops of saliva from @entity28 could bring out an extremely itchy prickling - like rash			1
the allergy also means she can not go for long baths or even drink a cold glass of water as it makes her throat swell up whenever she takes a sip			2
the condition is so rare it ’s believed @entity34 is one of only about 35 people in the world who suffer from it			1
frustrating : her allergy also means she can not take long showers or baths without suffering a reaction struggle : miss @entity5 first noticed the allergy when she was 12 and the rash has gradually got worse over the years @entity40 , who is an artist , said : ' i never go out without checking the weather and because of the recent amount of rainfall we ’ve had , i ’ve been indoors a lot which i hate			1
' a single drop of rainfall can give me a painful allergic reaction that can last a few hours			2
' i always go out with a coat that has a big hood on it , as well as an umbrella , just in case it does suddenly rain			0
' i ’ve been staying in a lot lately which is so boring and depressing as i want to go out but i just ca n’t - it ’s not worth the risk			1
' it ’s so painful and red , i ’ve experienced people staring at me when an allergic reaction happens in a public place			1
' learning to cope : miss @entity5 has managed to adapt to daily life with her partner @entity28 after coming into contact with water - or @entity94 - a person with @entity96 develops painful , itchy hives that spread over the affected area			1
these can last anywhere between 10 minutes to an hour - and - a - half and some sufferers have to lie down to let the pain subside			0
investigators believe the hives are not caused by a histamine release but are the result of extreme skin sensitivity to additives in water such as chlorine			0
the condition is extremely rare and is thought to affect around 35 known people in the world and there is no proven treatment			1
@entity115 , of the @entity116 of @entity117 said : ' @entity42 might be associated with elevated blood histamine levels , but there are other processes at work and we do not yet fully understand the precise mechanisms that trigger the itchy rash			0
' as the disorder is very rare , there may be other reasons for your symptoms - for example an allergy to a bathing product , so accurate diagnosis is the first step			0
' @entity40 first noticed the allergy aged 12 and as she became older the rash worsened , making it almost impossible for her to be in contact with water without experiencing pain			2
she said : ' the rash makes me feel as though my skin is on fire and it itches as though i have a nettle rash			0
' i find it hard to drink anything too cold as it really hurts my throat and makes it feel uncomfortable and as though it ’s going to close			0
' for some reason juice and tea are easier to drink but i do n’t know why as they have water in too			0
' because my condition is so rare no - one has ever heard of it , some doctors have also refused to believe i ’m suffering from an allergy to water because it ’s that rare			0
' i ’m even allergic to sweat and tears - including my own blood when it gets in contact with my skin			0
' i used to love going swimming when i was younger but i ca n’t do that anymore , i ’d love nothing more than being able to paddle my feet in the sea			0
' despite @entity40 ’s painful condition , she has managed to adapt to daily life with her partner @entity28 and says that the allergy even has some positives			0
she said : ' it ’s not all bad as it does get me out of doing any washing up as if water touched my hands for a long period of time i would be in a lot of pain			2
' but there is a plus side ! miss @entity5 says it 's not all bad because she gets out of doing the washing up			2

@entity5 breaks out in a painful rash when in contact with water
even a few drops of saliva from her fiance 's kiss causes a reaction
thought to be one of only 35 people to suffer from @entity202
she said : ' i ’ve been staying in a lot lately which is so depressing '
