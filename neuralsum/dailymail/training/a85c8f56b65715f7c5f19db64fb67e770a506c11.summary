by @entity0 last updated at 5:16 pm on 22nd february 2012 an ‘ armed and dangerous ’ mountain recluse allegedly responsible for more than two dozen cabin burglaries in the wilderness has finally been identified by police after eluding them for half a decade			1
@entity6 , 44 , has only just been identified three years after his fingerprints were lifted from holiday homes near @entity9 in the @entity11 wilderness - and now police have to catch him			1
authorities have compared @entity14 to @entity15 , the 19th century @entity17 survival expert known as ' @entity18 ' , and he remains somewhere in 1,000 sq miles of wilderness			1
long search : @entity6 , 44 , has only just been identified three years after fingerprints were lifted from holiday homes near @entity9 in the @entity11 wilderness - and now police have to catch him @entity14 is a virtual ghost in the woods , stocked with stolen gear , food and guns			1
authorities have so far revealed little about him or how he ended up wandering the mountains of southern @entity11			1
@entity14 has family members in @entity33 , @entity34 , but they have not commented			2
just last week , @entity36 detectives said investigators had n't made a definite identification but were getting close			2
however , court records indicate charges were filed against @entity14 in neighbouring @entity41 about three weeks ago on january 27 as the key suspect in the serial burglaries			1
@entity14 's fingerprints from one cabin in 2009 were allegedly matched last month to a 2000 theft arrest in @entity47			1
he was convicted previous on charges of assault with a weapon and burglaries			1
mysterious : investigators have found abandoned camps in the @entity11 wilderness , like the one pictured , dozens of guns , high - end outdoor gear stolen from the homes and rubbish strewn around the forest floor ‘ this guy is probably about as true a survivalist as @entity15 , ’ @entity63 marshal @entity62 said , adding @entity14 ‘ dropped off everybody 's radar in 2003 and nobody has heard from him since ’			1
comparison : authorities say @entity14 is like @entity15 , a 19th century survival expert portrayed by @entity72 in the 1955 @entity74 film given his name ‘ he just dropped off the face of the earth , ’ @entity78 added , speculating @entity14 was ‘ fed up with civilisation			2
’ he faces counts of burglary and a weapons charge			2
the @entity83 said public tips and forensic evidence linked @entity14 to the crimes			2
‘ this suspect is known to be armed and could be possibly dangerous if cornered , ’ a spokesman said			2
the spokesman added that his identification was the result of ‘ good old - fashioned investigative work , along with tips provided by the public			1
’ ‘ we believe mr @entity6 is our guy , ’ mr @entity62 said			1
@entity83 's detective @entity96 said last week investigators were scouring for clues but getting close after they got the first pictures of the suspect from a @entity102 camera outside a cabin			1
the photos taken in december showed a sandy - haired man in camouflage on snowshoes , a rifle slung over his shoulder			1
detective @entity96 has been working on the case since 2007			2
@entity14 has allegedly eluded capture for five years , breaking into cabins in winter , living off hot food , alcohol and coffee before stealing provisions and vanishing away with guns and supplies			1
discoveries ; cabin owners are increasingly scared and carrying guns themselves in a protection attempt cabin owners are panicked			2
many said they were carrying their own guns and had grown to wonder who might be sleeping in their beds during winter			2
in recent weeks , it took detectives an entire day to reach a remote cabin after getting a report that lights had been seen on inside overnight			0
it turned out they were solar - powered lights on the porch , and the cabin was empty - another dead - end			1
but their break came in january with the fingerprint match			1
there have been no violent confrontations but detectives call him a time bomb			0
he has left some cabins tidy and clean , but others practically destroyed - defecating in a pan on the floor in one home			1
lately he has been leaving the cabins in disarray and riddled with bullets after defacing religious icons			0
a recent note left behind in one cabin warned : ‘ get off my mountain			0
’ in the january 27 court filing , authorities said @entity14 had left behind even more threatening notes aimed at law enforcement			0
‘ hey sheriff ... gon na put you in the ground ! ’ read one note			0
‘ he could stand in the trees and pop you off and no one would know who killed you , ’ cabin owner @entity168 said last week			0
when alerted of the latest news , a relieved mr @entity168 said : ‘ wow			0
’ ‘ that 's wonderful that they know him , ’ mr @entity168 added			0
‘ now they need to get him in custody			0
’ from the beginning , the suspect 's lore grew , leading to theories that he might have been two separate men on the @entity185			0
it was even suggested he could be a castaway from nearby compounds of the @entity189 , the polygamous sect run by jailed leader @entity191			0
early on , investigators thought his unattended summer camps they came across during their search were left behind by ‘ doomsday ’ believers preparing for some sort of apocalypse			0
this was because of the remote locations and supplies like dozens of guns , radios , batteries , dehydrated food and camping gear			0
they now have a name , but the man remains in the mist			0
‘ he 's scaring the daylights out of cabin owners			0
now everyone 's packing guns , ’ said @entity211 , 62 , a local mortgage adviser			0
‘ we feel like we 're being subject to terrorism by this guy			0
