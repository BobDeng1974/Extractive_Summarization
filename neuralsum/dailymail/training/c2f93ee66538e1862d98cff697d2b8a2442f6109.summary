by @entity0 published : 13:06 est , 31 january 2014 updated : 13:06 est , 31 january 2014 @entity2 has been in fashion for decades and now she 's revealed the rules she abides by when it comes to her timeless style			1
the 64 - year - old model revealed the secrets to her fashion success in an interview for the march issue of @entity12			1
and her top style rule is that your wardrobe should not be restricted by your age			1
still in style : @entity2 has been modelling since she was 16 ' i do n't like it when people say " you 're 45 , so you should be wearing x and never @entity23 "			1
for me , dressing is about attitude , not age , ' she said			0
she added that size is not important when it comes to looking good			0
' we all have bits that we do n't like but you do n't have to be a size 10 to look wonderful			0
' the trick is to find the style that is right for you			2
when it comes to trying new clothes my advice is not to take it too seriously - it 's all about having fun			2
' be adventurous : the designer said women should n't be afraid to wear bright colours she 's been in the modelling industry since the age of 16 and has learnt the best kind of style involves taking risks			1
' be adventurous and experiment – do n't be afraid to try something new			0
but if you do feel nervous , start with one on - trend item and build your outfit around it			0
' buy a colourful accessory – bright shoes will give you an instant confidence boost , ' she recommended			0
the @entity60 designer often makes colour one of her wardrobe staples and has n't shied away from as she 's aged , wearing a hot pink lace dress to her daughter @entity64 's wedding last summer			1
she received so many compliments that she has now launched it as part of her new @entity60 collection			1
' for special occasions i love pretty dresses – but nothing too frou - frou ! when i was planning my outfit for @entity64 's wedding last summer , i wanted something simple , chic and easy to wear			2
' i thought of the black lace dress from my last winter collection but i thought " i ca n't wear grey or black to my daughter 's wedding ! how about hot pink ? " the wedding was in the @entity85 and it was 84 degrees			1
everyone loved my dress so we are launching it online in february ! ' read the full interview in the march edition of @entity12 she admits that she does n't believe in the urban fashion myth that black flatters everyone , and will always opt for a brighter colour			2
' yes black is slimming but it 's not always youthful			2
the right tone of red , however , is flattering on all women			0
' @entity2 's collection for @entity60 follows this ethos revealing pops of red and leather skirts rather than black pullovers and loose - fitted shirts			1
the model will also open a pop up boutique at the @entity60 marble arch store on february 27th			1
unlike with many other celebrity clothing lines , @entity2 is quick to point out that she 's had a lot of involvement when putting together the collection and that she only designs pieces she would wear herself			1
' even before i was discovered in 1966 , i used to make my own clothes			0
i learned how to sew early on and it 's still my passion now			0
i constantly have ideas in my head about clothes so jumped at the chance to do my own collection and am very hands - on			0
everything i design i wear and i love			0
' for the full interview see the march issue of @entity126 , on sale now			0
