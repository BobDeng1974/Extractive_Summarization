at the last race in @entity2 , i was out there to win , but unfortunately it did n't quite work out for me			1
i narrowly missed out on pole position to @entity6 in qualifying , so my next chance was at the start of the race , but i did n't get away well and that is a weakness of our team at the moment			1
from then on , i was quicker than my team - mate during the race which was positive , once again , but in @entity2 it is very , very tough to follow the car ahead and not only that , but to pass the car ahead , too			1
you also have to factor in that we both have the same cars and identical machinery			0
chasing : @entity24 was faster than @entity25 in @entity2 but it 's a very tough track to overtake on in the lead : @entity25 has now won four races in a row - but @entity24 hopes to break his dominance so , we tried everything with the strategy , and the team gave me the best - possible chance to have a good chance of winning at the end of the race			1
the only way for the guy behind - which was me in this case - to have a chance of overtaking is to get a big speed differential at the end of the grand prix			2
so , you do that by taking on the hard @entity51 compound in a longer middle stint , and then finish the race on the soft , option tyre with a shorter stint			2
whereas the other guy - which was @entity6 - would have the hard compound tyre in the final stint			1
‎ this strategy is slower on total race time , but if you are quicker but stuck behind - as i was - it gives you the best possibility to overtake			1
i said after the race that i needed one more lap to give it a shot at overtaking @entity6 and that was definitely the case because it was so close			1
the race was just one lap too short for me			2
‎ too short : one more lap and the @entity72 driver would have had a shot at overtaking @entity25 it was amazing to see that not only did we retain our dominance in @entity77 , but maybe we even extended it , and that was spectacular from a team point of view and really showed that we have come of age and that we are really are becoming a serious force in @entity81 which is great and hugely impressive			1
i do n't believe that our dominance however , is having a negative impact on the sport			1
of course , i like having a quick car , but even at the races where @entity87 have been faster than the rest we have seen exciting races , like in @entity91 and @entity2 where @entity6 and i are battling each other			1
it is a fresh start for the sport and a change from the dominance of @entity97 and @entity98 , and i think that is a good thing for @entity81			2
dominance : @entity87 have now won the opening five races - but that is not a negative thing for the sport of course it is important to stop @entity6 because , at this moment in time , he has the result momentum and i need to try and break that this weekend			1
the @entity110 is very different to any other race			1
it is just that little bit more intense , and more spectacular with the track , the atmosphere - it is right in the city - and the fact that it is just amazing to drive			1
there is always loads happening , especially for the team and the sponsors and i also have my friends coming down for the weekend			0
i have a friend 's birthday party on the thursday , so i will be spending time with my mates , and with the race team doing numerous sponsor events			2
@entity110 is my home town , too , and i have great memories of winning there last year , so i am looking forward to racing there again			2
it is just the ultimate driving challenge			0
to get it right on a @entity110 lap is so difficult , so in my opinion , there is no tougher track on the calendar			1
winner : @entity24 celebrates his brilliant win at @entity110 last year - the race is his favourite on the calendar victory : the @entity110 race was one of two wins for the 28 - year - old last season as a team we are really thinking about the sport and we want to make it better			1
at last week 's test in @entity2 , we trialled this ' trumpet ' exhaust but unfortunately it did not have the effect on the sound when we took to the track as it did when we tested it back at the factory			1
so , everybody needs to keep working on it			0
the noise is an important part of the sport , and i understand that the fans want more sound so the sport has to find a solution			0
trumpet : the ' trumpet ' exhaust did not produce the desired noise , and everyone will keep working on it i spent last weekend at the @entity177 @entity176 which was really cool			0
it was the first time that i have been to a @entity176 event and it is very exciting to watch			0
the racing is spectacular and the machines are unbelievable ; they are so fast ! but it is not something i would ever like to have a go at			0
the risk , for me , is just one step beyond what i would be willing to take to have fun , so i think i 'll stick to my race car			2
it was amazing to meet @entity192 and some other drivers and to watch their starting procedure			0
spectacular : @entity24 spent last weekend at the @entity176 with the likes of @entity192 on the grid : @entity24 poses with @entity199 - born rider @entity198 , who eventually finished 9th i also managed to watch @entity201 's cup triumph over @entity202			0
we won 2 - 0 , and i saw the game with my whole family on the television			0
we had a bit of a lucky break to be honest , because @entity202 scored - the ball was well over the line - but it did n't count because the referee did n't think it had gone in			0
it was still great to get the victory , because winning is all that matters , but that said , they are not at their best , and they need to turn things round again			0
@entity201 's manager @entity220 has done a great job , but somehow the team has lost its touch			0
double : @entity24 was also at the @entity225 in @entity226 to watch @entity201 win the @entity227 over in @entity229 , you also had the @entity230 last weekend , and three @entity72 , @entity231 , @entity232 and @entity233 , were part of the winning team for @entity236 which is fantastic for the @entity237 because it will give them a huge confidence boost ahead of this summer 's tournament			2
i will meet our boys in the training camp next tuesday to do some photo shoots and marketing activities with @entity247			0
i always look forward to joining them before a big tournament			0
it ’s nice to exchange thoughts and get some impressions of how their training is going			0
@entity24 's fee for his column will be donated to the @entity256 , which is dedicated to providing help to former and current @entity81 mechanics and their families , putting @entity81 mechanics throughout the world in touch with each other and raising funds to help in times of need			0
you can follow @entity24 on @entity268 @ nico_rosberg and @entity87 @ @entity269			1

i started badly in @entity2 , which is a weakness of our team right now
despite being quicker than @entity6 during the race it is very tough to follow and pass the car ahead on that track
because of our tyre strategy , one more lap in the race and i could well have overtaken @entity6
@entity87 ' dominance is not having a negative impact on the sport
the @entity110 is an amazing race to drive - there is no tougher track on the calendar
