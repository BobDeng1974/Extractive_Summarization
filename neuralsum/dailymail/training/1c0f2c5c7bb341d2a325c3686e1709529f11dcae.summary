a popular 12 - mile stretch of country @entity1 running through one of the most picturesque parts of @entity5 has been named the nation ’s ‘ most persistently dangerous ’ highway			1
it is one of a number of ‘ beautiful but deadly ’ roads - many running through or near national parks and areas of outstanding beauty - where the toll of deaths and serious injuries are ‘ unacceptably high ’ , says a major new road safety report			1
the single - carriage @entity20 from @entity21 through the @entity22 to the coastal town of @entity24 runs north to south through @entity25 linking the @entity26 with the @entity27			1
@entity20 - 12 miles - @entity21 to @entity24 , @entity26 to @entity27 2			1
@entity33 - 10 miles - @entity34 to the @entity35 3			0
@entity37 - 8 miles - @entity36 to the @entity38 ( @entity39 ) 4			0
@entity40 - 10 miles - @entity41 to @entity42 near @entity43 5			0
@entity46 - 6 miles - @entity45 junction 33 to @entity47 6			0
@entity49 - 6 miles - @entity48 and the @entity51 junction 44 7			0
@entity53 - 4 miles - @entity52 to @entity54 in @entity55 8			0
@entity57 - 5 miles - full route around @entity47 9			0
@entity58 - 7 miles - @entity59 to @entity60 in @entity61 10 a4300 - 4 miles - full route through @entity63 source : @entity65 it is particularly popular with families and holidaymakers heading to the seaside and with visitors en route to events at @entity32 including horse - racing at ‘ @entity32 ’ the @entity74 and the @entity75			0
but the number of people killed or seriously injured ( @entity78 ) – the official measure of major road casualties – has risen there from 18 in the 2007 - 9 period to 21 in the period 2010 - 12 – an increase of 16.6 per cent			1
the report by the @entity65 notes how many routes through @entity85 – as this one does – show a particularly high degree of risk			0
it says 64 people are killed or seriously injured on @entity5 ’s roads every day with six out of ten fatal crashes occur on rural roads			1
the report concludes : ‘ the @entity5 ’s persistently highest - risk road is a stretch of less than 12 miles in @entity25			1
‘ the @entity20 between @entity24 and @entity21 runs north to south linking the @entity26 with the @entity27 and runs through the @entity22			1
‘ it tops the list of high - risk and medium - high risk roads which have shown little or no change over time or significant increases in the number of crashes			1
’ the route has ‘ a significant number of bends ’ , it notes : ‘ it has seen a 16 per cent increase in the number of fatal and serious crashes over time – at junctions , running off the road and even head - on collisions			1
’ a 10 - mile stretch of the @entity33 between @entity34 and the @entity35 is the next most ‘ persistently high risk ’ road followed by an eight - mile stretch of the @entity37 between @entity36 and the @entity38 ( @entity39 ) , and 10 - mile run of the @entity40 between @entity41 and @entity42 near @entity43 where in april last year five people were killed in a head - on smash between a cat and a lorry			1
the @entity65 says the number of people killed on the road has risen in the period of 2010 - 2012 @entity127 : @entity129 - 7 miles - @entity128 to @entity130 @entity131 : @entity20 - 12 miles - @entity26 ( @entity24 ) to @entity21 @entity132 : @entity33 - 10 miles - @entity34 to @entity35 @entity133 : @entity135 - 24 miles - @entity134 to @entity136 @entity137 : @entity138 - 3 miles - @entity139 to @entity140 ( @entity141 ) @entity61 & @entity142 : @entity49 - 6 miles - @entity48 to @entity143 @entity144 : @entity146 - 4 miles - full route through @entity63 @entity147 : @entity149 - 5 miles - @entity148 ( @entity150 ) to @entity151 @entity152 : @entity154 - 7 miles - @entity153 to @entity155 ( @entity156 on @entity157 ) @entity158 : @entity160 - 10 miles - @entity159 to @entity161 source : @entity65 it is followed by a six - mile stretch of the @entity46 between the @entity45 junction 33 to @entity47 , a 5 - mile stretch of the @entity49 between @entity48 and the @entity51 junction 44 , four miles of the @entity53 between the @entity167 and @entity54 in @entity55 , five miles of the @entity57 around @entity47 , seven miles of the @entity58 between @entity59 and @entity60 in @entity61 , and four miles of the @entity146 through @entity63			1
the report called ‘ how safe are you on @entity5 ’s roads ? ’ sponsored by @entity169 is to be published today ( @entity173 ) at a briefing in the @entity175 and notes : ’ once again , the top route is a route that goes through a national park			1
‘ the safety measures taken so far are not enough to tackle the route			0
it requires a more far reaching intervention along the 12 - mile length of the route which make junctions and roadsides safer in particular			0
’ the most improved road is the @entity187 ( @entity188 ) between @entity189 and @entity190 in @entity192 shire where a major speed limit review in the county ‘ resulted in the route being targetted with a speed limit reduction from 40mph to 30mph through two short sections of one - mile and half - a - mile through @entity188			2
’ vehicle activated signs , road resurfacing and junction improvements , new reflective bollards , better street lighting , and renewed cats - eyes , all contributed , said the report			2
the report also highlights how low cost safety improvements carried out by highway authorities and council to coincide with routine maintenance have helped reduce fatal and serious crashes by 80 per cent on 15 of the previously most dangerous stretches of @entity5 roads			1
this has seen deaths and serious injuries fall from 237 to 52 in the three years after action was taken			0
it says : ’ the economic value of just these few low cost improvements is estimated at a staggering £ 0.4billion			0
’ across all regions and highways , single carriageways were by far the most dangerous road type for drivers			1
pictured : @entity46 road through the @entity228 in @entity229 it points out how improvements including speed reductions on one notorious and ’ infamous ’ accident black spot – the so - called ‘ @entity233 ’ route on the @entity129 – had seen it fall from being the most dangerous to ‘ 28th in the list of ‘ most improved ’ routes			2
half of the cost of all fatal crashes on the @entity5 road network occurs on the 10 per cent of roads surveyed and mapped in the @entity65 ’s report , it says			1
@entity5 suffers annual serious injury costs alone of £ 0.3 billion on motorways , £ 0.6 billion on national trunk roads and £ 2 billion on local authority ‘ a ’ roads			2
it says the safety of roads has not kept pace with safety improvements in cars : ‘ we should not be driving five - star cars on one - and two - star roads			2
it is time to set a national goal that our ‘ a ’ roads should achieve a minimum three - star safety rating with four - and five - star ratings for our busiest trunk roads and motorways			2
’ the @entity144 has been revealed as the highest risk region in @entity5 for the first time regional breakdowns show that the risk and cost of death and serious injury on the major roads of the worst performing @entity144 is two thirds higher than the best - performing @entity152			2
it notes : ‘ this difference is larger than between many countries ’			0
by contrast , the @entity152 and @entity132 are the two regions improving most quickly			0
the report says : ‘ the differing risk in each regions is mainly due to the amount of travel there is on safe roads and how much on risky roads			2
the motorways in the @entity131 have been shown to have the highest risk of all motorways in @entity5 however , for single carriageways , the highest risk of accident exists in the @entity127 ‘ even an average single carriageway ‘ a ’ road is seven times riskier than a motorway			1
some roads represent more than 20 times the risk of others			0
@entity300 , engineering manager for the @entity65 said : ‘ the busier the road , the more frequently any flaw in layout leads to death and serious injury			0
’ @entity65 chairman , @entity306 said : ‘ we can no longer accept sudden , violent road death as such a significant cause of premature loss of life			0
the @entity5 government must design , plan and legislate to put safety on roads on the same footing as safety in the air , sea or on rail			1
’ the dossier complements a second report also published today ( @entity173 ) by the @entity65 called ‘ @entity323 ’ which makes recommendations for the government to adopt in a bid to achieve ‘ zero road deaths ’ within a decade			2
these include : a zero @entity328 ( @entity330 ) rate for insured vehicles fitted with a telematics unit for drivers under the age of 25 ; low speed @entity335 ( @entity335 ) mandatory as standard on all new cars ; and minimum inbuilt 4 - star safety rating levels for the busiest national roads and minimum 3 - stars for all other national roads by 2025 .			0

single carriageway from @entity21 to @entity24 named most dangerous
half of all fatal crashes in the @entity5 happen on the roads surveyed
number of people seriously injured or killed has increased 16.6 *%*
report offers safety recommendations and road improvement *suggestions*
