by @entity0 published : 06:39 est , 15 october 2012 updated : 13:18 est , 15 october 2012 a 65 - year - old @entity2 woman who lost her home in the credit crunch is leading a class - action suit against 12 of the world 's major banks for their part in the financial crisis			1
@entity11 claims banks including @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 , manipulated the @entity17 rates to make mortgage repayments more expensive than they should have been			1
the suit alleges the @entity17 - the rate at which banks lend to each other - was artificially changed at times when it would have a big impact on adjustable mortgage rates , ' unjustly enriching ' the bankers at the cost of mortgage - holders losing their homes			1
wide - reaching : the class - action suit takes in 12 banks , including some of the biggest names in @entity33 , as well as banks based in @entity35 @entity37 's financial district : banks from across the world , including @entity13 and @entity40 , have been named in the suit , which was filed in @entity42 the class action lawsuit , originating in @entity44 , alleges the rate - fixing meant homeowners paid thousands more than necessary between 2000 and 2009 - with the knock - on effect causing many families to lose their homes			1
the group of 12 banks also includes @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity40 , @entity56 , @entity57 and the @entity58			0
@entity17 , or the ' @entity37 interbank offered rate ' , is seen as the benchmark for more than $ 300trillion of loans and securities , and is re-calculated on a daily basis , based on groups of lenders estimating their borrowing rates			1
but the suit alleges this rate was artificially changed at times when it would have a big impact on adjustable mortgage rates			1
this allowed them to increase the payments by homeowners on adjustable rate loans , boosting profit , according to the lawsuit			0
what is @entity17 ? it is the @entity17 - the rate at which international banks lend to each other			2
it is calculated every business day in 10 currencies and 15 timespans , ranging from overnight to one year and is based on the level at which banks have been lending to each other			2
when is it set ? it is set and announced at around 11am to midday for the @entity35 rate , based on borrowing from the previous day			0
operating since the mid- 1980s , in the years before the credit crunch it sat marginally higher than the central bank rate			0
why is it important ? the sterling three - month libor rate influences the level at which lenders set some rates on loans , especially mortgages , to consumers and to businesses			2
it also impacts on the amount they will lend			0
it is the rate at which banks lend to each other and is therefore a measure of how much they trust each other and a measure of the credit crunch			0
there tends to be a lag from when @entity17 changes to when bank lending rates are altered			2
also , some new mortgage deals have been linked to @entity17 rather than bank rate or a lender 's @entity122			2
that 's because it is more closely linked to a lenders ' costs			0
what would libor be in ' normal ' conditions ? the three - month libor rate should be just 10 or 20 basis points higher than the bank rate if conditions went back to how they were in the first half of this decade			2
so under pre-credit crunch conditions , if the bank rate or base rate is 2 % , @entity17 should be 2.1 % or 2.2 % but it soared far higher in august 2007 , marking the start of the credit crunch			0
it recovered over the summer of 2008 ( see the figures above ) as some trust returned but then spiked on the collapse of @entity143 ( 15/16 sept 2008 )			0
@entity13 , @entity35 â€™s second - biggest lender by assets , is the only bank to have settled with regulators over the rigging of @entity17			1
it is the first class - action lawsuit filed by home owners , according to the @entity149 , which said other class - action suits have been brought by investors and municipalities			1
@entity11 's sub-prime mortgage was securitised into @entity17 - based collateralised debt obligations and sold on by banks to investors			2
the plaintiffs , who have lost thousands of dollars each , could number 100,000 , their @entity44 - based attorney @entity156 said			0
there are at least 900,000 homes in the @entity35 with loans linked to @entity17 , with an unpaid principle balance of more than $ 275billion			0
@entity163 declined to give a figure on the total damages his clients are seeking			0
under fire : @entity169 and @entity13 are both named in the suit the lawsuit claims that increasing @entity17 allowed banks ' to raise the interest rates paid by the plaintiffs on their adjustable - rate notes ' it says that many adjustable - rate mortgages had the first day of the month as a ' change date ' on which new repayment rates would reset , it adds			1
the @entity149 adds that the lawsuit claims , upon statistical analysis , that @entity17 rose consistently on the first day of each month between 2000 and 2009			1
it claims that , between 2007 and 2009 , @entity17 moved as much as 7.5 basis points for certain certain reset days			1
faith in the @entity17 interest rate system , which underpins more than $ 300 trillion of contracts and loans from @entity2 mortgages to @entity188 interest - rate swaps , plummeted after @entity13 was fined in june for rigging it			1
other banks are under investigation .			0
