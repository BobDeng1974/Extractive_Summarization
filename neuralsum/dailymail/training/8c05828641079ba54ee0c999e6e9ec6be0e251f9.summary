@entity0 has told the @entity2 board he needs two signings this month to safeguard the club ’s @entity5 status			1
a new centre back and a defensive midfielder are the positions @entity0 wants to strengthen			0
the summer sale of @entity11 and the shoulder injury sustained by @entity13 against @entity14 last sunday have left @entity2 ’s defence depleted			1
@entity16 ( right ) tussles with @entity17 ... and could the pair be lining up on the same side soon ? @entity16 is seen as the sort of commanding influence which @entity2 's rearguard is so badly missing @entity23 ’s @entity16 is a main target , along with @entity26 youngster @entity25			2
with @entity27 ( ankle ) and @entity29 ( calf ) sidelined , @entity0 is eager to bolster his midfield , though first - choice @entity32 of @entity33 wo n’t be available until the summer			0
@entity2 have been offered @entity35 ’s @entity34 on loan until the end of the season .			0

@entity0 badly needs to strengthen his defence and midfield to mount a serious @entity5 *charge*
