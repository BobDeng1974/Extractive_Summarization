by @entity0 published : 08:57 est , 4 april 2012 updated : 10:51 est , 4 april 2012 the horrifying brutality with which an eight - year - old girl was raped and murdered has been laid bare as graphic photographs of her mutilated body were shown to a packed courtroom			1
@entity7 may still have been alive as she was being stamped on and beaten with a hammer before her corpse was stuffed into plastic bags and buried beneath a pile of rocks , jurors heard			1
but perhaps most haunting of all , was what she was wearing when her decomposed body was found 103 days later - just a @entity18 t - shirt with the words : ' a girl can dream			1
' when @entity7 was abducted , it was the first day she had been allowed to walk home from school on her own and it was for that reason she was singled out by @entity27 and @entity7 jurors wept and the little girl 's father ran out as the court viewed the pictures , some of which were so horrifying that the judge banned even the reporting of their content			1
the blonde and blue - eyed @entity39 fan went missing on her way home from school in @entity44 , @entity45 , on april 8 , 2009 , sparking a hunt for the little girl that would last for three months			2
local drug addicts @entity7 , 31 , and @entity7 , 21 , were arrested a month later and charged with her murder			2
in april 2010 , @entity27 pleaded guilty and was sentenced to life , while @entity7 denied all charges			2
before showing the pictures , @entity45 state pathologist dr. @entity53 warned jurors at @entity7 's trial : ' while you might recognize some of the body , you might not recognize all of it			1
' he went on to tell how the bottom half of @entity62 's body was so decomposed by the time she was found that it was impossible to tell if she had been raped or not			1
but he did tell the court what was clear was that she had been stamped on , strangled and beaten with a hammer			1
trial : @entity7 , 31 , has pleaded not guilty to murder , sexual assault and abduction he said 16 of her 24 ribs were broken and her liver was lacerated in injuries consistent with blunt trauma such as stamping			2
he said there were ' so many fractured to the skull ' that it was difficult to see where one ended and another began			0
he told the courtroom , which included @entity62 's parents , grandparents , aunts and uncles , that of four areas of her head that had been smashed , three were from a hammer 's claw and one with its blunt end			1
he said that various fractures to her face could have been the result of kicking , stomping or blows from a hammer			0
in the end , @entity62 died due to bleeding from the head wounds , brain damage and asphyxiation , he said			1
it is not clear know how long she was alive after she was kicked and stomped			0
@entity7 , who has pleaded not guilty to first - degree murder , sexual assault causing bodily harm and abduction , appeared unmoved by what the court heard			1
he sat in the prisoner ’s box with his eyes either half closed or looking up at the ceiling			0
and in a further move that caused huge offence , @entity7 wore a new purple shirt and grey and purple tie - @entity62 's favourite colour and the colour that has become the emblem of her family throughout the trial			1
@entity62 's body was found in woods adjoining a farmer ’s field stuffed in plastic bags and buried under a pile of rocks			2
previously , @entity7 's girlfriend , @entity27 , told the court how she and @entity7 singled out the little girl because she was on her own - the first day she was allowed to walk back from school alone - and lured her to the car by saying they had a schitzu puppy			1
@entity27 was high on @entity141 , as she was most days , and had also smoked marijuana			0
happy child : @entity7 loved @entity18 and was looking forward to going home that day so she could play in her newly decorated room and watch @entity39 parents : @entity147 , father of slain @entity7 , left , left the court as the graphic pictures of her body were shown			1
the girl 's mother , @entity153 , right , stayed for the duration the drug - addicted couple made three stops , she said , to pick up @entity158 , a highly - addictive narcotic pain killer , coffee and a hammer and garbage bags before arriving at the remote area chosen to kill the innocent school girl			1
@entity27 said she ' knew what was about to happen ' , so walked away from the car			0
when pressed as to what that was , she replied : ' i believed he was going to rape her			0
' after @entity7 sexually assaulted @entity62 the first time in the front seat of his @entity173 , during which time she could hear screams and cries for help , he called @entity27 to take her to the toilet , she told the court			2
disturbing case : @entity180 ' @entity179 was only eight - years - old when she was abducted , sexually assaulted and murdered by a couple who were high on drugs the 21 - year - old recalled @entity62 was bleeding and crying and pleaded with her : ' just do n't let him do it to me again			2
' ' i told her i was sorry and that she was a very strong girl			0
and she said " like you ? " and i told her she was much stronger ' , she testified			0
the convicted child killer then took @entity62 back to @entity7 , so he could commit the senseless , depraved act again			2
@entity7 's former girlfriend told the packed courtroom that as they were walking back to the car , @entity62 would n't let go of her hand			1
all she was wearing was her favourite @entity18 t - shirt			1
' she asked me to stay with her			0
i tried to hold on to her hand but i could n’t stay because i knew what was going to happen , ' said the former drug addict			0
' i could n’t be there for that			0
' testimony : @entity7 , then 18 , pleaded guilty to the murder of @entity7 and is the key witness in the murder trial of @entity7 , her ex-boyfriend and co-accused court sketch : @entity7 took to the stand for the second time today as she recounted the horrific details of @entity7 's murder at the hands of her and @entity7 ' i kept having flashbacks			1
sometimes it was like i was n’t even there , ' she said			0
' i realized i needed to do something so i turned back to the vehicle and			0
when i saw what was going on , all i saw was myself when i was that age and all the anger and hate and rage that i ’d had and blame that i still feel towards myself came boiling up out of me			0
' she walked back to the car , put a garbage bag over @entity62 's head and started to kick her			0
she then struck her repeatedly with both sides of the hammer on the head , she told the court			2
i went back to the vehicle and i savagely murdered that little girl , ' she said to a stunned and horrified courtroom			0
they both buried the body , she recounted , before washing themselves and the car so no evidence could be found			0
the pair had been dating just over a month when they carried out the gruesome crime			0
@entity27 said it was @entity7 's idea and said they would be like @entity246			1
