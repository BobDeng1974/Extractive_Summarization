@entity9 , @entity5 spokesman , said today that @entity2 and her band , the @entity11 , will be moved to another float			1
@entity9 said that the annual parade in @entity14 is about entertainment , not advocacy , and that @entity1 's was making the change ' to prevent any further distraction from our entertainment mission			1
' @entity2 ( seen in @entity21 in april ) will no longer be park of the @entity1 's tourism float in their @entity5 in @entity4 ' @entity24 has never taken on , promoted or otherwise engaged in social commentary , political debate , or other forms of advocacy , no matter how worthy , ' @entity9 said in a statement			1
' @entity1 intention is only to provide a range of entertaining elements and performers free of endorsements or agendas			2
' a new performer for the @entity4 float will be announced later , @entity9 said			0
some @entity4 farmers and ranchers voiced concern about the choice to put @entity2 on the float because she is a supporter of @entity44 , which promotes a vegetarian diet and criticizes livestock production practices			1
@entity49 president @entity48 , who farms and ranches near @entity52 in eastern @entity4 , said earlier this week that he thinks it was a mistake to select @entity2 because her stands do n't mesh with a state where the cattle industry makes up a huge part of the economy			2
@entity60 , @entity44 's senior vice president , said friday to @entity0 that he 's happy with the publicity generated by the controversy			0
@entity5 ( seen in @entity14 ) wants to keep its entertainment value and not be distracted by other issues ' thanks to @entity4 's reactionary ranchers , people across the country have learned why @entity2 supports @entity44 , ' @entity60 said			1
' the meat trade ca n't stand any scrutiny of its cruelty , ' he said			0
@entity4 tourism secretary @entity72 has said that many people mistakenly assumed state officials selected @entity2 to appear on the float			1
none of the artists the state proposed were available or willing to appear in the parade , so @entity1 's selected @entity2 and the @entity11 , he said			1
@entity80 , a spokeswoman for @entity2 said earlier this week that @entity2 has played in @entity4 countless times and is a fan of the state			2
@entity2 just accepted a gracious offer to appear on @entity4 's float , @entity80 said			2
the state pays $ 175,000 to support the @entity5 and have a float in the event , and $ 5,000 of that goes to pay expenses for the artist on the float , officials have said			0
the @entity4 float , which has appeared each year since 2010 , features @entity93 , the @entity94 , the @entity95 and more			0
@entity96 , the singer of @entity97 , appeared on the float last year			0
previous years ' entries featured @entity100 and @entity101			0
