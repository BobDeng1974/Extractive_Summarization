by @entity0 published : 08:48 est , 14 november 2012 updated : 12:18 est , 14 november 2012 a @entity2 in @entity3 is being used as a ' black jail ' for people who dare to complain about life under the communist regime , it has been claimed			1
a group of alleged victims say they were snatched on their way to @entity11 to air their grievances over being forcibly removed from their homes to make way for an expansion of @entity18 's @entity17 in 2005			1
their plan was to hand in a petition to the10 - day annual meeting of @entity3 's legislature in march , @entity19 reported			1
@entity24 ? @entity25 was among five people stopped by plain - clothes police officers and hauled back to the @entity29 in @entity30 - located in @entity31 on the outskirts of @entity18 but during the 665 - mile journey from their home to the @entity3 capital , they were stopped by plain - clothes police and hauled back to the @entity29 in @entity39 - located in @entity31 on the outskirts of @entity18			1
there they say they were held for eight days until the conference was over , locked in a room under 24 - hour guard and tied to the bed if they tried to escape			1
@entity25 said all she and her husband wanted was to complain about the compensation they received after their farmhouse was demolished leaving them homeless			1
instead they were locked in separate rooms where they were told they would be given ' classes about petitioner regulations '			0
security : soldiers guard the @entity61 , home to the annual @entity62 , which the petitioners claim they were prevented from attending but @entity25 says she received no such classes			1
she was kept in a third - storey room under the watchful eye of two female officers			0
she became so desperate and frightened that , at one point , she tried to escape over the balcony , only to be met by seven more officers who escorted her back to the room			0
' i really felt quite sick inside , ' told @entity19			0
' [ they ] put me on the bed and used the bedspread to hold me down			0
' the couple , who now live in a tiny apartment near the airport where her son works as a janitor , were among five people who claimed to have been held against their will at the @entity2			1
when contacted by @entity19 , the @entity85 ( @entity85 ) - the @entity86 - based firm that owns the @entity29 brand - said there was no indication any of their rooms had been used to incarcerate recalcitrant citizens			1
a spokeswoman did however say a group of rooms were booked by a government official from the @entity17 district of @entity18 on the days in question			1
expansion : a group of alleged victims say they were snatched on their way to @entity11 to air their grievances over being forcibly removed from their homes to make way for an expansion of @entity18 's @entity17 in 2005 ( pictured ) but when asked to disclose any @entity109 footage of the period , @entity85 refused saying all tapes were erased after a month			1
an @entity85 statement read : ' we have found no evidence which would confirm these accusations or any sign that the hotel owner knew or cooperated with ( the ) government on this hotel stay and the hotel is operated in accordance with @entity3 [ @entity3 ] local laws and regulations			1
' they added that a ' full investigation ' had taken place and that details of any guests could not be revealed because of privacy laws			0
up to 10,000 people a year are hauled off the streets , locked up and beaten in the makeshift prisons in abandoned factories or converted apartment blocks , according to @entity136 - based @entity135			1
they are snatched on their way to hand in petitions listing their grievances to the authorities in @entity11 and other big cities			2
and the kidnappers are paid by local officials who get black marks against their names if too many citizens from their area lodge complaints			0
petitioners are held for days or months in the detention centres , deprived of food and sleep , beaten and threatened , say campaigners			2
@entity135 blames a civil service points system that penalises officials if too many people from their area complain to the central government and rewards those who minimise grievances			2
because bonuses and promotions depend on how many points they have , it is economical for officials to pay kidnappers to intercept , detain and intimidate petitioners , it said			0
@entity19 reporters did approach the hotel directly and were told by a front desk worker that there were a number of guests who were staying in their rooms and were not leaving , and there were people standing outside their room , but that they had no idea why			2
@entity177 said they had interviews all staff at the hotel and none had stood up the claims			0
dissenters being held against their will in @entity3 is nothing new			2
but activists say this is the first time a facility run by a foreign body has been allegedly used for unlawful detentions			2
@entity191 , a senior @entity192 researcher with the @entity136 - based @entity135 told @entity19 : ' from our research and research from domestic @entity3 human rights [ groups ] , people are held from a few days to several months and routinely subjected to physical abuse , sleep deprivation and very often they have to buy their way out of custody			1
' the government has denied there are any such black jail facilities in @entity3			2
even though [ @entity3 ] state media run stories about black jails , there is an official disconnect			1
' up to 10,000 people a year are hauled off the streets , locked up and beaten in the makeshift prisons in abandoned factories or converted apartment blocks			0
they are snatched on their way to hand in petitions listing their grievances to the authorities in @entity11 and other big cities			0
and the kidnappers are paid by local officials who get black marks against their names if too many citizens from their area lodge complaints			0
petitioners are held for days or months in the detention centres , deprived of food and sleep , beaten and threatened , according to a recent report from @entity136 - based @entity135			2
the jails become most crowded at politically sensitive times , such as during big meetings and visits , when the @entity239 wants to show the capital at its most orderly , activists said			0
police allegedly aided the captors or refused to intervene in several cases , the report said			0
but the report said the secret prisons are run as a lucrative business			0
it blamed a civil service points system that penalises officials if too many people from their area complain to the central government and rewards those who minimise grievances			0
because bonuses and promotions depend on how many points they have , it is economical for officials to pay kidnappers to intercept , detain and intimidate petitioners , it said			0
@entity3 's petitions offices were developed as a safety valve to ease social discontent by giving citizens a channel to complain and giving officials a window into their worries			1
but an alleged internal government directive from southern @entity3 revealed officials get two points if they bring petitioners back from @entity11 or the provincial capital of @entity271 , while those who fail to do so have a half - point deducted			2
officials typically pay black jails between £ 13 and £ 26 a day to hold complainants until they can be picked up and returned home			1
police are aware of the prisons but ignore them because they keep potentially troublesome petitioners away from cities , the report said .			0
