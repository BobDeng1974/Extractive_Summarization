by @entity1 reporter published : 02:18 est , 7 january 2014 updated : 08:45 est , 7 january 2014 the aging activists revealed to be behind a 1971 break - in at a @entity8 @entity7 office - shedding light on a controversial surveillance program - felt compelled to take part , they said			1
@entity11 , 80 , and his wife , @entity12 , were part of an eight - member group of @entity17 protesters that broke into the offices in @entity19 and left with 1,000 documents that revealed details of a domestic @entity7 spying operation known as @entity23			1
' we did it ... because somebody had to do it , ' mr @entity11 , a retired professor of religion at @entity25 , told @entity30			2
revealed : @entity11 and @entity31 have finally come forward after 43 years to admit they were two of the burglars who stole classified documents from the @entity7 offices in @entity8 in 1971 ' in this case , by breaking a law - entering , removing files - we exposed a crime that was going on			1
when we are denied the information we need to have to act as citizens , then we have a right to do what we did			0
' his wife added : ' i was horrified that our government was lying to us about what was actually happening in @entity49			0
and all the usual things we always did - picketing , marching , signing petitions - did n't make any difference whatsoever			0
' the case has similarities with that of @entity56 , who last year leaked details of the @entity59 's controversial surveillance programs			1
mr @entity11 said he had a message for @entity56			2
' from one whistelblower to another whistleblower - hi ! ' he said , lifting his arm to wave			0
the couple and a former @entity66 cab driver , @entity31 , identified themselves in new book ' the burglary : the @entity70 's @entity7 ' written by former @entity72 reporter @entity71			1
@entity71 was the first reporter to write a story about their findings			0
passionate : the couple , left , said they had to break - in the files because nothing else was working in their battled against the government			1
the @entity7 released this sketch of @entity84 after the break in satellite : the group targeted the @entity7 's smaller media branch because they thought there was less risk involved scene : the team broke in to the office , pictured , after studying its layout for weeks before in the book , the group also details how they pulled it off and managed to stay anonymous when @entity97 dispatched 200 agents to find the culprits			1
the sting was organized by @entity102 physics professor @entity101 who has since died			0
instead of breaking into the @entity7 's main office , they decided to aim for the less - guarded media office at a time when no one would notice : march 8 , the night @entity108 fought @entity109			1
in the weeks leading up to the break - in , the group cased the office in their hippie van and even sent in @entity31 dressed as a college student to get details on the interior layout of the office			1
' i tried to disguise my appearance as much as i could , ' mrs @entity118 told @entity30			0
' i had long , dark , hippie hair at that time and i stuffed it up inside of a winter hat			0
' she pretended to interview an @entity7 official about job prospects for women for the school paper , and never once took off her gloves the whole time so she would n't leave any finger prints			2
tricks : @entity12 , left , posed as a student to check out the inside of the office and helped break in on the night of the robbery			2
her husband , @entity11 , right , stayed outside in a getaway car as they broke in political : @entity11 and @entity31 said the change the break - in caused far outweighed breaking the law on the night of the break - in the group only ran into one roadblock			1
they were forced to use another entrance to the office since the main door 's lock could n't be picked			2
a back door ceded easily to a crow bar however and the group of eight tore through the office 's cabinets looking for incriminating papers			1
after the break - in at @entity19 , @entity8 in 1941 , the team left with more than 1,000 documents that they looked through and then filtered to the media			1
their central discovery was about @entity23			2
@entity161 , it was originally @entity97 's solution to break - up communist groups			1
it tracked the activity of domestic political groups it considered subversive			0
it aimed to discredit those in the group and destroy their public image			2
it was later used in plans to bring down the @entity174 , anti-vietnam war movements and other civil rights groups			0
a @entity178 group later determined that legal restrictions had been ignored in creating the program , and asked : ' what happened to turn a law enforcement agency into a law violator ? ' @entity97 cancelled the program in 1972 after it was exposed by the break - in			1
mr @entity11 was waiting outside			0
' i was sitting by myself in my station wagon and i was getting very very scared , ' he said			0
the team took as much as they could and fled to a nearby barn where they went through the information looking for anything of interest			0
eventually they sent the documents to journalists who were able to contextualize the information and reveal one majorly controversial @entity7 operation called @entity23			1
' these documents were explosive , ' said @entity71 , who received a batch of the files anonymously in the mail			0
' the @entity7 was never the same			0
' short for @entity23 , @entity23 was originally @entity97 's solution to break - up communist groups			1
the point of the program was to discredit those in the group and destroy their public image			2
it was later used in plans to bring down the @entity174 , anti-vietnam war movements and other civil rights groups			0
@entity97 cancelled the program in 1972 after it was exposed by the break - in			1
' it looks like we 're terribly reckless people , ' mr @entity11 , now 80 , told the @entity216			0
' but there was absolutely no one in @entity220 - senators , congressmen , even the president - who dared hold @entity97 to accountability			2
it became pretty obvious to us , that if we did n't do it nobody will			0
' his wife added to @entity30 that their theft uncovered ' massive illegal surveillance and intimidation '			0
@entity31 , another burglar to come forward , said the only way to convince people of the @entity7 's operations was to ' get it in their handwriting ' discovery : the group 's heist revealed the @entity7 's @entity240 program which @entity97 ( left ) cancelled in 1972			1
on the right , the new book detailing the heist , written by a former @entity72 reporter comparisons : the couple said ' hi ! ' to fellow whistleblower @entity56 , who leaked details of an @entity59 surveillance program last year after sending off the documents , the group never met together again and thus escaped being caught by the @entity7			1
five of the eight have come forward in the book , and face no legal repercussions since they are outside the statue of limitations			0
in the end , they believe the change the break - in caused far outweighed breaking the law - but not everyone agrees			1
' i donâ € ™ t believe such people have the right to take it upon themselves and make decisions about what should be made public , ' former @entity7 agent @entity263 told @entity30			2
' these are the same type of people that would look upon @entity56 as perhaps a patriot when ... in my opinion , he was a traitor			0

@entity11 and @entity31 were part of an 8 - member anti-war group that broke into the @entity7 satellite office in @entity19 , @entity8 on march 8 , 1971
culprits never caught despite @entity97 putting 200 agents on case
the break - in revealed the @entity7 's surveillance program @entity23 which was cancelled after public *scrutiny*
five of the eight members have identified themselves in a new book
