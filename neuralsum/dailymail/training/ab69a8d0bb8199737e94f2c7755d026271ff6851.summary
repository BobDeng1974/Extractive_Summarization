by @entity1 reporter published : 20:56 est , 9 december 2013 updated : 21:02 est , 9 december 2013 expectations of continued rises in house prices hit a 14 - year high in november , with almost two - thirds of surveyors predicting the value of homes will increase as demand outstrips supply			1
the @entity11 ( @entity11 ) said on tuesday that 59 per cent of surveyors forecast prices would rise over the next three months , the highest reading since september 1999			1
a record level of surveyors also predicted sales will pick up in the coming months			2
however , @entity11 warned that without a ' meaningful increase ' in the supply of homes , both house prices and rents will become more unaffordable			1
the @entity11 said 59 per cent of surveyors forecast price rises over the next three months it said the reading for the number of surveyors predicting price rises rather than falls is the highest since september 1999 and demonstrates the impact that the recovery is having on an ' anaemic supply ' of properties for sale in the housing market			1
in what @entity11 said is a ' sharp ' pick - up , a balance of 58 per cent more surveyors also reported already seeing house price growth last month			1
for the second month in a row , each region of the @entity38 saw prices rise			0
@entity42 sales have also lifted strongly compared with a year ago			0
an average of just over 20 homes per surveyor were sold in the three months to november , compared with around 15 during the same period last year			2
the housing market has been showing strong signs of recovery throughout 2013 following a string of @entity51 schemes such as help to buy and @entity53 for lending which have widened mortgage availability and fuelled demand from buyers			0
a new phase of the government 's flagship help to buy scheme was launched in october to give more people with low deposits a helping hand on to or up the housing ladder			0
the institution warned that without a ' meaningful increase ' in the supply of homes then rents and prices would become more unaffordable the scheme offers state - backed loans to people with deposits as low as 5 per cent and lenders representing around two - thirds of the mortgage market have confirmed they will take part			1
but experts have said that stronger efforts must also be made to increase the number of homes on the market , with the mismatch between supply and demand putting an upward pressure on prices			2
last week , @entity87 reported that house prices rose by 7.7 per cent in november , marking the highest increase seen in six years			1
in his @entity91 last week , chancellor @entity90 announced Â£ 1billion of loans to unblock large housing developments , including in @entity94 and @entity95 , and raising a borrowing limit for councils to fund new homes			0
@entity87 reported that house prices rose by 7.7 per cent in november , marking the highest increase seen in six years but housing charity shelter called for ' bolder ideas ' for more affordable homes to be built			1
@entity102 , @entity11 chief economist , said : ' it 's no secret that the housing market is on the way up and prices are surging ahead in many parts of the country			2
' he continued : ' as the chancellor pointed out last week , housebuilding is on the up , but it is rising nowhere near quickly enough to make up the shortfall that has built up in recent years			0
' if there is not a meaningful increase in new homes , the likelihood is that prices , and for that matter rents , will continue to push upwards , making the cost of shelter ever more unaffordable			1
' the @entity123 scheme which has been credited with boosting mortgage availability generally is being re-directed away from households to help small businesses			0
the number of mortgages on the market has increased by around 40 per cent since @entity130 was launched last year			0
mr @entity90 also announced last week that @entity132 residents will have to pay capital gains tax ( @entity134 ) on property sales from april 2015			0
this is expected to take some of the heat out of the @entity139 housing market as strong house price growth in the @entity142 capital has been put down in part to overseas investors looking for a safe haven to place their cash .			0
