@entity1 's largest anti-sexual assault organization is slamming @entity2 and @entity3 for what they are calling a ' dangerous ' new music video			1
the video , for the group 's new single , @entity6 , follows @entity3 , 35 , as he stalks , unknowingly photographs and ultimately sexually assaults a woman as the two are covered in blood			1
the woman is played by none other than @entity3 's real - life wife , @entity17 - born @entity19 model @entity18			1
' the trivialization of these serious crimes , like stalking , should have no place in the entertainment industry			0
' @entity38 , an acronym for @entity38 , is an organization best known for operating the @entity38 and carrying out programs to prevent sexual assault , help victims , and ensure that rapists are brought to justice			2
dapper dude : @entity3 has yet to comment on the controversy trouble : the @entity38 called the music video ' dangerous ' creep : @entity3 follows the woman the entire video in the video , @entity3 , 35 , plays a butcher who develops an unhealthy obsession with a female customer , played by @entity18			1
he follows her in the streets , photographs her , breaks into her home and then lies in bed with the woman as she sleeps			0
this then culminates with the two having sex in a fantasy sequence as they are both covered in blood			0
more trouble : the @entity78 also slammed the video , saying @entity3 treats the woman like a piece of meat also quiet : @entity18 has also declined to comment on the controversy unknowing victim : prinsloo , playing the woman , is unaware she is being followed in the video and @entity38 is not alone in voicing their concern with the message this video sends , as the @entity78 is also taking @entity3 to task for treating the woman in the video like a piece of meat , this according to @entity95			2
oddly enough , neither organization made any mention of the song 's lyrics , which includes lines like , ' baby , i 'm preying on you tonight / @entity97 you down eat you alive , ' and ' maybe you think that you can hide / i can smell your scent from miles / just like animals			0
' neither @entity3 or @entity18 have commented on the controversy			2
