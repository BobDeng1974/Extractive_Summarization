by @entity0 , mail online deputy political editor @entity3 's rising star @entity2 has declared that he has no problem with people making ' a lot of money '			1
the shadow business secretary , tipped as a future party leader , even said @entity3 wanted to help people become millionaires			1
mr @entity2 's remarks echo former cabinet minister @entity12 - who famously said that @entity3 under @entity13 was ' intensely relaxed about people getting filthy rich '			1
@entity2 , tipped as a future prime minister , is known to speak regularly with @entity16 heavyweight @entity12 mr @entity13 himself said he did not go into politics ' to make sure that @entity19 earns less money '			1
mr @entity2 's remarks appear in stark contrast to those of @entity3 leader @entity23 - who has vowed to create a more equal society			1
but the @entity3 frontbencher told @entity26 : ' i do n’t have a problem with people making a lot of money , so long as they pay their taxes and it ’s good for our economy			1
' he added : ' i ’m very clear : we want to help people make their first million			2
@entity12 , the former business secretary , is now a @entity3 peer			1
he was a key member of the new @entity3 government ' if you set up a start - up and you increase you turnover to over a million , you will be employing people and delivering tax receipts to the @entity44 and helping @entity45 pay its way in the world			1
we should be saying that			2
' mr @entity2 also praised new treasury minister @entity50 's successful career in banking			0
he said : ' i do n’t have a problem with the fact that @entity50 earned millions of pounds working in the @entity55 before he was elected			0
' i have more of a problem with what he stands for and what he believes in and that ’s what the focus should be			0
' the intervention comes after mr @entity23 earlier this year said ' tackling inequality is the new centre ground of politics '			0
after winning the @entity3 leadership in 2010 he said equality was ' at the very heart of why we need to move on from @entity3 '			1
he said : ' during our years in power , we did n't do enough to stop the gap between rich and poor getting wider			2
' but mr @entity2 launched an impassioned defence of mr @entity13 's record			0
the @entity3 mp said : ' we achieved a huge amount in office , and we should shout more loudly about it			1
' we all know what the @entity80 strategy will be , and that will be to argue that @entity3 crashed the car			1
' well , that is not the experience of my constituents when they look at the six new and improved health centres in @entity89 , when they look at our safer neighbourhood teams in every ward , when they look at improved school buildings , reduced class sizes and the increased numbers of young people going to university for the first time in their family ’s history			2
' do n’t tell me we crashed the car , because we left this country in an immeasurably better state in 2010 than we found it in 1997 and @entity13 has a huge amount to do with that			0
' labour leader @entity23 and his shadow business secretary are close allies like mr @entity13 , the shadow business secretary is religious			1
mr @entity2 said : ' my faith has definitely shaped my politics			0
' i do try to go to @entity113 [ @entity114 ] at least once a month , and get a bit of time away to reflect			0
i would n’t say i ’m majorly religious			0
but i am a believer , absolutely			0
' mr @entity2 also revealed his inspiration for joining the @entity119 - former @entity118 chancellor @entity117			2
the @entity3 mp , who attended the private @entity121 school in south @entity122 , challenged mr @entity117 when he came to give a speech			1
he said : ' he got up and made the case for the @entity118 and said why we should support them			0
' and i sat in my chair getting more and more agitated by what he was saying , so got up to ask a question , slightly forgetting that this man used to run the @entity45 economy and here i am this 17 year - old challenging him			1
' i said " how on earth can you expect us to vote for you when you said you were going to cut taxes and you ’ve actually put them up ? and you ’re jailing female prisoners who are in labour			2
’ “ and of course the reaction in the hall was electric			0
people were laughing and clapping			2
' and i finished asking the question , and was slightly shaking , going " i ca n’t quite believe i ’ve just done that "			0
' and i always remember @entity117 said " are you quite finished yet ? " - and i carried on			2
' i sat down thinking " i ca n’t believe i ’ve done this "			0
' and that was the first time i thought maybe i could do politics at some point in the future			0
