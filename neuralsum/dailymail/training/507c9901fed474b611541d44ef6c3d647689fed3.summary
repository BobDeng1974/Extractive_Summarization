@entity0 has declared a desire to keep both @entity2 and @entity3 at @entity4 this season even though he accepts he will soon have to make one of them extremely unhappy			1
the @entity4 manager watched @entity3 make an impressive return from a serious shoulder injury in a pre-season friendly here against @entity11 after young @entity13 striker @entity12 cancelled out @entity15 ’s opener for the hosts			1
but @entity3 faces a serious threat to his place for the first time in a decade at @entity20 , with @entity2 the favourite to start against @entity22 in @entity4 ’s @entity24 opener on august 18			1
