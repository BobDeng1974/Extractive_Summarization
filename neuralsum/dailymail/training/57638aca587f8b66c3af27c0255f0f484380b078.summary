@entity5 , right , had been ' on @entity11 ' after giving birth to triplets but she died just eight days after their birth			1
her husband @entity3 is pictured left the sudden loss has understandably left her husband distraught			2
mr @entity20 said his wife – whose funeral is today – had been ‘ over the moon ’ after giving birth to @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26 and he described his family ’s week together as ‘ precious ’			1
‘ we were both overjoyed to be having an instant family , ’ he said			2
‘ the triplets were our first and most probably last children			0
‘ we looked forward to sharing and introducing our children to our shared hobbies of family time around the kitchen table , playing guitar , country walks , camping , motorbiking , listening to the rain and watching the world go by			0
’ instead , his 34 - year - old wife collapsed and was taken to the @entity44 – the same hospital in which she gave birth			1
she died there on march 10			2
@entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26 , pictured , will now be brought up without their @entity49 - born mother mrs @entity5 is believed to have possibly died from haemopericardium , where blood leaks into the sac surrounding the heart from a cut in an artery			1

we would like to thank all of our friends and colleagues who have been in touch as these words of comfort and kindness mean so much			0

‘ things to do with the house , to look out for @entity5 , to communicate on email and social media , for work , arrange stuff , order the pram , photos to upload and send to relatives and friends , small stuff that we have experienced and other relevant minutiae that we should capture before it is lost in the ticker tape of life			2
’ the @entity44 where @entity5 gave birth to triplets but died just over a week later yesterday , his wife ’s profile on @entity142 still described her as ‘ in love ; pregnant with triplets ; smiling ; philosophical and relaxed whenever possible ’			1
