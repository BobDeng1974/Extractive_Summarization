this is the touching moment a doting dad dances with his daughter at home			2
but the dance party for @entity5 , 5 , was arranged by her dad , @entity6 , 42 , at their @entity8 home because she has the @entity11 virus and the family are under a self - imposed quarantine			1
the five - year - old suffers from a rare and ultimately fatal genetic condition called @entity16 and has to avoid interacting with people 's germs or it could kill her			1
if she built up immunity to this virus she would likely not qualify for a clinical trial , as @entity11 will deliver the medicine in the body			2
this is her only chance at life			0
her family have put themselves under a voluntary quarantine for the past nine months in a bid to avoid interacting with other people			1
the family has chosen to avoid interacting with people and anything people have touched			2
it means mom @entity28 , dad @entity6 and brother @entity29 , 8 , stay at home with her 24 hours a day and seven days a week to protect her			2
her mom , @entity28 quit her job as a pediatrician while @entity6 works remotely as a consultant at @entity57 and @entity29 can no longer attend his school , instead doing his schoolwork remotely			0
the family get their groceries delivered and on the rare occasion they do have to interact with people , they wear masks and gloves			1
they only leave their house once a week to go to an empty beach or field , where the kids can run free			0
since @entity5 was diagnosed with the illness in july 2013 , the family have raised $ 2.2 million with a @entity75 page and other traditional fundraising efforts in the hope to help her survive			1
her father @entity6 told people : ' we heard that there was a clinical trial that might cure @entity5 of this disease			1
so of course we knew that we had to raise every dollar that they needed for it			0
' but since reaching their goal in december 2014 , they have experienced delays with the trials due to difficulties in drug production			0
and even when the medicine is ready , they do n't know if @entity5 will be picked for the trial			1
' this is our only chance , ' @entity6 says			0
' not only for @entity5 , but other children with @entity16			1
' support : @entity28 , right , dances with her husband , @entity6 as their daughter @entity5 , left , reads a book quarantine : @entity107 's daddy / daughter dance came after she missed a @entity109 - themed dance at her school isolated : her mom , @entity28 , left , quit her job as a pediatrician while dad @entity6 works remotely as a consultant at @entity57 @entity107 's daddy / daughter dance came after she missed a @entity109 - themed dance at her school			1
it took a lot of planning because the family needed to make sure that @entity5 did not catch any incoming diseases			1
her father writes in a @entity123 video : ' every little girl deserves to go to a special dance			0
' the disorder means that the pretty girl with blonde pigtails will slowly lose her ability to speak and by the age of six will most likely not be able to talk at all , according to people			2
by the time she turns ten - years - old , she is expected to be in a wheelchair and need constant care			0
the family are choosing to stay under quarantine because other parents who have children with @entity16 warn that if children get sick it could accelerate their @entity16 symptoms			1
@entity6 said : ' this is a personal decision that we made			0
doctors understand why we 're doing this but they did n't tell us we had to			0
' ' i ca n't say if looking back one day i would regret anything we have done for @entity150			0
we constantly make sure we both still agree that this is the right move			0
