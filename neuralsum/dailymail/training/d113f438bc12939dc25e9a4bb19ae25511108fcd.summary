two ex-british soldiers who travelled to @entity1 to fight against @entity2 have had panic alarms fitted to their homes upon their return for fear of reprisals from extremists			1
@entity10 and @entity11 revealed the heightened security around them since their return in their first television interview , in which they described the battleground in the war - torn country as ' like @entity19 '			1
mr @entity10 , 24 , from @entity20 , had previously said his motivation for travelling to fight was the murder of aid volunteer @entity24			1
' i could not justify sitting back in the @entity27 and watching is pretty much do what they like , ' he told @entity38			2
upon their return they were detained at @entity42 and questioned for six hours , although they were not arrested and were released before their homes were placed under monitoring by counter-terror police			2
mr @entity10 , who had a brief stint in the @entity51 , the @entity49 's regiment , said : ' the counter-terrorism police have got our houses red - flagged in the sense of if any calls come out from that area they will be straight to our house			0
we have got panic alarms fitted in both our houses now			0
' mr @entity11 , who served three tours of @entity62 with the @entity63 , added : ' there 's patrols purposely put out in case of said event would happen			0
' on their arrest , mr @entity10 said they knew there was a risk but he felt their mission was a ' humanitarian effort ' and the pair also again denied claims they were ' mercenaries ' , saying they had come back to ' a lot of debt '			0
in the pair 's first tv interview , mr @entity10 ( pictured , right and left ) said there are fears that his or mr @entity11 may be attacked in the @entity27 and their homes are being watched by the security services the pair also revealed they had resolved to take their own lives if they felt they could be captured by the militants , who were battling @entity28 forces to take control of the @entity1 border town of @entity96			1
' if at any one point we honestly , genuinely felt they were coming coming for us , ' it 's definitely over ' , if we had rounds on us , if we had weapons on us then keep one for yourself , ' mr @entity10 said			0
' nobody wants to get captured by @entity105 , nobody wants to end up on @entity107 getting their head cut off			0
as harsh as it sounds , it 's probably the better way to go			0
' on the other side of the battle lines , official figures suggest more than 500 @entity27 have travelled to fight for @entity3 in @entity1 and @entity115			1
at the time the men went to fight , the @entity116 warned against all travel to the country , saying anyone who did so was putting themselves in ' considerable danger '			0
mr @entity11 ( left ) and mr read ( right ) were among a band of foreigners who have joined the @entity28			2
they said the battlefield they found was ' like @entity19 ' taxi driver mr @entity24 , 47 , was killed by a masked militant known as @entity129 in a video released online in october following a string of similarly publicised killings			1
@entity3 has also posted a series of videos online showing the separate murders of @entity138 journalists @entity136 and @entity139 , @entity138 aid worker @entity140 and @entity27 aid worker @entity141			1
footage appearing to show mr @entity24 's murder appeared on the internet days after the @entity27 joined @entity138 - led air strikes against the terrorists in @entity115			1
a @entity116 spokesman said : ' the @entity27 advises against all travel to @entity1 and parts of @entity115			2
anyone who does travel to these areas , even for humanitarian reasons , is putting themselves in considerable danger of harm			0
' the best way for the public to help is to donate to or otherwise support @entity27 - registered charities that have ongoing relief operations			2

former servicemen went to fight after seeing @entity24 murder by @entity3
they say they could not stand by and watch *innocent* *people* being killed
*ex-soldiers* joined other fighters from @entity138 and @entity169 *alongside* the @entity28
the pair say battlefield *references* to ' @entity173 ' *reminded* them of @entity19
they were questioned at border as they tried to return home for @entity179
the pair , aged 24 and 26 , say they now fear reprisals from @entity27 *radicals*
