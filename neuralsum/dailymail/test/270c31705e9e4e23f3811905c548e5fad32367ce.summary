modern humans have developed a reputation for being somewhat destructive and keen to separate themselves from the rest of the animal kingdom			0
however , a recent excavation of a cave in the foothills of the @entity8 in @entity9 is suggesting our ancient cousins , the @entity12 , were more in tune with nature			1
archaeologists have discovered evidence that @entity12 regularly inhabited the @entity17 , near @entity18 in @entity19 , around 200,000 years ago but were not alone			1
the fossilised remains of badgers were found in old dens within the cave alongside @entity12 camps the remains of other canivores including cave bears , hyenas , leopards , wolves and badgers have been found in the cave and were apparently also living there			1
while some of the bones may have been brought there by the @entity12 themselves , it seems they were also sharing the cave with these other predators			1
scratches on the walls and hibernations nests particularly indicate that cave bears spent a considerable amount of time there			2
neanderthals , shown in the artist 's impression above , may have lived alongside predators in a cave in @entity9 researchers found several cave bear fossils , similar to the one above , along with scratches on the walls and signs of hibernation nests that suggest they were living in the cave alongside @entity12 200,000 years ago it is hoped the discoveries will help scientists learn more about @entity12 behaviour and their relationship with the animals they co-existed with			1
‘ the excavations have documented regular visits by groups @entity12 , probably related to hunting animals living around the cave			0
’ the researchers discovered large numbers of stone tools made by @entity12 and evidence of camps that were made close to the entrance of the cave			1
they also found the fossilised bones of @entity71 tahr – a species of wild sheep that became extinct in western @entity74 100,000 years ago – which appear to have been hunted by the @entity12			1
the researchers also found traces of other ungulates including deer , rhinos and megaloceros - a giant species of deer that is now extinct			0
neanderthals first emerged around 280,000 years ago , spreading to inhabit much of @entity74 and parts of @entity85 , but they eventually died out 40,000 years ago			2
the reason for their demise was often put down to being a more primative species of human that was unable to compete against the more sophisticated homo sapiens			0
they were depicted as thuggish cavemen that scraped an existence on the cold lands of ice age @entity74			0
however , a series of discoveries are now putting @entity12 into a new light			0
stone tools discovered at sites they inhabited suggest they were skilled tool makers with adept hand eye coordination			2
a 60,000 - year - old multi-purpose bone tool unearthed in @entity105 also suggests @entity12 understood how to use bones to make useful devices a recent discovery by researchers at the @entity110 in @entity111 suggests that @entity12 may have built homes using the materials they found around them			1
they discovered a 26 feet wide building created 44,000 years ago from mammoth bones			1
many of the bones had also been decorated carvings and ochre pigments			0
cross-hatched engravings found inside @entity121 in @entity122 are also thought to be the first known examples of @entity12 rock art. dna analysis has also shown that @entity12 carried the same genes that are thought to have enabled modern humans to speak			0
eight talons found at a 130,000 year old @entity12 site in @entity130 in @entity131 are also thought to be the world 's first jewellery , and may have been worn as a necklace			2
recent research has also suggested that @entity12 may also have used herbs to flavour their food			0
neanderthals , like the one above , may well have been the world 's first gourmet chefs and made jewellery			0

fossils found in @entity144 in @entity19 , @entity9 suggests @entity12 lived alongside other predators like badgers , bears , wolves and leopards
large quantities of stone tools were found in ' camps ' at the cave entrance
bones of sheep , deer and rhino that @entity12 's hunted were also found
several *carnivores* used the cave as a den at the time 200,000 years ago
