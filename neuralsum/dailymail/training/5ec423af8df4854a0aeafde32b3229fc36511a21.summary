mrs @entity2 , 42 , said : ' they are very much a part of the family			1
the kids joke that the camels get treated better than they do			2
' we love them as if they were extra members of the family			2
' our local pub even has a sign that reads ' dogs and camels welcome '			0
thirsty work : the @entity2 's have a drink with their camels at @entity56 in the nearby town of @entity58 on @entity59 , @entity38 affinity : mr @entity61 , who was raised in a circus family , has always had a long - standing connection with the towering mammals , which can grow to seven feet tall and weigh 2,000lbs ' they can be very high maintenance and take an awful lot of care , but the similarities between them and domestic animals are plentiful			1
' they prove to be great company and are very affectionate			0

' but the camels are priceless - i would n't swap them for all the tea in @entity118			0

and parents at the school gate are used to seeing @entity10 pick up her kids astride the towering mammals several times a year			2
mrs @entity2 has even occasionally shunned the family car for their more environmentally friendly transport - that runs on oats and grass - to pick up the groceries			1
mrs @entity2 added : ' we go out in public with them once or twice a week - sometimes for a trek			1
' obviously people are surprised - it is not every day you see camels strolling down the road			0
they do look out of place			0
reaction : mrs @entity2 added : ' we go out in public with them once or twice a week - sometimes for a trek			1
people love seeing them ' camel chauffeurs : mrs @entity2 runs an errand in the town while her husband holds on to the reins ' we get comments all the time about how mild - mannered they are and how they smell so clean			1
they have a bit of a bad reputation but it is very undeserved			0
' the camels are very good around people			0
people think they are grumpy and spit all the time but that could n't be further from the truth			0
' they are in fact incredibly nosy and rush to the garden gates to have a look whenever anyone goes past , so they enjoy being out and about and interacting with people			0
' mr @entity61 continued : ' they love the beach , they think it is great			0
' as soon as they get the sand between their toes you can see they instantly feel at home			0
' the sea slightly puzzles them			0
we have n't been for a while because of the weather but if the summer is nice maybe we will get the chance to take them down there for a day			0
' it costs the couple thousands of pounds each year in upkeep - including hay for the stables purposefully built in their garden			1
part of the family : the couple with @entity16 , @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity203 expensive : they get through 400 bales of hay a year , thousands of gallons of water and feed them on a diet of sugar beat , barley and oats pricey pets : incredibly , such is the value of the @entity13 's only camel herd , the pair have public liability insurance totalling a staggering £ 5 million here to stay : mr @entity61 said : ' they are n't the cheapest pets that 's for sure , but we would n't change it for a thing ' they get through 400 bales of hay a year , thousands of gallons of water and feed them on a diet of sugar beat , barley and oats			1
and as a treat , the camels will be served freshly picked strawberries			0
mr @entity61 said : ' they are n't the cheapest pets that 's for sure , but we would n't change it for a thing			2
' it is hard to pinpoint exactly how much we spend as there are lots of hidden costs like grooming and the upkeep of the stables but it costs thousands each year			1
' they are high maintenance and you need to know how to care for them properly			0
i would n't recommend them as a pet unless you have many acres of land and a great knowledge of their needs			0
' after hand rearing two of the latest additions to the herd - @entity22 and @entity19 - the pair decided to cash in on their unique pets , setting up a company , @entity11 's @entity264			2
