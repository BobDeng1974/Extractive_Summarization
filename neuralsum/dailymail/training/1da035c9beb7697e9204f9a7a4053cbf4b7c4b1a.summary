a make - up artist has defied traditional beauty conventions by trading in his usual array of cosmetics in favor of a variety of everyday objects which he has used to transform the faces of his models			1
@entity12 ambassador @entity11 , who has previously worked with the likes of @entity14 and @entity15 , teamed up with @entity17 fashion photographer @entity16 in order to showcase the unique beauty looks , which make use of everything from string and paint to acrylic and even uv light			1
' i 'm always interested to see what you can decorate a face with , rather than just lipstick , powder , and pencils , ' @entity11 told @entity33			2
' i really wanted to do a makeup shoot on boys that was n’t drag , but it also was n’t just messy , ' he said of one shoot			2
' we did one quite early on for @entity46 , and i wanted it to be about light and how light reacts to things			0
' i wanted him to look kind of like @entity63			0
' so , i airbrushed the majority of the face in uv paint , but we shot it with a uv light so it has this extra dimension of crazy			0
' finding inspiration : @entity11 's work is influenced by all manner of things , from art exhibitions to the environment @entity76 : the images also incorporate movement in order to offer added impact when it comes to finding new and innovative beauty looks , @entity11 is n't short of ideas - and admits he has found inspiration in all manner of locations			1
' [ i went ] to an exhibition at the @entity89 in @entity90 , and i ’d seen a sculpture with all these stringed pieces , ' he says about one particular shoot			0
' i loved the shadow they cast ... i [ wanted to ] do that on a face and in color			0
so , we pulled some references on how a stained - glass window casts a colorful shadow			2
' i thought about using photography gels for a similar effect , and we did a few different versions of that			0
clowning around : the photographs were taken over a number of years and have been brought together for the first time in @entity16 's new book entitled @entity11 another perspective : @entity11 enjoys ' decorating ' faces , rather than just making them up with traditional beauty products [ the model was ] painted white to get rid of the features , and then the gels were stuck on in a way that you get the proper effect			1
' after years of collaborating together , @entity16 and @entity121 have now released a book which showcases the very best of their joint projects			1
entitled @entity11 by @entity16 , the artistic tome includes dozens of images of the make - up artist 's most out - there beauty looks which @entity16 sums up in one succinct sentence : ' you name it , we stuck it on them .			1
