by @entity0 published : 19:18 est , 31 july 2013 updated : 01:45 est , 1 august 2013 @entity2 ’s hair became the top talent on @entity5 ’s @entity4 on tuesday night after the star judge appeared on the show apparently wearing a wig			1
the 41 - year - old singer ’s signature short hair style had been ‘ replaced ’ by flowing dark locks			0
the new look sent social media buzzing , with many of her fans speculating she was wearing a hair piece and ruling out hair extentions , with one writer commenting : ‘ you have such beautiful hair			2
why go the wig ? ’ spot the difference : @entity2 was spotted with short hair when arriving at @entity25 , but when she appeared on the x-factor she appeared to be sporting a wig @entity29 style commentator @entity28 said @entity2 - the sister of pop diva @entity30 - was ‘ on trend ’ , with wigs becoming a staple for many celebrities			2
@entity35 and @entity36 perfected the art of wearing wigs , while more recently by @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42 have donned a fashionable hair piece			0
‘ i think it is fantastic that a style - oriented and savvy woman like @entity2 can wear a wig and make it look cool , ' wrote @entity28			0
‘ it ’s usually got nothing to do with a personal hair issue or bad hair situation it ’s more like a great way of giving a celeb a new look with the help of a great hair stylist in the space of a few minutes			0
' she added : ‘ if it is a good quality wig - some even feature “ roots ” so they look even more authentic - and it suits your face shape , then why not take the easier option ? stylish : fashionista @entity41 has helped make wigs popular with her outrageous sense of style			0
@entity35 ( left ) is also said to be a fan of the hairpiece it ’s not the first time @entity2 has been seen with long hair			1
she appeared in promotional shots for the show in april with a similar full length style - just over a week after she had been seen on a @entity81 beach with much shorter hair			1
that short style was still in evidence when she arrived in @entity5 later that month with her cropped hair peeking out from underneath a bowler hat at @entity25 airport			0
then fans , who had seen those arrival pictures followed by the promotional shots showing @entity2 ’s long locks , were left in no doubt she had taken to a wearing a toupee - no - one could have grown hair that quickly			1
the wig and the gown mum - of - one @entity2 wore for the promotional shots left fans in no doubt that the @entity4 - as seen on tv on tuesday evening - was not live , but had been recorded three months earlier .			1
