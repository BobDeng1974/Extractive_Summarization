by @entity1 reporter published : 10:32 est , 11 january 2013 updated : 10:32 est , 11 january 2013 when @entity3 and @entity4 got a call from a local shelter saying their beloved dog , @entity9 , was found safe , they were overjoyed			1
the dog had run off from their @entity13 , @entity12 property a few days earlier during a thunderstorm in 2009			1
but when mr @entity17 went to the pound with their two young children , they received the heartbreaking news - @entity9 had been mistakenly euthanized			0
best friend : @entity9 was a beloved member of the @entity17 family before being accidentally euthanized one of the family : @entity17 and wife @entity4 share a hug with @entity9 ' they were told they accidentally killed him the day before , " @entity17 's attorney , @entity28 , told @entity29			1
the shelter , @entity31 , had properly labeled @entity9 's cage as ' hold for owner ' but a worker there still put the mixed - breed dog down			1
' she went through and picked the dogs that needed to be euthanized and accidentally picked @entity9 , ' said @entity28			0
that 's when the family decided to bring its lawsuit , charging negligence against the shelter and the worker , @entity44			2
@entity12 state law includes a 1963 rule that allows people to sue for the sentimental value of property even if there is no monetary value on the open market			2
the rule has previously been applied to irreplaceable photographs or family heirlooms , but never to a family pet			0
ms @entity44 's lawyer , @entity57 , said she instantly felt terrible after learning about her tragic mistake			0
" ms. @entity44 , from day one , has been devastated by the unfortunate accident that occurred that led to @entity9 's death , " @entity57 said			2
during thursday 's argument before the @entity64 , a lawyer representing the shelter said it was impossible to assign value to a pet			1
" my dog may be worth $ 1 million to me â€” should that much money go to an owner for pain and suffering ? " asked @entity68 , the general counsel of the @entity69 , according to the @entity70			0
a decision in the case is not expected for several weeks .			0

shelter called @entity12 family to say their *runaway* dog , @entity9 , had been found safely and was waiting for them
when family went to *retrieve* their beloved pooch they learned of the *horrifying* mistake
@entity89 sued for dog 's sentimental value and the case , the first of its kind , is now before the @entity64
