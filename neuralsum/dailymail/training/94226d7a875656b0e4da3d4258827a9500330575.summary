votes from the shareholders were still being counted but the company said a proposal from the @entity50 to force the company 's chairman to be an independent director had failed			1

few held out any hope they could overcome @entity1 's control of 40 percent of voting shares through a family trust , or the seven per cent stake @entity106 prince @entity105 has almost certainly cast in support of him			2
@entity108 , an @entity110 shareholder and long - time critic of @entity1 , said it was an ' extraordinarily paranoid " meeting			2
