her condition is so severe that she has shrunk an inch and a half in the last two years - dropping from 5ft 5½in to just 5ft 4in			1
the rare agonising condition , which weakens the collagen in her body , means that the former make - up artist spends most of the day confined to her bed			1

' through the campaign some amazing companies and people have come forward to help and i say a huge ' thank you ' to them all			2
she told how she has lost her home , business and partner because of the illness , which leaves her in constant pain			2
' the long - term prognosis is deterioration resulting in seizures drop attacks and eventually paralysis			1
' the smallest journey is living hell , inflicting vibration and jarring to my body , so even hospital appointments are huge pain filled ordeals			2
' ' i wear a cervical collar a large proportion of the time to enforce restricted movements			2
sudden movement and over stressing my ligaments and joints could be catastrophic			2
@entity0 suffers from @entity9 , which is so severe she spends most of the day confined to her bed @entity0 pictured with her parents @entity58 and @entity60 at their home in @entity30 ' as a young confident woman in her twenties , i had built a successful beauty business that was going from strength to strength			1
' but i was unable to sustain the rigorous demands required to run a business and had to let it go			2
' this in turn also meant the loss of my home and my livelihood			0
' i was engaged for two years but the relationship also succumbed to the stress and demands of my illness and we separated			0
' i am now all but housebound and live with my hugely supportive parents			0
miss @entity0 believes that the surgery is her ' last and only chance ' ' even within a home environment it is almost impossible to undertake or do day - to - day tasks most of us take for granted			1
' this is due to almost 24 hour pain , severe migraines , neurological problems , not being able to focus or move my eyes , numbness , weakness , pain that radiates from behinds my eyes and the back of the skull , from my neck into my shoulders and arms and further down my spine			1
' to compound the problem , my solace from pain relief is compromised as i have an allergic reaction to morphine and many opiates			0
my body is slowly closing down and many of my waking hours i am confined to my bed			1
' @entity9 affects one in 5,000 people in the @entity111 and renders itself very differently in each individual			1
' despite not knowing for years , i was actually born with @entity9 and lived with it my entire life			1
' it meant for many of my early years i would bruise very easily , suffer dislocations and other injures that , at the time , went unexplained			0
' it was when i hit the age of 23 that serious problems started to manifest and knew that i would have to seek out help and advice from doctors and consultants			0
' however , my diagnosis was very vague and put my problems down to a range of issues from anxiety to psychological issues			0
' i was offered counselling and anti-depressants at the time but knew that this would not solve the problem			0
' i carried on as i was until i was around 26 when the situation became quite serious and i began to suffer from quite serious sickness and nausea			0
' my weight dropped dramatically and my hair began to fall out as i could no longer eat solid food			0
@entity9 ( @entity9 ) is a collection of inherited conditions , known as heritable disorders of connective tissue			1
connective tissues provide support in skin , tendons , ligaments , blood vessels , internal organs and bones			0
there are different types of @entity9 , which can cause : the fragile skin and unstable joints may be the result of faulty collagen			1
collagen is a protein in connective tissue that acts as a ' glue ' in the body , adding strength and elasticity			1
the different types of @entity9 are caused by alterations in certain genes that make collagen weaker			1
in some cases the amount of collagen in the body is reduced			2
the faulty genes can be passed from parents to their children			0
source : @entity178 ' then , soon after , issues started to emerge regarding my movement , vision and then vertigo set in			0

i also had major damage to ligaments and bones , ' she added			0
' i started to suffer excruciating migraines and constant headaches that have not stopped since			0
' this was when i was formally diagnosed with @entity202 lust for life has drained from me			0
' miss @entity0 was left shell shocked by the diagnoses and pain and suffering that came with it but she was defiant that she would beat this problem , only to learn that salvation would be hard to come by			1
the nature of @entity9 frequently leads to other related illnesses such as @entity212 ( @entity212 ) and @entity213 ( @entity214 )			1
' @entity214 manifestations are complex , it is often described as ' pumpkin on a tooth pick syndrome , ' she said			0
' put simply , my ligaments do not support my spine , my spine moves , my head slides and wobbles and my brainstem is stretched and compressed and is causing catastrophic damage to my body			2
' each movement i make causes more and more damage , resulting in more impairment and generating more disabilities			0
i am constantly bed ridden and i am in so much pain			0
' the surgery @entity28 is due to undergo in the @entity2 is major and there are risks attached , but it has a 95 per cent success rate			1
