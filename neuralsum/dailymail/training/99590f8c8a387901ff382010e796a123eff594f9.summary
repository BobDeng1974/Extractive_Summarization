by @entity0 a black performing arts high school student falsely arrested by three white officers has been awarded $ 119,000 in damages			1
@entity6 officers @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9 had also been accused of beating 22 - year - old @entity10 , but a jury found they did not use excessive force			1
the split verdict by the all - white jury of four men and four women had attorneys for @entity10 and the officers claiming victory , with neither side completely satisfied			1
@entity10 ' attorney , @entity28 , said he was gratified but did not understand how the jurors decided on the damages or concluded police were wrong to arrest @entity10 but not to beat him			1
' the only thing he wanted to hear was that these officers did the wrong thing , ' @entity28 said of @entity10 , ' and he heard that in the courtroom today			2
' @entity36 , the attorney for @entity9 - who has since left the city police force to work in the suburbs - said the verdict ' makes no sense			0
' jurors leaving the courthouse declined to comment , leaving unclear how they viewed the conflicting accounts of what happened on the night of the incident			0
@entity10 had claimed the officers confronted him on the night of january 12 , 2010 , while he was walking to his grandmother 's house to spend the night			1
he said he was talking on his mobile phone when the plainclothes officers pulled up in an unmarked car asking for money , drugs and a gun without identifying themselves			0
@entity10 's lawyers argued the ' jump out ' tactic , which police denied using , is designed to catch suspected drug dealers off - guard			2
the officers maintain they flashed their badges and yelled ' police ! ' and stopped @entity10 only because he appeared to be lurking near a neighbour 's home			1
they claim @entity10 panicked and ran after being asked why he was ' sneaking around '			0
they say the confrontation escalated when @entity10 elbowed @entity8 in the head and kicked @entity7 in the knee			0
the officers say they then mistook a ' bulge ' in @entity10 ' coat pocket for a gun			2
the officers acknowledge kneeing and punching @entity10 to subdue him before determining the bulge was a bottle of @entity75			2
@entity10 denies even carrying the bottle , which officers said they threw away because it was not evidence of the prowling , assault and resisting arrest charges they filed against @entity10			2
a city magistrate did not find the police version credible and dismissed those charges weeks later			0
@entity7 's attorney , @entity86 , believes that is why the jury found the officers wrongly arrested @entity10			1
' clearly this is a compromise verdict , ' @entity86 said			0
' all along the excessive force is what we were worried about			1
' @entity10 ' attorney wants the @entity95 and @entity96 to reconsider a decision not to prosecute the officers criminally			1
@entity100 attorney @entity99 did not immediately comment			0
but @entity36 said the verdict proves the @entity96 was right not to prosecute the officers â € ” especially because the burden of proof in a criminal case is even higher than in @entity10 ' lawsuit			1
meanwhile , @entity86 and @entity8 's attorney , @entity108 , said the monetary damages are not a clear victory for @entity10			1
@entity10 ' attorneys previously demanded $ 2 million to settle the case and rejected the city 's offer of $ 180,000			2
the city , instead , paid $ 75,000 to settle @entity10 ' claims against the government itself , with the understanding that money would be deducted from any damages award against the officers			0
because more than $ 41,000 of the verdict was covered by city insurance , the city 's $ 75,000 could be deducted from the remaining $ 78,000 â € ” leaving @entity10 with a net award of $ 3,000 , @entity86 and @entity108 said			0
and @entity10 could still wind up paying some of the officers ' attorneys ' fees because he did not win the case outright			0
@entity28 said he was still researching those claims and could not immediately comment , but @entity86 said , ' eventually , @entity10 may well be writing the @entity132 of @entity6 a check in this case			0

@entity10 said he was confronted while walking to grandmother 's house
jury found officers falsely arrested him , but did not use excessive force
