by @entity0 scientists have proved that the sky is certainly not the limit for the internet , by showing it could be possible to get broadband on the moon			1
a team of researchers from the @entity10 ’s ( @entity10 ) @entity11 demonstrated for the first time that a the technology exists to provide space dwellers with the connectivity we all enjoy here on @entity18			1
it could allow large data transfers and even high - definition video streaming			1
scientists at @entity10 say they have devised a way to transfer large amounts of data quickly and easily across the vast expanse of space			1
this could provide future astronauts with a ' broadband network ' on the moon			1
this is a computer - aided design drawing of the optical module on the satellite showing the telescope and gimbal ( pivoted support ) the team has been conducting tests transferring data from the earth to the moon , with specialist laser - based communication equipment			1
a ground terminal at @entity45 , @entity46 , uses four separate telescopes to send the uplink signal to the moon			0
each telescope is about six inches ( 15 centimetres ) in diameter and fed by a laser transmitter that sends information coded as pulses of invisible infrared light			2
the reason for the four telescopes is that each one transmits light through a different column of air that experiences different bending effects from the atmosphere , @entity56 said			0
this increases the chance that at least one of the laser beams will interact with the receiver , which is mounted on a satellite orbiting the moon			2
this receiver uses a slightly narrower telescope to collect the light , which is then focused into an optical fibre similar to those used in terrestrial fibreoptic networks			0
from there , the signal is amplified about 30,000 times			0
a photodetector converts the pulses of light into electrical pulses that are in turn converted into data bit patterns that carry the transmitted message			0
at the conference on @entity91 and @entity92 ( @entity93 ) 2014 , held between 8 and 13 june in @entity94 , @entity95 the team will present new details and the first comprehensive overview of the ' on - orbit performance ' of their record - shattering laser - based communication uplink between the moon and @entity18 , which beat the previous record transmission speed by a factor of 4,800			1
earlier reports have stated what the team accomplished , but have not provided the details of the implementation			0
@entity56 of @entity11 said : ' this will be the first time that we present both the implementation overview and how well it actually worked			0
' the on - orbit performance was excellent and close to what we ’d predicted , giving us confidence that we have a good understanding of the underlying physics			1
' the team made history last year when their @entity120 ( @entity121 ) transmitted data over the 239,000 miles ( 385,000 ) kilometers between the moon and @entity18 at a download rate of 622 megabits per second , faster than any radio frequency ( @entity127 ) system			2
they also transmitted data from @entity18 to the moon at 19.44 megabits per second , a factor of 4,800 times faster than the best rf uplink ever used			0
@entity133 's @entity120 ( @entity121 ) involved two - way laser communication between the @entity136 spacecraft and @entity18			1
it showed that such a method could transmit huge amounts of data			2
this means , for example , hd video could be transmitted to and from deep space mr @entity56 added : ' communicating at high data rates from @entity18 to the moon with laser beams is challenging because of the 400,000 - kilometer distance spreading out the light beam			1
' it ’s doubly difficult going through the atmosphere , because turbulence can bend light - causing rapid fading or dropouts of the signal at the receiver			0
' we demonstrated tolerance to medium - size cloud attenuations , as well as large atmospheric - turbulence - induced signal power variations , or fading , allowing error - free performance even with very small signal margins			0
' while the @entity121 design is directly relevant for near - @entity18 missions , the team predicts that it ’s also extendable to deep - space missions to @entity165 and the outer planets .			2

scientists at @entity10 say they can transmit vast amounts of data across space
this could allow future astronauts to have access to a broadband network
system uses two - way laser communication and could transmit hd video
the team will present the results from their ' on - orbit test ' in june
the research builds upon a previous laser comms *experiment* in 2013
