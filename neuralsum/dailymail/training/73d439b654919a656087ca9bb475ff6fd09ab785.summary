by @entity0 published : 19:53 est , 10 january 2014 updated : 19:53 est , 10 january 2014 an antioxidant created in the lab could keep our skin younger for longer by protecting it from sun damage			2
scientists at @entity9 say the molecule , @entity11 , gives complete protection from @entity14 rays - which make up 95 per cent of the uv radiation in sunlight			1
they hope @entity11 could be given to people in food or cosmetics			1
discovery : molecule @entity11 gives complete protection from @entity14 rays - which make up 95 per cent of the uv radiation in sunlight ( library image ) @entity14 radiation speeds up skin ageing and causes wrinkles			1
it penetrates deep into the skin , damaging connective tissue and increasing the risk of skin cancer			2
the sun ’s rays also contain @entity35 , a type of radiation which causes sunburn and is again linked to skin cancer			1
team leader professor @entity38 said the results , published in the @entity40 , are ‘ exciting and promising ’			0
he added it is ‘ early days ’ for developing the antioxidant into a useable form – and more tests are needed to make sure it is not toxic			2
ageing : @entity14 radiation speeds up skin ageing and causes wrinkles			1
a commercial product including the molecule could be on the shelves within five years ( library image ) scientists already know antioxidants in green tea , red wine and spices can help to protect cells somewhat			0
but laboratory tests showed @entity11 provided 100 per cent @entity14 protection			1
mr @entity38 said a commercial product could be available within five years			0
@entity61 said the findings should be treated cautiously			0
dr @entity63 said : ‘ this research was done on cells in the lab			0
it is a long way off telling us whether it could be useful in any way in skin cancer prevention			0

@entity11 gives complete protection from @entity14 rays , scientist have found
@entity14 radiation penetrates the skin and speeds up ageing and wrinkling
more tests now being completed to *ensure* molecule is not toxic
