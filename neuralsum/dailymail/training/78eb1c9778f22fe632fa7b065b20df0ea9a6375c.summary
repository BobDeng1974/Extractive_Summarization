by @entity1 reporter published : 07:28 est , 3 september 2013 updated : 08:06 est , 3 september 2013 passengers on a cross-country @entity4 bus have criticised the firm for allegedly exposing them to a deadly illness by allowing a sick man to travel alongside them			1
customers spent two days travelling from @entity10 to @entity11 with a fellow passenger who was coughing up blood and may have been suffering from tuberculosis			1
the driver stopped the bus and called an ambulance - but paramedics said they were unable to test him for the disease and he was allowed to continue			1
anger : passengers claim they were exposed to illness on a @entity4 ( file photo ) passengers were apparently told that it would be pointless to exit the bus at that point as they had already been exposed to the ill man for so long			2
now they have spoken out , claiming that @entity4 should have taken better care of their health and done more to redress the problem			0
the incident is reminiscent of a scene in the 1969 film @entity34 in which the health of character @entity36 , played by @entity38 , seriously deteriorates over the course of a bus ride from @entity41 to @entity42			0
the character eventually passes away yet the bus driver continues the journey to @entity42			0
the sick man boarded the bus in @entity10 on saturday , according to @entity46 , but his condition deteriorated during the journey to @entity49			1
' we noticed how sick he was and then he started coughing and hacking up blood , ' passenger @entity50 said			0
by the time the bus was nearing its destination in @entity11 , passengers demanded that the man should be forced to leave because he could infect them			1
the @entity4 vehicle stopped in the town of @entity58 and the patient was examined by paramedics , who said it would take two days to determine if he was suffering from @entity63			2

' the ambulance said it would n't make any difference if [ i had ] already been exposed			0
