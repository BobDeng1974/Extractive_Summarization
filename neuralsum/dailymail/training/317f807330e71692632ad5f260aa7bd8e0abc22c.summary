dubbed ' @entity19 , ' the app sends a pre-written text message alerting of an imminent threat to one or several numbers programmed into it			2
' if i was getting abducted and i have my phone in my pocket , all i have to do is reach down and press the power button , ' @entity8 , of @entity23 , told @entity28			1
