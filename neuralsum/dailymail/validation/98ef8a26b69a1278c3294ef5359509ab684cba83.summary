@entity24 said mr @entity3 , editor of the paper the time the story broke in october 2005 , deliberately played down the scandal in the leader column , effectively saving mr @entity0 ’s political career			1
mr @entity24 told @entity31 tv : ' the editor at the time was @entity3 , and i think that 's worth remembering because of the future relationship that we have between the @entity38 , the prime minister and @entity3			1
' he added : ' @entity3 had done @entity40 a favour ; perhaps it was time for @entity0 to reciprocate and do a favour back			2
' but @entity38 @entity44 rounded on mr @entity24 , calling it a ' spurious ' attempt to embarrass the chancellor with ' the wprst sort of smear '			0

a lawyer representing @entity20 claims @entity3 ( left ) was helped into his number 10 role by @entity0 ( right ) because he was owed a ' favour ' mr @entity24 said : ‘ the decision on which spin to give to the story by the editor of the @entity7 particularly was something that determined his future in politics			1
‘ if it would have been written the other way it would have finished his career i ’m sure			0

@entity100 said : ‘ this is the worst sort of smear , where an account that has previously been put to bed is raised again on the back of other allegations			0
‘ it is a vacuous attempt to breathe life into an issue that has already died , by a lawyer who is clearly looking for financial advantage			0
’ @entity112 , another @entity38 mp , said : ‘ it appears to be a rather spurious attempt to embarrass a senior minister and link the government to the phone hacking scandal using the most lurid of claims			1
