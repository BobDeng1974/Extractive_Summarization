by @entity0 last updated at 5:59 pm on 20th february 2012 @entity2 inspectors arrived in @entity3 today in the latest push to hold key talks with @entity3 officials about how far the country 's controversial nuclear programme has come			1
@entity9 , a senior @entity2 nuclear official , said yesterday in @entity11 that he hoped for progress , but his careful choice of words suggested little expectation the meeting will be successful			0
their visit comes amid rising tensions after @entity20 announced it was planning to deploy rocket interceptors from its ' @entity23 ' defence system in the @entity24 from today			1
@entity26 talks : chief inspector @entity9 in @entity11 on his way to @entity3 a spokesman said the technology was being incorporated into the ' heart of the @entity20 military ' and would be set up in different areas in the @entity34 region of @entity24 in the coming days			1
he stressed that the deployment was intended as a training exercise only , but it will serve to fan speculation that @entity20 is gearing up for conflict			2
@entity20 has become even more wary of its @entity41 neighbour after two @entity3 warships docked at a @entity44 port on saturday - passing through the @entity45 for only the second time since the @entity48 revolution in 1979			1
the vessels - a supply ship and a destroyer - have docked in @entity52 , a port city in the volatile country which has been gripped by an 11 - month uprising against president @entity55			0
@entity3 defence minister @entity56 said the transit of the two ships through the @entity45 into the @entity59 ' is a symbol of our nation 's marine capability , ' it was reported in the @entity64			2
enrich : @entity3 president @entity65 's looking at a metal - encased rod with 20 % enriched nuclear fuel last week nuclear : @entity3 president @entity65 , centre , on a visit to @entity71 , 200 miles south of the capital @entity73 @entity20 , which said it will be watching the ships closely , has welcomed sanctions against @entity3 in a bid to halt its nuclear ambitions			1
but it has pointedly refused to rule out a military response to the crisis and in recent weeks sent signals that its patience is running thin			0
@entity84 foreign secretary @entity83 and the @entity85 warned such an offensive would have grave consequences for the entire region and called on @entity20 to give international sanctions against @entity73 more time to work			1
warning : @entity84 foreign secretary @entity83 has urged @entity20 not to attack @entity3 @entity85 joint chief of staff , general @entity91 said an attack would not be ' prudent '			1
it was not known whether their messages were co-ordinated			0
mr @entity83 's rhetoric goaded @entity3 into cutting off oil sales to @entity84 companies after he accused the @entity100 regime of promoting terrorism			1
the oil ministry in @entity73 announced that it had ceased all sales to the @entity84 and @entity104 , escalating diplomatic tensions triggered by @entity3 ’s nuclear programme			1
but the move will have little effect on @entity84 firms , which get well under one per cent of their oil from @entity3 since the @entity111 has already slapped sanctions on the country			1
the visit by the @entity2 inspectors is the second in less than a month by the @entity117 ( @entity117 ) team and reflects growing concerns over alleged weapons experiments - something @entity3 denies and refuses to discuss			1
the @entity122 suspects @entity3 's nuclear programme is geared toward making weapons but @entity3 insists it is for peaceful purposes only , such as power generation			2
@entity3 's state tv said the @entity117 team arrived this morning for a two - day visit			1
the state radio , meanwhile , said the inspectors hope to meet @entity3 nuclear scientists and pay a visit to the @entity134 military complex			1
the radio said the @entity117 had requested to visit @entity134 , an @entity3 military base and conventional weapons development facility outside of @entity73			2
the site has also been suspected of housing a secret underground facility used for @entity3 's nuclear programme - a claim denied by the @entity3			2
show of military might : one of the two @entity3 warships which crossed the @entity45 before docking at a @entity44 port yesterday in a move which will undoubtedly increase tensions in the volatile region @entity117 inspectors visited the site in 2005 , but only one of four areas of potential interest within the grounds			1
the nuclear watchdog did not report any unusual activities , and has not mentioned @entity134 in its reports since 2008			0
' whatever the reasoning of the agency is , it proves the @entity117 is not loyal to its previous commitments , ' the radio said			0
the tone of the commentary suggested the visit to the military complex would likely be denied			0
the @entity117 visit comes as @entity3 last week announced what it described as key advancements in its nuclear programme - inserting the first domestically made fuel rod into a research reactor in @entity73 and installing a new generation of @entity3 - made centrifuges at the country 's main uranium enrichment facility in the central town of @entity177			2
secretive : @entity3 state tv still of ' enrichment control ' room at the @entity177 facility @entity85 and its allies want @entity3 to halt uranium enrichment , which they believe could eventually lead to weapons - grade material and the production of nuclear weapons			2
@entity3 has been enriching uranium up to 20per cent , while uranium enriched to more than 90per cent can be used for a nuclear warhead			0
the @entity117 team wants to talk to key @entity3 scientists suspected of working on an alleged weapons programme			0
they also hope to break down opposition to their plans to inspect documents related to nuclear work and secure commitments from @entity3 authorities to allow future visits			0
@entity3 has denied alleged weapons experiments for nearly four years , saying they are based on ' fabricated documents ' provided by a ' few arrogant countries ' -- a phrase authorities in @entity3 often use to refer to the @entity85 and its western allies			2
the @entity117 summarised its information last november in a 13 - page document drawing on 1,000 pages of intelligence			0
it stated then for the first time that some of the alleged experiments can have no other purpose than developing nuclear weapons			0
2012 was supposed to be the year of the economy			0
but as that begins , like a giant oil tanker , to slowly change direction , @entity3 is another mighty problem looming on the horizon for @entity223 , right			0
the @entity85 president promised a change of approach – who will forget the feeling of hope that accompanied his ‘ @entity231 ’ address to the @entity3 people soon after his inauguration ? but some @entity235 officials are now referring to 2012 as the @entity236			1
@entity238 , an influential blogger for the @entity239 , a website for ‘ new ideas and thinkers , is talking about ‘ @entity223 ’s impending " @entity237 " '			0
and with the arrival of @entity3 warships in the @entity59 and a seriously unhappy @entity20 ’s @entity246 due to visit @entity247 in a fortnight , the @entity3 problem has assumed the status of ‘ major headache ’			1
@entity251 is making great play of @entity223 ’s ‘ dove - ish ’ approach , saying a vote for him would pave the way for @entity3 to get the bomb , while @entity257 , who has huge financial backing , is even more gung - ho on the way to tame @entity261 leaves @entity223 with some big questions should the @entity122 ’s relationship with @entity65 continue to deteriorate			0
to strike or not to strike is the sort of dilemma that keeps presidents awake at night .			0

second visit by atomic agency in a month , but officials admit there 's little chance of progress
@entity20 fuels speculation of military action after moving rocket interceptor *missiles* to @entity24 region
tensions rise after two @entity3 warships dock at @entity44 port after *sailing* through @entity282
@entity84 and @entity85 warn of grave consequences if @entity20 attacks @entity3
