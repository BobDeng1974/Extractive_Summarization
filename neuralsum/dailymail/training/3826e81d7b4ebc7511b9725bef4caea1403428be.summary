astronomers recently spotted seven galaxies that appeared around 13.1 billion years ago - 700 million years after the @entity2			1
where the galaxies came from initially confused the experts because they seemed to appear almost out of nowhere , very rapidly			1
but now the team behind the observations suggest the previously hidden cluster of stars appeared when a cosmic ' fog ' cleared			1
these colour composite images from the @entity12 show the seven galaxies found in the study , as they would have looked 13.1 billion years ago - but their sudden appearance is a bit of a mystery			1
they have a red colour due to the effects of cosmic expansion on their light the latest discovery , published in the @entity24 , was made by a team of astronomers at the @entity27 using the @entity12 in @entity28			2
although earlier galaxies have been spotted by the @entity31 , the telescope is significant as it looks for a particular type called @entity33 ( @entity34 )			1
the universe was born in the @entity2 some 13.8 billion years ago			1
in its earliest epochs , it was filled with a hot ' soup ' of charged protons and electrons			0
as the newborn universe expanded , its temperature decreased uniformly			0
when the universe was 400,000 years old , conditions were cool enough to allow the protons and electrons to bond and form neutral hydrogen atoms			1
that event is called ' recombination ' and resulted in a universe filled with a ' fog ' of these neutral atoms			2
eventually the first stars and galaxies began to form , and their ultraviolet light ionised ( energised ) the hydrogen atoms , and ' divided ' the neutral hydrogen into protons and electrons again			2
as this occurred , the ' fog ' of neutrals cleared			0
astronomers call this event ' cosmic reionisation ' and think that it ended about 12.8 billion years ago - about a billion years after the @entity2			1
the timing of this event - when it started and how long it lasted - is one of the big questions in astronomy			0
laes were primitive , low mass galaxies and are among the oldest types known in the universe			2
they are thought to have been the progenitor for modern , @entity79 - type galaxies			0
using the telescope , the team , led by graduate student @entity81 and dr @entity82 , were looking to find the role @entity73 played in an event called ' cosmic reionisation '			0
when the universe was 400,000 years old , conditions were cool enough to allow the protons and electrons to bond and form neutral hydrogen atoms			1
that event is called ' recombination ' and resulted in a universe filled with a ' fog ' of these neutral atoms			0
eventually the first stars and galaxies began to form , and their ultraviolet light ionised - or energised - the hydrogen atoms , and ' divided ' the neutral hydrogen into protons and electrons again			2
as this occurred , the ' fog ' of neutrals cleared			0
astronomers call this event ' cosmic reionisation ' and think that it ended about 12.8 billion years ago - about a billion years after the @entity2			1
the timing of this event - when it started and how long it lasted - is one of the big questions in astronomy			0
to investigate this cosmic reionisation , the @entity12 team searched for early @entity118 galaxies at a distance of 13.1 billion light years			0
' at first we were very disappointed at this small number , ' mr @entity81 said			0
' but we realised that this indicates @entity34 appeared suddenly about 13 billion years ago			1
' this is an exciting discovery			0
we can see that the luminosities suddenly brightened during the 700 to 800 million years after the @entity2			1
what would cause this ? ' the latest discovery , published in the @entity24 , was made by a team of astronomers at the @entity27 using the @entity12 ( pictured ) in @entity28			0
although earlier galaxies have been spotted by the @entity31 , @entity12 is significant as it looks for @entity33 ( @entity34 ) in the team 's analysis , they suggest neutral fog that once filled the universe began to clear about 13 billion years ago , which resulted in @entity34 suddenly appearing for the first time			1
shown left is a distant lae and right is what one might look like from up close according to the team 's observations , one reason that @entity34 appeared very quickly is cosmic reionisation			2
@entity73 during the time of cosmic reionisation became darker than their actual luminosity due to the presence of the neutral hydrogen fog			2
in the team 's analysis , they suggest the possibility that the neutral fog filling the universe was cleared about 13 billion years ago and @entity34 suddenly appeared in sight for the first time			1
' however , there are other possibilities to explain why @entity73 appeared suddenly , ' said dr @entity82 , the principal investigator on the programme			1
' one is that clumps of neutral hydrogen around @entity34 disappeared			2
another is that @entity34 became intrinsically bright			0
' the reason of the intrinsic brightening is that the @entity161 is not efficiently produced by the ionised clouds in a lae due to the significant escape of ionising photons from the galaxy			0
' in either case , our discovery is an important key to understanding cosmic reionisation and the properties of the @entity172 in early universe			0

astronomers recently found galaxies that seemed to appear from nowhere
known as @entity33 ( @entity34 ) - the galaxies sprung into view 700 million years after the @entity2
why they appeared so suddenly initially confused the astronomers
but , they now suggest it was due to the clearing of a ' fog ' in the universe
as hydrogen was *swept* away , hidden galaxies were rapidly revealed
this may explain how the galaxies appear to form *incredibly* rapidly
