by @entity0 on a night when they were cheered from the stands at @entity4 by one of the track stars of @entity7 2014 , @entity1 finally got their season off - and - running			1
yet while the pre-match presence of @entity12 - a lifelong @entity1 fan and @entity15 silver medallist in the 800metres - proved a catalyst for @entity18 ’s men roaring out of the blocks early , his team ultimately and disappointingly limped over the line against a @entity22 side who finished this @entity24 tie with 10 men			1
indeed , had @entity28 ’ frontmen remembered to pack their shooting boots , they could easily have added to @entity18 ’s roll of dishonour in knockout competitions since he took over from @entity33 in 2011			1
swish ! @entity34 curled in wonderfully as @entity1 beat @entity35 's @entity22 in extra-time at @entity4 pride : @entity15 silver medallist @entity12 was at the game to cheer the @entity39 on after young @entity41 had cancelled out @entity43 ’s fine first - half goal , @entity40 missed a sitter before @entity45 squandered two fabulous chances to deny @entity28 what would have been a tremendous start to his new job at @entity22			1
there was to be further frustration for the visitors when @entity41 was red - carded for a foul on @entity54 , @entity34 making sure @entity1 ’ numerical advantage counted by striking the goal that finally saw off @entity22			1
it also teed up an intriguing @entity4 date later this month against a @entity60 side managed by @entity4 legend @entity61			1
despite an ultimately satisfying scoreline for @entity1 , this was another stuttering performance by @entity18 ’s side on a night when the attendance at @entity4 was a worrying 18,138 for a clash between two teams destined to battle it out with @entity68 for the @entity70 title			1
whether that was down to the lack of allure of the @entity24 - the recently re-branded @entity71 - or symptomatic of the strained relationship between the rank - and - file @entity1 fans and the club ’s board remains to be seen			0
it had all started so promisingly for @entity18 , whose returning strike duo of @entity82 and @entity83 were cheered to the rafters by the home crowd			0
for @entity82 , it was 14 years to the day since his very first @entity1 goal , the winner in a 3 - 2 thriller at @entity89			0
parade : @entity12 was shown off to the @entity4 crowd beforehand with a shirt commemorating her 800m silver there were warm @entity4 welcomes , too , for fellow new signings @entity97 and @entity98 , who joined captain @entity100 at the back in a 3 - 5 - 2 formation that the manager had road - tested in @entity104			1
@entity28 , meanwhile , gave debuts to goalkeeper @entity106 , full back @entity107 and striker @entity45			1
his fourth summer signing @entity110 - a previous @entity1 target - had to settle for a place on the bench			0
@entity83 nearly made a dream start to his second @entity4 debut when his volley flew into the side netting , causing some within @entity4 to rise in celebration			1
but the former @entity119 striker had been flagged offside			0
it was to be a recurring theme			0
@entity1 made a deserved breakthrough , however , when @entity123 floated a great ball towards @entity43 at the far side of the box			2
the @entity128 under - 21 midfielder cushioned the ball perfectly before thumping a superb finish low beyond @entity106			0
@entity43 has now clearly recovered from a virus that attacked his internal organs and led him to miss the first six months of the year			2
on this form , the 20 - year - old is going to be a big player for @entity1 this season			0
all smiles : manager @entity18 joins in the celebrations after @entity34 notched the winner @entity18 ’s team were comfortable at that point and @entity83 thought he had doubled the lead from 18 yards , but this time he was denied by referee @entity142 who ruled he had controlled the ball with his hand in the build - up			0
it was clear that @entity28 had @entity22 playing a more pleasing passing game than under predecessor @entity148 but the same old lack of creativity and penetration remained a problem			1
however , the @entity154 side were a team transformed after the break			0
@entity28 should have had his first competitive goal to cheer when @entity40 was played in on goal by @entity158 but he fluffed an excellent chance			2
his weak shot , straight at @entity161 , was as threatening as a pass back			0
@entity22 grabbed the goal their play merited when @entity97 lost the ball and @entity41 made @entity1 pay for their shambolic defencing by slotting the ball under the outrushing @entity161			1
@entity169 should then have put @entity22 ahead but he volleyed a @entity158 chip over the bar from 16 yards with just @entity161 to beat			1
@entity18 moved to a regular back four when he sent on winger @entity174 in a bid to inject creativity into his team			0
flased an effort wide : @entity22 's @entity45 fails to convert a chance from close range but it was @entity45 who missed another fine opportunity when he headed an @entity185 corner over from close range			2
then came the game - changing moment when @entity41 went in hard on @entity54 , drawing a red card from @entity142 that looked , at first glance , questionable			2
a man to the good and having perked up a little , @entity1 saw a penalty claim turned down by @entity142 after @entity107 held @entity123 in the box			0
so into extra time we went , and only 11 minutes had elapsed when the hammer blow came for @entity22			2
after @entity22 midfielder @entity198 fell to the ground with cramp , @entity123 cleverly capitalised on the extra space - driving into the box before cutting back for law who curled the ball beautifully into the far corner			2
@entity1 fan @entity12 would have been relieved to see that @entity22 ’ race was now run			1
despite being given an almighty fright , her beloved @entity1 remain in the hunt for silverware and the chance to avenge the hurt of last season ’s final defeat to @entity215 .			0

@entity43 had put the hosts into a first half lead
@entity41 equalised for @entity28 ' @entity22 to force extra-time
@entity15 star @entity12 was paraded at @entity4
