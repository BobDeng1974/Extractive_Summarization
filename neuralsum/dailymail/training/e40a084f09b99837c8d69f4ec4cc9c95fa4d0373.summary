by @entity0 published : 13:21 est , 20 may 2013 updated : 15:31 est , 20 may 2013 a distraught @entity2 couple have denied they neglected their parental duties after their 407lbs 15 - year - old son died and his chronically ill sister passed away just four months later			1
despite losing their remaining 12 - year - old daughter to a care home , @entity8 and @entity9 are adamant that they are good parents - reminding authorities they have buried two of their children after doing everything they could for them			1
' nobody knows what it is like to have to do cpr on your own child , ' said an emotional @entity9 as she spoke about her daughter @entity24			1
' i would n’t go through it again , not in a million years			0
i done everything i could … to bring her back ' @entity8 and @entity9 at their home in @entity32 , @entity2 - they deny any neglect of their disabled children who died within four months of each other last year however , after the consecutive deaths of morbidly obese @entity40 , 15 , who weighed 407 pounds in april and his sister from cystic fibrosis in july , concerns across child welfare in @entity38 have grown			1
both @entity8 and @entity9 were unable to work due to illness and the @entity45 newspaper , which conducted an investigation into the teenagers deaths , raising the point that child welfare services might have neglected the children along with the parents			1
' if you ’re looking to lay blame on somebody , a lot of people could be blamed , ' said @entity57 , state ombudsman for children and families to the @entity45			2
' there could be a dozen people who knew about it			0
probably , some of these people were helping these parents			0
' the community , somehow , ' he said , ' becomes desensitized			0
' diagnosed with the chronic lung condition cystic fibrosis in 2002 , @entity24 was investigated by the @entity68 ( @entity68 ) after she was found wondering alone at a trailer park when she was aged five			1
the @entity9 's second child , @entity40 suffered from developmental issues and struggled with learning and speech - growing to 450 pounds			1
' he was like a teddy bear , ' said @entity9			2
@entity75 ( left ) ballooned to 405 pounds before his death following seizure in march 2012 - while @entity78 ( right ) died in july 2012 after also suffering a seizure and apparent stimulant overdose both parents did not work and relied on food stamps and the disability checks @entity40 and @entity24 were issued by the government			1
they supplemented that income by scrapping metal and mowing lawns			0
neither parent qualified for state disability payments			0
' it was kinda hard for me and @entity8 to shop because we had to get foods for @entity40 that was n’t fattening and foods for @entity24 that had a whole lot of fattening in it to help her gain weight , ' said @entity9			1
in 2009 , someone told @entity68 that the children were not being looked after properly - so someone came to investigate			2
' she said she did n’t see no problem , that we had done all we could for our children , ' explained @entity9			1
' she said , ‘ instead of people picking on you all , ’ she said , ‘ i think they should help you			0
’ that was her words			0
' however , the descent of @entity40 caused his health needs to go unanswered			2
he had a history of mild mental retardation , sleep apnea , an unknown thyroid problem and morbid obesity , records show			0
by november 2011 , his appetite had become such an issue that doctors told the heads to nail down every cupboard and chain the refrigerator			0
@entity8 and @entity9 were investigated by police - however , no charges were pressed - but child welfare services took away their remaining 12 - year - old child after the deaths of their elder children last year by march 2012 his health had deteriorated to such an extent that as the family traveled to the @entity130 noticed @entity40 turning pale and struggling to breathe			1
on the way to hospital he suffered a seizure , and his last words were , ' am i going to remember you and @entity138 ? ' tragically , @entity40 died from a pulmonary embolism and the medical examiner ruled his death to be of natural causes and listed morbid obesity as a contributing factor			1
however , tragedy struck again just four months later in july when at 3.29 a , m. on the morning of july 19th , paramedics arrived at the @entity9 's home to find @entity24 unresponsive - with blood pouring from her nose			1
again , the heads had phone for help when their child began seizing and when the first attempt to revive her was unsuccessful they attempted to revive the girl by throwing water on her			2
the heads told paramedics they did not know what had caused the attack , according to the @entity68 case file			0
however , the @entity9 's youngest sister told the @entity68 that @entity24 had overdosed on @entity164 - a drug used to control attention deficit hyperactivity disorder			1
the possibility of a drug overdose was not mentioned by police or paramedics in their reports , according to the medical examiner who performed an autopsy - but a paramedic did note that the home was in a foul condition with food and cockroaches lying everywhere			2
@entity179 of @entity180 ( @entity68 ) in addition , the surviving 12 - year - old child told investigators that @entity24 became sick at 11 p.m. - four hours before the 911 call was made			1
and the girl said it was she , not a parent , who called			0
' nobody knows what it is like to have to do cpr on your own child , ' @entity9 said to the @entity45 , as she began to cry			1
“ ' i would n’t go through it again , not in a million years			0
i done everything i could … to bring her back			2
' the @entity198 in @entity2 concluded that the heads were responsible for neglect in @entity24 's case , but not @entity202 's and their 12 - year - old girl was taken away from them			1
they have not been charged			0
according to the @entity45 the heads said they are trying to abide by the court orders and @entity68 demands that could return the child			2
' they ’ve been under pressure to pay child support and have had to complete iq tests and undergo a home inspection			0
“ they twist around what the truth is and do n’t take time to talk to the parents to know what ’s going on , ” @entity8 said			2
“ they did n’t live with us			0
they did n’t know what we were doing			0
' it ’s strange that two kids died within five months , but @entity40 was natural causes and @entity24 was accidental , ' he added			1
' it ’s very difficult when you lose your oldest daughter and oldest son			0

@entity8 and @entity9 lost two of their three children last year in the space of four months
@entity40 and sister @entity24 died in similar circumstances after both suffering seizures
child welfare in @entity2 have taken the @entity9 's surviving 12 - year - old daughter away from them
