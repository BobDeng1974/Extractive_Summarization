many teenage girls spend a decent chunk of their beauty grooming time trying to hide all signs of baby hair on the forehead			1
but it seems it is now about to become a blessing , as baby hair is one of the beauty trends for this summer			1
as championed by the likes of @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 , the short fluff around the top of the forehead is becoming a key accessory			1
@entity13 regularly makes a feature of her baby hair @entity14 wore slicked down baby hair at the @entity23 show last month , while @entity15 is also a fan the style is worn gelled down on the forehead , styled into curls and wavy tendrils			1
the cutting - edge pop stars are n't the only ones using the style though - several top name designers have also been using their look in their catwalk shows			0
in february , @entity34 sent his models down the runway at the @entity23 show with wet look baby hair			2
the @entity39 show at @entity40 also used the look , but in a more other - worldy manner			0
model 's at the @entity23 show in february sported baby hair and facial jewellery the look also appeared it he @entity50 show and last month 's @entity39 show in @entity52 the style is n't new - it has been adopted from black and @entity55 cultures in the @entity56 , who have used the look for many years			1
while the look appears to have the beginnings of a new trend among fashion designers , many have been unimpressed by its use in the shows			0
@entity67 users commented in their hundreds on the look after it featured at @entity23 , with many voicing their distaste			0
one user called @entity73 wrote : ' @entity23 had white models with slicked down " baby hairs " i do n't know if that counts as embracing afro - hair			0
' another called @entity79 said : ' not a fan of @entity23 's gelled baby hair look for their models			2
when has high fashion ever given a damn about appropriation ?			0
