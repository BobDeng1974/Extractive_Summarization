@entity2 are quizzing officers over the so - called ' @entity14 ' where @entity7 served up coffee and cake			1
the police force had said in october that it had no information regarding officers visiting @entity7 's flat in @entity22 , @entity23 , but added that they were ' free to do what they wished when off - duty '			1
but a spokesman has confirmed that further inquiries are being made to gain a ' better understanding ' of the relationship between officers and the shamed former @entity29 police are said to have attended while being encouraged to play a more active role in the community			1
but the spokesman said that there is no evidence of any wrongdoing by force employees past or present			2
he said : ' local officers working in the community were invited by @entity7 to his home for a coffee			2
' at that time the force was encouraging community officers to interact more with residents in their area			2
the officers usually visited on a friday			2
' it was usual for other friends of @entity7 to be present drinking coffee and chatting			0
