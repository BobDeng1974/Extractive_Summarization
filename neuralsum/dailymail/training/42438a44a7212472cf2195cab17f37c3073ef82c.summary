@entity0 was arrested after he was overheard aiming the offensive word at a group of men in @entity12 , @entity13 , on september 10			1
but the sign - writer claimed he could n’t be racist because he listened to hip - hop music , had ' more black friends than white friends ' and this is what he called everyone			2
police charged him with using racially - aggravated words or behaviour and @entity0 was hauled before magistrates last week			1
and he was cleared of racist abuse after successfully arguing that he regularly uses the word n * * * * r as ' a term of endearment ' on the streets around his home			1
@entity32 ruled he had used the phrase without hostility - and dismissed the case			1
' we find the language used alleged by the prosecution , but he did not use it to demonstrate hostility towards a group - but used it in parlance , ' the chair of the bench said			2
' we do not find the defendant guilty			0
' defending , @entity47 said the word had crept into the @entity50 language and is frequently used on the estate where he is from			2
' this word has crept into the @entity50 language and is used on a regular basis , ' he said			2
' his use of the word is popular culture			2
' he is of the opinion he simply addressed these people as he addresses them in daily speak			0
' plea : @entity0 and his wife @entity59 both want the public to know he is not racist and says he uses the phrase as a ' term of endearment ' @entity63 : @entity0 , pictured with his dog , successfully argued he had ' more black friends than white friends ' and was not a racist speaking for the first time since the case mr @entity0 insisted he was not a racist			1
case : @entity32 ruled @entity0 had used the phrase without hostility - and let him go free mr @entity0 , who describes himself on his @entity75 page as a “ chief tokin futha mucka ” said : ' i listen to hip hop music , it is just a standard word and not a racial thing to me at all			1
' i probably have more black friends than i have white friends and this is just how i speak			0
' i am not surprised that i went to court as the law has to flex its muscles			0
' i am not a racist , it was used as slang			0
for me it is a term of endearment , not something racist			1
' i like hip hop and it is a word that is used all the time in music			0
' i can be sat with a black friend and i will say ‘ what up , n * * * * * ? ’ , and it ’s a term of endearment			1
” his wife @entity59 , 43 , added : ' he is not a troublemaker			0
we are in no way racist			0
' however anti-race campaigners yesterday condemned the court ruling saying the word had too many negative connotations and should not be used in any circumstances			0
@entity107 , who helps to organise an annual carnival in @entity12 to promote multiculturalism , said : ' the magistrates have made a mistake - you can not just sling words like that around			0
' it is the last word you should use towards someone who is black			1
it has too many negative historical links			0

@entity0 argued the word is a ' term of endearment ' for him
' i can be sat with a black friend and i will say ‘ what up , n * * * * * ? ’ he said
magistrates threw out case and agreed it was not said with ' hostility '
' it is the last word you should use towards someone who *'s* black , ' *critics* say
