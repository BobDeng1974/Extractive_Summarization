last week , i received a very strange invite asking me to come down to a tv studio packed with men and women and then , in the full glare of the spotlight , to publicly grab my own crotch			2
usually this sort of behaviour gets your collar felt by the long arm of the law for indecent exposure but on this occasion i was assured it would be all for a good cause			0
that cause turned out to be the check one two movement 's # @entity20 campaign , which aims to persuade men to regularly check their tackle for testicular cancer regularly			1
clearly , it is a most worthy campaign and so , i was happy to get involved			2
worthy cause : @entity26 was invited to grab his crotch as part of the # @entity20 movement over 2,000 new cases of testicular cancer are found each year in the @entity32 , mostly in men from age 20 - 39 ( so that 's me included ) , but thankfully this cancer has a relatively high chance of being cured , as long as you detect it early enough - hence this big awareness campaign for men to check their goolies			1
so all you have to do is this			0
send a twitter picture or video , or some other social media platform that you communicate on posting : ' i 'm # @entity48 ' and then add something funny / witty / whatever and the all important @entity50 and then challenge another couple of friends ( girls and boys ) to do the crotch grab challenge as well			0
spreading the word : @entity26 and co-star @entity57 attended the # @entity50 event at the @entity59 feeling charitable : @entity26 was keen to get on board with the charity as he says it is a very worthy cause also while you 're down there it would be a good idea to check your gonads for any strange bumps which could be cancer			1
the @entity71 campaign is building fast and so far @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 and even @entity76 have posted pictures of themselves delicately cupping their genitals			1
more celebrity support turned up for the # @entity20 event at the @entity59 in @entity81 's @entity80 , which i was at , along with my made in @entity84 colleague @entity57 and @entity73 who was hosting the event			1
important issues : while there @entity26 and @entity57 were interviewed by @entity89 actor @entity88 @entity90 : @entity26 says that his interview with @entity75 was probably one of his most uncomfortable ones to date we were interviewed by @entity73 's former co-star on @entity97 drama @entity89 , actor @entity88 , who plays @entity100 on the show			2
@entity88 did the interview in the style of the @entity100 â€“ the very nerdy and socially inept @entity105 geology student			0
it was possibly the most painful interview i 've ever done but was nowhere near as awkward and grabbing my own crotch in front of the 200 - strong predominantly female crowd			0
luckily it appeared to go down well with the audience			0
but i wo n't be making a habit of it			0
to find out more about the # @entity20 campaign visit @entity116 time to chill : @entity117 managed to squeeze in a cheeky drink post interview getting on board : @entity72 joined the movement after being nominated by @entity75			1

this week , @entity26 has joined the # @entity20 campaign
it was *created* to *encourage* men to check for testicular cancer
other celebrities to join include @entity72 and @entity73
