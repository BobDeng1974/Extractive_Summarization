these are the stunning views from atop @entity1 – but you ’ll need to be an expert climber with a head for heights and an appetite for danger to reach the country ’s tallest peak in winter			2
a group of brave mountain climbers captured these incredible images as they conquered the treacherous ice - covered rock face using ropes , spikes and crampons			1
their photos reveal the breath - taking beauty of the landscape surrounding the snow - capped peak of 4,400ft @entity24 in the western end of @entity27 ’s @entity26			2
@entity28 captured this amazing image during a dangerous climb to the top of @entity24 , @entity1 's tallest peak to get there , the climbers had to trek through the @entity35 , which is tricky as the steep , narrow path is only accessible for the most experienced of climbers			1
it is a challenging climb in fair weather but it becomes treacherous and fraught with danger when it is covered in snow and whipped by the frigid wind			2
@entity28 , an adventure and travel photographer and writer , took the photos as experienced climbers @entity49 and @entity50 scaled the peak			1
it was mr @entity28 's first climb in @entity27 and he says the scariest part was the ' sense of remoteness and isolation ' in the @entity58 @entity28 said : ‘ winter climbing has inherent objective dangers such as weather and conditions			1
‘ the climb itself is three to four pitches long and took maybe two hours , including lots of stopping for photographs			0
‘ @entity69 climbing requires specialist equipment - the obvious being crampons , stiff boots and technical ice axes			0
‘ standard climbing gear is also needed , like ropes and harnesses , but another specialist piece is a rack of ice screws for protection			0
' it took the group - @entity28 , @entity49 and @entity50 - around two hours to reach the peak of the mountain in @entity27 he added : ‘ the clothing required to stay active and safe in @entity27 winter condition is also very specialised			1
‘ i honestly do n't remember what it was like reaching the top as i was so focused on shooting the photos			0
‘ all i know is the job was n't finished until we were safely down			0
’ this was @entity28 ’s first climb in @entity27			2
the brave climbers conquered the treacherous ice - covered rock face using ropes , spikes and crampons the 36 - year - old , from @entity102 , said : ‘ i 've done a fair bit of mountaineering and ice climbing in the @entity106 and other mountain ranges but this was my first taste of @entity27 winter			1
‘ i felt perfectly safe being with two highly experienced mountain professionals , but the scariest part was the surprising sense of remoteness and isolation you feel in the @entity58			1
‘ the picture of @entity118 in the green jacket climbing out of the cave is the stand out feature of the climb			0
‘ the shot does n't do justice to the difficulty of committing your swing out on to the face			0
‘ however , i think it does capture the feeling of trepidation whilst waiting for your turn			0
