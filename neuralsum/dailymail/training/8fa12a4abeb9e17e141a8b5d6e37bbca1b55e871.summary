by @entity0 published : 11:56 est , 27 april 2012 updated : 14:35 est , 27 april 2012 after spending most of their lives in human care , this was the day three orangutans reacquainted themselves with the place they once called home			1
tentatively exploring their new surroundings , the animals ' apprehension was soon replaced with curiosity and a playful first moments of freedom			1
@entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 were the first orangutans to be returned to the wild in @entity20 for almost a decade after going through a rehabilitation programme in @entity22			1
first moments of freedom : @entity15 reacquaints herself with the rainforest as she is released into the wilds of @entity27 , in @entity28 , @entity20 a swinging time : eight - year - olds @entity16 ( left ) and @entity17 ( right ) play in the trees of the @entity31 and @entity32 before their relocation and release in @entity28 , @entity20 first class flight : @entity15 ( pictured ) , @entity16 and @entity36 were flown by helicopter from the @entity31 and @entity32 in @entity28 they were reintroduced to the forests of @entity40 in the south of the island by the @entity43 ( @entity44 ) , from its rescue and reintroduction centre in @entity28			1
these extraordinary images show how , after spending most of their lives in human care the three orangutans were playing happily in the jungle treetops - as nature intended			1
the rare release of one of the world 's most endangered primate species was made possible by funding provided by an international group of fundraising partners , including @entity62 charity , @entity61			1
the now - free trio were airlifted from the @entity31 and @entity32 in the east of the island of @entity22 to the @entity40 forest to the south			1
release team member , @entity68 , described what it was like to witness the orangutans take their first steps of freedom			1
she said : ' @entity15 was not sure at first			2
she spent her first few moments of freedom just climbing and playing around her enclosure			2
jungle trek : the trio were carried through the forest to @entity80 , and finally released into the @entity81 @entity15 ( left ) , now aged eight , almost literally burnt her hand off at the age of four when her owner allowed her to play near electric cables			1
@entity16 ( right ) arrived in november 2006			2
at the time of rescue , she weighed 7 kg safeguarding the survival of the species : the release programme creates a place of safety for semi-wild or rehabilitated orangutans , where they can live in freedom and create new , viable wild populations ' but soon enough , she realised there were so many trees around her			1
' she headed to a nearest tree and started to climb , before finally settling on one of the branches high above , waiting for her two friends			2
' we moved to the next enclosure where both @entity16 and @entity36 were anxiously waiting			2
they had seen @entity15 and realised what was going on			2
' we opened the enclosure and witnessed @entity16 and @entity36 quickly bolted out and climbed a tree together			0
' not long after , @entity16 and @entity36 joined @entity15 and the three of them were seen swinging happily in the forest canopy			0
' the lucky - three were transported in an @entity20 @entity114 helicopter to their new rainforest home			0
remote : a helicopter touches down on the edge of the orangutans ' new home as they begin the last leg of their journey to freedom precious cargo : scientists believe there could be just 45,000 wild orangutans left on the whole island of @entity22 - a decline of 50 per cent in the last 60 years dr @entity132 , director of the @entity44 , explained the challenges of moving these amazing - but heavy - creatures from their base camp , on foot , across 700 yards of dense rainforest			1
he said : ' the team had to carry the three transport cages , crossing rivers five times , on foot			0
' it was n't easy - each of these orangutans weighs between 50 and 70 pounds			0
' so we had to stop several times to rest and catch our breaths			0
' finally , we arrived at the release site where we had constructed two spacious enclosures - one for @entity16 and @entity36 - and another one for @entity15			0
' we needed to put them in these enclosures for a day or two to give them time to adjust with the new surroundings			0
in danger of extinction : conservationists are working hard to preserve the future of orangutans into the wild : a special convoy makes its way through the jungle , leading the orangutans to their new home ' this would also give us time to observe them and ensure that they were ready to be released			0
' scientists believe there could be just 45,000 wild orangutans left on the whole island of @entity22 - a decline of 50 - percent in the last 60 years			1
the main threat to their lives is the destruction of their habitat , the rainforest , by logging companies and the establishment of oil palm plantations			0
the historic release was made possible by the @entity20 @entity184 , the @entity185 and the @entity186			0
other key partners included the regional governments of @entity28 , @entity189 and @entity190 as well as the @entity191 of @entity28 and the people of @entity189 and @entity190 .			0
