@entity0 must deliver performances worthy of his £ 60million price tag if @entity3 are to achieve their goal of @entity6 football , according to @entity7			1
@entity8 has failed to live up to his early promise in a @entity3 shirt since his big - money move from @entity12 in the summer			2
and former @entity3 defender @entity7 is sympathetic to the reasons why the @entity15 international has struggled over the last eight months at @entity16 – but says it is time for him to deliver			1
@entity0 struggled to make an impact on @entity3 's game at @entity20 @entity8 looks dejected after he was take off at @entity21 @entity22 came on to replace @entity8 on wednesday night in @entity20 @entity8 has struggled to live up to his £ 60m price tag in recent months writing in his @entity25 column , @entity7 cites the burglary of @entity8 ’s house at the end of january , his lack of @entity30 and coming to terms with the fact he did not want to leave the @entity33 in the summer as some of the reasons why he has been off the boil			1
@entity7 said : ‘ i fully expected @entity8 and @entity40 to form a devastating partnership down the left flank and , even at close to £ 60m , i had no thoughts whatsoever that his signing was a risk			0
‘ when he dribbled down the wing at the @entity45 before chipping the @entity46 goalkeeper @entity47 to score his second goal in three games since arriving from @entity12 , the @entity3 fan in me was so excited and i was thinking , ‘ here we go ! ’ @entity8 has had a difficult few months at @entity3 after his great start to life at @entity16 @entity8 did not want to leave @entity12 in the summer but was sold to @entity3 for £ 60m ‘ it was an example of everything i expected @entity8 to bring to the @entity56 - pace , audacity and a moment of magic capable of turning a game			1
‘ but since that day , @entity8 has scored just two more goals - one of them coming against @entity62 in the @entity63 - and he has quite simply looked a shadow of his former self			0
’ ‘ he has come to @entity3 when he did not want to leave @entity12 , has suffered the trauma of a burglary , and started to work for a new manager while playing in a team that is still in a ‘ storm ’ phase of development			0
@entity8 scored an excellent goal for @entity3 away at @entity46 earlier in the season ‘ all of those are factors that would go some way to explaining why @entity8 has struggled after his bright start , but i feel as though i have a parrot on either shoulder , with one telling me to give the benefit of the doubt because of those reasons while the other is saying that , actually , the time has come for a £ 60m player to deliver			2
' @entity3 are still in the top four of the @entity56 and face @entity88 at @entity16 in the @entity89 of the @entity63			0
and if @entity91 ’s side are to end the season on a high then @entity7 says @entity8 will be required to play a major role			0
he added : ‘ if @entity3 are to achieve their aims this season , primarily @entity6 qualification , @entity8 is going to have to rid himself of the complexities that have emerged over the past eight months and escape the demons that are playing on his mind			2

@entity0 has been substituted in recent games for @entity3
the @entity15 star has struggled with life in @entity30 in recent months
@entity8 must deliver if @entity3 are to qualify for the @entity6
