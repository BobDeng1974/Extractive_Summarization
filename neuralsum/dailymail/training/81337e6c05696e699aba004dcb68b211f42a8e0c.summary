a @entity1 legend who once wrestled headliners like @entity3 and @entity4 is now a double amputee living in poverty in rural @entity7			1
now all @entity8 , who rose to fame as @entity8 in the 1980s , has left from those days as a pro wrestler on the national stage are his memories			2
and with his continued optimism in the face of nightly dialysis , a tragic family story and mounting bills to pay , @entity8 hopes to put those memories down on paper in an autobiography called @entity21			1
rise and fall : @entity8 , aka @entity22 the @entity23 , once wrestled @entity1 headliners like @entity3 , but has since lost his legs to diabetes and is living in rural @entity7 in poverty named ironically , since his cannibalistic character spoke only in grunts in the ring , the tome is the focus of a @entity34 donation drive			1
after all , as @entity8 recently told @entity36 , ' life is worth living			2
' but that does n't mean there has n't been heartache			0
the @entity7 native lost a parent at the tender age of 4 when his father was killed during a game of dice			1
to date , he 's also lost his sister to murder , a son to @entity49 and his mother			0
it appeared that @entity8 , who recalls sometimes having nothing to eat but discarded bones from the butcher as a child , was going to skirt what looks a lot like a family curse when he was discovered by the @entity1 in 1982			2
@entity8 was actually a 6 - foot - 7 @entity7 native , but he terrified audiences as an ' @entity62 - inspired ' @entity61 cannibal who often took on legends like @entity4 in the 1980s and the @entity65 in the 1990s			1
his character did n't speak and was accompanied by a keeper named @entity68 ( left ) @entity8 saw great success in the pro wrestling world , but says he was paid only a tiny fraction of his banner name opponents he quickly rose to fame as the silent , shirtless cannibal from afar -- whose 6 - foot - 7 frame and girthy build struck fear in children and adults alike -- accompanied by a man named @entity68			1
that man , whose real name is @entity84 , is the mind behind his @entity34 and book			0
@entity84 believes @entity8 -- who has a 9th grade education -- lost out the soaring salaries of @entity1 headliners like @entity3 and the @entity65 and is now paying the price			1
' if i had been a better talker , if i 'd have known how to negotiate , that probably would 've helped me , ' @entity8 told @entity36			0
today , @entity8 lives on a meager government check following the loss of both his legs to years of diabetes			2
and his wife has recently been laid off from her job of nearly 30 years			0
' i figured @entity8 's story alone in book form could be one answer to lost earnings , ' @entity84 writes on the @entity34 page			2
if written correctly , it could mean great supplemental income for @entity8 for years to come			0
so , i picked up the phone and made the call			0
' @entity8 speaks : in order to right what he sees as a wrong , @entity68 aka @entity84 , decided to try to help @entity8 earn a few bucks by telling his unbelievable life story in a biography old friends : ' many huge wrestling names came together to provide quotes , stories and additional content for this project , to help create an autobiography like you have never read before , ' @entity116 writes in his @entity34 page for the biography project today , the book is done and -- like @entity8 himself -- tries to focus on the positive			1
the biography of @entity8 focuses on , according to @entity84 's @entity34 page : and , as @entity8 says : ' do n't feel sorry for me , if you want to , encourage me			0
i 'm going to be all right â€” just like i 've always been			0
