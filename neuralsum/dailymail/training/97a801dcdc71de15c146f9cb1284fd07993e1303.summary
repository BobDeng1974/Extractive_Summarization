@entity0 was forced to pull into a humiliating climbdown today as the clothing company was forced to pull one of its images from its new ' @entity6 ' campaign			1
the @entity8 firm withdrew the photograph featuring pope @entity10 kissing a senior @entity12 imam on the lips after the @entity14 denounced it as an unacceptable provocation			1
@entity0 had claimed its ' @entity6 ' campaign , which was launched today , was aimed at fostering tolerance and ' global love ' but would have known how much trouble they were likely to stir up			0
the campaign 's adverts include digitally altered pictures half a dozen world leaders to show them kissing			1
controversial : this mocked - up image of the @entity10 embracing @entity27 as part of @entity0 's new advertising campaign has been called ' totally unacceptable ' by the @entity14 edgy : @entity0 's @entity30 includes this picture of @entity33 president @entity32 and @entity35 president @entity34 kissing president @entity32 kisses @entity35 's socialist leader @entity34 , @entity38 prime minister @entity37 locks lips with @entity41 president @entity40 , and @entity43 leader @entity42 also enjoys a smooch with @entity46 president @entity45			1
@entity48 chancellor @entity47 and @entity50 president @entity49 also take time out from dealing with the financial crisis engulfing @entity52 to give each other a smacker			1
but it is the shot of his holiness planting a kiss on @entity62 of @entity65 's @entity64 institute , the pre-eminent theological school of @entity57 , that has raised the strongest objections			2
it been on @entity0 's website all day but was pulled about an hour after the @entity14 's protest			2
@entity64 suspended interfaith talks with the @entity14 earlier this year after @entity10 called for greater protections for @entity12 's minority @entity72			2
mocked - up : @entity48 's chancellor @entity47 in a clinch with @entity50 president @entity49 friendly : this image of @entity78 leader @entity40 and @entity38 prime minister @entity37 kissing will no doubt upset some people in the @entity81 a @entity0 spokesman confirmed this afternoon that the pope - imam ad was no longer part of the campaign			1
images were unfurled in @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 and @entity91 , but a large banner of the image has been removed from a spot near the @entity95			0
@entity14 spokesman the rev. @entity96 called the ad an ' unacceptable ' manipulation of the pope 's likeness that offended the religious sentiments of the faithful			1
' it shows a serious lack of respect for the @entity10 , ' @entity96 said			0
shock ads have long been a part of @entity0 's publicity strategy , with photographer @entity110 's famous campaigns featuring death row inmates and people dying of @entity113			2
combating hatred : @entity0 hope the controversial images will help create tolerance around the world			0
this picture shows @entity120 's leader @entity119 and @entity32 enemies : @entity43 leader @entity42 and @entity45 , president of @entity46 , are unlikely to be keen on this picture @entity123 said the photographs of political and religious leaders kissing were ' symbolic images of reconciliation - with a touch of ironic hope and constructive provocation - to stimulate reflection on how politics , faith and ideas , when they are divergent and mutually opposed , must still lead to dialogue and mediation			1
' in a statement , the @entity138 - based manufacturer said : ' we are sorry that the use of an image of the pontiff and the imam should have offended the sensibilities of the faithful in this way			0
we have decided with immediate effect to withdraw this image from every publication			0
' attention : people look at a @entity0 clothing store window in @entity89 which is covered by posters as part of its new provocative campaign according to the @entity162 , @entity123 , deputy chairman of @entity0 and son of the founder of the family - controlled company , said : ' it means not hating			0
' in a moment of darkness , with the financial crisis , what 's going on in @entity170 countries , in @entity171 , this is an attitude we can all embrace that can have positive energy			0

@entity8 clothing firm 's ad also featured @entity32 kissing @entity34 and @entity47 kissing @entity49
