by @entity0 respecting or learning from one ’s elders is n’t exactly a top priority for most teens			2
they ’re too busy texting or mastering the latest social media platform to relate to the idea that their grandparents ever battled teenage issues like acne or fitting in			0
for @entity14 , though , digging up a previous generation ’s teen scene actually helped her			1
she survived the middle - school blues thanks to @entity18 ’s @entity17 , originally published in 1951			1
her experiences following the guide led @entity21 to write her own book , @entity23 , which has now been optioned for a movie			1
@entity25 , 15 , says her father found @entity28 ’s book in a thrift shop , way before she was born			1
he held onto it for years because its outdated gems like ' beautiful hair is about the most important thing a girl has , ' made him smile			0
mini mogul : @entity14 ( pictured ) followed a 1950s etiquette book for one month in an attempt to draw more friends at school - the results of which she has detailed in a new book , which has recently been optioned for a film the guide surfaced during a clean - up effort and her parents challenged their eighth grade daughter to an idea : follow the book ’s advice in secret and write about what happens			1
@entity25 says she considered herself to be ' one step above substitute teachers ' on her school ’s popularity scale and worried the project would make things worse			1
' it did n’t seem like a good idea at all , ' she recalled in a recent interview			0
' i was terrified because flipping through the pages you read about all teens must wear a girdle and wear pearls to school and wear pantyhose and red lipstick and stuff that i definitely was n’t comfortable doing			2
' cash cow : @entity25 's book , titled @entity23 : a memoir , @entity78 for a @entity79 , was released on april 15 and has already been optioned for a film by @entity81 although she was used to being invisible , as she read the book she had an epiphany			1
' i realized i did want friends and i did want to be liked and i did want to be accepted and while i did n’t have a clear cut definition of popularity , i knew that it was n’t what i was			0
more than anything , i did n’t have anything to lose , so i said , " you know what ? i ’ll try it for a month			0
" ' she began to make changes , wore pearls , dressed up and even tried a girdle			0
little things suggested by @entity28 began to make sense			0
before the popularity guide , @entity25 says she ’d spend five minutes on her hair			1
following the book , she began to put time into her appearance , and a classmate commented that she ’d ' finally dropped the stupid ponytail			0
' some reaction to her new habits was hurtful , but documenting it seemed to help			0
' there were times people would say mean things and it would make me feel really bad , ' confessed @entity25 , who was a 13 - year - old eighth - grader in @entity116 , @entity117 , at the time			2
but writing about them turned them into ' hilarious stories ' where she was ' able to laugh at these things that were genuinely hurtful at first			0
' ' these bullies became characters , and i became a character as well and that was really empowering , ” @entity25 said , adding : “ i would say , " well , what would i want my character to be doing right now ? " ' the original : @entity25 's idea came after reading @entity18 's @entity17 , which shares old - fashioned tips and tricks for 1950s adolescents to become popular besides changing her appearance , @entity28 ’s guide also encouraged @entity25 to reach out to others and be more outgoing			1
as she made connections , kids began to gravitate to her			0
soon she realized , ' everyone around you is like you , and they ’re looking for friendship , and so it ’s good to step up and to be that person , that kind person			2
' as @entity25 ’s experiment was working , her father went to work to track down @entity18 , now in her 80s and living in @entity150 , @entity151 the two met and @entity25 discovered that @entity28 still follows the principles of the book herself			1
' it was wonderful to share that connection			0
she said it was great to have her work validated , ' @entity25 said			2
@entity25 ’s experiment has just been published in a memoir called @entity23 : vintage wisdom for a @entity79 ( @entity161 ) , geared to seventh graders and up			1
@entity18 ’s @entity17 has been re-issued as a companion book , and @entity28 also wrote the forward to @entity23			1
@entity165 also likes @entity25 ’s story : she ’s optioned the movie rights to @entity81			1
@entity25 , now in 10th grade and living with her family in @entity171 , @entity172 , speaks with a confidence and wisdom that seems beyond her years			2
she still breaks out the pearls on special occasions because they ’re ' empowering , ' but there ’s one thing she ’s not keeping : the girdle			0
' i definitely left the girdle in the drawer , ' she said .			0

@entity14 , now 15 , survived middle school with the help of @entity18 ’s @entity17 , originally published in 1951
@entity25 ’s story has now been optioned for a movie
