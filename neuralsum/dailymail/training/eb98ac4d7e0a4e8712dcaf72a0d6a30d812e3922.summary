swell : deeper colours show wind gaining speed around @entity8 , causing huge waves at the shore the forecaster said that as storms pass to the north of @entity176 the large , prominent land mass acts almost like an aircraft wing , creating an area of higher speed winds flowing to the east around the tip. this wind pattern builds energy into swells and points itself directly at @entity8			1
mr @entity152 added : ' the same storms that create these colossal swells tend to march over the land as the waves arrive , so a typical swell is accompanied by extremely strong winds			0
