at 16 years of age , @entity0 is a @entity2 player and earning a reported £ 80,000 per week			1
the boy done good , you might just about say			1
what comes next ? we hope his undeniable talent bears fruit at @entity2 and he becomes a global great			1
theoretically , though , @entity0 could put his feet up and still become a millionaire many , many times over			1
plenty of teen prodigies have come before and failed to live up to the hype			1
the spotlight proves too much or the ability turns out to have been exaggerated			1
considering @entity2 ’s outlay and the esteem @entity0 holds among the likes of @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23 , the signals suggest he will continue his path to glory			1
as a cautionary tale , however , @entity26 looks at some of those who fell short of expectations			1
@entity31 teenage sensation @entity0 has agreed a deal to join @entity2 @entity33 the ultimate story of unfulfilled promise perhaps			1
that is not to sound like schadenfreude , simply an assessment of how a dream lost lustre in reality			1
at 14 , @entity33 was the youngest athlete to sign a professional contract in @entity44 sport when drafted by @entity45			1
he was twice named in the @entity46 all - star team and expected to lead his nation at @entity48			1
having had a trial with @entity50 , he eventually arrived in @entity51 at @entity52			1
that did not go well , nor spells at @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 or @entity57			1
his work - rate was questioned and his career bottomed out when struggling @entity60 failed to find cause to give him a deal a year ago			1
now 25 , he is without a club having seen a six - month contract with @entity69 outfit @entity67 end			2
he does have nearly 400,000 followers on @entity71 , mind			2
@entity33 was the youngest person to sign a professional contract in @entity44 sport when drafted aged 14 @entity33 was expected to lead the @entity44 for the foreseeable future but failed to realise his potential @entity33 had a trial with @entity50 in 2006 ( left ) and moved to @entity51 with @entity52 @entity78 most famous among computer gamers for being a cast - iron success on @entity82 , @entity78 ’s real - life exploits were as solid only as mercury			1
born in @entity84 , he came to @entity85 at an early age and performed with such style for @entity88 that the club rejected a £ 2million offer from @entity22 under @entity91			2
he played for every @entity85 youth level up to @entity93 , but his talent failed to keep pace with his ego and in 2004 he was released by @entity88 , beginning a tour of football ’s lesser lights			2
time at @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 , @entity104 and @entity105 came and went			2
he did play for @entity84 ’s senior side , even scoring once , but now aged 29 is unattached			2
@entity84 - born @entity78 in action for @entity85 under 16s against @entity109 @entity110 probably football ’s clearest fable , a byword for the pitfalls that can afflict young talent			2
born in @entity116 , @entity110 was voted player of the tournament in the 1991 @entity119 featuring @entity121 's @entity120 and @entity123 's @entity122			1
@entity124 hailed @entity110 his natural heir			2
@entity126 brought him to @entity51 and the @entity128 @entity127 changed rules so he could play in the club ’s first team aged 16			1
he got a goal on his @entity134 debut and was top scorer in @entity136 when he moved to @entity137			1
@entity138 signed him for @entity139 and @entity140 but @entity110 failed to shine as anticipated and his star drifted south			2
he tried seven different countries to resurrect his career but failed			2
' when @entity124 said i could go on to become like him , it was a great honour for me , ' @entity110 has said			2
‘ but it had its negative side - everywhere i went i was supposed to live up to very high standards			2
once i could n't meet people 's expectations , i was considered a failure			1
' @entity116 midfielder @entity110 felt weighed down by comparisons with @entity153 great @entity124 @entity154 on the @entity156 show @entity154 the nephew of former @entity159 striker @entity158 hit the headlines aged seven when @entity161 plucked him from @entity163 ’s youth team in the early 90s			2
dressed in the kit of the @entity166 giants and with long , flowing hair , he took part in a curious segment with @entity170 and @entity171 on their @entity156 show to discuss his ambitions			1
but the pressure of top - level football affected him mentally and he required therapy , before quitting the game for good in 2003			1
he went on to study psychology at @entity179 in pursuit of a ‘ normal ’ life			2
@entity182 more than words , the photograph that emerged in january 2013 of this once cult hero told @entity182 ’s story			2
the face podgy , the eyes sad , his picture captured on a night out led to the revelation his £ 25,000 - per - week contract with @entity193 had been cancelled and his career effectively over at 25			0
@entity195 said he would be an @entity85 star			0
others called him the new @entity197			0
severe injuries which led to a lax physical condition put paid to those hopes			0
a city academy graduate and local lad , he excited fans during the 2007 - 08 campaign with two goals in 25 lung - busting displays			0
abdominal and knee injuries curtailed his ‘ big talent ’ – the words of @entity214 – and he made just four appearances for @entity193 in his final five seasons			1
@entity182 pictured in january 2013 on a night out as his @entity193 career fell apart @entity195 and @entity214 were full of praise for @entity182 , but his @entity193 contract was cancelled @entity218 introduced himself to the @entity220 aged 17 with a stunning goal to win a dramatic game against @entity139 in the final minute and get @entity50 ’s 2008 - 09 title bid back on track			0
on the brink of losing a third consecutive match , @entity218 sent a curling shot past @entity228			0
he scored the winner against @entity230 in his next league match too , setting up his promise – but subsequently failed to make a genuine impact			0
loan spells at @entity235 , @entity236 , @entity237 and @entity238 hardly inspired , before a slight bounce at @entity240			0
now aged 23 , he is on @entity242 ’s books and looking to build his career			0
@entity218 announced his arrival in 2009 with a goal that swung the title pendulum in @entity45 's favour @entity218 has had a number of loan spells , including @entity238 ( above ) , and is now on the books at @entity242 @entity251 the one all @entity253 followers know well			1
signed for £ 9m in 2009 as the club ’s @entity255 owners rolled the dice , @entity251 arrived with pedigree as a @entity259 under 21 international			0
but he failed to score in a spell that was curtailed after six months with @entity261 spending less than a third of the fee @entity253 had paid			0
@entity264 later investigated the transfer			0
@entity251 never played for the @entity123 , and flopped at six clubs on loan , ending up at @entity268 in @entity269			1
in late 2012 , he was arrested in the @entity271 resort of @entity272 on a false kidnap claim , having reportedly attempted to extort money from his family as ransom			0
previously , at @entity277 , @entity251 was reported missing after going awol from training			0
@entity280 later joined the search			0
@entity251 turned up , but the talent which had convinced @entity253 to splash the cash was never found			0
@entity251 arrived at @entity253 with a big reputation in 2009 but left six months later @entity285 the @entity153 made a name for himself at @entity288 with his ‘ seal dribble ’ – nodding the ball with his head while running at opponents			1
some found it disrespectful , @entity295 decided to bring him to serie a. it did not go to plan			0
injuries curtailed his opportunities and set off a nomadic journey , sparked by @entity300 sending him to @entity161			0
he had a reasonably successful spell with @entity304 – a lowly @entity306 team – before moving to @entity307 in @entity308			0
still aged just 26 , it is not the outpost expected when starring for @entity312 ’s @entity311			0
@entity285 was brought to @entity313 by @entity295 from @entity288 in 2008 but failed to make his mark in @entity51 @entity315 it may seem harsh to include the @entity317 on a list of failed prodigies , but given he laid claim to being one of the world ’s best strikers from a young age the gauge is set to a higher configuration			1
having made his @entity328 debut aged 17 - a decade ago now – we are still left wondering where the confidence came from to make his bold statement			0
@entity315 joined @entity334 on a free after @entity335 tried for numerous seasons to offload a player who was , somehow , on £ 50,000 per week			0
the numbers show he scored 45 goals in 171 games during his time at @entity23 , hardly elite standard , and then there was the hellraiser attitude – topped when he was arrested for smashing windows in a gym at his luxury apartment complex			0
@entity315 never lived up to his claim of being one of the world 's leading strikers at @entity23 @entity352 a man whose terrace chant far outweighs his on - field activities			1
hailed by @entity45 fans as the ‘ midfield magician who s * * * * on @entity358 ’ following his early performances in a red shirt – notably at @entity361 in december 2007 when @entity362 got the runaround – he now can not even find a club to sign him			0
it looked so special when signed for £ 20m from @entity366 aged 19			0
he scored a penalty full of character in the 2008 @entity371 final shootout against @entity372			0
but an alleged fondness for fast food has led to fitness problems and he will leave @entity376 this summer , at the latest , having never redeemed the adulation			0
@entity50 paid £ 20million to bring @entity352 to @entity376 from @entity366 in 2007 @entity352 in action against @entity358 of @entity23 in 2009 at the @entity379			0
