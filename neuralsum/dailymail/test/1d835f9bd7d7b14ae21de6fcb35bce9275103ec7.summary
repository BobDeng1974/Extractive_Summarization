book of the week @entity1 in paradise : @entity3 , @entity4 and spruce in the amazon by @entity7 back in 1961 three young @entity10 graduates set off to explore the @entity11 in a remote part of the @entity13			1
one of them , @entity15 , became the last @entity16 to be killed by an uncontacted tribe , when he was murdered with bows and arrows			2
the second , @entity21 , went on to manage @entity22			2
but for the third , @entity7 , the trip was the beginning of a lifelong fascination with the region , and a distinguished career writing about it			2
bird of paradise : a musician wren more than 50 years on , that same fascination still shines out of every page of @entity34 , the compelling story of an earlier trio of young @entity38 explorers			1
at first sight - and several subsequent ones - ' paradise ' might n't seem the obvious word to describe the @entity42 in the mid 19th century			2
a huge anti-government uprising had destroyed much of whatever infrastructure there had been			2
river transport , the only kind available , still relied on getting the local @entity48 to do the paddling - or , when faced with waterfalls and rapids , the heavy lifting			2
flooding could cause chunks of land , some of several acres , to come hurtling down the river , smashing everything in their way			2
and of course , there was a spectacular array of biting and stinging insects - including mosquitoes , which nobody had yet linked to malaria			2
nonetheless , for naturalists as driven as @entity3 , @entity67 and @entity68 , a paradise is exactly what the @entity13 was			1
even after being attacked by a particularly nasty species of wasp , @entity68 wrote of his admiration for ' their beauty , ingenuity and heroic ferocity '			1
these days , the image of 19th - century @entity38 travellers is perhaps of public - school types airily bossing the natives about , possibly from a sedan chair			1
well , not in this case - because @entity3 , @entity67 and @entity68 were all classic examples of @entity85 self - improvement			1
none was from a rich family and none went to school beyond 14			0
all , however , soon set about the urgent task of educating themselves			2
at 15 , @entity67 was working 13 hours a day , six days a week , as a hosiery apprentice			1
fortunately , that did n't prevent him from learning @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity97 at the local @entity98 in @entity99 , or from developing a passion for natural history			0
naturalist @entity68 the young @entity3 loved nothing better than to curl up with the poetry of @entity104 or @entity105 - until he discovered the joys of plant classification			1
aged 17 , @entity68 carefully listed 403 species of plants near his @entity111 home , before surrendering to the seemingly irresistible appeal of mosses and liverworts			1
when @entity3 and @entity67 met in @entity99 in 1844 , apparently at the public library , they immediately realised they were kindred spirits			1
four years later , still in their early 20s and having found a @entity121 agent to sell any specimens they sent back , they sailed to @entity124 , which was already recognised as an ecological treasure - trove			1
in fact , after a few months together , the pair amicably separated			0
( @entity67 preferred to stay in one place for months at a time , while @entity3 liked to go wherever his more impulsive nose led him			1
) a year later , @entity68 arrived to begin his own @entity13 adventures , bumping into the others only occasionally			1
what followed was a story - or three stories - of quietly stirring heroism			0
sad to say , in the port of @entity138 where they landed , the biggest difference from @entity16 that @entity3 and @entity67 noticed was the comparative lack of drunkenness			1
once they headed inland , though , they were in another world entirely			0
they were also among people either puzzled or amused that they had come so far just to collect some plants and animals			0
in general , the @entity48 proved remarkably hospitable , as well as astonishingly skilful boatmen			0
not all tribal traditions were to @entity16 tastes - including the one where the dead were buried in the village 's huts , dug up a month later , cooked , pounded into a powder , mixed with alcohol and drunk by the assembled company			0
the @entity159 locals , meanwhile , were a distinctly mixed bunch			0
in one village , @entity67 was amazed to come across a man whose mud - hut contained a library of well - thumbed @entity95 classics			1
in another , @entity3 was both shocked and delighted by a cheerfully dissolute priest			1
as an @entity13 explorer himself , @entity7 describes the endless hardships almost matter - of - factly , which only makes it clearer how hair - raising they were			0
even so , when it comes to understatement , he 's still no match for the three @entity178			0
after @entity3 shot part of his own hand off , he confessed to feeling ' rather miserable '			1
later , he described the ants eating him alive as ' not the most agreeable companions '			0
above all , though , these men collected : gathering specimens of every conceivable type , no matter what condition they were in			0
' with bleeding feet and an empty stomach , i found the journey sufficiently toilsome , ' wrote @entity68 of one trip			1
' but this did not prevent me gathering plants ' - although , on a wimpier note , when he was ' near dying of hunger ' he did collect only in the afternoons			0
then there was the equally tricky business of preserving the specimens in wet jungle conditions until they could be packaged up for the journey to @entity121			0
as @entity7 emphasises , it 's almost miraculous that so much of what the three collected made it back in such good condition			0
@entity67 alone managed to send 14,712 species , with the number of specimens naturally far higher			1
the biggest loss , in fact , came when the boat on which @entity3 was travelling home in 1852 caught fire , destroying his notebooks and the live animals he 'd brought with him			1
happily , he was rescued after only a week in an open boat 700 miles from land			0
a lesser man might well have been discouraged by the experience			0
yet within two years , @entity3 was off again , this time for eight years of collecting in @entity220			1
there , he also developed a theory of natural selection that @entity224 realised was virtually the same as the one he himself had been sitting on for two decades - and so quickly set about writing @entity226			2
' i could never have approached the completeness of his book , ' @entity3 generously declared when it was published			2
meanwhile , back in @entity231 , @entity67 and @entity68 were still collecting away ... @entity7 tells the story of this extraordinary trio without hype , wisely content to let the facts and their own reflections speak largely for themselves			1
he does , however , add the occasional telling update : we learn that some of the tribes that helped the three men are sadly now extinct			0
but perhaps the most striking moment of all comes with a short footnote on page 106 that reminds us how much the world has changed			0
having sailed through a series of thunderstorms , @entity68 gets separated from his companions on a jungle trek and fears he 's going to die			2
but then , deep in the lonely forest , he hears something he 's long dreamed of hearing : a musician wren , which sings like a music box			0
' modern readers , ' the footnote reads , ' can hear this bird by visiting www.xeno-canto.org and searching for “ musician wren ”			0
i guarantee that it will brighten your day .			0
