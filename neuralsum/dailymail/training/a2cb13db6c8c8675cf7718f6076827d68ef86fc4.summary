by @entity0 ever had a funny feeling that someone was not being totally honest with you ? that gut instinct is probably worth following as it is better at spotting liars than our conscious mind , said researchers			1
automatic associations can be more helpful as logical awareness may hinder our ability to detect fraud , they added			1
researchers found that when it comes to detecting deceit ( illustrated ) , automatic associations - or using your ' gut instinct ' - may be more accurate than conscious thought in helping humans sort truths and lies			1
the study suggests that conscious awareness may actually hinder our ability to detect whether someone is lying this could be because we tend to seek out behaviour supposedly typical of liars , such as averted eyes or fidgeting			1
study author dr @entity29 said : ‘ our research was prompted by the puzzling but consistent finding that humans are very poor lie detectors , performing at only about 54 per cent accuracy			1
’ she said that figure is barely better than simply guessing if someone is lying			2
the psychological scientist added : ‘ we set out to test whether the unconscious mind could catch a liar – even when the conscious mind failed			1
’ for the project at the @entity43 , 72 subjects watched videos of ‘ suspects ’ in a mock - crime interview			1
some had stolen a 100 dollar bill from a bookshelf while others were innocent			0
however , all claimed they had not taken the money , meaning one group was lying , reported the journal @entity54			2
when asked , the subjects only correctly picked the liars 43 per cent of the time and the truth - tellers 48 per cent of the time			1
but the researchers had also employed widely - used behavioural reaction time tests to examine more intuitive reactions			2
@entity63 these results showed that participants were more likely to unconsciously associate deception - related words – such as untruthful , dishonest and deceitful – with the liars			2
the subjects were more likely to associate truthful words – such as honest or valid – with the suspects who were being straight			0
a second experiment backed the findings that our intuitive sense helps detect lying			1
the finding seems at odds with the fact that people are typically sensitive to how others are feeling , what they are thinking and what their personalities are like			0
dr @entity84 hypothesised that the findings may be accounted for by unconscious processes			0
‘ we set out to test whether the unconscious mind could catch a liar - even when the conscious mind failed , ’ she said			2
in the experiment , researchers made 72 people watch videos of ‘ suspects ’ in a mock - crime interview			1
some of the suspects in the videos had ' stolen ' a $ 100 bill from a bookshelf , whereas others had not			0
however , all of the suspects were instructed to tell the interviewer they had not stolen the money			0
when the 72 participants were asked to say which suspects they thought were lying and which were telling the truth , they were only able to detect liars 43 per cent of the time and those telling the truth only 48 per cent of the time			1
however , the researchers also used behavioural reaction time tests - one of which is called the @entity120 ( @entity120 ) - to probe participants ' more automatic instincts towards the suspects			2
results showed that participants were more likely to unconsciously associate deception - related words - such as ‘ untruthful ’ , ‘ dishonest ’ , and ‘ deceitful ’ with the suspects who were actually lying			1
at the same time , the participants were more likely to associate truthful words - such as ‘ honest ’ or ‘ valid , ’ with the suspects who were actually telling the truth			1
a second experiment suggests that people may have some intuitive sense , outside of conscious awareness , that detects when someone is lying			1
dr @entity84 said : ‘ these results provide a new lens through which to examine social perception and suggest that - at least in terms of detection of lies - unconscious measures may provide additional insight into interpersonal accuracy			2
’ researchers from @entity148 have discovered our brains carry out different process when we hear genuine laughter compared to fake chuckles			0
when laughter is forced , for example , it activates a part of the brain linked with deciphering emotions			0
this means we know it 's not a genuine laugh , and we automatically try to work out why they 're faking it , what the laugh means and what the they 're thinking			0
while genuine laughter lights up areas of the brain linked with happiness and positive emotions			0
to test the theory , psychologist dr @entity173 from the @entity174 measured brain responses of volunteers as they listened to genuine laughter on @entity178 clips			0
each participant was asked to pick clips they found funny			0
this ranged from comedy shows , such as @entity183 , and even the @entity184			0
the results were then compared to how their brains responded to fake laughter			0
the findings revealed participants , none of which were told the study was about laughter perception , could unconsciously tell when the chuckles were insincere .			0

a psychological scientist from the @entity43 found humans are very poor lie detectors unless they used ' automatic associations '
experiment participants were only able to detect liars 43 *%* of the time and fared better when using their ‘ gut ’ instinct
people may have an intuitive sense , outside of conscious awareness , that detects when someone is lying - although what this is , is not understood
