by @entity0 last updated at 10:15 pm on 31st january 2012 the ' amputee victim ' in a controversial ad warning against the dangers of drinking too many sugary drinks - who actually has two normal legs - has revealed his shock at seeing himself in the campaign			1
@entity9 , 27 , of @entity10 , @entity11 , is shown in a hard - hitting @entity13 advert about an overweight man who lost a leg below the knee because too many fizzy drinks led to an amputation			1
but mr @entity9 , who was paid $ 500 to pose for photos in a studio in @entity21 , @entity13 , several years ago , said he was in tears for a whole minute when he saw himself in the advert last week			1
‘ i was beyond shocked , ’ mr @entity9 told the @entity32			1
‘ i cried at my computer screen for , like , a minute			0
i said : “ oh my gosh , they even gave me crutches			2
come on , people ”			0
no amputation : the original picture of mr @entity9 from a photo agency shows he has both legs intact ‘ i ’ve always wanted my photo in an ad all over the city , but i was hoping it would be for a tv show or something , not this , ’ he added , saying he would now like to do a commercial for a fizzy drinks firm			1
after the advert was released it emerged that the man featured in the ad - which then turned out to be mr @entity9 - actually has two legs and one of them was edited out by the advertising agency			1
the actor told the @entity32 he is happy for the city to educate people on diabetes , but was not impressed by their use of an edited image of someone who was not a real victim of the disease			2
mr @entity9 's @entity69 film profile reveals he was in an episode of the tv series @entity72 last year , called out of the @entity73			2
he has also been in short films and was a stunt man in ‘ @entity76 ’			0
@entity13 's health department confirmed that his leg was removed to make the point of the campaign			1
the photo came from a company that supplies stock images to advertising firms			2
but city officials were slammed for not revealing that he was not a real amputee victim and did not have diabetes			0
the photographer who took the picture , @entity88 , did not know mr @entity9			2
mr @entity88 told the @entity32 last week that he had not seen the advertisement but said of it : ' well , it is an illustration now , clearly not the picture i did			0
' when the adverts were released earlier this month , fizzy drink manufacturers were quick to attack it , saying it painted an ' inaccurate picture ' of what the beverage does to the body			0
@entity103 : the health agency insists that another anti-smoking campaign featuring a woman called @entity107 from the @entity108 was a true - life portrayal of someone who had their finger tips amputated because of smoking true : they also insisted the man with the voice box is a real - life throat cancer victim but @entity13 health chiefs - and mayor @entity120 - insist it is a necessary shock tactic			1
they said that in 2006 , almost 3,000 @entity13 with diabetes were hospitalised for amputations			1
more than 1,000 of the posters were put up in subways across the city			0
but @entity127 , a spokesman for the @entity128 , said the campaign was over the top			0
' instead of utilising scare tactics , the beverage industry is offering real solutions like smaller portioned containers and new calorie labels , ’ mr @entity127 said			0
but in a press conference mr @entity120 said : ' what do you want to do ? do you want to have people lose their legs ? or do you want to show them what happens so that they wo n't lose their legs ? ’ other city ads feature a smoker who developed throat cancer at 39 and now has to talk through a voice box and a woman called @entity107 who had the ends of her fingers amputated because of smoking			0
also seen : another ad shows an obese woman dragging herself up a set of stairs as she clings to the handrail over a graphic of how much bigger portions of fries have become defence : @entity13 health chiefs - and mayor @entity120 , pictured - insist it is a necessary shock tactic			1
they said that in 2006 , almost 3,000 @entity13 with diabetes were hospitalised for amputations ‘ this issue is n’t about one actor but rather the 700,000 @entity13 who struggle with diabetes , which kills 1,700 people a year , ’ a health department spokesman told the @entity32			1
' i was beyond shocked			0
i cried at my computer screen for , like , a minute			0
i said : " oh my gosh , they even gave me crutches			0
come on , people " ' @entity9 , advert model ‘ and ( it ) causes amputations in another 3,000 , ’ he added			2
‘ advertising to warn the public about health concerns saves lives , and we will continue our efforts to warn @entity13 about diabetes			1
’ @entity13 is one of the most forthright places in the @entity190 when policing the health of citizens			1
mayor @entity120 has already banned smoking in public places like parks and beaches			0
adverts already running on the @entity13 subway show how many miles a person would have to walk to work off the calories from fatty kinds of coffees			1
@entity13 have also been forced to look at an anti-obesity advert showing people drinking a glass full of human fat to dissuade them from eating junk food .			2

@entity9 , 27 , of @entity10 , @entity11 , posed for photo years ago
but he found himself amputated and given crutches for @entity13 health ad
