it 's an age - old worry for the men the world over			0
now , however , scientists have revealed what 's considered ' normal ' for penis size and length			2
the average length of an erect penis is 5.2 inches ( 13.12 cm ) , they found			1
meanwhile , the average length of a flaccid penis is 3.6 inches ( 9.16 cm ) and 5.2 inches ( 13.24 cm ) when flaccid but stretched			1
and when it comes to girth , the average erect circumference was 4.6 inches ( 11.66 cm ) and 3.7 inches ( 9.31 cm ) when flaccid			1
the @entity14 research also found there was a small correlation between the erect length of a penis and a man 's height			1
the average length of a flaccid penis is 3.6 inches ( 9.16 cm ) and 5.2 inches ( 13.24 cm ) when flaccid but stretched , the researchers found ( file photo ) the researchers say the graphs they have plotted , which show the size distributions of a penis , will help clinicians dealing with @entity29 ( @entity29 ) , a serious anxiety disorder relating to body image			1
the study could help to counsel men worried about their size , or with investigations into how condom failure relates to penis size and girth			2
some men are concerned about their penis size , and those who are preoccupied and severely distressed may even be diagnosed with @entity29			1
the researchers created a graph ( or a nomogram ) depicting the size distributions of penis ' among men of all ages and many races			1
the research included 17 studies of 15,521 men who underwent penis size measurements by health professionals using a standard procedure			2
before this research , there had been no formal systematic reviews of these measurements , and no attempt to create a nomogram showing the distribution of size			2
lead author dr @entity60 from the @entity61 ( @entity62 ) , @entity63 and @entity64 and @entity65 , told @entity66 : ' men compare themselves in locker rooms and with pornography on the internet and believe they are inferior			0
' some men have been teased by sexual partners about their length			0
' there are lots of men who might be worried - and we think reassuring men they are in the normal range will help			0
' we will also use the graphs to examine the discrepancy between what a man believes to be their position on the graph and their actual position , or what they think they should be			0
' we have a specialist @entity93 and some men are very worried and distressed about their size			0
experts plotted graphs showing the size distribution of the length of the average penis when flaccid , flaccid and stretched and erect			1
the graph above shows average penis length of men - in centimetres - in each percentile the researchers also plotted a nomogram showing the size distribution of the girth of the average penis			1
the graph shows the average penis girth of men in each percentile - again in centimetres ' they are unlikely to be helped just by looking at a size distribution graph , they will need more formal treatment like @entity119 or medication too			1
' dr @entity121 , medical director at @entity64 and @entity65 , said : ' @entity29 causes a person to have a distorted view of how they look and they can spend an obsessive amount of time worrying about their appearance			0
' this can include worries over their weight , specific parts of their body and , for men , the size of their penis			0
' this can take over someone 's life and cause a great deal of distress			0
' hopefully this new study will help reassure those many men who are concerned with their penis size and assist clinicians dealing with @entity29			2
' ' @entity29 occurs alongside @entity147 ( @entity147 ) and a person with @entity29 may constantly compare their looks to other people 's , spend a long time in front of the mirror or avoid the mirror altogether , constantly conceal a perceived defect or feel anxious when around other people or in social situations			0
' the research was published in the @entity158 ( @entity158 ) .			0

experts have created graphs showing the size distributions of a penis
the average flaccid penis is 3.6 inches ( 9.16 cm ) , the research shows
this extends to 5.2 inches ( 13.24 cm ) when stretched but still flaccid
researchers found a small correlation between height and penis length
graphs could help *doctors* treating @entity29 , say experts
