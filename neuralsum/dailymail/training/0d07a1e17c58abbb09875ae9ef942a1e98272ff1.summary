so it turns out that the smartest folk in town this week were those at @entity5 sports newspaper @entity4			1
they were the ones who suggested as early as monday morning that @entity8 were about to come to the @entity9 and stick their reserves out			1
nobody believed the story but in the end they were right , which prompts a question for @entity8 supporters			1
what is more worrying — the fact that your manager ’s team plans are being leaked to the press in your opponent ’s home town or that he should make a decision laced with such staggering lack of ambition in the first place ? @entity30 applauds the travelling fans at full time after @entity8 's defeat by @entity5 @entity33 ( left ) started the game on the bench and came on as a sub for @entity37 @entity38 ( left , tussling with @entity39 ) was another star who started on the bench @entity30 decided to makes seven changes for tuesday night 's clash against @entity5			1
only @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45 survived from the 1 - 0 defeat to @entity47 at the weekend			1
@entity8 starting @entity48 v @entity47 : @entity42 , @entity49 , @entity43 , @entity50 , @entity44 , @entity38 , @entity45 , @entity33 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 @entity8 starting @entity48 v @entity5 : @entity42 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity43 , @entity44 ; can , @entity37 7 ; @entity56 , @entity45 , @entity57 ; @entity58 most of those standing flummoxed in the away section high up in the gods here last night were perhaps past caring about the small details by kick off			1
the decision had been made and @entity8 , as a result , were finished before they even began			1
this was sport , but only in name			0
it is hard to win at @entity5			1
since 1957 , only one @entity72 team apart from @entity8 has managed it			1
the key fact here , though , is that the others have come to this magnificent stadium and tried			0
to return to an earlier point , that is called sport			0
you turn up , take a deep breath , put your gloves on or your shin pads and you go out and try to do something special			0
@entity86 tried with @entity87 here in 1973 and got a draw			0
@entity90 lost 5 - 1 with @entity91 after winning a @entity93 first leg 4 - 1			2
he went home with a broken heart and a sense of injustice but at least he tried , just as @entity98 did in losing 3 - 2 with @entity99 in 2001			2
@entity100 celebrates scoring for @entity74 during a 1 - 0 win at the @entity9 in 2006 @entity102 ( right ) celebrates scoring what proved to be the winning goal for @entity5 @entity55 ( left ) holds off @entity102 in what was an impressive display by the @entity8 defender click here for @entity110 ratings from the @entity9 to find out how the surprise @entity8 starters fared his team led that night			1
only for a minute , but just imagine what that minute must have felt like			0
we could talk about narrow failures here for both @entity118 teams			0
@entity8 manager @entity30 can dress this team selection up all he likes			1
he can call it pragmatic or realistic but it is neither of those things , really			0
it just felt fundamentally wrong and the fact that the defeat was narrow and the performance spirited does not change that			0
the result should not serve as vindication of @entity30 ’ methods			2
the scoreline was a fluke , reflective not of @entity5 ’s clear dominance but of the fact that @entity8 ’s lack of competitiveness almost sent their opponents to sleep			1
@entity138 ( right ) was a surprise starter for @entity8 but failed to impress in @entity5 @entity58 started up front for @entity8 in place of @entity53 137 - the seven players on the @entity8 bench had made 137 @entity93 appearances between them prior to kick - off last night			1
that ’s seven more than the number made by the players in their starting @entity48 130 - the number of @entity93 appearances made by @entity8 ’s starting @entity48 642 - the number of @entity93 appearances made by @entity5 ’s starting @entity48 £ 59 - the cost of an away ticket at @entity9 last night			1
not to mention the added cost of flights and hotels			0
27 - shots at goal by @entity5 last night			1
that ’s 13 more than they managed in their 3 - 0 win at @entity161			1
2 - minutes played by @entity33 at the @entity9 prior to last night			2
he was a sub in a 1 - 0 win in 2009			1
he has now played a total of 23 minutes at the stadium			0
3,669 - tickets at the @entity9 allocated to @entity8 fans			1
@entity30 ’ team selection will have disappointed many who made the 1,796 - mile round - trip			1
the game was played in an almost dreamlike atmosphere , as though @entity5 knew they would win			2
when they scored , in the 27th minute , the roof hardly came off the place			2
by half - time , @entity5 had taken 13 shots on goal to @entity8 ’s none			1
that is not what we hoped for when the draw threw these two great clubs together			0
afterwards , @entity30 ’ stated belief in his own methods was impressive enough			2
it is a relevant quality			0
he has not done much wrong since arriving at @entity161 two summers ago but this selection flew quite spectacularly in the face of all he has preached			0
back then he talked romantically about sitting on the floor of his grandfather ’s house watching great @entity8 @entity195 nights on tv			2
what he will not have watched is @entity198 sending his stiffs out			0
back then they did n’t even get on the plane , never mind the pitch			0
@entity5 are a very good football team			1
they were not the best team in @entity204 last season , though			2
or , indeed , the second best			0
they lost five times , including twice at home			0
@entity30 made seven changes to the team that started on the weekend against @entity47 @entity56 ( centre ) grew into the game as it went on and justified his starting place they have improved since then and were far too good for @entity8 two weeks ago			1
in @entity30 ’ mind , though , they have been clearly been built up in to a monster			2
he obviously believes them to be unbeatable and perhaps that is the greatest sin of all			0
no manager — in any sport — should ever think that			0
if we all thought that way , we may as well scrap the @entity224			0
this was , in effect , a team selection designed principally to avoid collateral damage that may affect an entirely different game — against @entity230 in the @entity231 — that is still three days away			0
and if that is the way a manager thinks , what chance do his players have ? results can change seasons			0
who knows ? for @entity8 , this could have been the one			2
@entity8 fans who traveled to the @entity9 may question @entity30 ' decision to play a weakened team @entity246 ( centre ) rises to collect a cross and deny @entity39 an effort at goal instead , @entity8 now look like a team who feel they do n’t belong in @entity253 , a team who arrive at the really big venues seeking purely to avoid a hiding			1
@entity30 , meanwhile , must wait and see what this does for his own reputation — even if he claimed last night not to care			1
just two weeks ago , the @entity8 manager told another @entity204 newspaper — @entity263 — that he would like to work over here one day			2
he may be waiting a while after this			0
video we did n't need to play with intensity - @entity267			0

@entity30 made seven changes from the team that started against @entity47
@entity8 *battled* well but scoreline *flattered* them as @entity5 were better team
@entity30 must to wait and see whether decision has damaged reputation
@entity102 scored the only goal as @entity5 ran out 1 - 0 winners
