by @entity0 former deputy speaker @entity1 , who now sits as an independent mp , denies all charges former commons deputy speaker @entity1 should not be convicted of rape just to ‘ salve the conscience ’ of a man who regrets having sex with him , a jury was told yesterday			1
a 22 - year - old politics student who claimed the mp assaulted him after a dinner party had in reality given ‘ every indication of consent ’ , said @entity14 , representing @entity1			1
‘ in the cold light of day , the complainant may regret what had taken place and how far it had actually gone , but such sentiments are some considerable distance removed from an incident of sexual assault and rape , ’ he told @entity15			2
‘ salving his conscience is not the basis on which to convict a man of rape and sexual assault			0
’ the former @entity29 mp , who now sits as an independent , is accused by the prosecution of using his influence at @entity33 to target politically ambitious young men , knowing they would not complain about his advances			0
@entity1 admits having sex with the student but insists the young man – who admits he never said ‘ no ’ – appeared to be an entirely willing participant			2
mr @entity40 also said that two incidents in 2003 when men claim that the 56 - year - old mp tried to put his hands down their trousers – one in a @entity48 bar , one at the @entity29 conference in @entity50 – did not support the prosecution case of a politician abusing his influence			1
‘ they are a high watermark of over-friendly , inappropriate behaviour by a drunken man , rather than the ingredients of an indecent assault , ’ he added			0
@entity1 is also accused of trying to kiss a 21 - year - old gay man in 2009 and grabbing a heterosexual man between the legs the following year , both at the @entity62 ’ bar at the @entity33			1
mr @entity1 's lawyer told @entity15 that the allegation were motivated by the claimant 's regret but mr @entity40 said police learnt of both complainants from another of the alleged victims , a bisexual man who claims @entity1 assaulted him while he slept on the sofa of his constituency home in @entity76 in 2009			1
the barrister said this complainant gave police details of these alleged incidents to ‘ bolster ’ his account but had initially mixed the pair up			0
he said the version given in court by the man allegedly grabbed between the legs bore ‘ little resemblance ’ to what he told police			0
meanwhile , the bisexual man ’s account ‘ does not sit comfortably ’ with the fact he continued socialising with @entity1 afterwards			2
the mp denies all the charges			0

former deputy speaker @entity1 faces nine charges , including rape
the mp 's lawyer said the claimant gave ' every indication of consent '
@entity14 told @entity15 the allegations were motivated by the claimant 's regrets of having slept with @entity1
@entity1 admits having sex with the 22 - year - old but claims it was *consensual*
