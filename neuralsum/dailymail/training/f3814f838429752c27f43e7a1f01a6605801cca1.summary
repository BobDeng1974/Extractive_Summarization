@entity1 's @entity0 can already provide a soundtrack during your daily commute and distract you with a book , movie or game , but now the tech giant wants to make it easier for you to get where you 're going			1
a @entity12 patent application submitted by @entity1 shows that the @entity14 - based company has been developing a new ' @entity15 ' to give up - to - the minute travel information			1
the new service would appear as an app on @entity1 's devices to help commuters find the best way to make their journey by public transport			1
@entity1 's patent shows it has been developing an entirely new service dedicated to helping commuters			1
it wants to produce a one - stop app that will fulfill all of a users ' commuting needs by providing a rolling list of bus and train travel times , routes , stops , route changes and delays while there are already many third - party apps available for the @entity0 , few seem to have the scope or ambition of @entity1 's proposed service			1
it wants to produce a one - stop app that will fulfill all of a users ' commuting needs by providing a rolling list of bus and train travel times , routes , stops , route changes and delays			2
@entity1 has revealed plans to develop a new system that fires laser beams from its iphones			2
but rather using it like a science fiction weapon , @entity1 wants to use the new feature to enable its phones to map their surroundings			0
the laser would be mounted inside the @entity0 and used together with the inbuilt motion sensors to generate a map of any surface it is pointed at			0
an @entity0 - mounted sensor would detect any light bounced back to the device and provide information about the surfaces of objects around it			1
this would allow the @entity0 to be used to measure distance and create 3d maps of rooms and even buildings - something that currently requires bulky equipment			0
it could even be used in conjunction with 3d printers to create replicate a users favourite knickknack			0
for those with more exotic modes of transport in mind , the patent even mentions the service could include boats , airplanes and helicopters			2
@entity1 said it will pull together information from different transport networks in an area to provide up - to - the second information to calculate the quickest route			1
users will be able to search for transport options using a map and their location , or by time , or a particular route			0
it proposes using a ' dynamic focus table ' , which provides a list of options that are updated as new information comes in , and changes as commuters move along their route			0
@entity1 claims it would be able to use information provided by transport companies themselves , information collected by third parties , and even data from sensors carried on board vehicles			1
the patent application said : ' the commute application provides a novel user interface that presents the routes and the schedules for the routes in an intuitive and fluid manner			1
' for instance , the commute application of some embodiments includes several user interface widgets for facilitating the presentation of different routes that are part of different transit systems in a way that different route alternatives can be easily viewed			0
the patent suggests that the new app will send commuters alerts if a bus or train on their route is running late			2
users will be able to search for transport options using a map and their location , or by time , or a particular route @entity1 hopes its @entity144 will help tourists by replacing the need for tube maps and bus timetables @entity1 's patent will allow commuters to scroll through a route by time , showing where a service will stop commuters will be able to select a backup route to help them should there be problems on their chosen journey ( illustrated ) ' the commute application provides a dynamic focus table that dynamically presents schedules for trips along a particular route			1
' for instance , when a particular route is selected to view its details , the dynamic focus table automatically presents the next upcoming trip along the particular route			0
' in some embodiments , the dynamic focus table displays the next upcoming trip information based on the current time of the device and the location of the device			0
the dynamic focus table allows a user to quickly scroll though all the trips that are scheduled to travel along the a particular route throughout the day or for a certain period of time			0
' in some embodiments the commute application receives updates to the arrival and departure time of transit vehicles at each stop along a route from a set of servers operated by a transit operators or from one or more third parties or from equipment that these parties install on the transit vehicles			0
' the patent , titled ' @entity194 ' , builds on @entity1 's maps service that it provides on all its devices			1
it proposes using a ' dynamic focus table ' , which provides a list of options that are updated as new information comes in , and changes as commuters move along their route unlike @entity207 's @entity206 service , it is not yet able to provide detailed transport network information			1
and @entity206 has been previously criticised for not being as accurate as its rival			0
in the past few years @entity1 has acquired a number of firms that produce transportation apps , including @entity214 , @entity215 and @entity216			1
@entity1 's patent includes options for saving a route , saving favourite locations and selecting a backup route for a trip			2
users would also be able to check specific stops to see all the services that pass through it regardless of time and mode of transport			0
@entity1 also proposes to include information about internet access along a route and etiquette for boarding vehicles , where to stand on a platform and on escalators			2
it is also expected to be able to keep updating in the background , sending commuters notifications if a bus or train on their chosen route is running late .			0

@entity12 patent application shows @entity1 is developing a @entity144
the new service will help @entity1 compete with @entity246 which already provide information about public transport and can plan journeys
@entity1 has recently acquired several companies that make travel apps
app will even help commuters plan journeys by boat , plane and helicopter
