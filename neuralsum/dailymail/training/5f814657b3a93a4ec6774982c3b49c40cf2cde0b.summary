by @entity0 published : 16:03 est , 18 february 2014 @entity2 : 17:15 est , 18 february 2014 he is held up as one of the best examples of a perfect man , and one of the most recognisable sketches in the world			2
but now the iconic vitruvian man , drawn by @entity11 in 1490 , has been revealed as just being human after all			1
researchers believe an unusual lump above his groin reveals the model was suffering for a severe hernia - and it might even have killed him			1
@entity18 by @entity11 : experts say a bulge in the groin area reveals the model suffered a severe hernia - and it the model was a corpse , could have been the cause of death the drawing , which is in pen and ink on paper , depicts a male figure in two superimposed positions with his arms and legs apart and simultaneously inscribed in a circle and square			1
the drawing and text are sometimes called the @entity18 or , less often , @entity18			0
it is kept in the @entity38 of the @entity39 , in @entity40 , @entity41 , under reference 228			0
like most works on paper , it is displayed to the public only occasionally			0
the drawing is based on the correlations of ideal human proportions with geometry described by the ancient @entity52 architect @entity51 in @entity53 of his treatise @entity54 , which @entity11 obsessed over			1
the image is a perfectly drawn circle on top of a square , with a naked man inside			1
many have taken the model , known as vitruvian man , to be the ' perfect ' man			1
however , @entity64 , a lecturer at @entity65 , believes in fact the model was suffering from a major medical condition			1
he believes a bulge slightly above the left side of the groin is an inguinal hernia			1
caused by the the protrusion of abdominal - cavity contents through the inguinal canal , they are found in 27 % of men , and 3 % of women			0
' on studying the drawing , one can observe that the left inguinal region of @entity18 demonstrates a spherical fullness above his groin that is consistent with ove and medial to the pubic tubercle , ' he wrote in a letter to the journal @entity87			0
' this corresponds to the classical manifestation of an inguinal hernia in @entity11 's depiction of the human form			1
' @entity64 says that doctors at the time would have been aware of the condition			0
' knowledge of inguinal hernias was present during the renaissance , with physician s and surgeons such as @entity101 describing several types of of hernia in @entity104 at the time , ' he wrote			0
' vitruvian man may therefore have been modelled on a living or cadaveric individuial who had suffered from an asymptomatic left inguinal hernia , or who may have died from the complications of such hernias by means in incarceration of strangulation			2
' the image is based on the correlations of ideal human proportions with geometry described by the ancient @entity52 architect @entity51 in @entity53 of his treatise @entity54 , which @entity11 obsessed over			1
the transcript of the famous @entity124 by @entity11			2
researchers now believe one of his most famous models suffered a serious medical condition in @entity53 of his treatise @entity54 , @entity51 wrote : ' for if a man be placed flat on his back , with his hands and feet extended , and a pair of compasses centered at his navel , the fingers and toes of his two hands and feet will touch the circumference of a circle described therefrom			2
' and just as the human body yields a circular outline , so too a square figure may be found from it			0
' @entity11 believed humankind represented a microcosm of the universe , and believed this images showed that			2
he wrote in a notebook entry dated to around 1492 : ' by the ancients man has been called the world in miniature ; and certainly this name is well bestowed , because , inasmuch as man is composed of earth , water , air and fire , his body resembles that of the earth			0
' other experts agree with @entity64 , including @entity163 , director of the @entity164 at @entity165			0
' if it is nâ€™t a hernia , ' @entity163 told @entity168 , ' then i really have no idea what it would be			0

image was *created* by @entity11 to show the perfect human proportions
odd bulge in the groin reveal the model may have suffered a severe hernia
condition may even have killed the model - who could have been drawn as a corpse
