' that was clear with the @entity59 because three days ago @entity4 issued a statement saying there would be retaliation against the coalition			2
' a @entity59 man was kidnapped in @entity65 and he has been beheaded			0
so in a way sadly they did what they announced			0
' ' so i think countries being part of this coalition will have to take some measures to protect their citizens and assess the risk			2

he admitted the 2003 invasion of @entity13 by @entity207 's government ' hangs heavy ' over the @entity191 , but warned today 's situation is ' very different '			0
