by @entity0 published : 18:44 est , 18 july 2013 updated : 18:44 est , 18 july 2013 the remorselessly rising number of carrier bags used by shoppers in @entity5 passed seven billion last year , official figures show			1
despite repeated promises by @entity8 to curb the plastic carriers handed out by supermarkets , the total has shot up by more than 12 per cent in two years			1
by contrast the number of bags used in @entity13 – where shoppers have been asked to pay a 5p levy on each bag they take from a shop – has fallen from 270million to 70million since the charge came in			1
scourge : @entity21 plastic bags cast aside near a @entity22 in @entity23 , @entity24			0
the number of plastic bags handed out has risen 12 per cent in two years despite @entity26 promises to tackle their widespread use the first full year ’s bag count following the introduction of the charge in @entity13 appeared to vindicate retailers and campaigners who say the only way to cut numbers of bags is to impose a levy			1
mr @entity8 and @entity37 have declined to follow the @entity13 example through fears that voters would resent paying extra for plastic carriers that have always been provided free by supermarkets			2
however , research in @entity13 suggests a big majority of shoppers supports the levy , from which money raised goes to charity rather than the government			2
the @entity50 , which represents the retail industry , said progress had been made in @entity5 , and that the weight of plastic handed out at the tills had fallen because bags are becoming smaller and lighter			0
a @entity57 suffocates on a plastic bag : marine animals and birds suffer long , painful deaths after eating them or getting tangled in them but it said : ‘ if you want to go further and faster on this you would have to introduce legislation for a charge			0
’ the @entity70 ’s @entity69 campaign has been calling for action to cut the numbers of bags and the environmental damage they cause when they are discarded			0
many of the bags are used for only 20 minutes but take up to 1,000 years to rot away			1
they litter the landscape and devastate marine animals and birds , which suffer long , painful deaths after eating them or getting tangled in them			0
the bag count , produced by the government ’s @entity81 , showed that in 2012 the number used in @entity5 went up by 290million to 7.06billion , a 4.4 per cent rise			0
over two years the increase has been almost 800million			0
the increase pushed numbers used in the @entity87 as a whole over the eight billion mark , despite the collapse in numbers in @entity13 and steady usage in @entity93 , which will introduce a charge next year , and @entity95 , where one was implemented in april			1
in @entity13 , where the 5p levy was introduced in november 2011 , 350million bags were used in 2010 , a total which fell to 270million in 2011 as the levy came into play			1
last year 70million carrier bags were used in @entity13			1
@entity102 , @entity13 minister for natural resources and food , said : ‘ checkouts in @entity13 are now full of people reusing their bags			2
the figures show that a compulsory charge really does work			0
’ @entity110 , of the @entity111 , said : ‘ an increase in bag use in @entity5 and a massive decrease in @entity13 are resounding evidence for the government to finally introduce a charge on carrier bags in @entity5			2
’ in @entity5 among major supermarkets only @entity119 has imposed its own 5p charge .			0

the total number of bags given out has shot up 12 per cent in two years
but in @entity13 , where they cost 5p , numbers handed out have *plummetted*
many bags are used for only minutes but take a thousand years to rot away
