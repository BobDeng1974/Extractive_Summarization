an @entity1 mother whose daughter took her own life when she was just 14 years old is fighting to push through a new piece of legislation that would make schools play a bigger role when it comes to bullying			1
@entity10 was in eighth grade when her mother found her hanged from a tree , leaving behind a suicide note after enduring years of bullying that started with her weight , hair and appearance and took a far darker turn at the end , with students mocking the girl for the years of sexual abuse she suffered at the hands of her father			1
she said in her note ; ' it 's bullying that killed me			1
' words her mother , @entity30 , still lives by as she continues her fight to make sure schools do everything in their power to monitor harassment and bullying			1
@entity10 ( pictured ) was in eighth grade when she took her own life , the result of years of bullying claims her mother @entity30 ( above ) has now made a point to do evertything she can to curb bullying in schools @entity41 has made this her priority every day since march 5 , 2013 , when she looked over from a bus stop and realized after a few seconds that the young girl hanging from the tree with a rope around her neck was her daughter			1
since then , she drafted a new anti-bullying law that received 150,000 signatures and provided a few major changes in how the state of @entity1 would try to curb harassment , with the biggest change being that schools would start being held accountable			1
like most young people , girls in particular , @entity10 was bullied about the same things as most other kids her age starting in about sixth grade , be it her weight or her freckles or her hair			2
then , when @entity10 entered eighth grade , students began mocking her when her father was arrested after years of sexually abusing and molesting her			1
he plead guilty and is serving out an 18 - year sentence			2
this is why holding schools accountable for harassment is so important to @entity41 , who believes that bullying is what pushed her daughter to suicide			1
the @entity76 told @entity77 that ' administrators are confident the school made all social and emotional resources , internal and external , available to this child and family			2
' ' it 's bullying that killed me			1
please get justice , ' wrote @entity10 in her suicide note @entity10 ended her life , her body seen before she had been identified from a bus stop by her mother , hanged from a tree after the bill found a sponsor and was set to go , @entity41 thought her mission was over , until she got the news that she said ' hit us like a ton of bricks			1
' there were 307 pages of proposed changes , and one of those changes , which even @entity41 was unaware of , was the removal of the section that made schools accountable for harassment			1
dear @entity109 , i 'm really sorry that i did this			0
do n't you ever think it was your fault			0
i love you so much and i could n't ask for a better mum			0
thank you for caring and feeding and loving me for 14 years			2
i 'm sorry once again			0
but my heart ca n't take this pain			0
i 'm gon na miss you so much			0
and i ca n't wait till the day i get to see you again			0
i 'll be waiting at @entity120 's gates for you			2
goodbye : ( @entity122 @entity123			0
it 's bullying that killed me			1
now @entity41 has started a new petition on @entity127 to get the bill stopped until this is put back in and schools are legally required to take an active role , which , despite the extra work , will help curb bullying and suicides			1
' my beautiful daughter @entity10 took her own life after being repeatedly bullied by classmates both in person on school grounds and over the internet , ' writes @entity41 on her page			1
' the pain of losing a child is indescribable -- she was the light of my life and i still ca nâ€™t comprehend life without her			2
' on the other side however is @entity147 , the attorney for the firm who advised undoing those measures , and , as he explains it , this law is already in existence			0
bullying , he says , is covered by federal anti-discrimination laws			0
he also reports the inexact science of aspects of the bill , such as asking schools to report incidents of bullying , and pointing out that ' some said they had none and some said they had like 400			2
' as for @entity41 , despite her new fight and the setbacks presented by this unforeseen change , there is one bright side , and that comes with the outpouring of love and support she received when she set up her change.org page			0
' i sat down a little bit ago and started reading some of the comments , ' she revealed last week			0
' and i just sat here and cried			0
' for confidential support in the @entity183 , call the @entity184 on 1 - 800 - 273 - 8255			0
for confidential support in the @entity186 call the @entity187 on 08457 90 90 90 , visit a local @entity187 branch or see @entity189 .			0

@entity10 took her own life when the 14 - year - old was still in eighth grade , and was found hanged from a tree
@entity10 had been bullied at her school for years , but when her father was *convicted* of molesting her the students began mocking her
in her suicide note , @entity10 wrote ' it 's bullying that killed me . please get justice . '
her mother @entity205 has been doing just that and worked on an anti-bullying law that would hold schools accountable for harassment
as the final bill is set to hit the @entity214 for a vote she has learned that the section most important to her has been removed from the bill
now she has started a petition to block the *passage* of the bill until this section if put back in , and has over 150,000 signatures
