@entity0 is a retired teacher for the @entity1			1
@entity0 and her husband , @entity3 , both having hearing difficulties , and in 2009 fell in love with a deaf @entity7 cat they found on the website petfinder			1
the cat , @entity11 , was in @entity12 , so it took a while for her to be transported to @entity15 where the couple live			2
in that time @entity0 made the decision that she was going to teach @entity11 , as well as her other cats , @entity19 and @entity20 , how to sign			1
and she believes it worked paws up : in a video posted online , and @entity0 told @entity33 : ' since my daughters learned signs from infancy , i had ideas how to introduce sign			1
she added : ' guess i missed the kiddies so i began teaching the kitties ! ' @entity0 said it took time , but after dedicating herself to the task , she eventually got there			0
the cats are now able to understand her signs for words such as ' stay ' , ' sit ' , ' shake ' , ' dance ' and many more			1
' cats become much more interactive with people because they want to communicate , ' @entity0 said			0
' @entity19 was a '' pillow that ate '' before he learned sign			0
all rise : the cats seem quite up on the whole ' up ' sign , according to @entity0 's @entity59 video treat time : @entity0 's method for teaching the cats involved a lot of discipline			2
and treats ' he interacted with other cats , but ignored people			0
' after he learned sign at age 7 years , he became the extroverted show cat ! ' my cats will also do tricks with other people who sign with them			0
' the video of @entity0 and her signing was made by her son - in - law , @entity79 , and originally posted to @entity59 .			0

@entity0 retired as a teacher at the @entity1
she then adopted a deaf @entity7 cat online
@entity0 decided to teach @entity11 and her two other pet cats to sign
she showed them simple words like ' stay ' and ' sit '
believes it has helped better shape their *personalities*
