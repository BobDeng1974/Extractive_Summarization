actress @entity0 says she feared for her life when a stunt went ‘ horribly ’ wrong on the set of her latest movie			1
the 37 - year - old plays a glamorous escapologist in @entity7 – which starts with dramatic shots of her freeing herself from shackles while submerged in a tank of water			1
the scene demanded she bang desperately on the glass walls to give the impression of being in distress			1
but when her chains became entangled , she revealed that she started to panic for real			1
the former home and away actress , who also stars in @entity38 ’s £ 60 million new version of @entity39 , said she got into trouble after being submerged for two - and - a - half minutes			1
‘ they had a guy who was off camera , but he was a long way away with a can of oxygen , ’ she said			2

however , she added : ‘ luckily , i managed to get free and stay level - headed and got out before it went even more horribly wrong			2
’ she also said that in her moment of panic she thought : ‘ not in a swimming costume			2
no one wants to go in a swimming costume			2
’ however , @entity0 , a mother of two , said : ‘ i do n’t see myself as particularly brave			0
i rely on gut instinct to accept a role			0
if something terrifies me i am going to do it			0
