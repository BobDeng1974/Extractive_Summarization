@entity1 chairman @entity0 challenged more clubs to grow their own @entity3 as he unveiled his new quota proposals designed to boost the numbers of elite @entity7 footballers			1
@entity0 wants to change the rules until nearly half of each 25 - man squad in the @entity11 is ' @entity12 ' under his stricter definition of what makes a ' @entity12 ' player			1
together with new @entity17 rules on work permits for @entity20 footballers , agreed with the @entity1 and set to be introduced in may , he believes this can increase the ratio of @entity7 players in the @entity11 from 35 to over 40 per cent and produce an @entity7 team to win the @entity25 in 2022			1
@entity0 has challenged more clubs to grow their own @entity27 to help @entity7 win the @entity25 @entity1 chairman @entity0 has proposed three rule changes to what makes a home - grown player while there is a slight increase in the number of @entity7 players in the @entity11 this year — up from 32 % last year to 35 % — that is largely down to @entity37 being promoted			1
if they were to be relegated and replaced by @entity40 — second in the @entity41 — the proportion would fall to 31 %			0
however , only 22 % of the starters in the current top four teams are qualified to play for @entity7 , compared to 28 % last year			2
in 2014 , just 23 @entity7 players appeared in the @entity46 group stage , compared with 78 @entity47 , 55 @entity48 and 51 @entity49			2
this season the three @entity7 clubs that reached the knockout stages of the @entity46 started only 10 @entity7 players , compared to 12 @entity53 and nine @entity47 in those three sides			2
in the last two weeks only five @entity7 players started in the second legs of the knockout stage			2
in 2010 @entity58 won the @entity41 , beating @entity59 in the final			0
of that 18 - man match - day squad , only four have gone on to play more than 20 top - flight games , while double that from the @entity47 squad have done so in @entity64			1
of the 12 clubs who have played in each of the last five @entity11 seasons , the average number of home - grown players per squad has gone from 11.4 to 9.4			1
only 62 % of current home - grown players are qualified to play for @entity7			1
@entity0 set this target 18 months ago when he established a @entity75 to investigate the diminishing number of @entity7 players at the top level and a clock on the wall of the coaches ' room at @entity83 is counting down to the @entity25 final in 2022 , albeit the wrong date since @entity86 confirmed the @entity88 tournament will be moved to winter			1
@entity0 warned he is prepared to force his rule - changes through the courts if agreements can not be reached with the @entity11 and the @entity92			1
his proposal is to make three changes to the ' @entity12 ' player rules , to be phased in over four years from the start of 2016 - 17			2
1 ) a home grown player is a player irrespective of nationality who is registered to play in @entity7 or @entity100 for three years before his 18th birthday ( rather than his 21st birthday as currently stated )			1
this takes players like @entity105 out of the equation , and others signed at 16			0
2 ) reduce the number of @entity110 players in a 25 - man first - team squad from 17 to 13			1
and so increase the @entity114 players from eight to 12			0
3 ) introduce requirement that at least two @entity12 players are ' club trained ' , ie. have been registered with their current club for three years prior to their 18th birthday			0
@entity0 's vision is to open pathways for those like @entity3 to make the final step from talented development player to the first - team without unexceptional foreign players blocking the route			1
' how many more @entity27 are out there who just ca n't get a game ? ' said @entity0 , summoning the example of the 21 - year - old @entity135 striker who has broken into the first - team this season , took his goal tally to 29 with a hat - trick on saturday and has been rewarded with his first senior @entity7 call - up			1
@entity3 scored his first @entity11 hat - trick for @entity135 at the weekend and has a bright @entity7 future @entity7 manager @entity143 has called up @entity3 to the @entity7 senior squad for the first time ' suddenly an @entity7 kid who was out on loan and touch - and - go to get a game in the first - team is the top - scorer in @entity7 football			1
' a lot of very talented kids are going into professional football clubs at a very young age and an awful lot are getting lost			0
we have to do more to help these kids and give future @entity7 managers a greater chance of success			2
' it is also not aimed at disadvantaging our clubs in @entity166 competitions			0
apart from @entity169 , who have this established association with @entity49 talent , every other club in the @entity46 quarter - finals would satisfy these criteria			0
' if @entity175 , @entity176 , @entity177 , @entity178 , @entity179 , @entity180 and @entity181 can do it , why ca n't our clubs ? ' @entity0 ( centre ) has a vision that he hopes will enable @entity7 to win the @entity184 only 23 @entity7 players appeared in the @entity46 group stage this season , and three - @entity188 ( left ) , @entity189 ( centre ) and @entity191 ( right ) - have retired from international duty only 23 @entity7 players appeared in the @entity46 group stage this season , compared with 51 @entity49 , 55 @entity48 and 78 @entity47 players			1
three - @entity188 , @entity191 and @entity189 - have retired from international duty			0
only five @entity7 players started in the second leg of the last 16 ties : @entity188 , @entity199 , @entity200 , @entity201 and @entity202			0
' that 's the grim picture at the top of the game , but it 's hard to argue we don ' t have the talent , ' said @entity0 , who applauded the work of the academies and the @entity11 's @entity212			1
the @entity1 chairman reaffirmed the his commitment to improving coach education and grassroots facilities but has abandoned the idea of allowing b - teams to compete within the @entity92 framework			1
@entity199 ( left ) was one of just five @entity7 players to start in the second leg of the @entity46 last 16 @entity222 's @entity221 won the @entity223 on sunday , but plans are forming to include under 21 teams alongside @entity226 and two clubs ' there 's no point flogging a dead horse , ' he said , but plans are forming to include @entity233 teams from @entity11 clubs in the @entity223			2
asked about the reaction he expected from the clubs , @entity0 replied : ' some will buy in , some wo n't			2
we will go round and try to convince them			0
we will ask : are you sure you have n't got a @entity3 playing in your youth side ? ' it 's not an option i 'd like to go down but the @entity1 could change the rules			1
or we could persuade @entity166 to change the rules			0
' @entity0 has taken legal advice and believes he could force this through			0
the @entity249 @entity1 have agreed to @entity20 restrictions in @entity251 from 2016			0
@entity252 qualifies for a work permit under the old formula , but not under the new formula @entity256 ( right ) is another player who would struggle to obtain a work permit under the new system the @entity17 work permit changes are expected to quicken the process			0
from may , @entity20 work permits will be reset with a new formula involving the player 's cost combined with his nationality and international experience and leagues where he has played			0
the top 50 ranked nations will be eligible , rather than the top 70			0
overall this would increase the opportunities of @entity49 and @entity271 but reduce those from lower ranked nations , meaning that players like @entity274 , @entity275 , @entity276 , @entity277 , @entity252 and @entity278 who qualified under the old system , would fail			0
the @entity1 estimate that 42 players who acquired work permits in the last five years would not under the new rules			2
and , although there will be an appeals process , it will be less lenient than before when 80 per cent of appeals were successful .			0
