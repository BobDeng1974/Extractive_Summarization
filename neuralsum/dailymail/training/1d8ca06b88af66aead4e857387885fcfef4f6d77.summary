by @entity0 published : 05:24 est , 6 march 2013 updated : 07:37 est , 6 march 2013 town hall bosses will spend £ 210,000 of taxpayers ' money on two new ponds for just 18 newts @entity6 agreed the plans yesterday after being told it must create new habitats for a colony of great crested newts that are protected by @entity12 law before construction on a £ 30million bypass can begin			1
the move has been slammed by campaigners as ' unrealistic ' when councils are being forced to slash budgets on frontline services			1
the council already has to make £ 13million of savings this year			0
expense : @entity6 has voted to spend £ 210,000 on moving 18 newts so it can build a new bypass rare : @entity24 are protected by @entity26 law and work can not start until they are safely moved work on building the new habitat will begin later this month to ensure that the area ’s newt population has time to settle into their new habitat			1
a council spokesperson said : ' great crested newts are a protected species and as such we are required by law to protect their habitat			1
' the £ 26.5m @entity39 road is a major infrastructure project that will impact on their environment			2
the money is being used to create a suitable wildlife habitat , including the ponds , that will ensure the species continue to thrive			0
' plans for the 1.1km @entity47 - running between @entity39 and @entity48 - went straight through an area dubbed ‘ pond capital of @entity12 ’			1
an environmental survey of the affected area counted just 18 of the rare amphibians spread over a 500m area - putting the cost of the project at £ 11,666.66p per newt			2
construction of the bypass can not go ahead until the newts are relocated to a new habitat next year			1
the ecological study centered around wetlands on either side of @entity65 , near the village of @entity67 , @entity6 - known as ‘ the pond capital of @entity12 ’ and noted for its wildlife			1
ecologists surveyed 30 ponds , marshes and swamps and found great crested newts in 14 of them			1
the largest newt population discovered in a single pond was just six , although eggs were found at ten sites			0
the discovery of the newts , which are protected by @entity26 law , has already delayed construction			1
the species are one of the most protected in @entity12 and one of the most endangered			2
population numbers are estimated at about 400,000 in the @entity87			0
@entity88 : the area between the @entity90 ( pictured ) and the @entity91 is known as major home of the rare newts protected : ecologists found newts in half the ponds and marshes surveyed and eggs were found at ten of them ( file picture ) the cost of creating ‘ artificial wetland ’ areas is expected to reach £ 190,000 , with an extra £ 20,000 needed to cover legal and surveying costs			2
a report to the council said : ' the construction of the proposed @entity108 will result in the loss of natural great crested newt habitat areas which in accordance with protected species guidelines must be mitigated by the provision of suitable alternative habitat			2
' this is also a condition of our planning permission for the road			0
' the council will be able to claim some of the money back from the @entity122 , which is providing 60 per cent of the funding for the bypass - but only if the road scheme goes ahead			2
' @entity128 , @entity127 said : ' this is an incredible amount of money to spend on relocating a group of amphibians to a new pond			0
' for the size of this bill the authorities could have moved several families , not just a group of newts			0
' protecting endangered wildlife is important , but councils must ensure the costs of doing so are realistic and affordable to taxpayers			0
' a @entity145 spokesman said the area - between the @entity90 and @entity91 - was known as a major newt habitat			0
he said : ' this area is an important stronghold for great crested newts , given its long history of ponds and small wetlands			1
it may even be the " pond capital " of @entity12			0
' the creation of new ponds , especially if well - managed , is a tried - and - tested conservation technique to safeguard these rare amphibians			0

@entity6 agreed the plans so it can build £ 30million bypass
@entity163 crested newts - the @entity87 *'s* largest - are protected by @entity12 law
construction on road can not start until the newts are safely moved
campaigners say spend is ' unrealistic ' when councils are slashing budgets
