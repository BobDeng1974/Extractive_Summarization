@entity0 has made sure new manager @entity1 knows all about him by impressing on @entity3 's pre-season tour to @entity4			1
the @entity6 boss is putting the finishing touches to his plans for the season but what will he have at his disposal if he decides to keep the 21 - year - old @entity0 ? he 's looked good this summer ... yes , @entity0 has appeared in several of the pre-season tour games , demonstrating his versatility by impressing in both the attacking midfield position and the right - wing back role			1
usually , @entity16 - born @entity0 plays from the wide positions or as a second forward			2
he is a very capable finisher			0
where have i seen him before ? he enjoyed successful loan spells at @entity45 and @entity46 last season in the @entity48 but he was also the star man on @entity3 's tour of @entity50 and @entity51 last summer , finishing as the top - scorer			1
mixing with the big boys : @entity0 and @entity54 do battle in @entity3 's pre-season win over @entity57 why was n't he handed a chance by @entity59 ? the tricky fixture list - @entity3 faced @entity61 , @entity28 and @entity62 in the opening weeks - saw @entity59 revert to more experienced names in his bid to get off to a promising start			1
after that plan backfired , @entity59 found himself in a scenario where every match became hugely pressurised and the @entity70 refused to hand @entity0 an opportunity			2
he was in line for a start in the @entity74 but @entity3 were drawn against @entity28 and @entity59 was anxious to get a result by that stage			0
where would he fit in under @entity78 ? with wingers out of fashion in @entity78 â€™s new 3 - 5 - 2 system , @entity0 could be in trouble at @entity3 but he may feel he can operate in the hole behind two forwards or as a frontman himself , although his side is well - stocked in those positions			2
his best chance may be as a right wing - back , where he played against @entity90 , offering competition to @entity92 and @entity93			0
the @entity6 will outline his plans to the @entity3 squad at the end of this week in a host of meetings in @entity99			0
where could he go ? plenty of @entity48 sides , including @entity46 , are monitoring @entity0 with regards to a loan			1
@entity105 are understood to have had an approach over a permanent move rebuffed in january			0
silver lining : @entity0 and fellow youngster @entity109 got their hands on the @entity112			0

@entity0 has impressed on @entity3 's pre-season tour
he enjoyed a *similar* pre-season last year before going out on loan
@entity0 had spells with @entity46 and @entity45 in the *championship*
