now she is also being invited to student debating societies after she appeared at the @entity13 party conference and demanded the government do more to get people into work			1
and she has still not ruled out standing as an mp next year - even though it would mean a pay cut			1
her manager @entity29 told @entity40 : ' she usually goes for an hour and sits in the vip area where she 's looked after by a couple of doormen			2
' last week we had one where 200 or 300 people queued up to meet her and it took us 45 minutes just to get from the car into the venue			2
' her minimum fee is £ 1,500 an hour and for a big awards ceremony for example - unless it 's for charity - that could double			1
' last week she presented a footballing award and next week she 's presenting an award at an @entity57 community event			2
' well - known : the resident of @entity34 's @entity6 shot into the headlines on @entity60 's @entity6 long road travelled : this week she appeared at the @entity13 conference and has been invited to student debates the mother - of - two shot into headlines in january for her bullish appearances on @entity69 's controversial fly - on - the - wall show @entity6			1
when she appeared on the documentary her last full - time job had been at @entity72 - from which she was fired in 2007 , and narrowly avoided a jail sentence , for stealing £ 13,000			1
she was immediately controversial when she was shown swearing repeatedly at her children and having little motivation to search for a job after years of unemployment			0
@entity78 : she said it was ' not fair ' for benefits claimints to earn more than minimum - wage workers in the months after @entity6 she began cashing in on her notoriety , flying to @entity83 where she downed shots with punters while still claiming sickness benefits			2
she then stopped claiming state handouts in may , and has since built a career around her status as a tv personality			0
the mother - of - two appeared on celebrity @entity91 and will feature in a @entity93 documentary on her new lifestyle from january			2
mr @entity29 claimed she is ' easily ' earning at the 40 per cent tax rate and has often pulled in fees from several nightclubs a night - though she still makes less than big names from @entity99 is @entity100			1
' during the @entity102 period where every nightclub wants someone we can do as many as 12 venues , ' he said			2
' you start with an under - 16s disco and you 're still doing a gay club at 3.30am			2
' the culmination of her unusual new life came on monday when she appeared at a fringe event at the @entity13 party conference - and admitted the life she had boasted of living previously was ' unfair '			1
she said : ' it 's not fair that someone works a 40 - hour , if not more , week and does n't have as much to live on as someone who sits at home , does n't work and is given money from the government			1
' but that 's not that individual 's fault , that is the government 's fault			0
i think the @entity128 also has to look at ( the ) minimum wage and things like that			0
' it 's the government that says how much someone is entitled to to live on , not the individual			0
' she also laid in to government policy , saying : ' i have experienced some not very nice job centres , ' she said			0
' you do just go in , you sit down , you are looked down upon			0
' they just need to understand that , just because you are on benefits does not mean that you are not a real person			0
just because you are on benefits does n't mean that you are not physically looking for a job			0
' big ambitions : the 43 - year - old has still not ruled out standing as an mp - even though it would earn her less asked about the welfare changes introduced since 2010 , she said : ' i have noticed a change			1
i think it 's considerably got worse			0
' miss @entity30 has still not ruled out standing as an mp next year , despite reports that she no longer wants to because she earns more as a ' celebrity '			1
' i 've said she should put it on the back burner for ten years because she would n't be able to be as outspoken or do as many appearances ' , mr @entity29 said			0
' why would she want to be an mp on £ 60,000 when she would be very restricted on what she would be doing ? ' but she 's a strong - willed woman so she wo n't necessarily listen to me			1
' almost 900 viewers complained to @entity161 after @entity6 was aired			0
