by @entity1 reporter published : 01:01 est , 7 november 2012 updated : 06:22 est , 7 november 2012 @entity5 's vice presidential pick @entity4 in the end failed to help his running mate win the @entity8 last night , and to add insult to injury , the rising star of the @entity3 was left embarrassed after losing his home state of @entity12			1
however , the congressman 's night was not a complete loss as he easily won re-election to the @entity17 seat he has held since 1998 and received a ringing endorsement from his running mate			1
in his concession speech early wednesday morning , @entity5 lavished praised on his would - be vice president for all he has done for their campaign over the past year			1
' and i trust that his intellect and his hard work and his commitment to principle will continue to contribute to the good of our nation			0
' even before he was tapped as @entity5 's @entity49 , @entity4 was regarded as one of the @entity3 's ' young guns			1
' as chairman of the powerful @entity53 , he gained prominence when he drew up an austere budget blueprint that would reshape @entity56 for many people into a voucher - like program			0
he also attracted attention for wanting to keep tax breaks in place that were set to expire for the wealthy			0
if he had won both races , @entity4 would have had to resign from @entity64 and a special election would have been held to fill the @entity8 seat			1
right - hand man : @entity26 , left , has spent the past year crisscrossing the country to get president @entity27 , right , re-elected partners : @entity3 presidential nominee @entity5 and vice-presidential nominee @entity4 ( left ) gestures to supporters and campaign workers at a campaign office in @entity73 , @entity74 november 6 but that was not to in the stars			1
@entity5 ended up losing the election , as well as @entity4 's home state , which @entity27 won with 52 per cent of the votes to @entity5 47 per cent , walking away with 10 electoral votes			1
unlike his @entity3 counterpart , vice president @entity26 , who had spent the past year tirelessly campaigning for @entity27 , likely helped him score a victory in his state of @entity29 , where the commander - in - chief walked away with 59 per cent of the vote			1
despite tuesday 's major setback , @entity4 's future appears to be nothing if not bright , and according to media reports , the @entity3 hot shot has been working on an exit strategy long before the election			2
in a story leaked to @entity95 of the @entity96 , @entity4 's aides said that he will be just fine even in defeat			2
' professor @entity4 ? lobbyist @entity4 ? maybe back to plain - old rep. @entity4 or future president @entity98 ? ' said the @entity96 story 's lead , implying that defeat is a foregone conclusion for the @entity5 / @entity4 ticket			1
some political pundits have suggested that the 42 - year - old congressman may be back on the campaign trail as early as 2016 , this time as a presidential candidate			0
one more round ? the 69 - year - old @entity26 , left , half - jokingly said that he might run for the @entity8 again history has n't been kind to losing vice presidential candidates			2
only two have gone on to become presidents themselves			0
the last two failed running mates were @entity115 and @entity116 - one went on to a reality television show , the other 's personal life turned out to be fit for a soap opera			0
but no one expects the @entity3 ’s darling to have a similar fate , and he returns to @entity64 as a larger figure			0
his re-entry into daily politics in @entity127 comes as @entity64 enters a furious period of negotiations over averting a ‘ fiscal cliff ’ - a series of expiring tax cuts and pending spending cuts that could push the @entity134 back into recession if @entity64 can not reach a deal by january 1			0
now , @entity4 's status as @entity53 chairman will be joined with a new political celebrity , giving the author of the @entity3 ' fiscal plans an even greater hand in directing the debate			2
at the time of his selection by @entity5 , @entity4 was a familiar figure to only 35 per cent of people , according to a @entity150 / @entity149 poll			1
today , he is a household name			0
high praise : in his victory speech , president @entity27 called @entity26 ' the best vice president anyone could ever hope for ' @entity4 's supporters say the campaign enhanced @entity4 's stature			1
speaking days before the election , representative @entity158 recalled a warm reception from democrats when @entity4 returned to the chamber 's floor this fall			2
they say that the campaign reinforced a reputation for truth - telling and open - mindedness , pointing to his speech on @entity56 at a convention for the @entity171 , a lobbying group for older @entity134 which has backed @entity27 administration proposals , as a sign of his political courage			2
@entity5 's loss is bound to provoke soul - searching among @entity3 who lost a presidential election despite @entity27 's vulnerability amid a weak economy			1
in theory , @entity4 is positioned like few other leaders to step into the void			0
‘ i 've been referring to @entity4 as the @entity190 of the next generation , ’ @entity183 said , referring to the @entity185 hero who warned @entity187 forces of impending threats from the @entity189			0
‘ i 'll tell you he 's just getting started , ’ he added			0
if @entity4 chooses to get into the fray in four years , he is likely to go head - to - head with the charismatic and outspoken @entity197 governor @entity196 on the @entity3 side			1
on the @entity201 side , the @entity12 congressman may even encounter his old rival @entity26 , 69 , who has not ruled a run for the @entity8			1
after voting tuesday morning in @entity29 , the 69 - year - old playfully responded to a reporter 's question about whether he thought this would be the last time he voted for himself in an election			0
‘ no , i do n't think so , ’ @entity26 said with a grin , according to @entity210			0
dream team : president @entity27 , second left , highly praised @entity212 , calling him the best vice president anyone could ever hope for during an 11th - hour campaign stop in @entity216 later in the day , the vice president was asked by a voter whether he would make yet another run for the @entity8 if @entity27 wins			1
‘ oh , i 'm going to go back home and run for county council or something , ’ @entity26 responded			0
@entity26 's first unsuccessful attempt to capture the presidency came in 1988 , when he was forced to end his campaign after being accused of plagiarizing parts of a speech			0
his brief 2008 run was most memorable for describing @entity27 as the ' first mainstream @entity228 who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice - looking guy			2
' but on wednesday morning , all that was left in the past as @entity27 opened his victory speech y praising his right - hand man as ' the best vice president anyone could ever hope for			2

president @entity27 won @entity12 with 52 per cent of the vote to @entity5 's 47 per cent
@entity5 highly praised @entity4 in his concession speech
@entity4 easily won re-election to the @entity17 seat he has held since 1998
congressman is expected to run for the @entity8 in 2016 , when he will likely face off against @entity197 governor @entity196
