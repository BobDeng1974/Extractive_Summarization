@entity2 business guru sir @entity0 , pictured with his wife @entity30 , wants a chip stall that operates outside his luxury chalet in @entity20 shut down , claiming that it 's an ' olfactory nuisance ' the stall is owned by @entity24 ( pictured ) , and her lawyer , @entity25 , argued that his client 's livelihood is more important than sir @entity13 's ' precious nostrils ' fuming : ms @entity24 has said she feels ' angry and persecuted ' the case will be heard at @entity38 court tomorrow - and is the fifth attempt by sir @entity13 to have the stall closed			1
his lawsuit argues that the stall , which is extremely popular with skiers who buy chips there throughout the day , produces ' a very important olfactory nuisance due to the cooking and frying odours that rise up into their flats and on to their balconies ' , according to @entity52			2
