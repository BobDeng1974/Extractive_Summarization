by @entity0 follow @ @ esdonn @entity1 insists the next generation of @entity3 stars can emerge at the @entity5 in @entity6 this summer			1
the 44 - year - old @entity8 track legend was accompanying the @entity9 on its journey around her home county of @entity12 today and insisted that excitement is building even now for the july showpiece event			1
while the @entity5 may struggle to match the magic and magnitude of the @entity17 , double olympic gold medallist @entity1 insists that the combination of established stars like @entity20 and the best of @entity3 ’s young talent can still inspire the nation			1
future : @entity1 believes a new generation of stars can come forward to @entity6 2014 champion : @entity1 won two gold medals at the @entity28 in the 800m and 1500m and , with @entity3 set to confirm their track and field squad on monday , @entity1 is optimistic about what she will witness at @entity32			1
‘ i won my first @entity5 gold 20 years ago in @entity36 , ’ said the former 800m and 1500m specialist			1
' i was sharing an apartment with @entity39			0
the year before , she had become world champion			0
the year before that , she had won @entity43 gold			1
‘ so there i was - no one knowing who i was , still young in sport - and i ’m sharing a room with an @entity43 champion			2
‘ this is what i think will happen again , with the likes of @entity20 , @entity54 , all those people , in @entity6			1
‘ two years after @entity36 , i was competing in an @entity17 , where i came fourth			0
‘ i got the silver medal in 98 after injury in @entity58 , and then i won bronze at the @entity43 in @entity60 two years after that			2
tour : @entity1 was in @entity12 where the @entity9 stopped as it travels around the @entity63 venue : @entity32 will be the main athletics stadium at the @entity65 ‘ i then won gold in @entity67 prior to my double gold in @entity69 in 2004			2
so i ’ve always had the @entity5 as a massive part of my own development			0
‘ the atmosphere , the environment , the fact you ’re with people from all different sports - that ’s an education in itself			0
‘ it ’s called the @entity79 and it is as everyone pretty much speaks the same language – but it ’s a friendly , competitive environment			0
‘ we ’ll see some amazing events happen			0
’ but what of @entity3 ’s chances of gold ? will the focus be on the likes of @entity43 champions @entity91 and @entity93 or could there be others to emerge as @entity1 once did ? ‘ it will be a strong squad , ’ said @entity1 , now the president of @entity96			1
‘ but the advantage of the @entity100 , because of the breakdown of the @entity102 , is that it gives a lot more people the opportunity to participate			0
glory : @entity1 says that stars such as double @entity43 gold medallist @entity20 can inspire youngsters experience : @entity43 champions @entity54 ( left ) and @entity93 ( right ) can help the youngsters ‘ it will provide some of @entity3 ’s up and coming talent with the chance to perform and make a breakthrough			1
‘ i ’d won @entity119 silver ( in the 1500m ) in my first year as an international athlete in 1994 but no one really knew me			0
‘ two weeks later , i won @entity123 gold in @entity36 and suddenly i was put on a completely different pedestal in terms of world - class sport			0
‘ and i think that ’s what is going to happen in @entity6 for @entity3 - with some new stars born			2

@entity1 expects @entity6 2014 to *unearth* new @entity132 talent
she believes stars such as @entity20 and @entity54 will inspire youngsters
the 44 - year - old expects a ' strong ' @entity3 squad at @entity5
@entity1 won double @entity43 gold at @entity28 in 800m and 1500m
