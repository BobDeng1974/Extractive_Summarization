published : 11:24 est , 26 march 2014 updated : 12:12 est , 26 march 2014 a new service is helping @entity2 who are too busy or lazy to get their hands on trendy new products by hiring out people to wait in line for them			1
@entity9 came up with the idea for his business , @entity16 , after selling two spots in line for the @entity15 launch and making an impressive $ 325			1
these days , he and his team rake in $ 25 for the first hour they spend in line and $ 10 for each half - hour after that			1
' it 's a phenomenon , ' he told @entity23			1
good things come to those who wait : @entity9 ( pictured ) founded @entity26 , a company that lets you hire people to stand in line for you and wait for @entity30 , iphones and other trendy releases ' i did an interview with @entity35 a while ago and i explained @entity36 : fear of missing out , ' said the former @entity39 employee			1
' especially [ in ] @entity2 , you have friends and you 're hanging out and it 's like , " did you see that new exhibit at @entity45 ? " " do you know what a @entity30 is ? " ' indeed , the @entity30 is particularly hard to come by because only 200 are made per day , and there is always a line of at least 40 people outside before the @entity49 even opens its doors			2
mr @entity49 recently had to crack down on scalpers who were buying @entity30 in bulk - which is against the two @entity30 per customer limit - and selling them on @entity55 for up to $ 40 each			2
lucrative business : mr @entity9 ( pictured in line for a @entity30 at @entity49 ) and his team rake in $ 25 for the first hour they spend in line and $ 10 for each half - hour after that sought - after : the @entity30 is particularly hard to come by because only 200 are made per day , and there is always a line of at least 40 people outside before the bakery even opens its doors but mr @entity9 sticks to the rules			1
' i have two or three uber rich clients , ' he reveals			2
' one wants cronuts a lot [ for ] whenever friends come to visit from out of town			2
' so he gets to the bakery hours ahead of its 8am open time , armed with his usual tools for staying occupied : a portable charger , two iphones , an ipad mini and hand warmers			2
for the longer waits , like the launch of @entity83 for @entity84 , he brings a sleeping bag and even a tent			0
' it just pops up , and people will look like , " oh my @entity89 , it 's that serious , " ' he jokes , adding that a lawn chair , the @entity92 and @entity93 also come in handy			0
tricks of the trade : to stay occupied , he brings a portable charger , two iphones and an ipad mini ( pictured : the line for autographs by @entity103 stars @entity104 and @entity105 ) the longest he 's ever had to wait in line was a whopping 19 hours for the new @entity15			1
' that was how the whole idea of line sitting came about , ' he reveals			0
at the time , he had just lost his job at @entity39 and was thinking of inventive ways to supplement his income			0
' especially in @entity2 , you have friends and it 's like , " did you see that new exhibit at @entity45 ? " " do you know what a @entity30 is ? " ' ' i live a few blocks from the @entity122 on 14th street , so i said , " let me wait in line for somebody else and make them happy , " ; he recalls			1
a man gave him $ 100 to wait in line before cancelling his request , saying he would buy the phone online instead - but he let him keep the money			1
so mr @entity9 sold his spot in line for another $ 100			1
then he collected milk crates from his house and sold them for $ 5 each to people who had been in line for hours and wanted a place to sit down			0
real deal : for longer waits , he brings a sleeping bag and a tent			0
' people want these things like it ¿ s the @entity145 , ' he said ( pictured : waiting for the first ever @entity147 sale in november ) all in all , he made $ 325 that day and realized he may have stumbled upon a lucrative business			0
now , he has seven people working for him as professional waiters and 15 more who have expressed their interest			0
' people want these things like it ’s the @entity145 , ' he told the @entity156 in november			0
' when i show up to their offices with a sleeping bag in one hand and the @entity30 in another , they know they 're getting their money 's worth			0

@entity9 and his team at @entity168 will wait for *sample* sales , @entity171 tickets , @entity173 *sneaker* releases , @entity175 product launches , talk shows , early *morning* audience lines and *celebrity* meet and *greets*
