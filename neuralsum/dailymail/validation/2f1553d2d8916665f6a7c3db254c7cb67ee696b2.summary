@entity0 has blasted federal regulators for being slow to approve commercial drone testing - and warned the @entity3 is falling behind other countries in the potentially lucrative area of unmanned aviation technology			1
less than a week after the @entity8 gave @entity0 the green light to test a delivery drone outdoors , the company told @entity3 lawmakers that the prototype drone had already become obsolete while the company waited more than six months for the agency 's permission			1
' we do n't test it anymore			2
we 've moved on to more advanced designs that we already are testing abroad , ' said @entity19 , @entity0 's vice president for global public policy			1
the aircraft can travel at more than 50mph and carry loads of up to 5 pounds			0
about 86 percent of @entity0 's deliveries are 5 pounds or less , the company said			1
' we believe customers will love it , and we are committed to making @entity28 available to customers worldwide as soon as we are permitted to do so , ' @entity0 has said			1
' nowhere outside of the @entity3 have we been required to wait more than one or two months to begin testing , ' @entity19 said in written testimony submitted to the @entity38 on @entity39			0
@entity19 said @entity0 had applied on friday for permission to test a more advanced drone system and now hopes for quicker approval			1
the @entity0 case illustrates the frustrations of many companies and industry lobbyists , who say the @entity3 regulatory process is not keeping up with rapidly developing drone technology that could generate new revenues and cost savings for a range of industries			1
@entity19 , who was scheduled to join a witness panel at the subcommittee hearing , said @entity57 and other international authorities have more ' reasonable ' approaches that recognize the potential economic benefits of commercial drone operations			2
' this low level of government attention and slow pace are inadequate , especially compared to the regulatory efforts in other countries , ' @entity19 said			0
' the ( @entity8 ) already has adequate statutory authority			1
what the @entity8 needs is impetus , lest the @entity3 fall further behind , ' he added			1
@entity69 - based @entity0 , the largest e-commerce company in the @entity3 , wants to use drones to deliver packages to its customers over distances of 10 miles ( 16 km ) or more , which would require drones to travel autonomously while equipped with technology to avoid collisions with other aircraft			2
the @entity8 recently proposed rules that would lift the current ban on most commercial drone flights , but several restrictions attached would make package delivery and other business applications unfeasible			1
among other constraints , the proposed rules would limit commercial drones to an altitude of 500 feet ( 150 metres ) , allow flights only during daytime and require operators to keep the aircraft in sight at all times			0
the agency does not expect to finalize the rules until late 2016 or early 2017 , according to government officials			0
during this period , the current ban will stay in place ; companies can apply for exemptions to use drones for specific business applications			0
the @entity8 has been slow to grant exemptions , however , granting only 48 of several hundred requests			2
the @entity106 - led subcommittee called the hearing to examine the agency 's efforts to integrate unmanned aircraft systems , or @entity111 , safely into @entity3 airspace			0
industry forecasters say that drones would generate nearly $ 14 billion of @entity3 economic activity in the first three years of integration and $ 82 billion over a decade			0
meanwhile , @entity118 , @entity119 , @entity120 and the @entity121 have progressed toward airspace integration and allow for commercial use , the @entity117 ( @entity117 ) said in a report to the subcommittee			0
@entity118 has granted operating certificates to 185 businesses , while several @entity57 countries have granted licenses to more than 1,000 operators , according to the report			0
while the @entity117 said overseas restrictions are similar to those proposed by the @entity8 , it noted that @entity120 has begun to allow beyond - line - of - sight operations on a limited basis			2
( additional reporting by @entity136 in @entity137 by @entity138 and @entity139 )			0
