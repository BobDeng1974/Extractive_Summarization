the @entity1 @entity0 said most employers could afford to pay the living wage the archbishop of @entity5 yesterday told all employers that they should pay the living wage – even though the @entity8 pays less to its own low - paid workers			1
the @entity1 @entity0 said that most businesses can afford to pay the living wage – which is at least £ 1.35 more than the minimum wage – and told them : ‘ just get on with it			1
’ he added in an interview with @entity16 : ‘ it can be done , and it should be done			0
it is not two holidays in @entity20 every year			0
’ however archbishop @entity0 rapidly came under criticism for telling other employers to do what the @entity8 refuses to do itself			2
one @entity25 mp , @entity24 , accused him of hypocrisy , saying : ‘ he should be getting his own house in order before he goes around lecturing everyone else			0
’ the row over the @entity8 and the living wage follows archbishop @entity0 ’s charge last week that ‘ there are entire towns and regions of our country that are being left trapped in an apparently inescapable economic downward spiral ’			1
in a contribution to a book edited by the @entity8 ’s number two , archbishop of york dr @entity43 , he called for ‘ solidarity ’ to replace individualism and consumerism			2
in the book , widely seen as an attempt by the @entity50 to intervene in the election campaign , he said the country should have an economic programme based on four ‘ essential building blocks ’ , with one of them the living wage			2
the @entity8 ’s failure to pay the living wage itself opens archbishop @entity0 to the same kind of embarrassment he suffered in 2013 when he pledged that the @entity8 would encourage credit unions to compete payday lender @entity62 ‘ out of existence ’			1
it then turned out that the @entity8 had a £ 75,000 investment in @entity62			0
the living wage is worked out , with the backing of charities and some major companies at a level calculated against the cost of living , to allow a decent standard of living			2
the idea has backing from both @entity74 and @entity75			0
it is set this year at £ 7.85 , and £ 9.15 in @entity77			1
this is higher than the government ’s legal minimum wage , which is currently £ 6.50 an hour			1
the @entity8 has 72 care workers employed by its @entity82 in supported housing schemes who are paid less than the living wage			1
it has promised that their pay will be raised to the @entity8 ’s recommended living wage level , but only gradually , ‘ in stages ’ , and only from april onwards			1
the pressure on employers from the archbishop to put workers onto the living wage now appears to contrast with the @entity8 ’s lethargy about raising the low wages of its own staff			1
the archbishop of york @entity43 ( left ) called for solidarity to replace consumerism and individualism archbishop @entity0 said in his contribution to the book published last week , on rock or @entity111 ? , that there were not only ‘ moral and economic arguments for paying a living wage but also a number of possible ways in which paying the living wage could have a positive multiplier effect in other aspects of life – including in educational attainment , health and family stability			2
’ mr @entity24 , mp for @entity118 , said that the @entity8 should not be telling other businesses to do what it was not prepared to do itself			0
‘ there are many small businesses around the country that might have considerably more difficulty raising wages than the @entity8 , ’ he said			0
‘ @entity0 might want to take the log out of his own eye before he complains about the speck in everybody else ’s			0
’ economist @entity130 of the @entity131 – herself an @entity8 – said : ‘ businesses have to stick to the law and pay the minimum wage			1
beyond that it has to be up to them what they pay people , according to what they can afford			0
‘ businesses have to pay enough to keep staff and they have to look out for their staff			0
they have to decide what is sensible pay for themselves			0
’ a spokesman for @entity0 said : ‘ the archbishop would want to see the workers paid the living wage as soon as feasibly possible			2

archbishop of @entity5 said all employers should pay living wage
the @entity8 pays less to its own low - paid workers , however
living wage is set at £ 7.85 and £ 9.15 in @entity77 , with at minimum wage at £ 6.50
