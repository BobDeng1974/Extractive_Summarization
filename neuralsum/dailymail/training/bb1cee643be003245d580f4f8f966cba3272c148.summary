by @entity0 published : 19:18 est , 5 june 2013 updated : 06:15 est , 6 june 2013 @entity1 today called on the @entity2 to pay £ 1.5million in tax allegedly avoided on a donation			1
the chancellor entered the row over shares given to @entity2 by businessman @entity8 , who claimed it was a ‘ tax efficient ’ arrangement agreed with senior @entity2 officials			1
labour leader @entity12 also faced questions about the affair , insisting the party would pay tax on any dividends it received			1
demand : chancellor @entity1 called on @entity2 to pay the tax owed after @entity20 revealed his £ 1.65million donation to @entity2 in january this year was made in the form of shares in his shopping channel company mr @entity20 revealed his £ 1.65million donation to @entity2 in january this year was made in the form of shares in his shopping channel company @entity26			1
he said the ‘ tax efficient ’ arrangement was agreed with senior @entity2 officials			2
tax experts said he would have had to pay almost £ 1.5million in tax if he had made the donation in cash			1
they suggested mr @entity20 would have had to earn £ 3.1million before tax to afford to make his donation in cash , with £ 1.46million going to @entity36			1
alternatively , if he had made the donation via a single cash dividend it would have attracted dividend tax at 30.5 per cent , leaving a bill of almost £ 725,000			1
the revelation is deeply embarrassing for @entity12 who has attacked the government over its failure to take robust action to tackle tax avoidance by wealthy individuals and corporations			1
in a letter to mr @entity12 this morning , @entity49 mr @entity1 challenged him : ' can you confirm that the @entity2 advised mr @entity20 on how to avoid tax on his donation ? ' most importantly , will you now pass the amount of tax that has been avoided to the exchequer ? ' the chancellor said the actions appeared to be ' directly at odds ' with mr @entity12 's public statements , adding that the money was ' needed to fund vital public services such as the health service and our schools '			1
however , mr @entity12 insisted @entity2 would pay tax every year on dividends from the shares			1
speaking in @entity68 , he said : ' my understanding of this is the reason @entity20 gave us the money in this way is that he wanted us to have a steady stream of income			2
' the @entity2 itself will be paying tax on these dividends			1
we are not avoiding tax			2
' write caption here @entity49 chairman @entity83 said the donation deal demonstrated the @entity86 ’s ‘ rank hypocrisy ’			2
he added : ‘ in public he slams tax avoidance , yet behind closed doors he ’s happy to rubber - stamp whopping donations from tax avoidance schemes			2
’ mr @entity20 told the @entity93 he would have had to give far more to provide @entity2 with the same level of assistance if he had used conventional means for making his donation			2
‘ to be honest with you , it is the most tax efficient way of doing this , ’ he said			0
‘ otherwise you get no tax relief on donations to political parties for understandable reasons			0
‘ if you donate to a political party out of a tax - paid income , up until april it was 50 per cent and now it is 45			0
that means if it is £ 100,000 , the @entity2 gets £ 55,000 and the government gets £ 45,000			0
’ mr @entity20 ’s donation – by far the biggest private donation received by @entity2 this year – is thought to be the first ever made to a political party in shares			1
he said the decision to use the controversial method had ‘ emerged ’ during discussions with senior @entity2 figures			0
‘ it emerged … came out of a discussion i had with them about the best way of doing it , ’ he said			0
‘ it is a good model ( for donating )			0
@entity2 has got people who deal with compliance and the legal side of all this			0
they are very sensitive nowadays			0
’ under the terms of the deal , @entity2 is reported to be the owner of the shares , which will be valued each year by the company ’s auditors			2
the party will receive an annual dividend payment on its shareholding			0
a @entity2 spokesman last night insisted the donation complied fully with electoral laws			0
he added : ‘ this donation has been declared in full to the @entity144 in line with party funding rules and it appears on the @entity144 ’s public register			0
it is standard practice to discuss donations ’ permissibility with the @entity144			0
