by @entity0 the @entity2 redevelopment project reached another milestone on thursday after the demolition of the final two houses on one side of the ground			1
the buildings in @entity9 , situated behind the main stand of @entity12 's 46,000 capacity ground , were brought down by bulldozers to mark the completion of another phase of the project			1
milestone : the last remained terraced house on @entity9 awaits demolition on wednesday old for new : the buildings in @entity9 are situated behind the main stand of the 46,000 capacity ground @entity24 , in conjunction with the football club , aim to redevelop and regenerate the community around @entity2 by mid- 2016			1
the £ 260 million project aims to create refurbished or new housing , a multi-use park space and greater numbers of commercial and retail premises			1
crucial to the project is the expansion of the stadium , which will see @entity12 play in front of almost 60,000 fans from the start of the 2016 - 17 season			2
the development remains controversial , even if it has received the endorsement of the vast majority of residents and officials			0
some residents remain uncertain as to what benefit they will get from the project and are disappointed by the lack of communication they have received from the council throughout the demolition process			0
the future : @entity12 's plans for @entity2 will see the capacity grow to almost 60,000 expansion : the main stand will house an extra 8,500 seats and the @entity2 stand will take another 4,800 @entity59 , speaking to the @entity58 earlier this year , claimed she has been ' left in limbo ' by the council			1
she feels that ' everything is to suit the @entity2 stadium and @entity12 , ' as opposed to the future of the surrounding community and its residents			2
indeed in may @entity24 had to consider seeking compulsory purchase powers in order to acquire the final few properties owned by those less keen to sell up			0
on the other hand many see this latest demolition phase as another step forward in an exciting project , with one property owner in the area told the @entity58 ' people are happy again , ' since the commencement of the redevelopment work			2
moving on up : @entity12 finished second in the @entity80 and will hope to continue that success the football club will benefit from a greatly increased capacity			0
@entity84 led the @entity85 to @entity87 football last season , with the team narrowly missing out on winning a first league title since 1990			1
the @entity85 boss will be relishing the possibility of @entity94 nights in front of an additional 15,000 supporters after the completion of the project			0
the fact that the club are remaining at @entity2 , rather than finding somewhere to build a new stadium is also seen as a significant benefit of the upheaval in the area			2
@entity12 captain @entity105 believes the club ’s rich history will be consolidated within an improved @entity2			0
he said in 2012 : ' a lot of history and important things have happened at @entity2 and i think it is fantastic @entity12 are staying there			0

buildings in @entity9 demolished as redevelopment gathers pace
@entity2 's capacity will increase by nearly 15,000 to 60,000 by 2016
the £ 260m project will also aim to refurbish or create housing in the area
@entity2 will see @entity87 football for the first time in five years
