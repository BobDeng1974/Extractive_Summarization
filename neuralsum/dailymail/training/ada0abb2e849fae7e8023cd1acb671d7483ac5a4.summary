former vice president @entity0 believes that a terrorist attack even worse than the destruction of the twin towers on september 11 , 2001 is probable before the end of the decade			1
@entity0 appeared on @entity7 ’s radio show on tuesday and was asked if he thought the @entity10 would ‘ get through this decade without another massive attack on the homeland			1
’ ‘ i doubt it , ’ @entity0 said			1
‘ i think there will be another attack and the next time i think it ’s likely to be far deadlier than the last one			0
‘ basically , it involved having a government in waiting if you will ready to go in the event of nuclear attack on the @entity10 so that we could always maintain the constitutional - based governmental authority , ’ he explained			1
‘ we operated and actually trained under circumstances of how would we go about providing for a government to survive if we were having nuclear weapons from the @entity43 falling all over the country			0
’ @entity0 and his daughter @entity45 last week announced the launch of @entity47 , which they ’ve described as a ‘ grassroots organization that will advocate for a restoration of @entity10 strength and power			1
’ video : @entity0 predicts a terrorist attack ' far deadlier ' than 9/11 @entity55 : @entity0 and his daughter @entity45 - a former deputy assistant secretary of state - have harsh words for @entity59 's handling of the insurgency in @entity61 the @entity62 have posted a video to @entity64 about their organization , which the video ’s description says will attack ' the dangerous policies of the @entity69 ' and promises to keep ' policies necessary to protect the nation ' in the spotlight			1
concerning the current situation in @entity61 , the @entity62 oppose the president 's plan for the uprising and are critical of his actions before the uprisings that allowed the jihadi group @entity79 ( @entity80 ) to grow			1
' rarely has a @entity10 president been so wrong about so much at the expense of so many , ' the @entity62 wrote in an op - ed for the @entity83 last week			1
' too many times to count , mr. @entity59 has told us he is " ending " the wars in @entity61 and @entity88 — as though wishing made it so			1
' his rhetoric has now come crashing into reality			0
watching the black - clad @entity80 jihadists take territory once secured by @entity10 blood is final proof , if any were needed , that @entity10 's enemies are not " decimated			0
" they are emboldened and on the march			0
' fore ! the @entity62 say that while the situation in @entity61 escalates , @entity59 is playing golf and talking about climate change the @entity62 contend that the uprising in @entity61 is not just a threat to @entity61 , but to @entity10 , as well , as the country could become a safe - haven for @entity105 and other terrorist groups that could carry out 9/11 - style attacks on the @entity10 and its allies			1
the @entity62 mention trips they 've been on to the @entity110 , where government officials are confused as to what @entity59 has been doing in the region following the wars in @entity115 and @entity88 , and say that the president is abandoning the few friends the @entity10 has in the @entity119 world			1
' in one @entity119 capital , a senior official pulled out a map of @entity123 and @entity61 , ' the @entity62 write			1
' drawing an arc with his finger from @entity127 province in northern @entity123 to @entity126 in western @entity61 , he said , " they will control this territory			1
@entity105 is building safe havens and training camps here			0
do n't the @entity10 care ? " ' our president does n't seem to			0
@entity61 is at risk of falling to a radical @entity79 terror group and mr. @entity59 is talking climate change			1
' terrorists take control of more territory and resources than ever before in history , and he goes golfing			0
he seems blithely unaware , or indifferent to the fact , that a resurgent @entity105 presents a clear and present danger to the @entity10			0
' brutal : @entity80 crucified this man and left a note on his body saying ' cleanliness is a civilized matter that shows ur ethics and love for country after the @entity154 , the @entity62 say @entity105 was nearly defeated in the country thanks primarily to military efforts by the @entity10 and its allies			0
rather than stay in the country and make sure the peace was preserved , @entity59 pulled the @entity10 out of the unfinished conflict , according to the @entity62			2
mr. @entity59 had only to negotiate an agreement to leave behind some residual @entity10 forces , training and intelligence capabilities to help secure the peace			2
instead , he abandoned @entity61 and we are watching @entity10 defeat snatched from the jaws of victory			2
the @entity62 cite a @entity171 study that shows a 58 percent increase in the number of salafi - jihadists between 2010 and 2013			0
they say that ' in the face of this threat , mr. @entity59 is busy ushering @entity10 's adversaries into positions of power in the @entity110			2
' ' first it was the @entity181 in @entity123			0
now , in a move that defies credulity , he toys with the idea of ushering @entity185 into @entity61 , ' they write			2
' only a fool would believe @entity10 policy in @entity61 should be ceded to @entity185 , the world 's largest state sponsor of terror			2
' violence : the number of @entity61 executed by @entity80 since the uprising began is in the thousands they write that there is ' a dire need for @entity10 leadership around the world ' and that the president has failed our allies by abandoning conflicts before they are actually over			1
' it is time the president and his allies faced some hard truths : @entity10 remains at war , and withdrawing troops from the field of battle while our enemies stay in the fight does not " end " wars			2
weakness and retreat are provocative			0
@entity10 withdrawal from the world is disastrous and puts our own security at risk , ' the @entity62 write			0
they went on to quote former president - and conservative hero - @entity227			2
in 1983 , president @entity227 said , " if history teaches anything , it teaches that simple - minded appeasement or wishful thinking about our adversaries is folly			0
it means the betrayal of our past , the squandering of our freedom			0
" president @entity59 is on track to securing his legacy as the man who betrayed our past and squandered our freedom .			1
