the @entity0 , the government science research organisation , is shutting down its bowel cancer and neurological research programs , due to budget cuts to the organisation			1
@entity0 announced the closure of the research programs , which investigate treatment and early detection strategies for colo - rectal and bowel cancers , as well as neurological illnesses such as dementia and @entity13 's			1
the program closures result from cuts to @entity0 funding announced in the most recent federal budget , which stripped $ 115 million of funding from @entity0 , forcing a a 20 percent reduction of staff between june 2013 and june 2015			1
@entity0 research scientist dr @entity21 is working with live @entity23 samples at a high containment laboratory in @entity25			0
his department will suffer eight redundancies ' it 's not a throwaway line about making @entity0 more efficient , these budget cuts directly result in shutting down areas of research , and we want our elected representatives to be more transparent about that , ' @entity0 staff association secretary @entity28 told @entity37			1
' you 're essentially down to the bare bones , there 's not a lot left to cut			0
we want to make people making these decisions accountable as to what happens as a result			0
' due to funding cuts last year , there were 513 redundancies at @entity0 , reducing their total workforce from 6,500 by eight percent , to 5,964 in june 2013			2
it is estimated that another 750 jobs will be cut across the organisation in the next financial year , meaning @entity0 will suffer a 20 percent reduction of staff in two years			1
overall @entity0 will lose 20 percent of its staff in two years , necessitating the closure of the bowel cancer and neurological illness research programs @entity60 ceo @entity59 said the closure of @entity0 's bowel and rectal cancer research program was ' a step backwards ' , especially given that bowel cancer is the second biggest cancer killer in @entity67			1
' any cuts to bowel cancer are of serious concern			2
15,000 people are diagnosed each year , and funding to bowel cancer research currently does n't reflect the burden of disease accurately in this country , ' he told @entity37			1
he stated that while bowel cancer accounts for around 13 percent of all cancer diagnosis , research funding has typically not reflected the burden of disease , receiving between 7 and 10 percent of @entity81 funding for cancer research and treatment			1
while there are other government , not - for - profit and commercial groups engaged in bowel cancer research , mr @entity59 pointed to @entity0 's involvement in developing a blood test for bowel cancer that is currently being piloted in the @entity91 for people who can not or will not carry out screening with the recommended stool test			2
' it 's really a sad day for bowel cancer			0
' the areas of @entity0 that will suffer job cuts have not been fully announced , but are set to include 40 jobs across both the colorectal cancer and neurosciences research areas , and eight full - time researchers from @entity102 ( @entity102 ) in @entity25 who investigate bio-security threats to humans that can be transmitted from animals			2

' these latest cuts to @entity0 are particularly illogical and short - sighted , ' he said			0
' we want to make people making these decisions accountable			0

@entity0 forced to close down research programs into bowel cancer and neurological diseases
bowel cancer is the second biggest cancer killer in @entity67 and does not receive funding equal to the burden of the disease
budget cuts means @entity0 will lose 20 percent of all staff
@entity0 union secretary said the organisation was already down to the ' bare bones ' and morale was ' despondent '
