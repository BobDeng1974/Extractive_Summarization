scientists could be on the brink of developing a cure for blindness , after regrowing corneas in the laboratory			0
the team behind the study at the @entity8 and @entity9 in the @entity10 believe the milestone could help reverse a leading cause of blindness			0
a major breakthrough in stem cell research allowed researchers to grow the first known tissue from an adult stem cell			1
the scientists say their work offers hope to burn victims , victims of chemical injury and people with damaging eye diseases			1
scientists at the @entity8 and @entity9 in the @entity10 believe they have made a breakthrough , regrowing corneas in a study which could pave the way for a cure for blindness they have identified a way to enhance regrowth of human corneal tissue to restore vision , using a molecule known as @entity38 , which acts as a marker for hard - to - find limbal stem cells			1
the research , published in the journal nature , is also one of the first known examples of constructing a tissue from an adult - derived human stem cell			1
@entity48 stem cells are found in the eye ’s basal limbal epithelium , or limbus , and help maintain and regenerate corneal tissue			1
their loss due to injury or disease is one of the leading causes of blindness			0
previously , tissue or cell transplants have been used to help the cornea regenerate			0
but until now it was not known whether there were actual limbal stem cells in the grafts and outcomes were not consistent			2
in the new study , researchers were able to use antibodies detecting @entity38 , to pinpoint the stem cells in tissue from dead human donors and use them to regrow anatomically correct , fully functional human corneas in mice			1
the team at the @entity8 and @entity9 managed to identify a molecule known as @entity38 , which acts as a marker for hard - to - find limbal stem cells			1
@entity48 stem cells help maintain and regenerate corneal tissue			1
their loss due to injury or disease is one of the leading causes of blindness the study ’s co-lead author doctor @entity86 , who worked alongside dr @entity88 , said : ' @entity48 stem cells are very rare , and successful transplants are dependent on these rare cells			2
' this finding will now make it much easier to restore the corneal surface			0
it ’s a very good example of basic research moving quickly to a translational application			0
' co-author dr @entity97 said : ' @entity38 allows limbal stem cells to survive , protecting them from apoptosis [ programmed cell death ]			2
' dr @entity101 added : ' the mouse model allowed us for the first time to understand the role of @entity38 in normal development , and should be very important to the stem cell field in general			2
' a single lab can not do a study like this			0
' it integrates genetics , knockout mice , antibodies , transplantation - a lot of technical expertise that we were lucky came together in a very nice way			0

scientists in the @entity10 have successfully regrown corneas from stem cells
team believe breakthrough could give hope to burns victims , those injured in chemical *attacks* and people *battling* eye diseases
one of the first known examples of growing tissue from an adult stem cell
