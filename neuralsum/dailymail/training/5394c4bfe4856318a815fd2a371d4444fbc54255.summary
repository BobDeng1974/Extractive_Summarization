click here for the stats from the game with our brilliant @entity4 service technically , it made no difference			2
@entity8 were still going to need to beat @entity9 , either way			1
yet as @entity11 rose to head in an 88th - minute equaliser , a little bit of the hoped - for @entity16 revival died			1
they could n’t hold the lead			2
they could n’t get it over the line			0
forget the permutations , the blow was psychological			0
if @entity8 take the lead at @entity26 in their final group game next month , there will be no great confidence that it will be maintained			1
and a draw puts @entity9 through			0
one can almost feel the dread from here			0
on the bright side , @entity8 are still in there fighting			1
maybe they would have settled for that , coming out of the 3 - 0 defeat by @entity36			2
they could have gone out , too			0
so could a lot of teams			0
@entity8 's @entity41 and @entity42 look dejected after @entity43 ( not pictured ) scored for @entity40 @entity11 ( third left ) scores a late header to make it 2 - 2 to leave @entity8 having to beat @entity9 in their final game to progress @entity11 runs off in celebration after scoring the equaliser for @entity40 in the final minutes against @entity8 @entity49 , @entity50 and other @entity8 players look dejected as they contemplate a long flight back to @entity53 @entity41 and @entity49 look disappointed as they clap the travelling @entity8 fans after the final whistle @entity40 : @entity57 5 , @entity58 6.5 , @entity59 4 , @entity11 6 , @entity60 5.5 , @entity61 6.5 , @entity62 6.5 , @entity63 7 ( @entity64 80 5 ) , @entity65 6 ( @entity66 72 5.5 ) , @entity67 6.5 , @entity68 7 ( @entity69 69 5 )			1

not @entity36 ; not even @entity8			1
but the elite have been travelling to tricky corners of @entity98 like this for decades and occasionally coming unstuck			0
the @entity104 era national stadium			0
bitter cold and a horrible pitch			0
we used to watch grainy footage of @entity8 in action on nights like this in the days when the competition was called the @entity114			1
they were never easy games			2
@entity8 had held their lead for close to an hour when the mounting @entity40 pressure told			1
it was a corner , one of a number late on			2
this one found @entity11 , a @entity123 international who once had an unsuccessful trial with @entity125 , powering his header past @entity76			2
at that point the hope that this would be a watershed night evaporated			0
far from building confidence , it became further evidence of @entity8 ’s frailty			2
@entity132 got sent off here , at the @entity134 , in what might be termed the good old days			0
now he watched from the press box , quietly anxious about the way @entity8 were being pressed back deeper by @entity40 ’ ambition			1
what @entity8 would give for a defender of his composure on nights like this			2
for a goalkeeper like @entity146 or even @entity147 , too			0
from the third minute , when they fell behind , to the very end as @entity40 pressed and pressed , @entity8 were nervy at the back			1
they rode their luck a little , too			0
it may have been a penalty when @entity77 fouled @entity65 in the second half , but referee @entity153 of @entity94 gave it outside the box			0
sadly , @entity76 , whose penalty save against @entity157 was a catalyst for the run that took @entity8 to within touching distance of the title last season , is no longer part of the solution , but a large slice of the problem			2
he was at fault for the first goal here , even if it was @entity79 ’s initial mistake that put @entity8 on the back foot			1
@entity49 roars with joy as he celebrates his goal with captain @entity41 @entity49 taps the ball past @entity40 goalkeeper @entity57 to put @entity8 in front @entity42 reacts after missing a chance to score past @entity40 ' goalkeeper @entity57 @entity79 cleared the ball straight to @entity67 — one of five @entity180 in the @entity40 squad — and he struck a low shot from just outside the area			1
it was powerful but straight and should have presented little problem for a top - class goalkeeper			0
@entity76 ’s attempt to gather it into his body was pitiful			0
the ball rebounded off his chest and striker @entity68 , late of @entity192 in @entity94 , was first to react , prodding it into the net from close range			1
it was not the only time @entity76 ’s handling caused concern			0
every shot he faced he reacted to as if it had exploded out of a @entity201 directly in front of him			0
the pitch was partly to blame for that , calling into question @entity8 ’s decision to train at @entity208 rather than out here			2
no goalkeeper will ever get used to an inconsistent bounce like this , but @entity76 might not have looked so startled each time it happened			0
these were not the only nasty instances			0
@entity76 completely missed a cross into his box in the first half — and thankfully so did everybody else — while @entity79 almost put a low ball from @entity65 into his own net			0
@entity40 ' @entity65 ( left ) has his cross blocked by @entity8 's @entity79 @entity8 's @entity78 ( left ) makes a challenge on @entity40 ' @entity61 @entity225 frustrated after late equaliser @entity8 manager @entity227 tries to get instructions across to his players from the touchline @entity41 wins a tussle for the ball with @entity67 ( left ) of @entity233 at the @entity234 @entity8 can only advance to the round of 16 if they beat @entity9 at @entity26 on the final matchday			1
remaining games : december 9 - @entity8 vs @entity9 , @entity36 vs @entity40			1
in the 33rd minute , a shot from 30 yards by @entity63 pitched in a rough patch and almost biffed @entity76 on the nose as he sought to collect it			0
by then , @entity8 were wobbling			2
this being a charmed week for @entity246 clubs in @entity98 , however , eight minutes before half - time , @entity227 ’ team were ahead			1
@entity40 had probably edged the action , but like @entity249 against @entity250 , fortune favoured the @entity246 and @entity40 let them back into the game with two errors : the second a lapse , but the first a real horror show			1
@entity49 played a long , rather aimless , ball into the box , but it seemed to catch goalkeeper @entity57 and defender @entity59 in two minds — and neither of them were worthy of an application to @entity261			2
@entity42 is congratulated by @entity82 and @entity79 after his header made it 1 - 1 @entity42 celebrates with @entity81 as his goal made it 1 - 1 at the at @entity234 @entity42 heads @entity8 level in the first half with his second goal for @entity8 as many games @entity42 had a good game and got around the middle of the pitch as well as fulfilling his defensive duties - as his heat map shows @entity82 ( left ) goes on the attack for @entity8 but is tracked by @entity276 defender @entity59 @entity59 dawdled , @entity57 froze and @entity42 popped in between them and sent a header on a gentle trajectory into the far corner			1
it was the sort of goal that had the whole stadium looking to the linesman , expecting to see the flag that had signalled for play to stop			0
ludogorets were truly that dozy : and five minutes after going behind , @entity8 were level again			1
they created little after that , though , and a shot from @entity82 that rose high over the bar seemed to sum up the difference in form from last season			0
yet with 37 minutes gone , @entity8 got the goal that should have changed the dynamic of their campaign			1
it came around the time that , over in @entity9 , @entity302 was giving @entity36 the lead to greatly improve @entity8 ’s chances of progress — and while @entity49 could not have known the news , he responded to @entity82 ’s cross with an urgency that implied he did			1
@entity40 midfielder @entity68 celebrates after scoring the opening goal with team - mates @entity68 celebrates his goal as he gives @entity40 a shock lead in the first half @entity40 ' @entity68 ( left ) scores the first goal against @entity8 in the third minute @entity49 has never scored for @entity315 and one might ask why , considering the @entity317 energy he displayed to arrive at the far post here , timing his run perfectly and finishing from a tight angle to give @entity8 a gasp of breathing space			1
the marking could have been tighter , but that was true at either end			0
for @entity8 , however , the defensive problem is growing			2
the starting point against @entity9 is a clean sheet — yet who has any confidence of the night finishing that way ? @entity41 vies for the ball with @entity40 ' midfielder from @entity67 and comes out on top @entity8 fans make themselves heard during the @entity114 clash in @entity123 @entity41 ( left ) control the ball next to @entity40 ' @entity337 during the first half @entity62 ( left ) goes to ground as he fights for the ball with @entity50 of @entity8 @entity8 's @entity78 ( right ) fights for the ball with @entity40 ' @entity61 fans light a flare as they watch the early stages of @entity40 ' game with @entity8 the @entity8 substitutes keep warm on the bench as they watch their team - mates in action in @entity123			1

@entity40 took the lead early in the first half through @entity68
@entity8 hit back with a goal from @entity42 - his second in as many games
the @entity356 went ahead late in the first half through @entity49
but @entity11 headed @entity40 level in the dying minutes to rescue a point for the hosts
