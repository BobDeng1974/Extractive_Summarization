by @entity0 it took three years to build , cost more than $ 77m and 28 workmen lost their lives during its construction , but when it was finally completed in 1936 , three years after work first began , @entity7 was the largest in the world , spanning some 7,180metres making it nearly 4.5 miles long			1
and these spectacular pictures charting the dramatic rise of the monolithic construction have gone on display for what is believed to be the first time since they were taken all those years ago			1
the images were were captured by a plucky young wannabe photographer who went by the name of @entity22			1
nervous : @entity22 was just 21 when he took the ferry to @entity25 , where workmen gathered before being taken across the bay for their day 's work professional : @entity22 ( left ) in 1971			2
right , wo workers take a breather to check the bridge 's progress nerves of steel : in 1934 @entity22 made climbed to the top of @entity7			1
it was the first of many trips the 21 - year - old photographer was to make by the time the structure was completed two years later in 1934 @entity22 , 21 , took the ferry from his @entity7 home across to the @entity25 side where workers were gathering before heading out to work on the @entity7			1
a man with a hammer in his hand decided to test the nerve of the young man who had a camera in his hand			0
he goaded @entity22 , saying : ' hey kid , why do n't you come out with us ? you 'll get some good pictures			2
' not one to pass up on an opportunity like that , @entity22 jumped on board and rode out to the first tower , which was under construction			2
do n't look down : workers risk their lives during the construction of the suspension bridge work in progress : when @entity22 took this picture there was still some way to go before the two sides of @entity71 were joined up he went , scampering and shimmying along the cables and catwalks , as high as any worker was willing to take him , then a little higher in order to get a picture of him			1
by the time he came back down it was 1936 , the bridge was completed , and he had a body of work that would outlast anything else he would do			0
that was no mean feat. during his career , @entity22 , one of @entity84 's first staff photographers , was to shoot no fewer than 26 covers for the iconic publication , including sessions with @entity91 stars			0
he died in 1997 aged 83			0
when ' @entity22 : bridging the @entity71 ' opens saturday at the @entity93 , it will mark the first time the museum 's full set of his bridge pictures has been shown since the photos were acquired , and that took 20 years to gather 20 images for the collection			1
men only : 8,300 workers came together to build the bridge , all of whom were men			0
right , @entity7 had the deepest piers in the world			0
there was even a rumour a man had been buried in the centre one , but it turned out to be a prank backdrop : two businessmen discuss the big news of the day , while a man and a young boy look out across the bay massive undertaking : it took three years to complete the bridge and 28 men lost their lives in its construction signal man : a worker directs some heavy lifting equipment into position			0
@entity130 , the view from the ground			0

*stunning* pictures taken by a young *snapper* during the construction of @entity7 have gone on display
the photos were taken over a two - year period by *aspiring* photographer @entity22 , 21
@entity22 later said the pictures he took , many from *dizzying* heights high above @entity71 , were his finest
