@entity0 : the essence of innovation in creative pairs by @entity4 @entity4 has hit upon the interesting notion that creativity can not occur in a vacuum			1
even a proud , solitary genius such as @entity10 was motivated and impelled by his rivalry with @entity12 and @entity13			1
@entity15 ’s poems utilised ‘ imagery and ideas ’ from his sister @entity16 ’s journals , and behind @entity18 was his brother , @entity19 , his business manager and dealer			1
‘ they lost patience with each other			1
they made each other furious			1
but they also spurred and served each other			2
’ @entity19 , in his polished boots and pressed suit , has been eclipsed in history by the bohemian @entity18 , a mess in his patched trousers — but , without the former man ’s diligence , we ’d not have had the other ’s electric achievement			2
@entity38 would have been a great actor if given the chance and was once offered a straight role			1
he was about to accept when @entity41 intervened and would n’t let him thus , in this fascinating study of ‘ the intricate , intense interdependency between people ’ , the conclusion seems to be that ‘ when we go back and forth , our ideas , our ambitions , our efficiency , our ability — everything gets bigger ’			2
the more we overlap and collaborate , the larger we become , ‘ much larger than we were as two individuals ’			2
this can be true of authors , such as @entity55 and @entity56 , who depend often on unacknowledged editors to shape ‘ unwieldy manuscripts ’			2
politicians have speech - writers and aides behind the scenes , whether lowly @entity63 , or @entity64 and @entity65			1
( mrs @entity66 once said of @entity67 : ‘ every prime minister needs a @entity69 ’ )			2
even famous politicians like @entity64 and @entity65 relied on their speech writers pop performers , in particular , are heavily dependent on producers , promoters and studio engineers			1
it is with famous double acts , however , that ‘ an unmistakeable psychological union ’ takes place , which goes down ‘ to the bedrock of cognition ’			2
@entity82 and @entity83 , when formulating psychoanalysis , exchanged 337 letters , in which their handwriting and linguistic style merged			2
they could literally ‘ finish each other ’s sentences ’ , says @entity4			1
@entity91 , of @entity92 , calls this the blissful state of being able to get on to a ‘ high bandwidth ’ with a soulmate : ‘ wordless communication that observers commonly describe as telepathic ’			2
@entity99 and @entity100 achieved this symbiosis			1
meeting in a group called the @entity104 to drink beer and discuss elves , they shared a love affair with @entity109 literature and @entity111 sagas			2
out of this , @entity112 and @entity113 were generated			2
when reading out pages of their manuscripts , ‘ praise for good work was unstinted , but censure for bad work was often brutally frank ’			2
though based in a @entity122 , rather than an @entity123 , inn , @entity125 and @entity126 were similar , ‘ working in the same cafe at separate tables ’			0
@entity99 and @entity100 achieved this symbiosis			1
meeting in a group called the @entity104 to drink beer and discuss elves , they shared a love affair with @entity109 literature and @entity111 sagas with @entity137 and @entity138 , who together discovered the structure of @entity140 at @entity142 ’s @entity141 , the creative enterprise was seen to be selfless			1
these two filled gaps in each other ’s knowledge and , ‘ when one of us got on the wrong track , the other one got out of it ’			0
they only fell out away from the lab , when @entity137 published an autobiography that @entity138 thought ‘ a violation of friendship that grossly invaded my privacy ’			0
the story is not as straight - forward as @entity4 presents it			1
@entity138 and @entity137 were heavily reliant upon the research and innovations of @entity161 , who did n’t share the @entity162 with them only because she was a woman — a shameful episode			0
@entity165 and @entity166 had a voluble , prickly partnership from the start			1
@entity4 writes brilliantly of the psychology behind @entity170			1
@entity172 was meticulous and organised , @entity5 ‘ seemed to live in chaos ’			0
‘ he was constantly searching for scraps of paper he ’d hurriedly scribbled ideas on			0
@entity172 was the diplomat , @entity5 the agitator ’			0
they were so creatively and claustrophobically entangled , a split was inevitable — @entity178 was @entity5 ’s escape route			0
@entity165 and @entity166 had a voluble , prickly partnership from the start			1
@entity4 writes brilliantly of the psychology behind @entity170			1
@entity172 was meticulous and organised , @entity5 ‘ seemed to live in chaos ’			0
as @entity187 summed up : ‘ @entity5 needed @entity172 ’s attention to detail and persistence , @entity172 needed @entity5 ’s anarchic , lateral thinking			0
’ the dependence , the proximity , can lead to resentment			1
ballerina @entity192 became the muse of choreographer @entity194			0
they had a ‘ silent understanding ’ , leading to great work on the @entity198 stage			1
but ‘ four times had @entity194 married his lead ballerinas ’			1
he ’d be inspired , drain them , move on — a real - life version of the vampire theme in @entity204			1
to be a distinct pair yet only recognised as a unity can fester into hatred — as with @entity208 and @entity209			0
their comical slapstick fights became real , and they went from ‘ rambunctious friends to wary enemies ’ , not speaking for years			0
authors such as @entity56 depend often on editors to shape ‘ unwieldy manuscripts ’ @entity217 reintroduced them , but it was as painful and awkward as former spouses meeting again decades hence			0
what @entity4 calls ‘ the essential dynamics between pairs ’ is like an intense marriage , even if the partners are brothers			1
@entity226 did nothing but squabble , but enjoyed the animosity			0
‘ i love to scrap with @entity231			0
@entity231 is a good scrapper , ’ said @entity230			0
@entity18 , however , could n’t cope with the idea of @entity19 having any sort of existence beyond just the pair of them			0
it was when @entity19 announced his engagement that @entity18 chopped his ear off			0
when @entity242 chose to move to @entity243 and break up his double act with @entity241 , @entity241 told @entity245 it was ‘ a divorce ’ , pure and simple			0
it had been a marriage of two minds ; together and separate , side by side and neck and neck , the comedians had undertaken ‘ parallel missions that intertwined ’ , the one man mutually reinforcing the invention of the other			0
without such a structure , @entity241 drank himself to death			0
@entity4 does n’t , in fact , feature @entity241 and @entity242 , but a @entity262 version of his book ought to be commissioned , which could investigate the partnerships of @entity266 and @entity267 , @entity268 , @entity269 and @entity270 , @entity271 and @entity272 , the @entity273 , @entity275 duo @entity274 and @entity276 , @entity277 and @entity278 , and @entity279			1
@entity38 , for example , a great actor if given the chance , was once offered a straight role			1
he was about to accept when @entity41 intervened and would n’t let him			0
i hate @entity285 for having the power to do that .			0

@entity4 says creativity can not occur in a vacuum
from @entity165 and @entity166 to @entity99 and @entity100 - great partnerships have always produced great creative results
even politicians have speech - writers and aides behind the scenes , whether lowly @entity63 , or @entity64 and @entity65
but the dependence and proximity can lead to resentment
