by @entity0 follow @ @ the_topspin @entity1 has used the occasion of the star - studded lord ’s bicentenary match to claim he would love to play for @entity5 again , insisting ‘ cricket ’s never been the issue ’ and pointing out that he is yet to retire from the game			1
six months after being sacked by the @entity9 following a breakdown in trust between him and senior figures in the @entity5 dressing - room , @entity1 will line up for @entity15 ’s @entity17 team against an @entity19 side led by @entity20 in a game to commemorate 200 years of cricket ’s most famous club at @entity24 on saturday			1
as a cast list of current and recently retired cricketing stars assembled at the home of cricket on friday , @entity1 began by posting a picture on @entity30			1
looking to the future : @entity1 still hopes to play for @entity5 again one day short form : @entity1 has predominantly been playing @entity34 cricket of late all smiles : @entity1 at @entity24 on friday with @entity15 ahead of the @entity19 200 - year celebration match ‘ my space reserved in the @entity4 ’s dressing room , ’ he wrote			1
‘ clothes ready ! so excited about tomorrow			2
i did n’t think i ’d have this opportunity to play in front of a full house at @entity24 again			1
i still do hope that things change and i play for @entity5 here again			1
@entity44 will tell ... ’ if it was possible to dismiss that as an off - the - cuff piece of wistfulness , then @entity1 later reiterated his desire to resume an international career that most observers believe came to an end following the @entity53 in january			1
since then , @entity1 has agreed a severance package with the @entity9 , embarked on a new life as a @entity34 freelancer , and begun a newspaper column in which his thoughts on @entity60 ’s struggling side have trodden a fine line between constructive criticism and thinly veiled schadenfreude			1
in another move unlikely to endear him to @entity60 , @entity1 attended the recent lord ’s test against @entity67 alongside @entity68 , who has dubbed the @entity5 captain ‘ a repulsive little weasel ’			1
primed : @entity1 shared this image of his shirt and message on @entity30 the kindest interpretation is that a rapprochement could be tricky			2
and yet , with a high - profile five - @entity53 series against @entity77 beginning on wednesday , @entity1 claims he has not given up hope of mending the various bridges that have been burned over the last few months			1
‘ i ’d love to play for @entity5 again , ’ he said in the @entity4 ’s @entity80			1
‘ i ’ve still got hope			0
’ asked how he thought this might come about , he replied : ‘ i ’ve got a phone in my pocket			0
i ’ve got a pretty good resumé			0
it ’s not the cricket			2
’ did he really think he might add to his 104 test caps ? ‘ i do n’t think it might happen			0
i live in hope every day			0
i ’m 34 , i ’m young			2
i ’ve got a good resumé			0
if things change one day , i ’ll gladly accept the opportunity , because i love playing for @entity5			2
if i did n’t love it , i ’d have retired			0
but i have n’t retired			0
’ when it was put to @entity1 that the parting of the ways between him and @entity5 appeared to be final , he replied : ‘ not from me			1
i ’d love to play again			2
short on form : @entity1 refused to be drawn on whether @entity60 should step down as captain disaster : @entity5 were beaten in every form of the game by @entity67 on their recent tour ‘ i never lost interest when i played for @entity5			1
every single day i wanted to improve			0
i had ambitions , i had goals			0
i probably needed a couple of months out with my knee , for sure			0
but that seems to have got back working ok			0
it ’s just a case of hoping the phone rings one day			0
’ would he consider playing four - day cricket for @entity116 in a bid to prove his readiness for a shock return to the test team ? ‘ no. cricket ’s never been the issue			1
i ’ve played 104 test matches , i ’ve got enough runs			0
’ @entity1 was heartened by the reception he received from fellow - diners at a special meal on thursday evening at @entity24			1
‘ i sat next to one of the @entity19 officials , and they said : “ wow , that was amazing			2
” i know the support has been incredible since january			0
’ but the likelihood is that the man hailed by @entity15 as an ‘ absolute matchwinner , a superstar and a wonderful player ’ really has represented @entity5 for the last time			2
there was a moment of self - depreciation when @entity1 described himself as ‘ the genuine out - and - out clubbie , playing once a week ’			2
the sadness is this is n’t too far from the truth			0
barring one of the most improbable u-turns in the history of cricket , @entity1 ’s appearance on saturday could be his last in this country outside the confines of the domestic game			1
do n’t expect him to go out with a whimper .			0

@entity1 says he still has *n't* given up on international cricket
34 - year - old refused to comment on whether @entity60 should step down as @entity5 captain
@entity1 urged @entity5 *selectors* to be ' braver ' in their *selections*
@entity116 *batsman* will play in @entity19 v @entity164 at @entity24 on saturday
