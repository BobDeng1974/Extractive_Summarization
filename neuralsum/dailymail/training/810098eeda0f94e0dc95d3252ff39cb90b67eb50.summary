as the birthplace of sir @entity2 , @entity0 has a special place in @entity5 history			1
so it is with some astonishment that traditionalist visitors to the @entity10 stately home have found its grand apartments filled with modern art by @entity14 dissident @entity13 – including a giant pair of wooden handcuffs			1
and they are not happy , filling the visitors ’ book in the chapel with angry complaints , accusing the exhibition of ‘ defacing ’ the @entity22 ’ ancestral home			0
' out of place ' : a piece called @entity26 2012 , which is made up of dozens of porcelain crabs that cover the floor of the elegant @entity29 , above , is part of @entity13 's exhibition at @entity0 defaced : in the @entity32 is a 5,000 - year - old @entity34 vase which @entity13 has painted with a @entity36 logo heritage : visitors to @entity0 , above , have heavily criticised the modern art show in the apartments @entity13 is perhaps most famous in this country for letting art lovers explore some 100 million porcelain sunflower seeds in the @entity44 ’s @entity43 in 2010 – a display which fell foul of health and safety legislation when the exhibit was found to create hazardous dust			1

birthplace : the future pm , at the age of five one of the most controversial objects in the exhibition is a pair of wooden handcuffs , created by the artist in 2012			2
they have been placed on the bed in the room where @entity102 gave birth to the former prime minister in 1874			0
