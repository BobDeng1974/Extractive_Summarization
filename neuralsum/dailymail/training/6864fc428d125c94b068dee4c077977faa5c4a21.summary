by her own admission @entity0 has always been attracted to unassuming types			1
@entity4 stars who have asked her out have been dismissed in her withering estimation as ‘ difficult and really superficial ’			1
much like her @entity6 alter ego , the imperious @entity8 , she seems to have little time for conceit			1
so there may be some surprise at her current suitor — @entity14 , a hunky 21 - year - old star of @entity16 ’s rugby team , who has a reputation as something of a lothario			1
pictured in the @entity21 this week naked in a bath clutching a @entity24 trophy , he seems an unlikely match for the elegant and refined @entity26 , who has previously been open about her desire for a quiet life away from the hubbub of the red carpet			1
@entity0 's current suitor @entity14 , 21 , has a reputation as something of a @entity20 the couple are holidaying at a five - star resort in the @entity36 , and have been very affectionate with each other as they relax on the beach			1
so how has @entity14 won @entity0 over ? ‘ once you know his back story their relationship makes a lot more sense , ’ a friend of @entity0 ’s told me this week			1
‘ @entity14 ’s not the least bit fazed by her celebrity because that world ’s pretty normal for him			1
‘ the fact is he ’s come through so much in his life already			1
his head wo n’t be turned by a famous face , whether it ’s @entity0 ’s or anyone else ’s for that matter			1
‘ he ’s seriously clever , extremely self - assured and has no desire to work in showbusiness himself			1
for the first time in her life , @entity0 ’s found a guy who ticks all the boxes			2
he may be the one			2
’ in which case , he will be unlike all his predecessors			2
at 23 , @entity0 has ended every relationship to date because of the demands of combining her studies with a highly successful acting career			2
she has studied at both @entity68 and @entity69 in the @entity70			2
her most recent boyfriend , an @entity70 student called @entity72 who she also met at @entity68 , was discreetly dropped at the end of the summer			2
like another old flame , financier @entity75 , he failed to hold her attention			2
her more exciting boyfriends , actors @entity78 and @entity80 , and rock singer @entity81 , were found lacking in intellectual rigour			2
quite a quandary , yet one which @entity14 seems to have resolved			2
he and @entity0 got together last october after she watched him star for @entity68 ’s rugby team in a game against the @entity88 national side			1
the couple are holidaying at a five - star resort in the @entity36 , and have been very affectionate with each other as they relax on the beach the pair were introduced at a function after the match and hit it off			1
since then he has been spending much of his time at @entity0 ’s house , just outside @entity68 , and took her as his date to the party following his team ’s victory in the @entity95 against @entity104			2
as one fellow student puts it : ‘ to take her as his date means he is serious about her , as you would n’t normally take someone who is just a friend to such an event			1
’ not only is @entity14 a dashing sportsman , he is widely admired as one of the best - looking men at @entity68			1
he is fluent in three languages ( he is reading @entity114 and @entity88 at @entity115 )			2
and he keeps famous company			2
the @entity21 has learned that @entity14 ’s sister , @entity117 , 23 , is in a long - term relationship with @entity119 , one of the founders of rock band @entity121			1
the band ’s lead singer , @entity122 , is married to actress @entity124			2
@entity117 and @entity119 , who live together in @entity125 , are close friends with both @entity124 and @entity127			2
it is a group in which the gifted @entity0 would obviously move with ease			2
there is one obstacle : @entity14 ’s reputation as a ladykiller			1
according to the @entity135 musings of one of his @entity68 rugby pals , an @entity138 named @entity136 , he has a reputation of ‘ getting to know ’ female students			1
mr @entity136 tweeted @entity14 in april 2012 , and said : ‘ rumours flying round the nest ’ that you ‘ got to know a fellow student ’ last night			2
he then posted the rather ungentlemanly tagline ‘ another notch on the bedpost ’			0
@entity0 ’s fans have rallied in response , deluging @entity14 with @entity135 messages warning him not to break her heart			0
yet , contrary to prurient locker - room gossip , friends maintain young @entity154 is anything but a @entity156 say , his ebullient demeanour belies what has been an incredibly challenging childhood			1
‘ @entity14 ’s a remarkable guy all right , but i ’d never describe him as a “ notch on the bedpost ” kind of person , ’ says @entity160 , a friend from his teenage years living in @entity161 , @entity162			1
‘ he was always more interested in his rugby than women			0
not to say he was n’t popular with the girls , it ’s just that he did n’t have that kind of attitude			0
‘ he has n’t been dealt the easiest hand in life , but you would n’t know it if you met him			0
he ’s the kind of bloke who makes his success look more straightforward than it has been			0
but he ’s definitely not the type to sleep around			0
i ’ve never heard anyone talk about him that way			0
he ’s been through so much , there ’s no way he would be so superficial			0
’ to describe @entity14 ’s life story as heartbreaking would not be an exaggeration			0
in fact , it is the stuff of tragic novels			0
raised in the leafy @entity162 borough of @entity191 with his sister , known to the family as @entity194 , two years his senior , his father @entity196 died at the age of 42 from leukaemia in 1995 when @entity14 was still a toddler			0
their mother , @entity201 , a senior lawyer at @entity204 law firm @entity203 , raised them alone			0
inspired by her experiences , she wrote a successful children ’s book aimed at helping parents to explain bereavement to their children which is still in print today			0
pictured naked in a bath clutching a trophy , he seems an unlikely match for elegant and refined @entity26 to describe @entity14 's life story as heartbreaking would not be an exaggeration - it is the stuff of tragic novels somehow she managed to combine a highly successful career ( she became a lecturer at the @entity221 in @entity162 ) with motherhood			1
@entity223 , a friend since they studied together at @entity104 in the early @entity225 , describes her as having a ‘ creative and analytical mind ’ combined with a ‘ natural glamour ’			1
when the children were in their teens , however , she too was diagnosed with breast cancer			0
she died in early 2008 when @entity14 was 16 and before she had even turned 50 , just weeks after taking her children for a last holiday in the @entity36			1
orphaned , @entity14 moved in with family friends to complete his sixth form at £ 18,900 - a - year @entity235 , where he excelled both in the classroom and the sport ’s field			1
he was made the school ’s captain in his final year			0
on leaving school he moved in with his sister to a @entity246 ’s @entity245 terrace house			0
yet the siblings — who are extremely close — have since enjoyed lives which are anything but ordinary			0
@entity14 made a seamless transition to @entity68 , via internships with an investment bank and @entity203 , following a stint coaching youth rugby in @entity255			0
he spent last year in @entity88 , studying in the city of @entity257 , where he played fly half for the semi-professional rugby side			0
his sister , meanwhile , has had a meteoric rise as a fashion designer			0
she studied medicine , but dropped out to pursue her interest in design			0
a spokesman for @entity26 said : ' we do not comment on speculation regarding our clients ' private lives ' she designed costumes for @entity127 in the @entity272 - directed thriller @entity273 : @entity274 , due for release later this year			1
in the background , throughout , was @entity117 ’s relationship with @entity119			0
a fellow @entity235 alumnus , @entity119 , 27 , has been touring the globe for the past five years with @entity121			0
through him , @entity117 and @entity14 have got to know a wide circle of stars			0
last year , @entity117 set up home in @entity283 with @entity119 , where she has launched her own fashion brand and @entity14 enjoys guest - list status at @entity121 gigs			1
having already endured such loss in his life , the rock ’ n ’ roll lifestyle has obviously failed to seduce him			0
his principal outlet is sport			0
at @entity68 he enjoys a certain exclusive status which comes with being a rugby blue			0
‘ they are seen as elite sportsmen who attract good - looking girls , ’ says a contemporary who knows the couple			1
‘ @entity0 and @entity14 move in the same circles , but they are a very private couple			1
they spend a lot of time after the rugby matches at the bar in the @entity307			0
’ how different a scenario from last year , when rumours were rife that she would soon be engaged to @entity70 heir @entity310 , also 23			0
but she quietly dumped him after he became embroiled in a drugs scandal			0
pictures uploaded to a friend ’s facebook page show him at a @entity315 in front of six white scrunched - up paper packets on a table bearing the distinct traces of white powder			1
he denied the packages contained drugs , saying it was scraps of paper and flour from a loaf at a dinner they had just finished			0
a spokesman for @entity26 said : ‘ we do not comment on speculation regarding our clients ’ private lives			1
’ now the girl for whom fame proved so trying seems content with her dashing rugby star whose challenges have been greater than her own			1
perhaps in each other they have finally found the perfect match			1

@entity346 , 21 , has a reputation as something of a lothario and seems an unlikely match for the elegant and refined @entity26
the couple are currently holidaying in a five - star @entity36 resort
a friend of @entity26 said : ' he may be the one '
