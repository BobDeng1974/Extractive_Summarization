by @entity0 published : 08:15 est , 15 february 2013 updated : 11:07 est , 15 february 2013 those wanting a bit of privacy - and the chance to pretend to be a @entity6 villain - can now rent a secluded house perched on top of an island			1
that is , if they have £ 6,000 for a week 's stay			2
the hideaway home which sits atop the 80ft summit of @entity16 is surrounded by water during high tide with the only way to gain access via a private suspension bridge			1
welcome to the island ! lord and @entity24 have sold the property and it is now being offered as a holiday let what a view ! the remarkable dwelling , in @entity29 , @entity30 , has a terrace where holiday makers can enjoy stunning sights from the privacy of their home the home will now be available for nearly £ 6,000 a week - but here is no other place like it in the @entity40 its suspension foot - bridge is the only means of connecting it to the mainland its previous owners , @entity23 and @entity24 , have finally sold up for £ 1million because they were fed up of walking up the slippery granite stairs and endless noisy beach parties in @entity29 , @entity30			1
but a @entity40 holiday firm have now rebranded it ' @entity52 in @entity53 ' and will rent it out this summer - at the steep price of nearly £ 6,000 a week			2
a week 's stay will cost £ 5,575 for a party of six in june , although the unique pad can be had for as little as £ 1,845 for two people later in the year			0
a spokesman for @entity60 insists the steep cliffs ' should be of no concern - indeed that is one of the main attractions of this unique property			0
' marketing manager @entity66 said : ' there is no other beach holiday experience like it available			0
' guests will be able to hoist a flag to let everyone know they are in residence and they have their own suspension bridge gated at the mainland end to ensure complete privacy			2
' the remarkable dwelling , in @entity29 , @entity30 , was built in the 1901 and was once owned by sir @entity79 , inventor of the spark plug			1
and rather fittingly for a pad reminiscent of a super villain 's hideout , @entity82 creator sir @entity81 was once a visitor			0
the previous owners @entity23 and @entity24 sold it last year for a reported £ 1 million after complaining that the steps either side of the swaying 100ft edwardian bridge had become too much			1
they had purchased their retirement home in 2001 , but put it up for sale in 2010			2
the pair had formed an action group to ' smarten up ' the reputation of @entity29 , long regarded as a haven for drunken , raucous parties			1
the three - bedroom home perches on top of a little island that is surrounded by water when the tide is in spacious : guests will be able to hoist a flag to let everyone know they are in residence for decades the house perched 80ft high has been a source of fascination - now visitors can experience island life the tiny home sits in the centre of the sandy beach , and visitors will be able to hear the waves lap the rock they are perched on in the summer of 2003 , @entity24 penned a four - page letter to her local council saying that it had a duty to bring the mayhem on the beach to an end			1
many in the town were appalled by the negative publicity - especially those making money out of the revellers - but others agreed with the @entity133 and formed the @entity134 ( @entity135 ) to get the place cleaned up			0
@entity24 once applied to the @entity137 to have @entity16 officially recognised as the world 's smallest island			0
but officials ruled it does not qualify - because it has less than 50 residents - and said it was technically an outcrop			0
this was the third time the property has been offered for sale in the last 40 years .			0

secluded @entity29 home is surrounded by water when the tide comes in
owners were tired of slippery bridge that is only access to house
