@entity158 is the most common form of blood cancer in children			2
@entity158 is a blood cancer that affects the white blood cells , a really important part of our immune system that fights infection			0
acute lymphoblastic leukaemia ( @entity169 ) and acute myeloid leukaemia ( @entity171 ) are forms of cancer which affect blood - producing cells in the bone marrow			2
when a child has leukaemia , control of blood cell production breaks down			0
the bone marrow - the soft tissue in the middle of our bones where all our blood cells are made - makes lots of abnormal white blood , or leukaemia cells			0
these never mature into proper white blood cells , vital to a healthy immune system , and so children with leukaemia are at more risk of infection			2
now nine in ten children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia ( all ) - a remarkable turnaround for a previously untreatable disease			2
the cure rates for children with acute myeloid leukaemia ( @entity171 ) are now around 65 per cent			2
the photo of @entity7 meeting @entity3 was eventually used inside a presentation package featuring a £ 5 coin to mark the princess 's death			1
