by @entity0 published : 04:46 est , 16 october 2012 updated : 11:10 est , 16 october 2012 a well - organised sham marriage gang staged fake weddings with eastern @entity5 brides so @entity7 men could illegally enter the @entity8 , a court heard			1
@entity10 and @entity11 women living in the @entity8 were paid by @entity14 - based @entity13 organisers to fly out to @entity15 where ' marriages ' were arranged with @entity7 nationals			1
supported by false documents , applications for settlement and family permit visas were submitted to the @entity24 in @entity25 by @entity15 seeking leave to join their ' wives ' in the @entity8 , @entity19 @entity18 was told			1
sham : 18 people face jail as they await the sentencing hearing at @entity32 over their involvement in a sham marriage gang in @entity14 as overseas nationals they would have been allowed to stay in the @entity8 as ' husbands ' of their spouses who were legitimately resident here as @entity41 citizens			1
but suspicions over the growing number of applications in @entity25 led to the ring being smashed and none of the 62 fraudulent visa applications were ever granted			0
prosecutor @entity48 said : ' it was a well - run , professional and indeed commercial operation			1
it was a massive operation over a considerable period of time			0
' the phoney weddings included brides posing for photographs with their ' grooms ' and pretending they were getting married			0
the photos were then submitted in support of visa applications along with false documents claiming the women could support their ' husbands ' in the @entity8			1
one 25 - year - old @entity10 woman claimed to have been married three times in the space of four months and another ' bride ' was found with £ 1,000 in her handbag when she returned to the @entity8			1
eighteen defendants are now facing jail when they are sentenced at a later date			2
in a series of three trials at @entity32 which can only now be reported after restrictions were lifted , seven defendants were found guilty after trials of conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration to the @entity8 between january 1 , 2009 and december 31 , 2011			1
another 11 defendants pleaded guilty to the same charge			2
two of the alleged main organisers are on the run			1
ms @entity48 told the court : ' the aim of the conspiracy was to try and enable the applicants to enter the @entity8 unlawfully			2
' some of those involved were sponsors of the false applications ie the alleged spouse or fiancee of the applicant			0
' although some of the sponsors took part in what appear to be wedding ceremonies with the applicants in @entity15 they clearly had no intention of living with them in settled and genuine relationships			1
' their marriages or pretend marriages posing for photographs and pretending they were marrying were undertaken solely for immigration purposes and were therefore sham marriages			0
' she said some of the ' brides ' never took part in ceremonies but allowed their details to be used , pretending to be the spouse of the applicant			0
' the women were part of the conspiracy because they allowed themselves to be put forward as genuine wives of the applicants when clearly they were not , ' said ms @entity48			2
a total of 62 fraudulent visa applications were linked to 32 addresses in the @entity8 and false documents were traced back to an address in @entity127 , near @entity14 town centre , the semi-detached home at the time of the organisers , brothers @entity133 , 41 , and @entity134 , 27 , @entity135 , 32 , and @entity136 , 21			2
forged documents were also found across the street in a bag in the attic at the home of @entity142 , 59 , and his wife @entity143 , 31			0
@entity143 was cleared of conspiracy			0
