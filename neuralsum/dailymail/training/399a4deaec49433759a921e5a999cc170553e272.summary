a statement from @entity1 said : ' while in @entity13 dr @entity0 and her team delivered first class , first - hand reporting from the front lines of this tragic and monumental story			1
their subsequent departure from @entity44 , their return to the @entity40 and period of quarantine has been a challenging time			2
' we have encouraged them – and they have agreed – to take some time off with their families and friends to help restore some normalcy to their lives			0
we very much look forward to their return next month			0
' the statement added that the network were relieved to say that dr @entity0 and the rest of the crew were ' healthy and symptom - free '			1
@entity0 , a surgeon who spent 17 years reporting for @entity61 before joining @entity1 in 2006 , came under fire for allegedly violating her quarantine and then refusing to explain what happened			1
the confusion sparked a furious response from thousands of viewers writing to the station to say they no longer trust @entity0			1

@entity0 's failure to be more specific about the lapse or take greater responsibility was another flashpoint			0
@entity0 's ' arrogance and dismissiveness ' create a huge pr and credibility problem for @entity1 , said @entity117 , an expert on ethics for the journalism think tank the @entity121			1
