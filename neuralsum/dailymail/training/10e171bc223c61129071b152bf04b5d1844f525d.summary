by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor former high court judge @entity2 today rejected criticism of her appointment to lead an inquiry into claims of an @entity9 cover - up of child sex abuse , despite her brother being in the @entity12 at the time			1
she is to lead a panel of experts investigating allegations that politicians , the police , the judiciary , celebrities , the @entity19 , the @entity20 and the @entity21 conspired to cover - up abuse over several decades			1
but her brother , sir @entity25 , sat in the conservative cabinet as attorney general from 1979 - 87 , the period in which much of the alleged abuse is said to have taken place			1
sir @entity25 was accused of a ' cover - up ' in the early 1980s over a refusal to prosecute @entity42 diplomat sir @entity41 , who was a member of the @entity43			2
sir @entity25 , who died in 1992 , is said to have had a 20 minute argument outside the @entity46 chamber with @entity48 mp @entity47 in the 1980s in an attempt to stop him using parliamentary privilege to name diplomat sir @entity41 as a paedophile			0
today @entity2 brushed off the controversy this morning , telling the @entity19 : ' i know absolutely nothing about it , ' she told the @entity19			1
' if people think i am not suitable , then that 's up to them			0
' @entity42 diplomat sir @entity41 was a member of the @entity43 but was not prosecuted in the 1980s @entity2 has faced calls to step down after reports that sir @entity25 tried to prevent ex-mp @entity47 airing claims about a diplomat in @entity65 in the 1980s			1
@entity67 mp @entity66 , who has led his own inquiry into abuse carried out by former @entity71 mp sir @entity70 , said : ' we want somebody in the chair that exudes confidence and that ’s not the case			1
' she ’s part of the establishment and that raises concerns and the relationship in terms of her brother , i think , is too close for comfort			0
i think that ’s the conclusion most people will reach , ' he told the @entity19			2
mr @entity66 said she should ' consider her position ' , adding : ' i think she should consider her position			0
i find it quite surprising that neither she nor the government realised that her relationship with her brother was connected with @entity47 and all this palaver around it			0
' it beggars belief that that had n’t been considered in the first place			0
' @entity67 mp @entity100 , chairman of the home affairs select committee , also said he was ' surprised that the government has chosen a member of the @entity105 no matter how distinguished to head the inquiry '			1
he added : ' she is a member of @entity65 and is very closely related to a former lord chancellor			0
' conservative @entity109 , who chairs the @entity46 health select committee , said she did not doubt the peer 's integrity but it was ' hard to see why @entity2 would want to accept a role so many regard as conflicted at the outset '			1
@entity118 , head of the abuse team at law firm @entity120 , which represents alleged victims of abuse at institutions that will be examined by the inquiry , said : ' @entity127 is a person of enormous integrity , the concern really is that she is just too close to the establishment and , in particular , concern over her family connection to sir @entity25			2
' justice must be seen to be done by those who are understandably the most reticent to come forward , those who have survived abuse			0
' the panel needs to be reconsidered and must involve those working in the area of child abuse as well as survivors of abuse now working in that area			2
' but the government rallied round @entity2 , a former president of the @entity145 of the @entity145 who chaired the @entity146			2
@entity67 mp @entity66 said @entity2 should consider her position while @entity48 mp @entity109 said her appointment was ' conflicted at the outset ' @entity151 today called for the child sex abuse inquiry to examine links between a civil liberties group she used to work for and the notorious @entity43			1
@entity67 ’s deputy leader worked as legal officer for the @entity157 between 1978 and 1982 , when @entity43 was one of its affiliates			2
ms @entity151 said @entity2 's inquiry should ' obviously ' look into @entity43			1
she told @entity161 : ' the thing about @entity43 , which was so pernicious about it , is that they infiltrated organisations , so they infiltrated social work organisations , they infiltrated even the @entity165 as it turns out , and obviously that is deeply regrettable			0
' what they did is they said they were just for free speech and talking about sexual identity , but actually what they were doing was covering up for their own evil child abuse			0
' so , yes , i 'm sure that the whole issue of @entity43 will be looked at in this inquiry			0
they were a very evil organisation			0
' shown a picture of an advert for the @entity157 in a @entity43 magazine from the 1970s , she said : ' obviously it is very regrettable that they even existed and peddled that line of argument , but worst of all that they were perpetrating abuse			0
' the @entity165 said @entity2 's integrity was ' beyond reproach ' and it stood ' unreservedly ' by her appointment			1
the prime minister also insisted she was the right person to lead the inquiry			2
mr @entity197 's official spokesman told a @entity199 media briefing : ' she commands the very highest respect for her professional expertise and integrity			0
' his view is that she does command widespread respect and confidence , and rightly so			0
' however , mr @entity197 's spokesman declined to say whether @entity2 's relationship to @entity25 had been discussed during the process of picking an inquiry chair			1
' the focus was on finding a person with the right expertise and integrity , ' said the prime minister 's spokesman			0
' that 's exactly what we have in @entity2			1
' asked whether mr @entity197 considered her family relationships relevant to her appointment , the spokesman said : ' there has been no change in the government 's and the prime minister 's view about her suitability for the role			2
' actor @entity229 , sir @entity25 's son and nephew of @entity2 , also defended her appointment			1
he told @entity161 : ' i know my aunt very well , and had she felt any form of bias or idea that she should n't be doing this inquiry , she would have pulled out this morning			0
' the very fact that she has n't means , to me , that she feels absolutely no political ties to my father and knew nothing about what was going on in the @entity243 at that time and therefore she has every right i think to continue to do the inquiry			0
' the @entity165 said @entity2 's integrity was ' beyond reproach ' and it stood ' unreservedly ' by her appointment			1
and in a written statement to mps , mrs may said : ' @entity2 brings with her many years of experience in the field of child protection and law , and i am confident that she will deliver the thorough , robust and independent review that i have promised			2
' to ensure that the terms of reference for the inquiry are sufficient to deliver the robust review which is required , i have asked that @entity2 agree the final terms of reference with the full panel , when appointed			1
' the inquiry will begin its work as soon as possible after the appointment of other members of the panel and i shall provide a further update in due course			1
