by @entity0 with her love of horses and appreciation for tradition , the @entity1 is an unlikely fan of contemporary dance			1
but that did n't stop her from making a visit to the @entity11 's new @entity10 home , although she did seem a little bemused during one of the performances			0
accompanied by the @entity14 , the @entity1 was wreathed in smiles as she made her way into the state - of - the - art premises ahead of the performance and given a tour of the new building by excited staff			1
what 's going on ? the queen is stony - faced as she watches one of the contemporary dancers perform nonplussed : the @entity1 looks less than impressed with the contemporary dance performance resplendent in a bright pink coat which she teamed with a matching dress and hat , the monarch appeared to be on good form as she greeted onlookers			1
despite recent bouts of ill - health , the @entity14 looked in fine fettle and was dapper in a navy suit that complemented the @entity1 's cheerful ensemble			2
once inside , the couple were treated to a performance from some of the dancers currently on the @entity11 's books , although not everything appeared to be to the @entity1 's liking			0
but all that changed when she was introduced to some of the talent at the company , beaming and clearly enjoying the conversation as she greeted dancers who had waited in line to meet her			0
one of the @entity56 's oldest dance outfits , @entity57 was founded in 1926 by @entity59 émigré @entity58 who hoped to pioneer contemporary choreography and support aspiring dancers			0
baffled : the @entity1 looks on while the @entity14 suppresses a smile during the modern dance performance intrigued ? her majesty looks on as some of the dancers at the company go through their routine conversation : the @entity1 seemed to be enjoying her chat with this pair of beaming contemporary dancers inspection : the queen was given a tour of the @entity11 's state - of - the - art new hq on @entity77 's @entity10 offering a combination of classic and modern routines , it is the only @entity56 dance company to tour with an orchestra and is famous for its daring routines set to live music			1
the @entity1 's visit to the contemporary dance company is her second musical engagement this week , with the other being the presentation of the @entity90 during a ceremony at @entity92			2
this year 's winner of the prestigious award was opera star , sir @entity95 , who enjoyed a lengthy career as a baritone , beginning with a 1971 performance at the @entity99 , before a more recent stint as a director			0
sir @entity95 , who is thought to have inspired the musical @entity103 , is the ninth winner of the award , which in previous years , has recognised such luminaries as @entity107 singer @entity106 and soprano dame @entity108			0
all smiles : the @entity1 and the @entity14 seemed to be in fine fettle as they arrived at the @entity113 greeting : the royal couple were greeted by an honour guard as they arrived at the dance company 's hq pleased : the @entity1 left clutching a bouquet filled with pink and red flowers that complemented her ensemble pleased : the @entity1 and @entity14 smiled and waved at well - wishers as they were driven away			1

the @entity1 was opening the new hq of the @entity124
established in 1926 , the outfit specialises in contemporary dance
looked *slightly* baffled during a performance laid on during her visit
wreathed in smiles as she arrived with the @entity14
