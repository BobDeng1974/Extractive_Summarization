[ caption ] @entity2 is heading for a catastrophic decline and could lose 80 % of its users by 2015 , researchers warned today			1
the team from @entity6 claim the social networking site spread ' like an infectious diseases			1
' the predict its ' decline phase ' has already begun - and will be swift			1
by treating @entity2 's rapid adoption like the spread of an infectious disease , researchers at @entity6 have devised a model that predicts @entity2 will lose 80 per cent of its users in the next three years focus groups carried out as part of a recent @entity19 research found why teens are leaving @entity2			1
female ( age 19 ) : ' yeah , that 's why we go on @entity24 and @entity25 [ instead of @entity2 ]			1
my mom does n't have that			0
' female ( age 15 ) : ' if you are on @entity2 , you see a lot of drama			0
' female ( age 14 ) : ' ok , here 's something i want to say			1
i think @entity2 can be fun , but also it 's drama central			2
on @entity2 , people imply things and say things , even just by a like , that they would n't say in real life			0
' male ( age 18 ) : ' it ’s because [ @entity2 ] it 's where people post unnecessary pictures and they say unnecessary things , like saying he has a girlfriend , and a girl will go on and tag him in the picture like , me and him in the sun having fun			2
why would you do that ? ' the researchers first analysed the rise and fall of @entity62 to prove their theory could accurately predict the fall of a social network			1
they then analysed @entity67 searches from @entity2 , and say the results were very similar			0
' extrapolating the best ﬁt model into the future suggests that @entity2 will undergo a rapid decline in the coming years , losing 80 % of its peak user base between 2015 and 2017 , ' they said			2
' the site has ' already reached the peak of its popularity and has entered a decline phase			1
' to explain why social networks are like infectious diseases , the study pointed to similar research done with ideas			2
' ideas , like diseases , have been shown to spread infectiously between people before eventually dying out , and have been successfully described with epidemiological model , ' they say			2
' idea manifesters ultimately lose interest with the idea and no longer manifest the idea , which can be thought of as the gain of “ immunity ” to the idea			2
' researchers from @entity6 used epidemiological models usually used to study disease - and say the ' decline phase ' has already begun			1
search queries for @entity2 and @entity62 : researcher say the decline of @entity2 has already begun - and will happen incredibly quickly , mirroring the death of @entity62 however , the researcher admit their study has not yet been peer - reviewed			1
@entity2 , which currently boasts 874 million users worldwide , would certainly object to being compared to a viral epidemic			2
but the company itself admitted in october to losing teen users			0
over 11m teenagers and college students have left @entity2 since 2011 , an analyst claimed earlier this week			0
@entity114 released a study it says uses data from @entity2 ’s own social advertising platform to come up with the shocking figures			0
experts believe that young people are increasingly abandoning the site to turn to apps such as @entity123 , @entity124 and others			0
the researchers analysed the rise and fall of @entity62 to test their theory , looking at the number of search terms over time for the side to develop their model			1
according to istrategy , @entity2 has 4,292,080 fewer high - school aged users and 6,948,848 college - aged users than it did in 2011			1
late last year @entity2 shares went on a 24 hour rollercoaster after the company 's chief financial officer admitted that teenagers are losing interest in the site			1
shares in the social network soared around 15 per cent to $ 57.98 ( £ 36.16 ) following the site 's latest quarterly earnings announcement , before suddenly failing to $ 47.40			1
the dip was attributed to comments made by @entity2 's chief financial officer @entity148 about a decline in teenagers using the social network site			1
' we did see a decrease in daily users , especially younger teens , ' said @entity148 on a conference call with analysts , although added : ' our best analysis of youth engagement in the @entity159 reveals that usage of @entity2 among @entity159 teens overall was stable			0
' @entity2 did not release official figures about the current number or users who are teenagers or how substantial this drop was			0
another recent study found teenagers are turning away from @entity2 because of oversharing friends and concerns over their parents knowing what they are up to			0
it found they are turning to @entity24 and services like @entity124 in increasing numbers - where they are sharing more personal information about themselves than ever before			0
researchers found a big increase in the number of ' selfies ' being posted , along with information about their school , city and even their mobile phone number			0
teens told researchers there were too many adults on @entity2 and too much sharing of teenage angst and inane details like what a friend ate for dinner			0
' the key is that there are fewer adults , fewer parents and just simply less complexity and less drama , ' said @entity198 of the @entity19 , one of the study 's authors			0
' they still have their @entity2 profiles , but they spend less time on them and move to places like @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity206			0

report says social networking site spread ' like a disease '
claims @entity213 's site is ' already in decline phase '
predicts it could lose the *majority* of its users next year - following the same steep decline as @entity62
