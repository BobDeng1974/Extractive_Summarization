@entity0 is hopeful he is beginning to put his ' horrendous ' year behind him and play himself onto @entity4 's @entity3 team after a strong opening round at the @entity6			1
the @entity7 has toiled through the season with shoulder , back and wrist injuries and , after starting his campaign with three top - 10s on the @entity13 , has only been able to record one more since			1
@entity0 has also not recorded any top - 10s on the @entity15 this season and that has left him on the outside looking in and requiring one of @entity21 's captain 's picks to make it onto the team for @entity24 next month			1
form : @entity0 is four shots off leader @entity26 after his first round at the @entity6 needs to perform : @entity0 will be desperate to play well to force his way into a @entity3 wildcard spot @entity31 : the @entity7 , pictured here after the 2012 win , has won 12 of his 15 previous @entity3 clashes but an opening 67 in @entity35 will have certainly caught the @entity37 's eye , with @entity0 sitting just four shots behind first - round leader @entity26			1
@entity39 will also be hoping for a good week as he too is relying on a wildcard and the 36 - year - old began his tournament with a steady two - under 69			1
@entity21 makes his choices on tuesday with @entity44 still in with a chance of playing his way onto the team , and displacing @entity47 in the process , with a top - two finish at the @entity50			1
in contention : @entity39 is one of the candidates vying with @entity0 for a @entity3 wildcard at @entity24 @entity21 's choices look to come down to three of @entity44 , @entity47 , @entity0 , @entity39 , @entity55 and @entity56			1
but @entity0 , who has won 12 of his 15 previous @entity3 clashes , was a talisman during @entity4 's win at @entity59 in 2012 and finally feels his game , and his fitness , is coming together			1
' i 'm feeling pretty good i just shot four under , ' he told @entity63 4 following his round			0
' i feel my body is holding up well , i feel the work i 've done in the last six weeks has been really really good			0
' i 'm coming into , i would say , a bit of form at the right time to try and press on this week and then have a couple of good weeks to finish and then keep my fingers crossed and see what happens for the @entity3			2
choices : @entity76 captain @entity75 and @entity4 counterpart @entity21 will name wildcards on tuesday ' it 's been a horrendous year for injuries			1
i 've been forced to take time off because i ca n't practise as hard as i 've wanted to			0
' and that 's not good because i like to get out there , i like to have fun on the golf course and i like to work hard and i have n't been able to do that this year until now			0
' i 'm putting the reps in now , i 'm feeling good , the body is feeling a lot better than it was in the middle part of the season and hopefully we can finish the second part of this season real strong			0
' away from the race to @entity24 is the small matter of the second tournament in the @entity96 play - offs , with @entity26 holding a two - shot lead over fellow @entity76 @entity98			2
@entity98 , who is a likely pick for the @entity76 team in @entity101 due to his successful partnership with @entity103 , set the pace amongst the early starters but @entity26 overtook him with a stunning 63			0
early leader : @entity26 has stormed to the top of the @entity6 leaderboard on day one starting on the back nine , the 37 - year - old bogeyed the first but then birdied six of his next eight , including a run of four from 15 to 18 , to turn in 35			2
birdies on two , five and nine followed to send @entity26 to the top of the leaderboard			0
@entity98 's 65 left him on his own in second , one shot clear of fellow @entity76 @entity118 and @entity119 and @entity120 @entity121			0
@entity0 was joined at four under by @entity122 , scot @entity123 and @entity76 @entity124 and @entity125			2
world number one @entity126 was one under after a 70 containing five birdies and four bogeys while @entity96 leader @entity130 struggled to a two - over 73			0
the top 70 in the @entity96 rankings after the @entity6 will advance to next week 's @entity132 , with the overall winner taking home a 10million @entity76 dollar bonus .			0

the @entity7 had a torrid season with shoulder , back and wrist injuries
@entity0 has n't recorded any top - 10s on the @entity15 this campaign
@entity0 will battle *alongside* the likes of @entity39 , @entity55 and @entity56 for one of three wildcards at @entity24
