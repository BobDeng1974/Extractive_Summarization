by @entity1 reporter published : 16:08 est , 11 august 2013 updated : 01:25 est , 12 august 2013 the skies are expected to shimmer with a ' natural firework display ' tonight as a meteor shower crosses into the earth ’s atmosphere , astronomy experts have predicted			0
although the @entity10 meteor shower is an annual event , the @entity8 believes prospects for this year ’s showing are particularly good and could mean up to 60 shooting stars an hour in the @entity15			1
the best display will last from late monday evening through to early tuesday morning			2
wish upon a star : if you 're lucky bright meteors like this one seen during the 2009 @entity10 shower will shoot through the sky leaving visible trails spectacular : the annual meteor shower is a result of material falling from the tail of @entity28 stars gazers will need only their own eyes to enjoy the natural occurrence , which is a result of material falling from the tail of @entity28 , which last passed near the @entity34 in 1992			1
' @entity28 wo n’t be visiting our neck of the woods again until the year 2125 , but every year we get this beautiful reminder as the @entity34 ploughs through the debris it leaves in its orbit ' said professor @entity41 of @entity42			0
' every meteor is a speck of comet dust vaporising as it enters our atmosphere at 36 miles per second			0
what a glorious way to go			0
' @entity48 , commonly known as shooting stars , are the result of small particles entering the @entity34 ’s atmosphere at high speed			1
prime time : this monday night and the early hours of tuesday morning are the peak times to spot a meteor , as the shower crosses into the earth 's atmosphere these heat the air around them , causing the characteristic streak of light seen from the ground			1
they mostly appear as fleeting flashes lasting less than a second , but the brightest ones leave behind trails of vaporised gases and glowing air molecules that may take a few seconds to fade			0
the @entity10 meteor shower is active each year from around mid-july to late - august , but for most of that period only a few meteors an hour will be visible .			2

best time to see the @entity10 meteor shower is from monday night to early tuesday morning
it is an annual event but usually only features one meteor per hour
shooting stars are the result of small particles entering the @entity34 's atmosphere at speed
