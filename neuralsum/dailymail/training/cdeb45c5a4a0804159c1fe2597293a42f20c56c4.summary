by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 17:55 est , 20 august 2013 updated : 09:32 est , 21 august 2013 the @entity3 union has launched a video campaign to teach children how to carry out militant protests - but they do n't want you to see it			1
pupils could be given lessons through watching videos on how to make placards , oppose local businesses and fight plans for privatisation			1
videos have even been produced which encourage children to defy school rules			1
but , despite the videos being freely available online , the production company that helped create them does not want their name published and @entity3 have refused to grant permission for it to be shown on @entity21			1
unite – run by left - wing firebrand @entity32 – has joined forces with the main teaching unions the @entity35 , @entity37 / @entity36 and the @entity38 to get the material into schools			1
five videos teach ‘ strategies for public protest ’ and ‘ how organised protest is an effective way of ensuring change takes place ’			2
the videos show a group of cartoon teenagers protesting against a fictitious company ’s plans to ‘ take over ’ the town of @entity54 – an anagram for ‘ together ’ – and its ‘ big plans to privatise the entire area ’			1
the children are shown campaigning to save a closure - threatened community centre from laughing businessmen			0
protest : children would be taught how to make placards to fight plans for privatisation controversial : five videos teach ' strategies for public protest ' and ' how organised protest is an effective way of ensuring change takes place ' placards : children are shown campaigning to save a community centre from laughing businessmen when they fail , lesson plans prepared by @entity3 urge teachers to think about how they might make protests more threatening			1
children are asked to think of ‘ five things you could do to push the protest further			1
’ they are then urged to make their own placards and ‘ consider emotive language used to write letters of complaint ’			2
unite also recommends that ‘ teachers may wish to create a display of finished protest placards ’			1
incredibly , the union also wants children to undermine the authority of their headteachers			0
staff following @entity3 ’s guidance should ask pupils to ‘ think of anything that is unfair in your school			1
does anyone make the rules to suit themselves ? ’ this video is entitled @entity101 and shows people how to protest against a big company moving in and taking over a community centre one of the videos asks teachers to read out a quotation from @entity108 children are asked to think of ' five things you could do to push the protest further ' unite is run by @entity32 and has joined forces with the main teaching unions to get the material into schools one of the videos asks teachers to read out a quotation from @entity108 – a @entity121 pastor who risked his life opposing @entity123			1
@entity108 is famous for his poem which starts : ‘ first they came for the @entity128 and i did not speak out because i was not a communist ’ and includes the line , ‘ then they came for the trade unionists			0
’ last night head teachers and @entity134 mps described @entity3 ’s plans as ‘ reprehensible			1
’ @entity136 mp said : ‘ this propaganda is almost @entity138			0
it might be acceptable in the schools of @entity141 , but not in @entity142			0
‘ these cack - handed attempts to pedal trade union ideology in schools would be funny if it was n’t so dangerous			0
’ @entity147 , head of @entity148 , said : ‘ if anyone even remotely suggested it where i work they would get short shrift			0
the notion of encouraging children to undermine teachers is reprehensible			2
’ @entity156 , head of @entity157 , a boys grammar school in @entity158 , said he would only consider allowing the subject in lessons if it was balanced			0
‘ if it was part of a lesson about history and the teacher wanted to explore how people used public protest i can see a legitimate angle , ’ he said			0
‘ but they would have to make sure it covered both sides of the argument with respect for authority figures			0
’ @entity176 , spokesman for the @entity177 , denounced the negative depiction of businessmen			0
the videos show a group of cartoon teenagers protesting against a company 's plans to ' take over ' the town and its plans to privatise the entire area pupils could be given lessons on how to make placards , oppose local businesses and fight plans for privatisation he said : ‘ these videos are very disappointing and send completely the wrong message to the next generation			1
frankly , they ’re bizarre			0
’ a government source said : ‘ any teachers allowing these @entity3 materials in the classroom are obliged to present the other side of the argument to ensure balance			2
' schools which allow @entity3 officials indoctrinating young people to go unchallenged could be breaking the law			2
’ a @entity3 spokesman said : ‘ this series of short films helps young people understand that they can be part of something called society			2
' at a time when lots of young people feel forgotten by the government , it is important that they know that they can shape their world , and that there is real strength in coming together			0
' it is utterly ridiculous to think that there is anything sinister in what is a teaching resource , there to be discussed and analysed by young , free thinking people			2
