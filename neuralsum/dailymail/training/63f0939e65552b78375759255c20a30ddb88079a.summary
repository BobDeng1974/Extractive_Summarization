by @entity0 published : 21:03 est , 13 december 2013 updated : 21:04 est , 13 december 2013 @entity1 has hit out at universities who segregate men and women during lectures with radical preachers , warning the practise must not be allowed			1
the prime minister broke his silence on the controversial policy of seating men and women separately during lectures from @entity14 and other ultra-orthodox scholars			1
universities last night caved in after mr @entity1 intervened to warn them it was @entity19 prime minister told @entity20 : ' i ’m absolutely clear that there should not be segregated audiences for visiting speakers to universities in @entity25			1
‘ that is not the right approach			2
the guidance should not say that , universities should not allow this			2
i ’m very clear about this			2
’ anger : protesters hold up placards rejecting ' gender apartheid ' outside the headquarters of @entity37 in @entity38 last night after their guidelines agreed that women and men can be segregated mr @entity1 ’s intervention came after education secretary @entity43 told the @entity44 that he believed universities were guilty of ‘ pandering to extremism ’			1
the prime minister ’s official spokesman said the prime minister also felt ‘ very strongly ’ about segregation : ‘ he does not believe that guest speakers should be allowed to address segregated audiences , so he believes that @entity37 should urgently review its guidance			1
’ he added that with segregation came possible ‘ risks of discrimination ’			2
‘ there is an important principle here around free speech			0
there is a long tradition of that in our educational establishments and he ( the prime minister ) thinks that is a very important tradition			1
’ @entity37 , which represents higher education institutions , buckled under the pressure and last night scrapped its original guidance			1
it also asked for more clarity from the @entity72 [ @entity73 ] over segregation by gender on campus			0
anger : the segregation by sex at university talks by visiting speakers has been called discrimination and those concerned say decision will take @entity25 backwards @entity84 , chief executive of @entity37 , said : ‘ @entity37 agrees entirely with the prime minister that universities should not enforce gender segregation on audiences at the request of guest speakers			1
however , where the gender segregation is voluntary , the law is unclear			0
we are working with our lawyers and the @entity72 to clarify the position			0
’ but @entity72 chief executive @entity96 said it is not ‘ permissible ’ under the law for universities to segregate by gender in academic meetings that were open to the public			0
‘ clearly , a university like any other institution is entitled to provide services and facilities separately by gender where appropriate and lawful - for example , accommodation , sports and targeted welfare provision , ’ said mr @entity96			1
‘ it is also entirely permissible for a university or other organisation to have private members ’ clubs for a single sex			1
‘ universities can also provide facilities for religious meetings and associations based on faith , as in the rest of society			0
equality law permits gender segregation in premises that are permanently or temporarily being used for the purposes of an organised religion where its doctrines require it			0
‘ however , in an academic meeting or in a lecture open to the public it is not , in the @entity135 ’s view , permissible to segregate by gender			0
’ action : @entity138 has banned one @entity14 group after it found one group had demanded gender segregation critics said the confusing guidelines had led to ‘ sexual apartheid ’ and 9000 people have signed a petition condemning separation of the sexes in lecture halls			1
@entity151 business secretary @entity150 said he was ‘ horrified ’ and warned a future @entity153 government would not allow or tolerate segregation in universities			0
mr @entity43 told the @entity44 this week that the guidance should be withdrawn immediately : ‘ we should not pander to extremism			2
speakers who insist on segregating audiences should not be indulged by educators			0
this guidance is wrong and harmful			0
it should be withdrawn immediately			0
’ the argument hinges on a hypothetical case study included in the guidance which was published last month			0
the case study involves an external speaker invited to talk about his orthodox religious faith who subsequently requests segregated seating areas for men and women			1
@entity138 hit the headlines in march after a @entity14 organisation hosted a debate in which the audience was split into male only , female only and mixed seating.and a lecture at @entity179 in april hosted by the university ’s @entity180 also displayed signage indicating where ‘ brothers ’ and ‘ sisters ’ should sit separately			1
research by @entity187 , a group which aims to prevent extremism at universities , said that over the year to march 2013 , 46 events at 21 separate institutions were found to have either explicitly promoted segregation by gender or implied that this would be the case			2
six of these were cancelled before they took place , however , the group said			2
@entity202 @entity180 convert @entity203 was a speaker at the debate at @entity138 , his spokesman said earlier this year that segregation was informal			0

prime minister spoke out after @entity37 caused outrage this week
group says its *132* members can allow men and women to sit apart
protesters say it ' *violates* women *'s* rights ' and takes @entity25 ' backwards '
minority of @entity14 groups have directed men and women to sit separately
