@entity0 this morning launched a furious attack on @entity3 ' bleating ' about poverty after it emerged more than a million people turned to food banks last year			1
the prime minister said @entity8 had left millions of people trapped on welfare in a system which ' punished the poor '			1
he accused @entity13 and @entity14 of having ' some brass neck ' by attacking the @entity16 for failing the poor , adding : ' do n't you dare lecture us on poverty			1
he added : ‘ true compassion is n’t giving people a benefits cheque – it ’s giving them a chance			2
’ he said @entity8 had left a system where a single mum , working 15 hours and earning £ 87 a week , would have actually lost money if she had taken on any more work			2
mr @entity0 said families stuck on benefits were not ‘ playing the system ’ but were ‘ victims of it ’			1
he said they were ‘ victims of a welfare trap laid by @entity8 , paid for by hardworking taxpayers ’			2
the pm added : that destroyed aspiration			0
and it was never meant to be this way			0
welfare was meant to be a safety net – not a web from which no - one could escape			0
‘ so when i hear @entity8 politicians bleating on about the same old @entity16 , not on the side of working people , i just think : some brass neck			1
‘ it was you who trapped the poor on welfare and widened inequality			2
yes , you @entity13 and @entity14 who designed these systems that punished the lowest paid			0
so do n’t you dare lecture us on poverty			0
‘ and know this – the true party of working people in @entity79 today is us , the @entity80			0
’ mr @entity0 accused @entity13 and @entity14 of having ' some brass neck ' by attacking the @entity16 for failing the poor , adding : ' do n't you dare lecture us on poverty			1
' mr @entity0 promised extra free childcare for 600,000 children a year to counter spiralling costs and said the expense of nurseries and childminders has become a major barrier to employment			1
the @entity80 have pledged to reduce tax relief on pension contributions for people earning more than £ 150,000 to fund additional free childcare places			1
‘ for many second earners , work did n’t pay because the cost of childcare was so high			2
so we introduced 15 hours of free childcare a week for three - and four - year - olds and disadvantaged two - year - olds			0
‘ in the next @entity104 we will double that for three - and four - year - olds			0
that ’ s right – 30 hours of free childcare a week – worth £ 5,000 to working families			0
‘ that means over 600,000 extra free childcare places available for families every year – nine million extra hours of childcare a week and parents able to work an extra 78 days a year without any childcare costs – all by 2017			1
’ mr @entity0 also argued ‘ that true compassion is n’t giving people a benefits cheque – it ’s giving them a chance ’			1
the new free childcare will be available where all parents in the household are working at least eight hours a week at the minimum wage			0
the new 30 hours entitlement will cost just under £ 350 million a year .			0
