@entity0 has been handed the names of two more former government ministers accused of sexually abusing children			1
campaigning mp @entity4 said he was approached last week by a victim who claims to have been abused by the politicians – one a peer – in the 1980s and has passed the detailed allegations to detectives			1
the latest phase in his search for the truth about a suspected @entity14 child sex ring came as he called for retired detectives to be granted an unprecedented amnesty from the @entity17 to help lift the lid on alleged vip abusers			1
above , the @entity27 apartment complex where much of the abuse is alleged to have taken place allowing former @entity31 officers who witnessed the alleged events to speak out could be central to bringing prosecutions , said mr @entity4			1
he has now called on home secretary @entity34 to lift @entity17 restrictions			1
the new allegations of child abuse emerged after the @entity39 mp handed a carefully - researched dossier about five paedophile rings to police with the names of 22 mps			1
it includes 13 ex-ministers , at least two of whom are claimed to have gone to ' abuse parties ' held at @entity27 , the luxury riverside estate in @entity50 which has been home to dozens of @entity44			1
however , mr @entity4 said the latest claims , which involve two former politicians who are still alive , are ' entirely separate '			1
' someone has contacted me with some very precise allegations – not just the names but the basis of the allegations – and it is going straight to the police , ' he said			2
he said the key to unlocking the truth behind the saga lies with retired @entity31 detectives who witnessed events and could be ' absolutely critical ' in providing information to an investigation			1
he said ' a number ' of officers have contacted him , including one who has read a 50 - page dossier of evidence amassed by @entity75 mp @entity74 which is now said to be missing			2
he added : ' it is clear there are a lot of people who could provide a lot of information , potentially vital information , to support ongoing criminal investigations			0
' but they are not doing so because of the @entity17			1
they are fearful of not only breaking the law but the potential effect on their pension			0
this is absolutely crucial if we are to get some of these ex-officers coming forward and to get prosecutions of some of the former mps			0
' @entity98 mp @entity97 has handed a dossier of information to @entity0 @entity0 is already investigating sweeping allegations made by one man who claims he suffered systematic and organised abuse over nine years until 1984			1
they want to trace witnesses to corroborate his astonishing claim that three boys were murdered by a sex ring that operated in @entity109 and the @entity110			2
mrs may has already said the @entity17 ' should not get in the way ' of anybody giving evidence to an official inquiry			2
but campaigners say the offer does not go far enough and want a guaranteed amnesty			2
those who sign the @entity17 could face up to 14 years in prison if they breach it by revealing sensitive information , which could include the movements of top politicians			1
one former @entity31 detective , now aged 81 , said he was ' shocked and surprised ' to be contacted out of the blue and warned not to speak out about disgraced @entity126 mp @entity125			2
@entity127 , who claimed to have found files relating to the mp ' deliberately hidden ' in a safe in @entity130 in the early 1970s , said he was told by his ' old hq ' the information was still protected by the @entity17			1
the government is under huge pressure to put its ill - fated child sex abuse inquiry back on track after two panel chairmen stepped down over potential conflicts of interest			0
a meeting involving more than 100 people including alleged victims will be held on january 14			0
the man at the centre of the @entity27 inquiry says he was abused at depraved sex ' parties ' from the age of seven			0
known only by the pseudonym @entity150 , he claims to have witnessed horrific acts at the luxury estate in central @entity109 between 1975 and 1984			0
after being abused by his father , @entity150 says he was handed to a gang of top establishment figures			0
he has described being driven by a chauffeur , along with a terrified 12 - year - old boy , to a luxury townhouse where he watched as a @entity75 mp strangled the other child			0
@entity150 also said he saw a second boy being brutally murdered in front of a @entity75 cabinet minister in 1981			0
a third boy , aged ten or 11 , had died in 1979 after being deliberately run over by a member of the paedophile gang in a ' warning ' to victims not to speak out , he alleges			0
he says he was taken to @entity27 at least ten times for ' abuse parties '			0
he claimed one @entity129 told him to thrash another boy - and ' sexually punished ' him when he refused			0
after receiving counselling he contacted the investigative website @entity173 in may , whose investigators described him as ' intelligent and articulate ' , before going to the police			0

two politicians join 22 others named in allegations of abuse in 1980s
form part of powerful ring of @entity14 paedophiles , it is claimed
mp @entity4 said he was approached by victim who says he was abused
called for retired detectives to be granted amnesty from @entity17
