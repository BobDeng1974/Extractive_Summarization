the @entity1 board say they will fight @entity3 's attempt to force them out of the club using a shareholder vote - but admit they may have to mortgage off @entity7 in the meantime			1
former @entity10 director king has called a general meeting as he starts the process of removing chairman @entity13 , chief executive @entity14 , finance director @entity15 and director @entity16 from their positions of power - replacing them with himself , former blue knight @entity19 and @entity20 , the one - time managing director of @entity22 brewer @entity21			0
but in the first of two 7am statements to the @entity28 , the @entity25 board say they will ask @entity3 to withdraw his bid in order to save the cash - strapped club the expense of hosting the meeting , and if he does not they will recommend the @entity36 - based businessman 's motions are voted down			1
@entity1 chairman @entity13 ( left ) with @entity14 ( right ) the @entity1 board have conceded that @entity7 may have to be mortgaged off @entity3 plans to oust the current @entity1 board by calling a shareholders ' vote if the meeting is to go ahead , it must take place between three and six weeks from friday when the board were informed			1
@entity3 now faces a race against time to build an anti-board coalition with enough shares to win a majority vote but can expect support from the likes of the @entity51 - wealthy fans @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55			1
the two groups own around 34 per cent of the club between them - roughly the same portion as controlled by @entity60 owner @entity59 and the @entity16 brothers			2
off - field politics have prompted numerous protests from @entity1 fans the statement said : ' the company is currently verifying that the notice ( issued by @entity3 ) is properly constituted			1
if valid , the board intends to seek to have such notice withdrawn in order to avoid the cost and disruption of an ad hoc general meeting			2
the @entity75 rules require that all individuals appointed to the board of an @entity75 company are suitable to be a director of a @entity81 public company			2
' if the notice is valid and is not withdrawn , the directors intend to recommend that shareholders vote against the proposed resolutions			2
a circular will be sent to shareholders in accordance with the act , however in the meantime the directors will not be distracted from the more important matter of securing the future of the business			0
a further announcement will be made shortly			0
' in their second statement , the directors conceded they may have to consider using @entity7 as security on a loan - but insisted any decision would not be ' taken lightly '			1
any move to use the stadium or the @entity103 training ground as collateral will prove highly controversial			0
thousands of fans have already protested against that possibility before friday night 's abandoned clash with @entity108 after it was revealed @entity59 was preparing to have his name added to the title deeds of both properties as part of a £ 10million loan arrangement			0
the @entity51 have already announced they will increase their own loan offer of £ 5million - but will not ask for security on the stadium			0
@entity59 ( left ) appointed his associate @entity14 ( right ) as @entity1 chief executive in december the second board statement said : ' the board notes press speculation and shareholder concern in relation to an advanced notice for a charge over @entity7 stadium			1
the company continues to need funding , including urgent short - term financing			0
' over the past few weeks the company has held discussions with a number of parties with a view to finding a stable financial future for the business			0
the discussions , which have been wide ranging , including both stakeholders and third parties , are with a view to achieving the best possible terms for the business			0
without the authority to issue equity on a non pre-emptive basis , the directors can not issue shares in the timeframe required			0
' at the current time the assets ( other than @entity7 ) , cash flow and business of @entity1 does not support a significant financing , on an open market commercial basis , to achieve the goals which the directors have set for the club			1
' accordingly the directors are pursuing bilateral discussions with two parties who are both stakeholders in @entity1			1
these discussions contemplate a significant amount of capital being available to the business on a long - term basis in order to enhance the squad which the directors believe is necessary			0
a consequence of funding to this level is that , in reality , it may be necessary to use @entity7 stadium as security ; such a decision would not be taken lightly			2
' no decision has been taken at the current time while discussions are being finalised in good faith			0
the advance notice does not mean that security will be given , and the directors are adamant that it will not unfairly advantage the party with whom it was agreed			0
the board will conclude a transaction , based on its merits , which it believes is in the best interests of shareholders as a whole in accordance with their fiduciary duty			2
' shareholders arrive at @entity7 in @entity22 , ahead of the 2014 @entity1 agm			1
the @entity1 directors announced earlier this month that they require ' urgent ' funding just to see the club through january , but they were forced to knock back @entity200 financier @entity199 's £ 20million takeover bid after admitting they could not get enough shareholder support to vote it through			1
@entity3 will only have made his move if he is certain he can carry with him at least 51 per cent of the shareholders			1
but even if they do sweep out the existing directors , they could still face problems with @entity59 , who controls the @entity7 retail division at rates highly beneficial to his sports direct empire .			2

the @entity1 board say they will fight @entity3 's attempt to oust them
however , they admit @entity7 may have to be mortgaged off
@entity3 will look to establish an anti-board coalition
he must gain support from shareholders with large stakes in the club
