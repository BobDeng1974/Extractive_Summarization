@entity2 was embroiled in a scandal over expenses last year when it was revealed that she lived not in her constituency of @entity18 , @entity19 , but in a £ 1.8 million home in @entity21			1
but although she chooses not to stay in the town she represents mrs @entity2 ’s son does live there – with the mp ’s mother and within the catchment area of the academically successful @entity26			1
