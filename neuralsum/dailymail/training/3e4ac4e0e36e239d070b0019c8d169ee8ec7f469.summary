@entity2 and crime commissioner @entity3 , who has faced calls from the prime minister to resign from his taxpayer - funded post , has allegedly been targeted after it was revealed that 1,400 children were sexually exploited over a 16 - year period in the town			1
it follows accusations he and several other senior officials failed to protect the victims from the systemic abuse			0
mr @entity3 , who was the councillor responsible for children 's services in @entity8 between 2005 and 2010 , said the revelations were a ' huge surprise ' to him			1
but it was revealed last week that in his post as cabinet member for children ’s services in @entity8 , he must have been aware social services were dealing with hundreds of children at risk of sexual exploitation and abuse			2
as a result , senior politicians including @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45 have said the crime tsar should step down			2
however he is still clinging onto his taxpayer - funded job , despite a vote of no confidence by @entity51 last week and protesters turning up at his office daily			0
@entity2 confirmed it has reviewed the safety of several people since the report 's publication to ensure ' proportionate safety measures ' are in place - but the force refused to confirm whether protection has been stepped up around mr @entity3			1
in a statement , the crime commissioner 's office said : ' we welcome feedback from all citizens and we strongly advocate the right of the public to participate in democracy through legitimate means , such as peaceful public protest			0
there is however a line in law that can not not be crossed			0
' where threats are made to any individual , the individual has a right to protection and the level of protection provided in such cases is a matter for operational policing			0
' a @entity2 statement said : ' the publication of the independent inquiry into child sexual exploitation in @entity8 has led to a number of people wishing to express views against those featured in the report			2
' @entity2 has carried out risk assessments for a number of people and locations and our aim is to ensure proportionate safety measures are in place			2
' we will respond to any specific incidents appropriately , balanced against the right to peaceful protest and in line with legislation			0
' @entity44 is one of the many senior politicians who have called for mr @entity3 to step down after the scale of abuse in the @entity114 town was unveiled mr @entity3 's deputy @entity115 had been under little public pressure to go			1
however , the mother - of - three decided she could no longer carry on amid the outrage over mr @entity3 ’s defiant stand			1
when she stepped down , she said : ‘ it is vital for people to have confidence in the office of police and crime commissioner and , with this in mind , i believe it would have been the right thing for @entity3 to resign			2
one @entity8 victim , who was abused at 14 by an older man , told the @entity131 that mr @entity3 ‘ should be ashamed of himself ’			1
@entity133 , now 29 , said : ‘ the more he holds on to his job , the harder it will be for victims to move forward			0
he needs to accept his part in it and quit			0
’ mr @entity3 , who was a member of the @entity139 until he quit on wednesday and has met @entity44 , can not be sacked by the police or by politicians because he was elected by the public in 2012			1
last week , @entity51 passed a unanimous vote of no confidence in mr @entity3 after @entity139 members joined a @entity147 call for him to go			2
mr @entity3 was @entity139 's candidate for @entity148 , but the party have retracted their support for him in the wake of the scandal			1
when @entity139 threatened to throw him out following the publication of the report , mr @entity3 reacted by resigning from the party			1
mr @entity3 issued a statement before last week 's @entity158 vote , which said : ' the findings of prof @entity161 's report are not about one person or one organisation			1
' these findings are about taking a multi-agency approach to dealing with bringing the perpetrators of these heinous crimes to justice			0
' i 've had many messages of support , many of which are from partners , encouraging me to remain and to continue my work on prioritising and tackling the extremely important issue of child sexual exploitation ( @entity178 )			0
i 'm sure that all partners involved in tackling this issue will work with me to do just that for the sake of past victims and for the sake of safeguarding potential future victims			0
' @entity114 police have ' reviewed the safety of several people ' in the wake of the damning report which revealed the scale of abuse			1
last week members of the @entity194 held a demonstration outside the police station			0
