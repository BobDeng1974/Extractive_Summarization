it has earned a reputation as @entity3 's most debauched student pub crawl - and this year 's @entity5 event in @entity6 certainly lived up to its notoriety			2
the theme for this year 's night of revelry was ' pimps and @entity11 ' , and saw the university 's undergraduate girls take to the streets dressed in little more than their underwear , covered by the official pub crawl t - shirt			1
hundreds of first - year students turned out in @entity19 to participate in the first such event of the year and were captured on camera unashamedly stumbling around , and behaving drunk and disorderly			1
and as the evening drew to a close couples perhaps unknown to each other hours earlier were seen in passionate clinches , while in shop doorways some students could be seen slumped in a drunken stupor			2
scantily clad : hundreds of students take part in the first carnage bar crawl of the year in @entity6 after party : two blonde females sit down on the floor to enjoy their takeaway food sleepy : one student ca n't wait to get home and so decides to have a nap on the floor ' pimps and @entity11 ' : students adhered to the fancy dress theme accordingly wearing little other than bras and mini skirts the @entity5 organisers have repeatedly come under fire for hosting the events , which promote excessive binge drinking as students are encouraged to go from one bar to the next to consume copious amounts of beverage			1
@entity52 , manager of @entity53 said : ' companies who organise events like this must take their responsibilities seriously			0
too often young people take part , drink far too much and end up in a vulnerable state on the street with society left to pick up the pieces			0
' we know that alcohol is part of many people ’s social lives but we need to learn how to enjoy it sensibly and safely , and events like @entity72 do n’t help			0
' for a young person it may seem like one , fun - filled night out but there can be grave and far reaching consequences because of their excessive drinking			1
' scantily clad female students wore little other than bras and mini skirts with suspenders as they adhered to the fancy dress code of a prostitute			2
male students wore ripped open t - shirts and shorts and were pictured passionately kissing girls nearly bearing all on street corners			1
some students did n't even manage to make it home before slumping on the pavement and falling asleep			2
anger : one girl wearing fish net tights and a black bra tries to get away from police tired : this student looks like he has finished for the night as he sits down to text on his mobile phone embrace : a student wraps his arms around a female on the notorious student night a young female looks like she might be about to vomit as she is looked after by paramedics the pub crawl on sunday night saw female students also donning basques , fishnet tights and high waisted shorts			1
one snap captures a hysterical shoeless girl struggling with a bouncer as her top is pulled across her body , exposing her bra entirely			0
other pictures show youngsters walking with traffic cones on their heads and others receiving a ticking - off from police			0
students appear to have no quarms sitting on the pavement to eat their takeaway			2
nor do they seem to care being pictured behaving drunk and disorderly			1
carnage @entity5 is staging events in 44 university town and cities over the next two months to welcome this year ’s intake of freshers			0
but the organisers have been criticised in the past for encouraging binge drinking and anti-social behaviour			0
@entity138 , @entity139 vice-president for @entity140 told @entity141 : ' @entity139 has long been critical of organised bar crawls that promote excessive drinking and put the participants ’ health at risk			1
' we have established a successful partnership with @entity149 to promote safer drinking practices amongst young people and will continue to do so			1
' it takes a staggering lack of imagination on behalf of the organisers to assume that students are only interested in getting drunk ; with a little thought they could put on activities that did n’t promote such a lazy stereotype of young people			1
' revealing : wearing a short black skirt and black high waisted shorts , this blonde duo look ready to party wearing short skirts and suspender - like tights , these girls wait at the bus stop for their ride home say cheese : organisers have been criticised in the past for encouraging binge drinking and anti-social behaviour girls showing off their bras under their makeshift t - shirts look slightly lost in 2009 , 19 - year - old student @entity179 desecrated a poppy wreath in @entity181 and was later ordered to carry out 250 hours of community service and pay £ 185 cost after admitting outraging public decency			0
following a carnage event held in 2009 , police said they were looking into the possibility of charging the organisers for the cost of the extra police needed to be drafted in to man the streets			0
police in @entity193 claimed the event cost them thousands of pounds			0
in 2010 a court heard how a carnage pub crawl operator punched unconscious a resident who voiced concerns about noise levels at one of their events			0
@entity203 , 23 , was accused of assaulting 61 - year - old @entity204 during a late night incident in @entity206 , @entity207 , on march 3 last year			0
@entity209 , from alcohol education charity @entity149 , said : ' organising events centred on binge drinking or drinking to get drunk is irresponsible and should not be encouraged			2
' never mind a seat ! these friends decided to eat their takeaway in the middle of the pavement public display : two students wearing @entity72 t - shirts kiss in the street during the @entity223 night having fun ? throughout the night the students go from one bar to the next getting progressively more drunk			1
