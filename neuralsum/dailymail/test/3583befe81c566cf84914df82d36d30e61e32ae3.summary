@entity2 is the world 's happiest nation thanks to healthy gdp figures , strong social bonds and an increasing life expectancy , a new study of global wellbeing has revealed			1
the list is dominated by @entity10 nations , particularly those in @entity12 , and measures a country 's population by factors contributing to its citizens ' contentment , rather than wealth			1
@entity20 are happier now than they were two years ago , the study found , but still ranks in at a relatively lowly 21st place			2
and despite often mocking its northern neighbour as an inferior nation , the @entity23 is a full 10 places below @entity27 , ranking at 10th and fifth respectively			0
unsurprisingly the world 's least happy countries are places ravaged by war and extreme poverty - with @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35 taking their place at the bottom of the 158 - nation strong list			1
celebration : @entity2 is the world 's happiest nation thanks to healthy gdp figures , strong social bonds and an increasing life expectancy , a new study of global wellbeing has revealed spectacular : @entity49 citizens are now so happy that the country jumped from number nine in 2013 to number two this year , thanks in part to their well beautiful scenery ( pictured ) and cultural history the 2015 @entity57 is the third of its kind and is edited by a team of renowned academics and analysts - among them @entity23 economist @entity63 and head of the @entity65 ' ' wellbeing ' programme , @entity68			1
first published in 2012 , the study uses a range of factors to determine how happy a nation is , ranging from purely domestic perspectives - such as gdp and life expectancy figures - to how its citizens view themselves and their country within the world at large			2
@entity86 this year 's study is the first to additionally break the statistics down by age and gender , however , with it possible for readers to find , for example , that a country ranking relatively highly overall , has a hidden population of deeply unhappy young women concerned about equal rights and pay			0
the top 10 on the list is dominated by nations from @entity12 - which are unsurprisingly also among the wealthiest on the planet too			1
equally unsurprising are the countries lower at the bottom of the list - almost all of which are in the midst by bloody civil war , political unrest or crushing poverty			0
one surprising anomaly , however , is @entity111 , which came just below the midway point in the study at number 108 , despite being ravaged by conflict			0
happiness : the top 10 on the list is dominated by nations from @entity12			2
citizens of these countries , such as @entity83 nationals ( pictured ) are unsurprisingly also among the wealthiest on the planet too fierce rivalry : despite often mocking their northern neighbour as an inferior nation , @entity23 nationals ( left ) are a full 10 places below @entity27 ( right ) , ranking at 10th and fifth respectively low ranking : unsurprisingly the world 's least happy countries are places ravaged by war and extreme poverty - with @entity33 ( pictured ) @entity34 and @entity35 taking their place at the bottom of the 158 - nation strong list the idea of assessing nations by the citizens level of happiness , rather than simply by wealth , is something promoted by the @entity141 , who consider it a more accurate representation of the population as a whole			1
while many of the study 's headline findings were relatively predictable , the wellbeing test becomes far more interesting when experts being analysing the biggest rises and falls			0
@entity35 @entity159 , which is crippled by national debt and faces an increasingly uncertain future , is by far the fastest declining nation on the list			0
other @entity10 nations that suffered the worst during the global recession , such as @entity165 and @entity166 , have also plummeted in the happiness stakes			2
recent economic difficulties do not guarantee a country tumbling down the rankings , however			0
both @entity171 and @entity49 suffered financial woes towards the end of the last decade , but the wellbeing of their populations appear to have been more affected by improvements in health and social issues			0
in fact @entity49 citizens are now so happy that the country has jumped from number nine in 2013 to number two , pushing the world 's previously most happy nation , @entity82 , down into third place thanks their country 's perceived level of generosity , as well beautiful scenery and cultural history .			1

list is dominated by @entity10 nations - particularly those in @entity12
@entity2 is now the happiest nation , with @entity49 the most rapid riser
reasons range from strong gdp to beautiful scenery and a *vibrant* culture
@entity20 ranks at a lowly 21 , although @entity204 are happier now than back in 2012
@entity207 's least happy nations are unsurprisingly places ravaged by war and extreme poverty , such as @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35
