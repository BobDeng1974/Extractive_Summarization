by @entity0 at @entity1 , @entity2 these photos show how @entity5 pilots are putting a £ 100million fighter jet through its paces ahead of its first appearance in @entity5 skies this summer			1
the first of the @entity5 's f - 35s – dubbed the @entity12 by maker @entity13 – are at a giant military airfield in @entity2 ’s @entity15 , where pilots are practicing flying them backwards , stopping them in mid-air and reaching top speeds of 1.6 times the speed of sound			1
the @entity21 was invited for an exclusive , behind - the - scenes visit at the @entity23 to find out how the first three @entity5 flyers and their 13 engineers are learning how to operate the @entity12 , which is recognisable by its sharp - angled design and special coating which makes it hard for enemy radars to detect			1
flying into the future : a pilot sits in the cockpit of the new f - 35 combat aircraft at @entity23 in @entity2			1
its first @entity5 appearance is expected this summer futuristic : the model is designed to take - off and land vertically like its predecessor , the harrier jump jet - but can also fly backwards for the first time the @entity43 and manufacturers are negotiating its first @entity5 appearance , where it is set to fly as part of the @entity47 air show in @entity48 and the @entity49 in @entity50			1
although a @entity52 air force base , @entity23 in @entity2 also hosts a detachment of @entity5 servicemen who are learning to fly and maintain the ‘ b ’ version of the @entity12 , 138 of which are destined for the @entity57 and @entity58			1
this model is designed to take off and land vertically , like the harrier jump jet , but can also fly backwards and land on the deck of aircraft carriers , including the two new queen elizabeth class ships being built for @entity5 ’s @entity58			1
it can fly at @entity67 – faster than the speed of sound – and has a range of more than 1,000 miles			0
three of the @entity71 at @entity23 are already on the @entity5 ’s military aircraft register and have to be flown according to @entity5 rules and regulations			1
@entity5 flyers and maintainers from both the @entity57 and @entity58 are already embedded with the @entity77 ’ @entity78 at @entity23			1
facts and figures : the new aircraft has been criticised for its £ 100m per jet cost , but it is also set to be the most advanced ever flown by the @entity57 revving up : the jet in test flights over the @entity52 in 2011			1
it is set to come into service in @entity5 from 2018 and will be first be used by @entity87 - the @entity87 in scenes reminiscent of the 1980s movie @entity89 , @entity58 lieutenant commander @entity90 , 44 , is one of the @entity5 aces putting an f - 35 through its paces			1
the former @entity96 pilot from @entity97 , who has also flown the @entity100 fighter bomber on exchange posting , describes the @entity12 as a ‘ step change ’ from the other aircraft he has piloted			2
it can stop in mid-air and fly backwards at up to 30 knots uses radar - absorbent paint applied with micro-level accuracy using lasers for stealth missions airspeed , heading , altitude and targets are all projected on to the visor of the pilot 's helmet instead of a display in the cockpit ‘ each has been incrementally challenging and capable			1
but the @entity12 flight control system is very good , ’ he said			2
‘ it really does make flying the aeroplane very easy			0
while the @entity96 was very good , it was a stick and rudder aircraft and a lot of time was spent just flying the aeroplane			0
’ when hovering , the @entity128 ’s engine swivels round to direct thrust downwards and a hinged flap on top of the aircraft lifts up , similar doors opening on the underside , to direct the blast from its unique @entity136 lift fan			0
the @entity12 effectively sits on two columns of air as it is suspended like the @entity139 - era @entity96			1
unlike the @entity96 , which needed the pilot to juggle three cockpit controls to keep it steady in the hover , the @entity12 ’s computerised flight controls allow the jet to be manipulated using just the throttle and joystick			1
@entity90 says : ‘ with the @entity12 there ’s more time to operate the mission systems and there is a vast array of capability			2
the stealth capability is the other huge asset			0
’ inside the cockpit is dominated by a giant flat screen that is touch - sensitive , making it intuitive to use for the @entity159 generation of pilots who will eventually go on to fly the aircraft in combat zones around the world			1
many of the functions can also be activated by the pilot ’s voice			0
the @entity12 ’s stealth or ‘ low observable ’ nature comes both from its sharp angled design and the special coatings on its body that help it to almost disappear from enemy radar screens			2
another hi - tech feature is the inclusion of six miniature cameras which look outside the aircraft and can check for threats like enemy missiles			0
feat of engineering : the jet is introduced by defence secretary @entity182 in 2012			0
the @entity57 says it will be by the far the most advanced it has ever flown sunrise on a new era : the jets can take off and land vertically and even fly backwards - but our reporter found a simulator remarkably easy to use night flying : the jet is equipped with advanced cameras which allows it to fly at supersonic speeds and carry out complex missions in total darkness precision : the jet is so well - engineered that it takes away some of the pure joy of flying - or in layman 's terms , flying by the seat of one 's pants the information these cameras gather can be projected inside the visor of the pilot ’s helmet or beamed to other jets in the formation , or commanders on the ground			1
the helmet also allows the pilot to see ‘ through ’ the aircraft ’s structure to the ground below			0
the one downside of all this technology is that pilots joke it removes some of the fun of pure handling skills – in aviation parlance , flying by the seat of your pants			0
thanks to some top flight instruction from @entity13 ’s test pilots i was able to sample the f - 35 simulator for myself at the @entity52 defence giant ’s @entity233 factory			2
anyone used to operating an @entity159 or similar tablet would instantly feel at home in the cockpit			0
the massive touch screen display controls everything from radar and cameras to engine instruments			0
falling to hand are a massive joystick and throttle , each covered in dozens of buttons to handle every aspect of flight , ensuring the pilot barely need move his hands from the controls			0
inside the helmet information on altitude , heading and speed is projected , along with symbols to show enemy aircraft and missiles			0
it really was easy to fly the @entity12 thanks to a single button control which puts it into the classic @entity96 - style hover			1
and flying aerobatics in the stealth fighter felt just like playing a computer game – without the @entity268 forces that pilots in the real jet experience , of course			2
@entity0 group captain @entity272 , a veteran combat pilot who is the @entity5 ’s national deputy in the @entity273 , says : ‘ i would have a large smile on my face to see the @entity12 on the ramp as i walked out to the aircraft			1
it has to instil confidence in the pilot			0
’ he adds : ‘ our f - 35 pilots will be some of our best educated people on the battlefield			2
the future @entity12 pilots will be very much more systems operators and tacticians now , controlling the inflow of information			1
the actual flying is second nature			0
’ on arriving at @entity23 , the @entity5 personnel complete in - depth academic courses and train in simulators before going on to an introductory 10 - hour course to get them used to the @entity12			1
as there is no two - seater jet , unlike previous generations of aircraft , the first time they take off in the aircraft will be the first time they fly it for real			1
they then practice take - offs and landings and flying in formation with other aircraft before moving on to air - to - air fighting and attacking ground targets			0
there is an equally steep learning curve for the engineers and technicians on @entity12			2
sergeant @entity318 , one of the maintainers hand - picked to be the first to go through f - 35 training , explains the stealth aircraft has some unique challenges for his people , who must maintain its complex systems			2
@entity318 , who joined the @entity57 in 1991 , says : ‘ we have special shoes to walk on the aircraft so we do n’t damage the surface			2
the stuff behind the panels is easier to work on thanks to computerisation , but it is harder to access			0
it ’s not that different to a fourth generation jet like the @entity338			0
in some ways the electronic testing takes the fun out of it			0
’ one of the biggest differences between @entity12 and previous fighters is the sheer scale of the computer programming involved			0
some eight million lines of computer coding is involved and much of the aircraft ’s capabilities depend on this technology being completed on time and working			0
‘ it is a challenging aspect of the programme , ’ says @entity13 ’s @entity353			0
the aircraft ’s software will be continually updated during its 50 - plus year lifespan			0
once the development work is completed @entity5 could buy fewer than the 138 aircraft it originally signed up for			2
with a price tag of up to £ 100m per jet , the @entity12 has attracted some controversy at a time of widespread cuts in defence spending			1
but the @entity57 and @entity58 are adamant it will be a game - changing aeroplane that will increase @entity5 forces ’ capabilities on the future battlefield			1
the @entity57 ’s famous @entity87 – the @entity87 – will be the first @entity5 unit to get the @entity12 and will be based at @entity373 in @entity374 from 2018			1
the squadron was temporarily stood down at the end of march when its tornado bombers were retired			0
testing : an f - 35 aboard a @entity52 aircraft carrier last summer			0
combat pilot @entity272 said it will be controlled by ' some of the most educated people on the battlefield ' take - off : an @entity12 performs a short take - off and vertical landing operation aboard a @entity52 aircraft carrier			2
@entity5 pilots are learning how to fly the jets in @entity2 stealth : with a coating of radar - absorbent paint composites , the jet will be used to carry out stealth missions and reconnaissance			1

@entity5 servicemen are learning to fly and maintain the @entity12 - dubbed @entity12 - at @entity23 in @entity2
plane 's *premiere* *due* at @entity47 , @entity48 , and @entity49 in @entity50
@entity57 and @entity58 will be using 138 of the planes , which cost up to £ 100million each , starting in 2018
@entity401 will replace the *iconic* harrier jump jet , and not only does it take off vertically - it can also fly backwards
the first pilots to use them in full service will be the famous @entity87 , formed for the @entity87 raids in @entity407
