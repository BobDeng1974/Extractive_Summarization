by @entity0 the governor of the @entity2 has advised a businessman who was refused a loan to try borrowing from a @entity7 bank instead			1
@entity8 was so ' incensed ' when the @entity9 refused to lend him £ 10,000 for a new transit van for his successful business he wrote to sir @entity12 to demand an explanation			1
in an apparent acknowledgement of the failure of @entity18 banks to lend to small businesses , sir @entity12 suggested mr @entity8 approach the @entity20			1
@entity8 said it was a ' damning indictment ' of the state of @entity18 banks in the @entity18 sir @entity12 , who wrote and signed the letter , pictured , suggested mr @entity8 try @entity7 bank @entity20 as he had been refused by the @entity9 , which is part - owned by the taxpayer mr @entity8 , who was refused a £ 10,000 loan , praised sir @entity12 for his response sir @entity12 , who is being replaced by @entity28 @entity27 in july , said he understood ' how maddening ' such decisions are			1
in the letter , he wrote : ' i was sorry to read of the difficulty you have had in trying to replace your transit van			1
' i can fully understand how maddening that , and the behaviour you describe from the banks you have spoken to , must have been			0
' latest figures show that lending to businesses has continued to fall			0
data from the @entity2 shows that lending to businesses and individuals in the final quarter of last year dropped by £ 2.4billion			2
mr @entity8 ’s firm , which supplies air compressors across the world , has been in profit for the last 15 years and has customers as far afield as the @entity51 and @entity52			1
@entity9 refused mr @entity8 a loan arguing his business did not have sufficient ' fixed assets ' - items that can be sold if a loan goes wrong - to act as security			1
mr @entity8 , 65 , who runs air compressor export firm @entity59 in @entity60 , @entity61 , said he was shocked that sir @entity12 had responded to his letter personally			1
the father - of - two said : ' sir @entity12 ’s letter was absolutely delightful			1
' he was obviously quite cross that the banks were not lending money to profitable businesses			0
sir @entity12 , who is leaving his role as @entity69 , pictured , in july , said the government could ask publically - owned banks ' to lend more ' to businesses ' i have to say his response for me to try a @entity7 bank was quite staggering and a damning indictment of the way @entity18 banks deal with businesses in this country			1
' in many ways , i do think , well good on him because he was being totally honest and bully for him			0
' mr @entity8 was especially angry with the @entity9 because instead of being granted the loan , he was offered a free ' counselling ' service and the use of a free business mentor to help him grow his business			1
he said : ' i thought that was sweet and patronising			0
to offer counselling to someone who has been in business for this long , and at my age			0
' the @entity9 , which is part owned by the taxpayer , said he did not have the assets to secure the loan a bank spokesman said : ' on a case by case basis , there can be circumstances when we ask for security for a loan through a personal guarantee and we do our best to make this clear to our customers			2
' the @entity107 reported a fall of nearly £ 300million in lending to four million small and medium - sized businesses at the end of last year			2
two government - backed schemes , @entity112 and @entity113 ( @entity114 ) have apparently had little effect on business lending so far			0
mr @entity8 remarked : ' @entity112 was supposed to be a magician , but there ’s certainly no magic about what the banks have been doing			1
' there will come a point when we do n’t need the banks			0
and sayonara to the banks			0
' @entity8 did not take sir @entity12 ’s advice and is now looking into buying the van from his own funds			1
the @entity2 has confirmed the letter sir @entity12 wrote to @entity8 was genuine			1
a spokeswoman said : ' we can not comment on the contents of the letter , it was a private letter sent by sir @entity12 to mr @entity8 which has somehow found its way into the public domain			1
' i would draw your attention to the fact that sir @entity12 was suggesting other lenders to mr @entity8 when he gave the name of the @entity7 bank , it was not a recommendation			1
' the letter , pictured , from sir @entity12 has been confirmed as genuine by the @entity2 dear mr @entity8			1
thank you for your letter of 9 january			0
i appreciate you taking the time to outline your recent experience			0
i was sorry to read of the difficulty you have had in trying to replace your transit van			2
i can fully understand how maddening that , and the behaviour you describe from the banks you have spoken to , must have been			0
your experience is common to that of many of the companies across the @entity18 that i have visited recently			0
accessing credit appears to have been most testing for @entity164 ( @entity164 ) , for which bank lending is a particularly important source of finance			2
unlike @entity164 , large companies can generally resort to alternative sources of funding , for example by going directly to the main capital markets - which can act as a ‘ safety valve ’ when bank lending is impaired			2
there are a number of policies that could help			0
the government could ask the publicly - owned banks to lend more to @entity164 or guarantee bank lending to @entity164 , or encourage new banks , that have more capacity to meet the borrowing needs of @entity164 , to enter the market			2
the @entity2 can not take decisions such as these - which sectors should receive credit and on what terms , are political and rightly for elected officials			0
nevertheless , i hope that our @entity193 , which is providing funding to banks at rates linked to their performance in sustaining or expanding their lending to the @entity18 non-financial sector , might provide some relief to all types of borrowers , including @entity164			0
more generally , i would encourage people who have had problems with their bank to try new lenders			0
one such example is @entity210 , a long - established , but relatively new to the @entity18 , @entity7 bank , which has grown rapidly in the past few years			2
” yours sincerely , @entity12 .			0
