the editor of @entity2 magazine has predicted that @entity3 will be running for president in 2016 , making him one of the boldest names to do so			1
with sky - high approval numbers and an empty schedule as soon as she steps down from her position as secretary of state , the guessing game about @entity13 's next move is anything but new			1
@entity2 editor @entity15 wrote a piece for the magazine 's website explaining that he became certain of her future run after attending a conference about the constantly - evolving political landscape of @entity23			1
he explains that the tipping point was when organizers of the @entity39 used an extremely positive video to introduce the secretary before she spoke at the conference last week			2
' the film was like an international endorsement four years in advance of the @entity47 caucus and the @entity49 primary , ' @entity15 wrote			2
the six - minute film featured an all - star line up of current and former politicians from both sides of the aisle and @entity55			2
internationally , former prime minister @entity56 sang her praises as did the foreign defense minister of @entity61 @entity60			2
given that the conference was focused on @entity23 , it comes as little surprise that sitting president @entity65 and prime minister @entity66 spoke , as did defense minister @entity67 and former opposition party leader @entity68			2
positive message : the six - minute video featured praise from a host of international and domestic leaders domestically , she was touted by @entity77 senator @entity76 and former secretary of state @entity78 , who served under @entity13 during his presidency			1
as if to drive the point home for any viewers who missed the point of all of this praise , the video concluded with two very clear allusions to a @entity13 run			1
' as someone who knows a thing or two about political comebacks , i can tell you i do n't think we 've heard the last of @entity3 , ' @entity66 said , smiling at the camera			0
' i just have an instinct that the best is yet to come , ' @entity56 says as a concluding remark for the video			0
deflection : @entity13 joked that she could watch the video again to simply ' count the hairstyles ' as the screen darkened , a conference organizer told the clapping audience to hold on as there was another video tribute to come			1
president @entity107 then appeared on screen to praise his ' partner ' and ' friend ' for all of her hard work			0
and he continued to do so for two long minutes			0
@entity13 graciously laughed the video off , saying that she needed to sit down before beginning her talk because she was so overwhelmed			1
' i prepared some remarks for tonight , but then i thought maybe we could just watch that video a few more times			0
and then the next time , i could count the hairstyles , which is one of my favorite pastimes , ' she said , recycling a joke she has used before a number of times			0
send off : the video was followed by a second one made of president @entity107 praising his ' friend ' @entity3 the rest of the conference continued as scheduled , the video showed that many in the international community will volunteer to stump for - if not quite make the @entity13 2016 buttons - @entity3 if she chooses to run again			1
pundits on @entity136 said that the video could cause problems for the presumptive candidate , however , as she may feel that she is entitled to the nomination and cast her net too late in the game			0
looking back on the 2008 race , a similar fault occurred when the household @entity13 name was trumped by a newcomer named @entity107			1
in a @entity150 article today , it was also revealed that mayor @entity151 secretly pitched the idea that @entity13 turn her attention from the grand scale to the hyper - local : he suggested that she run for his job after he leaves office next year			1
the mayor , not minding that she resides in none of the five boroughs , ' told her it was a great job and one the one - time presidential contender should seriously consider , ' according to the @entity165			1
he is not fond of anyone currently running , they add			0
for now , none of those options seem entirely appealing to mrs @entity3 right now			0
' i have ruled ( a presidential race in 2016 ) out , ' she told @entity173 recently			0
' it 's important for me to step off this incredibly high wire i 've been on , to take stock of the rest of my life			0
' watch the video here			0

mayor @entity151 suggested @entity13 follow him when he leaves next year
