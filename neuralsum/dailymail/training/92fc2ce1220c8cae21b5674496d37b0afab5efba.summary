by @entity0 published : 17:53 est , 1 march 2013 updated : 14:08 est , 4 march 2013 a house in @entity3 , @entity1 may not have the airs and graces of a @entity7 mansion in the desirable @entity9 district in @entity10			1
but when 20 terraced homes were put up for sale at just £ 1 the council was sure they would generate a little bit on interest			1
instead they have been inundated by a deluge of applicants with more than 100 people fighting for every house			1
homes in @entity22 , @entity3 , @entity1 which are up for sale at £ 1 each and have prompted a boom in buyers despite the fact many have no roofs and others are so derelict they are close to falling down , the clamour to secure a property has been deafening			1
cllr @entity32 , cabinet member for housing , said : ‘ we ’ve been absolutely swamped with calls , so we have decided to extend the deadline to make sure that everyone who is interested has the opportunity to apply			0
‘ we must never underestimate the importance of having a home			0
for most of us , nothing is more important			0
' that ’s why we ’re working so hard on schemes like this to bring our empty properties back into use			0
we ’ve been really pleased with the response to these plans			0
’ the scheme is the brainchild of council bosses desperate to kickstart regeneration in one the most impoverished areas of the city			1
the pioneering £ 1 sale of the houses was drawn up after a series of failed plans to regenerate several destitute areas of the city as part of the initial pilot scheme , 20 houses are being offered for sale to buyers who can demonstrate they have the skills to renovate the properties			2
damp and decaying , some have lost their roofs and will need major structural work to turn them back into homes once again			0
most of the properties are two bedroom @entity77 terraces with a bathroom and back yard which were built at the turn of the last century			1
many of the two bedroom @entity77 terraces have been empty for more than a decade and are boarded up with unsightly metal grilles over the doors and chipboard on the windows			1
applicants will have to put forward a plan for the renovation of their house and then sign a legally - binding contract to ensure the work is carried out			2
if the new owner then fails to keep their part of the contract they will then forfeit the property and their £ 1 and the house will be put up for sale again			2
most of the properties are two bedroom @entity77 terraces with a bathroom and back yard owners would be required to live in the property for five years and they would be not be allowed to sub-let the properties in that time			1
but , even with the conditions attached , the demand is such that it is understood city bosses may look at extending the number made available			0
the pioneering £ 1 sale of the houses , which is not open to private landlords , was drawn up after a series failed plans to regenerate several destitute areas of the city			2
the latest move came after a contract offer made to developer @entity1 to deliver housing regeneration in the three areas was withdrawn last year			1
initially only 20 houses in @entity124 , @entity3 and @entity125 have been handpicked for the pilot scheme but more could become available			0
a range of initiatives in the three areas aims to bring 179 homes back into use over the next three years with house associations refurbishing some of these properties to a high standard and then offering them for sale at 25 per cent less than market value			1
@entity137 proud @entity136 , 64 , has lived in her well - kept home on @entity22 for 12 years , renting from a private landlord			0
she is one of just a handful of residents left living on the road and said she was excited about the prospect of having new neighbours			0
the retired nursery manager said : ‘ as long as the new people coming in are decent i think it ’s quite exciting			2
we all get along here as there ’s only a few of us left , so i would n’t want people coming in and ruining that			2
‘ it ’s a good move and i would really look forward to getting the boards off the houses and regenerating the street			0
