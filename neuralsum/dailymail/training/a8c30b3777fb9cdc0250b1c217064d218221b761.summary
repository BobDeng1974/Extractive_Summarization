scores of gamers were left unable to play @entity3 gifts or interact online as a result of the disruption			1

@entity75 , @entity76 at @entity77 said : ' we are still at the early stages of the investigation and there is still much work to be done			2

@entity99 @entity98 , @entity100 at the @entity101 added the arrest was ' significant ' in ongoing investigations			0

' neighbours in the quiet residential street expressed their shock at the development which came as a fleet of police cars descended on the area this morning			1

i do n't know him very well - he stayed in his bedroom a lot			0

i 'd see him coming in and out of the house but he did n't really say a word			0
by @entity136 @entity36 is a network of hackers which bears striking similarities to the online anarchist collective @entity140 and is described as ‘ vocal , taunting and bit obnoxious ’			0
the group seeks to cause mayhem online ‘ for a laugh ’ and has called itself the ‘ next generation @entity145 ’ after the children ’s character that hates @entity3 , often using @entity148 to boast of upcoming attacks			1
some reports say it mainly operates from @entity152 but others believe it is more likely to be made up of underground networks of hackers from around the world , communicating using the ‘ dark web ’			0
@entity36 has a history of targeting computer game companies , particularly @entity24			0
in august it sent a bomb threat to @entity24 chief executive @entity162 , the same month in which it attacked @entity5 just to cause ‘ havoc ’			0
