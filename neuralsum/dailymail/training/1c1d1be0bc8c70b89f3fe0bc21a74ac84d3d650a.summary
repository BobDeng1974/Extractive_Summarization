a dying two - year - old 's last @entity1 wish has come true as her community worked together to transform her house into a winter wonderland			1
@entity7 's family wanted to stage an early @entity1 for the toddler , who may not make it to december			1
she was diagnosed with @entity12 and adrenocortical carcinoma in april and despite chemotherapy and multiple surgeries , doctors say she has just a month to live			1
but on thursday , thanks to dozens of volunteers and donations from the community - @entity19 got her dying wish			1
@entity22 , two , got her @entity1 wish as volunteers transformed her house into a wonderland gifts : @entity26 , elves and even @entity28 was on hand to ensure @entity19 's final @entity1 is special she and her parents were picked up by @entity26 in a horse - drawn carriage down the street from their home			1
when it came around the corner , she saw her home transformed			2
part of the wonderland featured a tent with @entity28 , @entity19 's favourite character , and gifts for the toddler			0
her father @entity44 told @entity45 : ' she just wanted to get out and play with everything			1
' and i had to fight it , i was about to cry			0
' volunteers filled the yard with decorations and blanketed the house with lights - which will stay up for the entire holiday season			1
the local fire department and @entity56 spent house making snow that covered the lawn - and despite it taking all day , it was worth it when @entity19 enjoyed a snowball fight with her father			1
@entity64 : volunteers worked all day to put up lights and decorations to fulfil the two - year - old 's dying wish a horse - drawn carriage drove @entity19 and her parents to meet @entity28 , @entity19 's favourite character hugs : the transformation was possible after thousands of dollars were raised in donations a couple of weeks ago , @entity19 's family said her doctor gave her one to three months to live and desperate for her not to miss @entity1 , they said they planned to stage it early			1
the genetic syndrome she has , which affects fewer than 500 people in the world , has created the rare cancer and given her more than 30 tumors on her lungs , one on her adrenal gland , another in her belly and one on her spine			1
despite undergoing intense chemotherapy twice and multiple surgeries , doctors at the hospital in @entity97 , @entity98 , have told her parents , childhood sweethearts @entity44 and @entity103 , that she has between one and three months left			1
' @entity7 is our precious little angel , she is so sweet and deserves a chance to be with us a little longer , ' her mother said			2
tragic : @entity7 , aged two , has been given one month to live after contracting adrenal gland cancer last wish : her parents @entity44 and @entity103 hope to make her last @entity1 the most special diagnosed : this is @entity19 in the early stage of her cancer last spring went she grew three dress sizes in 10 days but mr @entity7 added that it is unlikely she will live out the full three months : ' we want her last @entity1 to be the best and we also want for her funeral service to be very special			1
' mr @entity122 tearful as he told @entity123 : ' she is in a world of pain that i could n't even imagine			0
' it is just getting harder and harder and harder			0
' the couple noticed something was wrong when @entity19 ballooned from aged two clothes to aged five clothes in just 10 days			0
she is now continuing to swell up and is becoming increasingly lethargic			0
in a recent local tv interview , mr @entity7 broke down in tears as he could hear the microphone picking up @entity19 struggling to breathe			2
' it was just too much			0
she finds it so difficult			0
sometimes now she just sleeps for hours at a time			0
' fun : @entity19 loves dressing up but she is finding it harder to breathe and play as her cancer gets worse her mother updated family and friends on their @entity145 page : ' she is so swollen now and her tummy is as hard as a rock			2
but the saddest part is she is struggling to breathe now			0
' i am scared to fall asleep every night because i 'm afraid she will stop breathing in the middle of the night			0
' @entity12 ( @entity12 ) is a disorder that affects a handful of people worldwide			0
it stems from mutations of either the @entity155 gene or @entity157 gene , which normally act as tumor suppressors by controlling the growth and division of cells			0
when mutated , it allows cells to multiply , grow and divide in and out - of - control nature , making sufferers more susceptible to cancer , especially leukaemia , brain and breast cancer			2
in many cases , one of the sufferer 's relatives will have had a cancer that displays similar characteristics			2
@entity19 's @entity12 prompted adrenocortical carcinoma , a rare cancer that forms in the outer layer of tissue of the adrenal gland			1
the gland is a small organ on top of each kidney that makes steroid hormones , adrenaline , and noradrenaline to control heart rate , blood pressure and other body functions			2
the disease , which affects up to just two million people a year , has a five - year survival rate of 20 - 35 per cent			0
symptoms include hair growth , weight gain , a lump in the stomach or back of the head , muscle weakness and high blood pressure			0
fundraising : they have set up a @entity145 site to prepare for the funeral and the family 's early @entity1			1
