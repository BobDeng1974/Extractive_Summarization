controversial plans for a @entity2 drama based on the kidnapping of schoolgirl @entity4 have been put on hold amid fears the show could scupper the corporation 's crucial licence fee negotiations			1
the tv drama , which was set to star @entity12 as @entity14 's mother @entity13 , was due to air towards the end of next year or in early 2016 – when the @entity2 's licence fee renewal will be up for debate with the government			1
however , production has now been halted amid concerns it could provoke public anger and jeopardise the corporation 's deal			2
she was found by police after a £ 3.2million manhunt the tv drama , which was set to star award - winning actress @entity12 ( right ) as @entity14 's mother @entity13 ( pictured left after her daughter 's disappearance in 2008 ) , was due to air late 2015 or in early 2016 the show was set to be based on the kidnapping of @entity14 , who was just nine - years - old when she disappeared from her home in @entity41 , @entity42 , in february 2008			1
her disappearance sparked a £ 3.2million police hunt and her mother appeared before the media pretending to be distraught as hundreds of local people helped in the search			2
however , @entity14 was found 24 days later by police , hidden in a compartment under a divan bed in a flat one mile from where she lived with her mother			0
she had been drugged and tethered under the bed by her mother and accomplice @entity56 , then 40 , as part of a desperate plot to claim £ 50,000 in reward money			1
they had planned to release the schoolgirl at @entity62 , drive around the corner to ' discover her ' then take her to a police station and claim the reward before splitting it 50/50			0
however , the pair 's horrific crime was discovered by police and @entity70 , a mother of seven , and @entity56 were jailed for eight years for kidnapping , false imprisonment and perverting the course of justice			1
@entity70 ( left ) and accomplice @entity56 , then 40 ( right ) , kidnapped @entity14 as part of a desperate plot to claim £ 50,000 in reward money , which they planned to split 50/50			1
they were both jailed for eight years @entity4 lived in @entity41 , @entity42 ( above ) , when she kidnapped her daughter in 2008 they have both since been released from prison after serving half their sentence and @entity13 , 38 , has undergone a drastic change in appearance , by cutting off her long , red hair and losing a considerable amount of weight , as part of attempts to live under a new identity			1
initial plans for the @entity2 drama sparked outcry earlier this year with @entity98 , the @entity98 mp for @entity41 , describing it as ' inappropriate '			1
at the time , he said : ' i do n't think it is a very good topic or use of @entity2 money			0
i do n't see how it is helpful for the victim to have this dragged across the screen for entertainment			0
' and @entity108 of @entity109 said : ' i ca n't see the point of it – the whole community has moved on			0
' plans for the show first emerged in the summer when writer @entity115 suggested award - winning actress @entity12 , who recently appeared in @entity118 drama @entity116 , was set to play the lead role			1
speaking at the @entity120 in august , mr @entity115 said the project would be ' extremely complex ' and said ' it 's very early stages ' before confirming @entity12 's involvement			2
however , the show – which was going to be made for the @entity2 and created by @entity126 , where mr @entity115 is head of factual drama – has now been put on hold ahead of the @entity2 's crucial licence fee negotiations			1
according to the @entity131 , a source said : ' a lot of work had already gone into this drama and if all had gone according to plan it would have been out at the end of next year or early 2016 – but suddenly everything stopped			0
@entity70 , a mother of seven , went on tv pretending to be distraught over the disappearance of her daughter the schoolgirl 's case sparked outpouring from the community which rallied around to help find her ' the explanation was the powers - that - be at the @entity2 said the potential fallout ahead of the charter renewal and licence fee negotiations was too high a price to pay for the drama so it 's been mothballed			1
' however , the @entity2 said it remains committed to the project and confirmed the show had not been dropped , but temporarily put on hold			2
a spokesman said : ' whilst we remain committed to this project , we have decided to pause in order to progress some important production and editorial matters			0
' it is misleading to suggest this is anything other than an editorial decision			0
' it comes amid suggestions the @entity2 's tv licence fee could be scrapped and replaced with subscriptions in the biggest shake - up since the corporation was founded in 1922			1
some members of the @entity173 are understood to believe the compulsory £ 145.50 annual charge for television ownership is increasingly outdated			0
senior industry figures also believe a fundamental rethink is required in a multi-channel age with more and more viewers using computers and mobile phones to watch programmes on internet catch - up services			0
the @entity2 's royal charter , which sets out the corporation 's scope and remit , and funding arrangement – both ten - year agreements – is up for renewal at the end of 2016			2
one possibility suggested to change the way the licence fee is handled is a subscription model , whereby viewers who want @entity2 services purchase a ' bundle ' of channels , or even individual programmes or series			1
subscriptions could replace some or all of the compulsory licence fee – breaking the link between owning a tv set and the licence fee			1
the @entity2 drama has allegedly been shelved amid fears it could spark public outrage at a time when the @entity2 is in negotiations with the government over the future of the corporation 's tv licence fee ( file picture ) an alternative model , being used in @entity217 , @entity218 and the @entity219 , would see a payment for the national broadcaster simply rolled into household taxes			1
like other areas of public spending it would be subject to cuts in times of austerity			0
however , the @entity2 said the licence fee remained the most popular option among viewers			2
a spokesman said : ‘ it ’s vital that programmes like @entity237 , @entity238 , @entity239 , @entity234 and @entity235 can been watched by everyone - not a select few ; and support for the licence fee has actually risen by 22 per cent since 2004 and remains the most popular way of funding the @entity2			2
' the government has already announced a review of whether non-payment of the licence fee should be decriminalised			2
ministers say it can not be right that 200,000 people a year end up in court accused of not buying a tv licence			0
they currently face fines of up to £ 1,000 and a criminal record , with more than 50 a year going to prison			0
one possibility being touted is for new technology to be used to cut off @entity2 channels for those who have not paid			0
however , the @entity2 has previously said it would cost in the region of half a billion pounds to implement			0
decriminalising non-payment for a licence would pave the way for more fundamental reform in the charter review , which will begin in earnest after the election .			0
