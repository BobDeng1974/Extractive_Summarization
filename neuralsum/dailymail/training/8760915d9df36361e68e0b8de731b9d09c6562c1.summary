by @entity0 and @entity1 three @entity2 tortured by the @entity4 colonial authorities during the @entity5 can pursue their claims for compensation against the government			1
the landmark decision to allow the elderly trio to seek damages more than 50 years after the bloody conflict follows an earlier admission by the @entity14 that atrocities had been carried out ‘ at the hands of the colonial administration ’			2
the judgment – which was celebrated by @entity5 veterans in the streets of @entity21 yesterday – opens the door to thousands of claims relating to alleged abuse in @entity2 and other former colonies , which could cost @entity4 millions to resolve			1
the ruling means the case will now go to a full trial , pending an appeal by the @entity14 , which said the judgment had ‘ potentially significant and far - reaching legal implications ’			1
alternatively , the government could opt to settle the claims and pay damages			2
according to their legal team , @entity55 , 84 , @entity29 , 85 , and @entity27 , 73 , were subjected to ‘ appalling abuse ’ , including castration , beatings and sexual assaults			0
yesterday ’s ruling , which came after a three - year legal battle , was hailed as ‘ historic ’ by their lawyers			0
the @entity4 government has responded by expressing its disappointment with the decision , although it stressed that it did ' not dispute that each of the claimants in this case suffered torture and other ill treatment at the hands of the colonial administration			1
' after the news broke today that the claims could proceed to trial , solicitors @entity80 said has warned the government could face potentially thousands of claims from @entity2 who suffered similar torture			1
senior partner @entity80 said : ' this is a historic judgment which will reverberate around the world and will have repercussions for years to come			0
' following this judgment , we can but hope that our government will at last do the honourable thing and sit down and resolve these claims			2
' there will undoubtedly be victims of colonial torture , from @entity95 to the @entity96 , from @entity97 to @entity98 , who will be reading this judgment with great care			0
' the government had sought to have the case dismissed , arguing it could not be held legally responsible for the long - ago abuses and a @entity14 ( @entity14 ) spokesman has stated it would appeal			1
the @entity14 spokesman said : ' the @entity4 government is disappointed with today 's judgment			1
the judgment was not a finding of liability but a procedural decision following a preliminary hearing on limitation , which allows the cases to go to a full trial			0
celebration : @entity2 @entity5 war veterans and their supporters show their joy after the announcement ' the judgment has potentially significant and far - reaching legal implications			1
the normal time limit for bringing a civil action is three to six years			0
in this case , that period has been extended to over 50 years despite the fact that the key decision makers are dead and unable to give their account of what happened			2
' although disappointed with the decision and reiterating the decision to appeal , the spokesman told of the @entity135 's close relationship with @entity2 and its people			1
' since this is an important legal issue , we have taken the decision to appeal			2
in light of the legal proceedings it would not be appropriate for the government to comment any further on the detail of the case			0
law and order : @entity80 predicts the decision will have repercussions around the world for many years to come ' at the same time , we do not dispute that each of the claimants in this case suffered torture and other ill treatment at the hands of the colonial administration			2
' we have always said that we understand the pain and grievance felt by those , on all sides , who were involved in the divisive and bloody events of the emergency period in @entity2 , and it is right that those who feel they have a case are free to take it to the courts			2
' our relationship with @entity2 and its people has moved on since the emergency period			0
we are now partners and the @entity4 is not only one of the largest bilateral donors in @entity2 , but also @entity2 's biggest cumulative investor , and a key partner on security and other issues of benefit to both countries			1
our people - to - people ties are and will remain strong and deep			0
' in his ruling , the judge said there was ' an amply sufficient documentary base ' to test what was known in @entity188 about excessive use of force in the camps throughout the period of the emergency , and what @entity188 's reaction to that knowledge was			0
' on the basis of that material , if necessary supplemented by the witness evidence that is likely still to be available - either in statements or orally in court - i am satisfied that a fair trial of any question of breach of duty in respect of each of the surviving claimants is possible			0
' looking at those claimants ' evidence , i think that it will be quite possible to determine sufficiently clearly where and when they suffered their injuries and the official status of those responsible for inflicting them			0
' it will also be possible , on the documents arranged and collated chronologically , together with the other evidence , to determine whether or not the injuries occurred because of a breach of duty on the part of the @entity4 government			1
' when giving his ruling last year , the judge emphasised that he had not found there was systematic torture in the @entity2 camps nor that , if there was , the @entity135 was liable to detainees , such as the claimants , for what happened			0
