by @entity0 published : 03:15 est , 26 october 2012 updated : 03:18 est , 26 october 2012 @entity1 , previously the governor of @entity2 , has been expelled from government - removing his immunity from prosecution @entity7 's parliament has expelled former senior politician @entity1 - paving the way for the disgraced politician to face trial over allegations he covered up the murder of @entity16 businessman @entity15			1
@entity17 said the @entity18 of the @entity19 , @entity7 's parliament , has ' announced the termination of @entity1 's post ' as the deputy to the parliament			2
the expulsion removes @entity1 's immunity from prosecution as a member of parliament - meaning he may now face trial for conspiring to cover up his wife 's role in the murder of @entity15			1
the announcement comes a fortnight before the @entity34 holds a key congress , which opens on november 8 , that will unveil the country 's new central leadership			0
@entity1 's wife , @entity39 , and his former police chief , @entity40 , have both been jailed over the scandal , which stems from the murder of @entity15 while @entity1 was @entity34 chief of the southwestern city of @entity43			1
the government last month accused @entity1 of corruption and of bending the law to hush up the murder			2
before @entity1 is charged and tried , investigators must first complete an inquiry and indict him , but @entity7 's prosecutors and courts come under party control and are unlikely to challenge the accusations			2
a lawyer for @entity1 , who has been employed by the family to represent him , said on thursday he was unable to say whether the government would allow him to represent @entity57 when the case comes to trial			0
' it 's theatre , ' said @entity62 , a researcher at @entity63 , a @entity64 - based advocacy group , who spoke before @entity1 's expulsion was announced			1
' the judiciary grinds into action only when the outcome has been determined			0
there is no indication we will see a genuine trial because @entity1 knows too much			0
' @entity1 , 63 , was widely seen as pursuing a powerful spot in the new leadership before his career unraveled , after @entity40 fled to a @entity78 consulate for more than 24 hours in february and alleged that @entity1 's wife had poisoned @entity15			1
murdered : @entity15 's body was found in a secluded @entity43 hotel an official account of @entity40 's trial in september said @entity40 fled to the @entity78 consulate in @entity84 , southwest @entity7 , after @entity1 beat him and stripped him of his police job following @entity40 's decision to confront @entity1 with the murder allegations against @entity39			1
@entity1 , a former commerce minister , used his post as @entity34 chief of @entity43 in southwest @entity7 since 2007 to cast the sprawling , haze - covered municipality into a showcase for his mix of populist policies and bold spending plans that won support from leftists yearning for a charismatic leader			0
@entity40 had spearheaded @entity1 's controversial campaign against organised crime , a prominent plank in @entity1 's barely concealed campaign to join the topmost ranks of the @entity34			2
finger pointing : @entity1 has been accused of corruption and bending the law to protect his wife @entity1 was dismissed from his @entity43 post in march , and suspended from the party 's top ranks in april , when his wife @entity39 was named as an official suspect in the murder in november of @entity15 , a long - time friend of the couple who also helped their son @entity114 settle into study in @entity16			1
@entity1 has disappeared from public view since he was dismissed and has not had a chance to respond publicly to the accusations against him			0
the removal of @entity1 has disrupted the @entity34 's usually secretive and carefully choreographed process of settling on a new central leadership			0
sharply dressed and courting publicity , @entity1 stood out in a party of stolid conformists , and he promoted @entity43 as a bold egalitarian alternative to @entity7 's current pattern of growth			0
but @entity1 's promotion of ' red ' culture inspired by @entity132 's era and his campaign - style crackdown on crime prompted fears that he was rekindling some of the arbitrary lawlessness of the @entity137 in the 1960s - a criticism that premier @entity139 spelled out before the public in mid-march .			1
