by @entity0 in a move that would n’t look out of place in an @entity6 movie , a student from @entity2 has fitted a spider - shaped robot with laser beams			1
the remote - controlled @entity10 @entity11 is fitted with a beam so powerful it can pop balloons and make paper and card burst into flames			1
it was created by 20 - year - old @entity18 who demonstrated the full force of his creation on his @entity23 @entity22 channel			0
@entity2 student @entity18 fitted a remote - controlled @entity25 robot with a laser diode that is fired from the spider - shaped drone and is capable of setting fire to paper within seconds , pictured in may , 20 - year - old chemistry student @entity18 created a handheld lightsaber			1
a video of the gadget showed the invention cutting through paper , tape and cardboard - and even melting a ping pong ball			2
the laser used was a 9mm 450nm diode powered by two 18650 @entity42 batteries			0
@entity18 called the lightsaber @entity44			0
to build the device , @entity18 , 20 , modified an @entity25 robot			1
an @entity25 toy traditionally fires foam darts and disks , can walk around , and is designed to battle against other robots			0
by removing the top of the robot and tweaking the firing mechanism , @entity18 was able to replace the foam thrower with a @entity56 blue laser diode			1
by connecting the laser to existing wires , @entity18 was able to move the @entity25 using the robot 's remote control			1
this control can make the @entity25 walk , spin the lasers 360 - degrees , and fire the laser at targets			2
in the video , @entity18 demonstrates the power of the laser by firing it at a series of black balloons that each pop immediately			2
he then fires the laser at a piece of paper , which bursts into flames within three seconds			0
according to @entity18 : ‘ i present my most terrifying laser creation as of yet - the remote controlled death ray drone bot ! to build the device , @entity18 modified an @entity25 robot , pictured			1
the @entity25 traditionally fires foam darts and disks , can walk around and is designed to battle against other robots by connecting the laser to existing wires , @entity18 was able to move and fire this laser using the robot 's remote control , pictured bottom			1
this control can make the @entity25 walk , move the lasers 360 - degrees , and fire the laser at targets ‘ this beast packs a potent @entity56 blue laser that fries anything in it 's path			1
it can walk around and shoot its death ray at the touch of a button			0
’ @entity18 posts videos under the username the @entity99 and has previously created other laser - powered devices			0
for example , in may , the chemistry student from @entity103 created a handheld lightsaber			0
a video , created by @entity18 , showed the invention cutting through paper , tape and cardboard - and even melting a ping pong ball			0
this laser used a 9mm 450nm diode that was powered by two 18650 @entity42 batteries			0
in a @entity22 video , @entity18 demonstrates the power of the @entity56 laser diode by firing it at a series of targets and setting fire to them , pictured			2

the @entity123 was built by @entity2 student @entity124
it is a remote - controlled @entity25 robot fitted with a blue laser
laser is fired from a @entity56 diode and can pop balloons and set fire to paper
