the study found that individuals started to become more aware of their health while in their mid thirties in our teens , twenties and much of our thirties , it seems , many of us think we are indestructible			1
but at 36 , all that changes			2
that is the age , according to a study , that we start to become aware of our mortality and adopt a healthier lifestyle			2
a death in the family , a warning from the doctor or seeing an unflattering photo are the type of events that make people think differently , says a survey by @entity24			1
the study of 2,000 people assessed attitudes to health and found 56 per cent deliberately ignored warnings or indulged in unhealthy lifestyles in a ‘ live for the moment ’ approach - regardless of the long - term impact			1
but the average person can expect a health wake - up call by age 36 , with over a third saying they had a shocking moment which changed their thinking such as seeing a relative fall ill , having a health scare themselves or getting negative comments from a friend			1
the research found that once people start to consider their future health , they take measures like monitoring and improving their diet and reducing their alcohol intake			1
@entity51 , director at @entity24 , said : ' these findings show that by our mid-thirties , health and well - being become a much bigger priority			1
' doing something about it can be daunting prospect , but there ’s lots of support designed to help people lead healthier lives			2
' simple lifestyle changes can make a big difference and reassessing how we live our lives , and the value we place on healthcare , can mean huge long - term benefits			2
' however , the study also found that a free roaming six in ten adopt the ‘ life ’s too short ’ philosophy to justify choices they know have long term health effects like binge drinking or a fat - rich diet			1
the top 10 health wake - up call moments : 1			1
i had a health scare 3			2
a close relative died 4			0
a warning from my doctor 5			1
seeing a shocking photo of myself 6			2
a close relative fell ill 7			0
a tv programme about bad eating habits 8			0
negative comments about my health that hit a nerve 9			0
i had a serious accident 10			0
a public health message worryingly just four in ten thought looking after their long term health was more important than ‘ living for the now			0
’ one in ten describe their current exercise regime as completely non-existent , while a further three in ten claim their only regular exercise comes from their day to day routine			0
the lackadaisical approach of some was also highlighted with one in eight actively choosing to rely on the @entity104 repairing the damage , rather than taking positive steps themselves			0
and one in seven deliberately ignores health warnings on a regular basis to indulge in potentially damaging lifestyle choices			0
when it came to taking action , people were most likely to say that they were n’t exercising enough while fixing their diet and not getting enough sleep were other problem areas			0
the research found that once people start to consider their future health , they take measures like monitoring and improving their diet and reducing their alcohol intake ( file picture ) just 51 per cent would rather take preventive measures and try to avoid ill health or long - term consequences			1
despite rude awakening in their mid-thirties , even those who turned over a new leaf can fall back into old habits			0
@entity51 added : ' once people start to take responsibility for their health it ’s important that they can access healthcare services swiftly and easily			1
' rapid diagnosis and getting issues sorted quickly can help people live longer , healthier lives			0
at @entity24 we offer the best possible service to help people take control of their wellbeing			1
