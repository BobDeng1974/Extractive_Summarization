tiny town : the @entity21 , @entity2 @entity20 failed to notice their 5000lb @entity3 was missing from the parking lot for a week after a man stole it and drove it into a tree war machine : humvees like this one have been distributed to towns all over the @entity32 , including @entity21 , @entity2 , which has a population of fewer than 700 people it was such an unlikely event that the department did n't notice the military armored vehicle - which cost up to $ 350,000 new - was missing from the parking lot for more than a week			1
once @entity5 noticed it was gone , the department swung into action			0
' we just do what police officers do - we find out who done it , ' @entity5 told @entity46			0
' eventually the vehicle in some woods one county over and is now being used for spare parts for the department 's other humvee			2
that a tiny town such as @entity21 ( population 700 ) could possibly need such a vehicle is the basis of criticism of the @entity59 ( @entity60 1033 ) , which gives used military equipment to @entity32 police departments to help fight crime			1
