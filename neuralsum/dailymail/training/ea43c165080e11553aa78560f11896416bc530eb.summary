@entity0 urges caution on ' under - delivering ' @entity2 @entity4 's brazen dictator took time out from orchestrating the brutal crackdown of his own citizens to walk around the battered @entity8 neighbourhood of @entity8			1
@entity2 arrogantly strutted around the ravaged district - the former rebel stronghold which until march 1 was under siege as his troops pounded its civilians almost into oblivion			1
heavily flanked by security , the ruthless regime leader yesterday told the few remaining residents not killed in the month - long bombardment that they would ' return better than before '			2
he said ' normal life ' would soon resume - at the same time as the death toll for the year - long conflict escalated to a staggering 9,000			2
* @entity4 commits to work with @entity47 ' in an inclusive @entity4 - led political process to address the legitimate aspirations and concerns of the @entity4 people ' * @entity4 commits to stop fighting and immediately stop troop movements and use of heavy weapons in populated areas			1
@entity4 should work with @entity47 to end all violence , under @entity58 supervision			1
@entity47 will seek similar commitments from opposition to stop fighting * @entity4 accepts and implements a daily two hour ' humanitarian pause ' to deliver aid and evacuate the injured * @entity4 commits to intensify ' the pace and scale of release of arbitrarily detained persons ' and provide a list of all places where such people are being held * @entity4 commits to ensure freedom of movement throughout the country for journalists ' and a non-discriminatory visa policy for them ' * @entity4 commits to ' respect freedom of association and the right to demonstrate peacefully as legally guaranteed ' these terms have reportedly been accepted by the @entity4 government			1
his audacious walkabout came as @entity47 claimed a major breakthrough in the @entity4 conflict which he hopes will lead to a ceasefire from its brutal government troops			1
the @entity58 ' envoy said he had received regime backing for a six - point plan which will see a daily two - hour halt in fighting to evacuate the injured			1
@entity47 also claimed to have reached an agreement , crucially backed by @entity91 and @entity92 , for @entity4 - led political talks to address the concerns of citizens			1
@entity47 's spokesman said he believes @entity4 's acceptance of the peace plan is an important first step which now needs to be immediately implemented			2
@entity47 , who is also an envoy for the @entity100 , told reporters after meeting with @entity91 premier @entity102 in @entity103 yesterday he had received a ' positive ' response from @entity4 as well as support from @entity91			1
he said he received a similar commitment from @entity92 over the weekend			2
' we 've had very good discussions about the situation in @entity4			2
and they have offered me their full support , ' @entity47 said after the meeting with @entity102			0
@entity102 said work on a solution to the crisis is at a ' critical juncture ' , adding that @entity91 backed @entity47 's mediation efforts			2
the support from @entity91 and @entity92 may have been important in nudging @entity4 on the plan , which has been endorsed by the @entity121 in a non-binding presidential statement			1
agreement : @entity47 ( left ) , the @entity58 envoy to @entity4 , met with @entity91 premier @entity102 ( right ) today - and said he had his support in his six - point plan destruction : heavy shelling by @entity4 government forces has reduced @entity130 to rubble @entity91 and @entity92 have twice vetoed proposed @entity58 sanctions over @entity2 's crackdown on a year long uprising in which more than 9,000 people are believe to have died			1
the two countries called those proposed @entity58 resolutions unbalanced , saying they blamed only the @entity4 government and demanded an end to government attacks , but not ones by the opposition			1
@entity47 views @entity4 's acceptance of the plan ' as an important initial step that could bring an end to the violence and the bloodshed			1
it could also , he believes , provide aid to the suffering , and create an environment conducive to a political dialogue that would fulfil the legitimate aspirations of the @entity4 people			2
under fire : @entity4 rebels take their position behind a sand barrier , in the @entity159 neighbourhood in @entity8 today could it soon be over ? @entity47 has hailed a major breakthrough in talks with @entity4 officials - which could see a ceasefire and ending of awful scenes such as this one in the city of @entity8 @entity47 ' stressed that implementation will be key , not only for the @entity4 people , who are caught in the middle of this tragedy , but also for the region and the international community as a whole '			1
@entity58 human rights chief @entity174 today claimed children were being held in detention , without medical care , in ' horrendous ' tactics by @entity2 's regime			1
she said : ' they 've gone for the children - for whatever purposes - in large numbers			2
hundreds detained and tortured ... it 's just horrendous			0
' children shot in the knees , held together with adults in really inhumane conditions , denied medical treatment for their injuries , either held as hostages or as sources of information			0
' that is the legal situation			0
factually there is enough evidence pointing to the fact many of these acts are committed by the security forces and must have received the approval or the complicity at the highest level			0
' because president @entity2 could simply issue an order to stop the killings and the killings would stop			0
' @entity4 opposition members reacted with scepticism , however			0
@entity211 , who was attending an opposition meeting today in @entity213 , said president @entity2 is trying to stall for time			0
he said : ' the @entity4 government is going to depend on propaganda as it has over the past few months - propaganda of armed terrorists			2
' @entity219 , @entity220 - based member of the opposition @entity221 , said she welcomed the regime 's acceptance of the plan			0
but when asked if she believed the regime would honour the plan , she only said : ' we hope that we can move toward a peace process			0
' @entity229 , of the opposition @entity221 , said : ' we are not sure if it 's political maneuvering or a sincere act			0
we have no trust in the current regime			0
... we have to see that they have stopped killing civilians			0
' and @entity236 secretary of state @entity0 said @entity2 must now act			1
she said : ' given @entity2 's history of overpromising and under - delivering , that commitment must now be matched by immediate action			1
we will judge @entity2 's sincerity and seriousness by what he does , not by what he says			0
' if he is ready to bring this dark chapter in @entity4 's history to a close , he could prove it by immediately ordering regime forces to stop firing and begin withdrawing from populated areas			0
' @entity251 foreign secretary @entity250 said @entity2 's decision was only a first step , saying : ' we will continue to judge the @entity4 regime by its practical actions , not by its often empty words			1
' rubble : the violence in @entity4 could soon come to an end , if the major breakthrough hailed by @entity47 is as crucial as he says a grab taken from a video uploaded to @entity262 yesterday ( see below ) shows smoke billowing from reported shelling by @entity4 government forces on a residential area in the flashpoint central city of @entity8 about 60 countries , including the @entity236 , are to attend a ' @entity270 ' conference in @entity271 on sunday			1
@entity273 spokesman @entity272 said yesterday that @entity91 was invited but would not attend			0
@entity274 and many of its allies have said @entity2 has lost all legitimacy and must step down			0
@entity91 says the crisis needs to be resolved through talks			2
the conference in @entity271 comes as @entity213 edges closer to setting up a buffer zone in @entity4 to protect civilians			0
@entity213 officials have long been hesitant about the idea			0
but they now say a surge of refugees from @entity4 might compel @entity213 , preferably with international backing , to establish a buffer zone on @entity4 soil to guarantee the security of its own southern border as well as the welfare of civilians fleeing violence			1
@entity91 analysts said @entity103 was unlikely to support the buffer zone proposal , especially if the possibility of @entity298 military action against @entity4 is not ruled out			2
' @entity91 will not accept that proposal			0
but it will not openly oppose it either , ' said @entity301 , a @entity302 expert at the @entity303 at @entity304			0
stopped : @entity91 and @entity92 have twice vetoed proposed @entity58 sanctions over @entity2 's crackdown on a year long uprising in which more than 8,000 people are believe to have died protest : an anti-regime activist during as demo in @entity311 earlier this week @entity312 , an expert on @entity314 issues at @entity304 , agreed @entity91 would not back a buffer zone , saying it infringed on @entity4 's sovereignty			1
' a balance must be achieved between promoting the easing of the humanitarian crisis in @entity4 and ensuring @entity4 's sovereignty , ' he said			0
yesterday 's developments came as the country was hit by more bloodshed , with intense clashes between government troops and rebels spilled across the border into @entity327			1
@entity4 troops did not physically cross the border , according to two @entity327 security officials			1
but bullets whizzed across the frontier into a rural , sparsely populated area around the @entity327 village of @entity334			0
a source said : ' there is no @entity4 military presence on the @entity327 side of the border			1
' and this morning three government soldiers were killed in clashes with rebels in @entity8 province			2
the @entity251 - based @entity343 says the clashes broke out when government forces tried to enter the town of @entity347			0
