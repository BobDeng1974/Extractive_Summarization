as @entity1 blunders go it was hardly on the scale of @entity5 's infamous quip that one of his jewellery company 's products was ' c * * * '			0
but @entity11 's decision to extend @entity13 's contract to the end of the season , rather than allowing him to move as planned to sister club @entity16 , left many questioning whether the powers - that - be in @entity20 believed their new @entity22 operation was an inferior product			1
some in the @entity24 , who had already shelled out for season tickets , demanded refunds			0
in the home of @entity30 , others rather dramatically branded it a betrayal			0
@entity13 ( left ) closes down @entity33 during @entity11 's 3 - 0 win over @entity35 @entity13 reacts after he hit the post during his side 's victory over the @entity35 at the @entity39 on saturday it was not , and the reality is that @entity43 legend @entity42 was always a bigger draw in a city with a huge @entity47 population			1
regardless , some may now be questioning the logic of keeping @entity13 in @entity50 , rather than @entity51 , after the media storm the decision triggered			2
since january 1 , when the former @entity55 man was expected to cross the @entity56 , @entity11 have encountered choppy waters			1
knocked out the @entity58 they are now six points behind @entity13 's former club , out of the @entity58 and out of the @entity61			1
not that he can be blamed for that			0
@entity13 has made 30 appearances for @entity11 this season , but many of those have been cameos from the bench at 36 , @entity13 was never intended to be a regular starter , but given the ferocity of the response to his extended stay , @entity11 fans may have expected more			1
@entity73 has given the former @entity75 man just 190 out of 990 @entity77 minutes following the turn of the year			2
in that period he has scored once , in a 3 - 2 victory over @entity80 on @entity81			1
should @entity11 stage a miraculous defence of their title , that may prove key but it is unlikely			2
even with @entity85 absent in @entity86 and his remaining midfielders looking like they were operating on separate continents the @entity89 was reluctant to turn to a man who has won more @entity77 trophies than the club he plays for			0
former @entity43 and @entity93 star @entity42 ( centre ) in action for @entity16 @entity13 , belatedly , did start saturday 's 3 - 0 stroll over @entity35			1
he was steady and kept things ticking over before being substituted with the game long won			0
as @entity73 pointed out after that canter , the season is not over and there are still 24 points to play for as they head into the final furlong			0
however , if the decision to keep @entity13 here is to be justified he must turn more often to his thoroughbred .			0

@entity13 signed for @entity16 before delaying his @entity109 arrival to finish the @entity77 season playing for @entity11
city have been knocked out of the @entity58 and are now six points @entity77 *leaders* @entity55
@entity13 started in @entity11 's recent 3 - 0 victory against @entity35
