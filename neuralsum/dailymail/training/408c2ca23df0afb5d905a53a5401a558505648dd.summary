by @entity0 published : 08:56 est , 30 october 2012 updated : 11:46 est , 30 october 2012 a family who has fostered disabled children for three generations is facing homelessness after they signed up to a @entity6 scheme to renovate their house so they could better care for their wards			1
@entity11 and @entity12 received a £ 75,000 grant from @entity14 to transform their home into a respite centre for severely disabled foster children two years ago			1
but when the builder added a series of unforeseen costs to the bill the council withdrew its support leaving the couple to find the cash for themselves			1
unable to meet the builder 's demands , he took them to court , leaving the @entity32 with a total bill of £ 59,000 , a sum they can only afford by selling their home			1
despair : @entity11 and @entity12 ( pictured with children @entity39 , 10 , and @entity40 , 15 ) received a £ 75,000 grant from @entity14 to transform their home into a respite centre for severely disabled foster children two years ago the couple , who represent the third generation in a 100 - year family tradition of fostering disabled children , have had to sell all their furniture and clothes on ebay to pay solicitor 's fees			1
they say the council has ' left them out in the cold ' over the legal wrangle , leaving them responsible for the debt - which will almost certainly result in them ending up on the streets with their two children , @entity39 , 10 , and @entity40 , 15			2
' i think we 've actually come to terms now with the fact that we are going to lose our house and be on the streets with nothing but we do n't know how we 've ended up in this mess , ' said @entity12 , 39 , from their home , which remains unfinished			2
' all we 've ever wanted to do is help disabled children , it 's something my family - from my parents to my grandparents - have always done and now we ca n't even do that			1
' before : the @entity32 wanted to renovate their home in @entity77 , @entity78 , so they could better care for the three disabled children they already cared for unfinished : when the builder added a series of unforeseen costs to the bill the council withdrew its support leaving the couple to find the cash for themselves			1
with the family unable to pay , the builder left the home unfinished @entity11 , 44 , who quit his job as a bricklayer in order to foster full - time , added : ' i 've been suicidal over all this			1
i 've seriously considered driving my car into a tree as at times it has seemed like the only way out			0
' the @entity32 ' problems began in 2010 when a social worker , admiring their good work in fostering children with profound and challenging disabilities , suggested they could be good candidates for a government - funded scheme designed to create better respite facilities for disabled children			1
the arrangement was that @entity12 and @entity11 , from @entity77 , @entity78 , would provide five years of respite care for disabled children in the area in return for a £ 75,000 extension to their home			1
@entity11 said : ' @entity12 had always fostered children from the age of about 19 and her parents and her grandparents had always done it			2
i just liked it because i got on with the kids and used to mess about with them and have fun			0
history of care : the @entity32 come from a 100 - year family tradition of fostering disabled children ( pictured : @entity12 's grandparents @entity133 and @entity135 with @entity12 's mother @entity136 , centre , and her aunt @entity138 ) happy children : @entity12 's grandmother , @entity141 , left , with a foster child			1
@entity12 's mother @entity136 , also holding a foster child , right , followed in her mother 's footsteps now they have been landed with a bill for around £ 50,000 , plus £ 9,000 in legal fees to the adjudicator			2
in june , they placed their home on the market for £ 250,000 in order to pay the bills but every day the fees are mounting			2
' @entity157 children sometimes get treated like second class citizens , but the one thing we 've always made sure to do is to treat our foster children exactly the same as we treat our own children '			0
' we exclusively fostered disabled children because that 's what @entity12 's family had always done and we felt they were the ones that needed the most help			1
' we had three foster children living with us when we were approached about the short breaks scheme			0
it seemed like a great opportunity because it was a guaranteed job for five years and it meant i could work from home			0
we just jumped at it			0
' under the scheme , called @entity180 ( @entity181 ) , the building work was to include the addition of two extra bedrooms , wheelchair access and a wet room with a hoist for lifting severely disabled youngsters			0
hole in the ground : the builder left the drainage unconnected and @entity11 had to finish much of the work himself @entity192 launched in may 2007 and promised £ 430 - million to local councils for transforming disabled children 's services			1
@entity181 is jointly delivered by the @entity196 and the @entity197			0
however , after the @entity32 ' project was agreed with @entity14 , the builder requested some extra work , totalling about £ 18,000 , be added to the bill			1
these extras were negotiated and agreed by the @entity180 project manager @entity203 , but when the council failed to cough up the cash for the extras , the builder , @entity205 of @entity206 , turned to the @entity32 to stump up the money			2
the family then faced two adjudications , in which the county council funded a barrister to represent them , racking up a legal bill of over £ 13,000			2
but when mr @entity205 initiated a third adjudication , demanding payment for a final account of £ 47,000 , the council withdrew all their legal support			1
one way out ? @entity11 , who quit his job as a bricklayer in order to foster full - time , said he has felt suicidal over the ordeal the second adjudication was won , but the first and third - for which the @entity32 had to shell out £ 12,000 of their own money - were lost			2
now they have been landed with a bill for around £ 50,000 , plus £ 9,000 in legal fees to the adjudicator			0
in june , they placed their home on the market for £ 250,000 in order to pay the bills but every day the fees are mounting			0
the family now face homelessness and bankruptcy and say the council is no longer prepared to offer them any useful solution			0
their only hope is to take the builder to court , at a cost of £ 10,000 , with money borrowed from @entity12 's father , @entity251			1
meanwhile the work on their home has not even been completed meaning there is insufficient wheelchair access , no downstairs wetroom and no hoist			0
as a result , the disabled children the scheme was designed to help are missing out on valuable respite care , say the @entity32			1
@entity11 said : ' we have lost everything and now we feel we have nothing left to lose by speaking out			0
no one wants to listen to us anymore , the council wo n't even return our calls			0
in love : @entity12 's grandparents , @entity133 and @entity270 ' it 's been a horrible strain on the family			2
@entity12 and i have been arguing for the first time ever and our children have been so terrified that the bailiffs are going to come round that we have had to move out			2
' we 've not been able to do the job that we love and we 've lost the three foster children we were caring for because the house is not ready for them to live in			0
' @entity14 has publicly stated that ' the @entity32 are refusing to work with us to resolve the issue ' , however the most recent piece of correspondence , dated september 27 , states the couple has 21 days to respond to an offer - ' a full and final settlement ' of £ 5,000 towards their legal fees - on condition that they sign a confidentiality agreement and drop complaints of bullying they have registered with the council			1
' all we 've ever wanted to do is help disabled children , it 's something my family - from my parents to my grandparents - have always done and now we ca n't even do that ' - @entity12 @entity11 said : ' the offer is a joke			1
it would barely cover half of what we need to take the builder to court and who is to say there wo n't be more problems and more litigation further down the line ? ' councillor @entity315 has been supporting the family through their ordeal			0
he said : ' this family have been to hell and back , all because the county council are refusing to take responsibility for their actions			0
' even now , the family do not know if they are going to lose their home			0
i only hope this awful situation can be resolved as soon as possible			0
' a @entity14 spokesman said : ' from the outset , it 's important to stress that we strongly refute the allegations made by the @entity32 and provide a wealth of support to our foster carers			1
' we have paid in full for the cost of the adaptation , topped up the funding considerably and given the couple money for legal advice			0
' in essence , this is a dispute between the couple and their builders and we have given considerably more money to the family than would have been reasonably expected			0
' like any council , we have to manage public money lawfully and ca n't offer unlimited funding but we sympathise with the couple 's situation and would strongly encourage them to accept our offer of help			2

@entity14 : ' the @entity32 are refusing to work with us '
spokesman : ' we strongly refute all allegations made by the @entity32 *[* *...* *]* this is an issue between them and their builder '
