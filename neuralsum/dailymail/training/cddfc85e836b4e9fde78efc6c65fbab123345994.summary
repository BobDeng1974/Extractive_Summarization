by @entity0 and @entity1 for @entity2 some of us have probably said before that we love chocolate so much we wish we could swim in it , but now there really is the option to bathe in our favourite treat			0
bathroom company @entity10 has teamed up with @entity11 to produce an incredibly ornate - not to mention calorific - bathroom , with bath , sink , toilet and even bidet made entirely from the sweet stuff			1
on sale for £ 80,000 the ' @entity17 ' is made of 50kg of @entity20 chocolate , containing a whopping 9.4 million calories in total - more than a decade 's worth			1
the idea for this chocolate masterpiece came to @entity25 ceo @entity36 after he realised that each year over a million @entity37 misspell ' suite ' as ' sweet ' when hunting for a new bathroom online			1
the cocoa bathroom comes in at 9.4 million calories , equating to more than one decades worth the bath tub alone has 8 million calories and will set you back no less than £ 50,000 sickly suite : the basin comes in at a hefty 210,000 calories and the toilet at a whopping 980,000 the french bathroom accessory , the bidet , is worth a hundred times a woman 's recommended daily allowance of calories ' that simple mistake caught our imagination , what if we created a bathrooms suite , out of something sweet ? ' says @entity36 on the company 's website			1
total bathroom : 9.4 million calories , £ 80,000 @entity66 : 8 million calories , £ 50,000 toilet : 980,000 calories , £ 14,000 basin : 210,000 calories , £ 9,000 bidet : 210,000 calories , £ 7,000 ' when we came across @entity73 , we knew they were the perfect fit			2
renowned for their imaginative and playful design , their creations even featured in @entity80 's @entity79 , so we knew they 'd have no trouble creating a complete , life - sized bathroom suite , out of 100 % chocolate			2
' luckily for us , they accepted challenge ! ' despite it 's jokey beginning and unusual materials , the @entity17 is fully - functional - even down to the 980,000 calorie toilet			0
however , @entity36 warns potential buyers against actually attempting to use it			0
' it will melt if it comes in contact with direct sunlight , radiator heat or hot liquids – so it 's not ideal for running that relaxing bath ! '			0

the @entity100 comprises a chocolate bath , basin , toilet and bidet
made and decorated by @entity25 and @entity11 from 50kg of @entity20 chocolate
idea came from the million *brits* who misspell ' suite ' as ' sweet ' each year while *searching* for bathrooms online
