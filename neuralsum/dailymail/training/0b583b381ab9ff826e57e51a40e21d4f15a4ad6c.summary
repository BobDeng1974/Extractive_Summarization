it might be without a creative director , but iconic @entity3 brand @entity2 does at least have @entity4 on its side			1
the 21 - year - old model , who is currently the face of the label , unveiled her first attempt at fashion design with a bag created exclusively for the brand			1
appearing centre stage on the catwalk in a simple white dress and flanked by a pair of red - haired male models , ms @entity4 was cool and composed as she showed off the fruits of her first foray into design			2
and while she might be famous for her quirky sense of style , it seems @entity4 is no slouch when it comes to creating must - have bags			0
although @entity2 's new bag is available in a limited edition lion design inspired by the model 's tattoo , there were plenty of options for the sartorially shy on offer			1
bag lady : @entity4 stands centre stage with the camouflage haircalf version of @entity2 's brand new @entity4 bag , which was designed by the model herself strutting her stuff : as ever ms @entity40 appeared at home on the catwalk - even when , as on this occasion , her own designs are being revealed for the first time the reveal : @entity4 appears on the catwalk to unveil her new bag which comes in three different sizes and three different materials stylish : the camouflage option is made from @entity51 ( calf skin ) while the other two are made from natural leather or quilted nappa leather @entity55 of the class was the beautiful quilted nappa leather option , available in a range of colours but served up for the show in vibrant grass green			1
the natural leather looked slightly dull , particularly in the small size , but has the potential to look fabulous in a bigger size and more interesting colour			0
the final option was camouflage print in ' haircalf ' - @entity2 speak for calfskin			1
this last is bound to go whizzing off shelves ; an easy way to jazz up your look and a convenient size to boot			0
so what did the model herself have to say ? ' my @entity78 will like this bag , ' she revealed			1
' she â€™s 102 years old			0
' bizarrely , she went on : ' my five - year - old cousin will probably like this bag			1
' if he really does , and great - granny too , then @entity4 really will have earned the right to add ' fashion designer ' to her varied - and ever - lengthening - cv			0
but while the model 's foray into fashion design proved a hit , stylish eyes were also turning towards this afternoon 's schedule , which includes @entity94 , @entity95 and @entity96			1
@entity98 's new wardrobe ? first lady friendly frocks and a succession of crimson co-ords formed the backbone of the @entity105 show colourful : tomato red was the hue of choice for the brains behind @entity105 by @entity111 tailoring : @entity105 's outsize silhouette was once more in evidence bold : print added interest to the collection 's limited palette elsewhere , day three got off to a flying start with @entity105 , firmly established as one of @entity122 's hottest names by designers @entity124 and @entity125			1
on this showing , their reign as one of the capital 's most exciting designer duos looks set to continue , courtesy of a show that combined gorgeous geometric prints with their trademark outsize tailoring			1
the palette was kept minimal , focused on black , charcoal , cream and jolts of bright tomato red , but that certainly did n't mean boring			0
highlights included a stunning shirt - waist dress , enlivened with print to hem and sleeve , and a tomato red tunic and trouser combo			2
more co-ords followed - a trend that does n't seem to be going anywhere soon - and some first lady friendly frocks , including a stunning cream number crafted from delicated lace and brightened with a panel of tomato red			0
expect to see @entity98 in it soon			0
just as diverting was the front row , which included @entity159 and socialite @entity160			0
living dolls : @entity163 's dollhouse presentation saw models perch at primary coloured dressing tables and even relaxing in a bubble filled bath pretty : powder pink and delicate pastels once again ruled the roost at @entity163 , a designer famous for her grasp of colour 90s cool : @entity174 showed that she 's still a 1990s girl at heart , referencing the decade 's penchant for houndstooth , extreme girliness and the odd bit of grunge following @entity105 was @entity183 who showed a confident collection awash with muted nudes and beiges - all the better to show off some of the best tailoring of fashion week so far			1
also offering a clever approach to cut and finish was @entity192 whose thoroughly @entity3 basics included a beautifully soft blue @entity195 knit and a sequence of librarian chic cream silk blouses			1
riffing on the librarian theme , @entity192 also showed a baggy olive trouser suit - perfect for stacking stray books in - and a succession of heavy velvet and whalecord skirts and dresses			1
bookish it certainly was but boring not at all			0
another to take a cerebral approach was shoe designer @entity163 , whose presentation involved models clad in 90s sweatshirt dresses and houndstooth perched at lilac dressing tables and flopped , long limbs modestly crossed , in bubble filled baths			0
while the set - up was eye - catching , it was upstaged by the shoes which for a / @entity218 , included chunky fur - filled mules and delicate strappy sandals jazzed up with a fluffy heel			0
once again , powder pink proved a winner , with @entity174 splashing it onto shoes in the shape of pretty pastel pink hearts and fluffy pom poms to maximum girly effect			0
tour de force : @entity232 proved yet again that he 's a dab hand at tailoring with a very clever grasp of colour and silhouette stunning : @entity232 's self - assured show emphasised , once more , why the designer is well worth a place at the top table of @entity3 fashion up next was another fashionistas favourite , @entity232 , who , unsurprisingly for a man who earned his fashion stripes consulting for @entity245 at @entity246 , is no slouch when it comes to knowing what women want to wear			1
the man who gave the world the one size fits all geometric print t - shirt dress was on winning form once more today , with a collection that combined relaxed tailoring with loose , wearable shifts and striking knife - pleat dresses			2
@entity232 opted for a surprisingly summery palette , with powder blue and cheerful cerise domninant although there was the odd flash of mustard and cobalt			0
in what has to be a first for a winter show , black and stark white were entirely absent , suggesting next autumn could be far more colourful than most expected			2
colour notwithstanding , highlights included a stunning knife pleat dress in petrol blue and white , and a gorgeously wearable cerise jumper teamed with a knife pleat skirt			2
on this evidence , summer 's love of all things pleated will be with us well after the snow arrives			2
summery : @entity232 showed tailoring in summery powder blue blues : @entity232 's penchant for blue also encompassed navy , cobalt and petrol @entity288 : a simple knitted cerise dress was lifted with three simple rosettes			2

the model , 21 , unveiled the @entity40 bag at @entity2 's a / *w14* show
other big names on the schedule today include @entity96 , @entity95 and @entity298
other highlights of the day so far , include @entity183 's *elegant* knits and @entity192 's librarian chic
