@entity1 interim executive chairman @entity0 has hinted @entity2 may not end up being the club 's new chief executive			1
@entity0 has stepped up from his non-executive role to take full command of the @entity8 champions for the time being as they search for former chief executive @entity12 's replacement			1
it was thought that role would go to @entity16 's right - hand man @entity2 following the @entity20 owner 's @entity18 power grab			1
@entity2 is working as a consultant for @entity1 , but may not become the new chief executive so far the club has only confirmed that the former @entity25 managing director is acting as a consultant along with @entity27 , another @entity16 associate			1
but @entity0 admitted to @entity28 on thursday morning that @entity2 is yet to even apply for the @entity30 ' top job			1
he said : ' i do n't think i should say ( how many people have applied for the chief executive role ) at this point			1
i have got some head - hunters helping me look for people			2
' i ca n't confirm that ( @entity2 has applied )			1
that would be unfair of me to say who has applied and who has n't			2
as you can imagine it is really early days			2
' i was looking at his cv but he has n't actually applied			2
he has n't actually said anything to me			0
he is here as a consultant			0
' interim boss @entity0 said @entity2 has not even applied for the role yet , but he had looked at his cv @entity0 ' new role was confirmed in an early - morning announcement to the @entity49			1
as well as finding someone to fill @entity12 's old role , the chartered accountant will also lead the search for @entity55 's replacement as finance director			0
both men were forced out of the club after @entity16 's succeeded in having a Â£ 2million loan accepted by the cash - strapped @entity61 giants			0
the terms of the facility now gives him the power to name their replacements - although the @entity68 is now set to investigate the latest developments in the @entity18 saga			0
any attempt to place @entity72 and @entity27 on the board could fall foul of @entity16 's agreement with @entity77 chiefs , which was designed to limit the @entity81 tycoon 's influence at @entity18 while he remains in control of @entity20			0
@entity16 signed the agreement , which restricts him to a share of no more than 10 per cent , in 2012			0
he currently holds an 8.92 per cent stake			0
the cameras are on @entity72 as he arrives at @entity18 to take up his new role as consultant the stock exchange statement said : ' @entity0 , non-executive chairman , will become executive chairman of @entity1 on a temporary basis with immediate effect			1
' in this role , he will liaise directly with senior staff within the club about the operation of the business , and he will oversee the recruitment of a new chief executive and finance director			1
' but @entity0 , who was appointed as @entity1 ' acting chairman in november last year and was re-elected at the club 's agm the following month , refused to put a time - scale on his recruitment drive			1
he said : ' the board have asked me to lead the search for a new chief exec and also for a finance director			2
' and obviously we are having a look at everything with the consultants			0
it 's a good opportunity to dig into everything while we are appointing these people			0
' we have got to do these things properly			0
we have got to make sure we get the right guy			0
obviously i would like to do it as fast as possible but at the same time i need to make sure i get the right person for @entity1			1
' we may put an interim finance director in , just to fill the gap			2
it 's the same for this role , we need the right person			0
