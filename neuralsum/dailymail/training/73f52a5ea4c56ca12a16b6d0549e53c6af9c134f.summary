she was once known as horticultural viagra but now , at the age of 47 , @entity2 says she 's too old for marriage @entity2 's smile is as wide as it ever was			1
it is the smile that , along with the scarlet @entity8 curls and penchant for not wearing a bra , made her the gardening world 's most famous pin - up			1
but it 's hard to know what is behind the smile			1
@entity16 has moved on from when she was a huge tv star both here , thanks to the popularity of @entity20 which was watched by 12 million people when it moved from @entity22 to @entity23 , and in the @entity25 where she hosted a gardening segment for @entity28 's breakfast show			1
back then , nicknamed ' horticultural @entity29 ' she sold more calendars than top models and pop bands			1
the passage from there to here has n't been kind			1
she still refuses to talk about the death of her mother and stepfather during the @entity40 a decade ago but it 's clear its impact was huge			1
for two years after she lost her beloved mum she turned down all offers of work and retreated to the @entity48 house she 'd been left in the will			1
by the time she was ready to work again the ship had sailed in the fickle world of television			1
there were new earthy women like @entity56 and @entity57 to obsess over			1
but she insists that fame is something she 's seen come and go with equanimity			1
' it 's quite nice to not have such a high profile although i am not sure my agent would agree , ' she grins			1
' i always found the fame thing a bit odd			1
i 'd walk along the high street and find lots of people staring at me			1
it was intimidating ; at first i would wonder whether i had left my flies undone			2
' the sex symbol thing was the most surprising thing of all			2
it was silly , totally ridiculous			2
i started @entity20 when i was 33 and i had n't been sexy until that point so i do n't know how i would suddenly become sexy			2
' because of all the fuss i did get some dodgy letters			2
i had a marriage proposal from @entity80 , from some farmer in the middle of the outback			2
now if people stop me in the street it 's because they want to tell me , " we 'd love you to bring @entity20 back "			2
but i tell them , " we 're too old "			2
i think it 's a show that was of its time ; we had great fun doing it but it was a different era			2
' @entity2 with her mother , @entity95 who tragically died in the @entity40 since then her career has veered off in all sorts of strange directions			1
she is still primarily a gardening expert and we are talking because she 's hosting a series of presentations at the @entity103 later this month with her former @entity20 colleague @entity104 , who was the construction expert on the programme			2
until this year they had n't worked together since @entity20 finished in 2005			2
' we saw each other yesterday and within seconds i was nagging him and he was saying " bloody hell , i forgot what you were like , " ' she giggles			2
@entity2 and @entity112 on the set of @entity20 @entity2 can also now put actress down on her cv			1
she took a short role in the 2010 touring production of @entity118 , happily acknowledging ' they did n't ask me because of my acting ability '			1
in the show – as in the film about a group of @entity124 activists who make a naked calendar for charity – she was forced to go nude			0
' it 's very well - choreographed so you ca n't see anything but it was still pretty nerve - racking , ' she says			1
' i got used to taking my clothes off – after about a month – but the acting was terrifying			0
' since then she 's become a panto regular			0
' i lend myself to @entity136 very well , ' she laughs			0
' it 's very silly but it 's a good experience			0
' @entity2 never expected to be famous ; she had her career mapped out in a very different direction			1
the plan was to take over the mill water garden centre which she already managed , near the @entity48 home where she grew up			0
when she was picked to be the water features expert on @entity20 , after being spotted at @entity149 by a producer , she was living with long term boyfriend @entity151 but the two split when she had a fling with the show 's sound man @entity154			0
@entity151 later said she had ' changed ' after finding fame but she says now ' the relationship would never have lasted , it was already on its last legs '			0
that was followed by another short affair with a crew member , another sound technician called @entity163 , but she has been pretty much single ever since			1
' i 'm too old now , certainly too old for marriage , there 's no point , ' she says			0
when i respond that 47 is not old – certainly not too old for love – she shakes her head			0
' you 're obviously too young to be cynical			0
i do think i 'm too old now			0
i ca n't see anything happening when it comes to romance ; somebody would have to really bowl me over			0
i am quite content without a man in my life			0
@entity2 is also an acclaimed actress , having appeared in the theatre production of @entity118 ' i 'm quite happy as i am with my cat , my dog and my horse			1
they 're all the company i need			1
i think that if i did meet someone i 'd prefer a partnership to marriage			0
that 's terrible is n't it ? very selfish , that 's what they say , is n't it ? but i like being able to do what i want			0
' sometimes that means going to the local pub after walking her dog , occasionally dinners with friends			0
but more often it 's being on her own , in her garden , with only a radio for company			1
' i 'm a @entity203 junkie , ' she laughs			0
' i do n't really watch any tv ; radio is so much more useful in the garden			0
on my ideal day i might spend three or four hours in the garden			0
and i 'll often sit outside in the evenings too , watching the birds on the bird feeders and the different creatures in the pond			0
there are no streetlights where i live so when the stars are out it 's very pretty , you can see all the bats			0
it makes me feel pretty content			0
' the @entity103 starts on friday 20 june , see www.blenheimflowershow.co.uk .			0
