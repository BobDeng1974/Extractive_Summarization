@entity2 parents who claim child benefit for their families in their home country should not receive the same amount as @entity8 workers , @entity0 said today			1
the deputy prime minister has ordered officials to find a legal way to slash the ‘ absurd ’ payments made for children who do not live in the @entity8			1
he said it was not fair that @entity8 pays £ 80 - a - month per child , but in @entity2 child benefit is worth only £ 18			1
@entity0 wants @entity8 to stop paying @entity8 rates for child benefit for children who live in countries where the rates are lower under @entity24 rules , the benefit has to be paid to @entity26 nationals who are working in @entity8 and paying national insurance – even if their families are based abroad			1
there are around 24,000 families claiming for 38,500 children , with two - thirds of the children based in @entity2			2
@entity34 has said the payments are ' wrong ' and vowed to scrap them altogether under wider @entity24 reforms , which he admits will ‘ take time ’			2
however , mr @entity0 believes @entity8 could act unilaterally now and cut the amount which is paid to match the child benefit rates in the countries where the children live			1
speaking on his @entity44 phone - in , mr @entity0 said : ‘ there ’s this thing about us paying child benefit to people who are working here but have got children elsewhere			1
‘ obviously that ’s absurd			0
i would like to deal with that overnight , but you have to wait for the treaties to change			0
but in the meantime here ’s an idea that might be worth exploring …			0
if there ’s a @entity2 couple here or a @entity2 parent here and they are receiving child benefit , i think they should receive child benefit at the £ 18 per month which is the child benefit rate in @entity2 , not the £ 80 rate that we pay them here in the @entity8			2
‘ after all the child is in @entity2			0
it saves a bit of money , but also symbolically it ’s important			0
’ two thirds of all child benefit sent abroad goes to pay for children in @entity2 , according to officials figures mr @entity0 conceded that there will be ‘ all sorts of legalities which might be difficult to straighten out ’			2
but he insisted : ‘ it ’s a fairer way of doing it			0
it ’s one of the things that we should do … i am getting people to look at it and as ever you get reams and reams of paper saying it ’s difficult			0
‘ do n’t worry i thump desks all the time and stamp feet , and i do so all the time			0
‘ freedom to move was never , should never have been and must n’t be freedom to claim			0
and that ’s the big distinction we need to make			0
’ child benefit in the @entity8 is paid at £ 20.30 a week for the first child and £ 13.40 for every other child			1
since last year families in the @entity8 with one person earning more than £ 50,000 have had their child benefit cut , and removed altogether if one earner has a salary of more than £ 60,000			1
child benefit in some countries is more generous than the @entity8 , worth around £ 115 per month in @entity113 , £ 160 in @entity114 and £ 155 in @entity115 .			1

deputy prime minister orders officials to find a way to cut costs
child benefit paid to @entity24 working in @entity8 even if families are abroad
*tories* want to scrap the payment as part of wide - ranging @entity24 reform
until then @entity130 wants to cut payments to equal home countries
