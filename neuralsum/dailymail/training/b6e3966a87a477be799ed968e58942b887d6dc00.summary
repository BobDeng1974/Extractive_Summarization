for some , drones represent a frightening future where people will be constantly surveyed			1
but one startup thinks small , unmanned aircraft should be seen as approachable and has even positioned them as flying pets that can be taken for a walk on a leash			1
there are strict rules governing where drones can be used and by whom , but keeping a drone on its lead could side step safety and some privacy concerns			2
easy to navigate : the drone does not rely on trained operators , gps or sophisticated sensing for controlled flight			0
to the user , flying the camera is as simple as holding a kite , and framing the picture is as easy as rotating your hand - held monitor			2
accountable and safe : existing drones can be difficult to manoeuvre in windy conditions and can be dangerous			0
the @entity25 's tether provides a safer way to fly and allows close - proximity operations			2
the tether provides visual accountability for bystanders and property owners , the company said			0
rule - abiding : the drone can be regulated as a kite under @entity50 ( @entity51 ) guidelines			0
@entity25 is a small quadrocopter that is compact and simple – designed to be used by people for taking aerial photographs of places and events such as family parties and weddings			1
it does not rely on gps , machine vision or even a compass for navigation , which should decrease the chances of crashes			0
@entity66 , the @entity67 - based roboticist behind the innovation , told the @entity69 : ‘ should something happen , the leash gives a robust fail safe - the vehicle reduces thrust and it automatically comes back to the operator			1
’ unlike more complex ‘ professional ’ drones , the @entity25 prototype can be launched and working in under one minute and can be flown by people with no experience of operating complicated systems , radios and complicated aircraft			1
view from above : unlike more complex ' professional ' drones , the @entity25 prototype can be launched and working in under one minute and can be flown by people with no experience of operating complicated systems , radios and complicated aircraft			1
it can take videos and stills ( pictured ) the company says : ‘ to the user , flying the camera is as simple as holding a kite , and framing the picture is as easy as rotating your hand - held monitor			1
’ @entity25 also claims to be easier to manoeuvre than more complex drones , which can be dangerous if they get close to buildings in windy conditions			1
‘ the @entity25 's tether provides a safer , more direct way to fly			1
it enables close - proximity operations and the tether provides visual accountability for bystanders and property owners , ’ the start - up said			0
dr @entity66 told @entity104 : ' we are passionate about making aerial photography safer and more accessible to everyone			2
' importantly , because the aircraft is tethered to a leash , it can be classified as a kite and therefore skirt laws governing the use of drones , the company claims			1
on a tight leash : ' the @entity25 's tether ( pictured ) provides a safer , more direct way to fly			1
it enables close - proximity operations and the tether provides visual accountability for bystanders and property owners , ' the @entity119 start - up said @entity25 is a small quadrocopter drone that is compact and simple - designed to be used by people for taking aerial photographs of places and events such as family parties and wedding ( pictured ) the @entity131 ( @entity131 ) said operating rules for standard @entity133 ( @entity133 ) include : they must never be flown beyond the normal unaided ‘ line of sight ’ of the person operating them			1
this is generally measured as 1,640ft ( 500m ) horizontally or 400ft ( 122m ) vertically			0
an unmanned aircraft fitted with a camera must always be flown at least 164ft ( 50m ) distance away from a person , vehicle , building or structure			0
an unmanned aircraft fitted with a camera must not be flown within 492ft ( 150m ) of a congested area or large group of people , such as a sporting event or concert			2
consideration must be shown to other airspace users			0
therefore unmanned aircraft should not be used in the vicinity of airports or within restricted airspace			0
commercial drones are banned in the @entity157 and there are laws banning their flight within close proximity of people , buildings and bridges for example in the @entity166			2
@entity167 , general counsel for the @entity168 is unsure whether the leash would bypass such laws			2
the @entity166 's @entity131 told @entity104 that it is difficult to know whether the aircraft would fall within current rules and regulations without knowing more about where it would be flown and other specifics			2
dr @entity66 was inspired to create the drone on a leash during street protests in @entity181 in @entity182 when he realised how useful an aerial perspective would be for journalists reporting the event			0
but the idea evolved in an unlikely direction and dr @entity66 saw potential for the technology to be used as a toy as well as by photographers , archaeologists and architects			0
he has created a prototype of the ‘ pet ’ drone based heavily on a quadrocopter he bought from a shop , which he demonstrated at the recent @entity199 conference using a leash for a small dog			1
his device can shoot video as well as take photos and he thinks that while people fear military drones and large unmanned vehicles flying high above them , they will be less suspicious of a flying camera on a leash used by normal people			1
he said : ‘ people treat you normally - it is like a flying pet			0
it always has a physical connection to the operator ’			0
there is no launch date or price for the drone yet , but it will be available to pre-order ' soon '			0
safe : because the aircraft is tethered to a leash , it can be classified as a kite and therefore skirt laws governing the use of drones , the company claims			1
here , the drones are demonstrated at the recent @entity199 conference			0

a @entity67 startup 's designed a simple quadrocopter to take aerial photos of places and events without making people feel *uneasy* because it 's tethered
unlike more complex ‘ professional ’ drones , the @entity25 prototype can be launched and working in under one minute
because the aircraft is tethered to a leash , it can be classified as a kite and therefore skirt laws governing the use of drones , the company claims
