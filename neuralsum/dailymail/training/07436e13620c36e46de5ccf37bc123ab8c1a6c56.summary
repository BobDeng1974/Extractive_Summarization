now that the @entity3 have been formally enshrined as the only administration that matters , and the @entity5 have been seduced into believing they matter too , the five - @entity1 series starting in @entity2 on wednesday has a lot to live up to			2
after all , if the players do n’t match the star billing currently afforded to the men in suits , things could get rather awkward			2
giants off the field , pygmies on it – this is not a slogan that would sit comfortably alongside the omnipotence of @entity20 and @entity21			2
we exaggerate , of course			2
@entity24 sit fourth in the test rankings , @entity27 fifth			1
it ’s like the 2009 ashes , when two mid-table sides did flawed battle until @entity27 picked @entity32 at the last minute and won at @entity33			1
another left - field move could swing the result this time			2
the @entity45 fear for @entity36 and the fitness of @entity47 and @entity48			0
the @entity49 worry about their ability to claim 20 wickets , and their lack of experience			0
either way , we have been spared too much gloating - in - advance			0
the likelihood is that we will get a cagey series			0
@entity36 is lucky to be captain after the fiasco at @entity60 , where his blinkered tactics condemned @entity27 to their first home series defeat by @entity65			1
if @entity24 go 2 - 0 up , @entity27 will be looking for a new captain			1
yet @entity36 ’s one saving grace is that he will be up against a man who has not led his side to a test victory outside @entity24 for three years			1
since beating @entity71 in @entity72 in june 2011 , @entity24 have played 14 matches overseas , drawing four and losing 10			1
and it is a sequence that , for @entity75 , includes several days akin to @entity36 at @entity60			1
almost as bad as @entity24 ’s 4 - 0 defeats in @entity27 and @entity77 were their failures to win last winter in @entity79 and @entity80			1
in the first of those , it was – mystifyingly – @entity84 who stood accused of bottling it after closing on 450 for seven in pursuit of 458 on an up - and - down last - day pitch at the wanderers			0
and at @entity80 , with @entity90 beginning the fourth day effectively six for five , @entity75 was alarmingly quick to shed his slips			0
@entity92 responded with a triple - century			0
despite his reputation as an aggressive limited - overs batsman , @entity75 is not a man for whom test - match offence comes naturally			0
the reason he is still in a job tells you plenty about the different priorities of @entity45 and @entity49 cricket			0
under @entity75 , @entity24 have been the best limited - overs tournament team in the world , winning the @entity104 , the @entity105 , and almost completing the hat - trick before losing to @entity65 in the final of the @entity108 in @entity109 in april			1
even if @entity27 ever manage to reach another @entity104 final , it ’s unlikely that this success would spare the captain if he were to keep losing @entity1 series – especially to @entity77 , especially 5 - 0			2
that does n’t make the @entity45 way better ; it ’s just different			0
drive to succeed : cook bats in the nets ahead of the first test for more cricket - related snippets , feel free to go to twitter.com / the_topspin @entity75 also inhabits a different world from @entity36 ’s , straddling the sporting and celebrity nexuses with a calm assurance that may stem , in part , from his own sense of inviolability			1
whenever journalists attempt to ask him a politically sensitive question at a press conference , a @entity3 minder steps in			0
yesterday , the @entity3 ’s own website published an exclusive interview with him – the first that has appeared anywhere for some time			0
it goes without saying that his woeful record overseas did n’t get an airing			2
yet this , it appears , is how things work : @entity75 speaks on his own terms , or not at all			0
in one sense , @entity36 and @entity75 do have something in common			0
both have the blessings of higher forces : @entity75 is protected by @entity20 , while @entity36 is being cheered on by @entity27 md @entity149 , who has staked much of his reputation on backing him , while sacking @entity151			0
limited appeal : @entity75 is a superb one - day captain but is less effective in test matches and yet you suspect something will have to give over the next seven weeks			2
victory for @entity24 , and @entity36 wo n’t be able to blame a @entity157 or an @entity158			1
victory for @entity27 , and even @entity20 may reflect that @entity75 ’s captaincy just is n’t working at @entity161			0
the whole thing could hinge on how well @entity163 and @entity164 handle the swinging ball – assuming it swings at all			0
their partnerships could provide the sights and sounds of the summer			0
otherwise , do n’t be surprised if we are not treated to a classic , for this series pits a team that has forgotten how to win against a team that wins only at home			0
and both captains are – or at least ought to be – concerned about what happens next			0
may the less fearful side prevail			0
it ’s easy to mock cricketers for being dull interviewees , so let ’s hear it for @entity184 , whose response to a question in @entity187 prompted uncharitable thoughts of a wind - up			1
asked which living person he most admired and why , @entity192 said : ‘ @entity194 ( @entity195 mp for @entity196 ) , she is so honest and consistent			1
she is a role model of mine – in any decision i think , “ what would @entity194 do ? ” ’ and to think we always imagined that the inspiration behind @entity184 ’s you - guys - are - history seven for 57 against @entity84 at @entity33 in 1994 had been @entity205 … centre of attention : @entity184 ( centre ) walks off at @entity33 after taking nine for 57 vs @entity84 @entity209 writes in the @entity210 that part of the reason @entity213 is held in ‘ high regard ’ by the players he has worked with is his ‘ healthy disregard for the media ’			1
@entity209 uses his – presumably well - paid – column in the media to make this point			1
quite obviously cricketers are not going to enjoy every word that ’s ever been spoken or written about them			0
but it seems strange to applaud as ‘ healthy ’ a disregard for the people who convey the sport to those not lucky enough to attend matches in person – especially when you ’re now one of those people yourself			2
disregard : @entity209 ( left ) enjoys taking a pop at the media despite now being part of it how democratic is the new @entity238 now that most the power lies in the hands of @entity24 , with a little left over for @entity27 and @entity77 ? last week we were reminded of the venues for @entity238 events in the next cycle of media and sponsorship rights ( 2015 - 23 ) – and provided with an answer to the question			1
after the forthcoming @entity104 early next year in @entity77 and @entity90 will come the following : the 2016 @entity108 ( in @entity24 ) ; the @entity249 ( @entity27 ) ; the @entity250 ( @entity27 ) ; the 2020 @entity108 ( @entity77 ) ; the @entity251 ( @entity24 ) ; and the 2023 @entity104 ( @entity24 )			1
in other words , it will be 10 years at the earliest before the global event takes place anywhere outside the confines of the @entity256			1
let ’s hope the rest of the world does n’t lose interest in the meantime			2
there was uproar last week when people took offence at the way other people had taken offence at the fact that @entity270 had never heard of @entity271			1
but what did they expect ? a sane and rational shrug of the shoulders from manic fans who regard @entity271 as a deity ? no , me neither			1
who are ya ? @entity270 said she had never head of @entity271 ( right )			1

cook lucky to still be captain after loss to @entity65 at @entity60
@entity24 have not won a @entity285 overseas for three years
@entity184 most admires @entity194 mp
@entity209 should stop having a pop at the media now he *'s* part of it
the @entity256 dominating the *hosting* of world events
why should @entity270 have heard of @entity271 ?
