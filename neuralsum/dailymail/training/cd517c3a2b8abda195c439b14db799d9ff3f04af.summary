@entity0 has jokingly told supporters that he has never been asked to produce his birth certificate , as president @entity3 has , because everyone knows that he and his wife are from @entity6			1
there were gasps from reporters and laughs and cheers from the crowd of thousands as @entity0 , in an ill - judged attempt at humour , gave @entity15 the opening to portray him as subscribing to the ‘ @entity19 ’ conspiracy theory that @entity3 is not an @entity20			1
‘ no one has ever asked to see my birth certificate , ’ @entity0 said			0
‘ they know that this was the place that we were born and raised			0
’ joke ? @entity0 told supporters that he has never been asked to produce his birth certificate , as president @entity3 has , because everyone knows that he and his wife are from @entity6 there was an immediate , indignant response from the @entity3 campaign			1
@entity31 , campaign spokesman , said in a statement : ‘ throughout this campaign , governor @entity0 has embraced the most strident voices in his party instead of standing up to them			2
‘ it ’s one thing to give the stage in @entity40 to @entity41 , @entity42 , and @entity43			0
but governor @entity0 ’s decision to directly enlist himself in the birther movement should give pause to any rational voter across @entity20			1
’ @entity0 was telling the crowd in @entity49 , @entity6 on friday that he and wife @entity50 had been born in hospitals nearby			1
‘ now i love being home in this place where @entity50 and i were raised , where both of us were born			0
@entity50 was born in @entity56 , ’ he said			0
‘ i was born in @entity57			0
' campaigning : @entity20 @entity58 presidential candidate @entity0 ( 2nd l ) and his running mate @entity60 greet supporters during a campaign event at a farm in @entity49 , @entity6 , today it was then that he said that he had never been asked to show his birth certificate			1
the quip was an obvious reference to the theory propounded on the right - wing fringe that @entity3 was not born in @entity70 , as a newspaper notice at the time and the long - form birth certificate produced by the @entity75 show , but in @entity76			1
for @entity0 , the subject is a perilous one because many independent voters view such theories as racist and an attempt to de-legitimise @entity20 ’s first black president			2
@entity0 is more vulnerable on the issue than many other @entity58 because he publicly accepted the endorsement of @entity41 , the billionaire property mogul and reality television star , who is an outspoken proponent of @entity19 theories			2
at the time , @entity0 said he did not agree with @entity41 on @entity19			0
‘ you know , i do n't agree with all the people who support me and my guess is they do n't all agree with everything i believe in			0
but i need to get 50.1 per cent or more and i 'm appreciative to have the help of a lot of good people			0
' @entity95 , a @entity0 spokesman , immediately sought to downplay the comment , saying that ‘ the governor 's been clear on this issue many times before ’ and viewed it as settled			2
proof is in the papers : mr @entity3 released his birth certificate last april to try and quiet a debate within @entity58 circles that he was not born in the country ‘ the governor has always said , and has repeatedly said , he believes the president was born here in the @entity20			1
he was only referencing that @entity6 , where he is campaigning today , is the state where he himself was born and raised			0
’ @entity31 ’s mention of @entity42 and @entity43 was an attempt to link @entity0 to two of the most controversial figures on the @entity58 right			2
@entity42 is the @entity116 sheriff who calls himself ‘ @entity20 ’s toughest sheriff ’ and has gained notoriety for his determination to round up and arrest illegal immigrants			0
@entity42 has also called into question @entity3 ’s citizenship and carried out an investigation that concluded his long - form birth certificate was a forgery			0
@entity43 is the @entity126 secretary of state who has filed a lawsuit challenging @entity3 ’s directive that illegal immigrants brought to the @entity20 as children by their parents should be allowed to stay in the country			2
the claim that @entity3 is not a natural - born citizen of the @entity20 and is therefore not eligible for the presidency sprung up during the 2008 election campaign , when his official birth certificate was released by his aides			1
there have been various theories put forward – that he was born in @entity76 or that he became an @entity141 as a child or that he was a dual citizen at birth			0
a number of lawsuits have been brought on the issue , to no avail			0
conclusion : @entity149 sheriff @entity148 announced on tuesday , july 17 , 2012 , in @entity150 that president @entity3 's birth certificate , as presented by the @entity75 in april 2011 , is a forgery based on an investigation by the @entity148 's office in april last year , the @entity75 released @entity3 ’s long - form birth certificate after polls suggested that at least a quarter of @entity20 were unsure where he was born			1
during the early stages of the @entity58 primary campaign , @entity41 , who said he was weighing candidacy , gained traction in the polls by alleging @entity3 was not born in the @entity20 @entity0 advisers said that his joke was unplanned			1
but many @entity3 supporters were quick to suggest that it was a dog whistle to racists and an attempt to whip up anger			0
republicans were quick to say that an @entity3 adviser had suggested @entity0 was a felon and a super pac campaign ad linked him to the death of a woman who succumbed to cancer			1
at best , @entity0 ’s joke was a tactical blunder because it undermined his promise to run a substantive campaign about big issues and took the focus of the campaign away from what voters care about most – jobs and the economy			2
@entity0 was born in @entity190 , @entity6 in 1947 and his wife @entity50 in @entity192 , @entity6 in 1949			1
@entity3 was born in @entity193 , @entity70 in 1961 and @entity41 in @entity194 , @entity195 in 1946 .			1

@entity0 said everyone knows he and his wife are from @entity6
the joke was a reference to the ' birther ' conspiracy theory that @entity3 was born in @entity76 and not @entity70
@entity3 campaign said the @entity58 's remarks ' should give pause to any rational voter across @entity20 '
