ice cool @entity1 mp @entity0 does not seem the romantic type			1
number crunching is his skill			0
when his comprehensive school head tried to ban him from taking o - level maths , he kicked up a fuss – and passed with flying colours			2
@entity0 made a pile in the @entity12 , quit by the time he was 40 and last year – just three years after entering the @entity13 – became financial secretary to the treasury , the most senior minister outside the @entity16			1
@entity0 , @entity1 's first @entity19 - @entity18 mp with his wife @entity20 , the childhood sweetheart who became his wife his meteoric rise includes : @entity23 seems certain to win @entity16 promotion in the next reshuffle – with some tipping the @entity1 ’ first @entity19 - @entity18 mp as a future leader			1
but scratch the steely surface and there is a softer side to @entity31 mp @entity0 , 44 , as he showed when he wooed wife and childhood sweetheart @entity20 as teenagers in @entity34			1
‘ i got a summer job at the local @entity37 insurance company and she sat opposite			2
love over a stapler ! ’ he laughs			2
every time i went to get the stapler i ’d touch a finger , then another finger – and there was no objection – eventually i managed to ask her if she would come to the sandwich shop with me			2
i ’ve never looked back			2
’ he travelled the globe , made his fortune and returned to marry his @entity52 rose @entity20 , his only serious girlfriend			1
there is an @entity55 courtliness about it			0
@entity0 worked for @entity64 in the @entity65 in the 1990s , the era of @entity59 excesses , but there any resemblance to @entity63 ’s licentious @entity62 ends – hardly surprising when @entity0 recalled his upbringing as we met at his @entity69 office overlooking @entity71 ’s @entity70			1
his dad , @entity72 , came to @entity19 from @entity18 in 1961 with just £ 1 in his pocket and settled in @entity74 , where @entity0 , one of five brothers , was born			1
@entity72 ’s readiness to work all hours as a bus driver earned him the nickname ‘ mr @entity79 ’			1
when @entity0 was four , his dad took over a ladieswear shop in inner - city @entity34 and the family moved into a two - bedroom flat above it			1
‘ three brothers were in one bedroom and myself and a younger brother were with my parents in the other			1
’ @entity90 in his office alongside a picture of his political heroine @entity93 they lived in @entity95 , described recently as ‘ @entity19 ’s worst street , a lawless hellhole where murder , rape , shootings , drug - pushing , prostitution , knifings and violent robbery are commonplace ’			1
@entity0 remembers the 1980s riots in @entity34 ’s nearby @entity107 ’s district when he was ten			1
but decades later , as a newboy mp , he gave short shrift to an official from the homeless charity , @entity111 , who complained about housing benefit cuts			0
‘ i said : “ by your definition you ’ve just told me i was homeless as a child			0
that was n’t my experience			0
” it was a small home but we had a great family life with lots of love and affection			0
’ his comprehensive , @entity126 on the outskirts of @entity34 , was tough			0
‘ i was naughty , more interested in watching @entity128 than homework			0
’ @entity0 got into a fight with a racist pupil who called him ‘ @entity132 ’			1
the boy was expelled , but it had a happy ending ten years later			0
‘ i bumped into him in a shopping centre lift			0
he said : “ @entity0 is n’t it ? i ’m sorry for what i did , ” and we shook hands			1
’ @entity0 ’s naughtiness ended abruptly when his dad read the riot act			1
‘ he said : “ this is what i went through , do n’t let me down			1
” i felt really bad			0
’ meanwhile , mum took her sons to the library and forced them to read			0
@entity0 left with @entity151 o - level , but had to fight for that , too			1
‘ hardly anyone did @entity151 o - level			2
the school said they would only pay for me to sit @entity156 [ lower than o - level ]			0
but i argued – and my dad paid £ 32 for me to do it – a lot in those days			0
’ he went on to get a degree in economics and politics			0
unlike guilt - ridden @entity164 , who sends his children to state schools , ex comp boy @entity0 has no such hang ups			1
his four children , girls of five , ten and 14 and a boy of 12 , go to private schools			0
‘ we do what ’s best for them , ’ he says , matter of factly			1
in pride of place in his office is a portrait of his heroine , @entity93			0
he has been a fan since the precocious age of 11			0
‘ i instinctively thought , “ i really admire this woman ”			0
my dad lived through the winter of discontent and used to vote @entity184 , but switched to @entity93 , saying , “ look how she ’s sorting out the country ”			0
’ he sounds like a multi-cultural @entity187			0
‘ i ’ve got the hair style ! ’ says @entity0 , who lost his hair in his 20s and wet shaves it , adding to his city slicker image			1
while other lads threw paper pellets at each other on the school bus , he grabbed a discarded copy of @entity200 , sat on his own and devoured news of @entity203 ’s latest triumph in the @entity204 or miners ’ strike			2
he suffered more discrimination at his first interview for a @entity12 job , with venerable @entity19 merchant bank , @entity211			2
‘ they were so stuck up			0
they invited me into a hotel room , six men in pinstripe suits up on a stage with me standing below			0
it was obvious i would n’t get the job			0
’ but he was perfect for @entity64 who were ‘ more interested in the hunger in my belly ’			2
he was later head - hunted by @entity220 , but refuses to comment on claims he made £ 20million in 15 years			1
he has the confidence – and prudence – of a self - made man			2
he drives a £ 35,000 @entity225 , though the @entity227 mp quickly adds it is to support the local @entity229 car company , and buys his suits ‘ cheaply in @entity232 or @entity233 ’ not @entity231			1
@entity0 and his wife live in a £ 4million home in @entity236 , own a £ 2million house which is rented out in @entity238 , another in @entity34 and a constituency residence			1
‘ i worked hard for 20 years , and was paid well and achieved things for me and my family , ’ he says defiantly			2
he slammed the door in the face of @entity245 ’s proposed mansion tax with gusto			0
‘ we already have a tax on people ’s properties called council tax and i do n’t see a case for another one			1
’ @entity0 is proud of his @entity255 background , but regards himself as @entity19			1
asked if he will observe @entity256 he hesitates before replying : ‘ i ’m not practising			0
’ does he read the @entity257 ? ‘ no , but how many people call themselves @entity259 and visit a church ? @entity261 and @entity262 are the same thing			2
’ he refuses to say if he has his eyes on @entity265 , but does not see his @entity268 - @entity267 roots as a bar			2
‘ @entity19 is the world ’s most tolerant country			1
if you have talent , colour and gender is less important			0
’ could a state educated child from an under - represented minority who had old fashioned hard work and morals drummed into him by a shopkeeper father become pm by raw ability and doggedness ? @entity0 ’s heroine @entity203 did			1
he clearly dreams he could , too .			0

*muslim* @entity0 was raised in a flat above a shop with five brothers
a former banker he made a reported £ 20million before quitting last year
he helped to draw up the last *budget* with mentor @entity292
@entity31 mp seems certain to be promoted in next *cabinet* reshuffle
some even tip @entity19 's first @entity19 - @entity18 mp as a future leader
playing a key role in drawing up the @entity301 with his mentor and boss , @entity292 .
@entity307 @entity306 by linking his ‘ *cynical* ’ refusal to back *military* action in @entity310 to @entity312 ’s *invasion* of @entity313 , claiming he was ‘ completely unfit to lead @entity19 ’ .
calling the euro a ‘ *bankruptcy* machine ’ and saying he would not shrink from quitting the @entity318 if it wo n’t give @entity19 a better deal .
turning from *poacher* to *gamekeeper* to lead a *crackdown* on rogue bankers .
