@entity15 ' @entity3 died after plummeting from the @entity17 ride while it was upside down and hitting a metal support beam at @entity4 on july 19			1
six flags announced last week that the notorious 153 - foot tall roller coaster will reopen this weekend with new seat belts and redesigned restraint bar pads following an internal investigation			1
while the company maintains a mechanical failure was not to blame for @entity28 's tragic fall , her family have accused the park of negligence and operating a faulty ride			1
the $ 1 million lawsuit , filed yesterday , names @entity33 , @entity33 , @entity35 and @entity4 as defendants			2
according to the suit , @entity28 , who also went by the surname @entity37 , was in the front left seat of the train ’s second car behind her daughter and son - in - law			1
the car had no seat belt or shoulder harness , only a single lap or ' t - bar ' to restrain passengers , @entity45 reported			2
' as the roller - coaster was in its first large descent , @entity3 ’s daughter heard screaming and yelling behind her , and turned to see her mother in the process of being thrown out of the car , out from behind the safety in her seat , ' the suit states			1
' she was then catapulted many feet below onto the metal roof of a tunnel , ' the lawsuit states			0
before the mother of two fell about 75 feet , witnesses said she had complained her harness was n't fastened securely			0
' they did n't secure her right			0
one of the employees from the park — one of the ladies — she asked her to click her more than once , and they were like , ' as long you heard it click , you 're ok			0
' @entity90 is like , ' click , click , click			0
' ' a witness told the @entity92			0
' @entity93 only clicked once			0
hers was the only one that went down once , and she did n't feel safe , but they let her still get on the ride			0
' ominous : witnesses said they heard @entity3 complain about her harness before she fell the suit states @entity28 's daughter and son - in - law were forced to complete the ride for ' what seemed like an interminable time knowing that @entity3 had been thrown out of the ride and not knowing whether she was dead or seriously injured and in need of immediate medical attention '			1
it also claimed @entity33 employees initially refused to believe that @entity28 had been thrown off the ride			1
' it ’s a tragedy of the highest order , ' @entity15 attorney @entity111 , who filed the suit in @entity112 yesterday on the family ’s behalf , told @entity45			0
' i believe it should have been avoided and could have been avoided			0
' following a nearly two - month investigation by the ' ride train manufacturer , internal engineers and external experts ' , the @entity119 has given the park approval to start up the ride again			2
@entity33 officials said it has now added ' incremental and overlapping safety measures ' to the ride , including re-designed restraint - bar pads from the manufacturer and new seat belts			1
the park will also now provide a coaster ride seat at the entrance to allow guests with ' unique body shapes and sizes ' to see if they fit in the restraint			1
' we are heartbroken and will forever feel the pain and sadness of this tragic accident , ' @entity144 , president of @entity4 , said			2
' the safety of our guests and employees is our company ’s absolute highest priority and we try to take every reasonable precaution to eliminate the risk of accidents			0
' @entity144 said he and his family would be among the first riders this weekend			0
devastating : @entity28 's family is suing @entity4 for negligence after the tragic accident the @entity28 family ’s suit says @entity33 operators have known for decades the extreme dangers posed by such rides			1
this is the park ’s second fatality			0
in 1999 , a 28 - year - old @entity166 woman died and 10 others were injured when a boat capsized on the @entity170 ride			0
in 2006 , nine park patrons were injured on the @entity172 when one of the mechanical bearings that spins the ride malfunctioned			2
' more often than not , the response of the @entity33 defendants to roller - coaster tragedies at their parks has been merely to feign surprise and to belatedly add safety belts in an attempt to calm the public ’s fears , ' the lawsuit states			2
@entity45 also reports the suit states that inspections done on the roller coasters since @entity28 ’s death ' showed that various parts of the security systems on the ride were experiencing inconsistencies and intermittent failures			1
' ' in addition , @entity33 has now admitted that , after these inspections , they replaced a ‘ limit switch ’ for a restraint in the very car in which @entity3 was riding because @entity33 found the switch to be defective , ' the suit states			2
the @entity17 , which rises 14 stories high and has a 79 - degree first drop ( the steepest in the world for a wooden roller coaster ) , had been closed since @entity28 ’s death			1
the roller coaster debuted as an all - wooden ride in 1990 , and reopened in 2011 redesigned with a steel track during the theme park 's 50th anniversary			1
the ride 's tallest height is 153 feet and has a drop of 147 feet .			0
