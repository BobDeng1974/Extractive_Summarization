being a billionaire is no longer just for the boys - at least in the @entity2			2
a new map showcasing the richest woman in every state of the country proves that there are plenty of ladies making bank these days , and a whole lot of bank at that			1
be it through their own ingenuity , hard work or , in some cases , inheritance , there are more female billionaires in this country than ever before			0
the top two spots go to the ladies of @entity31 , with @entity46 's $ 37.6 billion fortune making her the wealthiest woman in all of @entity48 and her sister @entity49 reigning over @entity50 with a worth of $ 33.5 billion			1
other notables include @entity53 ' widow @entity52 , whose $ 15.6 billion have her on top in @entity56 , and @entity57 , who is the richest self - made billionaire on the list and wealthiest woman in @entity60 with $ 5.2 billion , money she made by as the owner of the @entity63 , a medical device company she co-founded with her late husband @entity64			1
first ladies of tech : @entity67 ( left ) , the widow of @entity53 , was tops on @entity56 , but @entity71 ( right ) , wife of @entity70 , was nowhere to be found on the list the list also includes women whose wealth is combined with their partners , like @entity77 , who is worth an estimated $ 66.1 billion when you factor in her husband @entity41 , and @entity80 , who takes the honors as @entity83 ' wealthiest lady with $ 36 billion when you include her husband @entity84 ' wealth			0
oddly , by this measure one would think @entity88 ' wife @entity87 and @entity90 's wife @entity89 would land on the list as the top ladies in @entity93 and @entity94 repectively , but that is not the case			0
see the entire list here .			0

a new map *identifies* who the richest woman is in every state in the country
like most lists of wealthy @entity2 , *members* of the @entity31 family are on top , with @entity33 and @entity46 both worth more than $ *30* million
in terms of self - made ladies , @entity57 reigns *supreme* with $ 5.2 billion
