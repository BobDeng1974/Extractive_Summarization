ceasefire : the violence erupted as both nations observe a five - day ceasefire to hold talks in @entity20 , @entity21 demonstration : masked with hijabs , men found rubble from the bomb - hit streets to hurl at the border guards an elderly @entity22 joined the younger faction to react against the ' @entity7 occupation ' of the @entity13 demands : @entity96 wants full control of the border crossings , while @entity7 wants the territory disarmed the proposal is believed to include the lifting of some restrictions , which would let @entity96 's @entity104 - backed president @entity103 assume responsibility for border crossings			1
@entity7 officials have said little about the negotiations , saying only that the country 's security needs must be met			0

reconstruction : @entity15 officials vow to negotiate support to rebuild the border zone , battered by conflict reaction : a man hurls back a tear gas cannister thrown by @entity7 soldiers to control the mass outburst an @entity7 military spokesman said they had ' no knowledge ' of the alleged shooting that sparked the riot ' the proposed agreement states in many places that lifting the blockade will come through measures and mechanisms agreed upon between @entity7 and the @entity143 , and this means @entity7 will always have the upper hand , and might return the situation on the crossings back to the way it used to be before the war , ' he said			1
