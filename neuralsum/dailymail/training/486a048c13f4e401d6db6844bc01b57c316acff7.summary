dozens of wealthy businessmen with links to @entity24 's government are based outside the country , as are their prized yachts , some of which are worth as much as £ 1billion			1
super-rich @entity15 such as @entity32 could be caught up in rounds of sanctions directed against @entity5 second ride : @entity32 also has a second yacht named @entity37 , worth £ 105million @entity39 - list : @entity32 is worth around £ 5.4billion @entity31 , worth £ 1billion , and @entity37 , worth £ 105million , are both the possessions of @entity42 owner and super-rich @entity5 @entity32			1
@entity31 , the main vessel , is 535ft long and can hold 34 guests across 18 cabins			0
it has two swimming pools , a pair of helipads , a nightclub , cinema , theatre , submarine and missile defence system			0
it is thought to be @entity37 , a more humble affair , is just 380ft long , has a single swimming pool and nine cabins which can hold 18			0
this could make them a target for sanctions by the international community , and they could be impounded by court as a way to ' make life difficult ' for those at the top and exert pressure on @entity5			1
super-wealthy businessmen including @entity42 owner @entity32 , metals trader @entity72 and energy magnate @entity73 have strong links to the @entity15 leader and also flaunt their wealth with glamorous ships			1

valued at around £ 100million , the vessel has space for 20 guests and features a pool , and hot tub and two helipads @entity81 has been described by @entity91 as ' the wealthiest man in @entity5 '			2
he amassed his £ 11billion fortune from metals trading and his telecoms company @entity95 , which is the second largest mobile carrier in @entity5			2
he also owns a newspaper and a substantial stake in @entity98			0
splashing out : @entity99 , owned by @entity100 , is another superyacht owned by a @entity5 billionaire features : the huge yacht , pictured moored in @entity105 , can hold 20 guests , as well as two smaller boats the vessels could become targets of governments looking to teach @entity5 a lesson , and become a ' symbolic ' way to discipline the country , alongside wider sanctions being considered against the @entity15 economy			1
dr @entity116 , an expert from the @entity118 think - tank , said there was a ' stronger case than ever ' for seizing the ships , which would send a ' symbolic but important message ' to @entity5			1
' the point of these sanctions is to get at the people who enable @entity24 to act as he is doing - and sanctions are one of the best ways of doing that			2
' ' it 's part of a wider clamping - down on them , their lifestyle they lead in the @entity135 while facilitating and enabling @entity24 to do as he has been doing in eastern @entity136 and @entity5			1
a-team : @entity73 is the owner of the above superyacht , named a in honour of his wife super-rich : @entity73 a , pictured above on the open seas , is the £ 200million ship of billionaire @entity73			0

' there 's a legitimate argument for looking at their broader lifestyles , and manifestations of ostentatious wealth , like yachts for example			0
' @entity24 has been blamed by the @entity135 for the attack last week which led to the jet being shot down			1
it is believed a surface - to - air missile used by @entity179 rebels brought down the blame , killing all 298 on board			0
other experts said that while sanctions on oligarch 's yachts would send a strong signal , it could be difficult to enact because governments would need to prove the men were directly linked to the situation			2
it was also suggested that authorities in ports where oligarchs ' tend to moor their prize possessions could be reluctant to seize the ships for fear of scaring off other super-rich holidaymakers			0
a spokesman for the @entity201 think - tank told @entity202 : ' dictators like @entity204 and the @entity205 have had their yachts impounded in the past			0
' sanctions are always a bit of a mixed bag - if you 're trying to ostracise a country they can be quite effective			0
' for individuals , you can make life very difficult for them - but in this case it 's not clear how much influence these people have on @entity24 and @entity5			1
