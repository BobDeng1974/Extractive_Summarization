by @entity0 a new study has found eating probiotics could help lower blood pressure , protecting against heart disease and stroke eating probiotics regularly could help lower blood pressure , reducing the risk of heart disease and stroke			1
the live micro-organisms naturally occur in the gut but are also commonly found in yoghurt and dietary supplements			0
researchers at the @entity14 and @entity15 in @entity16 examined data from nine trials involving more than 540 participants			2
they found consuming the live bacteria lowered people 's blood pressure levels - particularly in those with higher readings			1
probiotics with multiple species of bacteria also worked better than those containing a single type of bacterium			1
lead author dr @entity31 , said : ' the small collection of studies we looked at suggest regular consumption of probiotics can be part of a healthy lifestyle to help reduce high blood pressure , as well as maintain healthy blood pressure levels			1
' this includes probiotics in yoghurt , fermented and sour milk and cheese , and probiotic supplements			2
' despite the benefits identified in consuming probiotics , the study found taking the supplements for less than eight weeks did not affect blood pressure			1
dr @entity52 added : ' we believe probiotics might help lower blood pressure by having other positive effects on health , including improving cholesterol , reducing blood glucose and insulin resistance ; and by helping to regulate the hormone system that regulates blood pressure and fluid balance			1
' the studies looking at probiotics and blood pressure tend to be small			0
' moreover , two studies had a short duration of three to four weeks of probiotic consumption , which might have affected the overall results of the analysis			0
' she said additional studies are needed before doctors can confidently recommend probiotics for high blood pressure control and prevention			2
the study was published in the journal @entity81			0
commenting on the research , @entity82 , @entity83 at the @entity84 , said : ' having high blood pressure puts you at greater risk of cardiovascular disease including heart attack and stroke , so it ’s vital we do all we can to keep our levels in check			1
' while this is an interesting review of the research in this area , it ’s too soon to start recommending probiotics for lowering blood pressure			0
' with only a handful of studies involving a limited number of participants and conducted for only short periods , we need more research to confirm the findings seen here			0
' in the meantime , there are a number of well - established lifestyle changes that we can make to keep our blood pressure healthy			0
' eating less salt , more fruit and vegetables and being physically active and maintaining a healthy body weight are all tried and tested ways to do this			0
' it is thought probiotics might help lower blood pressure by having other positive effects on health , including improving cholesterol , reducing blood glucose and insulin resistance			2

@entity16 *scientists* reviewed data from nine trials involving more than 540 *patients* and found probiotics lowered *systolic* and *diastolic* levels
those with high blood pressure saw the greatest positive effects
consuming probiotics with multiple species of bacteria worked better than those containing just a single type of bacterium
lowering blood pressure can help prevent heart disease and stroke
probiotics found in yoghurt , fermented and sour milk and cheese
