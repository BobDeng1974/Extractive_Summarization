a jeweller with a childhood dream of seeing diamonds floating in the sky has fulfilled his wish after flying a £ 1million stone above @entity7			1
@entity8 , founder of @entity9 , was inspired after spending hours gazing at stars as a boy			2
to celebrate his company 's fifth anniversary , the 53 - year - old attached the gem to a remote - controlled hexacopter - a six - bladed mini helicopter - to fly above @entity17 in west @entity7			1
the diamond let off a stunning beam of white light while being lit up as it flew above trees in @entity17 , west @entity7 on october 3 to celebrate @entity22 of @entity24 's fifth anniversary attached to the expert - controlled hexacopter , the £ 1million stone was lit up by a fixed light rig which showcased its beauty			1
mr @entity8 said he had the idea from staring at stars as a child the 10 - carat £ 1million diamond is among the exquisite jewels sold by @entity35 in @entity7			1
it was chosen for the flight as it reflected the best light the 10 - carat diamond was lit up by a fixed rig on the device , sending piercing beams of white light across the night sky			1
' the idea with the flying of a diamond was first for me a child dream while gazing at the stars and reminded with stories like the @entity54 and songs like @entity56 in the sky with diamonds , ' he said			2
' now it is a great reason to deepen my understanding on how light affects diamonds at long distance and how i could play with lights and diamonds			0
' the jeweller now hopes to put on similar displays from the @entity68 , over snow and at the in the desert to showcase the beauty of diamonds			1
' my theory was confirmed and the experience reveals the immense power of diamonds , a power that has never been seen before			0
' the quality of the light when filtered through a diamond and returned to people at floor level creates the finest light that any medium can create			2
' for me , the light with its pure white and colour flashes represent the highest level of beauty			2
it gives me the same joy as art but amplified			0
the 53 - year - old said the stunt helped him understand the stone 's capabilities with reflecting light			1
he is pictured launching the diamond into the sky on october 3 the brightness of the diamond is clearly visible as it lines up next to the moon			0
mr @entity8 said he would now like to try the stunt at the @entity68 and over snow ' i have spent a few months studying and practising the most appropriate angles to get the light fully inside the diamond with a right balance of few reflections			1
' for the first flight i wanted to show the inner beauty of diamonds			0
' once i had an effect similar to the northern lights in green colour and then in blue colour as i was walking towards the centre of the diamonds , far below			0
this is something i will also recreate later			0
' it is like walking in the sparks and brilliance of a diamond			0
