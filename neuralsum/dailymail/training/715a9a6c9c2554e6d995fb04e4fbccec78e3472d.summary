@entity0 will walk into @entity2 ’s ‘ bunker ’ on sunday , the ominous - sounding office where manager @entity4 has been plotting the downfall of @entity8 football ’s biggest name for the last six days			1
but if he wants a good glass of red wine , whatever the result , he has been warned he may have to bring his own			2
‘ there are no windows , ’ said @entity4 before a game he puts up there with the biggest in the club ’s history			1
‘ if it ’s fresh air he wants then we ’ll have to go outside			0
we ’ll go for a mediocre red , but if he wants a real top one then i ’ll be happy to share			0
’ how much they are willing to spend on a decent @entity48 is n’t the only thing that ’s a little different about these two clubs			0
@entity2 ’s weekly wage budget stands at £ 37,500 — the amount @entity23 striker @entity30 earns in a single day			1
@entity53 takes home more in a month than the minnows shell out in a year			0
not that it really bothers @entity4 , who is the epitome of pragmatism but holds that sparkle which fills this small @entity61 town with hope of an unlikely upset to match their greatest ever , against @entity65 in 1949			2
incidentally , the prize for that scalp was an 8 - 0 fifth - round drubbing by @entity23			1
@entity70 goalkeeper @entity69 ( third right ) punches clear during the 1949 victory over @entity65 @entity2 player - manager @entity73 , who scored the first goal against @entity65 in the fourth round of the @entity27 , is carried shoulder high during a dance and cabaret at the @entity79 to celebrate the victory @entity23 fan @entity81 attended the fifth round @entity27 game against @entity2 in 1949 ‘ we ’d like to keep our reputation as a good @entity27 side , ’ he added			1
‘ we ’ve told all the new lads that @entity2 were the best non-league team for @entity27 upsets for years , and that we do well when we ’re the underdogs			1
we ’re certainly the underdogs here by a million miles			0
’ they are even more up against it than when the draw was made , with @entity4 fully admitting that @entity2 have taken their eye off the ball since beating @entity93 in the second round replay			1
none more so than on monday , when they were battered 3 - 0 at home by @entity98 in a defeat which leaves them bottom of @entity102			0
@entity4 's side go into the match with @entity23 on the back of a 3 - 0 defeat by @entity98 last monday ‘ some of the players subconsciously saved themselves in that game and lost their place for @entity23			1
they will learn from that pretty quick			0
‘ if @entity36 watched us against @entity98 he ’d probably feel they could put out their under 14s against us			0
‘ hopefully the boys will go in with a different feeling , without the pressure of the points			0
now it ’s finally here we just ca n’t wait			0
’ @entity4 , who says his experience managing @entity120 stands him in good stead for games such as this , ca n’t be far off legend status in this pocket of the @entity127			2
he was the man who won promotion to the @entity129 in 2003 and then did the unthinkable by taking @entity2 to the @entity130 two years ago			2
@entity4 was not happy with some of his players ' attitudes during the defeat by @entity98 @entity4 embraces @entity2 captain @entity134 after the second round win @entity136 in december @entity102 @entity2 stand to pocket £ 221,000 from the third round tie with @entity23			1
the @entity27 dish out £ 27,000 in prize money for a second - round victory , plus the club will earn a further £ 144,000 from @entity142 , who will broadcast the third round tie live			1
@entity2 are set to earn in the region of £ 50,000 in gate receipts with the @entity23 tie sold out at @entity2 ’s 9,565 - seater stadium			1
@entity2 could be set to earn a staggering £ 1.5m from the third round tie if they force a replay at old @entity151			2
‘ if we win they might even put a statue up of me , ’ he laughed			0
‘ i reckon i ’ve earned one already , but the chairman says i ’ve got to do a little bit more yet			0
i ’m only 5ft 7in so it would n’t take a lot of metal , would it ? ’ @entity4 ’s side are going to have to show more than a bit of mettle if they want to inflict anything worse than a cheap bottle of wine on @entity169			1
however , when the two teams walk out of the @entity25 tunnel there will be one among them wearing a @entity23 shirt under his @entity70 kit			2
ten - year - old @entity176 , a @entity23 fan , was handed a late @entity178 present by his father , @entity2 striker @entity179 , when he was told he had got him a place as a home mascot for the game			1
@entity2 striker @entity179 's @entity23 - supporting son will be a mascot for the tie @entity179 celebrates after scoring in the @entity27 third round exactly one year before the @entity23 clash the fixture is one of the biggest in @entity2 ’s history and @entity179 admits , at 35 years old , that it will be the greatest in his long career as a forward			1
but there was one in the @entity179 household who celebrated even more than him when @entity169 ’s team were pulled out of the hat			2
‘ @entity176 said he wants to wear his @entity23 kit under his @entity2 kit , ’ @entity179 explained			1
‘ he was buzzing about the draw			0
i only told him on tuesday he was going to get to be a mascot as well			0
so it ’s even better he ’s going to get to shake hands with all the players			0
he just ca n’t wait for the game			0
’ @entity179 ’s wife and their two daughters will be at the game , too , although his parents , @entity211 and @entity212 , are unable to attend			2
they famously missed the moment their son scored the fastest hat - trick in @entity129 history in 2004			0
@entity179 , playing for @entity217 at the time , arrived from the bench in the 84th minute to score three times in just 140 seconds			2
but his parents had left the ground early to catch a ferry back to their home in the @entity225			0
@entity179 is congratulated by his team - mates after his third round goal against @entity98 in 2014 @entity4 will be hoping for more third - round heroics from the @entity2 front man on sunday ‘ they were listening to the radio on the way back , ’ @entity179 said			1
‘ they were obviously pleased , but they ’d left to get the earlier ferry			0
they still shake their heads about it			0
’ his father is too unwell to travel to the match on sunday , but both parents will be watching back home on television , eager not to miss this one			2
@entity179 spent a large part of his career at @entity217 , raised on stories of them knocking @entity23 out of the @entity27 in 1984 when @entity249 was in charge			1
@entity2 ’s giant - killing exploits are even more legendary and an unlikely victory for the @entity102 team against this @entity23 side , worth hundreds of millions of pounds , will perhaps mark their greatest moment of all			1
everyone in a @entity2 shirt will be celebrating wildly if they can pull it off , apart from one young boy with his @entity23 kit on underneath .			1

@entity23 travel to @entity2 in the @entity27 third round on sunday
@entity4 warns @entity0 he *'ll* have to bring his own wine if he wants an expensive bottle after the game
@entity30 earns in one day what @entity2 pay out in weekly wages
@entity4 joked he may have a statue erected if his side pull off *giantkilling*
@entity2 striker @entity179 's son is a @entity23 fan and will be a mascot
@entity280 , 10 , wants to wear a @entity23 kit under the @entity2 strip
