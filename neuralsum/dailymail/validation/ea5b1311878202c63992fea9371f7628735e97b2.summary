a small town in @entity1 stands divided after their high school 's decision on wednesday to broadcast the @entity5 in @entity6			1
it was meant as a way to celebrate @entity12 -- each day , the announcements and pledge at @entity9 would be recited in a different tongue			1
however , the outrage it caused in some students and parents quickly forced administrators to issue an apology and a promise to henceforth only recite the @entity5 in @entity21			1
now , lines have been drawn in @entity23 ( pop. 1,600 ) as some students and teachers are outraged that an apology was issued at all while others applaud the decision and say the pledge should never have been recited in a language other than @entity21			1
' ' something that was supposed to be good but turned out not to be , ' @entity37 admitted			2
the attempt at teaching a lesson in multiculturalism caused a backlash almost immediately			2

' by wednesday afternoon , principal @entity53 had apologized in a schoolwide announcement			0
the school would also soon post an apology to its website			0
' the intention was to promote the fact that those who speak a language other than @entity21 still pledge to salute this great country , ' the statement read			1
' we sincerely apologize to any / students , staff or community members who found this activity offensive			1
in our school @entity69 will only be recited in @entity21 as recommended by the @entity71			1

' i knew exactly what would happen , ' he told the @entity38			0
' i knew many would n't support it			0
' that includes many of the student politician 's constituents at @entity23			0
' here 's my issue			0
you made the decision to turn the school against itself , a move you knew would make @entity23 look bad , ' student @entity96 tweeted to @entity48			0
student @entity101 also opposed the recitation			0
' it 's the @entity5 , we 're saying it to the @entity106 flag			0
i think it should be said in @entity21			2
it is foreign language week but we do n't even offer @entity6 in @entity9 , ' he said			1
others supported @entity48 's decision and were appalled by the backlash , like senior @entity114 , who tweeted : ' " i go to @entity23 bush but i 'm not racist " * me introducing myself to new people * ' despite all the controversy , @entity48 wo n't apologize for his decision to read the pledge in @entity6			1
