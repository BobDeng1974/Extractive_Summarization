@entity1 boss @entity0 says he feels sorry for @entity3 loanee @entity2 , but admits he should never have been signed by the @entity5 club			1
@entity9 - born @entity8 youth cap @entity6 has yet to feature for the @entity10 after being diagnosed with a mystery illness			1
he was one of five @entity13 youngsters signed by former @entity10 chief executive @entity14 without being put through a medical - even though @entity6 knew he was sick before signing for the @entity16 giants			1
@entity2 has not played for @entity1 since his loan move from @entity3 the 21 - year - old has denied rumours claiming he is suffering from @entity20 , but @entity22 boss @entity0 confirmed his condition means he will not be able to feature for his adopted club			1
the former @entity26 manager would love to have the use of the former @entity30 midfielder 's services , but believes he should never have been allowed to make the move north in the first place			2
' @entity33 has got a medical condition which is a personal matter , ' said @entity0			1
' the doctor and consultant are all involved in that			2
' i knew him at @entity30			2
i remember watching him and thought when i came into the job he will be a good one to bring in and give us a bit of energy			0
unfortunately because of his medical condition he wo n't be able to play for us			2
@entity6 signed on loan for @entity1 alongside @entity46 ( middle ) and @entity48 ' but that is as big a blow to the kid as it is for us			1
it 's not his fault , this [ row ] has been nothing to do with him			0
he comes in with a smile on his face each morning , he trains with the fitness coach as hard as he possibly can			0
' so as disappointed as we are that we ca n't use him , you have to think of the boy in this matter because he ca n't go back , he ca n't play for anyone else			2
' it 's an unfortunate circumstance that really should never have happened			0
' @entity14 - a close associate of @entity13 owner @entity69 - signed off on the five @entity3 loan deals just hours before the january transfer window shut , but did not ask club doctors to check the players over			1
so far only @entity74 playmaker @entity46 has played regularly			0
@entity2 says he knew he was ill before he moved to @entity1 defender @entity48 limped off just half an hour into his debut and has not been seen since , while @entity77 winger @entity76 has yet to even step foot inside @entity79 after being ruled out for the rest of the season with a serious knee injury			1
@entity84 defender @entity83 has featured for @entity1 ' youth side but is ' nowhere ' near being fit enough for first - team duty , according to @entity0			1
the @entity22 boss cans sympathise with the players but hit out at the previous regime 's decision to sanction some of the signings			0
@entity1 boss @entity0 says he feels sorry for @entity3 loanee @entity6 @entity0 said : ' should these guys ever have been sent here ? well , with @entity33 being unable to play that 's a no - brainer			1
with @entity76 , he was on his way back but had a little setback			0
' but i think if you look at it in all honesty , anybody who comes up for a six - month loan should have a medical - obviously that is not the case			2
' if that had occurred , two or three of the loans may not have happened			0
' but none of the players are at fault here			0
@entity76 has not been up but the rest come in and train as hard as they can			0
they are doing their utmost to be involved			0
