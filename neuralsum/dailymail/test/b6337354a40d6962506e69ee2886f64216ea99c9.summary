whether or not a person suffers hearing loss due to loud noise may depend on their genes , research suggests			2
noise - induced hearing loss is one of the most common work - related illnesses and members of the armed forces are particularly vulnerable			1
in 2013 , the @entity12 @entity11 reported hearing loss as one of the most common ailments among veterans receiving disability compensation			2
noise - induced hearing loss is one of the most common work - related illnesses , doctors have warned now , however , scientists at the @entity23 believe they have made a breakthrough in their understanding of the condition			1
they have identified a gene , named @entity28 , found in the inner ear , that is crucial in determining how vulnerable a person is to developing hearing loss			1
their research , looking at the dna of mice exposed to noise , is the first published genome - wide association study on noise - induced hearing loss in mice			1
as a result of the findings , those at higher , genetic risk for hearing loss can decide whether to take precautionary measures to protect their hearing prior to hazardous noise exposure , the study authors say			2
' understanding the biological processes that affect susceptibility to hearing loss due to loud noise exposure is an important factor in reducing the risk , ' said lead study author professor @entity55			0
' we have made great advances in hearing restoration , but nothing can compare to protecting the hearing you have and preventing hearing loss in the first place			0
' scientists have identified a gene , named @entity28 , found in the inner ear , that is crucial in determining how vulnerable a person is to developing hearing loss while some gene association studies on noise - induced hearing loss in people have been conducted in the past , all were very small and their results unreplicated			1
genome wide association studies search the entire dna for common mutations to see if any of those are linked with a trait			0
mouse genome wide association studies have lead to the discovery of hundreds of genes involved in complex traits that have immediate relevance to people			0
the study was published in the journal @entity88			0
an earlier version of this piece existed but has now been amended .			0

research was conducted at the @entity23
scientists there have identified a gene , named @entity28 , found in the inner ear
say this is crucial in determining a person *'s* vulnerability to hearing loss
noise - induced hearing loss is most common work - related illness in the @entity12
