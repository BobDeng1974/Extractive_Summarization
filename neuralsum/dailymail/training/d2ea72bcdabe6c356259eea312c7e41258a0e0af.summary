by @entity0 published : 04:10 est , 9 august 2012 updated : 18:57 est , 9 august 2012 shattered : @entity1 just misses out on @entity3 glory what a splendid day for a dip in the lake			1
the sun was shining and the water was warm			1
a perfect setting , it seemed , for double world champion @entity8 to win an @entity3 medal in the @entity12			1
but despite the roars of the crowd , and a formidable turnout by her mates from @entity17 , she just could n’t manage to refloat @entity19 ’s swimming pride			1
the 24 - year - old from @entity21 came fourth in the gruelling ten - kilometre event , crossing the line just four tenths of a second away from bronze after a race lasting nearly two hours			1
the girl did her best			1
and from what she was saying afterwards about being caught in a scrum which swam only inches apart for much of the course , this was n’t exactly sports day at @entity35			1
‘ it was a little bit violent , ’ she said with a smile			2
‘ it seemed to be a pretty tough , violent race from the start			2
i ’m not really a fighter – i ’m more of a lover i guess			2
‘ i struggled in the pack with all the fighting that happened and i got hit quite a few times in the face			2
i tried to deal with it as best i could but it just took a lot more energy out of me than i was expecting			2
’ her failure to gain a medal after being tipped for success mirrors a disappointing olympics for our swimmers , all of whom were trying to cheer her to victory yesterday from the sideline			1
every time she swam past , they jumped , wriggled , shimmied and cheered her on			2
sir @entity66 joined @entity1 ’s bridesmaid - to - be @entity67 in the throng , as did her fiancé and team - mate @entity70			2
before the race @entity1 found time to text @entity70 to remind him to put some sun - screen on			2
they are getting married in @entity74 next month and a panda - eye suntan for the wedding photos would be a definite no - no. perhaps in anticipation , the official @entity3 factsheet already has him listed as her husband			2
@entity1 said later that she was caught off guard by the fast pace of the race , which , incidentally , she normally sets			0
heartache : @entity85 finishes fourth , just seconds behind her rivals in the 10km swimming marathon in @entity88 today @entity19 's @entity85 ( foreground ) leads the field away from the start pontoon in the @entity12 , @entity88 members of the @entity19 swimming team lend their support to @entity8 from the banks of the @entity12 but she also admitted making a mistake when she stopped off at the feeding station on the third lap. in open water races , swimmers tuck gel packs into their suits and are handed drinks on long sticks as they go by the feeding areas , usually flipping over on their backs , like an otter , to take a few sips before flipping the bottles away			1
but at one point she dropped the bottle			0
tv cameras caught the green liquid spewing into the water			1
this is a tough race , and not just because of the pain and endurance involved			0
there are other potential difficulties , too			0
in the 2007 world championship in @entity122 @entity1 was stung in the mouth by a jellyfish			0
swimming in a @entity126 river before the @entity127 , she found herself competing against floating dead dogs			0
and the 282 - year - old @entity12 did n’t meet with universal approval			0
one swimmer inspecting the water described it as ‘ murky ’			1
@entity134 broadcasters delighted in telling folks back home that the 28 acres of water was widely known as the @entity138 , despite strenuous efforts to clean it			1
furthermore , @entity17 performance manager @entity142 ’s assertion that the royal swans had been rounded up and sent to a holiday camp for the day with their families proved not to be the case			0
@entity8 was just unable to keep up with the race leader , @entity148 of @entity149 , and ultimately finished fourth in an exciting finish @entity8 ( right , number 15 ) tussles with @entity152 of @entity153 during the 10km open water swim five minutes before the athletes walked on , 11 of the blighters glided by for a peek at the start line			1
they got a big cheer when they tried to return but were herded up and driven off by @entity162 cowboys in kayaks			0
by the time the race was an hour old , @entity1 was among nine swimmers who had started to put a gap between themselves and their increasingly flagging opponents			0
and on the last turn , with 1,000 aching , tortuous , exhausting metres still to go , the front four began to create a vast space of clear water behind them			1
@entity1 ’s tank was clearly running low			0
still , however , she refused to give up			0
in the end , fractions of a second counted for everything			0
little wonder she looked exhausted afterwards			0
touchingly , however , the first thing she did when she pulled herself out of the water was to take a deep bow towards each side of the lake , where thousands of spectators had loyally cheered every stroke of the way			1
the swimmer is handed a drink on the end of a stick by her coach during the race ‘ @entity193 in the world is not too bad but not really what i wanted , ’ she said rather glumly afterwards			0
her fiance said : ‘ yes , it was disappointing but the thing is i ’m going to be getting married to her , so i ’m just so very proud of her , and to see her smiling all the way through the interviews as well has made me feel a lot better			0
’ @entity67 tweeted : ‘ absolutely so proud of @ @entity204 ca n’t believe i get to call her a friend ! ’ she gushed			0
‘ she ’s amazing ! 4th in the world at such a tough event ! ! ’ all true , all very flattering			1
but @entity17 swimmers know they ’ll have to do better than this to safeguard the future of the sport ’s £ 25.1million annual funding			0
