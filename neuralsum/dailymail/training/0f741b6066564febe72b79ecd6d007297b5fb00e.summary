by @entity0 and @entity1 auditors have warned that @entity4 ¿ s flagship welfare reform has got off to a disastrous start and should be delayed to prevent further losses to the taxpayer @entity4 today sought to pin the blame for the disastrous start of his flagship welfare reforms on inept civil servants			0
the @entity12 said he ' lost faith ' in his own civil servants running the huge @entity16 project			1
he accused them of ' just wanting to be able to say it was going well ' even as the £ 2.4billion project hit problems			2
in a devastating report the @entity21 says @entity16 is beset by ‘ weak management , ineffective control and poor governance ’			1
the scheme , which will replace a string of out - of - work benefits , is designed to ensure that it always pays people to take a job or work more hours			1
but auditors warn that the £ 2.4billion project has ‘ not achieved value for money ’ , partly because of unrealistic timetables imposed by ministers			1
a £ 425million it system is still not working properly and £ 34million of equipment has already been written off			0
the @entity21 says the scheme ‘ still has the potential to create significant benefits for society ’			1
but it suggests the deadline for rolling out the scheme by 2017 may have to be put back , adding that the @entity50 ‘ must scale back its delivery ambition and set out realistic plans ’			1
the findings are a major blow to mr @entity4 , who has staked his reputation on delivering the complex project on time			0
the minister is expected to be called to @entity57 today to answer questions from @entity59 about why he repeatedly told the @entity61 the project was on track while knowing it was at risk of collapse			0
but mr @entity4 today claimed he could have written the report himself			0
he told the @entity67 : ' i lost faith in the ability of the civil servants to be able to manage this programme			0
' so we brought in people from outside , we brought in the @entity75 , working with my colleagues , to ensure that this programme could be delivered within the scope of how it was planned and make sure that it was delivered within budget – not going back to the @entity82 for any more money			1
' he added that the officials ' charged with putting in place the it did n't make the correct decisions '			0
having invested in the wrong systems , there was then a refusal to admit there was a problem , he added			0
' there was a sense that somehow they just wanted to be able to say it was all going well , ' mr @entity4 said			0
they pointed to warnings in today ’s report that some of those working on the project had developed a ‘ fortress mentality ’ and ‘ a ' good news ' reporting culture ’ , leaving ministers in the dark about any problems			2
but @entity110 will demand that mr @entity4 comes to the @entity61 to explain why the project has gone so badly off course			0
the scheme , which will replace a string of out - of - work benefits , is designed to ensure that it always pays people to take a job or work more hours he is likely to be asked why he continued to issue public assurances that the scheme was on track when senior officials across @entity123 were privately warning him of ‘ serious concerns ’			1
in a withering assessment , today ’s report says : ‘ throughout the programme the @entity50 has lacked a detailed view of how @entity16 is meant to work			2
‘ the department was warned repeatedly about the lack of a detailed “ blueprint ” … for @entity16			2
’ it adds : ‘ the department has delayed rolling out @entity16 to claimants , has had weak control of the programme , and has been unable to assess the value of the systems it spent over £ 300million to develop			1
’ the @entity21 raises wider concerns about the department ’s ability to ‘ deal with weak programme management , over-optimistic timescales and a lack of openness about progress ’			1
it also says @entity16 ’s it system ‘ lacks a component to identify potentially fraudulent claims ’			1
@entity149 , @entity110 ’s work and pensions spokesman said : ‘ mr @entity4 swore blind this benefit shake - up was fine			0
now we learn he has completely lost control of his department at a potential cost of hundreds of millions of pounds			0
’ a @entity50 spokesman said the report did not cover ‘ significant ’ progress made since april when a former @entity161 chief was brought in to ‘ reset ’ the project .			2
