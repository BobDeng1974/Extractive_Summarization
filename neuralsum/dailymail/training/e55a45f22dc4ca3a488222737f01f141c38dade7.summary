by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity2 was accused of ‘ clutching at straws ’ last night , as he claimed the squeeze on living standards will continue until 2020			2
the @entity7 leader dismissed mounting evidence of a sustained economic recovery and suggested millions on middle incomes will continue to suffer for years			1
party sources said mr @entity2 will use a speech in @entity13 today to ‘ ridicule ’ @entity14 claims that the economy is on the mend			2
labour leader @entity2 claimed middle class families were not enjoying the benefits of a return to growth @entity23 last night accused mr @entity2 of desperation			1
the deputy prime minister said : ‘ @entity2 is clutching at straws and now he ’s down to his last one			0
instead of making specious claims , the @entity7 should take responsibility for the past			1
’ mr @entity2 cited forecasts from the @entity31 suggesting average earnings will lag behind economic growth until at least 2018			0
he said the cost - of - living crisis ‘ will continue for the five years of the next @entity34 ’ unless action is taken to ensure the rewards of economic growth are spread more evenly			1
official figures show the economy grew by 0.7 per cent in the last three months of 2013 , the fourth quarter of growth in a row middle class families weathered the recession by shopping in cheaper supermarkets , using grandparents for free childcare and taking on extra jobs , a report published today reveals			1
households in the social group became ‘ very good ’ at adapting their spending and employment in order to ride out the crisis , says research by a think - tank			1
some even managed to move into a higher income bracket despite the economic downturn , the @entity59 said			0
more women went out to work as families sought to make ends meet , with the proportion of double - income households rising from 35 per cent to 49 per cent			2
an analysis of household income also found that the middle classes became bargain seekers , switching stores and hunting out cheaper deals to avoid the 25 per cent increase in food prices			1
and there was also a dramatic rise in the number of people using the generosity of grandparents and other relatives to help with childcare to cut the cost of a childminder or nursery			2
middle earners are now using 20 per cent more ‘ free ’ care for the under - twos than they were in 2007 , says the report			1
around one in five families deemed middle income in 2008 – with a net income of between £ 26,100 and £ 41,200 – fell down the income scale as a result of the financial crisis			1
but two - fifths stayed where they were , and the remaining two - fifths have since climbed into the higher brackets			0
‘ the middle class – once the solid centre of our economy – is being hollowed out , with growing insecurity and the prospect , for the first time since the war , that their children will be worse off than they were , ’ he added			0
mr @entity2 will today call for local councils to be placed in charge of drawing up their own economic plans			0
he will pledge to give cities powers over £ 20billion of housing , transport and skills funding to help close the productivity gap between the capital and other parts of the country			0
‘ we need a prosperous @entity122 , but we also need to build prosperity outside it , ’ he will say			0
‘ today , every region outside @entity122 is below the national average when it comes to productivity , while @entity122 is 40 per cent above it			0
‘ @entity129 will never tackle the cost - of - living crisis … unless we break this pattern and reverse a century of centralisation			1
’ but mr @entity2 ’s wider argument on the economy was undermined by a @entity59 report yesterday which revealed that most middle - class families have weathered the recession well			1
around a fifth of families classed as having a middle income in 2008 – those with net earnings of between £ 26,000 and £ 41,200 – slipped down the income scale as a result of the financial crisis			1
but two - fifths have stayed where they were and a further two - fifths have moved up to a higher income group			0
@entity150 , director of the @entity59 , said : ‘ in reality , the middle has coped surprisingly well since 2007 - 8			2
’ in a further blow to @entity7 ’s analysis , a report by accountants @entity157 today shows that starting salaries are rising at their fastest rate since 2007			1
mr @entity23 said the @entity7 leadership had ‘ spent the last four years praying that the recovery would not materialise ’			2
he added : ‘ for a long time they insisted that the @entity164 ’s action to tackle the deficit would choke off growth			0
‘ @entity167 – the deficit has been eliminated by a third and growth is back			0
then they claimed unemployment would rise by a million			0
wrong – unemployment is coming down and we are seeing record numbers of people in work			0

@entity7 leader steps up attack on *government* despite *brighter* outlook
claims millions are ' caught in the *crosshairs* of cost of living crisis '
report reveals how middle classes survived - and thrived - in recession
