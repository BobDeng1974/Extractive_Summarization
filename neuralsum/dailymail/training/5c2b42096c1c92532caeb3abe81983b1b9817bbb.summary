by @entity0 every parent should be issued with a ten - point checklist of skills that their children must master before their first day at school , the head of @entity2 said yesterday			1
sir @entity9 warned that too many youngsters have been starting their education unable to use the toilet , follow simple instructions or even make themselves understood			1
launching @entity2 ’s first report into early - years education , he said that while many parents ‘ intuitively ’ teach children vital skills , others fail to do so , condemning their offspring to struggle at school			1
sir @entity9 warned that too many youngsters have been starting their education unable to use the toilet , follow simple instructions or even make themselves understood ( stock picture ) and he claimed that a list of ‘ essential skills ’ – such as sitting still , listening and understanding the words ‘ no ’ and ‘ stop ’ – would help parents ensure their children were equipped to start primary school classes			1
he also demanded more places for two - year - olds at school - based nurseries , particularly for poorer youngsters , to help them catch up with their wealthier peers			1
addressing childcare professionals in @entity36 , sir @entity9 revealed that across the country , only a third of youngsters from low - income backgrounds reach key development milestones by the age of five			2
he said : ‘ the poorest children are less likely to be able to follow instructions , make themselves understood or manage their own basic hygiene			0
‘ by age five , many children have started reading simple words , talking in sentences and can add single numbers			0
but far fewer of the poorest children can			0
’ sir @entity9 went on to attack the ‘ middle - class ’ idea that structured learning is damaging for young children			1
he criticised the ‘ chattering classes ’ who believe children should be free to enjoy themselves without being required to learn			0
‘ let us not pander to those who think childhoods are being stolen , ’ he said , adding : ‘ it is a middle class prejudice for which some of the most disadvantaged pay the price			0
’ but early years consultant @entity65 told sir @entity9 : ‘ there is a lot of evidence about what counts in children ’s later success and it is not putting on your shoes and going to the toilet , or even being able to recognise your name			2
‘ it is things like being confident , being curious and motivated			0
' we need to be careful when we look at what are we saying are the essential things to be ready for school but also to be life - long learners			2

sir @entity9 said too many children start education *unprepared*
said some skills are ' intuitively taught ' whereas some parents fail to do so
also demanded more places for two - year - olds at school - based nurseries
