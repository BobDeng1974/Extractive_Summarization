by @entity0 published : 06:01 est , 28 october 2013 updated : 06:21 est , 28 october 2013 an aspiring wildlife photographer has put together an astonishing collection of photographs which reveal the close similarities between humans and primates			1
@entity7 , 22 , took the pictures on a visit to his local zoo in @entity11 , @entity12			1
@entity7 , who was born in @entity13 , began the project as an investigation into anthropomorphism , the tendency to find human traits in animals			1
but after spending the last year in such close proximity to the animals , he has forged some close friendships			2
twenty - two - year - old @entity7 , an aspiring wildlife photographer , captured the animals at his local zoo in @entity11 , @entity12 the former psychology student said he started the project as an investigation into anthropomorphism in which animals display human traits such as emotion @entity7 's close up images of orangutans @entity31 ( left ) and @entity32 ( right ) reveal their facial expressions are perhaps more human - like than expected two of the animals with which he has developed strong bonds are 28 - year - old orangutan @entity31 and his two - year - old son , @entity36			1
' it 's amazing really , ' said @entity7			2
' i started this project to see how people attribute their own personality in these animals , only to find they are sometimes better at expressing their emotions than we are			0
' that , i think , is what has been the most fascinating part of this whole experience - really coming to understand these animals do in fact have individual personalities and traits			2
' their body language and reactions to various stimuli , if paid attention to , really defines each one as a unique individual			0
' however , despite their growing connection , the photographer is all - too - aware that the gap between him and the animals can never be fully overcome			2
' i am absolutely fascinated with my growing relationship with each individual , but i also realise that there will always be a barrier between us , and one not made of reinforced glass and metal bars , ' @entity7 added			0
' i would give anything to have a conversation with them , to truly understand how they think and feel and cope with a life so estranged from nature			0
' after spending significant amounts of time with the animals however @entity7 began to develop strong bonds , like with @entity36 , the two - year - old orangutan ' they are sometimes better at expressing emotions than we are ' said @entity82 upon reflection of the project which he has been working on over the past year posing primates : aspiring photographer @entity7 said he would love to be able to have a conversation with the animals to truly know what they were feeling two of the animals with which @entity7 bonded were orangutans , two - year - old @entity36 , pictured here resting , and his 28 - year - old father @entity31 28 - year - old orangutan @entity31 ( left ) stares down the camera 's lens as @entity32 , a female orangutan ( right ) sits quietly at the zoo after being diagnosed with chronic cluster headaches , @entity7 gave up his psychology course at the @entity99 to purse his passion for photography			1
born in @entity102 , @entity13 , where his father was stationed in the @entity104 , he has dreams of becoming a wildlife photographer			1
' living in the city in @entity109 , i 'm not exactly close to any rainforests , my wildlife experience is usually limited to the unlucky deer on the side of the road , ' he said			0
' the zoo is a place where i can escape for a few hours and , if only for a moment , live my dream '			0
@entity7 is hopeful his images of captive primates will help animal conservation efforts			1
' the palm oil industry is wiping their habitat off the face of the earth , and it hurts me to think that in a generation or two , someone with a dream similar to mine will have no choice but to photograph these amazing animals behind glass and brick , ' said the photographer			0
' i would give anything to be able to photograph them in the wild someday , and it scares me that i may never have that opportunity			0
' @entity32 the female orangutan peers out from beneath a sheet at the zoo			0
@entity7 is hopeful his project will help raise awareness for animal conservation initiatives a @entity144 's tamarin sticks its tongue out while another stares angrily to the ground			2
@entity7 decided to put the collection together after being diagnosed with cluster headaches and dropping out of a psychology course @entity7 is grateful for the local zoo which allows him a rare glimpse into animals ' emotions as , living in the city , he can not see them in their natural habitat			1

@entity7 began project as an investigation into animals displaying human traits
the 22 - year - old captured human - like facial expressions of primates at local zoo
