@entity0 has confirmed that the start of this year ’s @entity2 on june 6 will be pushed back by half an hour in an effort to halt the alarming slump in viewing figures			1
the plan for a 4.30pm fifth - race slot with the meeting also starting at the later time of 2pm was revealed by @entity10 in october amid speculation that the track and sponsors were even considering an evening start for the biggest flat race of the @entity17 season			1
@entity18 ridden by @entity19 wins the @entity2 at @entity0 in june last year such a move was not an option this summer with the @entity23 final also rostered for june 6			1
the need for @entity26 approval with attendance of the @entity28 being regarded as crucial plus the potential of spiralling police costs are likely to have been other factors for that idea being parked , at least for time being			0
but @entity0 supremo @entity34 made it clear that an evening @entity2 has not completely been removed from the agenda when he said : ’ at this stage this is the extent of our changes to race times but we will review following the 2015 @entity42			2
’ @entity28 and prince @entity43 on the @entity44 at the @entity45 last summer that will heap the pressure on @entity48 and @entity49 , their new @entity50 , whose appointment was announced on wednesday			1
@entity49 , currently @entity52 of @entity54 @entity53 on @entity55 , is faced with 2014 figures showing year - on - year falls in peak audience ( 1.55million compared to 1.95m ) , audience share ( 14.7 per cent compared to 21.8 per cent ) and average audience ( 770,000 compared to 834,000 )			2
with an half - hour later start time hardly have a seismic effect , the emphasis will be on @entity48 to draw in viewers with the sort of promotional push they have previously concentrated on the @entity65			2
@entity66 will hope to retain their @entity23 title in the final which is scheduled for june 6 the @entity69 is set to move the race start times to try and boost falling tv audience figures that meeting looks like it has lost another big name with news that @entity78 ’s @entity77 winner more of that broke a blood vessel during a piece of work under @entity83 on wednesday morning			1
@entity84 described the gelding ’s participation at the @entity42 as ‘ unlikely ’			0
more of that had been expected to be one of @entity83 ’s best chances at his last @entity42			0

@entity102 have suspended betting on the race			0
@entity84 and @entity83 , successful with @entity104 at @entity105 , will be hoping for better news when @entity108 contender @entity107 tries put a couple of tame efforts behind him in the @entity112 at @entity113 on thursday			0
