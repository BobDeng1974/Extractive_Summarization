@entity0 ( left ) is set for disciplinary action after arriving late for the match against @entity5 @entity1 forward @entity0 battles for the ball with @entity5 midfielder @entity17 ( right ) ‘ everybody can be late one day in the morning , but you ca n’t be late at 1pm when you have to play against @entity5			1
‘ his explanation is between him and me , but he was too late			2
i ca n’t and i do n’t accept that			2
if he has to pay a fine , he pays the fine			2
‘ but the best way to keep the discipline in the team was not to pick him today			2
’ on a day of frustration for @entity3 , the @entity1 boss felt his side were denied a penalty when @entity31 blatantly tripped @entity32 in the first half			1
@entity1 had two other penalty shouts , when @entity32 fell under pressure from @entity37 in the first minute and @entity36 appeared to handle in the box			1
‘ the first situation is difficult because , if you whistle , it ’s a penalty and a red card , ’ said @entity3			1
@entity32 is challenged by @entity5 midfielder @entity31 ( bottom ) and @entity43 ( top ) @entity1 boss @entity3 believes that his side were denied a penalty against @entity5 @entity47 's graphic of @entity17 's thunderbolt to give @entity5 the lead ‘ you have to be sure as a referee to do that			1
maybe @entity32 in that moment fell down a bit too easily in the box			2
‘ the second , there ’s no question			2
i do n’t understand the referee there			2
but ok , humans make mistakes			2
the handball just before half - time ? i do n’t know			1
' i have to watch it back , but it ’s always difficult with handballs and penalties			0
‘ i am proud of how we played but in the last few games we have struggled to score and then it ’s hard to win games			0
‘ that ’s football , maybe a little bit about the confidence of the players , but the way we played today , the organisation			0
( i am ) disappointed about the result but not about the performance			0
’ @entity83 ( left ) was booed on his return to former side @entity1 for current employers @entity5 the midfielder skippered the team during his final two years of his @entity1 career @entity5 manager @entity89 said he had been shocked at the reception @entity91 skipper @entity83 was given on his return to @entity94 ’s			1
the midfielder , who spent 14 years at @entity1 , left for @entity5 last summer and was roundly booed by home fans — as was @entity36 , who also left at the end of last season			1
striker @entity99 , an unused @entity5 substitute , was given a better reception			1
and @entity89 said : ‘ today was always going to be difficult for the likes of @entity36 and @entity83			0
‘ i was a bit disappointed for @entity83			0
he was captain here for two years , gave incredible service and could have left a number of times and did n’t			0
' to get the reception he did was disappointing			0
there was nothing in the match programme referencing his time here			1
‘ no mention for @entity99 as well			0
those two guys gave their heart and soul to @entity1 and were big supporters of this club			1
' they ’ve moved to one of the biggest clubs in the world			0
those two guys were wonderful servants			0
‘ it was a massive decision for them to come to @entity5			1
for former servants or players , there ’s always appreciation			0
‘ for me , that ’s a wee bit sad			0
i was thinking of them today looking at the programme before the game			0
‘ everything they gave to this club to get them here today , and not a mention			0
’ in fact , @entity83 and @entity99 were referenced more than 20 times in the programme			0
@entity89 had a different view on @entity1 ’s penalty appeals , saying : ‘ sometimes you get them , sometimes you do n’t			1
‘ i thought the referee was excellent , but obviously with the pressure he was under from the crowd , especially with them being 1 - 0 behind , they ’re big decisions for him			1
i thought in the main he got them right			0
‘ it was an outstanding win for us , very controlled			0
of course you have to defend at times , particularly away from home against a very good side , but it ’s a wonderful win			1
