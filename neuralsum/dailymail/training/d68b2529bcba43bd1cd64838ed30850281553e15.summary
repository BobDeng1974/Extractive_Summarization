by @entity0 the @entity1 are now endorsing so called restorative therapy to ' cure ' homosexuality			0
at their annual conference in @entity6 on saturday , the party adopted the policy , which tea party groups had advocated			1
one particularly influential group , the @entity9 , had urged the party to support the psychological treatments , which claim to try and turn homosexuals straight			0
but before 7,000 delegates , the party agreed to adopt the platform which states they recognise ' the legitimacy and efficacy of counselling which offers reparative therapy and treatment for those patients seeking healing and wholeness from their homosexual lifestyle			1
' president of the conservative group , @entity36 values @entity34 welcomed the decision saying it comes as no surprise			1
treatments for ' curing ' homosexuality claim to change a person 's sexuality through techniques such as electric shock therapy , inducing nausea while being exposed to homoerotic material , praying , exorcism , trips to brothels to have sex with women , and hypnosis			1
some advocates of the therapy have also asserted that prayer and religious faith can be helpful in suppressing or overcoming same - sex attractions			2
the @entity59 have warned that the therapies run the risk of causing serious psychological harm			0
gay rights groups agree saying the therapy damages young people , because it tells them that it 's not acceptable to be whoever they are			1
the largest christian ministry engaged in such work , @entity70 , also closed last year and its leader apologised to the gay community for inflicting ' years of undue suffering			0
' @entity75 and @entity76 have both passed laws barring licensed therapists from trying to turn gay youth straight , and both laws have been upheld in court			0
he explained : ' the platform reflects what the people in the @entity84 have asked for , and that should be no surprise : family values , protection of marriage between one man and one woman and everything that goes along with that			2
' but adopting the policy has sparked controversy even amongst members of the @entity1 , some of whom had been lined up to speak out against endorsing such therapy			1
they never got the chance to address delegates , because a parliamentary motion to approve the full platform was called first			0
@entity103 , vice president of the gay conservative group @entity104 , who was due to speak said : ' there 's a very , very small group of people who want to keep the party in the past			1
we were here today to try to pull the party into the future			0
' the only way the party can go into the future is to start listening to young people , to start listening to people who have gay family members			2
' reparative therapy or conversion therapy , uses a number of techniques to try and change a person 's sexual orientation or lessen their interest in engaging in same - sex sexual activity			1
the @entity59 and other major health organizations have condemned the counselling , with other groups saying the practice should not be used on minors because of the danger of serious psychological harm			0
some of the delegates who attended the convention cheer after the speech of governor @entity138 one particularly influential group , the @entity9 , had urged the @entity36 @entity84 to support the psychological treatments @entity75 and @entity76 have both passed laws barring licensed therapists from trying to turn gay youths straight , and both laws have been upheld in court			2
@entity76 governor @entity147 , a @entity84 , signed the ban in his state against the wishes of some conservatives , saying the health risks entailed in trying to change a child 's sexual orientation overrode concerns about parental choice			0
however , @entity158 conservatives did come away with a rare victory at the convention , winning the removal of decades - old language in the state party platform that states , ' homosexuality tears at the fabric of society			2
