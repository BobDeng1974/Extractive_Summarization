by @entity0 @entity1 : 09:15 est , 20 december 2013 @entity2 : 09:19 est , 20 december 2013 a 12 - year - old boy who received a kidney from a stranger has met the man who transformed his life			1
@entity8 is the first person at @entity9 in @entity10 to receive a kidney from an altruistic living donor			1
most living donors are family members but , on occasion , strangers will offer up their kidneys to help save other people ’s lives			0
@entity8 , 12 , received a new kidney from @entity20 after he suffered kidney failure caused by a rare kidney disease			1
the pair have just met for the first time since the operation which was carried out in 2011 @entity8 met his donor , @entity20 , a 53 - year - old gp from @entity28 , after the pair exchanged letters through their transplant co-ordinators			1
@entity8 has suffered from a rare type of kidney disease , atypical haemolytic uraemic syndrome ( @entity35 ) , since the age of five			1
it causes blood clots to develop in the blood vessels of the kidneys and , eventually , kidney failure			1
the schoolboy , from @entity43 in @entity10 , needed dialysis every night for five years			2
he was put on the waiting list for a donor when he was eight			0
a new kidney from a family member was not possible and @entity8 knew that a kidney from an altruistic living donor was his best option			1
@entity8 ’s mother @entity52 said : ‘ those years on dialysis were very stressful and restrictive on our lives			1
‘ we knew that he was really poorly and would eventually need a transplant			0
i had to set up the dialysis machine and get @entity8 on it by 7pm each evening so he would be off it in time to get ready for school the next morning			1
@entity8 ( pictured in hospital ) had to have dialysis every night for five years before the transplant			1
none of his relatives were able to give him a new kidney so he was dependent on a donation from a stranger selfless : mr @entity20 says he decided to donate a kidney as a way of saying thank you for all of the ' great things ' that have happened in his life ‘ i needed to change his dressings before attaching him to the machine and also had to give him weekly injections			1
‘ it was heart - breaking knowing how much @entity8 disliked all of this , but we had no choice as his kidneys were n’t working and we had to filter his blood			2
’ donors and recipients normally remain anonymous but @entity8 and mr @entity20 decided to waive that right to highlight the benefits of organ donation			1
@entity8 underwent the surgery in 2011 and met mr @entity20 this year			1
his mother said : ‘ our lives have changed so much , it ’s hard to believe			0
@entity8 ( pictured in hospital ) was the first person at @entity9 to receive a kidney from an altruistic living donor mr @entity20 ( pictured with his wife , @entity101 ) said : ' i ca n't pinpoint the exact moment when the idea to donate a kidney first came to me			1
i suppose what started out as a thought grew into a quiet conviction that it was the right thing to do ' ‘ before the transplant , we had to wait for @entity8 to come off the machine so we could get together and open our presents around the christmas tree			2
‘ on his birthdays , we usually brought his presents up to his room			0
@entity118 is so different now , and @entity8 is definitely looking forward to the celebrations this year			2
‘ when we heard about the match , we were told the organ was from a living donor who had decided to donate a kidney to a stranger			1
we were really surprised that someone would be so selfless			0
’ mr @entity20 underwent the operation at @entity128 , @entity28 during a planned sabbatical from his gp work			2
he said : ‘ i ca n’t pinpoint the exact moment when the idea to donate a kidney first came to me			0
i suppose what started out as a thought grew into a quiet conviction that it was the right thing to do - a chance to say thank you for all the great things that have happened in my life			1
@entity8 ( pictured in hospital ) suffered from a rare type of kidney disease , atypical haemolytic uraemic syndrome ( @entity35 ) , which causes blood clots to develop in the blood vessels of the kidneys and , eventually , kidney failure @entity8 's mother @entity52 said : ' those years on dialysis were very stressful and restrictive on our lives			1
we knew that he was really poorly and would eventually need a transplant ' ‘ looking back , i can see there ’s been a bit of a “ renal thread ” running through my life			0
‘ my grandmother lived for 35 years after having one of her kidneys removed			0
i watched a kidney transplant operation when i was a medical student			0
twenty years ago a friend of mine had a transplant after developing renal failure			2
‘ my wife @entity101 , who is a dietician , was for many years part of a renal dietetics team			0
as a gp , i have seen just how important organ donation is and how many lives have been saved through transplants			0
’ mr @entity20 underwent a rigorous assessment before the operation , both mentally and physically			2
he was also tested to ensure his remaining kidney would function well			0
dr @entity175 , a consultant kidney specialist who leads the kidney transplant programme at @entity9 , said : ‘ we are delighted with @entity8 ’s progress since his transplant			2
each year up to 36 of our patients undergo kidney transplants but @entity8 was the first one in our hospital to receive a kidney from a healthy member of the public who was also a complete stranger			2
donors and recipients normally remain anonymous but @entity8 and mr @entity20 decided to waive that right to highlight the benefits of organ donation ‘ the numbers of children , young people and adults on the transplant waiting list far outweigh the number of organs that are available for transplant			1
‘ it can sometimes be difficult to find a suitable donor among living relatives and there simply are not enough people on the organ donor register willing to donate after their deaths			2
‘ altruistic non-directed kidney donation from individuals who are prepared to selflessly undergo a major operation opens up another vital source of organs			0
’ mr @entity20 ’s consultant surgeon , @entity211 , said : ‘ the number of altruistic kidney donations has been on the increase here in @entity28 over the last few years			1
dr @entity175 , at @entity9 , said : ' we are delighted with @entity8 's progress since his transplant			2
each year up to 36 of our patients undergo kidney transplants but @entity8 was the first one in our hospital to receive a kidney from a healthy member of the public who was also a complete stranger ' ‘ since the start of this type of donation in 2007 , we have seen 31 altruistic donations			1
this is one of the most selfless acts a person can do and we know that a healthy person can live a perfectly normal life with one good kidney			0
‘ in 2012 , @entity28 contributed the largest number of altruistic kidneys in the country			0
’ figures released in may showed that the number of living people giving one of their organs to a stranger almost tripled in one year in the @entity243			0
the @entity244 approved 104 altruistic organ donations in 2012 - 13 compared with 38 the previous year			0
atypical haemolytic uraemic syndrome is a rare condition that causes blood clots to form in the small blood vessels of the kidneys			1
they can restrict , or block , the blood flow to the kidneys and cause kidney failure			1
the condition can cause anaemia which results in pale skin , jaundice , fatigue and shortness of breath			0
sufferers can also experience easy bruising , abnormal bleeding and end - stage renal disease			0
the condition is estimated to occur in one in every 500,000 people each year			0
about 20 per cent of sufferers have a family history of the condition			0

@entity8 suffered from a rare kidney disease which caused blood clots to develop in the blood vessels in his kidneys resulting in kidney failure
he had to be on dialysis every night for five years before the transplant
none of his relatives were able to donate a kidney so he was dependent on receiving an organ from a deceased donor or an altruistic stranger
@entity20 , a gp , decided to donate a kidney as a way of saying thank you for all of the ' great things ' that have happened in his life
he was found to be a match for @entity8 and they underwent surgery in 2011
they have just met for the first time after waiving their right to anonymity
