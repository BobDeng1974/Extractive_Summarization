in the coastal redwood forests of central @entity5 , scientists trying to unravel the mystery surrounding the reproductive problems of dozens of endangered condors think they have uncovered the culprit : the long - banned pesticide @entity8			1
the soaring scavengers with wingspans wider than @entity12 players are tall were reintroduced to the rugged coast of @entity14 in 1997 after a century - long absence			0
upon arrival , the birds found plenty to eat , with dead @entity5 sea lions and other marine mammals littering the craggy shoreline			2
while a good food source , sea lion blubber often has high levels of @entity8 , a pesticide banned in 1972 that has proven to be a persistent pollutant because it accumulates in bodies of creatures throughout the food chain when animals eat one another			1
endangered : condors on @entity5 's central coast are having reproductive problems because of ddt once used widely in agriculture , @entity8 was banned because it is a human toxin considered a possible carcinogen by the @entity37			1
@entity38 , executive director of @entity39 and a co-author of a new study on condors , said researchers who spent six years studying their reproductive problems have ' established a strong link ' to @entity8 in the birds ' food source			1
the peer - reviewed paper written by 10 condor experts , including biologists from the @entity52 and @entity53 zoos and the @entity54 , is being published this month in the @entity56 journal ' @entity57			0
' ' in science , rarely is anything definitive but we 've established a strong link between ... @entity8 and eggshell thinning in @entity5 condors , ' said mr @entity38			1
dinner time : condors feed on the remains of a marine mammal on a beach in @entity14 the eggshell mystery began in 2006 , when a biologist inspecting a condor nest in the cavity of a redwood tree on the central @entity5 coast found the first thin shell			1
over the next six years , the scientists observed condors feeding on dozens of sea lions , and found that the @entity14 condor population had a low hatching success — just 20 - 40 percent — for 16 nesting pairs			0
in contrast , 70 - 80 percent of southern @entity5 condors in the @entity84 area had hatched successfully over the same time			1
the southern @entity5 condors are inland , and sea lions are not a food source			1
biologists familiar with the ravages of @entity8 in bird populations immediately suspected the widely used pesticide as a factor			2
tests since the 1970s have found high levels of @entity8 in sea lions ; and studies have linked @entity8 's metabolized version , @entity99 , to egg shell thinning in birds , including brown pelicans and bald eagles			2
majestic : @entity65 wingspans are wider than @entity12 players are tall the condor study attributed at least eight of 16 egg failures to thinning from @entity8			2
one shell found crushed in a nest was 54 - percent thinner than normal			0
thinning can also allow bacteria to more easily enter the eggs			0
but why did the sea lions have such high ddt levels in the first place ? the scientists theorize that the sea mammals were exposed when they migrated to the central coast from southern @entity5 , where the @entity121 dumped @entity8 with impunity for decades until the 1970s			1
the @entity124 plant and the ocean off @entity126 where it dumped @entity8 are now listed as @entity129 ' sites			0
less hatching : @entity5 condor eggs hatch less than half as much on the central coast than they do to the south ' a vast majority of @entity5 sea lions have spent at least a portion of their lives in the waters of southern @entity5 , which is the most ddt - contaminated coastal environment in the world , ' mr @entity38 said			1
' @entity143 movements of sea lions provide a pathway of @entity8 to condors in central @entity5			1
' the study 's authors and other experts agree that lead ammunition , not @entity8 , is the main threat to the survivability of condors			2
but @entity154 , a former condor program coordinator for @entity155 who did not participate in the study , called the paper 's findings helpful scientific evidence that will add to the overall picture of threats facing condor recovery			0
another former condor program manager , @entity163 , was critical of the @entity8 study , however			0
he said it only looks closely at one potential cause of reproductive problems — @entity8 — and fails to properly evaluate the potential effects of other contaminants and factors that may be involved and more important			0
' ddt is not the only thing that causes eggshell thinning , and the authors of the paper do n't present a significant correlation of @entity8 with the thinning found , and thus do not do a convincing job of linking ddt with the happenings in @entity14			0
' @entity14 : though beautiful , @entity14 is contaminated with @entity8 study author and @entity180 wildlife biologist @entity178 defended the team 's work , saying all data pointed to the pesticide as the problem			2
' we collected data on many different environmental toxins but none , other than @entity99 , were even in the ballpark known to cause reproductive failure in birds , ' mr @entity178 said			0
in the final analysis , the study 's authors say the @entity8 problem will fade over time			0
' like bald eagles and other bird species previously affected by @entity8 , the thickness of condor eggshells should recover as contamination declines in the coastal environment , ' said co-author @entity203 , an expert on the effects of @entity8 on birds .			1

@entity8 pesticide was banned in 1972 , but still pollutes the environment
despite the danger posed to the environment , it was only banned because it was considered carcinogenic to humans
@entity5 condors hatch eggs at a *fraction* of the rate @entity217 affected condors do in southern @entity5
