' @entity0 took to @entity1 to show off his drive in a @entity7 the tweet was deleted shortly afterwards , but many of @entity0 's 2.4million followers had already seen the clip and some were far from impressed			1
one fan tweeted : ' think you should auction it for a road safety charity after irresponsible behaviour in the video you posted			0
' although @entity0 claimed his @entity7 can do 0 - 100kph in his tweet , there is no suggestion that the 29 - year - old was breaking any laws during the 15 - second clip			1
@entity0 's life in the fast line will continue this weekend as the @entity40 driver looks to increase his three - point lead on @entity42 in the @entity44 @entity43			2

' back then it was all instinct , i think my maturity was at a very early stage and i probably think that is the biggest change and hopefully i will keep getting more and more mature			0
' also my work ethic			0
my work ethic is a lot better , more serious and more understanding - it seems to be working well for me			0
@entity0 leads the pack into the first corner at the @entity69			2
he went on to claim victory ' this has been the most consistent and best - performing season i have had in @entity56 and i want to continue that for many , many years - it is like building blocks , i just need to keep working on it			2
