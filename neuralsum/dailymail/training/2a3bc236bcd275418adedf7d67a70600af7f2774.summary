a 19 - year - old who has suffered from a recurring brain tumour for five years is desperately trying to raise $ 120,000 so he can fly to the @entity2 and receive treatment not available in @entity4			1
@entity5 , from @entity6 on the @entity7 , was first diagnosed with the tumour when he was 14 and has since had four operations to reduce its size , undergone months of chemotherapy and suffered a stroke			1
the family have run out of options in @entity4 and with the tumour starting to grow close to @entity17 's brain stem their only hope is to fly him to the @entity2 before february for expensive proton therapy which has a 95 percent chance of working			1
his mother @entity23 , 51 , says he has no chance of surviving without the treatment			2
@entity26 visit @entity5 ( second from left ) after his most recent operation in september the 19 - year - old has suffered from a recurring brain tumour which was first discovered when he was 14 ' there 's nothing they can do here apart from stopping the tumour growing as fast , but they ca n't even say that will work , ' ms @entity23 told @entity36			1
' the proton therapy has a 95 per cent chance of working , which you know is still not 100 per cent but it 's a better shot than what we 've got here			2
' i spoke to the doctor [ in the @entity2 ] and he said they 've had enormous success , particularly in young adults			1
' the type of treatment available in @entity4 – photon radiation - is very invasive and dangerous , ms @entity23 said			1
' it damages every single tissue that it touches , ' she said			2
' it would obviously damage his brain , but we do n't know what part			2
' but with proton radiation [ in the @entity2 ] a pencil beam can go through at a very slow rate and the beam can also come out the same way it came in , so it reduces the damage of healthy tissue			1
' the @entity7 teen ( pictured before and after his first operation ) has suffered weight gain and a stroke @entity17 is fitted with a mask before he receives radiation treatment in hospital in @entity4 the medical equipment for proton therapy , which costs $ 200 million and takes two years to build , has not yet been brought to @entity4			1
the government has subsidised patients to travel overseas for similar treatments in the past , but the application process for funding would take too long so the family are trying to raise the $ 120,000 themselves			1
@entity17 's tumour is not cancerous but it keeps growing back and the side effects from numerous operations and bouts of chemotherapy to reduce its size have meant @entity17 has not been able to life a normal teenage life			2
' it 's been a whole lifestyle change , ' he said			0
' i guess i used to be just normal and then it was just really overwhelming , i gained a lot of weight and i felt tired all the time			0
' the last operation @entity17 had in september caused a stroke , affecting his vision and movement in his left side which means the avid drummer can no longer play in his band			0
he graduated from high school but was unable to attend for long periods of time and his vision is impaired so he ca n't drive			0
the medical equipment for proton therapy , which costs $ 200 million and takes two years to build , has not yet been brought to @entity4 his mother @entity23 ( pictured left ) says he has no chance of surviving without the treatment			1
@entity17 pictured with a friend at the beach earlier this month ' i think he lost a lot of confidence , he was a very outgoing child , ' ms @entity23 said			0
' he 'd love to work but it 's hard finding a job , he is always tired because of the drugs			0
' like his peers , @entity17 has career aspirations – in @entity17 's case his dream is to work in the film industry – but he had to drop out of a @entity134 course earlier this year due to his illness			0
' it 's been a roller - coaster ride - you feel you go one step forward and then three steps back , ' ms @entity23 said			0
' he has short - term memory loss from previous operations			0
' in the past he 's been in a lot of agony , or has suffered constant vomiting whether it be from the chemo or the pressure on the brain			0
like his peers @entity17 has career aspirations – in @entity17 's case his dream is to work in the film industry – but he had to drop out of a @entity134 course earlier this year due to his illness @entity17 had to miss long periods of school but was able to graduate and attend his year 12 formal ( pictured ) ' you sort of wake up and have to take every day as it comes			0
' three weeks ago the family 's neighbours came together to form a committee to help fundraise for the 19 - year - old , because the sooner he can receive treatment the more chance doctors have of successfully removing the tumour			1
if they reach their goal of $ 120,000 @entity17 would need to go to the clinic in the @entity2 and he would undergo intensive treatment every day for six weeks			1
the committee have held sausage sizzles , local businesses have put tins at their counters and they have a street garage sale and concert planned for later this year			0
a @entity175 page and crowdfunding page have also been set up for donations and so far $ 37,490 has been raised			2
' it 's pretty overwhelming , it 's put a massive smile on my face , ' @entity17 said .			0

@entity5 was first diagnosed with a tumour when he was 14
now 19 , the @entity7 teen has endured five years of intensive treatment
but there is nothing else @entity4 doctors can do to remove the tumour
@entity194 and neighbours are trying to raise $ 120,000 so he can fly to the @entity2 and get treatment
