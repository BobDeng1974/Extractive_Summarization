by @entity0 this is the incredible model railway that covers a couple ’s entire home in @entity5 , @entity6			1
the labour of love took over 10 years to construct and cost £ 32,000 - which the couple paid for themselves			1
the remote - controlled train set is estimated to be the length of a football pitch ( 130 yards ) and weaves all over their garden			1
it took three tons of concrete and shale to lay the track in their back yard and they are constantly tinkering with it to make it bigger and better			0
the set belongs to @entity26 , 73 , and his wife @entity27 who have been collecting model trains for a decade in their three bedroom semi-detached house which costs £ 220,000			1
football pitch : mr @entity26 stands in the middle of his handy work - which is estimated to be the length of a football field ( 130 yards ) incredible detail : the railway has an incredible amount of detailed models in it - including a coach , tractor and train line a miniature town : a fun fair is pictured behind a miniature town and a blue coach can be seen driving through the bottom right of the scene over the years , their passion for trains has meant that their home has become crammed full of train sets			1
the couple reveal that they have sets in their loft , garden and garage and have built each one by paying attention to every single detail			1
most of the track in the loft has been made from plywood and some of the models dotted around the set are handcrafted			0
the model train - enthusiasts even have replicas of the @entity72 , @entity73 and a reproduction of @entity75 in @entity76 among their fleet			2
all aboard : @entity26 holds onto a model train above the model railway that he built in his loft hidden gem : mr @entity26 gets to be a kid again as he sits and lays his hand on top of a red train inside his home the couple 's friend , @entity87 helped the couple to put the set together in their garden			1
he said : ‘ i never had a particular interest in model trains before , but since i ’ve been helping out here that has changed			0
i have been completely sucked into their world			0
‘ i have n't measured it but it must stretch the length of a football field by now			1
we put in the bridge overlooking the track and we extended the track itself the changes we have made over the last couple of weeks have really stepped it up			0
' the train - set owners pair have been married for 53 years and have one daughter			2
after building their ultimate set in their garden , mr @entity26 decided he was keen to use it to raise funds for @entity118			1
the couple will open their home to the public to raise money for the service on june 15			1
visitors will be admitted into the garden for free and the couple have organised a burger van and candy floss machine to provide food and drink on the day			2
the generous couple have already held two similar fundraising events in the past , raising around £ 2,000 for the air ambulance service			0
local officials , mayor @entity135 and @entity136 are expected to be among the visitors in june			0
however , the fundraising event also has special meaning for the couple			0
mr @entity26 suffers from @entity141 's and his wife has @entity143 and their ill - health has meant that they have both had to use the air ambulance service			2
mr @entity87 added : ‘ they really are an exceptional couple and what they have managed to do with their garden is amazing			0
‘ it is all @entity27 's design - without the old photographs she showed me i would not have known where to start in putting it all together			0
‘ they are not doing it because they have to - it is because they really want to do it			0
they have put so much into it and any donations on the day will be greatly appreciated			0
’ mr @entity26 , a former electrician , said : ‘ being able to open up my garden is a great way for me to be able to give something back			2
’ park : in this train set , people can be seen walking past a park , the couple spared absolutely no detail whilst putting the set together fun fair : a carousel , @entity178 and helter skelter are all lined up behind a train that can be seen shooting past this beautiful scene @entity72 : the @entity72 , far right , can be seen hurtling past a windmill located near a town in this railway set town gathering : little miniature models can be seen gathering in a town in this railway set in the countryside train enthusiasts : @entity26 , right , and @entity191 , left , beam together as they stand near one of their model railways in their @entity6 home leaves on the line : mr @entity26 , a former electrician is looking forward to opening up his garden to show off his trains to visitors on time : a @entity206 train emerges from a tunnel near buildings in this part of the track , the couple spent £ 32,000 on their sets @entity214 master : mr @entity26 stands beside just one of his replicas - which includes the @entity72 and @entity73 trains			1
