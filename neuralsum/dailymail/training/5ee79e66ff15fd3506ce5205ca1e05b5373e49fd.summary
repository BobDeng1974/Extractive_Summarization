by @entity0 when sending a text or instant message , sometimes words just are n’t enough and that ’s where emoticons come in			2
on @entity8 , users can already track how many of these emoticons from the emoji list of designs are tweeted every second , using @entity13			1
and now a developer has taken the most popular designs and plotted them on a globe to see these emojis being tweeted worldwide , in real time			1
the @entity20 globe , pictured , was created by @entity22 developer @entity21			1
it shows the most popular 400 emojis , according to website @entity25 , that are being posted on @entity8 in real time			1

these include smiley faces , winking faces , love hearts , food items , travel - related emojis , and more			2
but , because so many emoticons are tweeted every second – so much so , @entity25 comes with an epilepsy warning – @entity21 chose to only plot the tweets that contain geolocation data			1
this means a user has opted in to reveal their location each time they tweet			2
the globe spins slowly on its axis around the equator , but clicking the image and dragging it with the mouse cursor lets viewers pinpoint particular countries and regions			2
