scroll down to click on full match reports for @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 comeback : @entity9 ( @entity21 ) scores @entity1 's fourth goal against @entity4 despite being reduced to 10 - men @entity25 's sequence of four consecutive victories came to an end as an impressive @entity29 side left @entity30 with a well deserved point from a 1 - 1 draw			1
the @entity25 went into the game on a crest of a wave after a fine run that included a derby win at @entity38 and they looked good for another three points when @entity41 scored against his former club after just 14 minutes			2
but @entity44 's side retained their composure and levelled just before half - time through @entity47 , the man who replaced @entity41 at @entity48			0
@entity50 impressive attacking duo of @entity51 and @entity52 combined to ensure that the team celebrated 125 years of league football at @entity55 in style with a 3 - 1 @entity57 win over @entity58			1
@entity51 opened the scoring before @entity52 helped himself to a double as @entity62 's side collected their fourth win from five games in the match the club had earmarked to commemorate the landmark			0
the duo put @entity50 two goals ahead before @entity71 gave @entity58 a lifeline from the penalty spot , but his side could not build on that with @entity52 sealing his brace to sentence @entity58 to a second defeat in three games			2
all good things : @entity25 100 % start to the @entity57 was ended by a 1 - 1 draw against @entity29 defender @entity82 scored deep into added time to rescue a point for @entity85 in a 2 - 2 draw against unbeaten @entity87 at the @entity88			1
striker @entity89 twice put the @entity90 ahead to take his tally to five goals , but @entity93 produced two headers of his own to give @entity96 's men a share of the points			0
the @entity99 went behind for the second successive game when @entity102 striker @entity89 struck after only four minutes			0
@entity103 endured a frustrating afternoon when they were held at home for the first time this season as @entity38 fought back to draw 1 - 1 at the @entity107			1
@entity108 pounced from close range to give @entity103 an early lead but , after @entity111 was taken off with what looked a serious arm injury , @entity114 headed in from a free - kick in the 52nd minute			0
@entity116 was in the @entity38 team that drew 4 - 4 at @entity103 last season , but his absence from the squad only added to growing speculation that he will join @entity122 on monday			2
equal terms : @entity108 celebrates after drawing @entity103 level with @entity38 @entity125 scored one and set up another as @entity128 made it three wins from their opening five @entity133 games by beating crisis club @entity134 2 - 1 at the den. the @entity137 international converted @entity140 's free - kick after 33 minutes before setting up @entity141 to make it two just after the break			1

@entity147 grabbed the only goal as @entity149 edged to a smash - and - grab @entity133 win at @entity151			2
the @entity149 , who narrowly missed out on the play - offs last season , had picked up just five points from their opening five games			0
yet the long trip back home will feel a great deal better after @entity147 's neat finish earned an undeserved three points on @entity162			0
at the double : @entity165 forward @entity164 netted a brace for @entity165 against @entity167 @entity165 wiped the floor with beleaguered @entity167 in a horribly one - sided @entity133 encounter at the @entity170			2
@entity164 was again the pick of the @entity173 players with two first - half goals as the home side led 3 - 0 at the break			1
@entity177 and substitute @entity178 grabbed the others for @entity165 , who could have won even more comprehensively than 4 - 0 such was their total superiority			1
@entity181 hit the crossbar twice but lost out 2 - 0 to a workmanlike @entity183 who struck in added time in both halves			1
@entity186 put the @entity187 in front just before the interval after being set up by @entity190 , and the game was made safe in the final seconds when substitute @entity192 scored from close range			0
