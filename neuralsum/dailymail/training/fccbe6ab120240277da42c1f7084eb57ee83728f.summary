by @entity0 published : 06:59 est , 29 may 2012 updated : 21:03 est , 29 may 2012 the ‘ boomerang generation ’ is growing as soaring numbers of young adults return home to live with their parents			1
three million have moved out of the family home for university or work – only to move back in again when independent living becomes too much of a hardship			1
the numbers have swelled over the past 15 years as rising property prices and a stagnant jobs market make living with mum and dad more appealing to those in their 20s and 30s			1
according to an analysis from the @entity23 , nearly two million men and more than a million women aged between 20 and 35 live with their parents			2
the number of adults who return to the family home after living elsewhere – known as ‘ boomerang children ’ – has risen by a fifth since 1997 , with most attracted by the low cost of living			1
one in three men aged 20 to 35 is still living with their parents , the @entity23 said			2
its report went on : ‘ there are a number of reasons that might account for this growth in numbers living with parents , but it is noteworthy that the increase over the past decade coincides with an increase in the average price paid by first - time home - buyers of 40 per cent between 2002 and 2011			1
’ tough : more and more young adults can not afford to leave home and stay with parents until at least their mid- 30s			1
the phenomenon of boomerang children was first noticed in the early 2000s , when growing numbers of graduates were competing for work and rising house prices were putting property out of reach for many			2
the latest figures , from the government ’s large - scale @entity56 , reveal that 1.8million men and 1.1million women in their 20s and early 30s are living with their parents			1
one in five men is living with his parents at the age of 28 , and more than half of men do not leave the family home until they are 22			1
there are fewer women among the boomerang children because they are more likely to set up home with a partner at an earlier age – often picking a man who is older than them			0
women are also more likely to go to university and to move away from home to do so , and single mothers are more likely to become the main custodian of their children			2
according to the report , there are 643,000 women living in their own homes with their children as lone parents			0
the report said : ‘ over 600,000 more women than men were lone parents in their own household			0
when relationships end , women are more likely to take caring responsibilities for any children			0
’ facts : @entity23 map showing men and women aged 20 - 34 living with parents between 1997 and 2011 has increased detail : @entity23 graph showing percentage of men and women aged 20 - 34 living with their parents by age and sex in the @entity105 in 2011 it added : ‘ by the age of 34 , only 7 per cent of men and 2 per cent of women were living with their parents			1
a couple of factors are associated with this age pattern			0
firstly , average earnings of young people increase during their 20s and level off in their mid- 30s			2
‘ secondly , the likelihood of living with a partner is higher at older ages			0
’ nearly two - thirds are living with someone by the time they are 31 , the report said , and so can benefit from pooled income to cover rent or a mortgage			0
the number of young adults who live with their parents was lowest in @entity128 , at fewer than one in five			1
the report said this was because of ‘ the influx of young people from other regions and countries ’			0
it was most common in @entity136 , at 35.3 per cent			0
the report brought fresh calls for the government to encourage older couples to move to smaller homes to create more housing space			0
@entity142 of the @entity144 campaign group , which has called for tax breaks for older people who move house , said : ‘ the coalition can not continue to leave young people ’s housing and employment prospects to a market stacked in favour of the older generation			0

nearly three million young adults living at home in 2011 , an increase of almost *500,000* since 1997
' @entity160 has highest proportion because more do not leave their parents until they are married or *settled* - down
40 per cent rise in average asking prices means that many more are *saving* for longer to get their first home
not *wanting* to settle down or marry is the other main cause , especially among men
@entity128 has lowest numbers as so many come from elsewhere in @entity105 to work or study
