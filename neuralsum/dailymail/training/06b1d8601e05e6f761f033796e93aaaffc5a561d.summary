by @entity1 reporter doctors treating survivors of the @entity5 air crash have called for the use of seatbelts on planes to be reviewed after passengers suffered spinal injuries even though they were buckled up			1
two @entity12 students died and 181 people were injured when @entity14 from @entity15 crashed during landing on saturday			0
dr @entity16 , neurosurgery chief at @entity17 , said several survivors needed surgery to stabilise their spines after their upper bodies were flung forward and then backwards over their lap belts – which did keep them seated and saved their lives			1
fireball : a total of 307 people were on board the plane when it crash - landed			0
most managed to walk away from the crash aftermath : this chilling picture of the interior of the crashed jetliner was released by the @entity34 some passengers also had ligaments so torn that they can not hold neck and back joints in place			1
dr @entity16 said one option to prevent this was three - point seatbelts , although he admitted that they ‘ might just move the injuries up further ’			1
the airline industry says introducing such belts would increase fares and lessen comfort			0
experts said the survival of 305 people on board @entity14 is a testament to the advance of airline safety			0
still , @entity16 said even among those who suffered mild spine trauma , he is struck by a pattern that shows how their upper bodies were flung forward and then backward over the lap belts that kept them in their seats and undoubtedly saved their lives			2
the injuries are somewhat reminiscent of the days before shoulder belts in cars , although much more severe , said dr. @entity70 of the @entity71 , who is not involved with the survivors ' care			2
does that mean shoulder belts in airplanes would prevent such injuries ? @entity70 said that 's simplistic considering how much more speed and force are involved in a plane crash			1
shoulder belts might just transfer that force to the neck , he cautioned			0
victims : @entity87 , 16 - year - old schoolgirls @entity85 , left , and @entity88 , right , pose for photos in @entity90			0
right , @entity88 is pictured on the right , and @entity85 on the left			0
the two girls were killed in the @entity95 plane crash on saturday and one may have been hit by an emergency responder vehicle passengers aboard the stricken @entity14 ' grabbed their luggage before their children ' it has today been revealed , as video footage showing the dramatic moment they scrambled to safety has emerged ' if you put in the shoulder belt , it might just move the injuries up further			1
your head weighs a tremendous amount , ' agreed @entity16			0
he hopes to study the issue , comparing survivors ' injuries to where they sat. the airline industry says adding three - point seatbelts to airplanes would require major changes to seat design that would mean higher airfares and less comfort			2
some business class seats have added a type of shoulder restraint , but those seats are more like beds and often do n't face forward			0
meanwhile , @entity70 said assuming the ' crash position ' - leaning forward with the head as far down as possible and arms over it - can limit the spine jolting back and forth and offer some protection			2
it 's not clear if any survivors of saturday 's crash had time to do so			1
survivors : passengers arrive at @entity17 on saturday after the crash landing			1

two survivors of saturday 's crash are still unable to move their legs
others being treated at @entity17 have needed surgery to stabilize their spines
doctors say the pattern of back injuries were caused by the passengers being flung back and *fourth* over their seatbelts
