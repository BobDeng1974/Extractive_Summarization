by @entity0 and @entity1 last updated at 10:32 am on 28th september 2011 a lottery game that starts next week gives too little to charity , it was claimed last night			1
the @entity4 has been set up as a rival to the @entity6 with cash also going to good causes			1
tickets will cost £ 1 , of which 20.3p will go toward projects that tackle health inequalities			1
it will operate as a series of 51 lotteries , each representing a local authority area			1
each will take it in turn to be the beneficiary of the draw			1
launch : left to right , @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29 however , the @entity6 donates 40 per cent more – 28p from every £ 1 ticket			1
local raffles typically give away more than half their profits			1
@entity33 , who is worth an estimated £ 950million and owns x-rated tv channels as well as @entity35 and several newspapers , is behind the venture			1
the lottery ’s organisers say they will not disclose which good causes will benefit until next month but around £ 50million will go to charity in the first year			1
projects are likely to include funding for specialist dementia nurses and counselling for young carers			2
critics accuse mr @entity33 of profiteering on the back of charities and undermining more generous lotteries			2
@entity52 chief executive sir @entity51 , branded mr @entity33 a ' disgrace ' , saying : ' he is only giving 20p out of a pound to charity - not 28p as the @entity6 does			1
' so if people switch to @entity33 from the @entity6 charities will lose out			2
' i call on him to raise it to 28p if he actually cares about health charities			2
' tickets for @entity4 go on sale this thursday and it offers a top prize of £ 100,000 for matching five numbers			2
there is no cap on how many people can claim this prize			2
people who match four numbers will win £ 500 , while three numbers will be awarded £ 50			2
the draw will be shown during adverts on @entity74 and on @entity35 each saturday and will be hosted by @entity27			0
sir @entity51 : calls on @entity33 to raise amount given to charity to 28 % mr @entity33 has signed up more than 40,000 retailers to sell tickets for his @entity80 more than the number of shops selling tickets for the @entity6			1
sir @entity51 told @entity85 : ' if he ( mr @entity33 ) is setting the health lottery up as a direct competitor - and it looks like he is - charities will lose out			1
' it will be robbing charity @entity91 to pay charity @entity93			1
' he also criticised mr @entity33 for setting up a separate new administrative machine for the new health lottery			0
' it 's wasting money that could be going to good causes , ' he said			0
' the @entity101 already does this effectively and has a strong track record in grant making			0
' it also supports charities across the sector , from health to the arts to sports			0
' @entity111 , of the @entity112 , which runs weekly lotteries to raise money for 115 hospices , warned the venture posed a major threat to local charities			0
he added : ' it 's potentially diverting huge amounts of money away from local hospice care at a time when charities are already losing revenue as a result of the economic downturn			0
the new health lottery will be licensed by the @entity128			0
because it is a ' society lottery ' it will not have to pay 12 per cent lottery duty to the government , which @entity132 must pay			1
under its rules , the health lottery must give at least 20 per cent of the revenue from ticket sales to good causes			0
the rest can be used for prizes and the operator 's expenses			0
@entity4 chief executive @entity141 , defended the decision to give the minimum amount , saying : ' @entity6 gives less money in prizes , we give more			0
so if we give more in prizes there is less to give away			0
' he added : ' the health lottery game is a fresh new alternative which has one single good cause at its heart - health			0
' we will be offering people the opportunity to win a life - changing amount of money while at the same time contributing to tackling real health issues in their own communities			0
' mr @entity33 's firm , @entity158 , owns newspapers including the @entity160 and @entity161 .			0

it will be robbing charity @entity91 to pay charity @entity93 , warns sir @entity51
