he may be out of the @entity2 championships – but the reasons for @entity5 ’s four - letter outbursts during his humiliating defeat by @entity7 were still being feverishly discussed yesterday			1
@entity40 : face of the defeated : @entity5 's loss was chronicled by the change in expressions of girlfriend @entity9 the story of @entity5 ’s defeat was chronicled blow by blow in the facial expressions of his loyal girlfriend @entity9			1
occasionally she appeared to offer advice beyond the standard ‘ come on @entity5 ! ’ , preferred by much of the @entity54 crowd			2
fact : they did n’t leave together after the match – @entity5 jumped in an @entity59 courtesy car immediately after his post-match press conference and had not changed out of his kit			1
their separate departures would not normally be cause for speculation but miss @entity24 did accompany him after his 2012 defeat by @entity68 – and on wednesday was said to have been ‘ looking upset ’ when she left without him			0
wicked internet speculation that she had chosen five minutes before the big match to dump him / tell him she was pregnant / say she had always liked @entity68 can not be substantiated			2
but the breaking news last night was that miss @entity24 had accidentally let slip the ending of a box - set tv series they had been watching			1
yesterday his grandfather @entity77 , 82 , said of the ‘ five - minutes ’ mystery : ‘ normally he ’ll be alone in his dressing room so i have no idea what could possibly have gone wrong			2
’ @entity16 : coach : miss @entity16 was seen sprinting up the stairs to the competitors ’ box just moments before @entity5 came on to court the @entity89 former world number one started coaching @entity5 after he lost in the semi-finals of the @entity91 last month			1
recently when asked about their professional partnership , she volunteered that things were getting ‘ smoother and smoother ’ perhaps implying there was a time when they were less so			0
fact : miss @entity16 was seen sprinting up the stairs to the competitors ’ box just moments before @entity5 came on to court to face @entity7			1
did she tell him to change his strategy ? might she have clashed with him over tactics ? was something she said playing on @entity5 ’s brooding mind ? yesterday a track - suited @entity5 arrived at her flat near the ground for a pre-arranged meeting			1
he was carrying what appeared to be a card in an envelope with a single name written on it			0
cards declaring ‘ sorry i told you to shut the f * * * up ’ are not widely available – but in any case , it is @entity16 ’s 35th birthday tomorrow			1
the pair spent more than two hours inside before @entity5 left alone			2
but conspiracy theories which suggested coach and player were about to separate amid some unspecified acrimony fell flat when he failed to stomp out in a strop			2
' off his game ' : @entity5 's play was ' not quite right ' during their warm - up according to his friend @entity7 enraged : the defending champion also yelled ' shut the f * * * up ! ' at his team according to photographers speculation : the 23 - year - old @entity132 ( pictured with @entity5 after his win ) said ' it is just a feeling ' when he told reporters @entity5 was not playing to his best ability			1
the pair are close friends and play together regularly @entity27 : @entity5 ’s mother and long - time former coach remains a constant presence			1
except , that is , for some possibly critical minutes on wednesday at the start of the match			1
fact : mrs @entity27 was at court 18 to cheer her other son , @entity148 , to victory in his mixed doubles opener with @entity152 @entity151			1
little brother @entity5 had already lost the first set by the time she arrived			1
last week @entity5 joked he was ‘ the number two son ’ , and that his family seemed to spend a great deal of time watching the number one			1
support : @entity5 ’s mother @entity162 and long - time former coach remains a constant presence			1
except , that is , for some possibly critical minutes on wednesday at the start of the match another theory : was mrs @entity27 shouting advice that contradicted @entity5 ’s coach ? perhaps			1
but even for a grumpy @entity171 in a foul mood , it is surely beyond the realms of possibility that he would tell his own mother to ‘ shut the f * * * up ’			1
afterwards she stressed she knew of nothing that might have upset him			0
@entity179 : @entity68 has entered the debate over @entity2 ’s all - white dress code , saying it is ‘ too strict ’			2
the seven - time champion urged the @entity59 to ‘ loosen its grip ’			0
he said : ‘ we ’re all white			0
@entity186 , white , full - on white … my personal opinion , i think it ’s too strict			0
‘ tighter rules were brought in this year amid concerns that sponsors were weaving more colour into players ’ kit			0
the couple ’s beloved border terrier , named after the @entity198 hit , has previously used @entity199 throughout her master ’s @entity2 appearances			0
this year she has not tweeted even a bark			0
has she been unwell ? fact : four years ago mrs @entity27 revealed @entity5 was ‘ worried sick ’ throughout the tournament after @entity205 fell ill. the banana : @entity5 has previously relied on bananas for their energy - giving qualities			1
fact : on the advice of a nutritionist , he cut back on bananas last year – and won @entity2			2
this year he admitted he was back on them – and lost			0
fate : play began on @entity54 at noon rather than the usual time of 1pm			0
@entity5 ’s early start led to suggestions afterwards that he he was not mentally prepared for his game			1
was he given only five minutes ’ notice of the change ? @entity5 dismissed the speculation in his @entity225 blog yesterday , declaring : ‘ there was nothing different in the build - up , and no reason to expect that kind of performance			1
’ @entity5 : perhaps the player himself is the only real suspect			2
could it simply be that he lost ? it is the only theory he publicly supports			0
‘ yeah , ’ said @entity5			2
i certainly lost the match , yeah			0
’ shock : @entity7 , who ranks at @entity240 in the world , was astounded when he secured his place in the semi-finals the fashions may have changed since their hit duet 45 years ago			2
but @entity246 and sir @entity248 ’s devotion to each other clearly has not			0
the singers have been firm friends since their pop heyday and released the duet @entity252 in 1969			0
yesterday , they arrived at the royal box arm - in - arm , laughing and joking as they enjoyed the women ’s semi-finals			0
they also chatted to love actually actor @entity259 and @entity261 star @entity260 in the @entity262			0
sir @entity248 , of course , is a @entity2 regular and in 1996 gave an impromptu performance of @entity266 on @entity54 during a long delay in play caused by rain			0
the singers have been firm friends since their pop heyday and released the duet @entity252 in 1969			0

@entity7 , who won 6 - 1 , 7 - 6 , 6 - 2 , said @entity5 was ' not quite right '
