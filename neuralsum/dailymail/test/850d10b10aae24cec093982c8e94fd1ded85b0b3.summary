the @entity59 described the story as ‘ completely false and defamatory ’			0
last night mr @entity0 said : ‘ it ’s categorically untrue			1
it ’s absolutely nothing to do with me			0

at the time , he said he had amended pages claiming he was ‘ a @entity75 , agnostic or crashed a car into a school wall ’			2

he has made a very clear statement about this and i have got nothing to add to that			0
' the conservative chairman told the @entity92 : ' this is one of the most bonkers stories i think i have seen during this election campaign			1
absolutely , totally without foundation			0
' it seems to be based on the word of a single @entity4 anonymous editor who , for all i know , is a @entity102 apparatchik			2
' an investigation by @entity4 claimed the @entity32 account ‘ is a ‘ sockpuppet of @entity0 ’ previous accounts on @entity4 ’			1
@entity107 refers to a fake online identity used ‘ for an improper purpose ’ and is banned on the site			0
among the changes revealed include information about @entity113 , who had disagreed with mr @entity0 over his support for a third runway at @entity116			2

mr @entity0 took the blame after the @entity130 over a ‘ patronising ’ picture he tweeted about cuts in beer tax and bingo which would help ‘ hardworking people do more of the things they enjoy ’			2
@entity32 edited mr @entity0 ’ wikipedia page to suggest he had unfairly taken the blame for the picture , which was the fault of mr @entity51 and chancellor @entity139			2
in september 2013 , @entity140 added these passages to @entity50 's @entity4 entry , highlighting her opposition to the expansion of @entity116 and an embarrassing incident in the @entity122 the user added the highlighted text about the gay marriage bill to @entity150 's page mr @entity0 's wikipedia page stated that he had edited the site ' removing negative information ' , as shown in the highlighted text top image , but @entity32 changed it to cast the minister in a better light a recent @entity159 edit , on @entity160 this year , changed the page of @entity162 , the shadow attorney general , adding a reference to the @entity102 mp having ‘ admitted breaking @entity122 rules by sending out invitations to a £ 45 - a - head @entity102 fundraising event from parliamentary email ’			1
two weeks earlier mr @entity162 had called on prime minister @entity19 to investigate mr @entity0 over his denials that he had continued to use the pseudonym @entity172 while he was an mp			1

@entity102 frontbencher @entity183 said : ‘ this is another embarrassing episode in the saga of @entity0			2
it ’s about time we had some answers , from him and from @entity19 who appointed him to run the @entity8 campaign			1
’ @entity190 campaign chairman @entity190 sent a light - hearted press release that read : ‘ @entity0 is a wonderful guy - he is a credit to the @entity8 , a fine sportsman and reads a book a day			1

’ the press release noted that it had been ‘ edited by @entity32 ’			0
mr @entity0 's own wikipedia page was edited by @entity32 in march 2014 to shift the blame for a controversial tweet on the budget to @entity139 and @entity51 ; the passage in question is pictured before and after the edit a passage added to @entity207 's page by @entity32 drew attention to his alleged disloyalty to @entity210 the highlighted passage appeared on labour mp @entity162 's wikipedia page after it was edited by @entity32 earlier this month in a statement released last night , mr @entity0 said : ' it is untrue from start to finish , and was quite likely dreamt up by the @entity102 press office			1

' a spokesman from @entity225 @entity224 , the @entity224 charity that supports @entity4 , told @entity17 : ' we would welcome any mps who choose to become editors , and are happy to provide training sessions to anyone who wants to learn			2

@entity172 was an alter ego that mr @entity0 used to promote get rich quick products before he became an mp			2
the revelation that he had used the alias even prompted a man to change his name to @entity172 by deed poll to stand against mr @entity0 in his @entity262 seat in next month ’s election , in the hope of embarrassing him			1
