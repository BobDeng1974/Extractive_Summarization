@entity0 might have called it poetic justice as @entity3 was sent off on the stroke of half - time to deliver a major blow to @entity8 's prospects of staying in the @entity9			1
@entity8 were left feeling hard - done - by as referee @entity10 denied them a couple of possible penalties and more significantly allowed @entity13 to stay on the pitch for a tackle worse than anything @entity3 did			1
all that would be called karma in @entity0 's book			0
the @entity21 manager condemned the @entity8 forward for a ' criminal challenge ' on @entity23 at @entity24 in february when he escaped unpunished and @entity23 was sent off for retaliation			1
@entity26 forward @entity13 ( right ) opens the scoring on his return to the first team at @entity31 the @entity33 international gestures after handing @entity26 the lead in their 1 - 0 defeat of @entity8 @entity26 midfielder @entity36 walks away with his head held low after missing a chance to give his side the lead from the spot @entity8 forward @entity3 reacts after being shown the red car by referee @entity10 just before half time @entity26 ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) : @entity43 6 ; @entity44 7.5 , @entity45 6.5 , @entity46 6.5 , @entity47 7 ; @entity48 6 ( @entity49 88 ) , @entity50 6 , @entity36 6 ; @entity51 8 , @entity52 ( @entity53 80 ) , @entity13 6.5 ( @entity54 61 6 ) unused subs : @entity56 ( @entity57 ) , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 goal : @entity13 29 ' booked : @entity13 @entity8 ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) : @entity62 7.5 ; @entity63 6.5 , @entity64 6 , @entity65 6.5 , @entity66 6 ; @entity10 5.5 ( @entity67 84 ) , @entity68 6.5 , @entity69 6 ( @entity70 84 ) ; @entity71 6.5 , @entity72 5.5 ( @entity73 59 6 ) , @entity3 5 unused subs : @entity75 ( @entity57 ) , @entity67 , @entity76 , @entity77 booked : @entity3 , @entity68 , @entity65 sent off : @entity3 referee : @entity10 6.5 attendance : 39,496 man of the match : @entity51 ( @entity26 ) click here to see all the stats , including @entity36 's hat map ( above ) , from @entity87 's brilliant @entity86 service on saturday , @entity3 was n't so lucky , getting a first yellow card for an attempted sliding tackle on @entity48 and a second for a foul on @entity44			1
' it was just two silly challenges , not malicious , ' said @entity93			0
' but at least the referee got that one right			0
' that was a pithy way of explaining he was less than happy with mr @entity10 for denying @entity8 penalties for a @entity100 challenge on @entity3 and an attempt by @entity48 to bring down @entity68			1
and he was furious that @entity13 stayed on the pitch for a high lunge on @entity69 early in the second half			1
' that was the biggest one			0
it 's impossible he stays on the football pitch for a challenge like that , ' said @entity93			2
i 've no clue why it was n't a red card			0
' i do n't want to see players surround referees			0
maybe we should because other teams would have done after the @entity13 challenge			1
10 v 10 is a lot easier than 10 v 11 and we would have fancied our chances			0
' predictably , @entity26 boss @entity124 had an opposite viewpoint			2
' i do n't think it was a red card at all			0
he stands on his feet in the challenge			0
it was well - controlled , ' he added before slightly contradicting himself			0
' it was a typical striker 's challenge			0
' @entity26 's on - loan winger @entity51 ( right ) is brought down in the box by @entity8 's @entity135 to win a penalty @entity137 international @entity36 places the ball on the penalty spot despite @entity47 being available the young @entity26 strikes the ball with conviction as @entity8 players race forward to clear any danger @entity36 strikes the ball low and to the left but @entity8 keeper @entity62 is equal to it with an excellent save @entity146 blows a sigh of relief after preventing @entity26 from taking the lead decisions aside , it was clear @entity26 were the better team on the pitch and deserved the victory given to them after 29 minutes when @entity154 dummied @entity44 's cross and @entity13 finished at the second attempt for his 10th goal of the season			1
they had already missed a penalty from @entity36 by that stage			1
@entity8 's @entity62 was by far the busier of the two goalkeepers and when the visitors had a late chance to equalise , it fell to out - of - sorts @entity71 who headed @entity63 's cross wide			1
@entity8 's brave battle against the drop is in danger of running out of steam , perhaps due to @entity93 's policy of naming unchanged teams			2
@entity175 's win leaves the @entity8 bottom of the table having scored only one goal in seven matches			1
they face @entity175 next weekend and it 's a must - win , if they been spurred on by the record - breaking test cricket achievements in the @entity185 of @entity8 fan @entity186 , it did n't show			2
after ten minutes , @entity135 pulled down @entity51 on the edge of the box and they both fell inside			2
@entity47 , whose @entity9 record from the spot is 15 out of 16 , did n't take it			2
@entity36 did and the effort was saved by @entity62 with @entity124 unconvincingly stating afterwards he applauded the youngster 's confidence for stepping up			1
at least it did n't deny @entity26 a win as @entity13 had done when he grabbed the ball of @entity47 against @entity199 in january and missed his penalty			1
' i was very pleased with the overall performance			0
the scoreline shows you a clean sheet and we had 20 attempts to score , ' said @entity124 whose side could still finish a moderate season in the top half of the table			0
@entity8 would bite your hand off at 17th and @entity93 still believes in the great escape			2
' i thought we were decent in the first half and excellent in the second when we were a man down			0
' @entity217 was booked for this studs - up challenge on @entity69 but the winger could have easily been shown a red card @entity26 boss @entity124 ( left ) and his @entity8 counterpart @entity93 watch their teams from the sidelines @entity13 mishit his initial shot before drilling the ball home from outside the box on 28minutes the @entity33 international was brought back into the @entity26 side following an injury to @entity231 @entity26 passed the ball around before an interception led to @entity13 opening the scoring - click here for all the game 's stats from our brilliant @entity86 service @entity13 wheels away after watching the ball into the net for @entity26 's opener on saturday the 27 - year - old raises his hand to acknowledge his goal as @entity26 supporters rise to their feet in the background @entity26 defender @entity44 ( left ) shakes hands with @entity13 to celebrate their opening goal @entity8 striker @entity71 drops to the ground after taking a knock as @entity26 take the lead @entity252 loanee @entity51 was named man of the match for an energetic performance @entity256 striker @entity3 ( left ) is given his marching orders for a second bookable offence @entity8 manager @entity93 does not look @entity3 ' way as the dejected forward trudges past him @entity8 defender @entity65 confronts referee @entity10 at half - time to question the sending off @entity26 keeper @entity43 ( left ) makes a save from @entity8 midfielder @entity10 @entity50 of @entity26 ( left ) battles for the ball with @entity8 's @entity73 ( centre ) goal scorer @entity13 is substituted for @entity54 after being fortunate not to be sent off @entity8 's @entity65 slides in to scythe down @entity36 of @entity26 towards the end of the game @entity71 screams in frustration after missing a rare opportunity to bring the visitors level			1

@entity26 defeated 10 - men @entity8 1 - 0 in their @entity9 clash at @entity31
@entity62 saved a penalty from @entity36 after @entity51 was fouled in the area
@entity13 scored the @entity26 ' winner with a drilled shot after initially *miskicking* the ball
@entity8 forward @entity3 was sent off for a second bookable offence on the stroke of half - time
@entity13 was fortunate to escape being dismissed for a high challenge on @entity69
