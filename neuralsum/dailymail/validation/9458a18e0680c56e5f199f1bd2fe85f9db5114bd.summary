@entity0 wrote to the author in 1980 asking him to look at a short story he had written a brutally honest letter written by @entity4 to a teenager who asked him for advice on his a-level project has surfaced			1
budding writer @entity0 wrote to the author in 1980 asking him to look at a short story he had written			1
the 17 - year - old did not expect a reply			1
but mr @entity0 , who grew up near @entity12 , was delighted when he received a typed note signed by the man himself			1
however , in true @entity4 style , there was a sting in the tail			1
however the letter was not what the eager teenager had expected with @entity4 heavily criticising his use of ' beastly adjectives '			1
the correspondence read : ' @entity26 , you are asking too much of me			0
you must realise i get an awful lot of these letters and you ca n't expect me to write your thesis for you			0
' it should be fairly obvious to you what the role of a short story is in modern literature			1
it 's a big one			0
' study particularly the @entity38 short story writers like @entity39 and @entity40 and @entity41 and @entity42 , and lots and lots of @entity46 ones			1
' if you want any dope on me there have been an awful lot of profiles in @entity46 magazines over the past year starting with the february 1979 edition of @entity54			2
' i have read your story			2
i do n't think it 's bad , but you must stop using too many adjectives			0
@entity4 responded saying the teenager was ' asking too much , ' but that said that he had read his story ' @entity62 , particularly his early work and learn how to write short sentences and how to eschew all those beastly adjectives			1
' surely it is better to say ' she was a tall girl with a bosom ' than ' she was a tall girl with a shapely , prominent bosom ' , or some such rubbish			0
the first one says it all			0
' @entity26 , who now lives in @entity73 , recently found the letter while going through old boxes and posted a picture on @entity77			0
the image was posted alongside the caption : ' in 1980 , as a spotty teenager , i wrote to @entity4 asking for advice on writing			2
here is his priceless response			0
' amazingly it has now been re-tweeted more than 1,700 times and has been favourited by almost 2,400 people			0
@entity26 , who set up @entity90 company 72point , said : ' as a callow youth , i was expecting him to tell me how marvellous the story was , and offer to introduce me to his publisher			0
mr @entity0 in his teens , left , and the celebrated author @entity4 , right , who replied to his letter ' instead he gave me this fairly forthright criticism			1
' the story was for an @entity100 project , and was probably really self - indulgent , overflowing with flowery adjectives , which @entity4 quite rightly bristled at			1
' after considering his advice , i have to admit it was probably fair and i 've taken heed of it ever since			0
' i was a big fan of @entity4 's short stories aimed at adults , like @entity108			2
i loved their dark elements , the twist in the tale			0
' @entity4 's advice has informed whatever writing style i have had since , especially in news reporting			2
