@entity0 will demand the power to hold another independence referendum in return for propping up @entity4 in @entity5 next year			1
the outgoing first minister has revealed his price for the @entity10 's support should there be a hung parliament following may 's general election			1
the move raises the prospect of mr @entity4 facing the unenviable choice of running a majority government or risking another vote on the future of the @entity19			1
as his ' divisive ' reign comes to an end , @entity27 secretary @entity26 has called on his successor @entity30 to ' hit the reset button ' and fix the relationship between @entity33 and @entity34			1
mr @entity26 blasted the @entity35 for ' taking its eye off the ball ' in recent years and urged ministers to focus on their ' day jobs ' now that voters have rejected separation			1
he also singled out education secretary @entity42 for failing to ' respect ' the result of the referendum after the minister blamed a fall in teacher numbers on those who support the @entity19			1
but mr @entity0 , 59 , used a press conference yesterday to insist that independence will happen within his own lifetime			0
he also backtracked from his pre-referendum vow that september 's contest was a ' once in a generation , perhaps even a lifetime , opportunity ' and said another referendum could happen ' sooner ' than @entity60 supporters would like			2
his comments will alarm more than 2million @entity27 who turned out to reject independence , many of whom are still recovering from the divisions caused by the constitutional battle			0
mr @entity0 is widely expected to launch a bid to return to @entity33 as an mp once he hands over power to @entity71 , where he hopes to be ' kingmaker ' following next year 's general election			0
in an interview with @entity77 to be published tomorrow , the @entity10 leader suggests he would also fight for voters in northern @entity79			2
' who knows , there might be one or two things we can knock off for the good citizens of @entity85 and @entity86 , because they badly need a champion of some sort , ' he said			0
' is @entity79 going to be safer in my hands or in the hands of this coalition government or of @entity93 ? much safer in my hands			2
i 'll do my best			0
' @entity4 has seen a collapse in support for @entity96 in @entity27 , with voters switching to the @entity10 the @entity10 will not enter a formal coalition with the @entity99 , but has not ruled out a deal with @entity96			1
however , should the arithmetic allow it , a ' confidence and supply ' system is more likely where the party 's mps would vote against any no confidence vote in a @entity96 - led government and would allow its budget to pass			0
' there is plenty of scope to find things which are really important to you but are really not that important to the government , ' he told @entity77			0
' it would n't be the greatest tragedy in the world , for example , for @entity33 to accept the reality that the @entity27 parliament should run its own elections , its own referendum			2
' elections are currently reserved to @entity33 and the recent referendum was only made legally - binding following a temporary deal between @entity129 and mr @entity0			0
the first minister claimed the threat to the @entity19 by handing over this power would not be of ' immediate pressing concern [ to @entity33 ] compared to the enormity , for example , of @entity4 's survival as prime minister , which i am sure he would in that situation believe to be of the ultimate importance to the future of everything			1
' last night , a senior @entity96 mp said the idea was a non-starter because there would be no mandate to devolve elections and it would be ' going against the settled will of the @entity27 voters '			0
mr @entity26 said it is time to leave the constitutional debate behind			1
' for us all in politics , there 's a job of work to be done now to move @entity27 on from being divided between the 55 [ per cent who voted @entity159 ] and the 45 , to heal some of the deep and quite understandable divisions that there were in the course of the referendum , ' he said			0
' with @entity30 taking over the reins as @entity10 leader and then as first minister next week â€¦ i hope that this will be a point when we can hit the reset button on the relationship between the two governments			1
' mr @entity26 criticised comments made by the first minister about the prospect of another referendum on independence			1
' i 'm hoping that once some of the dust settles that they will accept that we 're not returning to the referendum question any time soon , because principally that would be very bad for @entity27 's economy , ' he said			2
but during a press conference in his official @entity187 residence yesterday , mr @entity0 said : ' it 's the people who decide whether a constitutional referendum should be held			0
' i did see a number of indications in two polls last week that at least there is strong support among the people of @entity27 for a constitutional referendum rather sooner			2
' asked if he thought independence would happen within his lifetime , he replied : ' yes indeed			0
