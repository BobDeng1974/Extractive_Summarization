@entity0 was a long way from being even a glint in @entity4 ’s eye the last time he faced @entity5 in a @entity6			1
so much has changed for both players since the historic 2013 @entity9 final , including the arrival of new faces in their coaching boxes — two former sw19 champions			1
@entity0 is on one side and @entity15 the other , while the @entity16 of player support benches , @entity18 , has departed to spend more time with his golf clubs and tennis academy			2
while not as stone - faced as @entity18 , the phlegmatic @entity41 has adopted a stoic presence courtside , even when the 27 - year - old @entity43 is letting off steam by ranting in her direction			0
it will be a new experience for her , if one that every one of his coaches has gone through before , even @entity18 on very rare occasions			0
@entity50 does not benefit from such behaviour , although in monday ’s gruelling win over @entity53 it seemed to energise him to fight back			0
@entity0 takes a markedly different view to @entity18 , who said he would leave if @entity4 mouthed off to him in matches			1
reflecting on how she handles @entity4 ’s sporadic on - court rages she said : ‘ i stay calm , i observe			1
i look at him a lot , see how he reacts to different moments in the match , to different things that are happening on the court , how he then reacts after he is getting vocal or whatever			0
sometimes i like it , sometimes less			0
we are all different , and the idea is to find what suits you the best			0
' i am not sure he got angry , he just pumps himself up in this way			0
i stay calm almost all the time , but he knows we are there for him , always behind him			0
’ in some parts of the equality - obsessed @entity76 media @entity4 is hailed as a hero for hiring a woman , although he has always maintained it was purely about finding the best person to suit him , which happened to be @entity0			1
flying colours : @entity4 sailed through a tricky looking match against @entity53 in the fourth round battle : @entity4 has been troubled a few times on his way to the last eight in @entity76 @entity15 admits he was ‘ a little surprised ’ at @entity4 hiring @entity0 , but described the 2006 @entity9 champion as a ‘ very intelligent and pleasant woman who knows the game very well ’			1
‘ the collaboration with @entity94 ( @entity95 , his assistant coach ) seemed to be working very well at the @entity96 but something obviously was n’t working quite right for @entity4 or he would n’t have appointed her , ’ said the @entity92			2
regardless of that , @entity4 is second favourite against the man who two months ago deposed him as @entity9 champion			1
one reason is their matches tend to be very arduous and @entity5 has spent three and half hours less time on court in getting this far			2
dream team : @entity5 receives some advice from his coach @entity15 at @entity113 memory : @entity4 defeated @entity5 in the 2013 @entity9 final on a historic afternoon in @entity116 ‘ if you do want to win the tournament you want to spend as little time as possible on the early rounds , ’ said @entity15			1
‘ i am very pleased @entity5 has won his matches quickly			2
he and @entity4 are chess players on the tennis court and that is why they tend to have marathon matches			2
’ @entity5 has beaten @entity4 in four of their last five meetings , that heady afternoon at the @entity128 being the exception , although two years ago @entity4 overcame him in this @entity130 to claim his first @entity6			1
and with the way things have gone this season the pressure is all on the @entity38 , which ought to allow the @entity134 no 1 to hit freely , and he must ensure that his vulnerable second serve does not end up getting treated like a punchbag			0
@entity15 is part of the @entity139 team covering the @entity26 .			0

@entity4 takes on @entity5 in @entity26 quarter - final
@entity143 won last meeting in a @entity6 , the 2013 @entity9 final
@entity5 holds a 12 - 8 head - to - head advantage , including four of last five
@entity0 set for biggest match since becoming @entity4 's coach
