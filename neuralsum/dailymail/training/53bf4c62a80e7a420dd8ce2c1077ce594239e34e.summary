the council said the slide can only be used for two hours a day due to the tide but the announcement was not received well by officers from @entity72 , who confirmed they are investigating as the 20 - acre island is in an area of outstanding natural beauty			1
councillor @entity78 said : ‘ i have been told that the slide can only be used a couple of hours a day due to the tide			1
‘ however , i do n’t believe you should be allowed to erect a slide in an area of outstanding natural beauty such as @entity22 ’s before going through correct procedures			2
i am concerned that an accident could happen , since there have been no discussions with planning or the health and safety department of @entity72			1
’ @entity6 has submitted an application to build a £ 580,000 harbour at @entity22 ’s @entity21 to improve access			0
