the parrot ... a bird better known for its comical ability to copy someone 's voice than its beautiful sound			2
because these @entity6 boast some of the best sound quality this side of @entity10 , transforming your ears into a dance floor one minute , or concert auditorium the next			0
indeed , they are sure to appeal to music lovers of all tastes and ages , their understated but substantial design likely to hit the right note across the age spectrum			1
ear we go ! these @entity23 boast fantastic sound quality and look stunning , too everything about these @entity26 oozes quality			1
the box itself would n't look out of place in the @entity31			0
the headphones , although a bit on the heavy side , are works of art , too			1
they fit snugly around your ears , and reduce outside noise to a minimum			0
the clever thing about the @entity26 is that they are wireless - connecting via @entity44			1
plus , with their ' @entity46 ' technology , you can sync and pair portable music players by touch ( in much the same way an oyster card works )			1
using a touch - sensitive pad on the left ear , you can turn the volume up and down and even skip songs			1
in theory this sounds great , but does n't work quite as well as i hoped ... especially on public transport			0
i got a few strange looks from fellow commuters who watched me tap manically on my ear to try and turn the volume down			0
in the gym , too , the rather fiddly touch - sensitive mechanism often causes you to skip songs accidentally or blast your ears into oblivion when you mistakenly crank up the volume			1
bird of pray : you 'll worship the headphones ' design a touch of genius , though , is their ability to pause music when you take them away from your ears , so you can bid farewell to having to stop mid conversation to turn off the tinny background noise emanating from your headphones			1
the sound quality is superb			0
at both low and high volume , depth of sound is fantastic , great for those who are weary of damaging their ears			0
for those who are n't , no fret			0
at full blast the @entity26 are a joy , too			0
just be careful ... but all these positives come at a price , with these beauties retailing for a hefty Â£ 349			2
the idea of touch - sensitive earphones is a master stroke , and it 's the main reason you 'll snap up one of these			1
however , the system needs more refining to elevate it from cool gadget to game - changer			2
for those after statement style and sound that will blow your mind , though , these @entity23 are worth every penny			2
follow @entity109 on @entity110 : @ @entity111 and on @entity112 : @entity113 .			0

oozes class and style , from the packaging to the *sleek* headphone design
wireless works through @entity44 and can connect to other music players just by touching them
touch - sensitive mechanism can be fiddly and price may put *people* off
quite heavy on the head , too
