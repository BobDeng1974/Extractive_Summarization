for just a moment it looked as if the brilliance that had earned @entity3 a place in the record books at the halfway point of the 114th @entity7 was about to unravel			1
becoming the first man to open a major championship with two rounds of 65 suddenly appeared more than 24 hours ago			0
now he was staring down a 15ft putt for a bogey at the fourth			0
@entity17 it and he would have been three over par at that early stage , and his six shot lead would have been halved after less than an hour ’s play			1
top dog : @entity3 ( right ) takes a five shot lead going into the final round of the @entity22 on sunday mixed bag : @entity3 shot a wobbly round of 72 at @entity25 to be leading on eight - under - par overall @entity28 landing : @entity3 's indifferent round including landing in a greenside bunker on the tenth hole eyes on the prize : @entity3 is trying to become the first man to win a major with two opening rounds of 65 what followed , though , proved the start of 15 minutes of sheer guts and class that kept the 29 - year - old from @entity41 firmly on course to claim his second major championship , following his win in the @entity45 in 2010			1
the putt , like so many over the first 36 holes , was drained , to be followed by an approach to the par five 5th that might well prove the shot of the championship			2
from the ‘ native area ’ just off the fairway to the left , @entity3 played a long iron so precise it pitched on the only sliver of green available for it to finish close to the flag , and he holed the ensuing six - footer for a fabulous eagle three			1
drained : @entity61 leads the chasing pack on three - under - par overall at @entity25 comeback king : @entity61 ( right ) has had to deal with two heart transplants during his career in the thick of it : @entity68 ( centre ) is tied with @entity61 on the leaderboard going into the final round there is still work to do today , though , thanks to the spirited efforts of @entity68 and @entity61 but @entity3 ’s last shot of the third round looked significant			1
a fine approach was followed by a confident six foot birdie putt for a 72 that stretched his lead back to five shots going into the final round			1
‘ i did n’t play as well as i did the first two days but the pins were in more difficult positions as well , ’ said @entity3			2
‘ i ’m obviously pleased with my position , but i know the tournament is far from won			0
’ is there a more remarkable athlete in sport than @entity61 ? there ’s certainly not a more remarkable golfer			2
do n’t talk to the 34 - year - old about adversity on the course			0
he ’s known plenty off it after undergoing not one but two heart transplants but here he is , with a chance to win his national championship after a 67			0
deposed champion : @entity103 has admitted he will be handing over his @entity22 title this year @entity68 , who grew up idolising @entity105 who won here in 1999 and donned plus fours as a tribute on day one , is on the same three under par mark after a 67 of his own , while the dangerous @entity110 will start six shots off the lead , alongside @entity113			1
defending champion @entity103 accepted he was handing the trophy after a round of 70			0
it ’s been a decent defence nonetheless , although he was irritated by failing to get up and down on three occasions and staining his card with a three - putt			0
he was still the best of a disappointing @entity122 challenge , though , in tied tenth spot with @entity124 and @entity125 unable to get into contention following rounds of 74			1
@entity129 teenager @entity128 was another to suffer in the more difficult conditions as he ran up a 78 but today will be a memorable one for him regardless			2
his final day in the non-paid ranks will conclude with him being presented with the silver medal as low amateur			1
frustrated figure : @entity124 watches on as he misses a putt for birdie on the 12th green at @entity25 it completes quite a collection for the gilded 19 - year - old , since he can place it next to a similar medal he won at the @entity7 at @entity142 last year , and the trophy he collected for becoming @entity145 ’s first @entity144 for more than a century last august			1
and so the real world awaits , and it will be fascinating to see how the most feted @entity122 amateur since a tender @entity103 in 1998 gets on			0
@entity149 , of course , earned similar status as the apple of the golfing world ’s eye when he turned pro after finishing fourth at the @entity7 at @entity156			0
he promptly went on a downward spiral that saw him miss 21 halfway cuts in a row			0
cool customer : swede @entity110 is six shots behind @entity3 on two - under - par overall so who better than @entity149 to consult about the pitfalls facing @entity165 , in his attempts to justify the hype ? the pair played together for the first two rounds here , and @entity149 was as impressed as anyone at the manner in which @entity165 coped with the clamour of playing with @entity173 to become the only amateur to make the halfway cut			1
‘ i have talked to @entity128 about what lies ahead and i hope he learns from my own experience because he ’s a great lad and a wonderful player , ’ said @entity149			2
‘ it is very easy to get distracted thinking you need to get your @entity182 card or your @entity184 card or get your world ranking to such and such position			0
‘ when you do that you ’re just heaping pressure on yourself and i ’m sure @entity128 will not make that mistake			2
turning pro is a huge step for anyone , though			0
i do n’t think you ’re ever 100 per cent ready because at the end of the day it is a process to get better year on year for the next 20 years for him			0
that ’s what you have to focus on			0
’ young gun : @entity128 will be presented with the silver medal as low amateur on sunday @entity165 ’s first event will be the @entity201 which starts on thursday and may well prove a wise place to make his debut , since much of the spotlight will inevitably fall on returning heroes like @entity124 and @entity206			1
first , though , the @entity22 presentation ceremony , where it looks for all the world like being an @entity145 - @entity210 affair .			1

@entity3 has a five shot lead going into the final round of the @entity22 on sunday
@entity3 shot an up - and - down round of 72 at @entity25
@entity61 and @entity68 lead the chasing pack on three - under - par
@entity124 tied tenth in the leaderboard
@entity128 will finish with the silver medal as low amateur
