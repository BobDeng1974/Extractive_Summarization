@entity0 has been taken out of the line of fire by @entity3 , who will rest the defender who was accused of diving for tuesday night 's @entity7 quarter - final at @entity8			1
@entity12 boss @entity11 accused @entity0 of simulation - ' like something out of @entity15 ' , the @entity10 boss said - following @entity17 's 2 - 0 win at @entity18 on saturday			1
@entity11 felt @entity0 should have been shown a second yellow card			1
the @entity21 centre - back will be replaced by @entity22 for the trip to @entity8 , even though @entity24 manager @entity3 has vowed to field ' the best possible team '			1
@entity0 escaped a second booking against @entity12 despite this dive which caused controversy @entity12 manager @entity11 claimed @entity0 's dive was ' like something out of @entity15 ' @entity3 insists he is resting his centre - back because he played him against @entity33 last week ' we 're going to play against a top team in the @entity36 , ' @entity3 told @entity37			1
' the difference between a top team in the @entity36 and the teams of the @entity41 are very , very small			2
we played there last year and it was not an easy game			0
' we have no reason to rest people			0
the only one that is not going because he played against @entity33 ( @entity33 ) - i never gave him a break - is @entity0			1
' @entity0 does n't play , i play @entity22			1
' it is a decision which may have been taken ahead of the diving storm when @entity17 had @entity54 and @entity55 booked for simulation			0
@entity0 is due a rest as he was not one of the six players switched out of the side for last week 's @entity62 match with @entity33			1
two @entity17 players , @entity54 ( above ) and @entity55 , were booked for diving during saturday 's win @entity66 defender @entity22 will replace @entity0 for the @entity7 clash against @entity8 on tuesday night but the timing is convenient for @entity3 , who last season lambasted @entity69 for an ' acrobatic swimming pool jump ' as he railed against simulation in @entity73 football			1
he also insisted ' there are no divers at @entity17 ' following @entity77 's booking for simulation at @entity79 on january 1			2
prior to the @entity12 contest , @entity3 insisted none of his players would be ever - presents over the congested @entity84 schedule			1
the @entity8 match is @entity17 's fourth fixture of december and they now play six games in 19 days until their @entity89 third - round tie with @entity90 on january 4			1
' i do n't think one player is going to play these six matches , ' @entity3 said			0
' every one of them has to go to five , the ones that play more they have to go to five ; one ( game ) rest i think i have to give them			0
' we did that against @entity33 , we gave a rest to some players and we 're going to do this from now until the end of the month			0
' @entity17 boss @entity3 will give his players a couple of days off this week ahead of the @entity84 period @entity3 will afford his players rest following the @entity8 match , with @entity17 's next game the @entity41 contest at @entity110 next monday			1
' we have two days off , which is the two days after @entity8 , which allows the players to go home , ' @entity3 added			1
' maybe not , for sure , the @entity121 ones , because it 's very far , but the ones around @entity73 , @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity119 , two days off ; they have the chance at least to go and have a nice dinner with their families			0
' it 's the only two days i can give them			0
we play tuesday against @entity8 , i give them wednesday and thursday , after that they are back friday to play monday			2
' goalkeeper @entity128 is unlikely to be risked after missing the @entity41 leaders ' win over @entity12 with a minor muscular injury , so @entity132 is poised to continue in goal			2
@entity132 is likely to stay in goal for the @entity8 clash with @entity128 having missed saturday 's win playmaker @entity137 is available following suspension but @entity140 midfielder @entity139 is not yet ready to start following a groin problem			2
' @entity139 is being a champion , fantastic professional , step by step , working hard , always available for the team , ' @entity3 added			0
' he 's in trouble			0
he 's not ready to start a game			0
he comes to the bench and every time we can we give him a little bit ( more )			0
' @entity17 won 2 - 0 at @entity8 's @entity149 last season in the third round of the @entity89 and will next face familiar opposition in the @entity62 , too			2
the @entity24 were drawn against @entity153 in the last 16 , with the first leg at the @entity155 on february 17 and the return on march 11			0
it sees @entity158 reunited with @entity17 , who edged last season 's quarter - final on away goals .			0
