by @entity0 shipping containers could be used as temporary accommodation for homeless people to help solve a city 's housing crisis			1
a housing trust in @entity7 wants to use the 36 adapted containers as a stop - gap for people without a permanent home			1
it is the latest plan aimed at tackling @entity7 and @entity14 's ' desperate ' housing crisis			1
the structures were designed for a social housing project in @entity29 two years ago but the scheme had to be abandoned after hitting funding difficulties			0
it is hoped they will instead be used as temporary homes in @entity7 and @entity14 from late spring next year until a permanent roof can be found			1
the @entity36 and developer @entity37 are to submit a planning application to the local city council for a central site featuring the modified containers with allotments on the roofs			2
@entity45 , chief executive of @entity36 , said ' imaginative solutions ' were needed to deal with the ' desperate ' housing situation in the city			0
concern : @entity7 and @entity14 authorities recognise homelessness is a serious problem in the city			1
some 43 rough sleepers were counted there this month ( file picture ) shipping - container homes have been used elsewhere , including in @entity21 , and are seen as a significantly cheaper housing option than bricks and mortar			2
the plans in @entity7 follow a warning from leading housing bodies this month that homelessness and overcrowding are getting worse amid @entity19 ’s housing shortage			1
high property prices averaging around £ 302,000 , steep private rents and low average wages in the seaside city have contributed to high levels of homelessness the problems come against a background of rising private sector rents and as more people are claiming housing benefit nationwide , a report by @entity73 , the @entity74 and the @entity75 said			1
mr @entity45 said : ' i have to admit that when it was first suggested to me that shipping containers be used for housing i was a bit sceptical			2
' however , having seen what can be achieved , i was quickly won over			0
the @entity88 and shower unit is exactly the same as my daughter had in her student accommodation and she much preferred it to having to share bathrooms and toilets with other students			0
who would n’t ? ' what really excites me about this opportunity is that land that might otherwise lie idle for five years will be brought back into life and used to provide much - needed temporary accommodation for 36 men and women in @entity7 and @entity14			1
' unusual : 36 shipping containers , similar to these pictured , have already been converted into studio flats complete with bathrooms and kitchens excited : @entity45 , chief executive of @entity110 , said ' imaginative ' solutions are needed to solve housing crisis when the site comes to be redeveloped , the containers can be transferred to other locations			1
mr @entity45 added : ' this appears to me to be very attractive from a sustainability perspective			0
' shelter chief executive @entity119 said the government ' simply is n’t delivering the new homes we need '			0
and @entity123 , chief executive of the @entity74 , said there had been ' “ words and policy ' but ' we ’ve not had delivery '			0
in @entity7 and @entity14 , the authorities recognise homelessness as a significant problem , with 43 people found sleeping rough during an annual headcount this month , up six from the previous year			1
mr @entity45 highlighted the case of one man who was living in his car and holding down a job			0
he said he would not want to see the shipping containers used as a long - term housing option here , but there are examples in mainland @entity142			2
' the most notable project is in @entity144 , @entity29 , a development by @entity146 , of 1,000 containers using exactly the same internal design layout as the ones we are proposing to use			0
it was completed in 2006 and is still in use today , ' he said			0
@entity37 director @entity152 told local newspaper @entity153 : ' we ’re not intending to dress them up and pretend they ’re not containers			2
' i think it could be an exciting way of addressing , quickly , what ’s a massive problem			0
