by @entity1 reporter a coroner has demanded to know how an 88 - year - old grandmother was allowed to starve to death in a care home			1
@entity6 , who worked as a bus conductress during the @entity8 , was reduced to an ‘ emaciated skeleton ’ after care home staff failed to check she was eating properly			2
when she finally died of severe malnutrition , she weighed just 4st 12lb – the weight of a seven - year - old child			1
coroner @entity14 said he was so horrified to hear what happened to mrs @entity6 , that he is to write to the local health authorities and even the police to raise his concerns			1
@entity19 ( pictured in 2003 with her great grandaughter @entity20 ) weighed less than five stone at the time of her death and was described as looking like a ' skeleton with skin pulled over ' despite being in a care home and categorised as ' high risk ' the inquest heard that doctors who saw mrs @entity19 at hospital before she died ' could n’t believe that she had come from a care home '			1
now her daughter @entity32 has hit out at her care at @entity34 in @entity35 , @entity36 , saying ' we were let down			1
no one should die of malnutrition in modern - day @entity40			1
' the inquest heard that the @entity44 bus conductor and grandmother had ' slipped through the net ' , after staff at the nursing home failed to carry out appropriate record keeping for almost a month in the lead up to her death in september 2009 and a review by her dietitian had failed to take place			1
@entity19 as a bus conductor during @entity8 one doctor at the hospital said that medical help should have been sought sooner , whilst the pathologist said she had ' looked like a skeleton ' with a @entity61 of just 13			1
@entity63 dr @entity62 said : ' she looked like a skeleton so i ’m not surprised about her low weight , she was extremely malnourished			1
' she should have had medical intervention , there was n’t enough care			2
' she was well underweight			2
it is impossible to gauge the time scale that dehydration had occurred			0
' mrs @entity6 had been a resident at the home since november 2008 after a series of mini strokes and problems arising surrounding weight loss caused her to be hospitalised			1
when she was discharged , she was initially expected to stay in the care home for one month but ended up remaining because she had shown improvements in her health and eating and put on just under a stone ( 6 kg )			1
the inquest heard that she was categorised as ' high risk ' and needed her weight to be continually monitored , but over the next six months her weight dropped			1
her daughter , @entity32 , 66 , giving evidence , said that she had visited her elderly mother regularly and four days before her death in september 2009 , had noted that she was becoming more frail			1
she also raised concerns that the care home was not keeping records up - to - date which was brought to the attention of the coroner , @entity14			2
an investigation by @entity97 after her death found that @entity98 had ' fulfilled all their requirements '			0
@entity101 @entity100 had told the hearing that he ' did n’t feel there were any grave concerns about the medical staff or medical providers ' and that ' all documentation completed was of higher than average standard			0
' but coroner mr @entity14 hit out at the care home ’s record keeping and @entity97 after it was found that there were no care records from august 10 , 2009 - bar a report on august 16 , 2009 , that referred to a slight weight gain			1
@entity119 ' daughter @entity32 ( pictured ) said that she is still looking for answers as to why her mother died : ' i still want to know how this happened , i think that when the coroner said she fell through the net he was right			1
i still have reservations about what happened in the days leading up to her death ' mrs @entity32 said : ' she went in a lot better health than what she was in the end			1
i assume if somebody needs care then they are given it			0
' i ca n’t believe that a care home would leave someone in such a state without water and not admit her to hospital			2
it is inconceivable that that would happen and also not to advise me how bad she was			0
' @entity6 on her @entity143 in 1947 dr @entity144 said that when the grandmother arrived at @entity146 she was dehydrated and ' did n’t have any more weight to lose '			1
' she was chronically underweight			0
the deceased did n’t have any more weight to lose			1
the nursing staff ( at the hospital ) were concerned with the poor physical state she was in			2
' mrs @entity6 ’s health failed to improve and she died the following day			1
dr @entity144 added that she had been ' surprised ' the hospital staff had n’t seen mrs @entity156 before , adding : ' she was very very unwell , but deterioration can be very rapid			1
she ca n’t have drank for a couple of days			0
i do believe they should have sought medical help sooner			0
' area care home manager for @entity34 , @entity163 said : ' any concerns a home has about weight or diet are referred to the outside professionals			1
' the home did pass on the concerns to the outside services			0
' it was evident that @entity6 was seen regularly by external professionals and at no time prior to her death did the external professionals raise concerns about the care provided by the home and was not considered to be at risk			2
' the staff at the home regularly encouraged her to eat and take in more fluids , this is confirmed from her notes			0
whilst the home would raise any necessary concerns to her well being , it was ultimately for the visiting nurses , gp , district nurses and community dietician to administer			0
' she said that she accepted that records should have contained entries on a weekly basis and accepted that it was good practice to chase up any outside assessments			0
community staff nurse with @entity198 , @entity199 had implemented a care plan for mrs @entity6 because she was at risk of malnutrition			1
she said that she had expected that the staff at the care home would carry out weekly weigh ins , record the weight and liaise with the dietician adding that this was ' very important '			2
mrs @entity19 ( centre , with her daughter @entity210 , left ) had been a resident at the home since november 2008 after a series of mini strokes and problems arising surrounding weight loss had caused her to be admitted to hospital returning a narrative verdict mr @entity14 said : ' in march 2009 her weight was 38.4 kilos , in may 35kg , august 33kg and at post mortem 31kg			1
these figures demonstrate a loss of over 10 per cent over a period of six months			0
' it was imperative that her weight was maintained			2
' overall there were no concerns over the care of mrs @entity6 prior to august 10 but the relevant records thereafter simply do not exist			2
' the cause of death by the doctor was malnutrition which is an extremely rare cause of death			2
' record keeping is a major concern both within the acute setting and case homes			0
if it is not there it has n’t taken place , it is as simple as that			0
there is no explanation of the absence of appropriate record keeping			0
' i also have concerns about the vulnerable adult section compiled by the @entity97 about the completion of the care home records			0
it is supposed to evaluate the quality of the records provided by the care establishment			0
mrs @entity32 ( pictured with her husband outside @entity256 ) said : ' there was no way this happened overnight			2
i could n't believe how she looked when i saw her that morning at the home , she was totally emaciated ' ' it was suggested that there was nothing untoward			0
having seen the actual records i do not share that evaluation and i will be writing to @entity97 to express my concerns			0
' i am also extremely concerned and have had communication with @entity198 that she did n’t have another dietary review			0
' she died of malnutrition which more than likely was caused by a combination of naturally occurring disease			1
' speaking after the inquest mrs @entity32 , a retired export administrator , said that she was still looking for answers as to why her mother died			1
the coroner said that he had concerns about record keeping at @entity34 in @entity35 , where mrs @entity119 starved she said : ' i still want to know how this happened , i think that when the coroner said she fell through the net he was right			1
i still have reservations about what happened in the days leading up to her death			0
' i know what she looked like when she went into hospital			2
if you imagine a skeleton with skin pulled over it , that was what she looked like			0
' there was no way this happened overnight			0
i could n’t believe how she looked when i saw her that morning at the home , she was totally emaciated			0
i would have liked to have known what she weighed at that stage before they pumped her full of fluid but they could n’t weigh her			0
i have never seen anything like it			0
' you do n’t expect someone in this country to die of malnutrition it ’s a third world problem , yet it happened			2

grandmother @entity317 , 88 , died a day after she was admitted to hospital for severe malnutrition in 2009
she moved into @entity34 in 2008 after series of strokes and developing condition that caused her to lose weight easily
was marked as a ' high - risk ' *patient* but her *declining* health was not *flagged* up until mrs @entity119 ' health had become *critical*
