by @entity0 @entity1 claims the @entity2 has put him on his final warning for ' appearing ' to use the n - word in unaired @entity6 footage - and he will be sacked if he ever makes an offensive remark again			1
the 54 - year - old admitted ' not even the angel gabriel ' could survive after the threat - especially not a presenter renowned for controversy			1
and despite begging for forgiveness less than two days ago for the clip of him saying the nursery rhyme @entity16 , @entity1 also claimed the @entity2 had forced him to apologise and he did not want to			1
' i 've been told by the @entity2 that if i make one more offensive remark , anywhere , at any time , i will be sacked , ' he wrote			1
' and even the angel @entity42 would struggle to survive with that hanging over his head			0
' it 's inevitable that one day , someone , somewhere will say that i 've offended them , and that will be that			2
' he also wrote : ' happily , the @entity2 had a plan			1
unfortunately , it was n't a very good one			1
' an apology is a good idea if you 've just spilled some beer down someone 's shirt ... but saying sorry for using the most racist word of them all , and hoping the story would die down as a result ? ' the pressure to apologise even went against the advice of his own lawyer , he claimed			1
a solemn - looking @entity1 said the item was recorded a ' couple of years ago ' and said he ' did everything in my power to make sure that that version did not appear in the programme that was transmitted ' eventually , he said , he agreed to say sorry and insisted that when he did , he meant it from the heart			0
in his weekly column the presenter added he had ' become @entity78 ' and was being attacked by people calling for him to join sex offender @entity81 in jail			2
the star became embroiled in controversy after unaired footage of him using the nursery rhyme to compare two sports cars was leaked to the media			2
historically the rhyme was ' eeny meeny miny mo , catch a n * * * * * by his toe ' , and @entity1 said he ' mumbled ' in two takes to avoid using the racist term - which made it sound like he was saying it			2
in the third , which was broadcast , he said the word ' teacher ' instead			2
an online petition calling for the @entity2 presenter to be sacked has reached more than 1,000 signatures			1
intervention : deputy labour leader @entity102 ( left ) has called for the @entity2 to sack @entity1 over his so - called use of the ' n - word ' but education secretary @entity105 ( right ) has urged him to be kept labour figures including deputy leader @entity102 also demanded he should be sacked			1
' anybody who uses the n - word in public or private in whatever context has no place in the @entity2 , ' she wrote on @entity111			1
and @entity113 mp @entity112 wrote : ' @entity1 announces he has one last chance			0
he 's been in that saloon so long now he must be hammered			1
' but education secretary @entity105 urged the @entity2 not to axe @entity1 because he had been ' clear in his apology '			1
and the prime minister appeared to agree			0
mr @entity119 's official spokesman said : ' he does share the @entity105 's view : it is absolutely right that there has been an apology			1
' pressed on whether he also shared the view he should keep his job , he replied : ' his view is that in terms of actions and the like , that 's for the @entity2			1
' denial : the @entity2 presenter 's first tweet immediately after the storm broke earlier this week row : former newspaper editor @entity133 has tweeted regularly about a man who is often his nemesis in his video apology - which he said took hours to complete because he could not remember his @entity111 password - @entity1 said he ' did everything in my power to not use that word '			1
he added he was now ' begging your forgiveness for the fact that obviously my efforts were n't quite good enough '			1
' i was mortified by this , horrified			0
it is a word i loathe , ' he said			2
controversy : the @entity6 presenter is regularly accused of being offensive the @entity2 previously said it had ' left him in no doubt about how seriously we view this '			1
the claims come days after the motoring show 's producer apologised for broadcasting a ' light - hearted ' joke by @entity1 that sparked a complaint of racism			2
an episode filmed in @entity162 and @entity163 featured a scene in which the presenters built a bridge over the @entity167 , and as an @entity169 man walked over it @entity1 said : ' that is a proud moment , but there 's a slope on it			2
' @entity174 , an actress who complained to the @entity2 , said the use of the word ' slope ' was an example of ' casual racism ' and ' gross misconduct '			1
in recent years @entity1 has been cleared of breaching the broadcasting code by watchdog @entity182 after comparing a @entity184 car to people with growths on their faces			0
he previously faced a storm of protest from mental health charities after he branded people who throw themselves under trains as ' selfish ' and was forced to apologise for telling @entity193 's @entity192 that striking workers should be shot			0
the motoring show has also faced complaints from @entity198 and @entity199 politicians over remarks made about their countries while filming on location			0
a @entity2 spokesman told @entity204 today : ' we have nothing to add to the statement issued on thursday			1
' that statement said : ' @entity1 has set out the background to this regrettable episode			0
' we have made it absolutely clear to him , the standards the @entity2 expects on air and off			2
' we have left him in no doubt about how seriously we view this			0
' ' ordinarily i do n't respond to newspaper allegations , but on this occasion i feel i must make an exception			0
' a couple of years ago i recorded an item for @entity6 , in which i quoted the rhyme @entity221 , @entity223 , @entity224			0
' now , of course , i was well aware that in the best known version of this rhyme , there is a racist expression that i was extremely keen to avoid			0
' the full rushes show that i did three takes			0
' in two i mumbled where the offensive word would normally occur and in the third , i replaced it all together with the word " teacher "			0
' now when i viewed this footage , several weeks later , i realised that in one of the mumbled versions , if you listen very carefully with the sound turned right up , it did appear that i 'd actually used the word i was trying to obscure			0
' i was mortified by this , horrified , it is a word i loathe			0
' and i did everything in my power to make sure that that version did not appear in the programme that was transmitted			0
' in fact , i have here the note i sent at the time to the production office			0
' and it says , " i did n't use the n - word here but i 've just listened through my headphones and it sounds like i did			2
is there another take that we could use ? " ' please be assured i did everything in my power to not use that word			0
' and as i 'm sitting here begging your forgiveness for that fact that obviously my efforts were n't quite good enough			1
