but the baffled receptionist - identified only as @entity19 - thought he was being pranked and snapped back : ‘ oh yes ? and i 'm @entity9			1
’ the receptionist then tried to get a genuine response from the caller he believed to be a hoaxer , asking : ' who is it ? ' his holiness showed great patience dealing with the suspicious assistant and eventually managed to convince him that the call was genuine			2
he responded : ‘ i really am @entity2			1
' do not worry , @entity31 , just connect me with @entity32 , i would like to thank him for the charming letter			0
