is 2013 the year we finally make contact with our brothers from beyond the stars ? one @entity5 user certainly seems to think it 's a possibility			1
the user , danchek2013 , has uploaded a video he claims shows footage of at at least one mysterious object zipping about over the surface of the moon			1
one of the ' craft ' emerges from the shadowy landscape of the moon 's surface and then seemingly accelerates over the craters , before changing direction at breakneck speed and heading towards the bottom of the screen			1
scroll down to watch the video mystery : a white arrow highlights the mysterious object as it emerges from the darkness emergence : the spot gradually becomes visible as it heads towards the light intriguingly , it appears to leave vapour trails , similar to a plane , in its wake			1
so are they faraway birds ? dust motes ? shooting stars ? or an advanced interstellar craft from an advanced civilization that has travelled from another galaxy to observe our planet ? opinion is divided among the comments on the video			2
some believe the behaviour of the craft means it can not be a human plane or flying creature user ' king @entity51 ' said : ' at first i was like " meh ﻿ another satellite " and then one more showed up faster than the other and it did all those swift angle movements			1
' @entity58 simply said : ' that 's legit people ! ' close encounters : the alleged alien spaceship ( highlighted in red ) the craft , bottom right and under a darl patch , suddenly changes direction a close - up of the craft , right , complete with mysterious trail @entity71 believes the speed of the turns bunks the idea that the vessel is of human origin			1
she said : ' the g - force would in fact destroy whoever was on that craft			2
but we do n't have that technology , so those are n't humans on the craft			0
' some , however , are a little more sceptical			0
@entity86 called the video ' hilarious ' adding : ' it could so easily be @entity89 ( computer generated imagery )			0
' they are just little smudges			0
' ﻿ david peck was a little more scathing			0
he said : ' geez , these vids are so stupid			0
' et : is the mysterious craft a visitor from beyond the stars ? internet commentators ca n't agree video proof of aliens ? video shows mysterious objects in night sky			2

mysterious object recorded zipping about against the *backdrop* of the moon
is it a bird ? a plane ? or something altogether more *unfathomable*
@entity5 users argue over the *authenticity* of the ' alien craft '
