by @entity0 @entity1 : this 13 - year - old teenager slapped a 52 - year - old female fishmonger around the face with a sea bream a 13 - year - old girl who slapped a fishmonger in the face with a large sea bream has been let go by police after she apologised			1
the teenager was captured smiling on cctv moments before the bizarre fish - slapping incident at an @entity13 store in @entity14 , @entity15 , in february			2
police officers released the the camera footage in the hopes of tracing the person responsible and the attacker has now been identified as a 13 - year - old girl			1
but @entity22 today admitted the girl has been let go with a slap on the wrist after she wrote a letter of apology to the 52 - year - old staff member			1
in a statement @entity15 police said : ' following the appeal that we released , a 13 - year - old girl has been spoken to by officers and has taken part in a community resolution whereby she has sent the victim a letter of apology			1
' the matter has therefore been resolved and is now closed			0
there will be no more police involvement			0
' the 52 - year - old victim was working on the @entity13 fish counter when the teenager approached her stall and asked about what was for sale			1
without warning , the girl suddenly picked up a bream which was on ice and slapped the shocked worker with it before running out of the store			2
the victim believes the incident was being filmed on a mobile phone by a man stood nearby who also ran from the scene when challenged			0
scene : police let the teenager off after she wrote a letter of apology to the victim of the attack at @entity67 in @entity14 , @entity15 the attacker was initially described as being @entity69 and aged between 15 and 18 with blonde , shoulder - length untidy hair			1
police described the prank as ' completely unacceptable '			0
the incident is an odd echo of sketches by @entity76 - one of which featured a man in military uniform dancing on a canal towpath while slapping another man with a fish			0
his fun is brought to an abrupt halt when the second man pulls out an enormous specimen and uses it to hit his aggressor around the head , knocking him into the water			0
fish and hits : the woman was hit in the face with a bream , which can grow to 40cm long ( file photo ) the incident also has more serious echoes of ' happy slapping ' , a craze which took hold for a few years in the early 2000s when mobile phones were first equipped with video cameras			2
mostly performed by teenagers , the pranks involved slapping or hitting someone while being filmed and then uploading the footage to the internet			0
some took the prank too far and in 2008 a 15 - year - old girl , who was too young to be named , was sentenced to a two - year detention and training order after filming an attack on 29 - year - old victim @entity116 , who later died			1
no laughing matter : the incident is reminiscent of the fish slapping dance in a sketch by @entity122			0
