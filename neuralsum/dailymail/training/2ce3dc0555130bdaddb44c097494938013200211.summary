’ here are @entity129 ’s top 7 lifting tips for women			1
top tips : @entity129 , @entity130 & director of personal training at @entity132 , near @entity133 , shares his tips for women 1			1
bust the ‘ bulky ’ myth excess body fat is what makes women appear ‘ bulky ’ , not having lean muscle			1
lifting weights will not make you big ( the exception being women who use anabolic steroids )			1
the way women are naturally designed hormonally means that when you lift weights intelligently , you will burn fat from the areas you do n’t want it , and keep toned muscle in the areas you want it			2
the more lean muscle a woman maintains , the more calories she will burn at rest			2
in short , lean muscles speed up your metabolism , resulting in more effective fat loss			2
most women simply do not possess the level of testosterone necessary to support a bulky physique			2
ask any man that is trying to bulk up – it ’s hard ! 2			2
learn proper exercise form this is crucial - devote time to it up front			1
it ’s much easier to learn proper form now than to ingrain poor habits and try to fix them later			2
i highly suggest working with a knowledgeable coach or learning from reputable demonstration videos			2
master the @entity200 if you ’re just getting into strength training , stick with a few exercises to start with			2
why ? think about it this way - what would be easier to solve quickest ; 6 riddles , or 20 ? do n’t be fooled into thinking you need to ‘ keep your body guessing ’ , or that you must work every muscle individually with isolation exercises			2
for the best results , master your form and get stronger ( more on that next … ) in fundamental , compound human movements : squat ( or squat variation ) @entity217 ( or deadlift variation ) push up ( or a similar horizontal press ) @entity220 ( or a similar horizontal pull ) @entity222 ( or a similar vertical press ) @entity224 ( or a similar vertical pull ) if you have mobility issues / equipment restrictions / other concerns that do n’t allow you to properly perform certain exercises , use appropriate exercise substitutions			1
for example , @entity231 can be a great alternative to @entity234			2
likewise , if you ca n’t deadlift a straight bar off the floor , try @entity239 , @entity240 , or even @entity241 variations			2
follow a @entity242 if you ’re just getting into lifting weights , you need a well - structured , balanced program			0
do n’t make the mistake of following a training program for an intermediate or advanced lifter			0
while it may sound attractive , you ’ll get the best results by following an appropriate training program for your experience level			0
my program at the end of this @entity257 article is a great place to start			0
focus on getting stronger almost everyone should focus on getting stronger , no matter what their primary goal is			0
it ’s especially important for new lifters to develop a base level of strength			0
focusing on building strength is the best way for a beginner to get results - seeing the numbers go up is highly motivating and a great way to love your workouts as you progress week after week			0
think of strength as a glass , and the water inside the glass as all the ‘ qualities ’ we train for : athleticism , health , physique improvement , etc. the smaller your glass , the less ‘ qualities ’ you ’re able to express or improve			0
you ca n’t be ‘ athletic ’ ( or perform day - to - day physical tasks ) without having a foundation of strength			0
you ca n’t boost your metabolism or burn more fat in your training without building the strength to progressively work harder and smarter			0
the larger you make your glass ( strength ) , the more water ( physical qualities ) you ’re able to place inside your glass			0
strength is the foundation for improving performance and physical qualities			0
guru : @entity129 says : ' lifting weights is one of the best ways women can improve their health and physique			0
strength training , weightlifting , resistance training - whatever you want to call it - helps women get stronger , leaner , more athletic and develop a balanced , healthy and toned body ' 6			0
@entity318 spending an hour on the treadmill 3 or 4 times a week is about as motivating as sticking pins in your eyes for most women			0
it ’s one reason why long - duration cardio is inferior to strength training for building a stronger , better looking and healthier body			0
even if you just want to lose body fat and look better in your clothes , i highly recommend setting motivating , performance - driven goals like ‘ perform 5 @entity333 ’ or “ @entity217 ’			0
you will be more motivated to train consistently			0
all of my clients with the primary goal of losing body fat focus on getting stronger and improving their performance in the gym			0
they have more fun , enjoy training , increase their confidence , and within a short period of time realise their clothes are too big and they love the way they look			0
start today do n’t ‘ start on monday ’ or ‘ get back on it in the @entity351 ’			0
what does your first step need to be ? perhaps you should find a coach who can teach you proper exercise technique and set challenging goals			1
maybe you need to get a great training program			0
or possibly , you just need to get in the gym			0
whatever first step you need to take , do it today .			0
