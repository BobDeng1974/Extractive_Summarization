by @entity1 reporter published : 22:45 est , 13 november 2013 updated : 05:10 est , 14 november 2013 @entity2 is a death row inmate who raped and killed a three - year - old girl the governor has now changed his mind and decided to delay a death row inmate 's execution so that they can see if there is a way to donate his organs to his sick relatives			1
convicted child killer @entity2 made a last - minute request have his organs to both his sick mother and members of the public , and initially prison officials said no because of security issues			1
@entity21 ' mother has kidney disease and is on dialysis and his sister has a heart condition			1
governor @entity27 also rejected @entity21 ' plea of mercy last week , but after the murderer 's lawyers submitted a request to have his organs be put to good use , the state officials have decided to try to make the option work			1
@entity2 was scheduled to die on thursday for the rape and death of his girlfriend 's 3 - year - old daughter in @entity39 in 1993 but now his death has been pushed back			1
the death row inmate had maintained through attorneys that the request was not a delay tactic but a final gesture of goodwill			0
his execution has now been pushed back to july 2			1
in stopping the execution , @entity27 said he wanted to allow time to study the request the 40 - year - old inmate made monday to see if a donation could help someone else			1
@entity27 said that if @entity2 is found to be a viable donor to his mother , who has kidney disease and is on dialysis , or to others awaiting live transplants of non-vital organs , the stay would allow time for those procedures to be performed and for @entity21 to be returned to death row			1
@entity27 said that while @entity2 ' crime was heinous , his willingness to donate organs and tissue could save another life and the state should try to accommodate a donation			2
@entity2 was sentenced to death for raping and killing his girlfriend 's daughter , three - year - old @entity75 ( pictured ) , in @entity39 in 1993 ' i realize this is a bit of uncharted territory for @entity79 , but if another life can be saved by his willingness to donate his organs and tissues then we should allow for that to happen , ' @entity27 said in a statement			1
some 3,500 people in @entity79 and more than 120,000 nationally are currently awaiting organ donations , said @entity89 , a spokeswoman for the lifeline of @entity79 organ donation program			2
a spokeswoman said the department moved swiftly to evaluate the request but determined it was not equipped to accommodate pre- or post-execution organ donations			0
@entity2 also wants to donate his heart to his sister , who suffers a heart ailment			2
it appears that request would not be possible under the governor 's directive , since the heart is a vital organ and can not be donated after death			2
the person must be alive when the organ is donated			0
' it just would n't be possible , ' @entity89 said			0
@entity21 will be injected with a never - been - used combination of midazolam , a sedative , and hydromorphone , a painkiller			0
he has been languishing on death row for 20 years ' organ donation occurs following brain death and the organs are maintained on a ventilator			0
when a prisoner is executed , the oxygen stops flowing , the heart stops beating , the blood stops flowing			0
' vital organ donations raise larger ethical issues and have so far not been allowed during @entity128 executions , said @entity129 , executive director of the @entity130			0
@entity2 made his request after the governor denied him mercy and @entity2 had exhausted his other legal options			1
his attorney said it was n't a delay tactic but an attempt to do good			0
the state had left it up to @entity2 ' family whether the organs would be harvested after his death			2
@entity21 had been moved to @entity79 's death house wednesday , but a prisons spokeswoman said he was being returned to death row immediately after @entity27 's stay was issued to await the assessment 's findings .			0
