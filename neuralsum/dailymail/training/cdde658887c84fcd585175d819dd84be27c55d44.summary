@entity0 may be a month away , but one artist has created ghostly @entity2 that turn old photographs into creepy animations they include the haunting portrait of a princess , ghostly scenes of the @entity9 and even an image of an old woman who transforms into a flock of birds with a swish of her cloak			1
the looped animations are the work of @entity20 - based art director @entity19 , who modifies historical black and white photographs , which he finds in the @entity25 online archive , to create his animated scenes			1
he is drawn to ‘ unknowable places and persons ’ in the old images , this is @entity31 reported			2
mr @entity19 , 26 , began creating the strange @entity2 during grad school and since then , his @entity33 has become popular , attracting thousands of visitors			1
@entity2 are a type of compressed file format with a limited colour palette that can be quickly transmitted over the internet			1
the animations are short in length and automatically repeat so the action is on a loop			0
in one of the @entity2 , princess @entity43 starts a fire which sets the photo alight and peels away to reveal the original photographic portrait , before the action begins again			1
the original photograph was taken in around 1915 and belongs to the @entity51 at the @entity25 , where mr @entity19 saw it and was inspired to create a @entity53			1
princess @entity43 was born in 1909 and was queen of the @entity55 between 1948 and 1980			0
as an only child , her birth assured the royal family 's survival			0
she spent her childhood at @entity61 in @entity62 , and at @entity63 and @entity64 in @entity65 , where she received her education at a fast pace so she was ready to succeed the throne at the age of 18			0
mr @entity19 told @entity70 that the princess has an air of mystery , despite probably being a normal mischievous girl			1
‘ but something about the way these photographs are taken makes history unfamiliar to me			2
there is an unknowable quality to them			1
’ he said that some of the images are loaded with mysteries			0
‘ i sit with them for a while , just to see where they could go , ’ explaining that it can take days for him to come up with a short animated story to transform an old photograph			2
some of the stories are chilling , such as the soldier in the photo entitled ‘ french 42cm gun ’ where dust falls out from a barrel to the ground where it forms a new soldier who picks up the first fighter 's lifeless body and drags it out of shot			0
another shows a ruined tower that suddenly erupts with a shaft of light , propelling shadowy ' ghosts ' into the air			0
in one @entity53 , ghostly creatures stalk the ruins of @entity113 's steel works in @entity114 , @entity115 , which supplied armaments and artillery chains to the @entity118 during the @entity9			1
it is thought that a fire was started deliberately on january 18 , 1915 , which destroyed eight acres of factory as well as a block of workers ' houses			0
while @entity128 forces and disaffected locals were blamed , it remains as mystery as to who started the destructive blaze			0
in another photograph , a mysterious cloud reveals a foreboding black figure watching over the cleaning up of the @entity137 in @entity138 , @entity139			2
a small fire started in a shed and quickly spread out of control , destroying hundreds of homes and public buildings , however , remarkably , just two lives were lost			0
a portrait of prince @entity146 has been transformed by the artist , who shows the naval admiral seemingly concentrating before shadows of himself emerge from his body			2
the @entity146 was a younger brother of @entity128 emperor @entity151 and held various positions in the @entity153 , including grand admiral			0
at the beginning of @entity9 , prince @entity146 was named commander - in - chief of the @entity158 and when his mission ended , he left active duty with the dissolution of the monarchy in @entity128			1
mr @entity19 said that @entity53 animations enable him to use suspense and freeze particular moments in his surprising stories .			2
