these are the pictures that show how one man has followed his life 's ambition to become ' the human platypus '			1
@entity6 , 26 , has spent seven years transforming his features - stretching eight parts of his face beyond recognition - to emulate the distinctive bill of a platypus			1
he has stretched both of his ear lobes , his nostrils , septum and his top and bottom lip by more than nine - and - a - half inches altogether			1
the designer from @entity38 , @entity36 says he wo n't stop modifying his body until he realises his vision			1
' i love platypus - the way they look and even the word " platypus " itself , ' he said			1
' i like the way my stretched face and lips now look like a platypus bill			1
' all of the modifications i have added to my body make me feel whole			1
this is what i am now			1
it is what i have always wanted to be			2
' mr @entity6 said he was very shy as a child and felt like he did n't fit in with the people around him			1
' i was a very quiet child			2
when i was a kid , i felt as if i did n't belong in this world			2
i felt like it was n't my world and that i was looking at it as if from outside , ' he explained			2
' i knew that i would have to genuinely change myself and live differently to feel happy			2
' ' i love platypus ' : the designer from @entity38 says he wo n't stop modifying his body until he realises his vision ' this is what i am now ' : mr @entity6 said he was very shy as a child and felt like he did n't fit in with people mr @entity6 first became aware of body modifications at the age of ten			1
' when i saw body piercings for the first time on the internet , i became very interested			2
as i got older , i started learning about ear lobe stretching which was still very rare , ' he said			1
' i loved the way it looked - the way you could stretch your body to become who you want to be			2
it 's such a beautiful art. ' when he reached 18 and adulthood , mr @entity6 decided he would stretch his ear lobes himself			1
' i had no knowledge of how to do it so i made a lot of mistakes with my earlobes			2
but it was the start of my journey , ' he said			2
after getting his first taste for cosmetic body modifications , he began to explore other body parts that he could hollow out			2
' when i turned eighteen , i did n't know you could stretch anything else besides your ear lobes , ' he said			1
' but soon after i came across images of lip stretching in @entity101 countries and i liked them			2
' although i thought they were too small - i wanted my lip holes bigger			0
i wanted to take this ancient art to the next level			0
' then my friend said that if anyone could achieve a truly big , horizontal lip , they would look like a platypus			0
i wanted to be like that			0
i loved the large bill of a platypus			0
' celebrity : mr @entity6 modelling a fetching red smock at @entity117 fashion week in @entity36 he can talk ? mr @entity6 at the mic during @entity117 fashion week			1
despite his drastic facial modifications he says he can talk , eat and speak on the phone just like anybody else at nineteen , mr @entity6 started the slow and painful process of stretching his own top and bottom lip to attain this appearance			1
he would also embark on stretching both his nostrils and septum to create that elongated , billed look			1
seven years later , he has finally achieved a permanent , stretched size of 58mm on his bottom lip and 33mm on his top lip			1
and he plans on steadily increasing these throughout his life			0
' i would stretch my face and lips a little at a time and keep going			1
there was no limit , ' he said			0
' it has taken me years to get to where i am and now i feel like i finally belong in this world			1
' externally , i am now a platypus			0
my resemblance is the way i want it to be			0
inside though , i am more like a bird			0

nothing has changed at all , ' he said			0
