so , the discovery of what could be the great artist ’s paints has got art historians excited			2

the bladders of paint ( pictured ) were found at @entity3 's former house in @entity23 in the mid- 1960s during a clear - out , it is only now that experts are attempting to confirm their provenance before the invention of tubes made of lead or tin , painters carried bladders to store the paint that they would have made in their studio			1
the bladders were made from pig bladder - hence the name - and tied at the top with strong twine to keep air out			2
this kept the paint fresh and workable			0
it is unusual for such a large collection of delicate bladders of paint to survive			2
the ‘ bladders ’ of paint spent hundreds of years gathering dust in the attic at the famous 18th century @entity50 - born painter ’s former house			1
while they were found at the property in @entity23 in the mid- 1960s during a clear - out , it is only now that experts are attempting to confirm their provenance			2
the paints were discovered just after the house was opened to the public as a museum and art gallery some 50 years ago			1
the ' bladders ' of paint spent hundreds of years gathering dust in the attic at the famous 18th century @entity50 - born painter 's former house ( pictured ) @entity3 ( self portrait left ) painted some of @entity6 ’s most recognisable landscapes and famous portraits of 18th century aristocrats , such as @entity70 , @entity71 ( right ) executive director @entity72 intends to feature the historic paint bladders in an exhibition , but only after they have been examined by specialists			1
‘ we ’ve commissioned the @entity77 at @entity78 - they have lots of experience in this area , ’ mr @entity72 said			2
‘ the paints will undergo a scientific test to date them and to see if it ’s plausible that they ’re @entity3 ’s			1
’ he said that the museum is undertaking the work now that it has the funding , but it already knows that the bladders are mid- 18th century and @entity91			1
some 19 pouches were discovered in the attic and mr @entity72 said it is rare to find so many together			0
‘ it is possible that they were a present to someone in the family but to buy paints at that time was n’t cheap - they would have been a good present , ’ he said			1
‘ there are secrets yet to be revealed			0
’ the @entity50 - born painter 's former house in @entity23 ( pictured ) now hosts exhibitions of his work and is a museum for fans of @entity3 @entity3 was born in @entity23 , @entity50 in 1727 and became one of the country ’s most celebrated landscape and portrait artists before dying in 1788 aged 61			1
he left home in 1740 to study art in @entity117 with @entity118			0
after marrying in 1746 @entity119 and fathering two daughters , he moved to @entity121 in 1759 where fashionable society patronised him , and he began exhibiting in @entity117			0
in 1769 , he became a founding member of the @entity125 , but his relationship with the organisation was thorny and he sometimes withdrew his work from exhibition			0
@entity3 moved to @entity117 in 1774 , and painted portraits of the king and queen			0
he painted relatively simple landscapes and is credited ( along with @entity133 ) as the originator of the 18th century @entity6 landscape school			1
he painted quickly and his later pictures are characterised by a light palette and easy strokes			0
he preferred landscapes to portraits			0
his liking for landscapes is shown in the way he merged figures of the portraits with the scenes behind them			0
@entity3 worked more from observations of nature and of human nature than from application of formal academic rules			0
the poetic sensibility of his paintings caused @entity155 to say , ‘ on looking at them , we find tears in our eyes and know not what brings them			0
’ the paints ( pictured ) will undergo a scientific test to date them and to see if it 's plausible that they ¿ re @entity3 's			1
once the tests have been completed and the paints returned to @entity23 they will become part of an exhibition next year and a conference about @entity3 and contemporary artists			1
even if it turns out that the bladders did not belong to the ‘ son of @entity50 ’ they will still be a valuable addition to the museum ’s collection			1
' to have 19 surviving is a very rare thing - they are really important , ’ mr @entity72 said			0
once the scientific tests have been completed to establish the paints ' former owner , they will become part of an exhibition next year and a conference about @entity3 and contemporary artists			2
