@entity1 @entity0 is being forced to leave @entity3 's @entity2 after its february 2015 shows			1
the biannual event , which has been at the 2.4 - acre space since leaving @entity7 four years ago , has been court - ordered to leave in a pre-trial settlement , reports @entity10			1
the plaintiffs in the case - various community groups - argued that @entity0 and other events held there violated the @entity16 , which states that city - owned spaces can not be privatized			1
though the park is managed by and adjacent to @entity3 , it is still @entity22 property			2
so long , @entity0 ! the biannual event will have to find a new home after its february 2015 shows ' we 're going to get flowers and benches and there 's going to be a park again , ' said @entity29 , the president of one of the groups who filed the lawsuit			1
' we 're all very happy here			0
' we objected to the whole idea of demolishing a park and of throwing the public out and of making this a place for raising money			2
private people are n't supposed to be making money on it			0
' according to blog @entity45 , 57 trees and countless plants were destroyed to make way for events in the park , and all will have to be replanted as part of the settlement			0
descendants of @entity53 , the long - time conductor of the @entity54 and for whom the park is named , are also satisfied with the agreement			0
' i was horrified to learn about the demise of @entity2 , ' said @entity60 , his granddaughter			0
' it is ironic that a family of @entity65 immigrants , who brought so much to the musical life of this city and this country have been pushed aside by a @entity65 manufacturer of flashy cars			0
' the well - heeled masses will have to head elsewhere ! though it 's been suggested @entity0 will eventually end up at @entity74 when it opens in 2018 , it 's unclear where the 8 - day event will be held in the meantime it has yet to be determined where @entity0 - an eight - day spectacle where the who 's who of fashion editors and buyers go to see designers ' latest creations - will go after its last shows at @entity3 in february			1
@entity22 's former mayor @entity88 has suggested that the event could eventually move to @entity74 , an under - construction event space that is part of the @entity92 development on the far west side of @entity94			1
the six - story building , however , is n't slated to be open until 2018			0
in the meantime , designers may have to get creative about where they hold their shows - which more and more of them have been doing lately anyway			2
of the more than 300 shows during the week , less than 100 were held at @entity3 in recent years			1
many designers have opted for spaces that allow them greater creative freedom and a slower turnaround ( at @entity3 and @entity7 , shows are stacked back - to - back , forcing designers to clean up and move out at an alarming pace ) - not to mention a cheaper price - tag			1
@entity3 's @entity0 venues cost between $ 15,000 and $ 60,000 to rent , cites @entity110			2
those costs - along with publicity , models , stylists , and a host of other show necessities - make $ 200.000 ' a reasonable amount ' to expect to spend for a show .			0

the eight - day style spectacle has been court - ordered to leave after its february 2015 shows
since the event came to @entity3 four years ago , community groups have complained that it is *illegally* using public space for private purposes
it has yet to be determined where the shows will move
