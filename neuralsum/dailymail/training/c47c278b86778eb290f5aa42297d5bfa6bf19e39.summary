by @entity0 published : 07:40 est , 29 june 2012 updated : 10:20 est , 29 june 2012 @entity2 sufferers have been given hope of a more efficient treatment , after wide - scale tests on a breakthrough pill			1
the new ' @entity8 ' pill was found to be faster acting and have fewer side - effects compared to two widely - used drug regimens			1
and an extra bonus for those who need to take it , the solitary once - a - day pill removes the need for an array of drugs on a daily basis			2
quad : the new four - in - one @entity2 pill , described by doctors as an ' important new treatment option ' sufferers must rigidly adhere to their @entity2 medication routine because missed doses can quickly lead to the virus becoming resistant to the medication , making them more vulnerable to a progression of their illness			1
but now results from two large international trials , published in @entity35 , revealed that @entity8 was an ' important new treatment option ' that could improve compliance with treatment			0
the human immunodeficiency virus weakens the ability to fight infections and disease , such as cancer			0
@entity44 marks the final stage when the body can no longer battle life - threatening illnesses			2
@entity48 from @entity49 , @entity50 , lead author of the first study , said : ' our results provide an additional highly potent , well - tolerated treatment option and highlight the simplicity of treatment resulting from combining several antiretrovirals in a single pill			2
' he added that studies have shown single pill treatments improve both adherence and patient satisfaction and help prevent prescription errors , helping reducing the likelihood of treatment failure and drug resistance			1
the quad pill , which is a combination of elvitegravir , cobicistat , emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate , was created by @entity75			1
in may the @entity77 â€™s @entity76 voted 13 to 1 to approve it for the treatment of hiv - 1 infection in @entity81 adults who have yet to receive treatment			1
they will make a final decision in august			1
this illustration shows red blood corpuscles and the human immunodeficiency virus flowing through the circulatory system in the @entity35 study , the first trial randomly assigned 700 patients from centres across @entity93 to start treatment with two different single tablet regimens - either @entity8 , or a gold standard regimen approved by the @entity77 in 2006 , known as @entity97			1
after 48 weeks of treatment , 88 per cent of patients given @entity8 suppressed viral loads to undetectable levels compared with 84 per cent in the @entity102			0
adverse events that led to patients discontinuing treatment were infrequent and similar in both groups			0
mild nausea was more common with @entity8 , but patients were less likely to have dizziness , abnormal dreams and insomnia compared with @entity97			0
the second trial included 708 adults who had never received treatment from centres across @entity114 , @entity115 , @entity93 and @entity116			0
patients were randomly assigned to receive once - daily @entity8 or a popular and recommended twice - daily combination of protease inhibiotrsritonavir - boosted atazanavir ( @entity8 / @entity120 ) plus @entity122 / @entity121			2
by week 48 , 90 per cent of people in @entity8 had undetectable viral loads compared to 87 per cent of people in the @entity8 / @entity120 / @entity122 / @entity126			0
the safety of the two regimens was also similar			0
if approved by regulatory agencies , the @entity8 would be the first once - daily single - tablet regimen containing an hiv integrase inhibitor .			0

the quad pill was found to be more effective than two widely - used drug regimens
doctors say patients would find it far easier to remember to take one daily pill , *cutting* down risk of treatment failure
@entity77 to make final decision on drug *'s* approval in august
