by @entity0 the computer mouse has had a good run			0
but almost 70 years since the design was first patented , it is now under threat from a smart ‘ thimble ’			0
the wearable @entity8 device is fitted with an accelerometer and gyroscope , and lets people control an onscreen mouse using just a wave of their finger			1
the @entity16 device ( pictured ) is fitted with an accelerometer and gyroscope , and lets people control an onscreen mouse using a wave of their finger			1
the intelligent device was created by @entity23 and @entity24 from the @entity25 in @entity26 the intelligent gadget was created by @entity23 and @entity24 from the @entity25 in @entity26			0
it uses a 3d accelerometer , magnetometer and gyroscope to orientate where the mouse should be			1
the device also uses optical flow sensors to track movement against a @entity38 surface			1
a button between the forefinger and thumb is used in place of the left - click button on a standard mouse			2
the device also uses optical flow sensors to track movement against a @entity48 ( pictured )			1
all of this location data is streamed to a laptop and is used to move the cursor , it can also be used with touchscreen - style gestures such as double tap and long press all of this location data is streamed to a laptop and is used to move the cursor , it can also be used with touchscreen - style gestures such as double tap and long press			1
by combining data from all of the sensors , the @entity60 can more accurately determine the location on the screen , and the researchers claim it can be used to move a 3d object with a positioning error of only about 1 mm. and having more than one @entity60 on different fingers allows for multi-touch gestures			1

a button between the forefinger and thumb ( pictured ) is used in place of the left - click button on a standard mouse the original mouse prototype was patented in 1947			2
it is now widely used with pcs and @entity85 ( pictured ) currently , the device is wired to an @entity88 controller that records the sensor data , and this is then streamed to a laptop			1
the researchers are working on developing the technology so it can be used wirelessly			0
' @entity60 enables users to user their fingers or thumb as a 3d input device with the capability of performing 3d selection translation , and rotation , ' explained the researchers			1
' [ it ] is designed to fill the missing gap of a 3d input device that is self - contained , mobile , and universally working across various 3d platforms			2
' this presents a low - cost solution to designing and implementing such a device			2
modular solutions like @entity60 opens up a whole new design space for interaction techniques to further develop on			2
' with @entity60 , we attempted to bring @entity8 interaction and applications a step closer to users in everyday life			2
' the @entity120 app works alongside a small usb device called the @entity122 ( pictured ) and lets people create music using hand gestures while they sit in front of their computer it takes hours of practice and years of experience to become a piano virtuoso or a concert violinist			0
but a new app , that works alongside a small usb device lets people create music using hand gestures while they sit in front of their computer			0
users can move their hands and fingers in mid-air , which the clever little device beneath translates into motion and then a variety of sounds that can be layered up to make tunes			0
the innovation is described by the app ’s creators as ‘ a new expressive musical instrument ’			0
@entity152 based computer sensor manufacturer , @entity153 , has turned its attention to electronic music by enabling its hands - free controller to work alongside the @entity85 desktop app called @entity120			0
people can use the @entity122 , which costs € 89 ( £ 74 ; $ 79 ) to make their own ambient music			0
the technology , which is slightly larger than a cigarette lighter , tracks the points of fingers using three infrared leds and two image sensors to follow movement around 200 times more precisely than @entity171 ’s original @entity170 sensor .			0

@entity60 is a thimble - style device that sits on the end of a finger
it is fitted with a 3d accelerometer , magnetometer and gyroscope
device uses optical flow sensors to track movement against a *2d* surface
all this data is streamed to a laptop and used to move an onscreen mouse
it can also be used with touchscreen - style gestures such as tap and press
