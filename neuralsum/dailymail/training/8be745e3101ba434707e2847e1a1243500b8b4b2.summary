june @entity6 , 52 , from @entity7 , @entity8 , sourced @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 for friends claiming she could use her staff discount to get cars at up to half the normal price			1
but bizarrely , it emerged the claim was a lie and in fact she was having to pay full price			1
jailed : june @entity6 promised friends she could get cheap deals on cars but the claim was a lie @entity27 @entity26 heard @entity6 was unable to admit the truth and kept promising large number of cars for clients and taking more money to cover her losses			1
when the scheme finally unravelled and police were called , they discovered six customers were £ 544,585 out of pocket			2
one man alone lost £ 288,000 after handing @entity6 £ 316,000 to buy 67 cars and only receiving three			1
in total she ordered 133 vehicles for the six complainants who handed her £ 730,000 but only 16 were delivered			1
despite the sums involved , there was no evidence @entity6 had spent the proceeds on anything apart from a few clothes and a couple of budget holidays , the court was told			1
@entity6 admitted six counts of fraud and was jailed for two years yesterday			1
@entity57 , defending , said : ' this is , to say the least , a series of offending which has the most unusual features			0
there is no pot of gold here			0
' peer pressure : @entity6 was working as a receptionist at a @entity67 dealership in @entity8 when she began promising friends she could get cheap deals on luxury cars the offences happened between april , 2010 and november , 2011 when she worked for the @entity67 franchise in @entity8			1
her scam began when she bought a £ 15,000 @entity74 for her brother but he went to @entity76 and did not need it			2
so she sold the car to @entity79 for £ 7,000 making an £ 8,000 loss and from then on tried to cover her losses , said @entity82 , prosecuting			1
she told him she was able to obtain new cars at knockdown prices by using her staff discount or pooling it with other members of staff to get bargains			1
mr @entity79 was so impressed he ordered 67 cars from her and deposited £ 316,000 in her bank accounts			1
word soon spread about the cheap vehicles and @entity94 gave her £ 133,950 and placed an order for 50 cars			2
@entity97 ordered four cars at a cost of £ 98,500 and @entity100 deposited £ 131,085 for another 14 cars			2
@entity102 paid £ 51,000 for four cars while taxi driver @entity103 handed over £ 6,000 for a new car			2
but it was all a con			0
miss @entity82 said : ' @entity6 never received any discount on any of the vehicles purchased			1
they were bought at full price			1
' the scheme unravelled when most of the cars were not delivered and questions were asked			2
miss @entity82 said @entity6 , who has a partner and a son at university , received £ 730,000 from the six customers whose total losses were £ 544,585			1
it emerged that more than £ 839,000 had passed through her bank accounts from march , 2008 to february , 2012			0
fraud : @entity6 had told friends she could get luxury cars such as @entity11 's for up to half price with her staff discount when arrested by police she said she had promised to get the cars for her customers but realised she could not get them cut - price			1
she felt under pressure , particularly from mr @entity79 who after his bargain buy asked her for ' more and more ' cars			0
' he began to deposit large amounts to pay for those vehicles but she was unable to get those cars , ' said miss @entity82			2
' she needed more money to cover the losses and others became involved			1
' mr @entity57 said in a victim impact statement : ' i feel humiliated that i have been taken in like this			0
' mr @entity103 , who has a wife and two children said : ' it 's a lot of money to me			0
i thought it was an honest deal			0
' mr @entity94 received ten cars , mr @entity79 three cars , mr @entity97 , mr @entity57 and mr @entity102 one car each , while mr @entity103 got nothing			0
the court heard that other customers received cut - price cars from @entity6 but have not complained to the police			1
he went on : ' i have to acknowledge that honest people have lost a considerable amount of money			0
but some were happy with what happened			0
they approached this lady and bought cars from her at half the price they would have cost you or me			1
' it does beg the question as to what they thought was going on here when a receptionist was able to promise time after time these cracking deals for cars			2
' he said every time she found a car and sold it cheap she was getting more and more into debt			0
' this is a lady who is particularly vulnerable to pressure being brought to bear upon her			0
' when things spiraled out of control she could not say ' no '			0
he said : ' the amount of dishonesty is out of proportion to the losses here			0
she did not live the life of @entity193			0
' judge @entity194 said @entity6 had glowing testimonials and ordinarily was a ' decent and caring mother			2
' she had not set out to be dishonest from the outset			0
' it was one which grew and grew causing these extremely substantial losses , ' he said			0
after the hearing miss @entity82 said : ' she thought these customers were her friends and she did n't want to let them down			0
she thought if she stopped she would lose their friendship			0
