the stunning view from the world 's largest paper airplane as it soars above an @entity4 desert has been captured in a new ad for @entity7 cameras			0
the plane , called the @entity9 , measures a massive 45 feet long and 26 feet wide with a 24 foot wingspan , and has been known to reach speeds of up to 98 miles per hour			1
the plane is based on the original @entity9 design developed in 2012 by the @entity13 in @entity14			0
a paper plane crew member fixes a camera to the body to capture the craft 's flight before launch , the plane must be taken thousands of feet into the sky via helicopter the helicopter prepares to release the 45 feet long plane to the winds the @entity9 was designed by a 12 year old , @entity26			1
45 feet long 26 feet wide with a 24 foot wingspan can reach speeds of 98 miles per hour			1
weighs 800 - pounds towed approximately 4,000 feet into the sky before being released the model 's origins can be traced to a local newspaper contest for six - to14 - year - olds to see who could build the paper plane that would fly farthest			2
the winner was @entity26 , 12 , who then used his plans to build a larger model named after him			0
at the time of the flight , the @entity39 's executive director @entity38 told @entity42 : ' the arresting visual of the paper airplane in flight rekindled the childhood creativity in all of us the massive @entity9 paper airplane is based on the winning design for a newspaper contest for six - to - 14 - year - olds made only of corrugated cardboard , the wings soon begin to come apart in the high winds ' the museum is thrilled to conduct the first - ever @entity55 , part of our larger effort to inspire @entity59 's youth and spark a passion for aviation and engineering in the next generation			2
' the plane was built with falcon board , which the @entity66 described as a type of corrugated cardboard not unlike that used in a pizza box			1
the plane plunges to the earth as the body begins to come apart the remnants of the plane wait to be recovered after crash landing in the desert the original model also had a helping design hand from @entity78 in @entity79 , who helped in the design of the @entity82 stealth bomber			0
assuming this year 's model is similar to its 2012 counterpart , the 800 - pound airplane had to be towed approximately 4,000 feet into the sky before being released			2
as the video shows , the plane glides smoothly on the wind before bits of it begin to come apart and it crashes back to the earth .			0
