an @entity1 user told of his shock today after being hit with a £ 19,000 bill for his internet usage			0
@entity5 , from @entity6 , @entity7 , contacted his phone company , @entity8 , when they cut off his phone without warning			1
the 26 - year - old builder was told he had racked up a bill of £ 8,900 down to unusually high internet usage			0
he claims the adviser then warned him his next bill was due to be another £ 10,000			0
thought it was a joke : @entity5 with a letter from @entity8 demanding payment of a £ 19,000 for internet usage on his mobile which appears to have occured due to a fault with the mobile device mr @entity5 said : ' my first reaction was to laugh as i just could not believe it but it stopped being funny when i realised they were not joking and were totally serious			1
' @entity8 tried to take the £ 19,000 for the months of october and november from his bank account , only for the transaction to be blocked			1
the problem appears to have been caused by a fault which meant his @entity1 started sending and receiving large amounts of data in error			1
mr @entity5 and his partner @entity36 have been left disgusted by the treatment they received , which they say even included threats to send bailiffs around			2
he asked for his rogue iphone to be switched off , but even when it was off it continued to automatically send and receive large amounts of internet data			2
a bid to stop the problem by restoring the factory settings had no impact either			0
read it and weep : the letter from @entity8 explained that mr @entity5 's contract would be suspended until he paid his outstanding £ 19,000 balance			2
the firm has since said it will not charge him anything if his phone manufacturer confirms the glitch baffled staff at the @entity59 agreed that the phone was faulty and agreed to replace it			1
but mr @entity5 's nightmare did not end there - as @entity8 said they would still be charging him a capped bill of a whopping £ 300			2
he claims that when told the mobile phone giant that he would not be forking out cash beyond his normal billing amount he was warned of the heavy - handed response			0
his partner @entity70 added : ' @entity5 was advised that the £ 300 was simply not up for discussion and that he must pay up			0
' we were told that failure to do so would mean they would be sending a bailiff round for the full amount of the original bill of £ 8,907			0
' the erroneous debt would have had a massive impact on both our lives as our house could have been blacklisted - that is if we had still had a house at the end of it all			0
' apologetic : @entity8 said it would scrap the bill once it has received confirmation of the glitch from the phone manufacturer mr @entity5 was sent a letter from his bank saying they had blocked a transaction of £ 19,000 which @entity8 had tried to take from his account			1
@entity8 has now accepted they were wrong to try and bill @entity5 for the faulty phone and have apologised			1
an @entity8 spokesman said : ' we would like to apologise to mr @entity5 for any distress caused by receiving this unusually high phone bill ' it does appear that this resulted from a fault with his device and we are happy to reduce the bill to zero as soon as we have received confirmation of the fault from his manufacturer			1

@entity5 , 26 , thought it was a joke when he was cut off without warning
apparently caused by glitch which sent and received huge amounts of data
@entity8 tried to take money out of his account , but bank blocked transaction
@entity125 says it will scrap charge if phone manufacturer confirms problem
