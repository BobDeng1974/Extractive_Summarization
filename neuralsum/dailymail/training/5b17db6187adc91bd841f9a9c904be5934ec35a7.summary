by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 19:00 est , 10 november 2013 updated : 07:12 est , 11 november 2013 the government was last night accused of profiting from ‘ vulnerable ’ people by forcing them to phone premium - rate numbers			1
a damning investigation has found that more than 100million calls to state - backed offices by crime victims , pensioners , the recently bereaved and students were to high - rate numbers charging up to 35p a minute			1
@entity12 hinted that premium - rate numbers could be banned for advice lines for grieving families , after mps condemned the widespread use of the lines which cost callers £ 56million in 2012/13			1
frustration : premium numbers for calling public bodies are costing the taxpayer millions - almost half of which is wasted waiting on hold nearly two thirds of calls fielded by government organisations were made to the higher - rate 0845 numbers , a @entity27 committee found			1
only 40 out of the 365 customer phone lines are free to use			0
anyone who phones a government line to report the death of a spouse for tax or benefits purposes pays premium rates , while the @entity42 also uses the numbers , saying that doing away with them would cost it £ 1million in revenue			1
almost half the £ 56million was generated while callers were on hold , waiting to speak to advisers			1
last night @entity50 , chairman of the @entity51 , said : ‘ customers of government services should be able to contact these services easily and cheaply			2
‘ charging customers higher rates by making them use 0845 or other high - rate numbers is not acceptable , especially when the customers are often vulnerable			0
’ pocketed by the taxman : @entity60 was held up as an example of ' astonishingly bad ' customer service , keeping callers on hold for an average of seven minutes she said the @entity67 had to urgently establish rules for charging , adding : ‘ there should be low - cost alternatives for all services used by a lot of vulnerable people			1
’ callers should also be informed of the costs involved in phoning particular numbers , her committee concluded			0
which ? executive director @entity78 said : ‘ it ’s ridiculous that people face a bumper bill to call a public body , especially when they have to wait on hold			0
‘ almost 60,000 people have supported our costly calls campaign for all companies and public bodies to provide either freephone or local rate numbers for their customer service and complaints lines			1
‘ this practice has been costing cash - strapped consumers millions of pounds			0
’ ' not acceptable ' : @entity51 chairman @entity50 said new rules were urgently needed the committee also found that many departments were ‘ astonishingly bad ’ at answering calls			2
@entity60 answered only 16 per cent of the calls it received on its tax credits helpline on the deadline day for notifying the department of changes of circumstances			1
customers to the tax department were put on hold for an average of seven minutes			0
the @entity67 told the committee that the current situation was unacceptable			0
it has set up a working group to define new rules for premium - rate numbers within government			1
@entity121 's official spokesman said the prime minister was concerned about the use of costly phone lines for people looking for advice when a loved one dies			0
the spokesman added : ' he does understand concerns that people have , particular when it comes to advice people are taking at challenging times of their family ’s lives such as bereavement			0
‘ that is something that should be looked at closely			0
’ outside central government , @entity141 trusts and gps have also faced criticism for using premium - rate numbers			1
mrs @entity50 said that one of her @entity147 constituents spent £ 30 to make an appointment for her 30 - year - old disabled son with a gp			0
she added : ‘ i do n’t know how many calls she had to make			0
’ @entity155 , head of @entity157 ’s help line , said : ‘ we are currently looking at ways of reducing the cost to people calling @entity157 ’s support line			2
’ a @entity164 spokesman said : ‘ the @entity164 provides free telephone numbers ( 0800 ) for all of our claim lines			2
the @entity164 does not earn any revenue from 0845 numbers			2

almost two thirds of calls fielded by the government are premium rate
@entity157 , @entity60 and the @entity164 use them
almost half the total was generated while callers waste their time on hold
@entity182 have demanded that new rules are established to *protect* callers
