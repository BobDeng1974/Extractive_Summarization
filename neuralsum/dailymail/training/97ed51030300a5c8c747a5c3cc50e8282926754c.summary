by @entity0 a photographer has captured stunning aerial images of mountain - tops and sprawling deserts across @entity5 , @entity6 and @entity7 , that look like images of distant planets seen from space			1
@entity11 , who is a director and producer for the @entity13 , books window seats on airplanes especially for his hobby			1
the 34 - year - old from @entity18 , who has worked on a range of tv series including ' @entity22 ' , ' @entity23 ' , ' life ' and ' how @entity25 made @entity26 ' , travelled around the region capturing aerial shots of deserts , mountains and even sweeping fires			1
@entity13 director and producer and part - time photographer @entity11 has taken the stunning images of sprawling deserts across @entity5 , @entity6 and @entity7 - pictured is the @entity36 in @entity5 mr @entity11 said : ' i first read about the famous @entity38 of @entity5 when i was a student 15 years ago , so when i realised that my recent flight back from @entity40 flew directly over this spectacular landscape i booked a window seat and hoped for a clear day			1
' he was not disappointed , and decided to explore the spectacular views beneath him			0
around 300 kilometres east - southeast of @entity44 lies @entity45 , also known as the @entity46			0
mr @entity11 ' remarkable photographs of the sprawling @entity38 capture the beauty and detail of the landscape			2
further images of the @entity52 in @entity5 - a massive mountain range stretching from @entity54 and @entity55 stretching to the south @entity57 sea a view of an eroded salt dome in @entity46 , north @entity5 - the full name of which is @entity46 , because of the nature of the material in the flats			2
' @entity64 ' literally means ' salt ' in @entity66 a river winding its way through the mountains of south @entity7 , an area known for its appearances in local legend			0
many highly religious people still make trips to the mountains for spiritual pilgrimages mr @entity11 did n't only take pictures of the uninhabited areas , also capturing built up areas like north west @entity6 , where smoke can be seen rising from fires in the area ' many of my images look like sliced onions or giant eyes , others look like racing tracks , ' he said			1
' from the air it is a mesmerising landscape of parallel and concentric lines which resemble the rings of @entity93 , on the ground it is one of the hottest and driest places on earth			0
' most would assume that the @entity46 has been bone - dry since the beginning of time			0
but experts believe that tens of millions of years ago a salt - rich ocean flowed through this area , surrounding a micro continent that is now central @entity5			2
river channels at the foot of mountains in south west @entity7 - an area rife with new and emerging rivers and streams that flow across the mountain ranges this image seems more like a vivid painting or image from another planet , but instead it shows the mountains of south west @entity7 meets the coast of the @entity118 sea at @entity119 an eroded salt dome in the @entity46 of north @entity5 - mr @entity11 believes that he has uncovered new features of the area that have not been documented an arial view of the eroded salt dome in the @entity46 in northern @entity5 - taken from directly above mr @entity11 explains that the evaporation of the ocean left behind a layer of salt up to 7 kilometres thick			1
due to its low density as layers of younger rock buried the salt , it began to push upwards , shaping the younger rock into domes			0
mr @entity11 said : ' @entity135 and rain continue to wear away the top of the domes to expose them in cross-section , like slicing an onion , to reveal geological works of art that are particularly striking when seen from the air			2
' he finds many interesting sights and objects within his photography and believes he stumbled across a mysterious base in the @entity38 in @entity5			1
in this image of the desert in @entity5 , a base can be seen in the topmost corner of the picture - @entity11 believes this base could be unmarked or lost , due to the fact that it does not appear on any official records or maps in areas with the same coordinates this image of the @entity46 in @entity5 looks more like an image of the planet @entity93 seen through a telescope , showing how otherworldly some desert areas can look from above the images of the @entity46 were taken over the course of many trips , and are part of @entity11 ' hobby , which is booking trips on planes going over the desert and taking pictures out of the window the photographer said : ' one of my photos shows a road going straight across the patterns and another ( in the top left hand corner ) shows some sort of base in the desert , possibly military			1
i 've found most of the sites on @entity184 and i have gps coordinates but i ca n't find this base anywhere			0
' he says he is certain , that based on the geology , rock markings , and the route of his plane that the coordinates on @entity189 are 34.935538 , 54.436137			0
but @entity189 do not appear to show the base he uncovered in his photograph the snow - covered mountains of southern @entity5 , where a small village on the sides of a major road snaking its way through the mountain pass can be seen on the right of the picture @entity207 , 34 , has produced and directed many @entity13 travel documentaries and has been working on these images as a hobby for years - booking passage on planes in order to take his pictures mr @entity11 also travelled to @entity5 to photograph the snow - coated @entity52			1
he captured a particularly striking photo with a clear line marking where the snow begins , and similarly to the @entity38 , the magic of the @entity52 lies in their exquisite detail			0
the white snow trickling down the dusty - pink mountain creates a pattern similar to the structure of veins			0
his aerial shots of the rocky , mountains in @entity7 show exposed layers of an anticline and ancient folded rock formed by mountain building processes .			2

34 - year - old @entity11 is a producer for the @entity13 , and takes the aerial pictures as a hobby
he books pictures on window seats of planes especially to take high *definition* pictures of the landscapes below
most of his pictures show vast areas of desert in the @entity245 , as well as sprawling *cities* and coasts
through his photography , @entity11 believes he has even discovered an unmarked base in the deserts of @entity5
