by @entity0 a disabled pensioner who lost more than £ 700,000 in a telesales scam has won most of his money back			0
@entity4 , 77 , was ‘ cajoled , bullied and , on occasions lied to ’ in order to get him to part with his retirement savings as part of a ' land banking ' scheme			1
cold - callers convinced him to invest huge amounts of money buying up land in the scheme , in the hope it would be later be sold to developers at a huge premium			0
ruling : @entity4 , 77 , was given more than £ 600,000 compensation at the @entity20 , part of the @entity22 , pictured but the land - small plots in @entity25 , @entity26 in @entity27 and @entity28 in @entity23 - had ' zero ' chance of being given planning permission , and turned out to be practically worthless			1
mr @entity4 , who is hard of hearing , suffers from cerebral palsy and uses a wheelchair , spent a total of £ 705,895 on the scheme , including £ 100,000 in ' facilitation fees ' between june 2009 and february 2011 , a high court judge said			2
and even though the company running the scheme - part of umbrella group @entity38 - liquidated with debts of more than £ 5million , mr @entity4 was still granted compensation from a solicitor whom the court ruled was in on the scheme			1
saying that the solicitor - who had earned hefty fees from legal work for @entity38 ( @entity38 ) - was ' party to a common design ' in the scheme , the judge ordered him to pay mr @entity4 damages of £ 606,000			1
the solicitor , who has not been named for legal reasons , had been disciplined twice by the @entity55 before for mishandling clients ' funds and was fined a total of £ 25,000 , the court heard			0
worthless investment : in land banking scams , investors are sold small plots of land with the implication that they will rocket in value and be used for investment - but in reality the land often has no chance of being given planning permission			1
pictured is protected green belt land in @entity73 the judge said there was no evidence that the solicitor , who carried out conveyancing work for @entity38 , had told any lies himself or had any knowledge that telesales staff were ‘ peddling ’ misleading information to mr @entity4			1
even though he was not acting for mr @entity4 personally , nor did he owe him a legal duty of care , the judge pointed out that he was earning money from the scheme , and could easily have pointed out that there was ' zero ' chance of the investment coming good			0
the judge said : “ but there is no evidence that he did any of these things			0
why is that ? ' it seems to me that there can really only be one answer : like @entity38 , he was eager to ensure the success of each scheme because he would be likely to benefit substantially from such success			0
' it was certainly not in his financial interests that anything should be done which might have the effect of dissuading purchasers from investing in the schemes , quite the reverse '			0
rejecting claims that mr @entity4 had himself been negligent in investing in the scheme , the judge said @entity38 had ‘ expressly discouraged ’ him from obtaining independent legal advice - saying that it offered a ‘ free legal service ’			2
the solicitor was ordered to pay mr @entity4 back the money he had lost , less the £ 99,895 facilitation fees for which he could not be held responsible .			2

@entity4 , 77 , was conned into investing life savings in ' land banking '
salesmen ' cajoled ' and ' bullied ' him into buying plots of land , with the *expectation* that their value would rocket
but the land was in fact worthless , and the investment company liquidated
@entity20 ruled that mr @entity4 was entitled to compensation from a solicitor who worked for the company - and he received £ 606,000
