by @entity0 published : 06:54 est , 15 july 2013 updated : 07:15 est , 15 july 2013 a new language has been discovered in a small outback @entity3 town			1
the language , now known as @entity5 , is used in @entity6 , a tiny desert community located half - way between @entity8 and @entity9 , on the edge of the @entity11			1
the isolated village has a population of about 700 and is populated mostly by the descendants of @entity15 forcibly resettled by the @entity3 government			1
discovery : the language , now known as @entity5 , is used in @entity6 , a tiny desert community located half - way between @entity8 and @entity9 , on the edge of the @entity11 all residents speak traditional ' strong ' @entity20 and some speak @entity22 , an @entity24 - based creole developed in the late 19th century , reported @entity3 's @entity25			1
only about 350 young locals speak the @entity5 - and none of them are over 35			1
@entity28 , a professor in the department of linguistics at the @entity31 in @entity32 documented the discovery of @entity20 in a study published online in the journal @entity36 reported @entity37			2
@entity28 first discovered the language when she began working in a school in the @entity40 where traditional @entity20 was being taught to children			1
she noticed that some of the students appeared to switch between several languages in conversation			2
' after a while , i realised this switching took place in every sentence , and i decided to investigate it , " @entity28 said			0
' once i recorded children speaking , i looked at the patterns and i could see that there were very striking systematic patterns			0
it was then that i realised this was a system of its own , ' she told the website			0
select : only about 350 young locals speak the @entity5 - and none of them are over 35 ' the striking thing about @entity20 is that most of the verbs come from @entity24 or @entity22 , but most of the other grammatical elements in the sentence come from @entity20 , ' @entity28 told the website			1
in the @entity68 words can be placed in any order , and grammatical interpretations are based on suffixes that are attached to the nouns			0
another interesting facet is a word form that refers to both the present and past time , but not the future			0
according to @entity77 it is likely @entity20 emerged in the 1970s and 1980s			1
she believes it was when children went from switching between @entity24 , @entity22 and @entity20 to speaking the mixed @entity20 language on a primary basis			1
the news , which has excited linguists across the world is not the first time the tiny town has hit the headlines			2
in 2010 , residents were left speechless after fish began falling from the sky			0
hundreds of spangled perch bombarded residents of @entity6 , shocking local @entity94 , who was walking home when the strange ' weather ' started			2
she said : ' these fish fell in their hundreds and hundreds all over the place			0
the locals were running around everywhere picking them up			0
meterologists say the incident was probably caused by a tornado			0
it is common for tornados to suck up water and fish from rivers and drop them hundreds of miles away .			0

the newly - discovered language is now known as @entity5
used in @entity6 , a tiny desert community in @entity3
only 350 *people* use it and they are all aged under 35
it is likely @entity20 emerged in the 1970s and 1980s
