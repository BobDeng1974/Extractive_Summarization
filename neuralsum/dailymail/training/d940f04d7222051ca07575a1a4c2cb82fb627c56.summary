by @entity1 reporter @entity2 : 13:32 est , 31 december 2013 @entity3 : 14:33 est , 31 december 2013 an alleged shark that appeared in a @entity7 , @entity8 , wave on friday as two children played in the water nearby was a dolphin , according to experts			1
a local mother was taking a picture of her 12 - year - old son and a friend just as they were about to catch a wave when the sea creature appeared in the break			1
the ‘ photobomb ’ story went viral on sunday and monday , as people argued over whether it was a shark or a dolphin			2
not a shark : a @entity7 mother captured this image of what was initially thought to be a shark in the break of a wave next to her son and a friend in the water at @entity7 , @entity8 the verdict has now been delivered with an overwhelming majority of scientists concluding that the sighting was in fact of a bottlenose dolphin			1
experts say the tail fin is horizontal , like that of a dolphin and there is no sign of a second dorsal fin , which sharks have and dolphins do not			1
bottlenose dolphins are also frequently seen surfing in the faces of waves , while sharks are not , according to @entity53			0
@entity54 , a naturalist with the @entity55 in @entity56 , posted on her @entity58 page that the sea creature was definitely a dolphin			0
dolphins vs sharks : dolphins have horizontal flukes , shown here in this image big difference : sharks have a second dorsal fin , seen here in this image , which dolphins do not ‘ i hate that the poor sharks are getting a bad , scary rep for this when it ’s a coastal bottlenose dolphin , ’ she wrote			1
@entity74 of the @entity76 chapter of the @entity77 said in another @entity58 comment : ‘ @entity79 looks to be a bottlenose dolphin ! single falcate dorsal fin , horizontal flukes			1
general body shape looks dolphin-esque too			0
’ @entity85 - based shark connoisseur , @entity84 , says the creature is obviously a dolphin , based on its flat tail fin			1
‘ i asked about a dozen shark scientists and a handful of dolphin scientists [ sic ] to confirm my suspicion that it was a dolphin , and 100 per cent of them identified it as a dolphin			0
' it does n’t have a second dorsal fin and the tail is flat			2
’ rant : @entity84 , a shark enthusiast , took to @entity58 to deliver his thoughts on the issue of the ' shark ' photo - bomb it is not the first time a dolphin has been mistaken for a shark			0
professional surfer , @entity110 , was photographed riding a wave which contained a creature that at first was thought to be a shark at the @entity115 surf contest at @entity116 near @entity117 , @entity8 , in september 2012			2
it was later identified as a bottlenose dolphin based on the shape of its dolphin - like fluke			1
and in 2011 in north @entity124 , surfers were sure that a large critter photographed in a wave was a large great white shark			0
but that , too , was most likely a dolphin turned sideways as it swam through the wave			0
confusion : the bottlenose dolphin has many times been mistaken for a shark jaws ? surfers have often been photographed riding waves containing what looks to be a shark however , there are still some who believe it is a shark , such as @entity144 , co-director of the @entity145 and @entity55			2
and @entity146 , a great white shark expert from @entity148 ’s @entity147 , told @entity53 that the tail in the picture from the recent shark scare ‘ does n’t really look like a shark tail more than , say , a dolphin sideways in the wave ’			2
but he added that it was ‘ impossible to say for sure from the picture alone ’			0
@entity157 , a white shark expert who runs the @entity158 at @entity159 , said the tail looked more like that of a dolphin .			0

alleged shark is a bottlenose dolphin say experts
verdict based on the tail which is horizontal like a dolphin *'s*
there is also no sign of a second dorsal fin , which sharks have
the shark - *resembling* creature swam in a wave behind a *couple* of children in the water at @entity7 , @entity8 , on friday
the mother of one of the surfers took a picture of her son and captured the dolphin through the break of the wave
picture of alleged shark had gone viral after it was made *public*
