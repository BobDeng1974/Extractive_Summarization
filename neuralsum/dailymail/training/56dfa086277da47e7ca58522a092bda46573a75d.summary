the @entity0 who gave up her quest to swim from @entity3 to @entity4 because of painful jellyfish stings said thursday that she will not make another attempt			1
@entity7 said that she had picked june because the jellyfish danger was supposed to be low			1
but about 11 hours and 14 miles into her expected 60 - hour , 110 - mile journey , she found herself in a swarm			1
' i had one coming out of my mouth			0
i was pulling it , this tentacle out of my mouth , but i do n't remember this moment			0
my kayaker told me that i was doing this , ' cause i have no recollection			0
i 'm not coming back			0
that 's it , ' she said			2
the jellyfish caught her by surprise			0
' i got smashed with them coming from every direction , ' she said			0
' i would not have gone to all this trouble if i had known they would be out in such numbers in june			0
' she was pulled out of the water and taken by one of her support vessels to @entity26 , where she was resting at a hotel thursday			0
she said the trip back to land was excruciating			2
' it was two and a half hours of the worst pain , continuously , every second , of my whole entire life			1
it 's like fireballs in every fiber , ' she said			2
it was the fifth failure involving three women who have tried to make the marathon swim the past three summers			1
jellyfish stings and strong currents have been the main impediments			0
ouch : @entity0 long - distance swimmer @entity7 shows jellyfish stings after giving up her quest to become the first person to swim from @entity3 to @entity4 without a shark cage not coming back : @entity0 long - distance swimmer @entity7 vowed to never return to the jellyfish - infested waters of @entity3 tears : @entity7 wipes a tear as she addresses reporters after her failed swim @entity80 tweeted her commiseration			1
the endurance athlete has failed three times trying to make the same crossing and says she 'd like to take another shot this summer			0
' it 's a tough night for @entity7 , a superior swimmer and an exemplary spirit , ' @entity80 wrote			1
endurance swimmer @entity88 has also tried and failed to make the swim			2
@entity0 @entity90 successfully made the crossing in 1997 , but she did it with the benefit of a shark cage			0
@entity7 had twice made a double crossing of the @entity95 , but the most time she had spent in the water continuously was 25 hours			1
she attempted her @entity3 to @entity4 swim under @entity99 rules , which meant she could not touch her support boat or hold on to anything			1
she also was n't allowed to wear a full - body wetsuit , which would have helped protect against jellyfish			2
@entity7 and her team spent nine and a half months planning the trip and studying others ' attempts			1
box jellyfish : experts believe the @entity0 was attacked by a box jellyfish , like that pictured , which are common in the @entity36 off to a good start : @entity114 waves to spectators as she begins her swim to @entity4 from the waters off @entity119 , @entity3 , on wednesday , june 12 , 2013 but she abandoned her attempt 11 hours later @entity0 swimmer @entity7 had to abandon her plan to swim from @entity3 to @entity4 after 11 hours due to a ' debilitating ' jelly fish sting @entity7 had expected to spend about 60 hours in the sea before reaching the @entity124 , a little more than 100 miles to the northeast the repeated failures raise the question of whether the @entity3 - to - @entity4 swim without a cage is even doable as a 2.5 day swim is stretching the physical limits of even elite endurance athletes			1
according to the @entity133 , the longest open water swim without flippers was 139.8 miles by @entity137 @entity136 , who swam between two @entity139 cities on the @entity140 from aug. 29 to 31 , 2006			1
dr. @entity141 , a sports medicine specialist at the @entity143 , said he thinks the @entity3 - to - @entity4 swim can be done , although there are several physical obstacles to overcome			1
he has advised @entity80 on her swims			2
while the water is more than 80 degrees in late spring and summer , it is still well below the body 's normal temperature of 98 degrees and causes it to slowly drop			2
no matter how often the swimmer stops to eat , she will never ingest enough calories to make up for those expended swimming , he said			0
after a while , that causes the muscles to start breaking down			0
preparing : @entity0 swimmer @entity7 adjusts her earplugs as her husband applies grease around the edges of her suit to prevent chafing this is the moment @entity7 jumped into the water at @entity173 to start her swim to @entity4 from @entity119 , @entity3 then there is dehydration , he said			1
even though swimmers do n't feel it , they sweat just like any other athlete , while the saltwater acts like a wick , drawing even more water out of the body			0
finally , there is sleep deprivation -- exercising that hard for days without sleep can result in hallucinations			0
' the variable is the jellyfish , ' @entity141 said			0
he said their bites are very painful and potentially fatal if not treated			0
' @entity7 would have gotten a lot further into her swim if she had n't been bit			1
' adding to the swimmer 's strain are the @entity36 's currents			2
@entity200 , a @entity143 oceanography professor , said that the swim from @entity3 to the @entity124 ' is very challenging as the currents are not only very strong but also extremely variable			0
' but , she said , modern computer models that utilize information from satellites , buoys and ships allow the swimmer 's support team to better predict the currents and help the members decide the best time to start the swim , the best route to take and then make adjustments along the way			1
@entity7 puts on her goggles as she prepares to jump into the water and start her swim to @entity4 from @entity119 , @entity3 failed : @entity7 and her team have spent the last nine and a half months planning the trip and studying others ' attempts to try to figure out why they were unable to complete the swim map : the treacherous route from @entity119 to @entity4 that @entity7 will take for the 160 - km swim			1

@entity7 , 29 , set - off on the 160 - km ( 100 - mile ) swim on wednesday
she had to quit after 11 hours because of the jelly fish sting
had planned on trip taking about 60 hours to complete
since 2011 , four *unsuccessful* , *uncaged* swims have been attempted
@entity7 : ' it 's the hardest marathon swim in the entire world '
