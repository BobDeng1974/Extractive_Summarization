by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 20:53 est , 27 march 2013 updated : 21:11 est , 27 march 2013 @entity4 coo @entity3 's new book , lean in - offering advice for how women can get ahead in the workplace - has received a mixed range of reviews from critics but none as harsh as a tweet sent to one particular negative reviewer			1
former head of public relations at @entity16 , who is working on promoting @entity3 ’s book , sent the abusive tweet on wednesday after becoming infuriated at the review that appeared in @entity20 written by another @entity21 , @entity22			1
@entity22 worked as a speechwriter for ceo @entity24 and last year published a memoir of her time at the company			1
war of words : @entity22 , left , received the angry tweet from @entity16 over her review of the @entity3 's ' feminist manifesto ' @entity31 lean in : @entity3 , @entity4 's chief operating officer , said that men still dominate the workforce and things need to change from her review of @entity3 ’s new book , @entity35 clearly is n’t a fan of the @entity40 ’s musings about the path forward for working women			1
‘ by arguing that women should express their feminism by remaining in the workplace at all costs , @entity3 encourages women to maintain a commitment to the workplace without encouraging the workplace to maintain a commitment to them , ’ writes @entity22			1
she also compares the lean in ‘ movement ’ that @entity3 is seeking to establish with @entity4 ’s tendency to clone or acquire potential threats			1
‘ by launching a feminist platform , @entity3 is able to contain the broader threat that a feminist critique poses to @entity4 ’s business , simultaneously generating more power for herself and her organization - @entity63 ' revolution ' at its finest			1
this manoeuvre , as i learned in my years at @entity4 , is how the game is played , and both @entity3 and @entity24 play it well			1
’ tweet of shame : @entity22 sent a photograph of the rude message she received from @entity3 's publicist @entity16 @entity22 also sent this tweet about the reaction she received from @entity16 author : @entity3 's new book @entity31 will be out on bookstore shelves on march 11 the review is unlikely to been well received by either @entity3 or @entity24 and @entity16 was quick to seek some retaliation : ‘ there ’s a special place in hell for you , ’ she tweeted			1
since the controversial book launched earlier this month , @entity3 , 43 , has taken time out from her busy job at @entity4 to carry out a media tour to promote it			1
on the eve of its release , she spoke with @entity89 ’ ’ @entity90 , ’ about the challenges that modern women face , and said that they are stalled in their rise to power			0
herself a @entity95 graduate with a very impressive resume , she currently works as @entity4 ’s number two in command – right next to its founder , @entity24			1
but what ’s been getting the most attention is her crusade to bring awareness to workplace inequality , and the strains put upon working women who also want to have families			1
@entity3 has suggested that there are so few women running companies because they self - impose limits			2
the title of her book is derived from a 2010 @entity115 talk where she said that women hurt themselves by leaning back			2
‘ they say , i ’m busy or i want to have a child one day , i could n’t possibly take on any more			0
' or i ’m still learning my current job			0
i ’ve never heard a man say that to me , ’ @entity3 said			2
@entity3 herself was admittedly reluctant to accept her high school yearbook ’s award after she was voted ‘ most likely to succeed			0
’ ‘ i was embarrassed , ’ the mother of two said			0
‘ my entire life i have been told … or i have felt that i should hold back on being too successful , too smart , too – you know – lots of things			0
’ but the coo made it clear that she is not blaming professional women for the lack of female executives in the workforce			0
a woman on the move : @entity3 , 43 , launched her book earlier this month and was featured on a recent cover of @entity140 ‘ there ’s an awful lot we do n’t control			2
i ’m saying that there ’s an awful lot we can control and we can do for ourselves to sit at more tables , raise more hands			0
’ she also said that while marriage is the largest personal decision a person can make in their lives , choosing a spouse has extreme implications in the workplace too			0
‘ partner with the right person because you can not have a full career and a full life at home with the children if you are also doing all the housework and childcare			0
’ @entity3 has most recently been in @entity165 to promote her book			2
in a whirlwind of publicity , she has also been featured in @entity168 and appears on the march 18 cover of @entity140			0
controversy : @entity3 has not helped herself with divisive speeches in which she has said : ' the moment a woman starts thinking about having a child , she does n't raise her hand anymore ' speaking out : @entity4 chief operating officer @entity175 , who has a personal fortune of $ 500million , says that there were things beyond the control of women that were holding them back the @entity4 guru , who was ranked by @entity183 as the tenth most powerful woman in the @entity185 , has been criticized for being out - of - touch with the modern working woman because of her extreme wealth			1
according to @entity183 , @entity3 made nearly $ 31million in 2011 , including her base salary for @entity4 and around $ 30million in stock options			2
@entity3 told @entity190 in the interview : ' i am not saying everyone has the resources or opportunities i have			0
i am not saying every husband is going to wake up tomorrow , read a book and do his share			0
i 'm saying that women need to own the power that they have , negotiate for raises			0

@entity4 coo @entity3 's new book ' @entity31 ' and its advice for working women has met with mixed reviews
former @entity24 speechwriter @entity22 has written a highly negative critique of it which also attacked her former boss
the review prompted the @entity16 , a former @entity4 pr who is helping to promote the book , to send her the mean tweet
