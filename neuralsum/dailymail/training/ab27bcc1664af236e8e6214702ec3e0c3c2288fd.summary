by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 22:33 est , 23 october 2012 updated : 02:44 est , 25 october 2012 @entity2 was at war with his own senior law officer last night after insisting that prisoners would not be given the vote			0
attorney general @entity7 was said to be ‘ furious ’ with the prime minister ’s stance			1
last night there was speculation that mr @entity7 could even resign his government role if the prime minister fails to respect the ‘ rule of law ’ and do as he wishes			1
collision course : @entity2 ( left ) has insisted that prisoners will not be given the vote , opposing his own senior law officer , attorney general @entity7 ( right ) the prime minister told @entity20 that @entity21 would not capitulate to demands by the @entity23 for inmates to be enfranchised			1
he told @entity20 : ‘ no one should be in any doubt – prisoners are not getting the vote under this government			0
’ his comments were seen as a swift slap - down for mr @entity7 , the @entity31 ’s most senior legal adviser			1
only minutes earlier mr @entity7 had claimed that @entity21 ’s reputation would be damaged if it did not adhere to the ruling by @entity34 , which dates back to 2005			1
mr @entity7 , who claimed it was technically possible for @entity21 to be booted out of the @entity36 , said : ‘ the @entity21 has an enviable reputation in relation to human rights standards and adherence			1
‘ i have no doubt that it would be seen by other countries as a move away from our strict adherence to human rights laws			0
’ slapdown : the prime minister told @entity20 that @entity21 would not capitulate to demands by the @entity23 for inmates to be enfranchised mr @entity7 argued that refusing inmates the vote ‘ would be costly to the @entity21 ’ as @entity34 would almost certainly award them compensation worth tens of millions of pounds			1
mr @entity7 added that , while the government could choose not to pay , that ‘ would be a further breach of the obligations ’			1
he added : ‘ the issue is whether the @entity21 wishes to be in breach of its international obligations and what that does to the reputation of the @entity21			2
’ the remarks by mr @entity7 infuriated backbench @entity64 mps			1
they insist it is nonsense to suggest @entity21 could be thrown out of the @entity36 , which has failed to suspend the membership of countries such as @entity68 and @entity69 which are guilty of flagrant abuses of human rights			2
mps also point out that the overwhelming majority of mps voted last year to maintain the @entity21 ’s historic ban on prisoner voting and say @entity34 must respect the sovereignty of @entity76			2
the latest day of drama over prisoner voting was prompted by claims that the government was prepared finally to reach a settlement with @entity34			0
to the anger of @entity20 , it was reported that mr @entity7 had persuaded mr @entity2 of the need to introduce a @entity86 giving at least a limited number of convicts the vote			1
but the claims were immediately rejected by @entity91 and insiders at the @entity93			0
later , at @entity47 ’s questions in the @entity95 , mr @entity2 said : ‘ i do n’t want prisoners to have the vote , and they should not have the vote			0
‘ if it helps by having another vote in @entity76 on another resolution to make absolutely clear , to help put the legal position beyond doubt , i am very happy to do that			0
’ a @entity64 source said mr @entity7 had gone public with his concerns after becoming frustrated with mr @entity2 ’s refusal to accept his advice on prisoner voting			1
he is backed in the @entity31 by former justice secretary @entity108			0
opposition : @entity2 ( left ) has said the vote idea makes him feel ' physically sick ' , while @entity21 @entity112 leader @entity111 ( right ) was shocked by ministers even considering giving concessions to the court the source said : ‘ for @entity7 the rule of law is the key issue			2
the legal advice is very clear that the @entity21 has to abide by the court ’s ruling			0
there are different ways of doing it , but we can not just say no – it may be popular politically in the short term , but legally it is madness and even the popularity of it may fade when we start having to pay compensation to murderers			0
’ a senior @entity81 source insisted that mr @entity2 ’s stance did not conflict with the government ’s legal advice			0
the source said : ‘ the attorney general ’s arguments are slightly difficult to penetrate – he says lots of different things			2
‘ the focus has been on his concerns , but he does point out that parliament is sovereign and that there is flexibility in this			0
