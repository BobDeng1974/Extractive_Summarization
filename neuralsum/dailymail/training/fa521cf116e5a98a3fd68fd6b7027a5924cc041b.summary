by @entity0 last updated at 2:22 am on 24th september 2011 the date for the eviction at @entity4 ’s largest illegal traveller camp was becoming increasingly uncertain yesterday as legal challenges began to pile up			1
around 400 people on 51 plots at @entity8 in @entity9 , @entity10 , were due to be moved by bailiffs on monday			0
but a last - minute injunction was granted by the @entity13 in @entity14 after supporters of the travellers exploited a loophole involving the removal of structures not mentioned in an earlier court order			1
' brightening up the court ' : the @entity22 continues at the @entity13 today , where five sisters wore matching floral tops in a ' show of solidarity ' day out : @entity8 residents pictured leaving their site and making their way to the @entity13 hopeful : @entity8 travellers @entity31 ( left ) and @entity32 await a court ruling on their eviction five sisters who live at @entity8 wore identical patterned blouses to show ' solidarity ' at yesterday 's hearing and mr @entity39 congratulated them for their ' lovely turnout '			1
the @entity41 launched a series of extra legal challenges which will postpone a decision over an eviction to at least next week			1
the travellers won a last - gasp injunction on monday which prevented @entity48 from clearing the @entity50 's largest illegal site			1
the authority was told by @entity52 that it had to specify what it wanted to do on each of the 51 unauthorised plots - which it has now done			0
travellers had also launched two legal actions - relating to questions about whether the council was acting in accordance with the terms of enforcement notices issued - and , secondly , calling for a review of the validity of the notices			2
if the council was successful at today 's hearing , clearing of the site could have started as early as tomorrow			1
but reports from the court at lunch - time suggested a decision would not be made until next week ' at the earliest '			2
this is because a judge was told more legal challenges were being launched as he considered whether to extend an injunction preventing the council from clearing the site			1
in addition to today 's legal action , it emerged that at least two applications for judicial review were planned as part of the campaign to stop the evictions of travellers			2
if they go ahead , the applications could add thousands of pounds more to the already huge legal bill generated by the @entity8 saga			1
five sisters who live at @entity8 donned identical short - sleeved blouses to show ' solidarity ' at today 's hearing			0
the @entity32 sisters - @entity97 , 38 , @entity98 , 40 , @entity99 , 46 , @entity100 , 50 , and @entity101 , 55 - wore blue and pink floral - patterned tops as they sat in the front row of @entity104			0
mr @entity39 congratulated the ' ladies for their lovely turnout ' and added : ' it is very nice to see somebody brightening up the court			1
' day out : residents , including @entity111 ( centre ) , pose for the cameras before setting off to hear their fate at the @entity13 @entity115 , who lives on @entity8 , said before the start of today 's hearing : ' we 're just keeping our fingers crossed - praying for a good result			1
we do n't know what 's going to happen			0
' bailiffs working for @entity48 had planned to start the clearance of the six - acre site on monday , but the operation - which is estimated to be costing more than £ 1 million per day - was postponed while the legal wrangling was resolved			1
council leader @entity127 said he was frustrated by the delay but added he was convinced the injunction would be overturned once the authority presented the full facts			0
the clearance of @entity8 follows a decade - long row over unauthorised pitches			0
there are 34 legal pitches on the @entity138 site			2
taking a stand : travellers ' children pose with their message ' @entity143 , we hate eviction ' after writing it on a blackboard at the entrance to @entity8 settlemen plain talking : the children showed what the move will do to them and show banners protesting at the eviction travelling : wearing more sombre attire , these @entity8 residents were also pictured leaving their site this morning confident : @entity8 residents flash the ' @entity160 ' sign as they prepare to leave for the @entity13 members of the @entity163 on @entity164 , meeting at the @entity165 in headquarters in @entity167 , has written to the traveller community of @entity8 expressing sympathy , it emerged last night			1
the letter was signed by more than 30 representatives from different countries			0
it said : ' repressive policies targeting @entity175 and @entity41 disguised as planning regulations are discriminatory , whilst inclusive national strategies that are in line with human rights standards generate real progress in addressing issues of exclusion and marginalisation			0
' back at @entity8 a resident waiting for the court ruling adjusts the aerial on a television anxious : others sit , awaiting any news from @entity14 , pouring cups of tea lock down : activists were this morning shutting the barricade of the main gate to @entity8 some travellers had left the site last week in anticipation of the clearance but have returned this week in the hope they will be allowed to remain			2
they upped sticks and set an illegal camp 55 miles away , leading residents to fear that many more were on their way			0
around 20 families moved from @entity10 to @entity206 , close to @entity207 in @entity208 , after gaining access to a 100 - hectare piece of land			0
unlikely friendship : the former bare - knuckle boxer @entity213 , who has struck up a bond with @entity215 , wife of the @entity216 , is backing the travellers of @entity8 @entity48 has suggested a variety of temporary flats and houses over the past six months in an effort to resolve the decade - long stand - off			2
but they were turned down for reasons including because they smelled of smoke or were made of bricks and mortar , ' contravening ' the travellers ' desire to spend their life on the road			2
fifty - one plots containing homes built without planning permission are set to be cleared from the six - acre site , along with their remaining residents , in an operation which could cost £ 18million danger : a sign of the barricade at @entity8 warning that the 18 - year - old girl attached by her neck will be killed if bailiffs open the gate dangerous protest : an 18 - year - old known only as @entity246 , right , is attached to a scaffolding pole with a bike lock around her neck			0
she and fellow protester @entity249 , left , are also handcuffed together inside the barrel			0

decision today is ' unlikely ' and will probably be made on monday
injunction stopping clearing of site ' likely ' to be extended
travellers launching ' even more ' legal challenges
legal bill to increase ' *substantially* '
residents pictured making their way to @entity13
judge compliments travellers wearing matching tops for their ' lovely turnout '
@entity48 may start site clearance today if successful
