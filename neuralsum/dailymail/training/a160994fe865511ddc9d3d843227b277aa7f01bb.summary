by @entity1 correspondent tv presenter @entity2 is preparing to buy the @entity3 with the backing of a group of wealthy investors to save it from ‘ inevitable disaster ’ , he claimed yesterday			1
the former @entity3 star – who now hosts @entity10 on @entity11 – said renewing the corporation ’s current licence fee agreement would be ‘ as futile as giving medicine to a corpse			1
’ instead , he wants to turn it into a not - for - profit broadcaster run along commercial lines and slim down its ‘ bloated ’ bureaucracy			1
@entity2 rose to fame when he started out as a dj on @entity22 - but now he has his sights set on a promotion after he has said that he would now like to part - own the corporation the 65 - year - old said he has assembled a group of rich backers under the name @entity30 , after the corporation ’s first director general @entity31			2
he insisted they ‘ could and would pay ’ the market price of the @entity3 , as calculated by a team of advisers and former @entity3 executives			2
he said that finding the money to buy the corporation would not be a problem			0
’ writing in @entity41 , mr @entity2 said that he had meetings with business people across the globe and they all believed that a business model could be found to save the @entity3			2
he said : ‘ believe me , these people can make it happen			0
if ailing @entity50 companies such as @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54 can be turned around , there is still hope for the @entity3			0
’ mr @entity2 first found fame on @entity22 before hosting tv shows including @entity57 and @entity2 's @entity58			0
but he quit in 1999 , publicly criticising the corporation ’s management culture			0
in the past , he has refused to pay the licence fee in protest at the ‘ threatening ’ way in which it is collected			1
yesterday , the star claimed the @entity3 could face a mass ‘ licence fee revolt ’ and could collapse if just five per cent of households refused to pay the £ 145.50 annual charge			1
@entity2 blasted the ' bloated bureaucracy ' at the @entity3 but said that there is still hope for the organisation he said that he believes people ' deserve better ' than the current organisation			1

my @entity82 declined to say how much it would cost to buy out the @entity3 , although experts have said its commercial arm , @entity88 , is worth about £ 2billion alone			0
a @entity3 spokesman said : ‘ long - term polling shows that the licence fee is the funding method with single most backing and it ’s been rising			1
‘ support for the licence fee is at 53 % - way ahead of subscription and advertising			1
