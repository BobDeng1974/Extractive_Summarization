@entity7 was suffering from congenital high airway obstruction syndrome ( @entity9 ) - a rare condition which was preventing his lungs from expelling fluid through the trachea and causing his heart to fail			1
the outcome seemed inevitable , until his mother 's doctors stumbled across a potentially life - saving procedure that was yet to prove successful - until now			1
@entity19 : doctors in @entity2 have confirmed @entity7 , now 10 - months - old and content in his mothers arms , suffered no brain damage as a result of the risky foetal surgery @entity7 survived the procedure and medics in @entity2 confirmed yesterday that the baby - now 10 months old - sustained no brain damage as a result of the operation			1
it makes it the world 's first successful operation to remove an obstruction of a larynx from a foetus			2
@entity7 's parents , @entity40 and @entity41 , both 35 , told how doctors had initially advised them to have an abortion when they discovered their unborn baby was suffering from the rare condition			1
healthy : surgeons operated on @entity7 while he was still in his mother 's womb the build up of fluid inside the foetus ' body was compressing his heart and causing it to fail			1
but then their doctor in @entity57 heard about a team at a @entity60 research hospital that had performed three operations in a bid to save unborn babies diagnosed with @entity9			0
all three procedures had proved unsuccessful , but nonetheless it was a glimmer of light for @entity7 's devastated parents			0
' we came to @entity60 without any hope , ' mr @entity41 told the @entity70			0
' they gave us an option and a chance			0
' after finding out about the technique the couple , from @entity76 , endured a ' difficult ' and ' emotional ' seven day wait before ms @entity40 went into surgery at the @entity60			0
the team first manoeuvred the foetus into position inside the uterus - the most difficult part of the procedure - before three surgeons spent 22 minutes removing the membrane blocking @entity7 's larynx			2
@entity88 , head of the unit in @entity60 , explained surgeons were able to perforate the membrane ' quite easily ' , adding that getting access to the mother 's uterus and in turn the baby 's trachea was the part loaded with risk			2
' one move a millimetre to the wrong side of the larynx could have caused serious problems , ' he said			0
in total the operation has been performed on four other occasions globally , but in each of those cases the babies either died or suffered brain damage or serious respiratory problems , the @entity70 report said			0
after receiving @entity7 's clean bill of health , his emotional parents have said they are looking forward to enjoying life with their ' fit and healthy ' son .			2
