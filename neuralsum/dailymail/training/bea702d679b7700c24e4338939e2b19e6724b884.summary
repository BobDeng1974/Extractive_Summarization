a frog has survived being swallowed whole and then spat out by a snake in north @entity3			1
zoologist and snake catcher @entity4 says the one metre - long tree snake regurgitated the green tree frog in an attempt to make a quick getaway when she tried to remove it from a yard in @entity11 , western @entity12			1
' i just picked it up and then realised it was about to regurgitate something , ' she told @entity17 on monday			0
' i thought maybe it had eaten a rat but it then vomited out a green tree frog backwards			1
this frog survived an incredible ordeal after it was swallowed by a snake and escaped alive in one piece ' it just popped onto the ground and it was covered in spit and other snake stomach juices			2
' to her surprise , the frog then started to move			2
' the frog then took a breath			0
so i rinsed it off and it pretty much looked like a brand new frog , ' she said			0
' he sat there a little bit stunned and i think he went and sat somewhere quiet for a while			0
' ms @entity4 , who has been working as a part - time snake catcher for the past two years , believes the snake regurgitated its meal so it could make a quick getaway			0
the snake ( not pictured ) vomited up the frog which to zoologist @entity4 's surprise started to move ' i guess it 's easier to do that on an empty stomach , ' she said , adding that she released the snake in nearby bushland after the ordeal last saturday			1
ms @entity4 says the frog may have survived because it can hold its breath for a long time and it 's likely it had only been inside the snake for a couple of minutes			1
it was also lucky because the snake was n't venomous and eats its prey alive			0
' i think the frog will survive but i think the snake was a bit disappointed he lost his breakfast , ' ms @entity4 said .			2
