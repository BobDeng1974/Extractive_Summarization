she might have just become a mother for the fifth time but it seems @entity4 , 36 , has no intention of putting her feet up			1
between writing a new book , signing up with a hair colour brand and slamming @entity10 's naked magazine cover , the former glamour model has found time to create a new fragrance named ' @entity13 '			2
' it 's my first evening fragrance that i 've released and i love it , ' she said in an exclusive interview with @entity17			2
' @entity4 , 36 , who gave birth to her fifth child in august , also said that not only are the orange and peach notes ' gorgeous ' , she 's been getting plenty of compliments while wearing it			1
but it is the name of the fragrance , @entity13 , that most reflects ms @entity4 , who said it was inspired by her personality			2
' i think the name @entity21 is quite reflective of my personality , ' she explained			1
' i 'm the most loyal person and fun - loving and kind but if people take advantage of those good qualities i can have a fierce side that comes out too			0
' one for the @entity45 stocking ? @entity4 's new fragrance is just the latest in a roster of celebrity scents but she maintains that hers is different and she apparently gets plenty of compliments when she wears it moving on : @entity4 , pictured at the launch of her last fragrance , says her latest creation is her best yet and she wanted to create something that her fans would love and despite being one of a veritable deluge of celebrity fragrances , @entity4 says hers is different - and it 's all down to her experience of the showbiz world			1
' i 've been doing this for a long time , ' she explained			0
' my perfumes have been best sellers and i 'm involved in every aspect of the production as well			0
' i started creating @entity21 a year ago and wanted to bring out an affordable , long lasting evening perfume that my fans would like			1
' the perfume is , she says , an extension of her changing lifestyle and reflects the more mature , more sophisticated woman she is today			2
indeed , the 36 - year - old claims that she 's so disinterested in beautifying herself - apart from for public appearances - that the only thing in her make - up bag is a tub of @entity80			1
' the older you get , the less interested in make - up you are			0
a smokey eye is ageing and with five kids , the last thing on my mind is make - up , ' says @entity4			0
' in fact , i do n't wear any			0
@entity80 is the only thing in my make - up bag to keep my lips moisturised			0
' so what does ' beauty ' mean to the star ? ' my children and relaxing at home with them and having quality time			1
' @entity99 natural : the 36 - year - old maintains that she 's so disinterested in beautifying herself these days - apart from for public appearances - that the only thing in her make - up bag is a tub of @entity80 family is clearly important to @entity4 , who has managed to overcome husband @entity105 's infidelity and presented a united front at the recent @entity108 premiere in @entity109			1
she also used the glamorous night as a platform to show off her post-baby body , which , as photos reveal , is more toned than ever			2
' i 'm quite good at eating healthily but biscuits are my weakness , ' she admits			1
' the day starts off well with a freshly made juice but it goes downhill , usually in the evening			0
' this is the problem with my fitness - i come up with all these ideas to work out and then i literally do n't have time			0
' i 'm working on the release of @entity21 , i 'm @entity124 for @entity125 , i 've also got to factor in writing my next autobiography , which i 'm doing at the moment , and then tv work and my tv role for @entity130 in @entity131 plus the kids , my husband and family and friends			1
' still with us ? good , because she is also working on a photo call for the perfume , penning her next tome , celebrating @entity142 ’s 50th anniversary with the @entity144 team , doing ' something that has n't been done before ' and heading over to @entity131 again - all in the next few months			2
