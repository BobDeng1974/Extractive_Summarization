scientists have uncovered what they believe to be the oldest complete fossil anywhere on @entity3			1
the 3.5 billion year old fossil is the remains of what was once a purple and green slimy collection of single - cell microbes			1
these microbes are likely to be a distant ancestor of humans and would have had a strong stench of rotting eggs , according to researchers			1

mound - like deposits created by ancient bacteria , called stromatolites , and microfossils of bacteria have previously been discovered in this region			2
however , a phenomenon called microbially induced sedimentary structures , or @entity39 , had not previously been seen in rocks of this great age miss not only demonstrate the presence of life , but also the presence of microbial ecosystems that could co-ordinate with one another			2
@entity47 of @entity48 in the @entity49 found the remnants of this life in sandstone rock in western @entity24			1
the tiny fossilised mat , about one - third of an inch ( 8.3 millimetres ) thick , would be about 300 million years older than previous complete ancient fossils , said study co-author @entity56 , a mineralogist at the @entity57 in @entity58			1
he said life on the mat probably had turned sunlight into energy , but produced ‘ horribly smelly ’ sulphur in the process , instead of oxygen			2
he added that if you had walked the @entity68 beaches of 3.5 billion years ago , you would see a ‘ slimy mass of purple or brown fibres emitting this stench of sulphur compounds but living very happily			0
’ ‘ this is not a place you would want to go to on your summer vacation , ’ he said			0
the @entity23 district of @entity24 , where the fossil was found , is famous for giving scientists insight into the early evolution of life			1
a phenomenon called microbially induced sedimentary structures , or miss , had not previously been seen in this region			0
these structures are formed from mats of microbial material , much like mats seen today on stagnant waters or in coastal flats however , a phenomenon called microbially induced sedimentary structures , or miss , had not previously been seen in this region			0
these structures are formed from mats of microbial material - much like mats seen today on stagnant waters or in coastal flats			0
researchers believe the sedimentary structures arose from the interactions of bacterial films with shoreline sediments from the region			0
‘ the structures give a very clear signal on what the ancient conditions were , and what the bacteria composing the biofilms were able to do , ’ said professor @entity47			0
miss are among the targets of @entity108 rovers , which search for similar formations on the red planet 's surface			0
the discovery could now help inform further searches for life on @entity108 , where such remnants of life may be even better preserved			0
the @entity23 region of @entity24 is one of the rare geological regions that provides insight into the early evolution of life on @entity3			2

fossil found in sandstone belonged to foul - smelling single - celled microbes
these microbes were likely to be a distant ancestor of humans beings
they are thought to be 300 million years older than the previous oldest example of life on @entity3
