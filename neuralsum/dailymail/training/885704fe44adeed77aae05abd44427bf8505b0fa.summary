' meanwhile there is a clear difference in the motivations for voters on the two camps – yes voters saying they are motivated more by hope for the future if their side wins , while no voters say fear for the future if the no side loses has been more important to their vote			0

i hope it remains strong , robust and united			0
’ but tennis star @entity105 , who has for weeks refused to take sides , came off the fence in a tweet saying : ‘ let ’s do this ! ’ he said he had been turned away from the ‘ no ’ campaign because of its ‘ negativity ’			0
he wrote : ‘ huge day for @entity1 today ! no campaign negativity last few days totally swayed my view on it			2
excited to see the outcome			0
lets [ sic ] do this ! ’ the independence campaign is set to go down to the wire today - with the public split down the middle over whether to stay in the @entity93 or become ' an independent country '			1
