@entity0 has brought back its iconic @entity1 as a high - definition audio player in a bid to win back users who listen to music on their smartphone			1
the firm hopes its high resolution audio device will convince listeners to switch back to a dedicated music player , but it is predicted to cost £ 950 ( $ 1,443 )			1
the @entity11 resurrects the iconic brand , first introduced in july 1979 , with a @entity14 capacity and 60 - hour battery life			1
the @entity1 resurrects the iconic brand , with a 128gb capacity and 60 hour battery life			1
' for a while there was a novelty in carrying 10,000 songs in your pocket , ' said @entity0 's @entity22 at the @entity23 in @entity24			1
' now , people are seeking a higher quality experience			1
' @entity0 also revealed a huge number of other high resolution audio hi - fi , speaker and headphones at the show			1
other manufacturers are also beginning to focus more on high quality music files			1
' the new @entity1 is a great example of the quality of hi - res audio , it is tailored for outstanding sound , ' said mr @entity22			1
' i 'm sure everyone here is not ready to delete their @entity43 library - and we 've got you covered			1
' you 'll be able to elevate the audio quality of your existing library			2
the old and the new : @entity0 's new ' we can add quality , depth and more emotions to the cherished tunes in your collection			1
' however , experts say @entity0 has a tough fight on its hands , ' there is clearly a resurgence it getting back to music in the purest way , ' said @entity61 of @entity62			2
' if there is one brand that can associate with that it is the @entity1			0
' however the question is whether there is enough of an appetite for enough people to justify bringing it back			0
' the original ' @entity1 ' , model @entity70 300 , made by @entity0 @entity0 has sold 220 million cassette @entity1 players globally since the product 's july 1979 debut that changed lifestyles by popularising music on the go			2
legend has it that the device was first built in 1978 by @entity0 engineer @entity81 for @entity0 co-chairman @entity82 , who wanted to be able to listen to operas during his frequent trans - @entity86 plane trips			1
a massive hit for the entire 1980s and early 1990s the @entity1 was eventually superseded by the emerging digital technologies of @entity89 , @entity90 and @entity0 ’s own minidisc			2
more than 30 years later , the cassette @entity1 has been rendered an anachronism by @entity43 players and ipods			2
demand for cassette players in @entity98 is now largely limited to elderly users			0
@entity0 will continue production of the cassette @entity1 in @entity102 to accommodate users abroad , including in the @entity103 , @entity104 and some @entity106 countries			2
the @entity1 brand has continued in name only as part of the firm 's mobile phone range			0
@entity112 also joined the hi - fi battle			0
the search giant is set to bring its $ 35 @entity116 dongle to hifi systems			2
the firm today revealed a major new push into audio designed to take on @entity121			0
it plans to partner with hi - fi firms to create speakers for the service , and today revealed it will already work with speakers connected to a tv			0
currently the system allows people to play back video from sites such as @entity134			0
however , @entity112 is now bringing the same technology behind its popular $ 35 @entity136 into speakers , soundbars and a / v receivers			0
it says users will be able to ' cast ' audio wirelessly from a variety of apps on your @entity145 or @entity146 smartphone , or the @entity148 , in a similar fashion to the way people with a @entity116 stream video			0
' just like @entity116 , simply tap the cast button in your favorite music or radio app on @entity145 , @entity146 , or the web , and select a @entity158 speaker to get the party started			0
' similar to the video service , users can use their phone to control the music , which is then played directly through the speaker from cloud services , meaning they can use their phone for other things			0
@entity168 , global director of gadget insurer @entity169 , told @entity170 : ' retro gadgets do seem to be making a comeback of late , but this is not the original @entity173 , or , indeed , anything like it			0
' the original @entity1 was innovative for its time , while this music player comes post @entity178			0
' convincing people to carry one of these and a smartphone , even with the lure of top quality audio and a 60 - hour battery life , may be a struggle			1

@entity0 says high resolution audio will be far better than smartphone sound
@entity190 - @entity11 will have a @entity14 capacity and 60 - hour battery life
the device is set to cost £ 950 ( $ 1,443 ) but has not yet been *confirmed*
firm claims *consumers* are ' seeking a higher quality experience ' than @entity43
