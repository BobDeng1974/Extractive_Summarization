the fossil was discovered a few years ago at @entity8 in @entity9 , but has only recently been analysed by scientists , who identified the hair			1
@entity9 researchers believe the hyenas either actively hunted our ancestors living 257,000 - years - ago or scavenged some dead bodies , ingesting hair			1

pictured is a block of calcified cave sediment containing part of the hyena latrine , showing the largest piece of fossilised faeces @entity9 researchers believe the hyenas either hunted our ancestors living 257,000 - years - ago or scavenged dead bodies and ingested the hair			1
however , they have not ruled out that the animal just fancied a snack of human hair that it found somewhere @entity8 , is a fossil - bearing cave located about 13 km @entity33 of the well known @entity9 hominid - bearing sites of @entity35 and @entity36 and about 45 km @entity37 of the @entity38 , @entity9			1
it is a complex cave system made up of several underground chambers reaching a depth of about 65 metres			0
it is situated within the @entity43			0
many thousands of fossils have been recovered from the @entity8 deposits including rare remains of hominids			0
almost a quarter of a million bones have been recovered from the external @entity8 deposits since excavations began in 1992			0
fossils recovered include antelope , giant zebra , carnivores including extinct wolves , monkeys and hominids attributed to @entity58 and early @entity59			0

the fossilised faeces was part of a ' hyena latrine ' discovered in a cave located in the @entity68 in @entity9 , according to researchers at the @entity70			1

@entity74 and @entity75 , authors of the research published in the @entity78 , said brown hyenas roamed the savannah grasslands , like they do today			0
other hairs demonstrated that the animals shared their environment with warthogs , zebra , impala , and kudu , as well as hominins - a tribe of our ancestors			1
the scientists focused on examining scale patterns and cross sections of hair to identify the fossilised hairs			0
the fossil was discovered a few years ago at @entity8 in @entity9 ( pictured is the @entity8 walkway ) , but has only recently been analysed by scientists , who identified the hair the researchers said : ' a lack of hair scales has been documented in human hair subject to pathology			1
they even suggested that our ancestors had many a bad hair day , because of ' abrasion of the hair resulting from inhabiting rock crevices ' that could have reduced the number of scales found on the hairs			1
a total of 48 hairs were extracted from the 12 fossils using fine tweezers and were examined using a scanning electron microscope			0
they identified the origins of the hairs using standard guides as well as comparing them to a collection of samples from 15 indigenous southern @entity9 mammals			2
the findings support previous tentative identifications of fossilised human hairs and give scientists a better picture of the local @entity131 mammal community as well as an insight into the environment in which archaic and emerging modern humans in the interior of the @entity9 subcontinent lived .			2
