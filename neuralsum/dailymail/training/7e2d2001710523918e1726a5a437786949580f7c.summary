sprinter @entity0 holds up his @entity2 pass , with a photos of someone completely different he 's one of the most talked - about @entity6 athletes competing in the @entity2 and @entity8 's great hope in the 100metres			1
but someone in the @entity12 security team has n't read all the hype about teenage sprinter @entity0			1
when the running sensation arrived in @entity17 to pick up his games pass - it had a photo of someone completely different on it			1
the confused junior world champion posted a photo of his pass , and the mystery man , on his @entity26 page - and asked followers for help identifying the fake @entity0			1
he wrote : ' my @entity2 accreditation to get into the games , who even is this guy ? ! ? ! ? ' many of @entity34 's track and field stars have been based at a training camp in @entity36 , and are arriving at the @entity37 just days before they 're due to compete			1
and organisers admit @entity40 's mix - up was n't an isolated incident			0
particularly after a series of security fiascoes			0
@entity45 deputy chef de mission , sir @entity44 , told @entity46 : ' it 's happened a few times to be fair and i 've tried to meet most athletes when they arrive to solve any problems			1
' it is a big issue from a security point of view as the picture has to match the person so i know we 've dealt with it as it came to us last night			0
' the 18 - year - old is being hailed as one of @entity8 's ' golden generation ' of future superstars , but he only started running seriously in january			2
the @entity61 , who is currently studying a @entity63 diploma in sport at @entity65 , only quit football last november to focus on running			0
before that the teenager 's sporting career seemed destined to be played out on the football pitch rather than the running track			0
@entity0 raced to victory in the @entity72 last month , setting a new personal best of 10.05 the former @entity75 pupil - who is of @entity77 and @entity78 descent - was signed up by @entity79 when he was just eight years old and spent seven years with the @entity81 champions before switching to his local club @entity82 and @entity83			2
he spent part of last season on loan at nearby @entity88 side @entity87 , but was still training with @entity82 and @entity83 until the end of the year , when he swapped his football boots for runners spikes			0
his transition to sprinter was complete earlier this month when @entity0 won the @entity72 with a phenomenal time of 10.05 seconds .			2

@entity45 chief @entity44 admits ' it 's happened a few times '
