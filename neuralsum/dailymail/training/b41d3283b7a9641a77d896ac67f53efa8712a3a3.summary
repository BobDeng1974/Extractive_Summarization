tearing open the wrapping on the gifts under her grandmother ’s tree , @entity0 squeals with delight at her new cuddly toys – @entity7 the snowman and his donkey sidekick @entity10 from @entity12 ’s hit film @entity13			1
@entity14 for this two - year - old has come early this year , but there is good reason for @entity0 ’s parents @entity18 and @entity20 choosing to spoil their daughter			1
for as other children open gifts on december 25 , @entity0 will be in hospital receiving a life - saving blood transfusion – her 31st such treatment since being diagnosed with a rare disorder , hereditary spherocytosis , within hours of being born			1
' this is number 30 ' : @entity0 , pictured with a sign indicating her 30th blood transfusion , will spend @entity14 receiving her 31st such treatment the disease causes the spleen – part of the immune system – to destroy red blood cells rather than create them			1
red blood cells are vital for carrying oxygen around the body			2
while a mild reduction in numbers , typically caused by a nutritional deficiency , simply causes fatigue or sometimes pain , in severe cases the organs can quickly become irreversibly damaged			0
@entity0 ’s first transfusion came when she was just 20 days old , and without having one every five weeks she would die			1
she is just one of thousands of patients who will need transfusions over the festive period , which is why @entity53 is urging would - be donors not to put off giving blood until the @entity56 – as many do – or miss their regular scheduled appointments			1
@entity18 , 39 , a production engineer for a plastics company , explains : ‘ from day one we ’ve seen how much @entity0 needs that blood			1
towards the end of the five - weekly cycle , she loses all her energy			2
then almost immediately after her transfusion it ’s like she ’s been recharged			2
‘ to think that strangers have given us this gift of life month after month is incredible			2
all our friends and family are donors and i do everything i can to encourage more people to donate , especially at this time of year when stocks can run low			0
’ there are about one million regular blood donors in @entity77 and @entity78 who have given blood at least once in the past year			1
appointment dates are generated automatically by computer			0
but last year , a fifth of appointments were missed over the festive period – a figure that could be even higher this year as @entity14 and @entity86 are followed by the weekend			1
blood ca n’t be frozen , and once donated it lasts for only 35 days			0
platelets – a constituent of blood commonly used to help those with leukaemia or other cancers – last for just seven days			0
‘ because of this turnover , more than 6,000 donors are needed every single day of the year			0
it ’s tough to maintain stocks at the best of times , ’ says @entity95 , of @entity53			1
there is pressure on stocks of certain blood types , particularly @entity105 as it can be received by those of all blood types in situations where there is n’t time to determine type , such as after a road accident			0
early presents : @entity0 opens her toys - @entity7 the snowman and his sidekick @entity10 from @entity12 ’s hit film frozen mr @entity95 says more than 200,000 blood donors and 12,500 platelet donors are needed this @entity14 to safeguard hundreds of thousands of patients			1
‘ on top of those who need regular transfusions , such as cancer patients , there ’s extra strain because of all the people suffering accidents with the cold weather and alcohol - related injuries around this time of year , ’ he says			2
‘ we ran a similar campaign in 2013 and got through it by actively emailing and calling regular donors , but with the longer break this @entity14 , the pressure is really on			0
’ he adds : ‘ we ’ve recently been running a know your type promotion in shopping centres and universities to test new people who have n’t donated before			0
we ’re always looking for new donors , particularly from the @entity143 , @entity144 , black @entity145 , @entity146 and @entity148 communities , which commonly have rare blood groups and are prone to blood disorders such as sickle cell anaemia			1
’ @entity0 , of @entity152 , @entity153 , is a @entity154 , a fairly common type , but for her first five transfusions she needed @entity157 as she was too young to ascertain which blood type she was			1
@entity18 recalls : ‘ my father , my elder daughter @entity160 , 15 , and i have the same condition , but in a milder form			0
i had my spleen removed when i was five , which was very young , but we ’ve been told @entity0 needs to have hers removed early next year			2
it ’s a very risky operation for someone so young , but it ’s the only long - term option we have			0
’ as well as transfusions , @entity0 is regularly admitted to @entity167 with complications related to her condition			1
‘ it ’s increasingly hard to get a needle into her veins because of all the scar tissue , ’ her father says			0
‘ it is very distressing but @entity0 takes it all in her stride			2
‘ we want to thank everyone who has ever given blood – and to anyone thinking about it , i urge you to do it			0
we do n’t mind that @entity0 ’s got to be in hospital on christmas day			2
without the transfusions , our little girl would n’t be with us to enjoy @entity14 at all			0
