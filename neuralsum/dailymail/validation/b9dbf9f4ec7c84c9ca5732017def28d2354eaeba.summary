humans started dominating the planet causing irreversible damage around the year 1610 , scientists claim			1
experts have been divided on when mankind caused a lasting impact on the @entity8 's geology with some suggesting 1964 when the fallout from atomic testing became apparent			2
but @entity12 researchers have now pinpointed 1610 because of the impact felt by an irreversible transfer of crops and species between the @entity17			1
@entity12 researchers have now pinpointed 1610 because of the impact felt by an irreversible transfer of crops and species between the @entity17 and @entity17 the anthropocene is the name of a proposed geological epoch that may soon enter the official @entity24			1
it refers to a time in which human permanently changed the planet			0
according to the @entity30 ( @entity30 ) , we are officially in the @entity31 , which began 11,700 years ago after the last major ice age			0
some experts argue we should now change the name to ' @entity21 '			2
this is from from @entity36 , for ' man , ' and cene , for ' new '			0
but up until now , experts have been divided on when mankind caused a lasting impact on the @entity8 's geology with some suggesting 1964 when the fallout from atomic testing became apparent			2
researchers at @entity45 said that 1610 - when @entity47 's @entity46 was first performed - marked the start of the human - dominated geological epoch known as the anthropocene			1
previous epochs began and ended due meteorite strikes , sustained volcanic eruptions and the shifting of the continents			0
the study , published in @entity58 , said human actions are now changing the planet producing a new geological epoch			2
but to define an epoch scientists must pinpoint and date a global environmental change that has been captured in natural material , such as rocks , ancient ice or sediment from the ocean floor			2
such a marker - like the chemical signature left by the meteorite strike that wiped out the dinosaurs - is called a golden spike			1
comparing the major environmental impacts of human activity over the past 50,000 years against these two formal requirements just two dates were in the running - 1610 when the impact of the discovery of the @entity76 began to be felt and 1964			1
scientists said the 1492 arrival of @entity83 in the @entity76 , and subsequent global trade , moved species to new continents and oceans on an unprecedented level , resulting in a global re-ordering of life on @entity8			1
they also found a golden spike that can be dated to the same time - a pronounced dip in atmospheric carbon dioxide centred on 1610 and captured in @entity95 ice - core records			1
geologists have named the 1610 dip in carbon dioxide the ' @entity99 '			1
they chose the @entity101 word for ' world ' because this golden spike was caused by once - disconnected peoples becoming globally linked			0
according to the @entity30 ( @entity30 ) , we are officially in the @entity31 , which began 11,700 years ago after the last major ice age humans started dominating the planet causing irreversible changes during the reign of @entity112 ( right ) and the era of @entity47 ( left ) , scientists claim dr @entity114 said : ' in a hundred thousand years scientists will look at the environmental record and know something remarkable happened in the second half of the second millennium			0
' they will be in no doubt that these global changes to @entity8 were caused by their own species			0
' today we can say when those changes began and why			0
' the @entity21 probably began when species jumped continents , starting when the @entity126 met the @entity127			0
' we humans are now a geological power in our own right - as @entity8 - changing as a meteorite strike			1
' historically , the collision of the @entity133 marks the beginning of the modern world			0
' many historians regard agricultural imports into @entity83 from the vast new lands of the @entity76 , alongside the availability of coal , as the two essential precursors of the @entity142 , which in turn unleashed further waves of global environmental changes			0
' geologically , this boundary also marks @entity8 's last globally synchronous cool moment before the onset of the long - term global warmth of the anthropocene			2
' he added while 1964 saw a peak in radioactive fallout following nuclear weapons testing , it was not - in geological terms - an @entity8 - changing event			1
an official decision on whether to formally recognise the @entity21 , including when it began , will be triggered by a recommendation of the @entity161 of the @entity162 , due in 2016			0
scientists said the 1492 arrival of @entity83 in the @entity76 ( pictured ) , and global trade , moved species to new continents and oceans on an unprecedented level , resulting in a global re-ordering of life on @entity8			1

date was decided on because of the impact felt by the transfer of crops
arrival of *smallpox* saw 50 million @entity179 die
a dip in atmospheric carbon dioxide centred on 1610 was also found
scientists argue this should now be regarded as start of @entity21
' we humans are now a geological power in our own right - as @entity8 - changing as a meteorite strike , ' the researchers said
