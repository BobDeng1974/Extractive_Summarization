but a heartbroken @entity10 last night said he wanted to mark the death of his brother @entity12 by remembering the man – not the legend			1
in an emotional tribute , he also revealed he had shared a ' spiritual ' moment with his sibling before his passing on friday , even though the two were n't together at the time			1
@entity12 died aged 74 on friday night brotherly love : @entity10 ( right ) has revealed he had shared a ' spiritual ' moment with his sibling before he died he said he had been listening to one of @entity12 ’s compositions just before he was told that his brother had died at the age of 74			1
‘ it was one of my favourite songs that @entity12 wrote , ' he said			1
' i took that as a special spiritual message from @entity12 saying goodbye			1
’ he added that the love he felt for his brother survived any personal difference they had – including an acrimonious split that reportedly lasted a decade			2
he said : ‘ our love was and will always be deeper than any earthly differences we might have had			2
‘ my wife @entity45 and i are touched by all the tributes we ’re seeing for @entity12 and we thank you for allowing us to grieve in private at this incredibly difficult time			1
’ @entity10 died on friday night			1
he had been suffering complications from a lung disease and was being treated in hospital in @entity53 , @entity54			1
tearful goodbye : @entity3 ( pictured in 2011 , right , and with wife @entity56 , left , at a @entity58 event in 2009 ) had been suffering complications from a lung disease his widow @entity56 , who blamed his death on a lifetime of cigarette smoking , said : ‘ we are absolutely heartbroken			1
he fought long and hard			2
’ the @entity3 were arguably the most influential vocal duo in music history			1
they brought their love of country music to rock ' n ' roll in the 1950s and 1960s , transforming the pop charts of the day and inspiring legions of young proto rockers like the @entity74 , @entity75 and the @entity76 who would go on to change popular culture			1
songs like ' @entity80 ' and ' @entity81 ' remain a shared memory for generations of listeners who were hooked by their deceptively simple harmonies that hid greater meaning in songs that were dark and new compared with the pop music of the day			2
the two broke up amid quarrelling in 1973 after 16 years of hits , then reunited in 1983 , ' sealing it with a hug , ' @entity3 had said at the time			1
there was a heavy outpouring on social media following @entity97 's death , proving @entity3 remain relevant a half - century after their first hits			1
legendary duo : along with his 76 - year - old brother @entity100 , the @entity3 still hold the record for the most top 100 singles by any duo in history he left a towering legacy that still inspires half a century after @entity3 ' first hit			1
one could argue that while @entity110 was the king of rock ` n ' roll , @entity12 and @entity10 were its troubled princes			1
they sang dark songs hidden behind deceptively pleasing harmonies and were perfect interpreters of the twitchy hearts of millions of baby boomer teens coming of age in the 1950s and ` 60s looking to express themselves beyond the simple platitudes of the pop music of the day			2
the @entity123 dealt in the entire emotional spectrum with an authenticity that appealed to proto rockers like the @entity74 and @entity75 , who gladly pass the credit for the sea changes they made in rock to the ruggedly handsome brothers			2
the @entity74 , the quartet whose pitch - perfect harmonies set the pop music world aflame , once referred to themselves as ' the @entity137			2
' and @entity75 , pop culture 's poet laureate , once said , ' we owe these guys everything			0
' two generations later , artists are still finding inspiration in the music			0
most recently , @entity148 's @entity147 and @entity149 lovingly recorded a tribute to the @entity123 and their unique album ' @entity152			0
' singing in heaven : the country crooners ' signature harmonies and steel - string guitars influenced the @entity74 , the @entity158 , @entity110 , @entity159 , @entity160 , and @entity161 ' there 's so much darkness in those old songs , ' @entity147 said recently			2
' i think mainly that 's just how people communicated when it came to mourning and loss			0
then with the @entity3 it sounds like these two little angels that sing			1
' that reaction was universal for the @entity174			0
their hit records included the then - titillating ' @entity81 ' and the era - identifying ' @entity80 , ' each featuring their twined voices with @entity178 and @entity180 's lyrics that mirrored the fatalism of country music and the rocking backbeat of modern pop music			2
these sounds and ideas would be warped by their devotees into a new kind of music that would ricochet around the world			0
listen to the @entity192 ' ' @entity191 , ' for instance , then the @entity74 's ' @entity194			0
' you 'll hear it right away			0
@entity197 also were strongly influenced by the @entity123 and recorded live versions of ' @entity80 ' and ' @entity81			0
' in all , the brothers ' career spanned five decades , although they performed separately from 1973 to 1983			0
in their heyday between 1957 and 1962 , they had 19 top 40 hits			0
' they had that sibling sound ' : 11 - time @entity206 winner @entity205 covered the brothers ' track @entity209 back in 1975 influential : sir @entity210 mentioned ' @entity12 and @entity100 ' in his song @entity212 , and @entity214 frontman @entity213 named his six - year - old son @entity10 although their number of hit records declined in the late 1980s , they made successful concert tours in this country and @entity221			1
they were inducted into the @entity224 in 1986 , the same year they had a hit pop - country record , ' born yesterday			2
' they also are members of the @entity58 , a nod to their heritage			0
@entity3 was born to folk and country music singers @entity231 and @entity232 on jan. 19 , 1939 , in @entity233 , two years after his older brother			1
as the sons of country and western singers , they had been performing since they were children and were the most country - oriented of the early rock giants			1
the brothers began singing country music in 1945 on their family 's radio show in @entity245 , @entity246 , and though their sound would become more cosmopolitan over time , they never strayed far from their country roots			2
@entity10 and @entity3 , @entity3 in 1970 - the brothers were hugely influential on acts such as @entity74 and @entity75 @entity10 said in a 1986 @entity251 interview that the two were successful because ' we never followed trends			1
we did what we liked and followed our instincts			0
rock ` n ' roll did survive , and we were right about that			2
@entity259 did survive , and we were right about that			0
you can mix the two but people said we could n't			0
' their breakup came dramatically during a concert at @entity266 in @entity267			0
@entity3 threw his guitar down and walked off , prompting @entity10 to tell the crowd , ' the @entity3 died 10 years ago			1
' during their breakup , they pursued solo singing careers with little fanfare			0
@entity12 also appeared in the @entity275 movie ' @entity276			1
' @entity3 last performed in public in 2011 , but his son @entity278 told @entity251 on friday he had been actively writing songs , living part of the year in @entity53 and the rest in @entity282			1
he said his father had been in the hospital for about two weeks when he passed away			0
together : in this 1984 file photo , @entity12 , left , and @entity10 , of the @entity3 joke around for photographers in @entity288			1
@entity10 , who with his brother @entity100 formed an influential harmony duo that touched the hearts and sparked the imaginations millions though the @entity294 caused by smoking affected his health , @entity293 said it never affected that voice			1
' he sang like an angel , ' his son said			0
' it was pretty surprising how he could still get those notes			0
we would still talk about it and sing together			0
' the inspiration attributed to the @entity123 ' voices brought the brothers together again in 2003 at the request of @entity197 , a duo known to fight bitterly as well			2
the resulting tour brought a chuckle from @entity311 in a @entity313 interview			0
' it was hilarious that the four of us were doing this tour , given our collective histories of squabbling , ' @entity311 said			0
' and it 's amazing , because they had n't seen each other in about three years			0
they met in the parking lot before the first gig			0
' they unpacked their guitars - those famous black guitars - and they opened their mouths and started to sing			0
and after all these years , it was still that sound i fell in love with as a kid			0
