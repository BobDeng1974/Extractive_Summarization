by @entity0 published : 10:27 est , 15 november 2012 updated : 11:56 est , 15 november 2012 he ’s knocked his opponents senseless in the ring but @entity4 admitted defeat in a bear - knuckle confrontation with a koala in @entity8 , @entity9			1
the former world heavyweight champion , 46 , threw in the towel when he was given the chance of cuddling a koala called @entity14 , declaring that she might just put the bite on him			1
that , he was anxious to make clear , was in no way meant as a reminder of his famous ear - bite of @entity22			2
not sure about this : @entity4 weights up the pros and cons of cuddling a koala in @entity8 , @entity9 ‘ i ’ve seen the tv show @entity30 , ’ he said as his excuse for not taking @entity14 into his arms , even though he once owned three tigers			1
apart from being concerned about those claws , he added : ‘ they also carry bacteria			2
’ so having conceded defeat in the first round of a ‘ friendly ’ with the koala , he was anxious to make the point that he was in @entity9 to spread the message that people should try to ignore the bad times			1
not a chance ! the former boxer would n't give the koala a cuddle , for fear of getting scratched or bitten when good animals turn bad : the legendary world heavyweight champion once owned three tigers of his speaking tour of the country , he said : ‘ the message of my show would be no matter what adversity hits you in life , do n’t give up – that ’s the only time you will lose			1
‘ some can be a champion and never have a title			2
’ he even hoped that his former opponent @entity22 would hear his message after learning that the four - time champion was in financial trouble			0
‘ we all have to endure some kind of pain , ’ said ‘ @entity4 ’			0
@entity22 ’s going to be all right			0
@entity4 ’s own downward spiral began in 1990 when , after winning his first 37 professional bouts , he was knocked out by @entity65			0
this one does bite ! @entity4 bites the ear of @entity22 's during their infamous 1997 fight two years later he was jailed for rape and later he admitted to squandering some $ 300 million			0
it did n’t get any better when he was embroiled in the ear - biting scandal in the fight with @entity22			0
at the age of 39 , he retired for good in 2005 – but he admits he ’s ‘ the same guy – i just grew up a little bit ’			0
although women ’s groups and community leaders are appalled that the @entity9 government gave him a visa , he said he was now very different to his old title of ‘ the baddest man on the planet ’ .			1
