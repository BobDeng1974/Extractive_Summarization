as a member of the @entity11 royal family , @entity8 is not required to wear an abaya , the traditional voluminous black gown women in the hardline @entity7 state are forced sport in public , but still dressed demurely as a mark of respect			0
prince @entity17 and his wife were met by the governor of @entity20 , @entity21 prince @entity19 , who escorted them past an honour guard before offering them a cup of traditional cardamon coffee			0
mark of respect : the @entity1 wore a turquoise headscarf when she arrived in @entity4 with prince @entity17 dress conventions : as a member of the @entity11 royal family , @entity8 is not required to wear an abaya , the traditional voluminous black gown women in the hardline @entity7 state are forced sport in public the couple are in @entity4 on the third leg of their nine - day @entity38 tour on behalf of the @entity40			1
their presence is designed to strengthen ties between the two countries , focusing on bilateral military links and issues such as education , faith and commercial partnerships			0
yet it also comes at a time when the country ’s human rights record is , once again , being called into question following the execution on wednesday of seven prisoners convicted of armed robbery			1
welcomed : the couple have arrived in @entity4 on the third leg of their nine - day @entity38 tour refreshment : prince @entity17 tried a traditional cardamon coffee the men died at the hands of a ‘ humane ’ firing squad as the country is , according to reports , struggling to find enough executioners for traditional beheadings			1
two of the group were said to have been juveniles when they were charged with being part of a gang of thieves in the @entity4 town of @entity77			1
all were detained for more than three years , subjected to torture and denied legal representation in court			0
one of the men was also due to be crucified after his death , with his body tied to a pole in a public square to act as a deterrent to others			0
@entity91 minister for the @entity38 @entity92 , who is in the country to greet the prince , expressed his deep concern about the deaths earlier this week , saying : ‘ the death penalty is a human rights priority for the @entity11			1
feeling the heat : the @entity17 donned a hat to shade himself from the sun while his wife was draped in a headscarf			0
human rights campaigners have urged @entity105 to raise the issue of the death penalty ‘ as i have said previously , the @entity11 opposes as a matter of principle all use of the death penalty , whatever the crime committed			1
‘ we registered our concern at reports of the planned executions in this case with the @entity4 embassy …			1
. reiterating our opposition to the death penalty and requesting that leniency be shown , but to no avail			0
‘ the alleged circumstances surrounding the executions cause enormous damage to @entity4 ’s reputation internationally and we will press the @entity4 authorities once again to reconsider their application of the death penalty			2
’ @entity4 is one of five states in the world to conduct public executions and has the widest number of crimes punishable by death , including murder , rape , sodomy , robbery , theft ( after four offences ) , false prophecy and witchcraft			2
@entity145 : the @entity147 ' headscarf billows in the wind as she arrives at @entity150 according to @entity153 @entity11 at least 17 people , including eight foreign nationals , have already been executed in @entity4 this year			2
these include including @entity156 domestic worker @entity154 , who was accused of killing a baby in her care when she was just 17 but claimed to have confessed under duress			0
human rights groups have accused @entity17 of shirking his responsibilities in failing to raise the issue of the death penalty with the ruling @entity4 royal family , with whom he enjoys a close friendship			1
‘ prince @entity17 has always had the tip of his well - polished brogues in the political world and he should use his influence to tell the @entity172 a few home truths about the country ’s dreadful human rights record , ’ said @entity167 , @entity153 ’s @entity11 director			1
‘ surely , arriving in the wake of controversial executions and the jailing of human rights activists @entity17 will want to at least broach these matters ? ’ strengthening ties : the @entity17 meets governor of @entity20 prince @entity19 golden reception : @entity8 sips a coffee as she sits in the decadent hall although @entity187 have declined to comment publicly , well - placed diplomatic sources have told the @entity188 that issue may be raised in talks between @entity17 and the country ’s crown prince salman bin @entity191 tonight , albeit obliquely			1
‘ the reason why the government is keen for the prince to come here is that he enjoys a very different relationship with the @entity198 to that of the government			0
he can get things done in a way the politician frankly ca n’t , ’ they said			0
’ ‘ in my experience there is no subject off limits and it is likely that the prince will talk to him about the issue of the state of reform in the country			2
’ freedom of speech in @entity4 – or rather the lack of it - is also a matter of serious international concern , with protests banned and criticism of the state rarely tolerated			1
the couple sat in a luxurious hall in the @entity4 capital where paintings of late @entity4 kings were on the walls similarly , women have few rights in @entity4 and are required , regardless of age , to have a male guardian - typically a father or husband – who must give their permission for everything from opening a bank account to marriage			1
queen for the day : @entity8 looked happy as she sat on the gold throne they can not vote or be elected to high office and are prohibited from driving			2
indeed in 2011 a woman from @entity243 , where the royal couple will fly to on saturday , was sentenced to ten lashes by whip after being caught behind the wheel			2
women are also required to be segregated from men in public : most offices , banks and universities have separate entrances and they are required to sit separately on public transport and in restaurants			0
when it comes to dress , women are also expected to cover all parts of the body that are ‘ awrah ’ – not meant to be exposed			0
@entity4 ’s strict interpretation of @entity7 means they must cover their entire body with a black cloak known as an abaya and headcovering , or hijab , leaving just the eyes and the hands exposed			2
conventions for dress and behaviour are all fiercely enforced by the notorious religious police or mutawaeen , whose official title is the @entity278			0
for the @entity1 , women ’s rights are high on her agenda during the three - day visit			1
she plans to visit a number of establishments , including a women ’s university and a female vocation training centre , to highlight some of the steps @entity4 women are taking towards equality			1
tonight the @entity1 will also enjoy the finest hospitality the country has to offer at a lavish women - only banquet thrown in her honour by @entity21 princess @entity295 , the @entity297 ’s second - and favourite – wife of four , who acts as his official consort			2
glammed up : @entity299 changed into a gold dress to attend a women - only banquet thrown in her honour this evening by @entity21 princess @entity295 the gathering will be held at the quaintly named @entity304 , which is actually a vast estate the size of @entity307 an hour ’s drive out of @entity20 where the monarch likes to spend weekends			0
around 100 guests – including most senior woman in the @entity198 - will enjoy cultural performances such as sword dancing as they drink coffee before moving into dinner			0
according to local custom , serving staff bring tray after tray of local delicacies until the principle guests ‘ can eat no more ’			0
@entity105 will meanwhile attend a similar all - male banquet at another palace on the edge of the @entity327 wadi and its 18th century ruins			0
the country 's ruler , @entity329 , 89 , will not be present at the dinner as he is recovering from back surgery .			1

the couple are in @entity4 on the third leg of their nine - day @entity38 tour
visit comes as the country 's human rights record is , once again , being called into question
