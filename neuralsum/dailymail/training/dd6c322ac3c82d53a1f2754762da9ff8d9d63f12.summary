however , jurors at @entity10 were yesterday shown footage of @entity0 taking part in a show called @entity14 filmed in @entity7 in 1978			1
but the veteran tv star replied : ‘ i had no idea i was in @entity7 , and i do n’t think the other performers or stars did either			1
‘ i was in @entity7 but i did n’t know i was in @entity7			1
’ during the opening credits of the @entity14 final , a voiceover said the show was coming from ‘ @entity7 , a tranquil seat of learning			1
’ @entity0 was announced by host @entity36 as captain of one of the celebrity teams , which also included actors @entity40 , @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity44			2
the @entity46 could be seen ‘ jumping up and down like a kangaroo and mucking about amusingly ’ , miss @entity45 said			0
she told @entity0 : ‘ @entity36 seemed to know where he was because he introduced it as being on @entity50 , @entity7			1
’ @entity0 said : ‘ that was the first time i had heard the word @entity7			1
i do n’t think any of us knew			0
’ he told @entity45 she ‘ did n’t understand the showbiz scene ’ , saying he was often driven from place to place without knowing the location			0
the alleged victim had suggested the event had taken place in the centre of @entity7 in about 1975 when she would have been 14			1
footage shown in court today showed @entity0 taking part in the celebrity game show @entity14 on @entity66 in 1978			1
the footage was released to the media today by the prosecution to show that his claim that he first visited @entity7 four years was a lie @entity0 said in evidence he had not known where the show was filmed but was accused by barrister @entity75 of ' telling a deliberate lie ' after the jury were shown a video of him in a game show in @entity7 in 1978 , @entity0 claimed he had not realised the event had been held in the city she told the court last month that she had been working part - time to earn pocket money and was clearing up when she saw @entity0 entertaining crowds while pretending to be a dog			1
' it was quite a funny scene to behold			0
' the woman , who is now 52 , told the jury of six men and six women that @entity0 put his arm around her , and moved his hand up and down her back , before squeezing her bottom			1
with her voice wavering , she said : ' i ca n't remember the exact words but he made some motion to me ' come up ' , and i can see it in my mind 's eye as clear as if it was happening now			2
he came up and put his arm around my left shoulder			0
' it was quite a firm hold			0
i could n't believe what was going on , this famous person putting his arm around me			2
' to start it was a very nervous but a good feeling , however his hand then moved and his hand went up and down my back and his hand went over my bottom and it was very firm			0
' the woman said : ' i was too young to really understand the term but it was basically like groping			0
it was very firm and he squeezed it a few times			0
' i was just completely frozen			0
i knew it was wrong			0
' she said she was ' extremely embarrassed ' and moved away as soon as @entity0 let go of her			2
the woman said she contacted the police after the revelations about @entity129 in october 2012 and when it was publicly revealed that @entity0 had been arrested , because she wanted to back up any other alleged victims			2
miss @entity45 told @entity0 , who denies the assault : ‘ the footage shows you monkeying around pretending to be an animal – all of which fits the description [ the alleged victim ] said she saw prior to being assaulted by you			2
‘ you have said categorically in this case that all the people who say they had been sexually assaulted by you have lied			0
i ’m going to suggest it is you who is lying and that video demonstrates it			2
' there is no way you could have forgotten that event and you deliberately tried to mislead the jury when you told them you had not visited @entity7 until four years ago			1
that was a deliberate lie			0
‘ the film footage ... demonstrated it ’s not the victims who have lied , it ’s you who lied			0

he had claimed he was n't there and first visited the city only four years ago
