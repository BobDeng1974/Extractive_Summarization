by @entity0 published : 17:33 est , 3 january 2014 updated : 19:02 est , 3 january 2014 @entity2 president @entity1 has questioned in public whether a joyless @entity4 camp has remained too intense through this @entity6 debacle			1
@entity7 , an @entity6 - winning captain in @entity9 , made his comments while on a corporate breakfast function panel at the @entity12 before the start of the fifth test			1
@entity7 claimed @entity9 coach @entity15 has the work - play balance right , with a joke of the day and a beer on the bus rather than @entity4 ’s endless video analysis of their errors			1
lighten up : @entity2 president @entity1 wonders whether @entity4 have been too intense @entity22 and @entity7 added that he felt senior players , as well as not scoring enough runs , had not given enough direction to the rest of the squad			1
@entity4 ’s beleaguered team director @entity28 defended his approach after a fourth defeat in a row at @entity32 saying , if anything , a new intensity was necessary for @entity12			2
@entity35 , still @entity4 ’s marquee batsman , has @entity9 bat company @entity36 chasing his signature			1
they are aware that @entity35 ’s adidas contract expires in 2014 and will be first in the queue if it is not renewed			2
@entity35 has been a major adidas client since they moved into cricket in 2008			2
but adidas will need to be convinced he intends playing on for a number of years before committing to another big contract			0
@entity36 , who pay around £ 250,000 a year for @entity50 ’s endorsement , are likely to meet @entity35 ’s asking price if adidas do n’t			2
meanwhile , @entity53 , a century - maker for @entity9 on friday , is said to be switching from @entity55 to a @entity36 bat			1
hairy moment : @entity9 bat company @entity36 want @entity35 's signature the emergence of @entity60 is the only positive that @entity4 can take out of this dismal tour and the all - rounder looks to have some much - needed character as well			1
asked after his six - wicket haul whether he was up for the ‘ fray ’ , @entity60 replied : ‘ what does that mean ? do n’t use those big words on me			0
’ the @entity9 media have ended the ashes as they began in @entity71 with another puerile newspaper offensive			2
the @entity73 has a giant billboard truck displaying the ‘ sneering snouts ’ of the @entity4 team , which they intend to whitewash to cover ‘ their unsightly faces full of colonial smirk ’			0
a star is born : @entity4 's @entity60 holds the match ball after taking six wickets on day one in @entity12 @entity82 gets on his bike @entity82 , who has been keen on motor sport since growing up near @entity85 , may make his media debut commentating on motorbikes if he does join @entity88			1
their rights include the next five years of @entity91			0
on the cricket front , @entity88 will be bidding for the @entity93 along with the @entity95 ’s @entity94 and 50 - over @entity96			0
@entity82 is due to receive just 30 days ’ notice money from his central contract after quitting with two @entity100 to go @entity22			0
@entity101 , who was eased out of the team following the @entity104 victory three years ago , was paid the full nine months left on his @entity106 contract			0
where 's the mic ? @entity82 may commentate on motorbike racing if he joins @entity88 there is mystery as to why former @entity9 captain @entity113 ’s induction into the @entity114 this week was such a low - key affair			1
the ceremony , despite @entity116 starting in cricket right by the @entity12 , was a little - publicised reception there on the eve of the @entity104 — previous inductees @entity123 and @entity124 were feted on the pitch during a @entity100			0
certainly , @entity116 is not the most popular of former @entity9 greats			0
@entity127 said arrangements were made by the @entity95 , whose spokesman added that one of their @entity134 events every year is always a function			0
hall of famer : the induction into the @entity114 of @entity113 was a low - key affair the @entity2 hierarchy , out in force in @entity9 , should take time to examine the facilities at @entity12 , which make @entity144 ’s look second - rate in comparison			1
the media ’s working conditions at cricket ’s headquarters lag behind almost all international grounds in @entity9 and those in @entity152 , @entity153 and even @entity154			2
a lot about @entity124 has changed since the last @entity6 tour @entity22 , including his brilliant white teeth and his preferred insult for @entity159			1
it used to be ‘ you ’re a muppet ’ but has now been upgraded to ‘ you ’re a k * * * - jockey ’			0
no holding back : @entity124 ( right ) has a new insult for @entity159			0

@entity2 president @entity1 questions whether @entity4 have been too intense in @entity9
@entity9 bat company @entity36 are chasing @entity35 's signature
@entity60 is the only positive for @entity4 from this dismal @entity6 tour
@entity82 could make his media debut commentating on motorbikes
