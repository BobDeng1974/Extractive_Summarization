when travelling in @entity1 , you should invest in a turban , available with a little haggling at any bazaar			1
you might expect the locals to resent your attempts to dress up as a minor character in a @entity9 or @entity10 film			1
on the contrary , they appreciate any efforts by @entity13 to come to terms with their complex culture and exhaustingly hectic society			1
' you look great , sir , magnificent , ' said a tuk - tuk driver , stopping in heavy traffic in @entity20 , causing an embarrassing fanfare of car horns			1
' you look like maharaja			2
' a landscape of colour and charm : the @entity28 memorial ( foreground ) stands proudly in @entity30 next morning , when our guide for the day turned up , he had heard there was a maharaja in town			2
when i was greeted by shopkeepers , shouting ' where is your turban , sir ? you must wear it , ' he realised the fake maharaja was only me			2
wherever you go in @entity1 , strangers engage you in conversation , usually trying to sell you clothing , food or hotel rooms , or asking ' where you from ? ' wear a turban to cut out this tiresome preliminary banter			1
our guide happened to be a local disc jockey and , by the time we set off the next evening for a camel trek and camping by a fire in the sand dunes , the presence of the fake maharaja had even reached the camel drivers			2
radio is a powerful medium in the desert by the @entity68 border , they told us			2
how to wear a turban , parts one and two : left , a camel driver in @entity72 ; right : @entity73 as a ' maharaja ' we spent two weeks driving in and around @entity72 , starting and finishing in @entity75 , staying one or two nights in each place			1
the province is the size of @entity81 , but the roads are not as good , so it 's a punishing schedule , with gridlock traffic in the cities and huge potholes taking you by surprise			1
a driver is an essential requirement for anyone unaccustomed to @entity93 roads			2
ours was able to negotiate heavy trucks , cyclists , unaccompanied cows , dogs , sheep and goats , and rickshaws , sometimes at speed through narrow gaps with inches to spare			2
a place for reflection : @entity107 rises magnificently on the shores of @entity109 in @entity72 what do you do if you find your side of the motorway is blocked by roadworks ? drive on the opposite carriageway against the oncoming traffic , then cross the central reservation when you get a chance			1
others may blast their horns , but this is standard procedure			2
animals and men , young and old , even sleep unmolested in the central reservations , while fathers often pile their families on the backs of their scooters , sometimes with five passengers , including small children and ladies in flowing saris , riding sidesaddle without helmets			2
we never saw any of them come to any harm , although there were some agonising near - misses			1
it is 41 years since i last visited @entity75 , but since that time , everyone has acquired a car			1
thank goodness for the @entity144 , which caused them to invest in a @entity146 system			0
we spent two days in @entity75 , visiting the @entity147 , @entity148 , @entity149 , @entity150 , @entity151 and @entity153 's monumental government buildings			1
then @entity154 , the @entity155 , where ladies like to sit sadly perched in princess @entity158 's famous seat , and @entity159			1
then @entity160 , @entity161 and @entity107			0
@entity160 is famous for its harem where the ruler 's ladies can look out on the street from windows without being seen themselves , as well as a tribe of elephants taking tourists up the hill to the @entity171			0
@entity107 has a lake with a palace in the middle and another on the shore			0
this is popular as a wedding venue and for spectacular firework displays			0
all in the balance : local women display their astonishing carrying skills in the desert outside @entity20 from there , we travelled to @entity185 , a noted bird sanctuary with dam and an artificial lake			0
guests stay in luxurious tents and the manager takes you on a tour of the local village , explaining the @entity196 's the prince of @entity160 in painted the colour giving it ' the @entity200 ' environmentallyfriendly structure of the community , its schools , farm workers , potters and silversmiths			0
life sometimes stands on its head in @entity1			1
at @entity208 , we saw a temple where rats in their thousands are fed , pampered and generally worshipped			0
in @entity30 , we stayed in the now famous @entity213 hotel , with its magnificent view of the @entity215 perched on top of a steep cliff			0
by this stage , you 'll need to keep a note of your forts , to avoid getting them muddled			0
the @entity213 is a quiet enclave in the centre of the city , but with a mosque at the end of the garden			0
the hotel thoughtfully provides earplugs to prevent guests being woken up by the call to prayer at 4am			0
we had dinner in another new establishment , the @entity236 , on the evening the @entity237 of @entity30 was paying his first official visit			0
in the pink : local men watch the world go by on a warm afternoon in the @entity72 city of @entity20 this is one of those hotels where massive , three - day @entity246 - type weddings take place - a thriving business and expensive for prosperous families			1
the @entity237 and @entity249 were greeted by the manager and by the head chef , who happens to be his highness 's nephew			0
@entity255 petals were sprinkled at the @entity237 's feet and a four - course dinner served			1
good to see that nothing has changed			0
no one sprinkled rose petals at my feet , however			0
i was n't wearing my turban			0
@entity263 ( 0207 873 5000 , www.coxandkings.co.uk ) has a 15 - day / 13 - night escorted @entity264 of @entity1 priced from Â£ 2,295 per person including flights , transfers , excursions and accommodation with breakfast daily .			1

@entity1 is fertile *territory* for those seeking the country at its finest
the cities of @entity75 and @entity154 are awash with *landmarks* , like the @entity155
the north - *easterly* state of @entity72 is a *paradise* for *intrepid* travellers
