by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 last updated at 8:17 am on 1st february 2012 accused : @entity3 , drinking with friends in his home town in @entity8 , was found dead in his prison cell a @entity11 charged with battering a retired couple to death in their home was a violent criminal who had already been kicked out of the @entity17			1
@entity3 , 37 , who was awaiting trial for murdering @entity20 and @entity21 with a lump hammer , was found hanged in his prison cell on saturday			1
he had twice made his way into the @entity17 illegally , on the second occasion without a passport			1
today it can be revealed that the convicted armed robber : the @entity17 authorities had no idea @entity32 was even in the country until they arrested him two weeks ago			1
the jobbing builder targeted @entity35 and mrs @entity36 , 62 and 58 , after he was employed to do some work on the patio at their home in the @entity41 area of @entity42			1
the couple , who were married for 40 years , were found on january 11 by their son @entity45 , 37 , a police officer			1
@entity32 was arrested five days later and charged with murder			2
he was found dead in his cell at top security woodhill jail , @entity50 , on saturday before he could offer an explanation for what happened			2
murder victims : @entity21 and his wife @entity54 who were bludgeoned to death with a hammer tenants in the seedy @entity42 bedsit where he had been living said @entity32 was ‘ a madman ’ who kept a collection of hammers in his room			1
though he said he was a builder , they suspected him of being a burglar ‘ or something worse ’			2
in fact , @entity32 was a career criminal whose string of convictions spanned a ten - year period			1
@entity54 and @entity21 's latest grandchild @entity73 the father of two came from the village of @entity76 , around 150 miles from the @entity11 capital , @entity78			1
his ex-wife , @entity79 , said the muscular robber had never had a job and had been involved in crime since he left school			0
‘ he came from a good family , but he did nothing , ’ she said			0
‘ he was a thief , a burglar , a robber			0
he would steal anything – wood , petrol , property from people ’s homes			0
‘ he drank a lot of alcohol			0
almost everyone in the countryside drinks a lot			0
there ’s nothing else to do			0
‘ we were married for 11 years but he was not home very much			1
he used to go out drinking all the time with his friends and they would plot their next crime			2
‘ he would come out of jail , be free for a few months , and then be sent back again			2
’ she has brought up their son and daughter , now 12 and 17 , alone			0
‘ i ’m ashamed of him and so are the children , ’ she said			0
@entity79 divorced @entity32 in 1999 , during his first stint in prison for burglary			2
by 2003 , he was back on the prowl and convicted for an armed robbery in the @entity117			2
he returned to his home country in 2005 to serve the rest of his lengthy sentence			1
violent crime : @entity3 , pictured in a court sketch , was discovered dead in his cell just 12 days after he had been charged with the brutal murder of @entity21 and @entity36 , who were bludgeoned to death with a hammer four years later , he was granted parole – and immediately went on the run			1
when the authorities finally found him , he had been living in @entity17 undetected for almost a year			1
he had somehow made his way into this country despite being on a ‘ watch ’ list			2
@entity32 was extradited back to @entity8 in 2009			1
once home , he was sentenced to a further one year and eight months for absconding and breaking the terms of his release			2
by 2011 , he was in trouble again , this time for leaving the scene of an accident and drunk driving while disqualified			2
but , incredibly , he was soon back in the @entity17			1
jail : @entity32 was found hanged in his cell at @entity3 , near @entity50 , @entity143 , just 12 days after he was charged with the murder of @entity35 and mrs @entity36 with no right to benefits , he eked out a meagre existence in the run - down @entity149 area of @entity42			1
housemates said he was violent , heavy drinking , and would steal anything lying around			0
@entity154 said he threatened to kill him if he came into his room uninvited			0
investigation : a forensic tent sits outside the home in @entity41 , @entity42 where bodies of @entity35 and mrs @entity36 were discovered dirty work : police teams looking for clues search drains near the house in the days after the discovery ‘ he was like a madman , ’ mr @entity154 , 28 , an unemployed chef , said			0
‘ he pushed me very hard up against the wall and made a fist like he was going to punch me			0
‘ there was so much anger in his face			0
he was obviously a bad guy , a violent guy			0
’ a month before the @entity174 were murdered , @entity32 began doing some building work on their patio as part of a gang of @entity180			2
a family friend said : ‘ it ’s terrible to think he decided to attack them after he had been inside their house and worked for them			0
’ three weeks before the murder , @entity32 left his £ 40 - a - week room without paying his rent			1
‘ he seemed very nervous before he left , ’ mr @entity154 said			0
‘ he did n’t say goodbye – one day he was just not there			0
’ mr @entity154 said that although the tattooed @entity11 was ‘ not that tall ’ he was very strong			1
‘ he had massive hands and his arm muscles were like iron , ’ mr @entity154 said			0
among the sea of floral tributes outside the @entity174 ’ semi-detached home yesterday was a photo of their youngest grandchild			0
@entity73 was born to their son , @entity21 , and his wife @entity204 , both 32 , a week before they were killed			1
the text read : ‘ nanny and @entity206			0
i love and miss you both			0
love always and for ever , your newborn grandson xxxx			0
’ by @entity210 if a monster like @entity3 was free to enter @entity17 , just what does a foreign criminal have to do to be turned away ? inevitably , the issue is complicated by the free movement directives and edicts issued by @entity217 which have eroded our border controls			1
in most instances , @entity17 must throw its doors wide open to the citizen of a fellow @entity224 country , even convicted criminals			1
but the rules do allow the @entity17 to turn away the worst offenders			1
@entity229 , as a convicted armed robber , fell into such a category			0
the problem in his case is that we had no idea he was travelling to the @entity17			1
@entity8 , with other @entity224 member states , has given an undertaking to warn us if a danger man may be heading our way so that he can be stopped from going through passport controls			1
but the system breaks down entirely when , as in the @entity32 case , the home country of the offender does not keep its side of the bargain			2
chillingly , @entity229 is only the latest in a long line of eastern @entity249 to slip through the net			1
earlier this month , a senior judge demanded to know why another @entity11 , child - rapist @entity252 , was let into @entity17 , where he went on to rape a woman			1
the @entity254 understands that , in this case , @entity8 again failed to inform the @entity256 of his history or possible intention to travel			1
last friday , it emerged that a sexual predator from the @entity117 who had murdered his wife was able to travel to the @entity17 where he carried out a knifepoint rape and three serious sex attacks			1
ministers have made one specific change to the rules which could prevent an exact repeat of the @entity32 case			0
now , whenever a person is extradited from @entity17 that information is passed to @entity271 ( @entity272 ) which assesses the case			2
if it shows a public protection risk @entity271 asks the @entity276 to place a marker on its watchlist			0
but unless a person has been previously extradited , we remain utterly reliant on other @entity224 member states fulfilling their obligations to warn us of any convict intending to travel			0
ultimately , they know that they have countless free movement directives on their side			0
cynically , they may even take the view that they would rather have their murderers and rapists living in @entity294 is most worrying is that it is impossible to know how many men like @entity229 are already here			0
and if we did not count them in , how are we to get them out ? heartbreak : @entity299 and her brother @entity21 break down in tears as they speak about their love for their murdered parents tearful : ms @entity299 told the press conference that after her family learned of the killing ' the light was switched out in our lives and our hearts have been broken forever '			2
