he no longer needs it now he has lost so much weight mr @entity6 ( pictured before his weight loss surgery ) had such bad sleep apnoea that he stopped breathing up to 80 times a night and he feared he would die in his sleep it is associated with being overweight and some patients have to wear a mask at night to prevent their throat closing			1
mr @entity6 finally sought help from his gp in 2011 after a life long battle with his weight			1

mr @entity6 has revolutionised his diet and his sleep apnoea has disappeared			1

’ by the time he left school , he was more than 17 stone and continued to grow after getting married and starting a family			0
he explained : ‘ with each baby that came along my wife and i both put on weight			0
we were eating a typical @entity84 diet with lots of fat as well as take outs , sweets and junk			0
’ before : breakfast : full fry upbreakfast two : pastry , biscuits and @entity94 : crisps , chocolate , fizzy @entity97 : kebab or chicken and chips , fizzy @entity102 : @entity104 : coffee and more @entity106 after work : cup of tea and @entity109 : chicken curry and rice - two @entity110 : ice cream with flake and syrup now : breakfast : @entity116 , @entity117 or @entity118 : yoghurt or apple and bottle of @entity122 : chicken or fish with salad or @entity126 : yoghurt blended with @entity128 : either fish or chicken with @entity131 : bottle of water by his mid-twenties mr @entity6 weighed 30 stone and had to wear specially ordered @entity137 clothing			1

he said : ‘ it did n’t make sense because i was going to bed at the same time but woke feeling like i ’d stepped out of the boxing ring			0
’ then his wife @entity148 , 30 , noticed he was waking with a start throughout the night			0
it got worse and he started leaping out of bed gasping for breath before falling asleep and doing the same again			0
tests confirmed he was suffering with sleep apnoea			1
it had been triggered by his weight and was caused by fatty tissue at the back of the neck blocking his airway as he lay down to sleep			2
the only solution was to sleep with a mask on that regulated his breathing			2

to be told my breathing was stopping at night because i was so fat was terrifying			2
i was scared to sleep in case i never woke up ' mr @entity6 said : ' i could n't walk without getting out of breath			1
playing with the children left me exhausted and i knew i had to do something but did n't know where to start ' within the first five months he lost nine stone , curing his sleep apnoea and meaning he could stop wearing the mask			1
he said : ‘ it was a great feeling to go to bed without it			0
