by @entity0 published : 19:41 est , 26 february 2014 @entity2 : 06:00 est , 27 february 2014 severely brain - damaged patients have been brought ' back to life ' by zapping their brain with an electrical current severely brain damaged patients have been brought briefly ‘ back to life ’ by zapping their brain with an electrical current			1
awoken from their near - coma state , some were able to move their hands or follow instructions – others were able to answer simple questions			1
the remarkable discovery could lead to new treatments for people left minimally conscious by car accidents or blows to the head			1
it also raises the possibility that such patients will be able to tell doctors whether they want to live or die			1
they could also be asked whether they feel pain			0
researcher @entity28 , a coma scientist , said : ‘ in some cases , members of your family can be left with difficult decisions about whether to remove life support			0
‘ and we ca n’t make any decisions ethically if we ’re not sure about the diagnosis , prognosis and therapeutic options			0
’ dr @entity28 , of the @entity40 in @entity41 , treated 55 people with severe brain injuries			1
some were in a vegetative state , which meant they appeared awake but were unresponsive to the world around them			0
others were in a minimally conscious state , in which patients show fleeting signs of alertness but recovery is not guaranteed			2
some had been in the near coma - like conditions for years			0
however , almost a third temporarily showed signs of consciousness after their brains were stimulated with a mild electric current for 20 minutes			2
dr @entity28 told @entity62 magazine : ‘ two patients emerged from a minimally conscious state all together			2
’ when asked questions such as ‘ am i touching my nose ? ’ , they were able to answer by nodding their head or making specific eye movements			1
others were able to follow instructions to nod or squeeze their hand			0
researchers at the @entity40 in @entity41 studied the effect electrical currents had on 55 brain - injury patients all of the effects wore off after about two hours but dr @entity28 is now investigating the effect of stimulating the brain for longer			1
it is not entirely clear how the current helps but it may boost brain activity that underlies conscious tasks but has been suppressed			1
@entity85 , a professor of medical ethics in the @entity87 , said : ‘ it is like we are opening and shutting a window for a few hours and that could be perceived as cruel			0
‘ but we did n’t give these people brain damage , we are trying to make it better			2
‘ these kind of experiments show that a window exists and now you that that you might be able to use other interventions to enhance that window			0
’ @entity62 says : ‘ this discovery has clear medical benefits : it should help doctors make better assessments of patients ’ conditions			1
‘ the hope is that researchers will be able to extend the stimulation , resulting in more significant brain activity and even , perhaps , a return to something resembling an acceptable quality of life			2
‘ before then , there is a host of ethical issues			0
‘ no one has yet asked the obvious ethical questions : are you suffering ? do you want to live , or die ? '			0

some patients treated by electrical current were able to move their hands , others could answer simple questions
remarkable discovery could lead to new treatments for car crash *victims*
