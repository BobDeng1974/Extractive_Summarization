by @entity0 follow @ @ samcunningham @entity2 chief executive @entity1 has warned that the growing parachute payments for clubs relegated from the @entity5 are in danger of decreasing the competitiveness of the championship			1
@entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 will receive around £ 60million over the next four years after dropping out of the top - flight last season			1
that figure has increased from the previous £ 48m parachute payments			1
but @entity1 ( right ) , whose @entity2 side are fighting to gain promotion from the @entity8 having reached the play - offs in the past two seasons , is concerned that it could prevent the competition being a level playing field			2
firing shot : @entity2 chief executive @entity1 has warned about the impact of parachute payments ‘ despite the highest average crowd in the @entity5 over the past two season , some of the best long - term sponsorship deals and sold - out hospitality , that does n’t add up to one season ’s parachute payments , ’ said @entity1			2
‘ for me the disparity is too large and it will have an impact — if we ’re not careful — on the competitiveness of the division			0
‘ people could argue that those with parachutes are not always promoted so it ca n’t be having an effect			0
that ’s true , but payments have n’t been this large before and the disparity not this great			0
‘ we have to be careful fans do n’t lose heart and feel they ’ve got a mountain to climb before a ball is kicked			0
’ doing it right : @entity54 want to win promotion to the @entity5 under @entity57 's management			1

@entity57 is in charge at the @entity60
@entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 receive around £ 60million over next four years
