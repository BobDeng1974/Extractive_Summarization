‘ all the many , many other people who supported me , encouraged me and taught me so much			2
‘ and i hope that in return i encouraged them and that i did n’t give offence because i tried to speak my mind and that ’s what you ’ve got to do in politics			1
so thank you very much			2
’ laughing he added : ‘ and i ’ll check that on transmission ’			2

labour leader @entity52 praised mr @entity3 as an ‘ iconic figure of our age ’			1
a critic of @entity46 , mr @entity3 supported the leadership of mr @entity52			1
in fact , he was a regular visitor to mr @entity52 ’s childhood home in @entity60 , @entity61 , because he was friendly with his @entity63 academic father @entity62 and political activist mother @entity62			2
in 1986 , when @entity52 was 16 , he spent his summer holiday working as an intern in mr @entity3 ’s basement study at his home in @entity69			1
mr @entity3 wrote of his young charge : ‘ very helpful			1
he has just taken his o - levels and is at a loose end			2
’ thanks : mr @entity3 delivered the message at his family			1
he is pictured here in the 1950s with his wife @entity11 and ( left to right ) children @entity78 , @entity80 , @entity81 and @entity82 he remained friendly with the @entity83 over the years – although @entity52 and @entity84 had moved away from his ideas politically			2
in december 2000 , @entity3 wrote in his diaries about ‘ the boys ’ living ‘ entirely in the world of the prime minister ’s advisers ’			1
@entity52 said yesterday : ‘ whether you agreed with him or disagreed with him , everyone knew where he stood and what he stood for			2
’ there were less kindly words from former foe @entity97 , who beat mr @entity3 by a tiny margin for the deputy @entity46 leadership in 1981			1
former chancellor @entity97 , 96 , told @entity102 : ‘ he was in my view an artificial @entity104			2
he was trying to prove he was working class , he was very ashamed of his upper class background			0
’ he added : ‘ there was quite a lot of bitterness because i felt he did the party enormous damage at that time , by the way he behaved , not just his views			0
he was extremely rude and offensive in what he said			0
’ close friends : @entity118 leader @entity117 ( left ) , who also died this week , is pictured here alongside @entity3			1

’ @entity132 called him a ‘ powerful , fearless , relentless advocate for social justice and people ’s rights ’			0
and @entity137 said : ‘ even when i disagreed with him , i always had enormous respect for his brilliance , his passion and his commitment to the people of @entity144			0

mr @entity3 was taken ill several weeks ago			1
in a statement his four children said he died at his home in @entity69 , @entity152 , surrounded by his family			1
the statement added : ‘ we are comforted by the memory of his long , full and inspiring life and so proud of his devotion to helping others as he sought to change the world for the better			0
’ his eldest son @entity82 must now decide whether he wants to formally become the 3rd @entity161 , the title his father renounced			0
to do so he must apply to the @entity164 to be put on the @entity165			0
however , he would have to wait for a vacancy in the @entity167 caused by the death of one of the four remaining @entity46 hereditary peers			1
a ‘ by - election ’ to elect a successor involves a vote by the remaining three			0
by @entity174 he buried the ashes of his beloved wife @entity11 under the trees in the front garden of the family home in @entity180 , marked with a bust of her head and a marble headstone inscribed with the words ‘ author , teacher and socialist ’			2
beneath the words , a space was left where his own name will now be inscribed			0
behind @entity3 ’s implacable left - wing beliefs , there was a deeply emotional family man of great tenderness and tearful sentimentality			1
devoted : @entity3 with @entity11 in 1979			1
he proposed to her on this bench in 1949 for example , he always sobbed at the final scene in the film @entity199 – the moment when the engine ’s steam clears to reveal the father coming home from prison and the children running towards him			0
@entity3 even persuaded @entity207 to sell him the wooden bench on which @entity11 was sitting when he proposed to her in 1949 , just nine days after they had met			1
he placed the seat , too , by her headstone , and would spend hours sitting there , wondering where she was and when he would join her			0
they had been married for 51 years and he never got over her death			2
‘ she was the greatest inspiration of my life , ’ he said			0
‘ i think of her many times each day			0
’ ‘ @entity221 and friendship are the secret of happiness , ’ he wrote			0
‘ when i got married , my dad ’s advice was to keep a big balance of affection in the bank , because you ’re going to need it			0
’ long - serving : @entity3 and @entity232 campaigning in @entity233 - november 1950 further back , in his childhood , he had sat on his grandmother ’s bed when she was very ill and remembered her telling him : ‘ the great thing about your last journey is that you do n’t have to pack			1
’ he recalled @entity11 ’s view of death , too , as ‘ a great adventure ’			0
her courage had a great influence on his own thinking about death , saying : ‘ i ’m not afraid of it – but i do n’t want to go just yet			0
’ @entity11 was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1996 and died in november 2000 , and the bleak emptiness @entity3 felt as a widower never left him			1
once or twice , he admitted , his thoughts strayed to @entity252 , the @entity254 - based euthanasia centre			0
what kept him going , though , was his four children and nine grandchildren , who he described as ‘ an inspiration ’			0
he once said : ‘ my idea of a perfect day is to see all four of my children			0
’ they are @entity82 , the eldest , who works for the @entity262 ; @entity81 , who has written novels ; @entity80 , who works for the homeless charity crisis ; and @entity78 , @entity46 mp for @entity266 and a member of the @entity268			1
political force : @entity3 and his wife campaigning in the 1984 @entity271 by - election @entity3 was thrilled when @entity78 got a job in the @entity137 government as international development minister			2
seeing how lost he was without @entity11 , his children and their children did their best to cheer him up			0
there was the occasion when @entity81 ’s daughter , @entity280 , recounted to her grandfather how he had taken her when she was much younger to watch a @entity283 film			0
during a scene in which @entity283 opens a photo album and looks at his parents and himself as a small child , @entity3 had burst into tears			2
on the way home , @entity280 told him : ‘ when you die , @entity292 , you will be in my heart , and now there is a piece of you in my heart already			0
’ there was never a day , either , when @entity11 was not in @entity3 ’s heart and his thoughts			2
now , they are together again .			0
