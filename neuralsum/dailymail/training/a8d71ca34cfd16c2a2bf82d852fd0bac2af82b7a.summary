by @entity0 published : 08:28 est , 7 may 2012 updated : 09:05 est , 7 may 2012 the app - dubbed a ' friendly stalking ' application - locates nearby @entity3 users with similar interests to be your ' friends ' , located via their phones @entity3 has made its second major acquisition this year after buying social location application @entity12			1
the app - dubbed a ' friendly stalking ' application - locates nearby @entity3 ( and , as of now , @entity5 ) users with similar interests to be your ' friends ' , located via their phones			1
along with its purchase of @entity18 for $ 1 billion , it 's an indication that @entity3 is keen to beef up its expertise in mobile technology - both apps are focused on phones and tablets , rather than desktop pcs. for an undisclosed sum @entity3 , took ownership of all of @entity28 ’s technology and its staff in its latest attempt to crack location based services			1
@entity12 quietly tracks users ’ locations and suggests people nearby who have similar interests by comparing their profiles on @entity5 and @entity3			1
it is different from @entity38 because users do not have to check in and works in the background until it finds a good match nearby			2
users can then ask to become ‘ favourites ’ with people they would like to know , a process that has been dubbed ‘ friendly stalking ’			2
@entity12 generated a significant amount of buzz at the @entity50 this year and appears to have impresed @entity3 more than @entity51 , a similar location sharing app. the difference with @entity51 is that it shows the exact location of other users on a map , whereas @entity12 just tells you they are nearby			0
experts said that the sale was not another @entity18 which had 35million users and was a potential threat to @entity3			2
@entity63 only has been downloaded 30,000 times and 20,000 users using it in the background on their @entity68			0
unlike rivals , the app does n't tell you the actual location of potential ' friends ' - just that they are nearby the app is not on the scale of @entity18 - it only has a few thousand users - but it 's an indication that @entity3 is serious about mobile apps it comes after @entity3 bought photo sharing app @entity18 for $ 1billion and shows how serious it is about beefing up its mobile site but @entity3 is keen to make it a success after its similar ‘ places ’ app failed @entity86 also bought @entity87 , which again carried out a similar function - but shut it down months later			1
@entity3 ’s move was greeted with some scepticism on some technology websites and writing on @entity93 said it was bad for @entity12 users			0
she said : ‘ unfortunately for the app ’s users , this was a talent grab			0
‘ it looks like @entity3 is shutting @entity12 down ; users are being offered the chance to download their data , and the app has been yanked from the @entity104 and @entity106 ’s @entity105 ’			0
in a statement @entity3 said it was ‘ thrilled ’ to acquire @entity12 .			0

second big buy in advance of like may 18 stock *market* *flotation*
