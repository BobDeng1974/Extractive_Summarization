by @entity0 if the last four opening @entity2 games are anything to by then we are in for a treat tonight when @entity6 kick things off against @entity8 in @entity9			1
@entity11 ’s side are hot favourites to win the trophy on home soil and will be desperate to start with a bang against their @entity16 opponents			0
@entity18 has taken an enjoyable trip down memory lane to look at the explosive starts to the 1998 , 2002 , 2006 and 2010 @entity22			2
1998 : june 10 , @entity23 , @entity24 @entity6 2 - 1 @entity25 picture the scene – @entity29 in glorious sunshine , a new stadium packed with 80,000 fans , the reigning world champions			1
a backline of @entity33 , @entity34 and the two @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity37 , were handed the unenviable task of keeping @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41 quiet			0
and for more than 300 seconds they did , before centre - back @entity42 nodded a @entity40 corner past @entity47 goalkeeper @entity46			0
colourful setting : @entity23 hosted the the opening ceremony of the 1998 @entity23 @entity2 the goal stirred @entity52 ’s side into life , and rather than a resounding @entity6 win like many predicted , the @entity56 were able to force their @entity59 opponents back			1
seven minutes before half - time they were level , through @entity63 , who swept a penalty beyond the dive of @entity66 after a @entity68 foul on @entity69			0
all square : @entity63 ( centre ) drew @entity25 level in their @entity74 opener against @entity6 via a penalty @entity25 repelled wave after wave of @entity6 attacks in the second half before disaster struck in the 78th minute			2
a hopeful chipped pass towards the overlapping @entity83 was flicked at goal , and @entity46 could only push the ball into the chest of the recovering @entity33			0
with @entity46 out of position time appeared to stop as the ball slowly bounced off @entity33 and into the bottom corner , to hand @entity6 a 2 - 1 win			1
heartbreaker : @entity25 defender @entity33 ( centre ) scored a late own goal to give @entity6 a 2 - 1 win 2002 : may 31 , @entity95 , @entity96 @entity23 0 - 1 @entity97 even without @entity98 , who was ruled out of the opening match through injury , @entity23 were expected to roll over a @entity97 side making their first appearance at a @entity2			1
@entity104 and @entity105 , who had just finished a season in @entity107 with @entity108 at the time , had other ideas			0
they , along with their nine tireless team - mates , produced one of the biggest upsets in @entity2 history to stun the defending champions and captivate a global audience , very few of whom would have given them a chance before kick - off			0
huge shock : papa @entity105 ( right ) scored the only goal in @entity97 's @entity2 win against @entity23 in 2002 in midfield , @entity105 dominated @entity123 , of @entity125 origin , and @entity126			1
the @entity97 star , nicknamed ‘ @entity130 ’ on account of his considerable frame , scored the only goal of the game in the 30th minute , scooping the ball home following fine play from @entity104 , who terrorised the @entity136 defence throughout			2
@entity23 ’s coach @entity137 threw on @entity138 and @entity139 in an attempt to turn the tide , but as the reigning champions pushed on @entity97 looked the more likely to score , and @entity143 glancing a header off the crossbar late on			2
threat : @entity104 ( right ) proved a constant menace to then @entity2 holder @entity23 in their 1 - 0 victory 2006 : june 9 , @entity151 , @entity152 @entity154 4 - 2 @entity153 @entity156 fans will have enjoyed seeing former @entity159 favourite @entity158 strike twice against the hosts in @entity152 on the opening day of the 2006 @entity2 , although his brace was not enough to stop @entity154 marching to the top of @entity164 the @entity151 was the stage for some fabulous long - range strikes , as @entity168 ’s side started their campaign with a 4 - 2 win			1
@entity171 got things started in the sixth minute , cutting in from his station on the left and curling an unstoppable shot into the top right corner			0
thunderbolt : @entity154 's @entity171 ( left ) scored the 2006 @entity2 opening goal vs @entity153 but six minutes later @entity153 were level , @entity158 sweeping the ball past @entity180 for his first of the afternoon			1
before the mid-point of the first half @entity154 were back in front , when @entity184 poked home @entity186 ’s off - target effort			2
for 44 minutes , quite amazingly considering the thunderous opening to the match , there were no goals , until @entity184 added his second from close range after his initial header was saved by @entity195			0
party pooper : striker @entity158 ( centre ) scored twice for @entity153 against hosts @entity154 in 2006 not long after @entity158 reminded @entity200 fans of his pedigree , clipping the ball over @entity180 to draw the hosts back to 3 - 2 and set up an anxious finale			1
the scraggly - haired midfielder , who had threatened from long - range throughout the game , lashed the ball into the top corner from 35 yards to settle @entity212 nerves and ensure the hosts started the @entity2 with a win			2
predator : @entity184 scored @entity154 's second and third goals in their 4 - 2 win vs @entity153 in @entity152 2010 : june 11 , @entity217 , @entity218 @entity220 1 - 1 @entity219 as the @entity220 team emerged on to the pitch at @entity217 after dancing their way down the tunnel they were given a thunderous reception from their vibrant fans in the stands			1
and despite a fairly low - key first half , which saw @entity219 go close through @entity232 and have a @entity234 goal chalked off when he was quite clearly onside , the game burst to life in the 55th minute courtesy of @entity239 ’s left foot			1
goal : @entity239 ( centre ) levelled for @entity220 's in their 1 - 1 draw vs @entity219 in the 2010 @entity2 @entity245 favourite @entity244 was the architect , scything the @entity219 defence open with a perfect pass into the left - hand channel			1
@entity249 hooked the ball into his stride , powered past @entity252 and then unleashed a rocket into the far corner hit with such venom it left @entity257 in the @entity219 goal helpless			0
@entity259 tried to replicate @entity249 ’s strike up the other end , but somehow @entity262 deflected his effort over			0
@entity219 ’s pressure eventually paid off when @entity265 showed great composure to control the ball and curl a shot past @entity262 in the penalty area , though @entity270 nearly restored @entity220 ’s lead when he struck the base of the post late on			2
a night that will always be remembered for @entity249 and his thunderous left boot			0
dancing for joy : @entity220 players celebrate @entity249 's ( second left ) goal at the @entity217			0

@entity18 looks back at the last four @entity2 opening matches
@entity33 scored an own goal to give @entity6 a 2 - 1 win against @entity25 in @entity23 ' 98
@entity97 's @entity105 shocked @entity23 in their 1 - 0 victory in the 2002 @entity2
@entity171 's *screamer* helped hosts @entity154 record a 4 - 2 win against @entity153 in the 2006 *showpiece*
@entity239 's *belter* gave @entity220 a 1 - 1 draw @entity219 in 2010
