by @entity0 published : 10:42 est , 22 april 2013 updated : 10:42 est , 22 april 2013 giant caverns have been excavated under @entity2 as work continues on the monumental @entity5 project			2
the stunning images released by the @entity7 show the scale of the task as concrete is mined and blasted up to 27 meters below ground			1
the giant underground caves will one day be the city 's @entity13 - one of the three being built in the $ 4.45billion project			1
construction workers have carved out huge caverns below @entity2 as they make room for the @entity5 's future 86th @entity13 large diggers appear tiny in the enormous caves that have been dug as part of the project , which has been in the pipeline for decades construction workers are excavating between 15 and 27 meters underground and work continues for up to 24 hours a day once complete , the @entity5 project will include a two - track line along @entity28 from @entity29 to the @entity30 in @entity31			1
over two miles of tunnels are being built across the city as planners aim to reduce connection on @entity2 's transport network			0
the @entity37 is being mined , which is an added challenge because of the number of high - value properties at street level			2
construction work continues up to 24 hours a day , with the majority of @entity2 unaware of the mammoth feat carrying on underground			1
phase 1 of the project is scheduled for completion in december 2016			2
it will include the new @entity37 and new stations on 96th and 72nd streets and new entrances to the existing @entity54 station			0
construction workers have bored tunnels underground that will eventually stretch from 92nd street to @entity58 phase one of the @entity5 is due for completion in december 2016 and include a connection to the existing 63rd @entity29 subway architects and construction workers are also building new @entity66 - accessible stations at @entity67 , @entity68 and @entity69 the $ 4.45billion subway will reduce overcrowding and delays on the @entity73 and aims to improve travel for city and suburban commuters the first of four construction phases sees the excavation of the tunnels from 105th street to 63th street and @entity81 , with new stations along @entity28 the final design for @entity84 of the project began in april 2006 and the construction contract was first awarded in march the following year planners predict an extra 200,000 people will be transported on the system when it is finished			1
authorities say travel times and conditions for city and suburban commuters will be improved by the new lines			0
travel from the @entity97 is expected to be ten minutes faster and divert 23,500 riders a day from the overcrowded @entity73			0
the monumental construction project will expand @entity2 transport system , which is already the nation 's biggest mass transit system carrying 5million passengers a day construction methods across the project vary because of different conditions and range from tunnel boring machinery to mined drill and blast the final design for @entity84 of the project began in april 2006 and the construction contract was first awarded in march the following year work on the stations and new subway is going on between 15 and 27 meters below the bustling roads of @entity31 @entity2 are mostly unaware of the heavy duty work going on beneath their feet day and night the expansion of the network was originally proposed in the 1920s but was shelved due to the @entity119 and @entity120 several stretches of tunnels with tracks were built in the 1970s but once more was put on hold because of a lack of funds			1
the existing tunnels are now being incorporated into the new ones			0
the @entity2 transport system is already the biggest in the @entity130 , carrying 5million passengers a day .			0

construction work on the $ 4.45billion second avenue subway project has continues this month
pictures released by @entity7 *reveals* the tunnels mined up to 27 meters underground
@entity37 is due to be completed in the first phase of the project by december 2016
