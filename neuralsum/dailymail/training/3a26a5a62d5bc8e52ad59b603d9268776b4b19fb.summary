ships could be sailing right across the @entity3 by the middle of the century , @entity1 experts predict			1
by around 2050 the @entity7 ice sheet will be thin enough for icebreakers to carve a straight path between the @entity10 and @entity11 , it is claimed			2
‘ nobody 's ever talked about shipping over the top of the @entity3 , ’ said lead researcher professor @entity12 , from the @entity13 in @entity14			1
‘ this is an entirely unexpected possibility			0
’ meanwhile , cargo ships and tankers could routinely be making voyages through @entity7 channels that are currently impossible for them to navigate on their own			1
ships could be sailing right across the @entity3 by the middle of the century , @entity1 experts predict the scientists studied seven well - established climate simulations for the years 2040 to 2059 to estimate the future thickness of sea ice in the @entity7			1
they then used a computer programme to look for potential new shipping routes opening up in september , the @entity7 's most navigable month of the year			2
by mid-century most common open - water ships will be able , without the help of icebreakers , to cross the @entity34 hugging the coast of @entity36 , the forecast shows			1
the route is about 40 per cent shorter than plotting a course through the @entity40			1
sailing directly over the @entity3 would provide a passage for icebreakers between the world 's two greatest oceans which is 20 per cent shorter than the @entity34			1
even the fabled and notoriously treacherous @entity45 , which traces @entity47 's coastline , could be opened up to ordinary shipping , say the researchers			0
it is expected to become navigable for vessels which are strengthened against ice , and even some ships with unreinforced hulls			2
today , the @entity45 can only be crossed in one of every seven years on average , making it too unreliable for commercial shipping			0
but by 2050 the september sea ice is expected to melt to the point that it is accessible every other year			2
for centuries the @entity7 has captured the imagination of explorers because of the possibility of travelling between the @entity10 and @entity11 oceans through the @entity65			0
by 2050 the @entity7 ice sheet will be thin enough for icebreakers to carve a path between the @entity10 and @entity11 until recently , thick ice has blocked this inviting short cut linking @entity71 with @entity72 and @entity73			2
but in the past two years , the ice has started to melt in late summer sufficiently to allow ordinary vessels escorted by icebreakers to venture into the @entity7			0
last summer , a total of 46 voyages were successfully completed along the @entity34			1
the new research is published online in the journal @entity81			0
scenarios assuming low - to - medium and relatively high increases in temperature both had the same dramatic impact on @entity7 sea ice , the scientists found			0
‘ no matter what carbon emission scenario is considered , by mid-century we will have passed a crucial tipping point - sufficiently thin sea ice - enabling moderately capable icebreakers to go where they please , ’ said professor @entity12			0
the predictions have major implications for commercial shipping , the exploitation of natural resources and the jurisdiction of shipping lanes			0
a more accessible @entity7 could also fuel international disagreements , say the researchers			0
for instance , @entity47 has long maintained that the @entity45 falls under its sovereignty while the @entity1 maintains it is an international stretch of water			1
while the passage is essentially un-navigable , the issue is moot			0
but increasing accessibility could bring the @entity1 into a dispute with its northern neighbour			1
the prospect of open - water ships entering the @entity7 in late summer also heightens the need for international regulations protecting the environment and ensuring the safety of sailors , the researchers added .			2

ships could be sailing across the @entity3 by 2050 , @entity1 experts predict
@entity34 is 20 per cent shorter than the @entity34 currently used
cargo ships will be taking routes that are currently *impassable*
