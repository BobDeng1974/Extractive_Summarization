by @entity0 , @entity1 correspondent this is the moment social services took a baby away from its parents when it was just six hours old			1
the infant at the centre of the @entity11 judgment , known only as @entity12 , was removed from its parents after his birth in april			2
the father secretly filmed the seizure on a webcam attached to the family computer			1
scroll down video the six - hour - old baby is cradled by its father as a police officer stands close by in the secretly recorded video the mother is clearly distraught in the video as @entity28 social workers and police take the baby away it has long been available on the internet but an edited version can only now be published and viewed legitimately			1
the views of the father and mother of the four children taken into care by @entity28 social workers can also now be published following yesterday 's landmark judgment by @entity41 sir @entity11			1
in june the baby 's father was given a suspended six - week prison sentence by a family court judge for his refusal to co-operate in getting the video removed from internet sites			2
the parents said social workers removed their baby because they decided their mother was incapable of bringing them up because of her learning disability			1
the video shows the father holding the newborn infant at their home when social workers and police come to take it away			1
in the video , the mother is clearly distraught and holds onto her baby and rocks it as her husband remonstrates with officers and council staff			1
one social worker can be heard telling the parents : ' we are going to take [ baby @entity12 ]			1
i do n't want to have to get physical			2
' the mother can be heard wailing and screaming ' no ' as social workers take her baby			1
the baby 's father told the @entity79 : ' i taped over the light on the webcam so the social workers could n't see it was switched on			1
' the couple - who can not be named - have lost four children who were removed by social workers			1
three have now been adopted			2
the father said yesterday they have never been accused of harming their children			0
cases in which children have been taken from families with learning difficulties have been acutely controversial over the last decade			0
campaigners and some academics say over-zealous social workers have broken up families led by parents who are no threat to their children and who can look after them capably			1
a version of the video can be published for the first time after sir @entity11 said the father could share it one social worker can be heard saying : ' we are here to take [ baby j ]			1
i do n't want to have to get physical ' the father told the @entity79 : ' the social workers said my wife and i were in a volatile relationship			1
but we have been married for a long time and we do bicker a bit			2
we have differences of opinion			0
' there has never been violence , and nobody has ever said there is any evidence to say otherwise			0
' the father said his oldest daughter was seven years old when she was taken from her parents four years ago			0
' there were no problems for seven years , ' he said			0
' then we had a new social worker who had a different attitude			2
' my wife has a learning disability and for a period i was depressed , although that was quickly over after the @entity136 helped			0
but the social worker tried to section me			2
the court was told that there was a risk the children would come to harm in the future			0
' they were never harmed			0
they were taken away as a preventative or precautionary measure			0
' sir @entity11 rejected a sweeping injunction designed to effectively prevent anyone in the world from seeing the film , knowing the names of the social workers involved , or even discovering the name of the local authority that applied for the order , @entity156			1
the newborn baby can be heard crying during the distressing seizure sir @entity11 said the baby 's father should not be prevented from sharing information about the case after @entity164 tried to gag him the father said that although social workers considered his wife disabled , the wife 's disability benefits were halted after intervention by @entity28 council staff			1
the parents , who do not work , were supported by family and by church food parcels for nearly nine months , he said , before state benefits to the wife were restored			0
he said he acted as his wife 's carer			0
the father , 41 , had been married to the mother , 36 , for 13 years			0
the couple are permitted to see the eldest daughter six times a year under agreements settled in court , the father said			2
but he added : ' we have only been allowed to see her once this year			0
she wants to come home			0
' a test case in @entity192 in 2005 involved the parents of a four - year - old girl and a 14 - month - old boy removed from their home even though they were clean , well - dressed , well fed , much loved , and had never been harmed			0
the case attracted attention because @entity192 social workers used court injunctions to prevent the parents from discussing their children or anyone from reporting the case			1
a high court judge backed the council and said it was unrealistic for the parents to expect to bring up their children			0
sir @entity11 said of @entity28 's attempt to silence the parents in yesterday 's case : ' the father wishes to share information with others			2
why should he not be able to do so ? ' and why should those who may wish to hear his views not be permitted to approach him ? ' this is in effect , if not in intention , a means of indirectly gagging the father so that what from the local authority 's perspective are his unpalatable views are less likely to see the light of day			0
' sir @entity11 added : ' i simply fail to see how naming the local authority , the social workers , the local authority 's legal representative or the children 's guardian , or even all of them , can in any realistic way be said to make it likely that @entity12 will be identified , even indirectly			1
' the risk is merely fanciful			0
