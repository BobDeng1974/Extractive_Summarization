@entity0 has released a slickly produced new video warning the @entity2 of the carnage it wants to inflict in @entity5 if president @entity6 deploys troops to the war - torn nation as he attempts to ' degrade and ultimately destroy ' the terror group			1
resembling a blockbuster movie trailer , the disturbing 52 - second video entitled ' @entity14 ' shows militants blowing up tanks in dramatic slow motion , wounded @entity2 soldiers apparently being executed and the @entity18 in the sights of a shaky camera			1
it then shows a clip of the president from before the 2011 withdrawal from @entity5 saying that combat troops will never return to the @entity28 nation , before the video ends with a text overlay that reads , ' @entity22 -- fighting has just begun ... coming soon			1
the video was released by the @entity45 , which has become known for its propaganda videos for @entity0 which include high - production values , cgi explosions and slow motion footage			1
the video also appears to mock the @entity2 by including an image of the infamous ' @entity53 ' banner that made an appearance on board @entity55 during @entity58 's victory speech in 2003 following the @entity2 - led invasion of @entity5			1
president @entity58 's former defense secretary @entity60 also makes an appearance in the video , walking through @entity5 during the occupation			2
destruction : during the video @entity0 soldiers are seen to unleash multiple and successful strikes on @entity2 troops and tanks in the @entity28 blast : the video - which bears all the hallmarks of a highly produced @entity74 trailer shows the destruction of @entity2 military targets at the hands of @entity0 that image is then followed by a picture of the @entity18 at night , filmed by a moving camera from what is presumably a car driving past			1
the movie is just the latest heavily edited video from @entity0 , that has included gruesome footage of the beheadings of two @entity2 journalists and a @entity89 aid worker			1
@entity39 told a @entity91 panel on tuesday that @entity2 troops might soon provide @entity5 forces with ' close combat advising ' in the fight against the @entity0 terror army			1
that clarification of the @entity99 's mission in the @entity28 could mean that @entity2 soldiers and @entity101 are embedded with @entity5 army units , helping them conduct warfare			1
heavily armed : @entity105 police officers stand guard in @entity107 on september 17 , 2014 in @entity105			0
a blog affiliated with the @entity109 in @entity5 and @entity110 ( @entity0 ) mentioned @entity107 as a target for bombing slow motion : @entity0 militants are seen to heroically survive @entity2 attacks and retaliate with superior force in the video gen. @entity39 , who chairs the military 's @entity40 , told the @entity41 that the @entity2 military is currently serving a purely advisory role			1
but in certain circumstances , he said , they might provide ' close combat advising			0
' citing a hypothetically urgent mission focused on ' retaking @entity125 ' as anti-war protesters provided frequent interruptions , he said he could envision @entity2 troops ' accompanying that mission			1
' asked by @entity131 @entity130 sen. @entity130 whether the president has ruled out the use of @entity2 ground forces in a combat role , @entity39 responded , ' yes			2
but he has told me as well to come back to him on a case - by - case basis			0
' he said that if needed , he ' would go back to the president and make a recommendation that may include the use of ground forces			0
' mocking : the video attacks president @entity58 's assertion in 2003 that the invasion of @entity5 was completed ominous : the video shows a brief and shaky clip of a car driving past the @entity18 filming it - clearly threatening the home of the @entity2 president in his opening statement , he said that ' if we reach the point where i believe our advisers should accompany @entity5 troops on attacks against specific @entity0 targets , i will recommend that to the president			1
' @entity0 is an alternate name for @entity0			2
president @entity6 has maintained that @entity2 forces wo n't have a combat mission in @entity5			1
but @entity165 @entity164 sen. @entity164 said tuesday that he 's not convinced the @entity18 is true to its word			2
' it will take an army to beat an army , but instead the president presented a limited counter-terrorism strategy , ' @entity164 said during the hearing			0
' his claim of " no boots on the ground " is an insult to the men and women in @entity5 today who are serving in harm ’s way			2
we already have boots on the ground in @entity184 and in @entity185 and throughout @entity5			2
' @entity40 chairman gen. @entity39 ( right ) said he might recommend inserting @entity2 troops to ' accompany ' @entity5 in combat situations , if airstrikes failed to neutralize @entity0 protesters , from the far - left @entity191 , numbered at least 10 -- all of whom managed to get into the hearing room without a challenge from @entity195 @entity39 and defense secretary @entity196 faced multiple questions from lawmakers in the first high - stakes hearing examining @entity6 's expanded military campaign to counter the relentless terrorist threat from @entity28 extremists			1
the @entity2 military conducted strikes near @entity185 against @entity0 , the self - proclaimed @entity0			1
@entity0 has seized large swaths of @entity5 and @entity110			1
@entity6 is seeking congressional support to train and equip vetted @entity110 moderates fighting both the @entity0 militants and forces loyal to president @entity210			0
@entity39 said the @entity2 is prepared to strike @entity0 targets in @entity110			2
' this will not look like " shock and awe " because that is not how @entity0 is organized			0
but it will be persistent and sustainable , ' @entity39 said , referring to the air bombardment at the start of the @entity5 war in march 2003			0
' because @entity0 operates freely across the @entity5 - @entity110 border , and maintains a safe haven in @entity110 , our actions will not be restrained by a border in name only , ' he said			1
doing @entity6 's bidding : @entity219 , shown with the president after a @entity229 ceremony on monday , is responsible for implementing his policies -- and taking blame if they fail or if ' mission creep ' kicks in several lawmakers have their doubts about the @entity2 being pulled into a larger war , with increasing numbers of @entity2 troops			1
the president has already dispatched more than 1,000 @entity2 three years after combat forces left @entity5			2
many @entity242 and @entity243 have expressed reservations about the ability to identify moderates in a country awash with rebel formations and shifting alliances			0
the @entity109 grew out of the @entity251 movement , but the two are now fighting			0
in some instances , the moderate @entity253 has teamed with @entity251 's local franchise , the @entity255			0
@entity219 said the @entity2 will monitor them closely to ensure that weapons do n't fall into the wrong hands			0
' there will always be risk in a program like this , but we believe that risk is justified by the imperative of destroying @entity0 – and the necessity of having capable partners on the ground in @entity110 , ' the defense secretary said			2
anti-war protesters filled the front rows at the hearing , chanting ' no more war ! no more war ! no military solution ! ' at the start of the session and repeatedly interrupting testimony			0
' @entity279 is not the answer ! ' one activist yelled as @entity219 was introduced			0
@entity41 chairman sen. @entity282 , a @entity284 @entity283 , snapped			0
' would you please now leave ? i 'm asking you to please leave			0
you 're acting very warlike yourself , ' @entity282 told them			0
@entity219 said the involvement will not be ' an easy or brief effort			0
we are at war with @entity0 , as we are with @entity251			0

@entity0 release video threat to the @entity296 on tuesday entitled ' @entity22 '
the 52 - second clip resembles a @entity74 movie trailer and threatens @entity2 troops
is the latest in a line of well - produced videos from @entity0 and shows the apparent execution of @entity2 soldiers
also features an eerie night - time drive past of the @entity18 and finishes with the ominous words , ' coming soon '
is believed to be a response to @entity2 warnings that ground troops may be deployed to @entity5
