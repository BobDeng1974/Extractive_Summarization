@entity0 : the permanent operation that will leave the man substituting food for liquid was sanctioned by health workers rather than a court of law an autistic young man had all his healthy teeth removed on the orders of doctors , it was revealed yesterday			1
the permanent operation left the man facing the rest of his life subsisting on liquids or forced to use dentures to chew solid food			1
the decision to carry out the procedure and inflict a long - term disability was not tested in a court of law or approved by a judge , according to evidence provided by lawyers who work in the secretive and controversial @entity27			2
instead it was taken in secret after it is believed the @entity27 ruled that the man was mentally unfit to decide for himself			1
health workers said the procedure was necessary to stop the man from harming himself			2
the harsh and radical dental operation was disclosed in files presented to a @entity38 committee investigating the @entity27 and the law which gave birth to it , @entity42 ’s @entity41			1
it follows the scandal last month over the decision of a @entity27 judge to order a forced caesarean operation on a pregnant @entity49 woman who had been detained under mental health laws after suffering a breakdown at @entity52			1
the treatment of @entity54 - whose baby was taken by @entity57 social workers for adoption in @entity59 - led to a renewed wave of calls for greater openness in the courts and from social and health workers who take life - changing decisions about families and patients behind closed doors			1
the removal of the autistic man ’s teeth came in a submission to peers by a group of lawyers who work regularly in the @entity27 , which was set up by @entity42 ’s mental capacity law to take decisions on health care and finance for people too ill to decide for themselves			1
led by barrister @entity82 , the lawyers said that among the defects of the law and the @entity27 is ‘ confusion about what counts as serious medical treatment and when health professionals need to go to court to obtain declarations			2
’ investigation : the news emerged as the @entity38 investigates the @entity27 made by @entity42 they added : ‘ one example is a case in which an autistic young adult had all his teeth permanently removed to stop him self - harming , without the @entity27 ’s involvement			1
’ in keeping with the secrecy surrounding such decisions in the @entity105 , children ’s and adult social work departments , and often in the family courts and the @entity27 , no further details of the incident were discussed in nearly 2,000 pages of evidence which has now been published by the @entity108			0
the lawyers called for a string of reforms to the @entity41 and the @entity27 , including changes to the ‘ deprivation of liberty ’ powers which allow judges to order someone to be detained in a care home			0
the @entity108 , which is expected to report this year , was also told about research into the workings of the act commissioned by the @entity122 , but never publicised			0
researchers from @entity124 and @entity125 said aspects of the law were ‘ worrying ’ and criticised the way the @entity27 decides when someone has no capacity to think for themselves			0
the case follows that of @entity132 who was forced to have her baby by caesarean section then removed from her by @entity57 social services and put up for adoption they said there was confusion over ‘ the distinction between unwise decisions and a lack of decision making capacity			0
’ the case of the young man whose teeth were taken out comes after months of growing disquiet at the high - handed and secretive behaviour of @entity27 judges			0
concerns were raised in april last year after the @entity151 revealed that a judge had jailed a woman called @entity154 for contempt of court after she tried to take her father away from a care home where he had been ordered to stay			2
miss @entity154 , who had no lawyer to represent her in court , was imprisoned secretly and no - one was allowed to know her name until the @entity151 investigated the case			0
the most senior family court judge , sir @entity162 , has since ordered that no - one should ever again be jailed in secret			2
he is also pressing judges to break the routine @entity27 secrecy by publishing judgements			0
new rules are also expected this year to allow greater public access to @entity27 hearings .			0
