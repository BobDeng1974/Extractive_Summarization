by @entity0 published : 09:37 est , 19 july 2012 updated : 10:02 est , 19 july 2012 killer : @entity2 , pictured in 2002 , is appealing against his ' inhuman ' whole life sentence despite committing multiple murders mass killer @entity2 is to appeal against the decision to put him behind bars for the rest of his life because it is ' inhuman and degrading , ' it was revealed today			1
in november the 51 - year - old , who murdered his parents , his sister and her two children in 1985 , will have his case heard in @entity19 's @entity18 , the appeal court of the @entity18			1
two other @entity21 killers will also appeal in cases that will test whether the @entity21 ’s law allowing the most dangerous offenders to be sentenced to whole life tariffs , with almost no chance of release , is cruel			1
@entity2 has appealed again after @entity29 ’s human rights judges ruled in january that @entity21 ’s most notorious criminals could be kept behind bars for the rest of their lives			1
the @entity18 held by four votes to three that there had been no violation of @entity37 of the @entity38 , which is enshrined in @entity21 law under the @entity40 and prohibits ' inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment '			1
condemning people to die in jail was not ' grossly disproportionate ' and in each case @entity48 ’s @entity47 had ' decided that an all - life tariff was required , relatively recently and following a fair and detailed consideration ' , the judges ruled			2
this will now be tested by the court ’s @entity18 after a panel of five judges also granted the appeal by killer @entity56 , who stabbed his wife in february 2008			1
@entity59 's sentence , handed down after he killed four gay men for his sexual gratification in 1995 , will also be considered by the @entity18 judges			2
@entity2 ’s solicitor , @entity63 , said today : ' he ’s obviously delighted with the decision			2
case : judges at the @entity18 in @entity19 , pictured , will here the case of @entity2 and two other murderers in november ' it demonstrates that his case remains arguable and he looks forward to presenting his position at the @entity18 in due course			1
' mr @entity63 went on : ' it is part of his long battle to challenge the home secretary of the day going beyond what the trial judge said would be the appropriate sentence he should receive			0
' he ’s encouraged by it , but he ’s realistic and acknowledges that it ’s just another stepping point			0
' the final analysis will depend on what the @entity18 says in the end			2
' @entity2 ’s legal team originally submitted the application to the @entity18 in december 2009			1
but their claims were strongly opposed by justice secretary @entity87 , who has said the government has been ' fighting the case vigorously and defending the principle of the whole - life tariff			0
' under current law , whole - life tariff prisoners will almost certainly never be released from prison as their offences are deemed to be so serious			0
they can be freed only by the justice secretary , who can give discretion on compassionate grounds when the prisoner is terminally ill or seriously incapacitated			0
scandal : a sobbing @entity2 with his girlfriend @entity103 at his family 's funeral in 1985 but a year later he was convicted of their murders cold - blooded : @entity2 murdered his parents @entity110 and @entity111 , left , and sister @entity112 and her children @entity114 and @entity115 , right , but wants to be released from prison before he dies @entity2 has been behind bars for more than 25 years for shooting his wealthy adopted parents june and @entity124 , his sister @entity119 and her six - year - old twin sons @entity114 and @entity115 at their farmhouse in @entity122 , @entity123			1
the 51 - year - old was given a whole - life tariff after being convicted of the murders in october 1986			0
but he has always protested his innocence and claims his schizophrenic sister ms @entity119 shot her family before turning the gun on herself in a remote @entity123 farmhouse			0
in 2009 , @entity2 lost a @entity134 challenge against the order that he must die behind bars			1
he has twice lost appeals against conviction			0
@entity56 was released from prison after serving nine years for the 1995 murder of work colleague @entity141 , 22			0
three years later he stabbed wife @entity142 four times and strangled her , before being given a whole - life order			0
@entity59 was convicted of four counts of murder in 1996 after killing four gay men for his sexual gratification			0
it is the latest case where @entity29 ’s human rights court could try to overrule @entity21 judges			2
in may , judges at the @entity18 once again ruled against @entity21 ’s blanket ban on prisoners voting and gave the government six months to change the law			1
prime minister @entity158 has said the idea of relaxing the ban ' makes me physically ill ' and officials are working out how to respond to the court ’s demand .			0

@entity18 of @entity18 will consider his case and that of two other @entity21 killers in november
