anywhere @entity19 goes and you can live in an air - conditioned yurt is not for me			1
@entity5 singled out @entity19 for particular criticism , saying anywhere she goes ' is not for me ' ‘ we ’ll leave the middle classes to do @entity3 and the rest of the great unwashed will decamp to @entity12 and drink lots of beer and have fun			1
