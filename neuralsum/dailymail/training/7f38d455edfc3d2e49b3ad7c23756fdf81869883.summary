published : 09:48 est , 18 november 2012 updated : 12:32 est , 19 november 2012 as the @entity2 divorce rate continues to soar , a new study has today shown how marital harmony is thriving in the penguin world			2
research has revealed a pair of @entity8 penguins as among the most faithful in the animal kingdom			1
the couple have remained loyal to each other over a 16 - year period , in spite of spending thousands of miles apart during their winter trips			1
previously penguin relationships were believed to span a maximum of just 10 years , with many cut short by the unexpected death of birds during migration			1
' @entity40 ' is also a possibility as couples who fail to hatch chicks will split up and find new mates			0
but according to @entity45 , biologists have been surprised by the longevity of the relationship between a particular couple			1
' the bond they have is incredible really , ' lead researcher dr @entity49 , of the @entity50 of @entity33 , told the newspaper			1
' it is unbelievable how far magellanic penguins swim â€“ and each breeding season they come back to the same nest and to the same partner			0
' loyal : a pair of penguins can track each other down among hundreds of thousands of other birds using a distinctive call the research was revealed during a lecture to the @entity65 in @entity66 , and dr @entity49 will set out his findings in a book to be published next year called @entity70 : @entity71 and @entity72			1
magellanic penguins can only be found around the @entity73 and @entity74			0
loving : a magellanic penguin stays loyal to the same mate , in spite of long periods apart @entity33 has the highest population , with 900,000 breeding pairs in @entity33 , while there are 800,000 couples in @entity83			1
but their numbers have dropped dramatically since the turn of the century due to oil pollution and falling fish numbers and there are thought to be around 1.2 million left in the world			0
dr @entity49 's project also used satellite tracking to identify the movements of the birds , showing the enormous journeys they travel each winter to the warmer waters of @entity97			2
every year , the penguins arrive at their summer nests in the southern hemisphere and find their partners using a distinctive call			0
after reuniting and mating , the female usually lay two eggs , which each partner takes turns guarding while the other goes out to sea			0
after they hatch , the parents spend a month caring for their young before heading off to their wintering area			0
the penguins join a roll call of other animals that undertake loyal relationships , including the albatross , @entity118 angelfish and black vultures			0
mates for life : in spite of long distance flights , albatrosses always return to breed with the same partners @entity126 : like the @entity22 penguin , black vultures are strictly monogamous			2

@entity70 couple stayed together for 16 years , *smashing* all previous records
new research shows incredible loyalty in spite of the epic distances travelled by the birds
