the @entity1 satellite , also known as the ‘ @entity2 of space ’ , is expected to make a fiery fall to @entity5 sometime between the end of this month and the start of november			1
with a sleek , aerodynamic design responsible for it being dubbed the ‘ @entity2 of space ’ , @entity1 has mapped variations in @entity5 ’s gravity with extreme detail			1
after more than four years on its mission , the one - tonne goce satellite will fall rapidly through the atmosphere , burning up as it descends			2
at a height of 224km , @entity1 's orbit is so low that it experiences drag from the outer edges of @entity5 's atmosphere			1
the satellite 's streamline structure and use of electric propulsion system counteract atmospheric drag to ensure that the data are of true gravity			2
while most of @entity1 will disintegrate in the atmosphere , @entity37 expects that around 25 per cent might reach @entity5 ’s surface			1
when and where these parts might land can not yet be predicted , but the affected area will be narrowed down closer to the time of re-entry			0
taking into account that two thirds of @entity5 is covered by oceans and vast areas are thinly populated , the danger to life or property is very low			0
about 40 tonnes of manmade space debris reach the ground per year , but the spread and size mean the risk of an individual being struck is lower than being hit by a meteorite			1
the @entity1 ( @entity1 ) has been orbiting @entity5 since march 2009 at the lowest altitude of any research satellite			1
during its mission , it has produced a unique model of the ‘ geoid ’ , which is essentially a virtual surface where water does not flow from one point to another			0
during its mission , @entity1 has produced a unique model of the geoid , which is essentially a virtual surface where water does not flow from one point to another			0
the colours in the image represent deviations in height from an ideal geoid			0
the blue shades represent low values and the reds / yellows represent high values around mid-october , the mission will come to a natural end when it runs out of fuel and the satellite begins its descent towards @entity5 from a height of about 224km			2
re-entry is expected to happen about three weeks after the fuel is depleted			0
an international campaign is monitoring the descent , involving the @entity103			0
the situation is being continuously watched by the @entity37 ’s @entity105 , which will issue re-entry predictions and risk assessments .			2

@entity1 has spent four years mapping @entity5 ’s gravity with *incredible* *precision*
it 's return will be the first uncontrolled re-entry of an @entity37 satellite since 1987
the risk of an individual being struck is lower than being hit by a meteorite
