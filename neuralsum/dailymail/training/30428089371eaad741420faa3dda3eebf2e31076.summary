the @entity15 amateur rider appeared uninjured and quickly got to her feet clutching her helmet in disappointment			2
so far so good : @entity9 looked unbeatable approaching the line ... ... but after jinking to the left he collided with the rail and there was no way back for @entity7 ...			1
... and it was left to @entity26 to claim the honours recovering after her fall @entity30 compared her fall to a ' @entity33 film '			1
' when i hit the ground i thought i was dreaming			0

i dedicate this victory to him , if that does any good			0
