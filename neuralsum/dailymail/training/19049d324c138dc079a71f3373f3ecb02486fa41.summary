a police officer in @entity1 made an incredibly generous gesture this week after it appears some creep did the unthinkable : stole the wedding ring of an elderly @entity6 's patient who is sedated in a hospital			1
the yellow - gold diamond engagement ring has been on the hand of 87 - year - old @entity10 for the last 67 years - after her husband , @entity11 , bought it for her in the summer of 1946			1
' she said , " yes			0
" i remember i bought it at @entity16 jewelry			0
i paid $ 400 for it , ' @entity11 told a local news outlet			2
' i came in the morning , and i 'm holding her hand , talking to her , and the ring is gone			0
' love birds : @entity11 remembers the day 67 years ago when his wife , @entity23 , said yes to his marriage proposal hero : when plantation police officer @entity27 was assigned the case she was heartbroken for the elderly couple when plantation police officer @entity27 was tasked with investigating the apparent theft at the @entity31 in @entity32 , she was overcome with grief over what had happened to the still - beaming couple			1
' after 67 years of that ring being on her finger , she still looked at him like he was her knight in shinning armor , and he looked at her like she was still his young bride , ' @entity27 tells @entity41			1
so @entity27 did what she could to replace @entity11 's ring			1
