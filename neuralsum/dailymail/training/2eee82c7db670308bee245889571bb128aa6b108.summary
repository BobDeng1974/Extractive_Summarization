the head of self - driving cars for @entity2 expects real people to be using them on public roads in two to five years			1
@entity5 says the cars would still be test vehicles , and @entity2 would collect data on how they interact with other vehicles and pedestrians			1
@entity2 is working on sensors to detect road signs and other vehicles , and software that analyzes all the data			1
the small , bulbous cars without steering wheels or pedals are being tested at a @entity2 facility in @entity31			1
@entity5 would n't give a date for putting driverless cars on roads en masse , saying that the system has to be safe enough to work properly			0
he told reporters wednesday at the @entity37 in @entity38 that @entity2 does n't know yet how it will make money on the cars			1
@entity5 wants to reach the point where his test team no longer has to pilot the cars			2
' what we really need is to get to the point where we 're learning about how people interact with it , how they are using it , and how can we best bring that to market as a product that people care for , ' he said			0
@entity2 may face state regulatory hurdles depending on where it chooses to test the cars in public			1
under legislation that @entity2 persuaded @entity31 lawmakers to pass in 2012 , self - driving cars must have a steering wheel and pedals			1
several other states have passed laws formally allowing autonomous cars on public roads without that restriction			0
the company in december announced that it had a fully functioning prototype that 's been driving on its test track			0
the small , bulbous cars without steering wheels or pedals are being tested at a @entity2 facility in @entity31			1
it hoped to see the cars on the road in northern @entity31 this year , but they would have to have safety drivers and temporary manual controls			0
@entity2 also confirmed that it has hired @entity84 , a @entity38 - area company that designs and builds prototypes for the auto industry , to build 150 prototype @entity2 autonomous cars			1
@entity5 said @entity2 is making laser and other sensors for the cars smaller and less costly			1
he predicted that the cars would fail at some point on public roads , but said @entity2 's cars have been driven more than 700,000 miles on public roads without causing a crash			1
@entity2 has begun discussions with most of the world 's top automakers in a bid to get self driving cars on the road by 2020			1
' we 'd be remiss not to talk to ... the biggest auto manufacturers			0
they 've got a lot to offer , ' @entity5 , director of @entity2 's self - driving car project , said			2
@entity2 's prototype two - seater ' bubble ' cars have buttons to begin and end the drive , but no other controls			1
an on - board computer uses data from sensors , including radar , a laser and cameras , to make turns and negotiate its way around pedestrians and other vehicles			1
under the vision unveiled by @entity2 , passengers might set their destination by typing it into a map or using commands			2
the cars are also expected to be electric , capable of going 100 miles ( 160 km ) before needing to be recharging			0
the front of the vehicle has a soft foam - like material where a traditional bumper would be and a more flexible windscreen , in an attempt to be safer for pedestrians			0
the prototypes are restricted to speeds of 25mph ( 40 km / h ) and the ability to self - drive will depend on specifically designed @entity2 road maps tested on the company 's current fleet of vehicles			1
but ultimately the vehicles will be faster and will be able to use @entity2 's extended maps service , using gps technology to locate the vehicle 's exact position on an electronic map			1
a combination of radar , lasers and cameras sitting on top of the roof give the car a 360 - degree ' view ' , with sensors linked to computer software able to ' see ' and identify people , cars , road signs and markings and traffic lights			0
those manufacturers , he said , include @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 ' for us to jump in and say that we can do this better , that 's arrogant , ' @entity5 said			0
@entity2 has not determined whether it will build its own self - driving vehicles or function more as a provider of systems and software to established vehicle manufacturers			1
@entity2 's self - driving prototype cars , he said , were built in @entity38 by engineering and specialty manufacturing company @entity84			1
@entity18 is open to working with @entity2 on self - driving cars , @entity179 , @entity18 's chief technology officer , said on monday			2
@entity5 's expectation that the first fully autonomous vehicles will be production - ready within five years mirrors the view expressed a day earlier by another @entity185 entrepreneur , @entity184 , chief executive of @entity186			0
@entity184 , who spoke tuesday at the @entity37 conference , said he expects the lack of clear federal regulations covering self - driving cars could delay their introduction until 2022 or 2023			0
@entity5 , however , said his @entity2 colleagues ' do n't see any particular regulatory hurdles			2
' @entity2 has been briefing the @entity193 , the chief @entity194 auto regulator , ' from early on in our program , ' @entity5 said			2
' the worst thing we could do is surprise them			0
' @entity2 has already adapted cars to include its self driving technology @entity5 said @entity2 is developing and refining self - driving systems and components with such auto parts suppliers as @entity205 , @entity206 , @entity207 and @entity208			2
@entity2 's prototype cars use microprocessors made by @entity211 , a @entity185 chipmaker that also supplies @entity212 and other automakers			2
@entity205 said it began discussions in 2012 about supplying parts for @entity2 's self - driving car			2
@entity2 asked the @entity218 supplier to provide tires , some electronics and other components , according to @entity222 , chief executive of @entity205 's @entity224 region			2
@entity2 shortly will begin deploying a test fleet of fully functioning prototypes of its pod - like self - driving car , which dispenses with such familiar automotive parts as steering wheel , brakes and accelerator pedal			2
while each of the @entity2 prototypes will have a ' test driver ' on board , the cars have no provision for human intervention in steering or braking			1
@entity5 suggested the no - frills look of the @entity2 prototypes , a far cry from the opulent appearance of the self - driving @entity245 concept vehicle unveiled last week by @entity212 , does not necessarily reflect the final design for production			0
he described the @entity2 prototype as ' a practical , near - term testing platform ' that will evolve over time			0
' airliners today do n't look like the @entity253 ' flyer ' of 100 years ago , he said			0
@entity5 said self - driving cars represent a ' transformative ' moment in the evolution of transportation , an opportunity to extend motoring to blind , elderly and disabled persons who otherwise could not drive			0
' you 're really changing the relationship you have with transportation			0
you 're changing what it means to get around			0
' regarding @entity2 's desire to partner with traditional automakers and suppliers , @entity5 said @entity38 is more innovative than is sometimes acknowledged			1
automakers are ' doing something incredibly complicated			0
' ' you look at a car ... and people forget just how much magic there is in that thing			0

cars would still be test vehicles built by a @entity38 carmaker
@entity2 would collect data on interactions with vehicles and pedestrians
