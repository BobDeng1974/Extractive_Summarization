@entity0 has expressed her disappointment at completing only four laps on her full @entity4 debut			1
the 31 - year - old @entity5 became the first female driver to step into an @entity4 cockpit during a grand prix weekend in more than two decades when she took part in the opening practice session at @entity11 on friday morning			1
out : @entity12 ' @entity0 was massively disappointed with the way she retired in the opening practice history : the 31 - year - old became the first female driver to step into an @entity4 cockpit during a grand prix weekend but @entity0 lasted just 20 minutes of the one hour - and - a - half session before grinding to a halt on track with an oil - pressure problem			1
she completed just four laps and ended the session almost nine seconds down on championship leader @entity24 in his @entity25			1
‘ it is a massive disappointment , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ on the one side , we had such a good build - up to this weekend ; obviously i had put in so much hard work , so much preparation to get ready for today and i knew exactly what i had to do on every lap out there			2
sad end : marshals remove the car of @entity38 driver @entity0 after an oil - pressure problem ‘ it felt good - even the out lap - but that is racing , and i have known from over the years , that there can be massive ups and massive downs			1
’ breaking the norm : @entity0 is the first woman in 22 years to take part in @entity4 practice @entity0 will be handed another chance at the wheel of the @entity12 during practice for the @entity53 @entity52 later this month , but the @entity5 insists there wo n’t be added pressure on her to impress despite her horror show at @entity11			1
‘ it is very , very disappointing , but i have still got @entity58 , and i have to go out and show what i can do because i did not get the chance to do that today , ’ she added			0
‘ there is n’t extra pressure			0
it is about having the same approach , being well prepared and knowing exactly what i have to do			0
‘ you ca n’t expect to be on the grid unless you show that you are good enough to be there			0
until i have done a good job in @entity58 then i am not willing to say too much about the future			0
’ @entity72 , husband to @entity0 , and shareholder at @entity12 , was seen dining in the @entity76 team ’s new motorhome during lunch on friday			1
‘ he has been very suppoportive and i am incredibly lucky in that sense , ’ @entity0 said of her husband , and executive director at @entity25			2
‘ he is my biggest supporter , but also my biggest critic			0
he knew that i had to go out there and do a good job today and there was no chance of messing it up			0
he is quite sad that i did n’t get to show it			0
’ go again : @entity0 will be handed another chance at the wheel of the @entity12 in practice for the @entity53 gp			2
