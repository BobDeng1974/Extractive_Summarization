for some @entity2 supporters it was almost too much			1
in the aftermath of @entity8 ’s second goal a man in a green polo shirt and beige fishing hat leapt to his feet and stood before the directors ' box , arms outstretched			0
he stood silent , unmoving			0
after a second or two he rubbed his fingers together in the unmistakable , international sign language of money			0
his message was clear enough			0
this was the year when @entity2 gambled their @entity23 ambitions on spending the bare minimum			1
a year when they placed their chips on black and lost to a @entity28 team in red			1
the punt finished up costing them £ 15million			0

subs not used : @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 booked : @entity35			1
goals : @entity35 36 , @entity74 61 referee : @entity83 ( @entity84 ) for this old club the @entity23 has now become a tale of slow , steady decline			1
a process of corrosive decay culminating in something approaching humiliation			0
this time last year @entity94 ’s champions scraped past @entity95 of @entity96 to qualify for the group stages by the seat of their pants			1
since then they have played 10 games in this competition			0
they have won three – two against @entity107 - and losing seven			2
defeats by @entity109 , @entity110 and @entity111 they could tolerate			0
home and away losses to @entity8 are harder to explain			2
much of what happened here felt like a throwback			0
to routine , humble @entity117 exits to the @entity118 and @entity119 of this world			0
even the ultras of the @entity122 were rendered mute			0
at time up the there were no substantive boos , only numbness			2
this was a night which outlined the stark consequences of downsizing , selling key players , gambling and complacency			2
in the end the 6 - 1 aggregate scoreline was identical to that by which @entity8 beat the @entity137 part - timers of @entity138			1
and yet who can deny that @entity141 ’s team were thoroughly worthy winners over two games ? as a @entity144 player @entity141 never won an @entity146 game in five attempts			0
but that was against the @entity2 of @entity149 and @entity150			1
here @entity141 fared better , his @entity28 champions outclassing a desperately limited @entity2 side			1
describing just how poorly they played over two games is no easy task			0
doubling up : @entity74 scores @entity8 's second goal past @entity156 heading for the play - offs : @entity74 celebrates his strike which effectivley killed the tie easy street : @entity8 's @entity74 ( right ) is hailed on his goal by fellow scorer @entity35 concern : @entity2 chief executive @entity164 ( centre ) with chairman @entity166 and director @entity167 ( right ) trailing 4 - 1 from the first leg @entity32 needed a miracle here			1
on nights like these the @entity2 way is to stage a cavalry charge			1
to come out the trenches , bayonets poking forth			0
but there was none of that here			0
the ‘ home ’ team – playing at @entity41 – huffed and puffed			1
they barely laid a glove on the @entity182 , save for long range shots in either half from @entity48 and @entity55			2
@entity186 's successor is not entirely to blame for what transpired here			2
but it is a substantial blow to his credibility			0
@entity32 offered the view pre-match that it would hardly be the end of the world if @entity2 failed to qualify			1
at times his team – with 11 men on the park this time - played as if they took him at his word			1
it was all over in 35 minutes			2
any slim , remote hope of another storming comeback to match @entity201 , @entity202 , @entity203 or @entity204 was shattered when @entity35 raced onto a through ball from @entity74 and somehow managed to outpace and outwit a hopelessly indecisive @entity46			1
there were laments for the @entity209 ’s exclusion from the first leg in @entity211			2
but here he had one , two , chances to clear his lines			0
at the very worst @entity46 could have fouled @entity35 and taken the yellow			1
instead he allowed the striker to take control , sprint clear and calmly slot the ball past @entity39			0
heading through : @entity8 boss @entity141 celebrates with his assistant following their shock victory nightmare : @entity2 's @entity49 picks the ball out of the net following @entity8 's opening goal foot loose : @entity2 's @entity54 ( left ) and @entity8 's @entity65 battle for the ball keeper 's ball : @entity2 's @entity55 ( centre ) is beaten to the ball by @entity8 's @entity63 there were no wild , unrestrained celebrations from the rump of @entity8 supporters in the @entity235			1
they knew they were through from the early stages , from the period when their team settled into this game and looked utterly unruffled			0
the inevitable was merely confirmed on the hour mark when , once again , @entity46 was hesitant and negligent			0
the @entity209 surrendered possession close to his own area and a delightfully deft dinked through ball from @entity35 allowed @entity74 to ghost in and drag the ball wide before finishing brilliantly from an angle			1
on the bench @entity32 sat impassive , a coach alone in his thoughts			1
the new man tried changing things			0
he brought @entity51 in for @entity60 at the start			0
@entity55 replaced @entity257 , @entity49 played in central defence for the suspended @entity259 until he limped from the pitch injured after the hour			0
in truth it made no real difference			0
in the early stages , when @entity2 had to have the bit between the teeth , @entity8 looked tentative			1
for all of 10 minutes			2
after 20 they settled into the game			0
@entity2 could make no impact			1
glum : @entity32 looks on from the touchline in front of his @entity2 substitutes pitchside calling the shots : @entity276 boss @entity141 shouts out tactical instructions to his @entity8 team trip : @entity2 's @entity49 goes to ground following a tackle from @entity8 's @entity69 @entity282 @entity54 and @entity45 on the right flank were their main creative forces			1
three times the right back overlapped the composed 20 - year - old , @entity54 sending the @entity287 scurrying towards the right touchline			2
three times @entity45 failed to find a green and white shirt with his low cut - backs			2
it was the story of the night			2
a night when @entity2 looked utterly devoid of imagination , ideas or creativity			1
@entity32 threw on @entity50 , @entity257 and a fit again @entity56 in the dying stages			1
he could have thrown on @entity298 and @entity299 to no avail			0
@entity2 were beaten , flat and utterly defeated			1
away to the left of the main stand the @entity8 support bellowed their joy and defiance around an otherwise silent stadium			0
a small flurry of supporters left the main stand in the dying moments , jabbing fingers at the @entity2 directors as they went			2
how long ago @entity314 and @entity110 feels now			0
who can say where this will 6 - 1 aggregate defeat to a bang average @entity28 team will end for @entity2 now ? the sales of @entity39 and @entity320 would be the educated guess			1
@entity322 want the @entity324 keeper and there is little reason now for either side to hang around			2
for @entity2 ’s increasingly disillusioned supporters the new season can wait until the numbness subsides			2
running the line : @entity46 ( right ) fends off pressure from @entity35 during the first half heads up : @entity67 ( left ) battles with @entity2 's @entity57 in an aerial challenge foot loose : @entity8 's @entity74 ( right ) slides in on @entity2 's @entity45 to win possession @entity337 is on : @entity32 ( left ) sitting beside assistants @entity339 and @entity340 has suffered a horrendous start as @entity2 boss following the @entity344 failure to reach the group stage talk a good game : @entity8 boss @entity141 addresses the media before the match at @entity41 hoping for a comeback : @entity2 fans gather before their side 's champions league qualifier at @entity41 in full voice : @entity8 supporters were in good spirits as their team went into the clash with a 4 - 1 lead home from home : with @entity362 out of use due to the @entity364 , @entity41 hosted the qualifier			1

@entity2 knocked out of the @entity23 in third qualifying round
hoops lost 6 - 1 on aggregate following 2 - 0 defeat at @entity41
@entity32 's side went into home clash having trailed 4 - 1 from the first leg
@entity35 gave @entity28 champions lead in 36th minute
@entity74 doubled advantage on night 16 minutes after half - time
@entity383 champions now drop into @entity384 play - off round
