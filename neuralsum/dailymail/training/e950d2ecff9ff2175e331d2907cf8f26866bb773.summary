by @entity0 the attention of people around the world was centred on @entity4 winning the @entity6 @entity5 , but @entity8 's intrigue involved a @entity10 boffin with an @entity12 pencil			2
as so often , the real stories occur off the track			0
so it is in the case of @entity17 , @entity18 's peerless designer , whose services are being sought by @entity20			1
@entity17 is thought to earn Â£ 7million a year at @entity18 , meaning that to sign him @entity20 's president @entity21 would need to be the man that broke the bank at @entity25			1
that is something he would be willing to do			0
in demand : @entity20 are courting @entity18 's technical chief @entity17 in a bid to revive their fortunes the @entity33 team are in an awful mess - one of their cars was lapped in @entity36 on sunday - and the flamboyant @entity37 is personally involved in sorting out the mess			1
he has already parted company with @entity40 as team principal and replaced him with @entity42 , an executive from @entity43 who has extremely limited sporting experience			1
there will be further changes throughout the team - ' we need defenders and midfielders , not just strikers , ' as one respected @entity20 executive confessed - but the significance of signing @entity17 can hardly be overstated			1
he is , after all , the man behind 10 drivers ' and 10 constructors ' titles with @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity18			1
out of sorts : @entity20 's @entity60 was lapped during sunday 's @entity6 @entity5 but would @entity17 go ? he was equivocal about the possibility when asked by @entity62			1
' i do n't know , ' he said			0
' i need to think about it			0
we 're in the middle of the season and i 'm just getting on with it			0
' asked again , he replied : ' at some point i am going to have to think about the future , but at the moment my focus is getting in front of the silver car ( the @entity75 )			0
' @entity76 , his boss at @entity18 , was firmer but not conclusive when he responded by saying : ' it is an annual thing that there is speculation about @entity17 's future but he has made his feelings clear to me about the team			1
in the pits : @entity20 chief @entity21 salutes the @entity87 faithful in @entity6 ' he has paternal feelings towards the team and he is much more involved than he has been			1
the speculation is purely that			0
you can understand why @entity20 would be looking			0
@entity17 has always enjoyed a challenge			2
' @entity17 , who still designs by hand on a sketch board , enjoys his life at @entity18 : the atmosphere is relaxed ( but highly competitive ) , with a college - like air in his design department			2
it was that freedom , plus plenty of money , that convinced him to leave @entity58 and its straitjacket approach to join the @entity105 factory and build four world championship - winning cars			0
those working practices were sold to him by @entity76 over dinner at the @entity111 restaurant on @entity113 's @entity112			0
@entity18 are struggling this year but that is down to their under - powered @entity116 engines rather than @entity17 's chassis			1
there is no sign of any strain in relations between @entity17 and his team			2
it is more a matter of whether he is tempted to take on a new , perhaps final , challenge in @entity8 at the age of 55			2
@entity20 is alluring to anyone with racing in their soul .			0

@entity17 's services are sought by @entity20 chief @entity21
@entity17 was behind a *combined* 20 titles at @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity18
@entity20 have parted company with team principal @entity40
a move to @entity20 could signal @entity17 's final challenge in @entity8
