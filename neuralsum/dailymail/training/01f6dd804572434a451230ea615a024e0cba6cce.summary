@entity0 rolled back the years with a man - of - the - match performance for @entity2 as they toppled @entity5 leaders @entity6 to gain their first win in seven matches			1
the 32 - year - old half - back looks set to end his 16 - year career with the @entity2 at the end of the season after being told he will not get a new contract but he showed he still has plenty to offer as he masterminded an impressive 19 - 12 win for his side at the @entity18			1
@entity0 , who returned to the side in place of the injured @entity21 , scored their first try and was influential throughout as lowly @entity2 maintained their recent improvement by claiming a notable scalp			0
@entity26 back the years : @entity0 inspired @entity2 to an unlikely win against the @entity5 leaders @entity6 skipper @entity29 scored his 1,000th point for his club as they battled throughout with a makeshift half - back pair but they can have no complaints over the outcome			1
saints , whose only other defeat in their last seven matches was at neighbouring @entity42 , stay top of the table courtesy of @entity45 ’ surprise home defeat by @entity46 and they also lift the @entity47 in memory of the former @entity50 full - back who played with distinction for both clubs after topping the aggregate score in the two games this season			1
saints were the liveliest team in a nervous opening quarter for both teams and took the lead when right winger @entity61 scooped up a wayward pass and wrong - footed the @entity2 defence to score his 22nd try of the season			0
@entity66 added the conversion to make it 6 - 0 but @entity2 gradually clawed their way back into the contest , largely through the efforts of @entity0			0
the former @entity73 half - back twisted and turned out of a series of attempted tackles to register his side ’s first try on 17 minutes and @entity79 levelled the scores			1
battle : @entity2 's @entity82 and @entity83 get to grips with @entity85 at the @entity18 that gave the home side just the confidence they needed , while the introduction of heavyweight forward @entity89 lifted the crowd as he tore into the @entity57 defence			2
a clean break by full - back @entity94 came to nothing but @entity2 maintained the pressure and it paid off six minutes before the break when right winger @entity99 forced his way over from dummy half close to the line and @entity104 ’s second goal made it 12 - 6			1
the half - time hooter came at a good time for @entity6 , who were a rejuventated side at the start of the second half largely through the efforts of hooker @entity112			2
@entity61 demonstrated his ever - present threat with a 50 - metre break out of defence and , although @entity94 pulled off a crucial tackle , @entity2 ’s defence was exposed out wide when loose forward @entity118 slipped out a superb pass to get skipper @entity29 over for his side ’s second try , which enabled him to reach 1,000 points for the club			2
@entity66 ’s second conversion tied the scores but that served to inject fresh enthusiasm into the home ranks			0
@entity104 missed a chance to reclaim the lead for @entity2 when he put a penalty attempt wide of the target but another probing run from @entity0 created the position from which prop @entity136 proved unstoppable from 10 metres out as he claimed his third try of the season			0
@entity104 was again off target with the goal attempt but @entity2 forced their visitors into a series of handling errors to keep them pinned inside their own half and @entity104 clinched the win with a penalty and a drop goal .			0

half - back will retire at end of this season but scored the first try in this win
@entity6 captain @entity29 scored his 1,000th point but it was *n't* enough
this was first win in seven for @entity2 and @entity57 first defeat in that period
but @entity6 stay top as @entity45 also lose surprisingly at home to @entity46
