with its rolling hills and stone bridge over a picturesque stream it seems like the perfect reason for a day trip to the @entity8 countryside			2
only visitors taking up the trip to the @entity11 , advertised by @entity13 's national tourism board , would be disappointed as the image used is actually of the @entity15 - more than 200 miles away			1
the bungle was discovered on the @entity18 website where a photograph of @entity20 from @entity21 in @entity22 was used to advertise trips from @entity24 to the @entity11 national park			1
visit @entity13 , the national tourism board , has been using a picture of the @entity15 - 250 miles away - to promote tours to the @entity11 on a website advert aimed at day trips for @entity32 visitors it has led to criticism of the large tourism board , responsible for promoting @entity13 trips worldwide , for a poor knowledge of geography			1
anyone taking up the $ 79 day trip would have found themselves at least a five hour drive away from the actual scene			0
the photograph was used to promote the day trip for visitors from @entity32			2
the description read : ' tour stops include : @entity11 - see the stunning lakes , waterfalls and peaks of this world - famous site			0
' @entity54 describes @entity21 as ' the most photographed packhorse bridge in the @entity15 '			2
@entity56 , @entity57 's pr manager , said : ' it 's flattering that @entity18 have used @entity59 , @entity21 , to portray the @entity8 countryside , after all the @entity15 's offering is the best in the world			1
the image of @entity21 in @entity22 is an iconic and popular image used of the @entity15 park the actual @entity11 park differs widely from the image used in the @entity18 ad of @entity22 ' i know historically the two areas were closely tied			1
perhaps we should reunite and create a greater @entity72 to assist our friends in @entity74 , especially as they do n't seem to know their geography			0
' hotelier @entity76 , president of the @entity77 , added : ' this is what happens when you have a @entity81 in charge of @entity72 tourism - congratulations to @entity84 for getting into the psyche of @entity8 tourism			0
