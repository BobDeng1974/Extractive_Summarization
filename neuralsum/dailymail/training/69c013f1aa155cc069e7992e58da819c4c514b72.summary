by @entity0 published : 09:26 est , 7 march 2013 updated : 12:48 est , 7 march 2013 an environmentalist has been forced to come back down to earth following a record - breaking 457 day treetop protest after the forest she was trying to protect was threatened by a bushfire			2
@entity7 , 31 , climbed down from the 100ft tall , 400 - year - old eucalyptus tree in @entity9 to a hero 's welcome , as the fire raged just two kilometres away			1
so long was her stay on a platform in the tree in the @entity14 , 60 miles north west of @entity15 , that she had missed a close friend of hers becoming pregnant and having the baby			1
‘ it was a difficult decision to evacuate , but necessary , ’ she said , fighting back tears			0
‘ the fire is only about two kilometres from where i am so it ’s quite close and potentially a high level of risk if it comes this way			0
’ her sit - in was an @entity42 record for a tree protest , which started when she and her conservation group @entity44 learned ancient trees in the valley were due to be felled by logging companies			1
smoke rises in the background from the approaching bush fire as protestor @entity7 prepares to come back down to earth after her record - breaking protest ms @entity7 abseils back down to earth after spending well over a year protesting in the 100ft tall gum tree last december she celebrated a year in the 400 - year - old gum tree in a campaign that generated world - wide attention			1
she used modern technology – a solar - powered laptop and phone – to send her conservation message into classrooms , boardrooms and lounge rooms across the world			1
in an earlier interview with the @entity70 newspaper of @entity15 as she marked a year sitting in the tree , she said she did not know what to expect when she first hauled herself up to her treetop home , erected under canvas			2
‘ i do n’t think i would have expected to be up here for a whole year – i really hoped there would be that protection ( of trees ) in place before now			0
’ coming to terms with isolation and coping with @entity83 ’s harsh winter weather were her biggest challenges , she said			2
‘ a friend of mine fell pregnant and has had a baby since i was in the tree and i did n’t get to be part of that , ’ said the former teacher			0
ms @entity7 gets a hug from a well - wisher after touching down on the forest floor she pointed out that a lot of people did n’t know about the threat to @entity83 ’s forests and she had received a large number of emails thanking her for making the world aware			2
among those congratulating miss @entity7 for her @entity42 record - breaking sit - in was former @entity104 leader @entity103 who told her as her feet touched the ground : ‘ you ’re our hero of the forests ’			1
she has yet to say whether she will return to the tree top once the fire threat has passed			0
but friends said that whatever her decision is , she will continue to press the government to push through a @entity116 listing for the @entity14 as well as the @entity118 and @entity119 forests			0
her sit - in beat the previous - longest tree - top protest in @entity42 , set by @entity121 who sat in a tree in north @entity124 for 208 days in 1995			1
the world ’s longest record was set in the @entity127 between 1997 and 1999 when @entity128 sat in a 180ft - tall @entity130 tree for 738 days to prevent loggers cutting it down			0
her protest was successful .			0
