@entity0 is unrepentant about the cleavage baring selfies she posts on twitter the @entity4 have a rather charming phrase for a woman with a seriously impressive chest			1
she has , they say ‘ beaucoup de conversation ’ – plenty to say for herself			2
and @entity14 ’s most famous local councillor , mp ’s wife @entity0 , does indeed have plenty to say for herself , both literally and in the @entity18 sense			1
today , her famous bust is like a @entity20 ; large , rigid , and heading skywards			1
it ’s encased in a @entity23 bra but i think she ’s bigger than that , way bigger			2
‘ i have n’t had myself measured			2
i stick with an e because those bigger sizes , the @entity28 ... ’ she drops her voice conspiratorially			2
‘ they ’re scary , right ? ’ her bosoms are more familiar to her thousands of @entity3 followers in a state of deshabille in a low - cut dress , vest - top or bikini			1
her passion for selfies has seen her post a summer ’s worth of pictures , which have made her – or rather her deep , caramel - coloured cleavage – an online star			1
and because @entity0 is wily and because political creatures need a high profile like they need to breathe oxygen , she ’s seized the kind of opportunity for advancement enjoyed by busty girls since @entity53 got ’ em out for @entity55 she ’s now a fully paid - up member of both the @entity56 and the @entity57			1
but is she too much of a @entity58 for us to take her seriously – and is this storm in an @entity62 the electoral strategy of a @entity64 wannabe ? i headed to @entity66 , her husband ’s constituency , to ask			1
‘ i did not think “ i ’ll post some selfies and have a publicity hit , ” ’ she tells me			2
‘ i do n’t look at myself and think , “ oooh , @entity0 , you ’re gorgeous			1
” i do n’t have the confidence or the arrogance people think i do			2
‘ i ’m not fame - hungry			1
i just take selfies going about my business like millions of others			2
the only time i show my chest off is if i ’m going out , dressed up on friday night , when i ’m not councillor @entity0 or @entity79 , i ’m just being myself			1
anyway , if i had to pick my best feature i ’d say i quite like my eyes			1
’ among those who would beg to differ are the lads ’ mags that have offered her significant amounts of money to pose topless			1
but she ’s not interested			2
‘ you ’ll not be seeing my assets on the front of a magazine any time soon			2
’ and she ’s unrepentant about the controversy she has caused			2
‘ i ’m a woman , i have boobs and if you want to talk to them you can , or you can talk to my brain			2
i ’m not a feminist who ’s furious			2
’ no , indeed , i ’d say she was thrilled and is working out how to parlay her chest ’s popularity into a proper political career			0
she half - admits as much when she says : ‘ i ’m honoured by all the support i ’ve had and i do not underestimate the benefits of it all			1
’ a classic politician ’s answer			0
@entity0 is the wife of the @entity66 mp @entity110 , whose plain - talking on issues such as immigration and whose investigation into child sex abuse and the grooming scandals in his constituency has made him a figure of influence			1
so how does he feel about it all ? a typical picture posted on @entity3 by @entity121 - for which she has been heavily criticised ‘ @entity66 has given us @entity125 , @entity126 and @entity127			1
we have a fine reputation for supporting glamour and @entity0 is a very smart - looking woman			1
besides , ’ he twinkles , ‘ i am quite happy to see her cleavage			2
why would n’t i be ? ’ not everyone has been , though			0
@entity0 was ambushed live on @entity134 ’s @entity133 last week and told by @entity135 that she was a bad role model for young women			1
former @entity138 mp @entity137 has also accused @entity0 ’s ‘ memorable mammaries ’ of cheapening the work of women in politics , labelling her @entity64 ’s ‘ most embarrassing wife ’			1
this , @entity0 attributes , to old - fashioned class war			1
mrs @entity0 ( pictured centre ) was ambushed on @entity133 last week and told she was a ' bad role model ' ‘ i still come across snobbery , ’ she says			1
‘ i face people like @entity137 who believe you should know your place in society			0
well , we ’re all different and i believe a @entity152 would speak more widely and warmly to people like me			0
i define myself as “ working - class @entity0 ” and i will never forget my roots			1
because i lead a middle - class life , some would argue than i should now be a @entity138 voter but i would never flip			0
’ she and @entity110 live with their two sons – @entity159 , four and @entity160 , six – in a modest three - bedroom bungalow			0
( no duck - house here			0
) when i arrive @entity110 is in the kitchen with a pinny protecting his pinstripes , making a vat of @entity169 stew between political appointments			0
@entity0 who , at 31 , is 16 years his junior , appears from the bedroom , with her curlers still in			1
she is also wearing a sensible cream shift dress , along with a navy jacket and pearls , and looks rather more matronly than her girlish , carefully curated selfies – she has perfected the art of the doe eye and dropped chin – would suggest			0
but the voice , the views , and the rhino hide as far as criticism is concerned , feel authentic			0
she is a devoted @entity184 , plays the violin and the piano , and makes a legendary sunday roast			0
she and @entity110 have been together seven years			0
they met after he separated from his first wife , by whom he also has two children			2
however , the pair did not divorce until @entity0 was pregnant with @entity160			1
two images for which mrs @entity0 , the wife of @entity66 mp @entity110 , has been criticised i would like to ask : ‘ so @entity0 , what first attracted you , a @entity56 activist with political ambitions , to the town ’s much - admired mp ? ’ but i ca n’t because he was n’t an mp back then and she was n’t a councillor			1
and he was only her second serious boyfriend			0
‘ i was never fussed about men , i was too independent , ’ she says			0
‘ we met – corny – at @entity206 , went for a drink and clicked			0
when i found out i was pregnant i was in shock for nine months			0
’ they married two years ago			0
@entity3 is what @entity0 does to relax			1
she ’s been on it for two years but it was a cheeky selfie of her eating a bacon sandwich after the @entity215 bacon buttie disaster which led newspapers and political gossip websites to her @entity3 feed			1
‘ i love @entity3 – it ’s a creative way of expressing who we are and what we do , ’ she says			1
‘ i do n’t plan my selfies , they ’re taken in the moment			0
i ’ve no intention of changing myself – i ’d be letting myself down			0
what you see in those photos , that ’s me			0
i ’m more than an mp ’s wife , i ’m also a businesswoman and a mum			1
’ the question is : does she want to be an mp too ? ‘ will i go down that route ? maybe in ten years ’ time			2
but i ’m not a career politician			0
i do this [ local politics in @entity66 ] because i care			1
i ’m more than capable but i have two small boys , and i ca n’t just up and leave them			0
’ ten years will give her time to mature politically because , as she admits , ‘ right now i float around in my views			0
i ’m @entity56 for ever but the party needs a firmer vision , clearer policies			0
because we are not clear , even i ca n’t tell you what i agree and disagree with ’			0
however , she goes on to demand a cap on immigration and a review of the party ’s commitment to the minimum wage			0
ten years will also give her time to post a lot more selfies			0
do i think she has the chutzpah to be an mp ? definitely			2
would i want her as mine ? no , but give her time			0
@entity0 ’s greatest political skill thus far has been reflecting herself well in the hall of mirrors that is social media			1
i prefer my politicians to be more substantial			0
and i do n’t mean in their bra size .			0

@entity66 mp wife criticised for showing cleavage in @entity3 pictures
