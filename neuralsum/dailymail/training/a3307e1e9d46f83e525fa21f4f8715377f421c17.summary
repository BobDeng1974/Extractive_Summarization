arms folded tightly to her chest , a shopper winces in alarm as she finds herself surrounded by a swarm of bees – on a busy street in @entity8			1
around 5,000 of the insects descended on a branch of @entity11 yesterday , sending passers - by scrambling for cover			1
witnesses said they could ‘ hardly see the sky ’ as the colony made a nest on the bustling high street			0
experts said it 's common for honeybees to swarm around and set up new hives at this time of year			1
the marine biology student said : ' one of my housemates pointed my car out to me and it was just surrounded by bees			1
' it ’s not something you see every day			0
i believe they are all gone now but i will definitely be checking the car before i get in it			0
' the unusual nesting places for the bees are picked by the queen bee , who lands there first and are quickly followed by her devoted colony			2
honeybees eyes are more sensitive to ultraviolet colours , which @entity61 from the @entity62 ( @entity62 ) says could be why they were attracted to the green sign and the car			1
' it is in their nature to look for bright flowers and colours			2
also when they swarm they generally hang from the branch of a tree so it is a possibility they could be attracted to the green for that reason			0
' scores of @entity79 stopped to take photographs of the unusual sight outside @entity11 , in the heart of busy central @entity8			1
@entity83 , a project manager at nearby @entity84 and a trained bee keeper , dashed over to the shop to help lead efforts to smoke the @entity89 honeybee colony out			0
scores of passersby stopped to photograph the bees as they landed on the @entity11 sign in @entity25 @entity83 , a project manager at nearby @entity84 and a trained bee keeper , dashed over to the shop to help lead efforts to smoke the @entity89 honeybee colony out mr @entity83 , who donned a white bee keeping costume and netted hat for the tricky task , said : ' we have either had a virgin queen or an old @entity103 , she has left the nest and she has brought the warm and settled on the shop front			1
' honeybees have been providing humans with honey for centuries and play an important role in the pollination process			0
but in recent years the species has come under threat and beekeepers have seen the numbers dwindle			0
it has been estimated that the number of @entity119 honeybees has halved over the last 25 years and scientists claim there are only enough to properly pollinate a quarter of the country ’s crops			0
experts have warned that the collapse of bee colonies could trigger a farming crisis , but why populations are being hit so hard has remained largely a mystery			2
it is thought populations could have plummeted as the insect ’s meadowland habitats were concreted over and their wildflower food supply killed by herbicides			0
a recent study by the @entity137 ( @entity137 ) in @entity138 , @entity139 , has added weight to the theory that even low doses of an insecticide have an adverse effect on hives			2
he said some of the bees were flying around the area ' like scouts to try to find out where the next best place to go is '			2
the colony was later safely moved across the road to @entity154 , where it will be looked after by beekeepers on top of the @entity159 's roof			2
it is not known where the bees originally came from , but a string of shops in the local area do have their own hives			1
@entity167 , operations manager at the @entity168 ( @entity169 ) , which manages the interests of businesses in the area , said trained keepers arrived quickly on the scene to deal with the situation			0
he said : ' in @entity25 there are over a dozen experienced beekeepers who have all been on an intense training course that focuses on the theory and practical training of urban beekeeping , successfully managing hives for nearly two years			1
' local beekeepers were able to respond swiftly to manage the swarm , collect them in a mobile hive and move them to a suitable location			0
our ambassadors were also on site to reassure members of the public that the bees were not distressed			2
' @entity195 , ceo of @entity169 , said local businesses kept bees to boost the area 's biodiversity			1
she said : ' with a falling national bee population , the bees in @entity25 play a key role in showing that @entity8 is a healthy , liveable city			1
' a swarm of 2,000 bees covered @entity30 's @entity32 in @entity31 the angry swarm of bees which took up residence in a @entity32 were collected using a basket @entity209 rounds up the colony of bees that made @entity30 's car their new home mrs @entity61 , from @entity62 , said : ‘ they are doing what honey bees do naturally and are not remotely interested in humans			1
' in fact before leaving their hive the bees fill up their stomachs with honey and are rather mellow ; their sole intention is to find a new home to build - up a new colony			0
' as long as the swarm is not provoked it will not do any harm but it is important that the bees are collected by an experienced beekeeper			0
' if left to their own devices they may choose to set up home in the nearest convenient spot which could be a chimney or other inaccessible place			0
' the 20,000 angry bees swarmed the car in @entity31 on thursday @entity30 , 21 , ( left ) a student at @entity240 found the bees settled in his car ( right ) she added that in central @entity8 people often keep bees on rooftops : ' the urban scene is not necessarily a paradise for bees			1
' a very high percentage of the urban area is barren bricks and mortar , concrete and tarmac and many grassy open spaces offer little of interest to bees , so forage is limited and consequently the number of hives that can be sustained limited too , ' she said			1
' another key factor when keeping bees in towns and cities is the siting of hives and their management to ensure that there is minimal nuisance to neighbours and the general public			2
' proper training in beekeeping skills is vital to be able to assess suitability of apiary sites and to be able to manage colonies to minimise swarming and the likelihood for stinging events involving the public			0

bees landed on discount sign on window of @entity11 in @entity8 's @entity25
comes as student in @entity31 found his @entity32 covered in bees too
experts say it 's common for bees to set up new hives this time of year
attraction to ultraviolet colours could be why they decided to land
