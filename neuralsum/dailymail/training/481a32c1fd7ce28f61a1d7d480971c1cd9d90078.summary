@entity5 , pictured with some of his models in 1991 , was ' a man who loved women , lots of women ' the glamorous champagne lifestyle he encouraged his models to lead was largely at odds with the prevailing business ethos at the time			1

that year , she became the world 's highest earning model			1

at its height @entity14 was earning up to $ 65 million in bookings per year			1

' i had the understanding of a guy who loved beautiful women , and above all who liked the sensuality of it all , ' he said in a 2010 video interview with the blog @entity79			0
' all of the other agents were either women or gay guys			0
they had their own approach , which in certain instances was probably superior to mine , but i had something i thought was unique			0
i looked at my models as women			0
' @entity52 was increasingly being faced accusations of engaging in relationships with underage models and resigned from his agency in 2000 following a @entity95 undercover exposé			0
the programme showed some of @entity14 ’s @entity99 agents bragging about using drugs and having sex with young models			2
he later turned bitter towards the women he helped dominate the catwalk , calling them ' spoilt pains ' surrounded by ' idiots and leeches '			2
@entity7 on the catwalk in 1990 , around the time she made the famous comment , and @entity19 , who @entity52 names a ' talentless @entity114 sausage ' he described @entity19 as a ' talentless @entity114 sausage ' and @entity9 as ' odious '			1
he said , as reported by the @entity116 : ' apart from @entity7 , no supermodel has ever thanked me when she got to the top			2
