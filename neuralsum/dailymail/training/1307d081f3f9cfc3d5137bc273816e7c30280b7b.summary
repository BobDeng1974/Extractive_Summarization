photographer @entity7 rigged ropes across canyons to capture the vertigo - inducing views as the kayakers freefall down the monster drop			1
adventure - loving trio @entity14 , @entity16 , and @entity17 spent 10 days hurtling down powerful waterfalls of up to 130ft in height on a trip to @entity21 , @entity22			1
do n't look down : photographer @entity7 rigged up ropes to capture the vertigo - inducing views @entity26 : the three kayakers with nerves of steel drop up to 65ft down huge waterfalls in @entity22 mr @entity7 , from @entity31 , @entity32 , hung within touching distance of the kayakers as they plummeted over the waters edge			1
he joined a team of filmmakers - @entity38 , @entity39 , and @entity40 - to capture the incredible views and turned the trip into a short film called ‘ @entity44 ’			1
his stunning vantage points show the heart - in - mouth views the gutsy kayakers are faced with as they freefall down the monster drops like never seen before			2
mr @entity7 said : ' the narrow , gorge - like nature of the two big rivers in @entity21 meant there were opportunities to set up a line across the canyons			1
' we did n’t expect how great it would look and with a little creativity how frequently we could pull it off			0
heart - stopping : the kayak edges over the steep waterfall towards a huge drop into the choppy pool below suspended : photographer @entity7 rigged ropes across the canyon to capture the dramatic images vantage point : the photographer hung over the rushing water to get the unique pictures @entity70 : two of the three kayakers wait in the water below as the third drops down the waterfall ' i could have touched the paddlers as they went by - we were literally dangling a few feet away from the lip of the waterfall			1
' the idea of this view , looking straight down the waterfall , was definitely one of those shots that we talked about before arriving in @entity22			2
' we were n’t the first people to shoot images in @entity21 but that became the challenge - how could we use light , perspective , and creativity to capture images that people had n’t seen anywhere before ? ' kayaking waterfalls is a one - take situation			2
even if the paddlers enter the water cleanly , it hurts , like getting punched in the face			0
' splash : the kayaker 's yellow helmet is seen through the white water as he battles through the rapids rapids : @entity16 holds the world record for plunging 186ft down the @entity107 in 2009 pain : @entity14 pictured on an @entity110 turn			2
mr @entity7 said hitting the water is like getting ' punched in the face ' @entity16 - who holds the world record plunge in a kayak off the 186ft @entity107 in 2009 - broke his back just two years ago on the @entity116 in @entity117 , @entity32			1
he said : ' breaking my back hit the reset button for me in my waterfall running			0
i had to start back at the beginning and work up			0
' this was the first time i finally felt right to run big waterfalls after over 18 months of striving to get back to that spot			0
' @entity7 and the team captured the critical moment when everything goes right or everything goes wrong during the fall			0
team : @entity40 , @entity7 , @entity16 , @entity14 , @entity39 , @entity38 , @entity17 ' it ’s important for waterfall kayakers to land precisely and that is influenced by their actions at the lip of the waterfall and into the first 20 feet of free fall			1
' at this moment i was focused on setting my angle correctly			0
some of the beauty of waterfall running is a separation from thoughts and the purity of existing in complete presence with such an amazing force of nature			0

photographer @entity7 hung over the canyons to get the incredible shots
