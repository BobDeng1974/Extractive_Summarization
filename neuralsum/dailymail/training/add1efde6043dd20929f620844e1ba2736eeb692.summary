the teenager with her mother @entity55 : instead of producing adrenalin to cope with stress , @entity11 's body reacts by shutting down her vital organs @entity27 's affects around one in every 15,000 people and is caused by a lack of steroid hormones in the body			1
these are normally produced by the adrenal gland , but damage can cause levels to drop			0
the disease is normally caused by the body 's own immune system turning on the adrenal gland , but cancer and tuberculosis can also trigger the condition			1
the impact on the body can be significant			0
one steroid , called cortisol , is involved in controlling how much water there is in the body as well as helping to fight inflammation			0
another , aldosterone , regulates salt and water levels and blood pressure			0
