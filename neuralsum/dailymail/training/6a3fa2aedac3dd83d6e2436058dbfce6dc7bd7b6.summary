by @entity0 published : 21:17 est , 3 april 2013 updated : 07:49 est , 4 april 2013 @entity1 have complained that rules around dinner expenses are not generous enough , they do not get as big a meal allowance as soldiers and that they can not claim for ' a large lunch at lunchtime '			1
@entity9 mp @entity8 said it is ' ludicrous ' that mps from outside of @entity12 have to wait until 7.30pm to claim for an evening meal when they are required to be at the @entity14 for late sittings			1
at a @entity14 administration committee hearing , @entity17 , a shadow @entity9 defence minister and mp for @entity21 , said that mps are only given £ 15 a night towards their evening meals while civil servants get about £ 24			1
@entity25 mp sir @entity24 , left , and @entity9 mp @entity8 , right , brought up the cost of @entity1 meals at a @entity14 administration committee hearing he claimed a colleague told him that serving soldiers receive a £ 29 allowance , but the @entity32 told the @entity33 that soldiers get £ 25 to cover all three meals if they are away from their base on a course			1
@entity1 earn at least £ 65,738 , with extra money for ministerial roles			2
mr @entity8 , mp for @entity41 and @entity42 , asked the @entity44 's policy director @entity43 to consider letting mps have a subsistence allowance			0
mr @entity17 said he ' might choose to have a large lunch at lunchtime ' , but he is not allowed to claim it back			1
he said : ' i never claim the £ 15 full amount , but what you have now stopped doing , which i can not quite understand , is if , for example , i choose at lunchtime to have a meal and then have a snack in the evening , you will not pay for the one at lunchtime			1
' you will perhaps pay for the snack in the evening , even if it all comes to less than £ 15			2
' administration committee chair sir @entity24 , the @entity25 mp for @entity62 , said : ' some declared in their election manifestos that they would not claim for the overnight cost of eating when they were away			0
mr @entity8 said it was ' ludicrous ' that mps that are not from @entity12 have to wait until after 7.30pm for an evening meal if they are to claim it back when the @entity14 sits late ' if you are a businessman away you would normally get remunerated for the actual costs			1
for those that have come down from distant places , they are here for three nights probably , in which case they eat more than one meal a day			0
' it would be helpful to some new aspiring members not to find themselves trapped into declarations , which then , when they get here , they find are very uncomfortable			0
' mr @entity8 told the @entity33 : ' i have no problem with the receipts or with the figure of £ 15			2
my point is that it ’s ludicrous that the test that is applied is the @entity98 sitting at 7.31pm			0
that in itself is not the only measure of what mps are doing			0
' mr @entity17 told the newspaper : ' things like the subsistence allowance seem very arbitrary in the way they are being implemented			0
what we need to do is simplify the system to make it less bureaucratic for claiming and cheaper for the taxpayer			0

' ludicrous ' that @entity1 must wait until 7.30pm to claim a meal
members get a £ 15 a night allowance when the @entity14 is in a late sitting
@entity61 complains he can not claim for ' a large lunch ' but can for evening snacks
