@entity0 is set to mount a challenge to @entity2 in the race for peak performance			2
but do n't expect to pay @entity6 prices for the stupendous new gt — it 's predicted to sell for a cool quarter of a million pounds			1
that 'll buy you up to a dozen @entity13 saloons or nearly 30 ka superminis			2
the two - seater , designed by @entity15 , younger brother of @entity17 design director @entity16 , was unveiled at the @entity18 ahead of going into production			1
the new @entity20 ( pictured ) was introduced at the @entity18 in @entity21 this january the rear - engined supercar features upwardly swinging scissor doors , 20in alloy wheels and raised twin exhausts			1
it 's tipped to compete at @entity27 next year , which is apt as it 's the 50th anniversary of @entity0 's original gt beating @entity2 's six year winning streak at the race			1
at its heart is a 600bhp 3.5 - litre twin - turbo @entity35 engine linked to a sporty seven - speed dual clutch transmission			1
a teardrop - shaped cabin reduces wind resistance and the driver and passenger are cocooned in a super-strong carbon - fibre cell			1
the rear spoiler can deploy automatically to help keep the car rooted to the ground			1
fierce stopping power is provided by carbon - ceramic brakes			1
mr @entity15 told @entity49 magazine : ' we wanted people to recognise it as a @entity20 , but did n't want to do the heritage car we 've done in the past			1
' i 'm still pinching myself that we got to do it			0
that we knew it was going to be a production car helped			0
i think the danger was going off in flights of fancy			0
but it really kept us grounded			0
' @entity62 , @entity0 's vice-president for global product development , said : ' the gt is the ultimate execution of an enthusiast supercar			1
it includes innovations and technologies that can be applied across our future portfolio			0
' away from the @entity73 hype , @entity71 's biggest - selling marque for the 38th consecutive year celebrated a double win			1
the @entity13 was crowned estate car of the year in the @entity76 ? awards after only its first full month on sale			1
and the @entity79 was best hot hatch for the second year running			1
what car ? singled out the @entity83 estate , capable of more than 74mpg			0
it 's priced at £ 23,045 , comes with @entity86 connectivity and 8in touchscreen as standard , plus cruise control , @entity89 and a rear seat ski hatch			1
editor @entity91 said : ' it 's hard to find an estate car that excels in every single area , yet @entity0 has got it spot on with the new @entity13			0
just like the old car , it 's fantastic to drive , with a refined engine and a smooth ride			0
' it 's cracking value and will be cheaper to run than most of its rivals , thanks to co2 emissions of just 99g/km			0
' @entity105 , from £ 17,395 , was praised for its ' dynamic yet practical ' style , high performance and value			0
an all - new @entity109 seven - seater will go on sale in the summer along with a new @entity111 , @entity112 , @entity113 and @entity114			1
the new @entity115 will also go into production this year			2
if owning one of the last @entity120 to be produced still is n't exclusive enough for you , a @entity118 - based company is offering what it calls the ' ultimate defender			2
' the model dates back to 1948			2
these , the final batch , are special editions ranging from £ 27,800 to £ 61,845			0
but modification specialist @entity127 has pumped and pimped up the basic version to produce a 4x4 with near - supercar performance — and a £ 150,000 price - tag to match			1
its @entity134 105 @entity133 is an elongated defender with a 450 bhp 6.2 - litre @entity137 petrol engine			2
it will be unveiled at the @entity139 this spring			2
cheeky little @entity140 is putting a large amount of oomph into its new @entity144 crossover that had its @entity71 debut party in @entity146 this week			0
a risqué promo film , shot in @entity148 , has already become an internet sensation			0
it features a man of advancing years who , with amorous intent in mind , loses his little blue pill out of the window			0
it bounces around the ancient hilltop town — narrowly missing an open - mouthed priest — until it lands in the tank of a young chap 's standard @entity140 500 , which instantly morphs into the bigger , testosterone - charged @entity162 as he fills it with petrol			2
@entity164 attends the @entity144 event this week , where @entity166 performaned , at the @entity167 , @entity168 , @entity146 the film was quite the talk of the event at the @entity167 , at the @entity172 in @entity173 , this week , which also featured magician @entity166 and guests including @entity164 ( pictured with the car )			0
@entity140 is holding a nationwide promotional tour and more than 71,000 potential customers have already registered an interest			0
