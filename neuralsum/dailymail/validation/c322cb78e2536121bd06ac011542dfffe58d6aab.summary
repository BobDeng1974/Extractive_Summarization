@entity2 's long - term plan to abolish the airport passenger duty tax completely could significantly harm @entity6 's already suffering smaller airports , revealed a report from @entity8			1
a report from the @entity10 said the success of the @entity13 's smaller airports are being held back by the existence of the @entity4 , one of the world 's heftiest departure taxes			1
the @entity8 said that @entity18 was suffering in terms of jobs , growth and connectivity as aviation taxes were higher than in the @entity24			0
and when @entity4 is charged at both ends of a trip the tax ' incentivises airlines and passengers to fly from airports located in other @entity32 member states ' , said the mp 's report			1
the @entity36 's plans to abolish the airport passenger duty could harm @entity6 's airports the @entity36 wants to reduce @entity4 by 50 per cent in the next term of the @entity40 and eventually get rid of it altogether in a bid to win the country 's airports a ' competitive advantage '			1
however , there is no such commitment to axing @entity4 in the rest of the @entity13 , despite a decision by the chancellor to abolish @entity4 payments on children 's tickets back in december			1
a spokesman for the campaign @entity55 , @entity56 , welcomed the report and called on the rest of the @entity13 to follow @entity2 's lead			1
' we welcome the @entity61 's report highlighting the detrimental effect that @entity4 has on smaller airports , and the @entity61 's recognition that a lower level of @entity4 in @entity2 will have a negative effect on the rest of the @entity13 , ' mr @entity56 said			1
' with @entity13 passengers currently paying one of the highest rates of tax on flying anywhere in the world , it is not surprising that the @entity36 is committed to cutting this damaging tax			2
however , a cut in @entity4 in @entity2 needs to be matched by a cut in @entity4 across the rest of the @entity13 , so that no part of the country is disadvantaged in any way			1
' a report from the @entity10 said the success of the @entity13 's smaller airports are being held back by the departure tax , which is one of the largest in the world the report warned that if @entity4 is scrapped in @entity2 - the wheels are already in motion with the tax being devolved to @entity91 - ' airports in @entity6 would be subject to a similar competitive disadvantage to that currently experienced in @entity18 '			1
£ 26 per ticket to @entity95 £ 69 per ticket to @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity99 and @entity100 £ 97 per ticket to @entity102 , @entity103 and @entity104 the abolition of the tax at @entity91 would bring £ 1billion into the economy by 2020 along with almost 4,000 jobs , according to a report commissioned by @entity110			0
plans to exempt children from @entity4 , announced in the autumn statement of 2014 , was ' a marginal change which did nothing for business travellers and little for smaller airports ' , the report added			1
the committee said : ' we found that @entity4 is the principal threat to the smaller airports sector			2
' @entity4 can not be amended to support people , businesses and regional economies because of the operation of @entity95 competition law , while proposals to devolve it to the regions would serve only to spread a patchwork of market distortions across the @entity13			0
' the report covered around 40 smaller airports ranging in size from @entity135 , which handled 4.4 million passengers in 2013 , to @entity137 in @entity138 which handled 1,000 launching the report today the committee 's chairwoman @entity139 said : ' smaller airports drive economic growth			2
but the smaller airports sector - which is vital to people and businesses in the regions - is limited by @entity4			1
transport ministers must stand up for smaller airports and make the case to the @entity150 that @entity4 squeezes jobs , growth and connectivity			2
' she added : ' the whole country should share the economic benefits of expanded airport capacity			0
but that will only happen if new capacity includes new domestic flights to airports outside @entity162			0
' the @entity163 needs to take a proactive approach and ensure that the regions are connected			0
' @entity2 's transport minister @entity166 told @entity169 @entity2 's @entity168 programme found validation in the report and said they would do what was best for their airports			2
' it does somewhat validate what we 've been saying - that reducing air passenger duty would create economic growth in terms of more routes and sustain the lines that we have at the moment , ' he said			0
' that 's why airports and the airlines have called within @entity2 for the power to be transferred to us so that we can be more adept			0
@entity2 's transport minister @entity166 said did n't mind that ' other parts of the @entity13 may well be nervous but if we have the power then we 'll use it to put @entity2 at a competitive advantage ' ' some other parts of the @entity13 may well be nervous but if we have the power then we 'll use it to put @entity2 at a competitive advantage			0

@entity201 chief executive @entity200 said : ' the past few years have been tough for many of our smaller members			0
' reducing apd is the single biggest thing that could enable airports to attract new routes and increase their passenger numbers			0
@entity4 is the highest aviation tax in the world and is increasingly putting the @entity13 at a disadvantage			2
' a @entity163 spokesman said : ' regional airports make a vital contribution to the @entity13 economy by boosting local jobs and providing important domestic and international connectivity			0
we want to help these airports thrive as part of our long - term economic plan , which is why we launched the @entity222 to support more new air routes			1
' we are now assessing bids from airports and airlines for this funding and will soon announce a short list of routes , with a final announcement over the summer			0
' we welcome the publication of the committee 's report on smaller airports and we will study their conclusions carefully before responding in due course			1
