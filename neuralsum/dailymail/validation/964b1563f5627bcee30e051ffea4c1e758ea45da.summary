the chameleon ’s ability to change colour and blend into the background is famous			1
now engineers have created artificial ‘ skin ’ that could one day be used to make soldiers ’ uniforms and give them the same ability as the colourful reptile			2
the incredibly thin camouflage material can be made to change colour on demand , by bending it			1
engineers have created artificial ‘ skin ’ that could one day be used to make soldiers ’ uniforms , giving them the ability to blend into their surroundings like a chameleon researchers say the new material offers intriguing possibilities for an entirely new class of display technologies , colour - shifting camouflage , and sensors that could detect otherwise imperceptible defects in buildings , bridges and aircraft			1
‘ this is the first time anybody has made a flexible chameleon - like skin that can change colour simply by flexing it , ’ said professor @entity29 , a member of the @entity31 team that developed the material			1
they made the material by etching features smaller than a wavelength of light onto a silicon film one thousand times thinner than a human hair			1
the markings enabled them to select the range of colours the material would reflect , depending on how it was flexed and bent			2
engineers made the material ( illustrated ) by etching features smaller than a wavelength of light onto a silicon film one thousand times thinner than a human hair the incredibly thin camouflage material can be made to change colour on demand like a chameleon ( stock image ) , by applying a minimal amount of force chameleons appear to be capable of rearranging crystals inside specialised skin cells to switch hues in order to attract a potential mate or scare off a rival			1
the process involves the active tuning of a lattice of microscopic crystals in skin cells called iridophores			0
not only do the crystals allow the lizard to shift rapidly from efficient camouflage and spectacular mating displays , but they also protect it from overheating			2
it was previously thought that coloured pigments were gathered and dispersed inside different cells			0
the colours we see in paints and fabrics , for example , occur when white broad spectrum light strikes their surfaces			0
the unique chemical composition of each surface then absorbs various bands , or wavelengths of light			0
bands that are n’t absorbed are reflected back , with shorter wavelengths giving objects a blue hue and longer wavelengths appearing redder , with a rainbow of possible combinations in between			0
while autumn leaves change colour because of a shift in their chemical make - up , the researchers say they can transform the shade of their material by controlling the surface features on the tiniest of scales so they interact and reflect particular wavelengths of light			1
professor @entity114 said that such ‘ structural colour ’ is much less common in nature , but is used by some butterflies and beetles to create a an iridescent display			2
to make the material , the @entity31 team etched rows of ridges onto a thin layer of silicon , which was set into a layer of silicone for flexibility			1
rather than spreading the light into a complete rainbow , the ridges reflect a specific wavelength of light			0
other applications for the new material include new types of advertising boards , active camouflage coatings for cars and sensors that could chnage colour to indicate structural fatigue in bridges , for example			1
a stock image of @entity146 in @entity147 is shown by ‘ tuning ’ the spaces between the ridges , professor @entity114 said it is possible to select the specific colour to be reflected			2
they realised it would be possible to subtly shift the spaces between the ridges , and therefore the colour , by flexing or bending the material			2
as the silicone is bent or flexed , the gaps between the ridges respond			0
professor @entity114 said : ‘ if you have a surface with very precise structures , spaced so they can interact with a specific wavelength of light , you can change its properties and how it interacts with light by changing its dimensions			0
’ the study , published in the journal @entity172 , says the material is easy to manufacture with the desired surface properties and is able to reflect very pure colours , reflecting up to 83 per cent of the incoming light			0
so far the experts have created a piece of material that ’s one square centimetre , so more time and research is needed before clothes can be created , for example			0
professor @entity114 said : ‘ the next step is to make this larger - scale and there are facilities already that could do so			0
‘ at that point , we hope to be able to find applications in entertainment , security , and monitoring			0
’ she said the chameleon material to make a new type of billboard as well as create an active camouflage on the exterior of vehicles that would change colour to better match the surrounding environment			1
it could also be used to make sensors that would change colour to indicate that structural fatigue was stressing critical components on bridges , buildings , or the wings of airplanes			1
‘ this is the first time anyone has achieved such a broad range of colour on a one - layer , thin and flexible surface			1
i think it ’s extremely cool , ’ she said .			0

engineers from the @entity31 made the thin material
it can be made to change colour on demand , by applying force
this is possible because of tiny etchings on incredibly thin silicon
it could one day be used for a new type of display boards , colour - shifting camouflage and sensors to show defects in buildings and bridges
