dozens of military personnel were injured when an @entity3 transport plane on its way to @entity6 nose - dived 4,400ft after the captain 's camera became lodged alongside the aircraft 's joystick			1
the @entity12 jet was around five hours into its journey from @entity14 to @entity15 when the @entity17 camera , used by the captain to take photographs on board , got stuck between the arm rest and the side - stick controller when his seat moved forward			1
in 27 seconds of chaos , the plane lost 4,400ft in altitude , throwing passengers and crew without seatbelts towards the ceiling , injuring 33 of those on board , while one traumatised passenger was hospitalised with stress , according to the report into the incident			1
this reconstruction shows how an @entity3 captain 's camera became wedged alongside a @entity12 aircraft 's joystick before it plunged 4,400ft in mid air , injurying dozens of military personnel on board the @entity12 jet , similar to the one pictured , had been six hours into its journey from @entity14 to @entity15 when the @entity17 camera , used to take photographs on board , got stuck in the flight controls the new @entity12 jet had been six hours into its journey from @entity14 to @entity15 when the captain 's @entity48 , used to take photographs on board , got stuck in the flight controls the aircraft , a militarised version of the @entity55 passenger jet , was diverted to an airbase in @entity57 after the incident on february 9 last year , and the state - of - the - art fleet grounded for 11 days while the cause of the dive was investigated by the @entity62			1
the final report into the incident , released last week , has now revealed that @entity3 captain had been alone in the cockpit and was taking pictures of the flight deck from his seat with the digital slr camera in the three minutes before the plane dramatically plummeted			2
the camera had been between his arm rest and the side - stick unit which controls the aircraft 's altitude , and became wedged in when his seat moved forward			2
the report author describes the incident as a ' near - miss ' and said there was a ' realistic potential for the loss of the aircraft and 198 of our people '			1
there were nine crew members and 189 servicemen and women on board the flight , who had been served their meal and were enjoying the in - flight entertainment when when the plane suddenly lost altitude while cruising at 33,000ft over the @entity96 on its way to the main @entity100 base in @entity6			1
the digital slr camera , used by the captain in the three minutes before the plunge , had become wedged between his arm rest and the side - stick unit which control 's the aircraft 's altitude , when his seat moved forward , as this reconstruction shows at its fastest , it dropped at a rate of 15,800 feet per minute with the resulting g force enough to lift passengers out of their seats , as their belongings and other items such as pots of hot tea were hurled across the cabin			1
' a large number of passengers and crew had been thrown towards the ceiling , ' the report states			1
' a significant volume of loose articles , including bags , personal effects , teapots , paper cups and bins were flying around the cabin while some passengers were shouting			1
' according to the report , at the time of the plunge , the co-pilot had been out of the cockpit and was among those thrown towards the roof			2
' immediately prior to the pitch - down , the co-pilot felt a sensation similar to turbulence			0
the @entity144 also reported a similar sensation , describing it as a " jolt " , it states			0
' as the aircraft pitched down , the co-pilot was lifted to the cabin roof and , while experiencing weightlessness , re-entered the flight deck through the open door			2
' he described a confusing scene with audio alarms sounding and a violent shaking of the aircraft			0
' the captain shouted repeatedly that he could not disengage the autopilot			0
with his feet on the flight deck roof , the co-pilot reached down and attempted to disengage the autopilot by pulling back on his side - stick ; an action which appeared to have no effect			2
' the two pilots were quickly able to level the plane , and the captain decided to land the air craft as soon as possible so diverted the flight to the @entity172 's @entity171 in southern @entity57			1
of those on board , 25 passengers and seven crew members were injured , and were cared for by medical personnel travelling as passengers , as well as by medics at @entity179			1
this dotted line shows the dent in the camera , caused when it became wedged next to the side - stick the dent in the camera was found to be consistent with having been caused by the flange of the side - stick the report states that one passenger had an ' acute stress rection ' and was administered oxygen by a doctor before being taken to hospital upon landing			2
a cabin crew member was also hyperventilating but was cared for by a colleague			1
passengers without @entity197 travel orders then had to stump up £ 10 in cash for a visa allowing them to pass through immigration , with the servicemen and women having to club together to buy the visas as the @entity100 @entity205 was unable to transfer the money			1
mental health experts were sent out to @entity179 to help ensure that the passengers felt able to get back on a plane so they could be taken back to the @entity100 , and assess whether they were fit to be deployed to @entity6			1
but by the time they were flown back to @entity100 , two days after the terrifying plunge , ' several passengers were exhibiting signs of distress , with some requiring counselling from the mental health nurses or medication from the @entity14 medical staff			1
' ten passengers were told they were no longer required to deploy to @entity6 , while a further 12 did not have to for medical or pastoral reasons			0
damage to the aircraft included 50 broken in - flight entertainment sockets , seven dented ceiling panels , five broken florescent light tubes and five damaged hand rails , but there was no reported damage to the flight deck , and no reported damage to the external structure of the aircraft			0
the cost of the incident has not yet been calculated , although an early estimate put it in the region of £ 0.5million			0
the report found that the pilot had taken 77 photographs during the flight and had used it as recently as three minutes and 20 seconds before the incident			0
the plane had set off from @entity14 in @entity245 ( pictured ) on the morning of february 9 last year the flight had been bound for @entity15 in @entity6 ( pictured ) , which was the @entity100 's major base in the country until late last year it states that although using the camera during the flight was not prohibited , its use ' represented a lack of compliance with the policy regarding non-relevant duties '			1
however , it also says that during the cruise stage of the flight the pilot 's workload would have been low , and that taking photographs would have been a way for the captain to maintain his alertness			0
it recommends that ways of minimising pilot boredom during less busy periods of the flight should be examined			2
changes to the design of the cabin to prevent a similar incident were not required , but the report recommends that strengthening rules regarding wearing seatbelts could mitigate ' future in - flight upsets '			1
the report concludes : ' the loss of the aircraft was not an unrealistic possibility			2
while at its heart this incident was caused by the simple and unthinking act of placing a loose article close to the aircraft controls , there are broader lessons to learn here			0
' modern technology may be capable of reducing crew workload to historic lows and aircraft can now protect themselves as never before , but the requirement for crews to understand and interact with the aircraft and its systems when things deviate from the norm remains and challenging as ever			0
' an @entity3 spokesman said : ‘ the safety of our passengers and crew is of paramount importance to us			0
' the incident was caused by a camera becoming lodged between the arm rest and side - stick causing the aircraft to lose height , the @entity3 is in the process of implementing the recommendations made by the @entity313 including instructions to ensure no objects are placed between pilots ’ arm rests and the side stick ’			2
a spokesman for @entity320 , which is responsible for the supply of @entity12 to the @entity3 and the service which underpins it , told @entity324 : ' as an operational issue for the @entity3 , it would be inappropriate for @entity320 to comment			0
' however , we note the findings of the @entity329 , which confirm that no technical fault was found with the aircraft			0
' the @entity3 started using the @entity12 's last year after agreeing to bring in 14 of the planes for military use under a @entity335 ( @entity335 ) contract that is costing more than £ 10bn			2
they were intended to replace the @entity3 's @entity337 and @entity338 planes both as a transport plane , and as an air - to - air refuelling tanker			0
the @entity341 bought a fleet of 14 @entity343 last year under a £ 10.5bn private finance initiative deal with @entity245 - based @entity320			0
the aircraft – a military version of the @entity55 civilian jet – can fly at a top speed of @entity12 can transport 400 soldiers			1
twice the size of a @entity353 bomber , with a 197ft 10in wingspan and is 193ft in length , the planes can hold 100,000 litres of fuel and are the biggest the @entity3 has ever had			0
in theory , they can refuel jets in mid-air at 125 times the speed of forecourt garage pumps – at 5,000 litres a minute			0
an @entity363 is pictured as it flies out out of @entity364 in @entity365			0

@entity12 jet with 9 crew and 189 military personnel flying to @entity15
33 people were injured and many more traumatised in ' near - miss '
as plane plummeted teapots , cups and bins thrown around cabin
crew members experienced weightlessness *due* to g force from fall
plane forced to land in @entity57 and passengers had to *pay* £ 10 for visas
they were then brought back to the @entity100 but many were *afraid* to fly
report recommends ways of managing pilots ' boredom are investigated
it states ' realistic potential for the loss of the aircraft and 198 people '
