his nine - year career at @entity2 has been an emotional and physical roller coaster			1
often showing glimpses that he is the perfect mix of power and guile his manager craves before spending weeks , or even years , in the treatment room , @entity10 now looks set to release this @entity12 midfielder at the end of his contract in june			1
the ride is coming to an end			0
1554 days , 222 weeks , over four years out injured			2
the numbers are n't as pretty as his playing style can be			0
this is the curious case of @entity21			0
@entity22 poses with @entity2 manager @entity10 upon his signing in january 2006 @entity22 challenges @entity25 's @entity24 ( c ) during a 1 - 1 draw at @entity27 in 2006 @entity22 sits on the first of the 60,000 seats to be installed at the @entity30 before @entity2 moved in @entity22 beats @entity32 's @entity31 ( right ) during a match at the @entity34 in may 2006 3339 days at club 1554 days injured 46.5 % injured when @entity22 arrived in the @entity36 on january 13 , 2006 , @entity2 beat off competition from @entity38 and @entity39 to sign the 19 - year - old from @entity41			1
comparisons were already drawn to club legend and former captain @entity44 because of his height , intensity and technique on the ball			2
' @entity22 is a bit more offensive than @entity44 but when he plays a more defensive role he is very similar , ' @entity10 said			1
he started off well , scoring his first goal for the @entity52 in april against @entity53 , but his debut half - season in north @entity55 ended in despair			0
@entity22 was the victim of an ' assassins tackle ' from @entity32 youngster @entity58 - according to @entity10 - his sickening scream as he fractured his ankle at the @entity34 must still be heard by the boss			1
all 42 of @entity22 's injuries since he joined @entity2 in january 2006 @entity22 battles with @entity64 's @entity63 during their @entity67 semi-final second leg at the @entity30 in january 2007			1
@entity2 won the tie 5 - 3 on aggregate @entity22 tussles with @entity38 's @entity70 ( left ) during the @entity67 final in february 2007			1
@entity38 won the game 2 - 1 at the @entity73 in @entity74 @entity22 kicked @entity38 captain @entity75 in the face during the final in 2007 @entity78 of @entity79 battles with @entity2 trio @entity80 , @entity81 and @entity82 during a league match at @entity84 in march 2007			1
@entity79 won the game 1 - 0 a bandaged @entity22 under pressure from @entity88 's @entity87 ( right ) during @entity2 's 3 - 1 win at the @entity30 in the league in april 2007 @entity2 have played in 350 league games since about @entity22 signed			1
he has featured in 124 of them or 35 % , one every 15.7 days			0
league games by season : 2005/06 : 12 , 2006 - 07 : 12 , 2007 - 08 : 15 , 2008 - 09 : 24 , 2009 - 10 : 29 , 2010/11 : 16 , 2011 - 12 : 4 , 2012 - 13 11 , 2013 - 14 1 , 2014 - 15 : 0 put simply , the 28 - year - old has never recovered			0
whether it be a calf muscle or a hamstring , an abdominal strain or a cruciate ligament , @entity22 's talent looks set to be wasted			2
he has clocked up 42 injuries during his @entity2 career , according to data from physioroom , averaging a new setback every 80 days			1
the @entity52 have played 350 league games since his arrival but @entity22 has featured in just 35 per cent of them			2
despite his struggles , his almost constant spell on the sidelines has n't been short of its positive moments			0
in early 2012 @entity112 came back into the @entity2 team to feature alongside @entity114 and @entity115 and impressed , even scoring on his return to the @entity12 national team			2
@entity10 heralded his fellow countryman as a holding midfielder when he made his one and only performance this season , a slack display against @entity123 in a @entity67 defeat			2
@entity22 is embraced by team - mates @entity126 ( left ) and @entity127 ( centre ) during @entity2 's 3 - 2 win at @entity130 during the @entity67 quarter - final in december 2007 @entity22 dives in to challenge @entity133 striker @entity132 during the @entity135 semi-final at @entity136 in april 2009 @entity22 scores past @entity138 goalkeeper @entity137 during the @entity140 clash at the @entity30 in november 2009 the @entity2 midfielder scores a header past @entity144 goalkeeper @entity143 in february 2010 as recently as november , the @entity52 ' boss was insistent that @entity22 would be offered his new contract if he were to prove his health			1
' if he comes back , i will keep him			0
i always believed in him			0
in football , the most important thing is health			0
' but @entity22 has n't come close to featuring since , and given the wealth of midfield options @entity10 has available it is extremely unlikely he will ever don the @entity2 shirt again , even if he were to return to fitness			1
he is the second longest - serving player at the club behind @entity158 , and is a much - loved figure in the dressing room			0
his emotional pull remains strong with the fans , who would love for him to be the midfield destroyer and box - to - box runner he has shown he can be			0
@entity22 vies for the ball with @entity167 star @entity166 during the @entity135 quarter - final at the @entity30 in march 2010 @entity22 battles with @entity144 midfielder @entity169 ( left ) during a 1 - 1 draw at @entity171 in august 2010 @entity22 appeared on the final day of last season for @entity2 away at @entity173 in his most recent @entity36 appearance for the club			1
it was also his only appearance last season however , this is n't a perfect world and head must rule over heart , especially at a club vying for the top places			0
@entity22 has played one @entity36 game in his last two years , and @entity2 have backed the player admirably			1
but as the midfielder looks to get back to full strength once again , wherever that may be , this quote by @entity44 should not be forgotten			0
' if he could have improved constantly , he would have reached an exceptional level			0
about his potential , he is better than me , better on a technical level , better dribbler , and better scorer too			0
' what a player @entity10 could have had at his disposal			2
