@entity35 , who runs @entity36 from her home in @entity38 , @entity13 , said : ' when he came to us he was really very poorly but he is doing brilliantly and recovering well			2
' we do n't know whether something has happened to mum or if he has gone on a bit of an adventure on his own , but when he came in he had been off his mother 's milk for some time			2
' @entity7 will stay here until he is weaned and then we will move him to a rehabilitation centre where he would stay for about a year until he is ready to be released			1
' but at the moment he is too young to be on his own			2

he will soon move on to fish ms @entity35 said : ' we always try to keep otters in their habitat , but if he had been there a couple of hours longer he may not have been alive			2
' we took him back to the centre and he weighed less than one kilo			2
' he had us worried in the evening after going quite limp and refusing to take fluids but we persevered and eventually managed to get him to drink small amounts from a syringe at first			0

young otters who have been separated from their mothers need a lot of reassurance and love			0
' he is a very affectionate and playful little thing , and likes cuddles			0
' the cub will stay with ms @entity35 for around a month before being moved to another larger centre where he will be able to have contact with other young otters			1
but ms @entity35 , who set up the centre with her daughter , @entity84 , said : ' the plan is always for him to be released back into the wild , which will probably be after around a year			1
' i will miss him when he goes			0
it was difficult when he first came , you never know if they will survive or not			0
but he got through the first night and has been going from strength to strength ever since			0
' we do n't know what happened to the rest of his family			0
we searched the river to see if we could find any siblings , but there was no sign			0
' he is too young to be out of the holt , he would have died if he had n't been found			0
we think something probably happened to mum , and he crawled out			0
