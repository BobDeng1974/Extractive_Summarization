i have sensitive eyes and always struggle to find a decent , affordable eye make - up remover			1
which ones do you recommend ? @entity5 , 56 , @entity6			0
eye make - up remover is one of the biggest unsung heroes on our bathroom shelves			1
even if you wear only mascara , you still need something to take it off effectively without irritating your eyes			1
many women struggle to find an eye make - up remover that is both effective and good for their skin ( picture posed by model ) dr @entity19 , cosmetic dermatologist at @entity20 ( woodfordmedical.com ) , advises trying make - up removers containing botanical ingredients , and staying away from fragranced formulations as they can irritate			1
‘ @entity26 cleansing waters are water - based cleansers containing molecules that act like magnets , lifting away make - up and impurities from the skin , ’ she says			1
‘ they tend to work well for sensitive eyes as they ’re gently formulated			2
’ the new @entity36 , ( £ 3.33 , @entity37 ) is unperfumed and suitable for sensitive skin			2
@entity39 , education manager at the @entity40 , says : ‘ it ’s always better to use a specialised product for the eyes rather than an ordinary cleanser , as these products are specially tested for use on the thin skin of this very delicate area			1
‘ a water - soluble oil is best for removing heavy eye make - up and waterproof mascara			1
‘ a gel is particularly good for people who wear glasses , contact lenses or have sensitive eyes because they are light , gentle and wo n’t leave a residue on the eyes			2
’ you do n’t have to break the bank with eye make - up removers			1
here are my top budget options that are as easy on the purse as they are on the eyes : @entity66 ( £ 5 , @entity67 ) @entity66 ( £ 5 , @entity67 ) this non-greasy formula removes heavy , smoky eye make - up , liner and waterproof mascara without having to rub the sensitive eye area			1
one saturated cotton pad gets everything off in one swipe			0
this is the best value of all the ones i tried — the 250ml version will last for ages			0
10/10 @entity80 ( £ 2.53 , @entity37 ) @entity80 ( £ 2.53 , @entity37 ) an eye make - up remover that has been designed for those with particularly sensitive eyes and those who wear contact lenses			1
though it is n’t good for removing waterproof mascara , it is refreshing and soothing and it wo n’t irritate			0
9/10 @entity91 ( £ 1.99 , @entity91 ) @entity91 ( £ 1.99 , @entity91 ) pure is a well - priced skincare range from @entity91 and the eye make - up remover is gentle and effective , even getting rid of waterproof eyeliner			1
this is not 100 per cent organic , but at this price , i wo n’t hold that against it as it ’s gentle , which is what we ’re looking for			0
9/10 @entity106 ( £ 1.50 , @entity107 ) @entity106 ( £ 1.50 , @entity107 ) these hypoallergenic and fragrance - free pads are handy if you ’re travelling and they are also fabulous for removing morning - after panda eyes if you failed to cleanse properly before going to bed			1
they ’re great value , as they work out at only 5p per pad			0
they did n’t irritate my eyes or leave oily residue			2
keep in your handbag to repair mascara smudges during the day			0
8/10 monday master class : two - minute @entity122 big , bushy brows are fashionable , but what do you do if yours have become thinner and shorter over the years ? i went to make - up artists @entity127 and @entity129 , the top - rated @entity131 beauty gurus with millions of subscribers to their @entity134 channel , for a lesson in the two - minute brow lift			1
‘ the aim is to get real - looking brows that do n’t look stencilled on , ’ says @entity127			2
‘ if you are using a pencil , make sure it is sharp or you wo n’t get the fine , feathery strokes you need			2
and you do n’t want to draw lines that are too thick and end up with caterpillar brows			0
’ @entity144 ( centre ) visited make - up artists @entity127 ( left ) and @entity129 ( right ) for a lesson in the two - minute brow lift first , @entity127 applied a neutral shade of shadow , @entity151 eye shadow in @entity152 ( £ 4.99 , @entity37 ) , all over the lid using an oval shadow brush ( £ 15 , @entity155 , @entity37 )			1
its full , round shape makes it easy to apply shadow quickly			2
next , @entity127 used a pointed crease brush ( £ 12 ) to apply a darker brown shadow along the lash line and into the socket and then blended it in			0
‘ as we age , the lids droop , so doing this gives the illusion of a brow lift , ’ she says			0
the next step is to brush your brows into shape — upwards to give an arched look			0
they used @entity177 sculpting mascara ( £ 4.99 , @entity37 ) , which is a tinted gel that sets your brows			0
colour is key : avoid too dark or too gingery			0
the finishing touch is to apply a tiny amount of gel brow mousse — @entity183 ( £ 15 , @entity184 ) applied with an angled liner brush ( £ 10 ) , which can be used for liner and to fill in sparse brows			0
this brush ’s firm , slanted head allows you to get really close to the lash line , and it is also excellent for painting tiny fine strokes into your brows , making them look thicker and fuller			0
if you buy only one make - up brush , make it this one			1
