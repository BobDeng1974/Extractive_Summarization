by @entity0 for @entity1 it 's a problem all bird - lovers will relate to - you go out and buy expensive seeds and leave them out in your feeders - only for a greedy squirrel to come along and steal the lot			2
but a @entity12 couple have come up with an ingenious solution , which involves turning their feeder into a squirrel slip'n'slide			1
@entity18 and @entity17 , from @entity19 , were being constantly thwarted by one particularly plump critter , which would run up the pole to their bird feeder and make off all of their seeds stored in its cheeks			1
the video shows the persistent squirrel trying time and time again to clamber up the greasy pole , only to slide all the way back down every time			1
it tries several different tactics , including working its way up slowly from the bottom and taking running leaps at the pole , but no matter what , the result is always the same			0
failed again : the plucky rodent refuses to give us , but each time finds itself back at the bottom of the pole mr @entity56 posted as the caption to the video : ' @entity59 has been raiding our bird feeder , carrying away pounds of seed			0
@entity17 figured a quick solution			0
i do n't know which is funnier , the squirrel or @entity17 's narration			0
' for anyone who is concerned about the squirrel , he still raids our other two feeders and the vegetable garden			0
the tiny amount of @entity30 used is non-toxic , the kind used for lip balm			0
he quickly learned that this feeder was not worth the trouble , so we have not put more on the pole , and the birds are delighted to actually get some of the bird seed			2
' eyes on the prize : the feeder which the squirrel had been so eagerly raiding until the @entity30 saved the day the couple laugh hysterically as they watch the poor squirrel 's failed thieving attempts , while mrs @entity17 adds sound effects and comments : ' he 's not going to give up , is he ? ' mr @entity56 runs a website called ' the happy scientist ' , on which he posts entertaining and informative videos teaching people about everything from rocks to rubber bands , as well as performing experiments			1
on the squirrel video , he said : ' you could find some science in it if you think about friction , animal behavior , etc. , but most people enjoy it because of @entity17 's funny narrative and sound effects			1
