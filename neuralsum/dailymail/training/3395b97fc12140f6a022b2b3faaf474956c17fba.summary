@entity0 has claimed the @entity2 number plate scandal was not deliberate by saying if it was the @entity4 would have fired him			1
the @entity7 presenter – along with co-hosts @entity8 and @entity10 , and their crew – had to flee @entity12 last week after locals were angered by a number plate on a @entity15 he was driving			1
they believed the plate , ‘ @entity20 ’ , was in reference to the 1982 @entity19			2
@entity0 said had his employer thought he was in on the controversy he would have lost his job			1
' and if he thought for one moment that i was in some way responsible for the whole sorry affair , i 'd be out on my ear			2
' he said his employer had ' done all the digging ' , checked dates and who purchased the car and why , and for once ' for once @entity7 has done nothing wrong '			0
@entity0 and tv controller , mr @entity38 have had a fractious relationship			2
in august it was revealed that mr @entity38 had launched an investigation into @entity7 after footage was leaked of @entity0 saying ' n * * * * ' in an out take			2
it was one of a number of controversies to hit the show in recent months			0
mr @entity38 gave @entity0 a final warning and ordered a review of the show 's culture and practices , saying there had been ' some significant issues ' on the programme			2
the @entity67 had a licence plate that read @entity69 which locals believed was in reference to the @entity19 ; @entity0 said his crew changed the plate as soon as the controversy was pointed out to them recalling how the number plate controversy came about , @entity0 said when he asked the office to find a @entity67 , only two were available			1
one was grey and the other black			0
he said because black ' does n't work on television ' he chose the grey one , and ' did n't even see it ' until he arrived in @entity12			0
@entity0 went on to say no one in the @entity7 crew realised the potential offence the plate would cause until three days later while they were filming in @entity87			1
its significance was pointed out to the crew on the internet , the show 's executive producer has said			0
government officials were then contacted and asked if the plate would be a problem when they arrived in @entity96 two weeks later , @entity0 said			1
the were told to change it before they arrived , which @entity0 said created continuity issues as the car had already been filmed			1
@entity0 said they then formed a ' cunning plan ' to make - up for the number plate swap			1
they created joke plates - saying @entity107 - which they planned to film may and @entity10 fitting on the car without his knowledge making him look ' idiotic ' when he drove it			0
to make up for continuity issues involving the plates @entity0 said the crew created these joke plates which they were going to put on the car to make him look ' idiotic ' when he was driving around but before the crew had a chance to film the scene they were set upon by an angry mob who threw rocks at their cars			1
the @entity20 plates were then removed , revealing an old personal plate underneath , which they left on , then drove off			2
the cars were later abandoned			0
an @entity12 judge is now reportedly considering whether to begin a criminal inquiry into unauthorised ‘ plate changing ’ on the vehicle			0
the offence carries a jail sentence of up to three years			0
@entity0 concludes by saying the episode will be aired at @entity132 and viewers can make up their own minds about whether the incident happened by chance , or was a made for television stunt			1
yesterday may said the @entity15 had its original number plate , something they had no power over , and that any suggestion they deliberately requested it was ' nonsense '			1
he went on to say the plate was ' actually meaningless ' , saying : ' if you looked at it you have to want to see the meaning			0
' and added : ' we were n't thinking about the @entity19 , we were going to do an epic long , very difficult drive , to celebrate @entity153 cars			0
' we would n't drudge up a war , especially one in living memory , and make a mockery of the casualties			0

@entity0 said he 'd be ' out on my ear ' if plate stunt was deliberate
that they only had two @entity15 to choose from and chose on colour alone
he said that the second set of plates was to cover up continuity isses
