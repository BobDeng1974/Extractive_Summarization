the @entity12 leader said the prime minister was ‘ demeaning his office ’ with a political strategy to ‘ sling as much mud as possible in the hope that some of it sticks ’			1
his outburst follows weeks of negative headlines for the @entity12 , from the vote - rigging scandal in @entity24 to last week ’s revelations about former co-op chairman @entity7 , a former @entity12 councillor who was arrested as part of a drugs inquiry			1
@entity28 , the @entity29 , said mr @entity2 ’s complaints showed the party could not take scrutiny and tended to ‘ clam up ’ when facing difficult questions			2
the @entity12 leader said in an article for the @entity35 : ‘ @entity8 used to claim he wanted to change his party and lead it back to the middle ground			1
‘ that project has now entirely disappeared			0

’ accusing the @entity44 of employing tactics of ‘ smear and character assassination ’ , he wrote that at last wednesday ’s prime minister ’s questions , mr @entity8 had ‘ hit a new low by trying to use the gross errors and misconduct of one man , @entity7 , to impugn the integrity of the entire @entity12 movement ’			1

movie night : disgraced @entity7 goes to the cinema in @entity81 with @entity82 on thursday night ‘ incredibly , @entity12 ’s new campaign chief @entity83 used to be @entity74 ’s right - hand man – it ’s the same old @entity12			1
we suggest they explain how the corruption at @entity24 happened , and how the @entity88 was allowed to become and remain an adviser , rather than dismiss legitimate questions as smears			1
’ mr @entity28 criticised the @entity2 for his ‘ coquettish reticence ’ in dealing with the scandals			0
he said it was hypocritical of @entity12 not to expect to have to answer questions about @entity7 , but he insisted there was no @entity39 plan to fight a dirty campaign			1
‘ we need to have lots of questions : that ’s why the chancellor of the exchequer took the advice of independent people to set up an inquiry , which will ask searching questions about what went on right up to the moment that we discovered everything we discovered about @entity7 , ’ he said			1
‘ the difficulty @entity12 has is they were the people responsible for appointing , or allowing @entity7 to be appointed , on their watch			1
