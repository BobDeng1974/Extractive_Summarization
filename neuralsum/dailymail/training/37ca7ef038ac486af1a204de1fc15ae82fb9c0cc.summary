by @entity0 one of the most difficult things about combining work and motherhood is finding the time to go to the gym			1
shameful as this may sound , it ’s always last on my to - do list			2
the problem is that a ) i do n’t really care enough about being super-thin and b ) i would always rather spend what little spare time i have with my family than de-larding my buttocks on some sweaty treadmill			0
as a result , i ’m always looking for other ways to cut corners , or should that be curves ? @entity19 , well - fitting bras , clever tailoring — these are the lazy tricks of the trade that help keep a not - so - slender 46 - year - old like me looking in shape			1
luckily , there ’s been a @entity28 explosion of garments designed to fit and flatter the fuller figure			1
women are spoilt for choice when it comes to elaborate underpinnings			0
and they look so much better now than they used to : no more granny knickers and hefty bras ; modern shapewear , as its called , is glamorous , lacy and , dare i say , sexy			1
and the trend has n’t stopped at underwear			0
the shops are full of actual clothes , from jeans to dresses , which are cleverly tailored and stashed with hidden panels discreetly to help out big girls like me — and at great prices			2
the dress @entity51 wore to introduce chancellor @entity53 ’s speech at the @entity54 this week was a perfect example of the genre : grey tweed with strategically placed lace panels to slim the waist			0
it was business - like yet feminine and at £ 38 from @entity61 , a bargain worthy of a canny @entity63 decided to road test this new generation of figure - fixing dresses			2
here ’s how they fared ...			0
