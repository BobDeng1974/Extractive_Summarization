a @entity1 court has sensationally thrown out a case against a former @entity4 member accused of taking part in the massacre of hundreds of @entity8 villagers during the @entity9			1
@entity10 , 89 , had been accused of being a member of an armoured ss division that attacked @entity12 on june 10 , 1944 - savagely murdering nearly all of its inhabitants			1
but the case against the elderly suspect - who had been charged in january with the murder of 25 people committed by a group , and with aiding and abetting the murder of several hundred others - was dramatically dismissed this morning for lack of evidence			1
@entity10 , who lives in @entity26 , said he is haunted by the massacre of 642 civilians - and although he admitted being in the village with his @entity4 regiment on the day , denied ever killing anybody			1
charges against @entity10 , who was 19 at the time of the atrocity , were initially filed by the prosecutor 's office in @entity53			1
had he been convicted , it is almost certain @entity10 would have spent the rest of his life in jail			1
the massacre the man had been accused of taking part in took place in the tiny village of @entity12 in western @entity8 on june 10 , 1944			1
it is understood to have been a brutal act of retribution following the purported kidnapping of a @entity4 commander			1
@entity4 members stormed a barn where 181 men had gathered , using pistols and automatic weapons to murder them all before setting fire to the structure			1
they are believed to have then moved on to a church where a further 254 women and 207 children were killed using explosives and machine guns			1
@entity10 , 89 , was accused of being a member of an armoured @entity4 division that attacked @entity12 on june 10 , 1944 - savagely murdering nearly all of the its inhabitants remains of homes in @entity12 , where inhabitants were massacred and all homes and businesses destroyed by @entity91 70 years ago @entity10 says he has had nightmares about the massacre ever since it took place - particularly over one small boy whose life he was unable to save			1
' there was this boy , ' he said			0
' he came walking over the hill			0
a small blonde boy with a bicycle and he wanted to go past me and into the village			2
i can still picture it exactly			0
' ' i stopped him and wanted to chase him away , but then the junior squad leader came up and started yelling at me			0
' ' not a night goes by in which i do n't think of @entity12			1
in front of me , i can still see the church through the treetops			2
i hear a bang and then the screaming of women and children			2
' ' i ca n't get it out of my mind			0
i felt so dreadfully sorry for them			0
but the worst is that i could n't save the boy			0
' last september @entity1 president @entity120 ( left ) became the first @entity1 leader to visit the site when he joined @entity123 ( right ) and two of the three living survivors on a tour of @entity12			2
memories : @entity123 and @entity120 were accompanied by two of only three living survivors of the @entity12 massacre - @entity130 , 88 , and @entity131			1
prosecutors had accused @entity10 of helping the massacre take place by either blocking off or acting as a lookout along the road leading to the church , or by carrying flammable material to help burn the building down once the murders had been carried out			1
the suspect , who admitted being in @entity12 at the time and confirmed his involvement with the local @entity4 branch , has always denied having anything to do with the massacre of 642 people			1
the village has been a ghost town since the massacre , with rusting cars nestled long - abandoned beside the rubble of the burned - out church			1
today @entity12 exists as a massive memorial - a chilling time capsule where the burned out homes remain exactly as they were on the day they were torched , and even the car of the mayor still lies rusting in the main street			1
location : @entity12 is in central @entity8 , approximately 250 miles south of the capital @entity163 @entity1 soldiers killed all 642 inhabitants , including children			1
the men were rounded up and shot in barns , the women were herded into the local church which was set ablaze with hand grenades homes and business were all torched by rampaging @entity4 officers , leaving just empty shells remaining the atrocity is an understandably sensitive subjective for @entity8 , and last september @entity1 president @entity120 became the first @entity1 leader to visit the site when he joined @entity123 and two of the three living survivors on a tour of @entity12			1
in a sign of post-war unity , @entity120 said he felt a ' mixture of gratitude and humility ' as he visited the site with his @entity8 counterpart @entity123			2
the statesman added : ' the @entity190 that i have the honour of representing is a different @entity190 from the one that haunts memories			0
' in return , mr @entity123 said : ' you have made the choice to visit - this is a tribute to you , and at the same time it forces us , once the past has been acknowledged , to go boldly into the future			0
' @entity123 and @entity120 were accompanied by two of only three living survivors of the @entity12 massacre - @entity130 , 88 , and @entity131			1
rubble : survivors look for the bodies of victims within the remains of the village shortly after the massacre destroyed : a burned out building is seen in @entity12 just days after the atrocity took place the exterior of the @entity214 in @entity12			1
only six villagers survived the attack a military tribunal opened in @entity218 in 1953 to try the surviving 65 of the approximately 200 soldiers involved in the massacre			2
however , many could not be extradited from the new @entity190 , and 14 of them were @entity223 - @entity8 nationals of @entity1 extraction			2
20 men were found guilty , but were all released from prison within five years			0
in 2010 , @entity190 re-opened the war crimes file into the massacre after a historian uncovered evidence implicating several still - living suspects			2
using secret files on individuals created by communist @entity190 's @entity236 secret police force , prosecutors identified seven previously unknown members of the @entity4 unit that carried the attack			2
investigations are now underway into six of the men			0
the other suspect is christukat , against whom charges were dropped today			0
early on the morning of 10 june 1944 , the 2nd @entity244 entered the village of @entity12 to avenge the death of a @entity1 officer who had been kidnapped by the @entity248			1
they marched into the town and separated the men from the women and children			2
the men were taken to six barns and shed while the women and children were locked in the church while the village was looted			1
devastated : @entity12 is seen just days after the massacre on june 10 , 1944 the men were said to be shot in the legs before being doused in petrol and set alight			1
six men escaped although one was later found nearby and shot dead			0
in total 190 men perished			0
the soldiers proceeded to the church and tried to set it alight			0
women and children tried to escape through the doors and windows of the church , but were met with machine - gun fire			1
a total of 247 women and 205 children died			2
two women and one child survived ; one was 47 - year - old @entity280			0
she hauled herself out of a window behind the altar , followed by a young woman and child			0
@entity1 soldiers shot all three of them , killing the woman and child by wounding @entity288 who escaped into nearby foliage where she stayed until she was rescued the following day			0
the following is part of her testimony read out to the 1953 @entity218 military tribunal : ' @entity297 burst out in the church then straw , faggots and chairs were thrown pele - mele onto bodies lying on the stone slabs			1
i had escaped from the killing and was without injury so i made use of a smoke cloud to slip behind the altar			0
in this part of the church there are three windows			2
i made for the widest one in the middle and with the help of a stool used to light the candles , i tried to reach it			0
i do n't know how but my strength was multiplied			0
i heaved myself up to it as best i could and threw myself out of the opening that was offered to me through the already shattered window			0
i jumped about nine feet down			0
' when i looked up i saw i had been followed in my climb by a woman holding out her baby to me			0
she fell down next to me but the @entity1 , alerted by the cries of the baby , machine - gunned us			0
the woman and the mite were killed and i too was injured as i made it to a neighbouring garden and hid among some rows of peas and waited anxiously for someone to come to help me			2
that was n't until the following day at 5 p.m. '			0
