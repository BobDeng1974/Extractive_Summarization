an obesity pill that transforms ' bad ' fat to ' good ' could replace exercise , helping people shed pounds and with them their risk of type 2 diabetes , heart disease and cancer			1
that is the claim by scientists who believe they have made a breakthrough in the battle against the bulge			2
they said the discovery could be ' the first step towards a pill that can replace the treadmill '			2
@entity19 at @entity20 and @entity21 have identified two compounds that can turn white or ' bad ' fat cells into brown ' good ' fat cells in the body			1
when a person eats too many calories without burning them off , they are stored as white fat cells by adult stem cells			1
a team of scientists believe they have made a breakthrough which could see an obesity pill replace exercise as people try to fight their weight ( picture posed by model ) that is what causes people to pile on the pounds			1
the new study found two small molecules that convert fat stem cells , which would normally produce white fat , into brown - like fat cells			1
these brown fat cells burn excess energy and subsequently reduce the size and numbers of white fat cells			1
associate professor @entity51 , at @entity19 , said : ' what we were really impressed by is that there are some compounds that have this same kind of effect when they are administered to animals , but when you remove them , the effect goes away			2
' but what we saw here was a stable conversion of the white fat cells to brown cells			1
' you 're constantly replenishing your fat tissue so if you were on a medication to convert the cells , each new fat cell would be more metabolically active and would convert to brown fat over time			1
' the researchers said this reduces the chances of a person developing type 2 diabetes , or any of the other conditions related to a build - up of fat			0
one of the two molecules is already approved to treat rheumatoid arthritis , but scientists warned a pill is some way off			2
they warned the compounds could damage the immune system			0
associate professor @entity89 warned these compounds ' target the same molecule , and that molecule plays a role in the inflammatory response '			0
he added : ' so if you administered them for a long time , the person taking them could become immune compromised			0
' the compounds were found by screening a library of about 1,000 compounds			0
they said the discovery could be ' the first step towards a pill that can replace the treadmill '			2
@entity19 at @entity20 and @entity21 have identified two compounds that can turn white or ' bad ' fat cells into brown ' good ' fat cells in the body ( picture posed by models ) the team said a typical pharmaceutical company library has between 1.5 and 2 million compounds , meaning there could be more similar compounds out there			1
a @entity122 team is currently carrying out tests on the two compounds on laboratory mice and associate professor @entity89 added : ' we expect to have results fairly soon			0
' the compounds appear to work the same way in mice , but we do n't know what the long term metabolic or immune system effects are			0
' the good news and bad news is that science is slow ; just establishing proof of concept takes an enormous amount of time			0
' we thought that working with stem cells would lead to the discovery of new drugs and therapies , and now it 's really starting to happen - a decade of hard basic scientific work is paying off			2
' white fat cells store energy as lipids and play a role in the development of obesity , type 2 diabetes , and related conditions - including heart disease @entity156 fat has been shown in mice to lower triglyceride levels , reduce the insulin resistance associated with type 2 diabetes , and burn white fat			1
however the team pointed out that although any pill might help us stay slim , it would not replace the other benefits of exercise			0
a team of scientists have identified a hormone causes a person to pile on weight , triggering obesity and type 2 diabetes			1
the study found obese people have higher levels of the hormone serotonin in the blood			2
the hormone inhibits the beneficial effects of brown fat - the ' good ' fat that can be burned off - activity			1
@entity156 adipose tissue , known as brown fat , is located around the collarbone and acts as the body 's furnace , burning calories to keep the body warm			1
obese people have lower levels of brown fat , and its activity decreases with age			2
but until now , scientists have not known why			0
the study by @entity197 in @entity198 , @entity199 , found there are two different types of serotonin			0
scientists at @entity199 's @entity197 found obese people have higher levels of the hormone serotonin in the blood ( picture posed by model ) one type is found in the brain or central nervous system affects mood and appetite , but makes up only five per cent of the body 's serotonin			2
the lesser - known peripheral serontonin circulates in the blood , and makes up 95 per cent of the hormone in the body			0
@entity197 scientists discovered that this kind of serotonin reduces brown fat activity , or ' dials down ' the body 's metabolic furnace			1
the study , published in @entity227 , is the first to show blocking the production of peripheral serotonin makes brown fat more active			1
professor of medicine @entity232 , said : ' our results are quite striking and indicate that inhibiting the production of this hormone may be very effective for reversing obesity and related metabolic diseases including diabetes ' too much of this serotonin acts like the parking brake on your brown fat			1
you can step on the gas of the brown fat , but it does n't go anywhere			1
' and the scientists believe they may also have identified the culprit responsible for elevated levels of peripheral serotonin - high - fat @entity253 diets			0
associate professor of pathology and molecular medicine @entity257 , added : ' there is an environmental cue that could be causing higher serotonin levels in our body and that is the high - fat western diet			0
' too much serotonin is not good			0
if there is too much , it leads to diabetes , fatty liver and obesity			0
' the hormone , a model of which is pictured , inhibits the beneficial effects of brown fat - the ' good ' fat that can be burned off - activity the majority of serotonin in the body is produced by tryptophan hydroxylase ( @entity282 )			1
the study found that when they genetically removed or inhibited this enzyme that makes serotonin , mice fed a high - fat diet were protected from obesity , fatty liver disease and pre-diabetes due to an enhanced ability of the brown fat to burn more calories			1
inhibiting the peripheral serotonin does n't affect the serotonin in the brain or central nervous system functioning			0
this is in contrast to earlier weight loss drugs which worked to suppress appetite by affecting levels of brain serotonin , but were associated with problems including cardiac complications and increased risk of depression and suicide			0
professor @entity232 said : ' moving forward , we think it 's a much safer method to work with increasing energy expenditure instead of decreasing the appetite , which involves more risks			0
' the researchers conclude that reducing the production of serotonin by inhibition of @entity282 ' may be an effective treatment for obesity and its comorbidities , ' and so the team is now working on a pharmacological ' enzyme blocker ' .			0

@entity19 scientists claim to have made a breakthrough in the obesity *crisis*
@entity328 could be ' the first step towards a pill that replaces the treadmill '
team found two compounds that turn white ' bad ' fat cells into brown or ' good ' fat cells in the human body
when a person eats too many calories and does n't burn them off , they 're stored as white fat cells , causing a person to pile on the pounds
new study found two molecules that convert fat stem cells , which would normally produce white fat , into brown fat cells
the brown fat cells burn excess energy , reducing number of white fat cells
