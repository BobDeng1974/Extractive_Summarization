@entity0 swept lowly @entity2 aside - click here for our amazing match zone			1
here was an ominous warning for the provincial cities			0
this is precisely the kind of low - grade international football heading your way if @entity0 steps aside to make way for more @entity12 at @entity13			2
the @entity14 , the @entity15 , the @entity16 and the @entity0 are on the way later this year			2
it makes you wonder if thursday 's crowd was swelled by dyslexic gridiron fans hoping to catch a glimpse of legendary quarterback @entity23			0
it was one of those largely pointless one - sided exercises served up in every qualifying campaign , where @entity27 only has to make sure his team turn up on the right day to secure the points			2
what will that do to the crowds at @entity13 ? no wonder the idea is back on the agenda to move some of these less - appealing games to cities where international football is more of a novelty and smaller stadiums , which fill up more easily			0
since @entity13 is not likely to surrender its a-list fixtures			0
these will be the ones earmarked for the travelling circus			0
it was a terrific effort by nearly 56,000 who came along and by @entity0 who coped well with the no - win task at hand			2
@entity27 's team did their best to entertain , sustained a healthy tempo , and never attempted to coast or simplify their football			1
five goals did not reflect their utter domination and plenty of chances were missed , many by @entity33 , who might have scored half a dozen but inched within seven of sir @entity121 's 49 - goal record - six if he can claim the fifth which swerved in off defender @entity119			1
@entity27 wanted to give it him			2
' @entity33 all day , ' he beamed			2
the opener came from the unexpected source of @entity127 , @entity46 continued his fine goal run and @entity47 came off the bench to score his first international goal for a year			1
@entity2 boss @entity131 was happy with five			2
@entity45 , marked out for praise by @entity27 , had a goal wrongly disallowed for offside , there were some remarkable saves from computer science student @entity60 and @entity47 was denied by a late goal - line clearance			1
it may have been a glorified training session but it was a spree to lift spirits ahead of sunday 's qualifier in @entity141 , which promises to be a little trickier , and @entity27 was able to report there were no injuries of note , another key element of the night			1
with his international players falling lame at a rate of one a day , @entity146 must have been among those who looked away			0
five @entity150 players started the second - half , including @entity152 and @entity39 in their first competitive @entity0 game			2
well , competitive in the sense that there were points at stake			0
this particular competition was to see who could puncture the double layer of dark blue insulation on the edge of the @entity164 penalty area and beat @entity60			0
@entity38 ( centre ) plants a header home after 24 minutes to set @entity0 on their way - the @entity171 defender 's first competitive international goal @entity38 is all smiles when being congratulated by @entity37 with goalkeeper @entity60 lying on the floor after tripping over @entity0 captain @entity33 added a second after 43 minutes from the penalty spot - his 42nd international goal @entity33 stroked home with ease past @entity60 into the right - hand corner as @entity0 went two up before the break @entity33 and @entity40 after the penalty , while the @entity182 midfielder appeared frustrated with @entity65 ( right ) @entity46 slides in the third goal just after the break and was given a rest by the manager soon after @entity46 is given a double high - five by @entity150 team - mate @entity41 , who came on as a substitute at the break @entity46 looked delighted after firing home his 11th goal in an @entity0 shirt to begin added gloss to the three points @entity46 was given a breather shortly after finding the net , with @entity195 winger @entity47 his replacement @entity47 cut in from the right - hand side before beating the goalkeeper at his near post in trademark fashion in the 72nd minute @entity47 is congratulated by @entity33 after scoring just minutes after coming on at @entity13 in front of a swathe of empty seats @entity46 put a shift in up front for @entity0 against @entity2 - click here for our brilliant match zone two years ago , @entity60 protected his goal for more than half an hour			1
here , he was beaten after 24 minutes when he came hurtling from his goal - line in pursuit of @entity43 's corner and tripped over his team - mate @entity67			2
as the goalkeeper crashed to the ground , @entity38 leapt to nod the ball into an unguarded net			1
it was the 172nd goal conceded by @entity60 in 40 games			0
it would be 176 by the end of the night			0
if he were bothered by the avalanche of numbers , he would have packed in long ago , as would @entity2 for that matter			0
for them , they have a right to compete on the international stage as the world ' s oldest republic but it is debatable			0
@entity60 was soon launching himself @entity233 - style towards @entity37 's head underlining the danger of @entity237 's comedy mismatches : a student high on adrenalin propels himself like a human missile at the head of a player currently negotiating a Â£ 120,000 - a - week contract at @entity244			0
in truth , @entity0 could have few complaints about the way @entity2 played			1
there were some clumsy challenges , but @entity43 was the first to be booked , raising the question of a how an @entity0 player manages to ease to the brink of suspension in a game like this			0
the night 's second yellow card went to @entity2 's veteran striker @entity71 , who was back in his own penalty area , attempting to clear the ball when he kicked @entity33 in the face			1
@entity33 's spot - kick would have beaten even a professional goalkeeper			1
@entity46 ( left ) saw an early left - footed effort deflected just wide as the hosts tried to turn the heat up on the lowly visitors @entity150 central midfielder @entity42 tries to escape the attention of @entity61 ( left ) and @entity66 ( right ) @entity43 takes a dead ball as @entity27 's @entity0 searched for the opening goal of the night in the @entity32 qualifier @entity43 is brought down by @entity2 's @entity69 down the left as the @entity272 man looked to up the ante out wide @entity39 ( marshaled by @entity69 and @entity274 ) spent the majority of the game deep in @entity2 territory down the left - hand side winger @entity44 - who was brought off at half - time - uses his low sense of gravity to get away from @entity282 ( left ) it was another crash back to earth for @entity60 who had just produced a splendid reflex save to turn a shot over from @entity46 and the cue for @entity27 to start making changes with the trip to @entity291 in mind			1
the limbs of @entity44 and @entity40 were to be preserved , a sign of how important the @entity182 pair have become to their country			0
and , with @entity2 beaten , the fluent movement of @entity41 and vision of @entity45 helped @entity0 ease clear			1
@entity41 set up the second for @entity46 at the near post , within four minutes of the restart			1
@entity45 had his first @entity0 goal wrongly disallowed for offside before @entity47 cut inside from the right to score and @entity33 , having fluffed one elaborate attempted chip , scored with another , helped by the deflection			1
and the best part ? it is over			0
on to more important matters			0
@entity45 zips an effort at goal after replacing @entity44 at half - time during the victory on thursday night @entity33 palms off full back @entity61 as the striker attempts to weave his way inside the away penalty area @entity42 barges @entity65 off the ball in midfield as @entity0 set about knocking the minnows off any stride they tried to conjure @entity41 entered the fray at half - time , replacing @entity44 , as @entity27 made a couple of changes @entity0 supporters belt out the national anthem moments before kick - off at @entity13 on thursday night captain @entity33 leads the @entity0 meeting during the customary huddle ahead of international fixtures @entity335 debuts as @entity0 hit five			1

@entity171 defender @entity38 set @entity0 on their way with a header in the 24th minute
captain @entity33 scored a penalty after 43 minutes as @entity27 's side *cruised* to victory
@entity46 *notched* just after the break with substitute @entity47 firing in a fourth
@entity2 defender @entity58 put through his own net in the 78th minute
