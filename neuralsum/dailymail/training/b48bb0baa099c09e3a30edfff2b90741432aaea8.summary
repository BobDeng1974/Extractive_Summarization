by @entity0 published : 08:51 est , 3 march 2014 updated : 09:00 est , 3 march 2014 recent extreme weather events have highlighted just how important it is to understand our planet ’s behaviour			0
and now a new space mission could help do just that by providing real - time measurements of rain and snow every three hours , all over the world			1
the constellation of satellites will help fill huge gaps in precipitation observations as large areas of the @entity18 currently do not have radar coverage			1
the satellite has unprecedented range , and will scan the skies between 65 degrees north and south latitude the mission , known as @entity25 ( @entity25 ) , will also help scientists look through storms to see the internal dynamics and intensity of a hurricane			1
the satellite has unprecedented range , and will scan the skies between 65 degrees north and south latitude			2
currently , @entity34 ’s @entity33 ( @entity35 ) provides scientists with detailed data on rainfall and storms			0
but the problem is it only covers a relatively narrow range			0
for instance , @entity41 could only be tracked by @entity35 until it passed @entity43 before going out of range			0
the first satellite of the constellation , known as the @entity25 ( @entity25 ) @entity47 , was launched on thursday by @entity34 and the @entity48 ( @entity48 ) while @entity35 measures precipitation in the tropics , the new constellation will also expand the coverage area from the @entity53 to the @entity54			1
this is vital to understanding extreme events , like blizzards , floods and droughts which have wreaked havoc across the globe in recent months			0
the first satellite of the constellation , known as the @entity25 ( @entity25 ) @entity47 , was launched on thursday by @entity34 and the @entity48 ( @entity48 )			1
‘ with this launch , we have taken another giant leap in providing the world with an unprecedented picture of our planet 's rain and snow , ’ said @entity34 administrator @entity63			0
‘ @entity25 will help us better understand our ever - changing climate , improve forecasts of extreme weather events like floods , and assist decision makers around the world to better manage water resources			1
’ @entity25 is one of the ¿ core ¿ satellites in the constellation and will be carrying an advanced radar and radiometer system to measure precipitation from space			2
pictured is the launch which took place on thursday @entity25 will also be able to detect light rain and snowfall , a major source of available fresh water in some regions			0
‘ we still have a lot to learn about how rain and snow systems behave in the bigger @entity18 system , ’ said @entity25 project scientist @entity95 of @entity96			2
‘ with the advanced instruments on the @entity25 , we will have for the first time frequent unified global observations of all types of precipitation , everything from the rain in your backyard to storms forming over the oceans to the falling snow contributing to water resources			1
’ @entity25 is one of nine satellites in the constellation and will be carrying an advanced radar and radiometer system to measure precipitation			2
the gpm core observatory is the first of @entity34 ’s five @entity18 science missions launching this year .			0

@entity25 mission has launched its first satellite
it will provide real - time measurements of rain and snow every three hours
this will extend the detailed radar *map* of local areas to all over the world
currently there are huge gaps in precipitation observations , particularly around the north and south poles
