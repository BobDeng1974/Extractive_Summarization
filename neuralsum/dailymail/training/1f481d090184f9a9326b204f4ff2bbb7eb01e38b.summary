no 10 said ministers had no plans to follow the @entity16 ’s call to require all government suppliers to pay a ‘ @entity10 ’ of up to £ 8.55 an hour			2
a spokesman said that , although mr @entity21 had backed the @entity10 campaign in opposition , the government ’s legal advice was that forcing firms to pay it would potentially break @entity26 procurement laws			1
@entity27 described the government ’s response as ‘ pathetic ’ and said expansion of the @entity10 initiative could benefit up to five million low - paid workers			0
and , in an intervention that will embarrass mr @entity21 , @entity34 mayor @entity33 announced that the living wage in the capital will be increased by 25p an hour to £ 8.55			1
the rate outside @entity34 was increased by a similar amount yesterday to £ 7.45 an hour			2
someone earning the new @entity34 rate would make almost £ 5,000 a year more than someone working 40 hours a week on the @entity43 of £ 6.19 an hour			0
mr @entity33 , whose @entity44 is committed to paying the higher rate , called for all local authorities in @entity34 as well as @entity47 to pay the @entity10			0

he added : ‘ too many people in @entity5 are doing the right thing and doing their bit , helping to build the prosperity on which our country depends , but are n’t sharing fairly in the rewards			0
’ but @entity29 sources said yesterday that forcing employers to pay a certain wage in order to bid for public sector contracts was potentially in breach of @entity26 laws			0
a previous attempt to require government suppliers to pay a special minimum wage in one region of @entity77 was ruled illegal by the @entity78			0
@entity33 announced the new living wage rate in @entity34 will be worth £ 8.55 - an - hour the mayor of @entity34 said the new rate will be worth £ 4.5 million a year for lower - paid workers			1

living wage rate today rose to £ 8.55 - an - hour in @entity34 and £ 7.45 in the rest of the country
