by @entity0 published : 12:10 est , 18 december 2012 updated : 21:11 est , 18 december 2012 @entity1 yesterday delivered a series of thinly - veiled warnings to @entity4 over @entity6 ’s positions on immigration , welfare reform and the @entity9			1
in a highly unusual intervention into @entity13 politics , the former prime minister declined to say whether he would campaign for the @entity14 at the next election expected in 2015			1
days after mr @entity4 claimed previous @entity6 governments had done ‘ too little ’ to deal with the impact of mass immigration , mr @entity1 defended his record and warned that debate on the issue should be ‘ handled with care ’			2
warnings : @entity1 , left , yesterday delivered a series of thinly - veiled warnings to @entity4 , right , over @entity6 's positions on immigration , welfare reform and the @entity9 rejecting suggestions that it had been a mistake to open the door to migrants from new @entity31 members in eastern @entity32 , mr @entity1 said : ‘ people look back and say you should have done more to restrict particularly eastern @entity32 immigration			1
‘ i look back on that , and you can have a debate about it , but personally i think the @entity41 community contributes a lot to this country			2
in many ways immigrants do a lot for our country			2
they bring fresh energy , fresh initiative and i think it will be a sad day if we end up targeting them			0
‘ of course it has to be controlled , and illegal immigration has to be tackled head on			0
but overall i think immigration has been good for @entity13 and most immigrants have assimilated well			0
so do n’t make them a scapegoat for our problems			0
’ mr @entity1 also insisted it was ‘ obvious ’ that major changes needed to be made to sickness benefits and suggested the ageing population meant a fundamental reassessment of the post-war welfare state was necessary			1
his remarks will be seen as a swipe at @entity6 ’s stance on welfare			1
the opposition has criticised almost all of @entity75 @entity74 ’s attempts to trim the vast benefits bill , including increasing most working age benefits by only 1 per cent a year for the next three years			1
comeback kid ? @entity79 ( left ) joined his family on the steps of @entity82 in june 2007 when his father left @entity84 for the last time addressing a lunch attended by @entity87 journalists , mr @entity1 appeared to contradict mr @entity4 ’s insistence that there must be a new @entity91 law following the @entity9 into media standards			1
he agreed with the main recommendations , and did not understand the ‘ vehemence ’ of objections to legislation to back up a more effective newspaper watchdog			0
but he added : ‘ i think that the most important thing is whatever comes out of this is something that ’s independent of government , @entity103 and the media			0
how you do that , i am open - minded about			0
’ in another apparent warning to mr @entity4 , mr @entity1 sided with @entity108 and @entity110 mayor @entity109 by backing their calls for an end to ‘ banker bashing ’ , saying the success of the @entity116 was critical to @entity13 ’s attempts to emerge from the economic mire			1
mr @entity1 refused to indicate whether he would campaign for mr @entity4 in 2015			0
‘ that ’s a long way away , ’ he said			0
‘ i ca n’t really think that far ahead			0
’ @entity13 prime minister @entity1 and @entity121 leader colonel @entity120 in 2004 @entity1 denied any knowledge of the use of torture in the @entity125 , but urged his critics to remember the ‘ context ’ in which the security services were operating			1
the former prime minister was challenged over claims his government was complicit in the extraordinary rendition of @entity121 dissidents , who were allegedly tortured after being handed over to the @entity120 regime			1
last week the @entity13 government agreed to pay £ 2.2million to @entity136 , 45 , who was dispatched with his wife and four young children back to his native @entity121 where he was imprisoned and maltreated			0
the ‘ rendition ’ operation – conducted with apparent @entity142 support – took place only three days after mr @entity1 visited @entity121 for the now infamous 2004 ‘ deal in the desert ’ with @entity120 ( pictured )			1
today mr @entity1 insisted he would not comment on individual cases			0
but he added : ‘ it is just important that people remember that at the time our country was facing a very severe threat from terrorism and we were trying to protect our people and our troops			1
‘ some of those organisations like @entity157 were trying to recruit people to go and kill our people			2
‘ i do n’t believe that anybody in government either condoned or turned a blind eye to the use of torture			2
we would n’t condone the use of torture of maltreatment of suspects at all			2
at the moment of time we were in a very , very tough situation			2
it is important to remember the context , so there it is			0

he defends the @entity182 years , insisting rendition and torture was *wrong* but *happened* at a time when ' our people were *threatened* '
