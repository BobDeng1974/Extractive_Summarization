by @entity0 published : 18:03 est , 18 september 2013 updated : 06:06 est , 19 september 2013 a decision to destroy two @entity3 dogs that guarded prince @entity4 just days after he quit the service has angered animal experts and upset staff on his former base			1
@entity9 , a @entity10 , and @entity11 , a @entity12 , were put down on friday , shortly after the prince completed his final shift as a search and rescue pilot at @entity15 on @entity16			1
charities said the animals had been disposed of like a piece of worn - out military kit while one animal behaviour expert suggested the decision was ‘ a euthanasia of convenience ’			1
the dead dogs were among 288 that the @entity26 has put down in the last ten years			2
protected : prince @entity4 's two @entity3 guard dogs , @entity28 shepherd @entity9 , pictured right , and @entity30 shepherd blade were destroyed on friday just a few days after he left the service base workers pointed out they had been very popular and said animal - lover @entity4 – who has a dog of his own – may also have been shocked by their fate			1
they were part of a unit brought in to provide additional security while the second in line to the throne was based at @entity15			0
a @entity26 spokesman last night insisted that the decision to destroy the dogs was ‘ entirely coincidental ’ and that the animals could not be rehomed or redeployed because of medical and behavioural issues			1
but the decision was the talk of the air base yesterday			0
one member of staff said @entity4 – who has a spaniel , @entity53 – could often be seen giving the dogs a pat. ‘ everyone is talking about the dogs and people are upset they ’ve been put down , ’ the staff member said			1
‘ i saw @entity4 stroke the @entity12 a few times and made a fuss of him			2
they were really popular and @entity4 always said hello to all the handlers			2
’ dog lover @entity4 , pictured here with pet @entity53 , has n't commented on the death of @entity9 , ( right ) who the @entity26 says became too aggressive local resident @entity69 , 59 , added : ‘ i know a few of the lads on the base and i know the dogs were well liked there			1
one told me @entity4 would often go and pat the dogs when he saw them			2
i bet he will be sad that they could n’t have found a safe home			0
’ @entity79 declined to comment yesterday , saying the issue was a matter for the @entity26 @entity4 had been based at @entity15 since 2010			1
he completed his last flight as a @entity84 pilot nine days ago and has now officially left the military			2
@entity11 and @entity9 were in a two - dog section set up to patrol the airbase during the future king ’s deployment			2
they patrolled the station to protect military personnel , equipment and facilities			0
but once the prince left the unit was closed , ’ a source said			0
the two animals were assessed by a squadron inspector to see if they could be returned to the @entity99 , which helps train new handlers			0
but they were both deemed unsuitable			0
@entity11 , nine and a half , suffered from osteoarthritis in the hips and had been diagnosed with the onset of a spinal condition , which is common in @entity12 of that age			0
it was decided he should be destroyed for medical reasons			0
@entity9 , seven and a half , was said to display high levels of stress which resulted in him ‘ self - harming and displaying excessive aggression ’			2
he was deemed ‘ a risk to himself , his handler and others ’			0
family first : prince @entity4 left the @entity3 to spend more time with wife @entity122 and their baby son @entity123 but animal behaviour expert dr @entity130 commented : ‘ behavioural problems are often used as a bland excuse for putting dogs to sleep			1
what you have to do is work hard at making their environment better for them			0
it begs the question , would these dogs still be alive if prince @entity4 was at the base ? it sounds sound like a euthanasia of convenience			1
’ a spokesman for the @entity143 charity said : ‘ dogs are not pieces of disposable kit that can be decommissioned at the end of their useful military life			1
we fully understand that most service dogs can not be rehomed as pets			0
deployment to another role or retirement to a specialist handler are two alternative options			0
’ a spokesman from @entity159 said : ‘ dogs are not tools and are not ours to use and toss away like empty ammunition shells			0
’ asked by the @entity164 whether both dogs were deemed healthy and fit to work up until the time they were destroyed despite the issues they were said to have suffered from , an @entity26 spokesman said : ‘ i do n’t think we are in a position to confirm this			1
’ an @entity3 spokesman said : ‘ whilst security was increased during prince @entity4 ’s tour of @entity15 , which included the introduction of canine security patrols , these dogs and with their handlers , were not solely assigned to @entity179 @entity4 as personal protection			1
‘ the timing of their sad demise was purely coincidental			0
the @entity26 ’s policy is to re-home all military working dogs at the end of their service life wherever practicable			1
these dogs had a record of veterinary and behavioural issues which meant that they could not be reassigned to other duties and they were too aggressive to be kept at home			2

@entity4 left his role as a search and rescue pilot in @entity200 last week
within days of his last shift , his two guard dogs were destroyed on friday
@entity26 said @entity28 shepherd @entity9 had ' come to the end of his work life ’ while @entity30 shepherd blade could n't be reassigned to other duties
outraged charities and activists say decision was ' euthanasia of convenience '
