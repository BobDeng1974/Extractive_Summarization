an oil painting has been proven to be one of @entity2 's - after scientists discovered the artist painted over his own signature			1
the 1891 painting , titled ' @entity7 in the @entity8 ' , was largely unknown and its origin had never been verified			1
but a team of researchers from the @entity12 in @entity13 painstakingly unearthed the signature			1
it is thought to be part of a wider series by @entity2 with all the pieces illustrating stacks of hay in fields after the harvest season			0
the painting was verified after a special camera was used to examine the composition of the work			1
this allowed researchers to see different layers including a previous signature by @entity2			2
it is thought to be part of a wider series by @entity2 ( above ) with all the pieces illustrating stacks of hay in fields after the harvest season @entity44 , a researcher , said the camera scans one ' line ' at a time			0
he told @entity47 : ' when the camera is moved using the scanner an image of the whole picture can be obtained			0
' the @entity21 said the artwork is the first @entity2 painting to be held in a @entity13 public collection			1
the other paintings from the series are held at various galleries including the @entity57 , the @entity58 of @entity59 and the @entity60 in @entity61			0
x-ray fluorescence ( @entity63 ) is a non-destructive technique , which can identify the presence of certain pigments			2
it was first used in the 1940s and applied to paintings in the 1950s			0
the technique involves bombarding the artwork with x-rays so powerful that they cause atoms in the picture ’s layers to emit ‘ florescent ’ x-rays of their own			2
@entity63 can be used to identify the colours of hidden paintings or to see earlier versions of famous pieces			0
by mapping the x-rays of copper , for blue and green , iron , for yellow , orange and brown , and mercury , for red , scientists can see full - colour ' maps ' of previous versions			2
in this case a special camera was used to examine the composition of the work			0
this allowed researchers to see different layers including a previous signature - verifying that the painting was by @entity2 .			1

oil - painting titled ' @entity7 in the @entity8 ' is from 1891
researchers in @entity13 used special technique to unearth signature
