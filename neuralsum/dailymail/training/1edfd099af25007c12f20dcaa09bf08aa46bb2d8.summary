for the first time , researchers have grown a muscle that moves and works just like fibres found in a living human body			1
made from human cells , the lab - grown artificial muscle tissue responded to electrical pulses during tests , and reacted to drug treatments in the same way a hospital patient would			1
experts now hope the tissue could be used to develop personalised treatments and drugs for patients suffering from muscular disorders			0
made from human cells , the lab - grown artificial muscle tissue responded to electrical pulses ( pictured ) , as well as drug treatments in the same way a hospital patient would the muscle could also be used to study diseases , and be used in place of human drug trials			1
the study was led by @entity34 , associate professor of biomedical engineering at @entity36 , and @entity37 , a postdoctoral researcher in professor @entity34 's laboratory			2
‘ the beauty of this work is that it can serve as a test bed for clinical trials in a dish , ’ said professor @entity34			0
scientists have grown ' fully - functioning ' human gut tissue inside a mouse - a breakthrough that could one day help many thousands suffering with intestinal disorders			2
by transplanting cells from a human into a mouse , paediatric surgeons successfully grew small intestine tissue that worked just like the ' real ' thing			0
the research was led by dr @entity57 from the @entity58 ( @entity58 )			0
doctors hope their findings will eventually help treat a range of digestive conditions as well as boost survival rates in sufferers of diseases such as short bowel syndrome ( @entity67 ) - a condition that kills nearly a third of young patients within five years			0
‘ we are working to test drugs without jeopardising a patient 's health and also to reproduce the functional and biochemical signals of diseases - especially rare ones and those that make taking muscle biopsies difficult			0
’ professor @entity34 and ms @entity37 started with a small sample of human cells that had already progressed beyond stem cells , but had n't yet become muscle tissue			1
they expanded these by more than a 1000-fold , and then put them into a form of @entity86 filled with a nourishing gel			1
this gel helped the cells to form aligned and functioning muscle fibres			1
ms @entity37 put the new muscle through a series of tests to determine how closely it resembled tissue found in the human body			2
she found that the muscle fibres robustly contracted in response to electrical stimuli - a first for human muscle grown in a laboratory			1
she also showed that the signalling pathways allowing nerves to activate the muscle were ' intact and functional '			1
the experts started with a small sample of human cells that had already progressed beyond stem cells but had n't yet become muscle tissue			1
they expanded these by more than a 1000-fold , and put them into a form of scaffolding filled with gel			2
this gel helped the cells to form aligned and functioning muscle fibres ( pictured ) ‘ we have a lot of experience making bioartifical muscles from animal cells in the lab , and it still took us a year of adjusting variables like cell and gel density and optimising the culture matrix and media to make this work with human muscle cells , ’ said ms @entity37			1
to see if the muscle could be used for medical tests , professor @entity34 and mr @entity127 also studied its response to a variety of drugs , including statins used to lower cholesterol and clenbuterol , a drug known to be used off - label as a performance enhancer for athletes			2
the effects of the drugs matched those seen in human patients			0
‘ one of our goals is to use this method to provide personalised medicine to patients , ’ said professor @entity34			0
‘ we can take a biopsy from each patient , grow many new muscles to use as test samples and experiment to see which drugs would work best for each person			0
’ the research is published in the journal @entity157			0
this image shows a microscopic view of lab - grown human muscle bundles			1
they have been stained to show patterns made by proteins ( red ) , which are a hallmark of human muscle			0
experts now hope the tissue could be used to develop personalised treatments and drugs for patients suffering from muscular disorders			0

the study was led by biomedical engineers at @entity36
they used cells that were beyond stem cells , but not yet muscle tissue
these cells were put into a form of @entity86 filled with a gel
this gel helped the fibres to form and align like *typical* muscle fibres
during tests , the fibres contracted in response to electrical stimuli
they were also found to have functional signalling pathways in the nerves
this is the first time lab - grown muscles have reacted in this way
