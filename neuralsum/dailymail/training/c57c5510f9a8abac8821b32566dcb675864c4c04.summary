by @entity1 reporter she was in the @entity2 to insist that emergency legislation is needed to allow @entity5 ’s spies to access data about the public ’s phone calls , texts and emails			0
but @entity12 , along with @entity11 , was seemingly unaware of her small fashion faux pas in @entity14 today			2
the optical illusion flesh - toned dress she wore may have left viewers confused - as it appeared that she was revealing more than she bargained on			1
@entity12 told @entity36 : ' without this legislation , we face the prospect of losing access to this data overnight with the consequence police investigations will suddenly go dark and criminals will escape justice			2
we can not allow that to happen			0
' it 's all an illusion ! the home secretary 's flesh - toned dress may have confused viewers unaware : it seems that @entity11 was blissfully unaware of the optical illusion style dress that style savvy @entity12 wore so stylish : the mp has become well - known for her stylish dress sense and today was no different as she stepped out in an @entity54 inspired print dress @entity12 has become quite the style icon in @entity14 and it has been noted that the politician shares many similar sartorial tastes with supermodel @entity59 , who ms may once described as ' one of the most beautiful women in the world '			1
on previous occasions she has been pictured wearing an eye - catching multicoloured coat paired with sassy knee - high leather boots just like a pair worn by @entity69			0
at the @entity71 conference she turned heads in a £ 1,190 @entity74 tartan suit that was earlier showcased by the supermodel on her 21st birthday			0
@entity77 mates : @entity12 may have been pictured in a pair of racy boots just like some sported by @entity59 , but the mp says she definitely does n't share the model 's style dare to bare : @entity12 went for the strapless look just like model du jour @entity59 at a @entity85 event floaty votes : strutting like peacocks in abstract patterns though the home secretary opts for more sensible shoes at a @entity91 shades of grey suits : and both are making great strides ... though one to a glamorous hotel party while the other heads for the @entity98 she is also well - known for her love of leopard print , a style coveted by @entity59 , and famously wore a pair of print kitten heels to the 2002 conference , as well as today in @entity14			1
but the 57 - year - old mp has laughed off similarities between herself and the 21 - year - old supermodel			0
speaking as she collected the @entity108 's @entity110 award last november , she said : ' this is the second good thing that 's happened to me today because this morning , the @entity1 asked : " is @entity12 the new @entity59 ? " ' for those of you who do n't know , she is 21 , a supermodel and one of the most beautiful in the world - so i think we can safely say that the answer to that has to be filed by @entity121 as a question , to which the answer is no. ' @entity126 fans ? @entity12 's tartans look considerably retro compared to @entity59 's 21st birthday suit true blue flowers : while both ladies seem to love florals , @entity59 models a more risque look at @entity134			1
