i have seen nothing like it in my life before			2

shocked : mr @entity12 and mr @entity11 were driven through the area in @entity14 as locals hurled abuse at them ‘ we called the police and they came straight away			1

not impressed : the brothers in law were attacked as they passed through the @entity23 area of the city ' we see people come and go doing charity around here - black , white , @entity134 - but it is not appropriate to do it in a bad way , dressed as they were , especially when this is mainly an @entity134 and @entity139 area			0
' mr @entity12 said : ‘ a man who was in a nearby hairdresser came over and started having a go at us and then a guard at the supermarket and the manager came out and joined in			1

i am shocked and disgusted that this should happen in our city			0
‘ it was like something you see on tv			0
the idea behind the mankini walk started off as a dare and then we decided to make it a reality and do it to raise money for charity			1
’ ‘ we have a love and passion for dogs and we both wanted to do it to raise money for @entity19			1
’ mrs @entity186 added : ‘ i grew up to respect people irrespective of colour or creed as have my children			0
but this was totally appalling and has made me so angry that this should happen during an event to help a charity			0
