should the day ever come when i am asked to perform an after - dinner party trick , i have just the thing prepared : a word - perfect rendition of @entity5 from the musical @entity7			1
all 125 lines of it			2
if the assembled company want an encore — and they wo n’t , for i can not sing in tune — i could also do @entity13 , one day more , do you hear the people sing ? and a @entity16			2
if @entity7 were n’t to the party ’s taste , i could do a medley of numbers from @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 or any of a dozen @entity26 musicals			1
for there are few things i enjoy as much as a high - kicking , leotard - slinking , barricade - mounting , chandelier - crashing , helicopter - blade - whirring , big - budget @entity26 musical			1
@entity32 plays the witch in the new film version of @entity35 's @entity36			1
@entity37 and @entity38 also star			2
@entity39 said the big show - stopper @entity41 makes the hairs on the back of your neck stand up while others may flee up the aisles at the first sign that an adorable urchin is about to break into song , i am slap - bang in the middle of the front row clutching my programme , tapping my foot to the music and singing under my breath			1
it does n’t have to be a stage show			1
a @entity61 or @entity62 film — @entity63 , @entity64 — will do the trick			2
or just the soundtrack listened to through headphones , causing least distress to others			2
there has rarely been a better time to be a fan of musicals			1
we are enjoying a particularly purple patch			0
it was announced recently that producer @entity77 is to make a new film of the musical @entity22 ! with star ballet choreographer @entity79			1
meanwhile , the musical adaptation of the film made in @entity82 , starring bond girl @entity83 as a factory worker crusading for equal pay , has been nominated for a host of awards at the @entity88 in @entity89			1
cats has opened to rave reviews ( ‘ @entity98 - wow ! ’ , ‘ @entity99 - fect ! ’ ‘ the cat ’s whiskers ! ’ ) at the @entity92 , with @entity94 judge @entity93 singing memory , the show ’s big ballad			1
@entity93 stars in the cast of @entity21 at the @entity92			1
the show has opened to rave reviews the @entity35 musical @entity106 has just opened at @entity89 ’s @entity107 , starring comedian @entity108			0
@entity109 — a veteran of @entity110 and @entity111 — is soon to arrive in the @entity26 as @entity112 in @entity35 ’s @entity113 after an acclaimed run at the @entity115			1
an updated @entity116 with a hip - hop soundtrack opened in cinemas on @entity119 , which was followed last week by @entity36 , a film adaptation of another @entity35 great — the @entity122 musical sending up traditional fairytales			1
it stars @entity32 as the witch , @entity126 as the @entity127 , and @entity38 and @entity37 as the hapless @entity128 and his wife			0
musical heaven ! i can not remember a time when i did n’t love musicals			1
the person to thank , or possibly blame , was the wonderful nanny , a proper @entity134 , who came when i was three and my brother was one , and stayed for a decade			1
she arrived , not descending from the sky holding a parrot - headed umbrella , but in a little white @entity138 with a glovebox full of cassettes			1
it was she who introduced us to the soundtracks of @entity7 ( still my favourite ) , @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity146 , @entity147 , @entity148 , @entity149 , @entity150 , @entity151 and @entity152			1
we listened to them on the school run until the tapes unspooled			0
i have never , however , suffered the delusion of @entity94 auditionee			0
there was not a moment , even when i was very young , when i thought i could be grizabella or @entity159 , @entity160 or @entity161			0
@entity61 's @entity162 , released in 2013 and starring @entity163 , is the highest grossing animated film of all time @entity39 grew up in a decade when @entity61 produced some of its greatest musicals , and understands hy little girls today watch @entity61 ’s latest musical frozen dozens of times and sing its anthem let it go but i have always loved listening to those who can sing the socks off an audience			1
i was lucky to grow up in a decade when @entity61 produced some of its greatest musicals			1
the @entity177 opened in 1989 , when i was two			0
@entity178 followed in 1991 and @entity179 in 1992			0
in 1995 , @entity180 won awards for best score and best original song ( @entity185 ’s @entity184 ? ) at the @entity186			0
@entity187 was in cinemas in 1997 , @entity189 in 1998			0
and then , the studio went off the boil			0
@entity192 , @entity193 , @entity194 , @entity195 and @entity196 were all hits in the @entity198 , but not one was a musical			0
@entity61 did n’t come up with another film you could really sing - a - long to until enchanted in 2007			2
@entity204 starlet @entity203 plays @entity205 , a cartoon princess who wakes up in modern @entity206			0
when @entity205 sings an aria to summon the dear little birds and creatures of the forest in the traditional @entity61 princess manner , she finds herself surrounded by the city ’s rats , mice , pigeons and cockroaches			0
@entity61 did n’t come up with another film you could really sing - a - long to until the 2007 film			2
@entity39 went to see it in the cinema four times because the songs were so hummable the songs were so hummable i went to the cinema to see it four times — the only time i ’ve made multiple trips to see one film			1
i can understand why little girls today watch @entity61 ’s latest musical frozen dozens of times and sing its anthem @entity236 , which has been watched nearly 300 million times on @entity238 , until their parents beg for mercy			0
when it comes to the musicals that endure on stage , there is a curious truth : the more improbable the source material , the greater the success			1
the writers of @entity249 got it spot on when they imagined a pair of shysters putting on a musical about the rise of the @entity255 that is certain to fail , in order to make off with the investors ’ money			0
the best - laid plans inevitably go awry and @entity260 is a smash hit			2
@entity7 is based on a 1,200 - page @entity262 novel about the wretchedness of the poor in 19th - century @entity265			2
cats was inspired by a collection of children ’s poems by @entity270 , whose most famous work @entity272 , an epic modernist poem , has baffled scholars for decades			0
@entity275 , which inspired the musical @entity22 ! , is one of @entity277 ’ nastier books			1
the death of @entity161 is particularly brutal , and there ’s not a word about singing milkmaids or dancing pickpockets			2
@entity284 as @entity285 in the 2012 movie adaptation of @entity7			2
@entity39 believes the curious true of musicals is that the more improbable the source material , the greater the success @entity290 as fantine			1
the film is based on a 1,200 - page @entity262 novel about the wretchedness of the poor in 19th - century @entity265 the really great musicals — those that run for 25 years and sell hundreds of thousands of albums — have a peculiar alchemy of music and lyrics			1
they send you home singing			0
when i saw @entity305 , the fizzingly brilliant musical adaptation of @entity309 ’s children ’s book , i had the show ’s big number , @entity312 , on my mind for weeks after			0
of the current crop , i had most been looking forward to @entity36			1
last month , i inveigled my way into a screening			0
i walked home afterwards , hardly noticing the @entity319 shoppers , singing ( quietly ) to myself the whole way			0
@entity35 ’s score whips along			0
the lyrics are witty and ludicrous — only he would try to find a rhyme for ‘ arugula ’ , a type of salad leaf			0
the big show - stopper @entity41 makes the hairs on the back of your neck stand up			2
i cried with laughter when , from the top of a waterfall , @entity204 pretty boy @entity334 , playing a dim - witted @entity333 , belted out @entity337 , a lament about being thwarted in the pursuit of his @entity340			2
@entity126 is no tenor and nor is @entity38			0
@entity32 , a veteran of the @entity344 musical @entity345 ! , falls short of @entity346 , who played the @entity347 in the first @entity122 cast			0
i ’ve had the original album for years			0
some of the songs — according to my computer — have been played more than 300 times			0
the joy of a musical — and this is the test for all those opening in the coming months — is that it should send you home humming , tapping your feet and , in the best @entity360 manner , even swinging from lamp - posts while singin ’ in the rain .			1

there has rarely been a better time to be a fan of musicals
@entity36 , @entity162 , and @entity116 are dancing along our movie screens
new productions of @entity21 , made in @entity82 , and @entity373 are on stage
and @entity22 ! and @entity113 will soon be coming too
@entity39 fell in love with musicals thanks to a @entity134 - like nanny
