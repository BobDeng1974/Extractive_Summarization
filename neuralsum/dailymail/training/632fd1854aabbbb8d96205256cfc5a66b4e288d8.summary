@entity0 launched a scathing attack on @entity2 after they threw away a three goal lead to draw 3 - 3 with @entity5 in the @entity6			1
speaking on @entity9 after the match , the former @entity8 midfielder slammed the team 's overly - offensive tactics as @entity14 's side squandered a three - goal lead			1
on eleven separate occasions he slammed the current side as ' tactically clueless ' and berated the mental weakness of the @entity8 players			1
here , @entity21 's @entity20 analyses where it 's going wrong for @entity2			2
@entity2 squandered a three goal lead against @entity25 to draw in the @entity6 on tuesday @entity5 players celebrate what seemed like an unlikely draw with their fans at full - time at the @entity31 pundit @entity0 , who played for @entity2 in the nineties , was incensed at his former side 's capitulation @entity0 spent twelve years at @entity35 and made nearly 300 league appearances for the north @entity38 club the conundrum he can do it			1
check the date and note the venue : 21st may , 2005 , @entity43 , @entity44			0
@entity14 spent the years running up to that @entity46 final saying that he would never abandon his attacking instincts and his beloved 4 - 4 - 2 system			1
and yet that day in @entity44 he did			0
so confused were observers that it took time to work out @entity2 ’s formation : yes , he really was playing 4 - 5 - 1 with @entity52 as a lone striker – and even he was dropping deep to help out			1
@entity2 's current midfield lacks the steel and prowess of players like @entity58 ( left ) and @entity59 @entity2 won the @entity46 in 2005 after manager @entity14 opted for a 4 - 5 - 1 formation over the usual 4 - 4 - 2 that day @entity2 had @entity61 at centre back facing a @entity64 attack of @entity65 and @entity66 with @entity67 on the wing and @entity69 and @entity70 in midfield			1
and yet they did it ; with @entity73 injured and with a much weaker team than @entity64 , they eked out their draw and won on penalties			0
likewise , a year later in 2006 in the @entity6 final against @entity78 : down to ten men after the sending off of @entity80 , @entity2 defended manfully for 76 minutes , holding on to a 1 - 0 lead and only succumbing in that final quarter of an hour			1
so if @entity14 could do it then , why ca n’t @entity2 do it now ? and , against @entity5 , of all teams ; not exactly @entity64 or @entity78			1
@entity2 centre back @entity61 played in the final and kept out the likes of @entity65 ( pictured ) goalkeeper @entity80 was sent off in the 2006 @entity6 final and held onto a lead until late on the central problem ? it 's the midfield , @entity92 ... the back four have naturally been the focus of the capitulation on tuesday night and rightly so in one respect			1
but while it is true that @entity2 ’s defence had an awful night against @entity5 , the warning signs had been clear in the opening twenty minutes when @entity101 had acres of space in which to operate in front of the defence			1
there is rarely any protection given to @entity2 defenders			2
maybe @entity14 believes that is the way the modern game has evolved but few seem to share his belief ; and it is not what he once believed			2
when he was consistently winning trophies , @entity2 were a more pragmatic team than they have been in the last nine years , when one trophy has been gleaned			2
now it is all about accumulating dainty , skilful midfield player , who are glorious to watch ; back in 1996 , among his first recruits for the club were @entity58 and @entity59 , strong midfielders , with height and power			1
after @entity59 , there was @entity126 , and that cup final in 2005 was @entity58 ’s last game , after which the trophies dried up			1
those midfielders could get forward and contribute to attack but they had a basic defensive mind - set and a protective instinct ; neither @entity132 , nor @entity135 nor @entity136 has that ; @entity138 does , but with neither the athleticism nor the technical ability of his predecessors			0
@entity5 's @entity101 , pictured against @entity142 , had space to operate in front of the defence midfield duo @entity58 and @entity59 celebrate @entity2 's @entity147 title win in 1998 @entity138 ( left ) has a defensive mind - set but lacks the technical ability of his predecessors the defence ? there is no defence , but ... that said , the back four is clearly weak and insufficient for the task of winning a @entity147 title or the @entity6 , which brings us back to a familiar refrain at @entity2 about the lack of recruitment			1
wenger himself predicted before the season began that @entity162 would experience a dip in form after winning the @entity165 , as @entity58 and @entity59 did in 1998			1
so why , when @entity166 was sold , was there no replacement signed ? @entity169 may well be a centre half in the future , but at 19 years old , clearly was n’t ready to be a regular in that position			0
he is raw and potential to be excellent but is often exposed in his more natural position at right back , likewise , @entity174 does n’t always convince at left back , so being asked to play centre half is a big ask			0
@entity14 ’s retort would be that it is tough to recruit a third - choice centre half : a world class defender wo n’t accept that and anything else would be sub-standard			2
but that is rather like fisherman complaining about the sea			0
it ’s just part of the job			0
entering a season with two recognised senior centre halves was clearly a risk too far ; it does n’t need the clarity of hindsight to say so ; plenty said it in august			0
per @entity162 has experienced a dip in form while @entity169 lacks experience at centre back the philosophy the 2005 fa cup final should be @entity14 ’s reference point			2
it is n’t of course but it should be			0
@entity14 is coy his footballing inspirations but from outside it always seems as though @entity209 ’s attack - minded football is his blueprint , though there has always been a healthy regard for @entity214 ’s @entity213 , which is why 4 - 4 - 2 was once his mantra			2
clearly he will always be an attacking coach and we should applaud him for that			0
but so wide are the gaps in @entity2 ’s midfield at times - successive games at @entity221 over the past ten years come to mind , last season ’s 6 - 0 simply being the worst – it seems been blinded by his own beliefs , like a political leader wedded to an misguided ideology			1
the more @entity14 ’s teams struggle , the more determined he is to win something without physical defensive players , as if to prove a point			2
but that was n’t how he established his name as a manger , not at @entity2 , nor at @entity235 , where midfielders @entity236 and @entity238 were his engine room			0
the more @entity14 ’s teams struggle , the more determined he is to win without physical players it seems perhaps there is hope			0
@entity2 are in the market for a strong , mobile athletic defensive midfielder			0
in fact it is their no.1 priority , more so than a centre half			0
@entity250 at @entity251 looks to be the prototype - he defends and he is huge - but @entity2 do n’t believe he is mobile enough so is unlikely to be the answer			2
anyway his links to @entity255 , @entity256 ’s agent , means @entity2 would struggle to sign him			0
it is noticeable that @entity255 players hardly ever go to @entity2			0
what is clear is that he is the type of players that is required			0
if @entity14 can not rediscover his roots , the @entity5 debacle – which can be added to the calamities at @entity266 and @entity221 from last season – will repeat			1
but if he could remodel a side based on axis like @entity58 and @entity59 , imagine what his team could achieve ? @entity250 is a huge defensive midfielder but @entity2 do n't believe he is mobile enough			1

@entity2 squandered three - goal lead to draw with @entity5 at home
@entity14 sides of old were capable of eking out results
however , the current @entity2 defence lack protection
the @entity8 miss the midfield steel of @entity58 and @entity59
