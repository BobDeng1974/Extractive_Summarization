it 's known as the beautiful game , but in tudor times football should perhaps have been called the dangerous game			1
@entity5 stars may dive and feign injuries , but in the 16th century more people died playing it than sword - fighting , a historian has discovered			1
seven footballers were killed after clashes in @entity15 villages between 1500 and 1575 , new research has revealed			1
violent clash : football matches were more like @entity18 matches - but without the padding			1
games in @entity21 would involve dozens of players and last for hours records show the sport was more violent with physical clashes and contact resulting in people being badly injured and accidentally crushed			1
the game involved dozens of players competing against one another			0
players would clash violently in a sport that was similar in style to @entity18 - but without the padding			1
the facts have been uncovered by @entity37 historian dr @entity36 , who examined @entity21 coroner ’s records for information			1
as part of a wider project into accidental deaths in the 16th century , he found a significant proportion of deaths came from sport and recreation			1
although the modern game was born in the late 19th century , the origins of football go back centuries			1
the first recorded game took place in @entity54 in 1170 and was recorded by @entity55			1
matches would spring up on an ad - hoc basis across the country			0
the violent fixtures would go on for hours if not days and deaths were not uncommon			1
some historians have said the sport was first started as a war game and was often played between villages			1
it is believed that although it was called football , players could pick the ball up and run with it as well as kick it			2
@entity71 banned the sport in 1314 because he was concerned men were more interested in it than archery			1
however , it was ignored and prosecutions were rare so the game continued to flourish			0
despite repeated attempts to crackdown on the sport the game was never killed off			1
when @entity84 and universities started playing the game it started becoming more gentlemanly			0
but it was not until 1857 that the first football club - @entity88 - were found			2
they are still in existence			0
the @entity91 - the world 's oldest football rule - book - was written a year later in 1858 and is seen as the basis of the modern game			2
back then matches lasted for two hours and 40 players were involved			0
the @entity98 was founded in 1888 and @entity99 were the first winners			0
football was the second most dangerous sport during the period - beaten only by the death toll of 56 from archery			1
it was followed in joint third place by wrestling , sword - fighting and - oddly - bell ringing , which each caused three deaths			2
other notably dangerous sports included hammer throwing , which caused two deaths , and quoits , which caused one			1
@entity116 is a northern game which involves throwing a ring towards a set target			0
in one of the record uncovered , from february 20 , 1523 in @entity122 , @entity123 , said a football player died as he challenged for the ball			2
the entry read : ' @entity127 of @entity128 was playing football with @entity130 of @entity128 , labourer , and many others			2
' they were running after a certain ball called the " foteball " , no malice being between them , and both came to the ball at once and fell to the ground			0
' @entity130 fell on top of @entity127 and crushed his body by misfortune , so that @entity127 immediately died			0
' of the seven footballers to die while playing the game , two men were accidentally stabbed with a knife in the process of tackling an opponent			1
others suffered internal injuries from hefty falls while one player died from a broken leg			0
on february 20 , 1508 @entity153 was playing in @entity154 , @entity155 , and had his knife hanging from his belt and was killed			1
the record states : ' he fell onto it by misfortune , it struck him in the body and he immediately died			0
so he killed himself by misfortune			2
' in a bizarre death , a man was killed after being pulled into the air as he rang a bell before plunging to the floor			2
in an entry from @entity170 , @entity171 , on august 22 , 1568 it was recorded : ' @entity172 was in the bell - tower of the church			2
' he rang " the thirde bell " , pulling a rope attached to the wheel of the bell , but the rope caught round his feet and pulled him seven feet off the ground , from which height he fell head - first onto the paved floor of the bell - tower			0
' he languished until 6pm on august 23 , when he died			0
' the bell , rope and wheel , which remain in custody of inhabitants of @entity190 and are worth 13s 4d , were the cause of the accident			0
' perhaps unsurprisingly , wrestling was also a dangerous sport with participants dying from accidental but predictable wounds			1
modern game : tudor football is a far cry from the almost contact - free modern game			2
here @entity15 's @entity202 is booked for diving in one bizarre accident , on october 31 , 1518 , a @entity204 was playing and wrestling in the churchyard at @entity208 near @entity209 in @entity210 , @entity211 , with @entity212 and @entity213			0
records show : ' @entity215 of @entity208 , husbandman , came to them and said that he was a manly man who could throw all three of them over the churchyard wall			0
' @entity204 said that he could not			0
@entity215 took @entity204 and without malice or ill - will took him and put him over the churchyard wall			0
' @entity204 fell to the ground and his knife , which was sticking out of its sheath , by great misfortune pierced a vein under the elbow in his right arm to the depth of an inch and his blood flowed out copiously			2
' archery was the sport that led to most deaths			1
an entry on june 2 , 1542 in @entity235 , @entity236 , states : ' @entity237 sat on the churchyard wall watching archers shooting at targets next to the wall			0
old game : an artists impression of wealthy boys from the @entity21 era playing football ' they warned him several times to get down lest he get hit , but he would not			1
' @entity251 ’s arrow struck him on the left side of the head and he languished until 12 june , when he died			0
' dr @entity36 , from @entity254 , @entity37 , said it was surprising how in - depth the records were			0
danger : 56 people were killed by archery in the @entity21 era , the researcher found he said : ' it ’s remarkable what you can work out by examining coroner ’s records			1
the level of detail in some of them is surprising			0
' the most dangerous sport by far was archery , but there are other more unusual sports which resulted in death too			1
' @entity18 was cited in seven cases we have found			0
of course there may have been more , but we are limited to the surviving records			0
' from what we have read , football seems to have been a violent sport , played in a similar way to @entity18 nowadays but without the protective clothing			1
' @entity282 was also very dangerous			2
few people could swim and there was a high number of accidental drownings during the period			2
' the records can also tell us a great deal about people ’s lives , including when they took part in sport or recreation			1
' for example , six out of the seven deaths from football occurred in february while most of the archery accidents happened in may , june or july			1
' accidents involving football , wrestling or throwing games were more likely to happen on a sunday than a working day or holiday			0
' it is all part of a wider project into accidental deaths in the 16th century , which we hope will lead to a better understanding of everyday life at that time			0
