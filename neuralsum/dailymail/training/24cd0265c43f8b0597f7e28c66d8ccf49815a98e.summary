@entity1 ' @entity0 returns with the latest installment of his weekly column for @entity4			0
the @entity6 boss does not hold back with his views on current issues in football			1
@entity10 needs his @entity11 what an absolute farce the situation at @entity13 with @entity10 has become			1
there 's only one thing that man wants â€“ and that is more money and a longer contract			2
it was rubbish what his agent @entity22 said about him being unhappy that the club did not celebrate his birthday			0
there 's no doubt he is top quality and top class , and without him @entity13 would not have won the @entity31			1
exit : @entity10 wanted to leave @entity13 after claiming that nobody wished him happy birthday evidence : @entity13 said that @entity10 did receive a cake on the plane on their post-season tour influence : toure was instrumental in @entity13 winning the @entity31 this season but why his agent did n't just go and knock on @entity43 's door to negotiate another year and a further pile of wedge is beyond me			1
the conduct and behaviour of some of these agents is quite despicable			0
at 31 , @entity10 has no resale value and i would love it , really love it , if @entity13 told him he was not going to get a new contract , point out he 's got a deal in place at the moment and tell him get on with it			1
he can take his birthday cake and stick it where the sun does n't shine			0
the @entity59 there is an interesting situation developing at my old club @entity62			2
how will it evolve there ? the board are now taking more responsibility for signings and have ordered a change in the style of play and the introduction of a new attacking coach			1
is an attacking coach one who concentrates on technical finishing skills in and around the 18 - yard box , or do you give him a bag of balls , the bibs and the discs and let him dictate the style of play of the team ? brief : @entity84 has been told @entity62 must play a more attractive style of football next season for me , you defend as a team , and defend from the front			1
and you attack as a team , starting from the goalkeeper and going through all the players in your squad			0
does the attacking coach make decisions on where the full - backs pass it to retain possession or look for penetrating diagonal and forward passes ? does he work with the back four , the midfield four , the one in the hole , who at the moment is @entity105 , and the big man up front @entity106 ? back in the swing : @entity109 has been lined up for a role as attacking coach at @entity112 it will be very interesting to see if this works , or if it turns into a catastrophe			0
there will certainly be interesting discussions at the @entity62 training ground this summer			2
@entity121 's @entity120 i only ever managed one cup final and that was for @entity121 in 1986 against @entity125 at @entity126 , on a sunday afternoon , in front of almost 91,000 people			1
we lost , i was the worst player on the pitch and got substituted after a shocking display			0
my legs just would not move and the occasion proved too much for the young pup i was at the time			0
we are going up : @entity121 beat @entity136 at @entity126 in the @entity138 play - off final on saturday hero : @entity140 scored the winner in injury time to send @entity121 back to the @entity31 glory : @entity121 's fans celebrate their promotion in the @entity126 sunshine the @entity121 fans left early on the day , leaving the blue and white end of @entity126 virtually empty			1
sitting on the bench , having been substituted , i shook my head with tears in my eyes knowing i had let them all down			0
to see those fans on saturday , when they won promotion back to the @entity31 , singing and celebrating for what can only be described as daylight robbery , was very special			1
hopefully that makes it up to all of those fans who made the trip in 1986 that i so badly let down , and can finally put that one bed			2
my week ... for three weeks it 's been non-stop negotiation with an agent to sign a centre forward for the season ahead			2
his name is @entity170 , we signed him from @entity172			2
he 's big , he 's strong , he 's powerful and hopefully he will do the business			0
however , he 's getting married this weekend and is off on his honeymoon to @entity175			1
unrest : protesters confront soldiers in riot gear during a city centre anti-coup rally in @entity181 concern : @entity0 hopes his new striker @entity170 avoids danger on his honeymoon in @entity175 now , after seeing the reports on the news about the goings on in @entity181 , where the army are clashing with protesters , i 'm starting to get a little concerned			1
i 'm sure he will have a wonderful time , but it 's not the most ideal place to visit at the moment and i 'd like my new striker to be terrorising defences for me next season			0
as a manager you always hope players do the right thing through the summer break and i 'm just keeping my fingers crossed that he comes back in one piece .			0

@entity10 's agent should have knocked on @entity43 's door to negotiate a new contract rather than behave the way he did
@entity62 's board are taking more responsibility for signings and want a better style of play
after my @entity126 *heartbreak* in 1986 , it was nice to see @entity121 players and fans celebrating promotion back to the @entity31
new @entity6 striker @entity170 is going to @entity175 for his honeymoon
