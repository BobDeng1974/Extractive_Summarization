@entity0 wants to do @entity1 a favour and wreck @entity4 's title party			1
@entity4 need just one point against the @entity6 to seal a second @entity8 trophy in two years			1
@entity10 's side beat @entity11 4 - 0 on wednesday night to capitalise on second - placed @entity1 allowing a 3 - 0 lead to slip at @entity13 to draw 3 - 3			1
but while @entity0 recogises the lethal threat @entity4 face , he points out that his @entity6 side can play with complete freedom			2
' it will be hugely difficult : they 're the best team at home in the league			0
their goal record is fantastic and they 've got great players			0
' but every ( @entity6 ) player can go and give his best because we know we 're safe in the @entity8 , so let 's go and spoil @entity4 's party			1
' the under - fire @entity6 boss also wants to win to see @entity1 clinch a first title in 24 years , should they win their match against @entity49			1
he also revealed that he would like to see @entity51 talisman @entity50 lift the one trophy which has eluded him			0
he said : ' i think at this moment in time , from a neutral 's point of view , i think everybody would like to see @entity1 win it			0
from a personal point of view i 'd like to see @entity50 win it			2
down and out : but @entity0 wants to see @entity1 captain @entity50 win the league ' it 's the last thing he has n't quite achieved for @entity1 , but obviously they 've let it slip out of their hands			1
on form and where they are , @entity4 are the favourites			0
' huge credit to @entity10			0
it 's his first season and if he does win the @entity8 and the @entity71 means they 've done the double			2
' there 's not much more you can ask from a manager , no matter how much money has been spent			0
everyone knows this league is the hardest league to win in the world			0
' no 1 : @entity0 paid credit to @entity4 boss @entity10 's first season in @entity83 football better than evens : @entity4 have a 53.4 per cent chance of scoring the three or more goals they need to become the highest scorers in a @entity8 season			1
