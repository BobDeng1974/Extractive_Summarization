by @entity0 published : 08:20 est , 22 march 2012 updated : 08:58 est , 22 march 2012 the mystery has deepened around the @entity4 ' bird man ' who posted a video showing a successful ' test flight ' of a wing suit contraption			2
no one seems to know ' @entity9 '			2
his @entity11 biography links to @entity12 , a workplace which has no record of him - and there is also no record of @entity18 at @entity19 , which also appears on his cv			1
@entity9 lifts off - powered only by a run up and the flapping of the wings , without a rocket or a rotor in sight the engineer 's suit is made from a 200 square foot ' kite ' , powered by motorised wings which ' amplify ' @entity9 's arm movements @entity9 takes a run - up for his test flight			1
the 31 - year - old engineer claims that he ' flew ' 300 feet and stayed in the air for a minute @entity9 's invention uses accelerometers and motors to ' amplify ' the flapping of his arms @entity44 ' video provoked controversy online , with many viewers claiming that it must be faked			1
@entity48 has been very difficult to contact since he posted the video this week , and has not spoken publicly			0
the video shows a flight in a park in the @entity54 , which lasted about a minute			0
@entity4 engineer @entity48 runs through a park in the @entity54 flapping enormous , kite - like wings - and suddenly ' lifts off ' , flying 300 feet through the air			1
@entity48 claims to be the first human being to fly like a bird , without a jet or rotors - instead , he says he uses wings which ' amplify ' his muscles , with the motion sensors from @entity65 's @entity64 transferring motions into motors in the wings			1
the 31 - year - old engineer claims that wireless engines in the wings work as ' amplifiers ' for @entity9 's own arms , allowing him to flap wings that would otherwise be far too large for a single human			1
the technology is plausible - in theory			1
but effects experts have called into question whether @entity9 ' attempt is authentic			0
‘ they ’re able to afford to build this thing , but ca n’t invest in proper video equipment , or a tripod , ’ @entity77 , technical director at @entity80 's @entity79 and magic effects house said in an interview with @entity83			0
‘ if i were to make a fake video with the intention of going viral , i would make certain that the quality was as poor as possible to disguise any flaws in poor animation work			0
‘ i am suspicious because there is not much detail shown of the actual machine , ’ he says			0
‘ the device is also something that is only possible in recent times , given proliferation of these types of high torque , high power density brushless motors , high voltage speed controllers and lithium batteries , off the shelf carbon fiber components and so on			0
' @entity9 claims that the ' suit ' is driven by @entity64 motion sensors in the arms which ' sense ' the pilot 's movements , helped by an accelerometer from an @entity114 smartphone			2
the movements are transferred into @entity117 motors which give @entity9 the power to move the 200 square foot wings ' ever since i was a little boy i have been inspired by pioneers like @entity123 , @entity124 , said @entity48 in a press release along with the video			0
@entity9 ' lifts off ' in a bird suit built from 200 square foot kite wings with motors in the wings that ' amplify ' his flapping smeets in triumph after his successful ' test flight ' - the engineer is sharing his techniques openly online so others can build their own ' wing suits '			2

@entity19 and *companies* where he claims to have worked have no record of ' @entity18 '
technology plausible - but signs of fakery , says @entity150 expert
