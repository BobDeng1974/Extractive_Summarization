it was the anthem which propelled @entity1 into @entity2 with a landslide majority for @entity4			1
but popstar - turned - astronomer @entity5 admits he would not lend his smash hit song , @entity9 , to help @entity11 's election bid			1
the popular professor warned he can not see a ' clear direction ' from today 's @entity14 , in stark contrast to 1997 when ' everybody supported @entity1 '			1
it proved so popular that the @entity27 tried to stop @entity28 playing the anthem because the band gave their royalties to the @entity14			0
while mr @entity11 has sought to draw a line under the @entity1 era , @entity4 struggled has under mr @entity11 to get the public dancing to his tune			1
at his first conference speech after becoming leader , he walked on to stage to a-punk by @entity39 , but he has failed to find a signature song since			0
@entity5 , pictured left in his popstar heyday , said he would say no if @entity11 asked to use one of his songs again cos plays keyboards on stage with @entity20 : @entity21 , the @entity48 pop group , who secured their first number one hit with @entity9 in 1994 now @entity5 has suggested mr @entity11 has failed to impress even those who backed mr @entity1 two decades ago			1
asked if he would allow @entity9 to be used by @entity4 again , he told the @entity51 : ' i 'd probably say no to labour using the song — there are immense pros and cons to all the parties and i ca n't quite see a clear direction			1
' it 's very different now than in ' 97			0
in ' 97 , it was obvious that everybody supported @entity1			1
but now i think it 's complicated , it 's a muddy political climate			0
i 'm sort of apolitical intentionally , because i 'm rather a single - issue person , so it 's definitely not clear - cut			2
' he stresses that he has not decided which way to vote and would be influenced by the tv debates - if they happen			0
but asked if he is more of a fan of @entity1 than @entity11 , he eventually conceded : ' in 1997 , i would have said @entity1 , but i think @entity1 made some mistakes			1
so now i 'd say @entity11 because @entity1 cocked up			2
' @entity9 reached number one in 1994 , and was re-released in 1997 , when it climbed to 19 in the @entity75 charts			2
the song became the soundtrack of @entity4 's election victory in 1997 which propelled @entity1 into @entity79 mr @entity11 's leadership has come under increasing pressure in recent days , with senior party figures from the @entity1 era warning he is failing to make an impact ahead of the election on may 7			1
@entity86 warned mr @entity11 's plan to impose a mansion tax is ' crude ' and would end up ' clobbering ' people			1
@entity90 and mr @entity91 , two senior @entity92 , accused the @entity4 leader and shadow chancellor @entity94 of failing to defend the economic record of the last @entity4 government			2
@entity97 , a former home secretary who served in @entity1 's @entity98 , said voters did not believe @entity4 would be any better than the coalition			1
he told @entity101 : ' the reason why [ minor parties have ] gained support is because people do n't think the @entity106 , @entity107 are good and they are not confident enough that @entity4 will do better			0
' @entity4 's challenge is to ensure that we convince people that we would do better			2
@entity111 , who left @entity112 in 2010 after turning around the company 's fortunes , has branded @entity11 a ' 1970s throwback ' , in a damning blow to the @entity14 ' in a general way , i think that investment and reform , which was our slogan in the @entity1 years , is crucial			1
certainly , the party has to campaign on the @entity122 , but it also has to campaign on education , which is another story of investment and reform			0
' it has to campaign on transport , it has to campaign on policing and a whole set of other issues			0
' mr @entity11 has also come under fire from business leaders , in stark contrast to the way mr @entity1 wooed captains of industry to reassure them about a @entity4 government			1
former @entity112 boss @entity111 claimed @entity4 ’s ‘ business - bashing ’ could curb investment and lead to ‘ shuttered shop fronts , empty high streets and lengthening dole queues ’			2
his intervention is especially significant because he was handpicked by @entity143 to advise him directly as prime minister			0
it follows criticism from @entity148 chief @entity147 who suggested a @entity4 government would be a catastrophe			2
mr @entity11 has launched a fightback , vowing to ' stand up to these powerful forces ' and accusing the @entity153 - based mr @entity147 of being part of an ' unholy alliance ' with the conservatives against change			0
voters would not ' take kindly to being lectured by someone who is avoiding his taxes on how they should be voting in the @entity75 general election ' , mr @entity11 suggested			0
@entity164 mayor @entity163 defended mr @entity147 's right to speak out , but added it was ' disappointing ' that he had moved @entity167 to @entity168 to reduce its tax liabilities - prompting @entity4 to challenge @entity170 and @entity171 to join in the criticism			2
meanwhile , shadow chancellor @entity94 was attempting to build bridges with industry , saying that while there would always be some business leaders who took a ' political view ' on issues including taxation , the majority would back the party 's policies on infrastructure , education and remaining in the @entity185			1
mr @entity94 , responding to claims that a ' bitter war of words ' had erupted between his party and business , said : ' the reality is there 's going to be some issues in any society which become very divisive politically , and understandably			0
' the level of taxation that you levy at any point of time , there will always be different views on that , and whether or not we should have a health service which is predominantly free or whether people pay			0
' these are big political issues			0
here are always going to be some people in every community , including the business community , who take a political view			0

@entity215 keyboardist who backed @entity1 is less convinced about @entity11
@entity9 was soundtrack of @entity4 's 1997 landslide
@entity5 says ' everybody supported @entity1 ' but there is no ' clear direction ' today
senior figures from @entity1 government have rounded on @entity11 's policies
business leaders also warn @entity4 is now a throwback to the 1970s
