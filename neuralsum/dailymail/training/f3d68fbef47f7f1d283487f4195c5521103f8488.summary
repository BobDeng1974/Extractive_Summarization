@entity0 admits that @entity3 's @entity2 victory in @entity4 21 years ago took his own reputation to the next level			1
now he believes the current crop of @entity9 stars can do the same this weekend			1
@entity0 was only 19 when his solo try helped @entity3 to a 20 - 14 victory in front of 54,000 people at @entity14 – now the @entity15 - in 1994			1
one of the @entity17 commentators suggested at the time : ' they will make him the mayor of @entity3 after that '			1
looking back this week , the former @entity3 winger said : ' it 's true that my reputation and standing in the game was different because of that match			1
if you can perform in a match like that then it immediately earns you respect			2
@entity0 ( right ) played more than 300 times for @entity3 before switching to union in 2000 @entity0 was a huge hit in union and scored a superb try in @entity39 's 2003 @entity2 final triumph ' it was an incredible occasion back then , one of the highlights of my career			1
the fact that we won , did wonders for me and for the game over here			2
' this year 's @entity49 is being played as a series			1
@entity9 winners @entity52 face @entity55 champions @entity54 at @entity56 on sunday but , prior to that , on friday night and saturday , @entity51 face @entity58 and @entity3 entertain @entity59 once again			1
the new concept has attracted some scepticism but @entity0 believes the three games offer the @entity64 game the opportunity to prove a point			1
' this weekend is so important , ' he added			2
' three games between some of the biggest clubs in the game			2
what 's not to like about it ? this is an enormous opportunity for @entity9			1
@entity54 captain @entity74 take a pass in training as his side prepare to face @entity52 ' being a top player in @entity9 does not mean you are a big player in the world			1
but if you can put on a good show in games like this – especially if you win – than that changes			2
' will @entity4 fear @entity3 , for example ? no , they wo n't			1
' but @entity3 can give them a big surprise just like we did 20 years ago			1
that then begins to change things does n't it ? ' this is the opportunity for current @entity3 players – and players at @entity51 and @entity52 – to write their own little bit of history			1
' it would mean an awful lot to our game if we could do well this weekend			0
it generates immediate respect overseas			0
' when you hear people talk , they all say that the @entity55 is the ultimate league			1
maybe we can show them this weekend that the gulf is n't that big after all			0
@entity106 , brother of union convert @entity108 , makes a strong run during @entity54 training on wednesday ' as a player , in order to grow you have to be taken out of your comfort zone			1
our teams will prepare this week maybe with a bit of fear factor			0
they will know they could get a hiding			0
' but they also know they have a chance to come out the other side with their reputations enhanced			0
that is the one of the motivational factors for them			0
' personally , i think something good could happen for them this weekend			0
rugby in this country will find out exactly where it stands this weekend and i am optimistic			0
' @entity0 played more than 300 times for @entity3 before switching to @entity136			1
he won a @entity137 in 2003 with @entity39 but still rates the 1994 @entity49 success as one of his career highlights			1
also in the @entity3 team that night were legends such as @entity143 , @entity144 and @entity145			2
current sky analyst @entity146 and @entity148 coach @entity147 also played			2
on saturday at the @entity149 , @entity0 will be present with many of his team - mates from that night in @entity4 to see if @entity153 's current side can repeat the triumph			1
@entity0 is tackled by @entity156 flanker @entity155 during the @entity158 semi-final ' back then , to even go to @entity17 at the age of 19 was quite a big thing for me , ' he recalled			1
' but playing in that stadium , the pressure that we were under , the difficult style of play , that all added to the occasion			0
' it was funny really because when we got there , we were immediately told to kick back a bit and take it easy			0
so we had a couple of nights out and maybe we let our hair down a bit too much ! ' but then the reality kicked in			0
we were a good team and had just had a great year at home			2
' but this was still a huge test for us			0
they could have taken us to the cleaners and we knew it			0
' that threat was always there			0
the @entity17 had always set the levels			0
' the players they had in their team were exceptional			0
@entity190 , @entity191 , @entity192 , for example			0
these guys were serious players			0
' but they key to it was the fact we knew – we believed – we had great players too			0
we went out there with that attitude and that was really important			0
@entity3 will be without skipper @entity202 ( centre ) for their clash against the @entity59 ' we started well and got on the front foot and that was so important			1
we set our levels high in that game right from the start			0
' i was lucky enough to score a try in the game and , for me , that was amazing			0
' it 's nearly 21 years ago but the memories are still there			2
it remains a career highlight for me			0
' this weekend @entity3 will be without skipper @entity202 , who has a knee injury			2
@entity3 also have the memories of a disappointing defeat in their corresponding game against @entity224 in @entity17 a year ago to contend with			1
' that will have hurt @entity3 a lot , ' said @entity0 , whose 20 - year - old son @entity227 is on @entity3 's books			1
' but @entity153 will have them fired up for this , no doubt about that			0
' @entity232 is big for @entity3 but they have @entity233 back so that 's a boost for them			1
' @entity227 has his head down and is working hard			0
he has not played many games but that 's because the standard is so high			2
' @entity3 have a lot of very good young players			2
it 's tough to get in that team			2
' tickets for the @entity245 clash between @entity3 and @entity59 are available from the @entity246 , ticket hotline 0871 6633 552 and online at @entity249			1
