@entity0 lowered against a black background , and with a frown creasing his brow , this portrait of @entity3 captures the great man at his lowest ebb			2
it is a far cry from the iconic images of @entity11 's charismatic wartime leader in his trademark bowler hat , holding his fingers in a ' v ' for @entity16 sign , or puffing on a fat cigar			0
but @entity19 's haunting portrait is the one @entity3 himself treasured most , with the then 41 - year - old describing it as ' the picture of a man 's soul '			1
' haunted soul ' : the artist @entity19 captured @entity3 in his political ' wilderness years ' in the wake of the disastrous @entity29 @entity3 sat for artist @entity19 in 1916 – as @entity11 was counting the human cost of the disastrous @entity29 the then @entity31 had championed the year before			1
@entity33 artist @entity19 was an official war painter of the @entity34 , producing renditions of privates , dead soldiers and @entity38 as well as official portraits of generals and statesmen			1
@entity3 sat for @entity19 on 11 occasions in 1916 , an experience the artist is said to have found tense and difficult given the state of mind of his subject			1
nonetheless , the final work met with the approval of @entity3 , who upon seeing the painting is said to have told @entity19 : ' it is not the picture of a man			1
it is the picture of a man 's soul			2
' the suffering @entity19 witnessed during his time as a war painter is said to have affected him deeply , and critics have attributed an occasional ' shallowness ' in his portraits to emotional exhaustion in the wake of the @entity34			1
the artist was made a knight commander of the @entity65 ( @entity66 ) in the 1918 king 's birthday honours list			0
he died in @entity68 aged 53			0
having crashed out of @entity69 , he likely suspected his hitherto glittering political career would never recover			0
that the catastrophe weighed heavy on @entity3 's shoulders is evident from the gloom that permeates the portrait , and the artist described his subject as a ' man of misery '			1
but @entity3 - who would go on to earn his place in history as arguably the greatest @entity65 prime minister - said @entity19 's painting captured a glimpse into his very soul			1
upon seeing the piece , @entity3 is said to have told the artist : ' it is not the picture of a man			2
it is the picture of a man 's soul			0
' the rarely seen life - size painting - which hung for years in the home of @entity3 's late grandson - is now on display to the public in the @entity97			1
the @entity68 gallery unveiled its new addition this week after securing the painting on a 10 - year loan from @entity3 's estate			2
aside from a brief period on display at the @entity105 in 2005 , the ' deeply personal ' portrait has remained within the @entity3 family			2
the @entity97 said the painting captures a ' moment of crisis ' in @entity3 's career			1
@entity110 , director of the gallery , said : ‘ i am very pleased that the @entity3 family has agreed that this outstanding portrait by @entity19 of @entity3 , the nation 's greatest 20th century statesman , should now be on public display			1
’ the portrait is displayed prominently in the early 20th - century room , illustrating @entity3 ’s significance in the context of the @entity34 , the gallery said			1
@entity120 : iconic images of the indomitable ' @entity122 ' are far removed from the more vulnerable side of @entity3 captured in @entity19 's portrait up to the dark hour captured in @entity19 's portrait , @entity3 's path to success had been relatively smooth			1
born into the aristocratic family of the @entity128 , as a young man he joined the @entity130 and proved his talent as a writer - attracting acclaim as a war correspondent			0
he made his first foray into politics as @entity138 mp in 1900 , rising swiftly to hold several senior positions before being appointed @entity31 under @entity141 's government in 1908			0
it was in this position that , after war broke out in 1914 , @entity3 pushed for the @entity29 that would end in disaster and the loss of thousands of troops			2
in november @entity3 put forward his plans for a naval attack on @entity150 in @entity151 , a move based at least in part on what would turn out to erroneous reports regarding @entity157 troop strength			0
the attack - designed to open up a path for the @entity130 to invade the @entity29 peninsula and go on to take the @entity157 capital @entity161 - was opposed by military chiefs , but @entity3 argued successfully for the plan to go ahead			2
losses : @entity65 , @entity166 and @entity167 troops in the @entity29 landing at @entity169 on april 25 1915 a joint @entity65 and @entity171 campaign was duly mounted to secure @entity161 - now @entity172 - and secure a sea route to @entity174			0
there was a delay of more than six weeks before many of the troops arrived from @entity11 , allowing @entity157 forces time to prepare defences for a land assault , and the landing date of april 25 was leaked in advance			0
@entity185 troops sustained devastating losses during the landings as the @entity157 furiously defended every inch of their soil			0
the attack then lost momentum after the initial landing with most troops remaining on , or not far from , the beaches , thus allowing the @entity157 time to bring in reinforcements			0
the campaign rolled on but @entity185 troops to achieve their initial objective proved unsuccessful and casualties mounted			0
in the wake of the failed @entity205 the campaign - increasingly unpopular with the @entity65 public - entered a hiatus period and @entity185 soldiers were eventually evacuated			0
by the close of the campaign in january 1916 more than 200,000 @entity185 troops had been killed			0
at the time of @entity19 's portrait @entity3 was preparing to defend himself against charges of reckless and incompetent leadership before the @entity214			1
the @entity214 went on to conclude that he was not personally responsible for the failure of the mission , and @entity3 eventually returned to the political front line at the outbreak of the @entity219 , going on to be widely regarded as one of the great wartime leaders of the century .			2

@entity19 's portrait of @entity3 at a ' moment of crisis ' has gone on display at the @entity97
upon seeing the painting , @entity3 is said to have told the artist he had captured his soul
at the time of sitting in 1916 , @entity3 was haunted by the catastrophic failure of the @entity29 he championed in the @entity34
