a ‘ smart ’ scalpel that instantly sniffs out cancerous tissue has been created by scientists			1
by accurately distinguishing between healthy tissue and tumours , the ‘ magic wand ’ could revolutionise cancer surgery			1
patients would have to undergo fewer operations , be left with smaller wounds , and have a greater chance of survival			1
use of the @entity13 could also allow surgeons to tackle operations currently deemed too risky to attempt use of the @entity13 could also allow surgeons to tackle operations currently deemed too risky to attempt			1
the device ’s inventor , dr @entity18 , of @entity20 , said : ‘ it has been long - recognised that it would be nice to have a real - time identification of tissue , kind of a magic wand			1
one could touch the tissue and it would immediately tell what kind of tissue it was			2
‘ the @entity13 provides a result almost instantly , allowing surgeons to carry out procedures with a level of accuracy that has n’t been possible before			1
it has the potential to reduce tumour recurrence rates and enable more patients to survive			0
’ more than 300,000 cases of cancer are diagnosed in the @entity36 each year – leading to almost two million operations			2
the @entity13 is a combination of two existing pieces of equipment , which tells the surgeon as he cuts through the flesh if it is diseased but even the best surgeons can not be sure of removing the entire tumour			1
this can lead to the disease returning or mean the patient needs a second operation			0
at present , cancer surgeons use scans carried out before the operation to guide them as they cut into the patient			2
during the operation , they can also send a sample of tissue to the laboratory to confirm if it is cancerous or healthy			1
but this is expensive , time - consuming and , crucially , the results are not always accurate			0
dr @entity18 ’ solution is the @entity13 , a combination of two existing pieces of equipment , which tells the surgeon as he cuts through the flesh if it is diseased			1
the first piece of equipment , an electric scalpel , is already routinely used in operations to sear through flesh			2
as it does this it produces smoke , which is usually sucked away by extractor fans			0
dr @entity18 realised the smoke is valuable because it contains information about the flesh that was burnt away			0
so he used a tube to collect the smoke and pass it to a mass spectrometer			0
it analyses the smoke and by comparing its chemical make - up with the make - up of known tumours , it can tell if the tissue was cancerous or not			1
the results then flash up on a screen next to the surgeon			0
some analyses take less than a second			0
in a study involving operations on 91 cancer patients , it proved to be 100 per cent accurate , the journal @entity92 reports			2
the device is already being used in three @entity98 hospitals , as part of a larger study			0
if it is as successful as hoped , it could be in widespread use in two or three years .			0
