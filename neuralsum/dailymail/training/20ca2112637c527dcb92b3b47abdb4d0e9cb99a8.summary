by @entity0 many men with erectile dysfunction currently face a difficult decision - they can either accept a less satisfying sex life or they can take @entity5 and put up with the side effects			1
and these are the lucky ones - millions of men with sexual function problems do not even have the option of taking @entity5 as it is not suitable for people with angina or those who have had a stroke or a heart attack			2
but , there could soon be another option for the millions of men with erectile problems			0
a new cream which is currently being trialled in the @entity20 could eventually replace @entity5 tablets a @entity20 biotechnology company is trialling a cream which could improve sexual function without causing side effects			1
@entity26 and @entity27 has completed the first phase of clinical trials of the cream , @entity23 , which has the same active ingredient as @entity5			2
the cream is applied directly to the man 's genitals where the drug passes through the skin and into the tissue , in a bid to improve sexual function			1
the trial revealed that the cream causes far fewer side effects than @entity5 tablets and the researchers say that any recorded side effects were mild			2
in contrast , @entity5 is known to cause side effects including nausea , headaches , facial flushing and an upset stomach			1
@entity5 can also not be taken by men with bleeding problems , angina , kidney problems , liver problems or those who have had a heart attack or a stroke			0
the cream has the same active ingredient as @entity5 but does not cause the same side effects the researchers gave some of the volunteers the cream while a control group were given @entity5			1
tests revealed that the levels of the active ingredient - sildenafil - in the blood were more than 20 times lower in the patients who had used the cream than in those who had taken @entity5			1
' with a growing concern about systemic side effects associated with the current oral forms of @entity71 - 5 inhibitors , a topical treatment approach such as @entity73 could enable patients with [ erectile dysfunction ] to benefit from a local therapeutic dose of sildenafil directly into the penile tissue while reducing the risk of unwanted systemic side effects , ' said dr @entity80 , director of sexual medicine at @entity82 and director of @entity84			0
' [ this is a ] novel delivery technology to positively impact sexual health in both men and women			0
' the researchers do accept , however , that their tests are yet to confirm whether the cream actually improves sexual function			0
all their clinical trial as so far proved is that it is safe for use and that it does pass into penile tissue when applied directly to the skin			0
erectile dysfunction is estimated to affect 13 to 20 per cent of men between the ages of 40 and 80 .			0

the cream - @entity102 - 6006 - is being trialled by a @entity20 biotechnology company
it contains the same active ingredient as @entity108
it is applied directly to the man 's genitals so does *n't* cause side effects
@entity5 can cause nausea , facial flushing , headaches and stomach upsets
men with heart problems are also unable to take the drug
