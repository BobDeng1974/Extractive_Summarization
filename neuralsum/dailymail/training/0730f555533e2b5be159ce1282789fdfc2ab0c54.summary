glass half full : @entity1 are cutting down on their drinking , according to industry figures @entity1 have dramatically reduced how much they drink , cutting back over the last decade by the equivalent of 110 glasses of wine a year or 73 pints of beer			1
drinking – at home as well as in pubs and clubs – has fallen by some 18 per cent since a peak in 2004 , against a background of rising prices driven by inflation - busting increases in tax and duty , according to industry figures			1
the fall calls into question the image of @entity1 as a nation of heavy drinkers and lager louts			2
indeed , the official handbook from the @entity26 points out that @entity1 drinking is an average of 25 per cent below the level in @entity30 and 15 per cent less than in @entity31			1
the fall appears to be part of a major cultural shift that has also delivered drops in alcohol - fuelled crime and vandalism			1
the @entity26 figures show drinking peaked in 2004 with annual consumption of 9.5 litres of pure alcohol			1
this is equivalent to 404 pints of 4 per cent beer or 604 small ( 125ml ) glasses of wine			2
there were falls in seven of the following nine years with the total down to 7.8 litres in 2013			2
that is equivalent to 330.8 pints of beer or 494.4 glasses of wine			0
the figures , which use information from @entity53 and the @entity54 , cover pubs as well as shop - bought drinks			1
while the trends point towards a permanent change in attitudes for the research also shows that today ’s teenagers are taking a far more adult approach to drinking than earlier generations			2
in @entity65 in 2013 , some 39 per cent of 11 - 15 year olds had never drunk alcohol , which was sharply down compared to 43 per cent in 2012 and 61 per cent in 2001			1
among those youngsters who had a drink in the last week , average weekly consumption was 8.2 units , which is equivalent to less than three pints of beer and is well down on the 12.5 units in 2012			2
the fall in total consumption will be one of the factors behind the crisis facing the nation ’s pubs with evidence showing that they are closing at a record rate of 31 a week , despite efforts to build trade by offering more and better quality food			0
change : the fall appears to be part of a major cultural shift that includes drops in alcohol - fuelled crime the @entity26 figures show drinking peaked in 2004 with annual consumption of 9.5 litres of pure alcohol , which is only a small proportion of the beer or wine in each glass			1
the 9.5 litres is equivalent to 404 pints of 4per cent beer or 604 small ( 125ml ) glasses of wine - 11.6 a week			1
there were falls in seven of the following nine years with the total down to an average of 7.8 litres in 2013			0
that is the equivalent to 330.8 pints of beer or 494.4 glasses of wine , which works out at around 110 fewer a year			0
@entity108 is likely to be major factor , for the cost of drink in @entity1 is among the highest in @entity112 after successive governments increased duty and tax at above the rate of inflation under pressure from doctors and the police as part of a policy to tackle binge drinking			1
the current chancellor , @entity124 , has rowed back a little on this by making cuts to beer duty			0
however , the @entity1 still has among the highest drink taxes in @entity112 , which work out at around 53p on a pint of beer or £ 2.36 on a bottle of wine			2
the @entity26 ’s chief executive , @entity133 , said : ‘ despite the recent cuts in beer duty , @entity1 ’s consumers are still subject to some of the highest tax rates for beer in the @entity140			1
let ’s hope we see another tax cut next year			0
’ shift in opinions : the drinks industry claims a more responsible approach to selling and marketing drinks earlier this year , the government implemented a new policy requiring stores to stop using cut - price alcohol to tempt customers through the doors by introducing a new regime banning them from selling drink at less than the cost of duty plus vat			1
the drinks industry claims a more responsible approach to selling and marketing drinks , which was triggered over the rise of alcopops in the mid- 1990s , has helped reduce problem drinking among the young			1
in the 1990s and early 2000s , the sugary and powerful drinks like @entity167 and two dogs triggered a wave of underage drinking			1
however , sales have since collapsed			0
at the same time , the industry is now promoting a raft of lower alcohol options			0
for example , @entity175 and @entity176 are marketing wines with 5.5 per cent alcohol , while the @entity182 ’s @entity181 and @entity180 , which are just 2 per cent , are selling well			2
miss @entity133 said : ‘ it ’s great to see trends in alcohol harms coming down , showing that investment by the industry and partnership with @entity148 , through targeted measures , is having a positive impact			0
’ the @entity191 ( @entity191 ) has sounded the alarm over pub closures and has called for urgent changes to planning rules to help protect what are important community buildings			0
specifically , it wants to make it harder for supermarkets to buy and convert pubs into convenience stores			0
spokesman , @entity203 , said : ‘ popular and profitable pubs are being left vulnerable by gaps in @entity65 planning legislation as pubs are increasingly being targeted by those wishing to take advantage of the absence of proper planning control			0
‘ it is utterly perverse that developers are able to demolish or convert a pub into a convenience store or many other uses without any requirement to apply for planning permission			0
' it is wrong that communities are left powerless when a popular local pub is threatened with demolition or conversion into a @entity225 store			0

figures *released* in annual handbook of the @entity26
we drink 18 per cent less than in 2004 - and less than @entity30 and @entity31
but government *'s* figures also *suggest* underage drinking is on the rise
