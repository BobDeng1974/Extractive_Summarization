separated parents who refuse to pay child maintenance will face the threat of being declined credit such as mortgages , credit cards and mobile phone contracts as a result			1
under new government plans , from next march parents across @entity9 who fail to keep up with contributions towards their child ’s upbringing will risk of harming their own credit rating			1
arrears built up in the child maintenance system will potentially have the same impact on a non-payer ’s credit score as other debts where someone has defaulted on their payments			1
new scheme : separated parents who refuse to pay child maintenance will face the threat of being declined credit such as mortgages , credit cards and mobile phone contracts as a result having a weak credit rating can mean people are refused forms of financial credit such as personal loans , mortgages , credit cards , hire purchase finance arrangements and mobile phone contracts			1
the government plans to introduce new powers which will enable the @entity41 and the @entity42 to start sharing certain information from their clients ’ payment records with credit reference agencies			1
this data can then be used by financial firms to help them decide whether or not they want to offer someone credit			0
determined : child maintenance minister @entity53 said the government will take action to stop a minority of parents being able to get away with not paying maintenance even if someone is not rejected outright for credit , a blotted history could mean that they are given a smaller credit limit and are charged a worse rate of interest than they might otherwise be eligible for , as financial firms see that person as more “ risky ”			2
information about non-payment of child maintenance would potentially be shared with credit reference agencies at the point where a liability order is made against a parent			1
liability orders take place in a small minority of child maintenance cases			2
they are granted after an application is made to a court for legal recognition of a debt			0
the process involves informing parents before the application is made			0
just under 1.5 million child maintenance cases are being overseen by the @entity41 and the @entity42 and in the majority of cases , parents who no longer live in the family home do contribute towards their child ’s upbringing			1
between april 2013 and march 2014 , 12,410 liability orders were granted			0
the new powers , which are subject to parliamentary approval , will also mean that parents with a good payment record can ask that this information is shared if they feel that it could boost their ability to get credit			0
the @entity104 already has existing contracts with credit reference agency @entity106 and the new powers will be exercised as an extension of this relationship			2
child maintenance minister @entity53 said : ' for too long , a minority of absent parents have got away with failing to pay maintenance , leaving families without that financial support			2
this government is determined to take action to tackle this kind of irresponsible behaviour and support families			0
' i would hope that we see this power used very little , because the deterrent effect of a possible negative mark on a person ’s credit rating will convince those who have previously failed to pay towards their children ’s upbringing to do the right thing			1
' the @entity41 was introduced in 2012 and it will eventually replace the @entity42 , which is gradually closing its cases over the next three years			2
the government 's latest plans for changes to the rules highlight the number of ways your rating can be affected negatively			0
so having a good handle on your credit history - and ensuring there are no mistakes - is important			0
