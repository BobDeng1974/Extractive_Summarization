a quarter of the population are classified as obese by @entity2 published : 09:57 est , 21 february 2013 updated : 05:15 est , 22 february 2013 many overweight people are suffering from ' fat blindness ' , say experts @entity7 are increasingly suffering from ' fat blindness ' and are failing to lose weight until they are obese , experts have warned			1
only when the scales tip 13st 10lb does the average person decide that enough is enough , new figures show			2
and seeing unflattering photographs is the first things that stirs us into action			1
statistics from @entity19 , which records the start weights of all new members - primarily women , but also some men - reveal the average start weight has risen steadily from just over 12 stone in 1989 to 13st 10lb today , an increase of more than 10 per cent			1
in @entity29 ( @entity29 ) terms , the average new member 's reading has increased from 29.2 to 32			2
this means that the average new @entity19 member , of whom there were more than 850,000 in the @entity7 last year , is now already obese by the time they join			1
a quarter of the population has a @entity29 which classifies them as obese ( a reading of 30 to 34.9 ) compared with 11 per cent ten years ago			1
this steady weight gain over the last 20 years , and our inability to acknowledge when we reach an unhealthy weight , supports the government 's findings that obesity is rapidly becoming a primary health and economic threat for our modern society			2
in fact , over 90 per cent of people in a recent independent study struggled to identify an obese body			0
even more alarming is that 68 per cent of obese people questioned did n't even know they were obese			0
inspiration : looking at unflattering photos can be the final straw alarming figures released yesterday by the @entity58 show that 65 per cent of men and 58 per cent of women now classed as overweight or obese			2
@entity61 , @entity62 at @entity19 said : ' the inability to recognise what an overweight or obese body looks like , is a symptom of how out of touch we are with a healthy weight and shape			1
' we 're suffering from " fat blindness " , which is causing people to delay seeking help until they are significantly overweight			0
according to @entity19 , members top seven triggers for losing weight are : unflattering photos poor health friends or family losing weight not wanting to be fat for a milestone birthday wanting to keep up with children or grandchildren being called names in the street getting married ' where obesity was the exception , sadly it is rapidly becoming the rule			1
' it 's time to buck the trend			0
we 're here to help people make a positive change in their lives by teaching them to make smarter , better informed food choices for long term , sustainable weight loss			1
' though losing weight may be daunting , especially for those with a significant amount of weight to lose , dropping just 5 - 10 per cent of your body weight can significantly improve your health			0
' ms @entity61 added : ' it 's natural to judge ourselves based on comparisons of those around us			0
' so unfortunately , the more people who are overweight and obese , the more ' normal ' it becomes			0
' this phenomenon helps to make being overweight much more acceptable , reducing any pressure to make healthy lifestyle changes or seek support			0
' it may also mean those who are overweight fail to recognise they have a problem with their weight at all			0

average ' trigger ' weight has risen more than a stone in a decade , according to @entity19
unflattering photographs are a key weight loss trigger
a quarter of the population are classified as obese
