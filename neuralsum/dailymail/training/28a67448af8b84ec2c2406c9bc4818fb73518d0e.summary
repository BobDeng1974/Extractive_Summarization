defence chiefs have attempted to block the production of a new film about the death of a @entity5 soldier in @entity6 – because it portrays how the @entity8 botched a rescue mission			1
corporal @entity10 died in september 2006 after becoming stranded in an unmarked minefield during a mission against @entity14 fighters near the strategically important @entity15 in @entity16			1
but tragedy struck when a @entity19 helicopter sent to rescue @entity20 and other @entity5 soldiers set off mines in the area as it attempted to land , causing him fatal injuries and injuring others			1
corporal @entity10 died in 2006 after becoming stranded in an unmarked minefield during a mission against @entity14 fighters the @entity30 was heavily criticised at the inquest into @entity20 ’s death in 2009 , with the coroner saying officials should ‘ hang their heads in shame ’ over the failure to send a properly equipped aircraft			1
now the incident has been depicted in a new film , @entity42 : a @entity43 , which will be released next month			1
the movie , which stars @entity46 actor @entity45 as a medic who tries to save @entity20 , is backed by @entity48 and other military charities which will receive a percentage of the box office takings			2
but the makers have told @entity53 that they were blocked in their attempts to research key parts of the story , because @entity30 officials refused permission to speak to any of the air crew involved			1
@entity20 , 27 took command when two paratroopers at the front of a patrol were blown up by mines			0
he sent a radio request for a helicopter equipped with a winch to lift the wounded to safety			0
@entity20 also warned the helicopter should not attempt to land in case the downdraught from its engines caused more explosions , the inquest said			1
but this instruction was ignored and instead a chinook without a winch was sent , which led directly to his death and to more paratroopers being wounded			1
producers from @entity82 wanted to understand every aspect of the incident , including why the @entity19 crew seemingly ignored @entity20 ’s attempts to wave it away			1
last night , @entity89 sources confirmed the @entity30 turned down repeated requests to speak to officers aboard the helicopter that day			0
survivors : @entity94 ( right ) was on the minefield with @entity20 when disaster struck			2
he is pictured with colleague @entity97 at @entity98 the film is poised to shock cinema audiences with its retelling of how @entity20 and his fellow paratroopers were let down by military officials			1
disabled troops who recently competed in the @entity105 – a sporting festival set up by @entity107 – are expected to attend the premiere on november 12			2
they will meet @entity20 ’s parents , who are fully behind the movie even though they admit they may find some of the scenes too shocking to watch			0
last night , the soldier ’s father @entity112 , 67 , from @entity114 , said he hoped makers had got over obstacles put in their path by @entity89 officials			2
‘ they were n’t trying to bring the @entity30 down in any way , they ’re just trying to show the bravery of the guys , ’ he said			0
‘ we ’re excited and nervous			0
i ’m not going to watch the whole film , but i may go in for the start			2
if it gets too heavy i ’ll come out			0
’ the @entity53 was given an exclusive preview of the film which portrays the events of september 6 , 2006			1
on that day , @entity20 and colleagues from the @entity132 , the @entity133 ( @entity132 ) became trapped in a minefield which was not marked on their maps			1
with his colleagues @entity138 and sgt @entity140 lying in agony after being blown up , @entity20 , played by @entity137 , sends an emergency radio message requesting a helicopter should be dispatched to lift them out of the minefield			1
but @entity5 commanders tell @entity20 no @entity5 helicopters fitted with the necessary equipment are available			0
instead , they suggest he should move the casualties to an area where it would be safe for the @entity19 to land			1
as the soldier explains , this is not an option due to the number of mines			0
the film then recreates the tragic moment when a twin - rotor @entity19 hovers over @entity20 , the wounded paratroopers and the medic , @entity162			1
the @entity19 produces powerful blasts of air and – just as @entity20 had warned – more mines explode			1
as the dust settles , @entity20 is seen lying on the ground , his gaping wounds and charred face providing a harrowing reminder of the reality of war			0
gasping for breath and in excruciating pain , he continues to issue orders to his colleagues , six of whom are now wounded			2
he insists they should not allow themselves to sleep because this will accelerate their physical decline			0
‘ no snoozing boys , ok ? ’ he croaks			0
it takes commanders six hours to send @entity189 @entity188 helicopters fitted with winches to rescue the casualties			0
in the film , this period is boiled down to a harrowing 45 minutes as @entity20 and his colleagues desperately fight their injuries			1
a tear - jerking scene based on the testimony of survivors of the incident sees @entity20 tell ‘ @entity162 he can feel himself getting colder			2
fearing the onset of death , he issues a series of requests about his fiancee @entity205 and family , which make for gripping viewing : ‘ @entity208 i love her			2
tell her to marry someone else and to be happy			0
tell my parents to have a big party with a cash - free bar			0
tell them i was a good soldier , tell them i died like a good @entity133 ’ desperately , @entity162 seeks to reassure @entity20 that he will pull through , but by the time the @entity189 helicopters arrive he is only just clinging to life			2
in a selfless gesture typical of @entity20 , one of his last actions is to offer words of support to a casualty who is in a much better state than himself			0
at the time of his death , he was preparing to marry ms @entity205 , his fiancee of nine years			2
she has followed the wishes of her former partner and has since married and is now a mother of two children			0
for his actions that day , @entity20 was awarded a posthumous @entity232 , the @entity5 ’s highest award for bravery not in the face of the enemy			0
sgt @entity140 was awarded the @entity238 and @entity239 the @entity240			0
at an inquest held into the causes of @entity20 ’s death , coroner @entity241 made a withering attack on the @entity30 the inquest heard the helicopter did set off the mine which killed @entity20 while the coroner highlighted three factors which caused his death – the downdraught from the @entity19 , the lack of appropriate @entity5 helicopters fitted with winches , and the delay in sending a suitable helicopter			1
other criticisms included the failure of the officer responsible for passing updated information about the mine threat being unable to interpret the maps , and that local knowledge had been ignored			0
@entity20 ’s death also led to the @entity8 fitting @entity19 helicopters with winches			1
a @entity30 spokesman said last night : ‘ it is untrue to suggest the @entity30 has withdrawn its support or attempted to block the @entity42 film in any way			1
we agreed to provide a specific amount of support to this project and we honoured that agreement			0
