by @entity0 @entity1 is already renowned for copying @entity3 goods from trainers to champagne			1
now it is building a replica reputation in the world of architecture , with miniature versions @entity10 , the @entity13 pyramids and the @entity14 - to name a few - springing up all over the country			1
the reproduced structures — also dubbed ' duplitecture ' — can appear bizarre to outsiders but make sense to many in the country			2
' i think it 's a good thing			0
i can see things from places that i ’ve never been , ' said a man surnamed @entity25 , 32 , sitting in a @entity27 park scattered with sculptures including @entity29 , @entity30 and the gigantic heads of four @entity33 presidents			1
fabricating the @entity34 : people walk past a copy of one of the pyramids of @entity39 at a theme park in the @entity42 city of @entity27 and here 's the real thing : @entity45 is seen in front of the @entity47 in @entity39 , @entity48 , iconic landmarks which have inspired architecture in @entity1 elsewhere in the southwestern city , a set of curved white buildings under construction have sparked controversy for their striking resemblance to a @entity59 development by star @entity61 architect @entity60			1
@entity63 was ' something @entity1 does ' , a retired judge said as she walked past the site , adding : ' i think it ’s a good thing — we can learn from the experience of others			2
' the director of @entity60 's @entity59 project was less positive , reportedly calling the property company ' pirates '			1
the company has denied copying , telling news agency @entity78 that it had reached an agreement with the original developer , which declined to comment the ' duplitecture ' trend developed alongside @entity1 ’s real estate boom in recent decades , especially for creations conveying prestige and success , said @entity86 , the @entity87 - based author of @entity88 : @entity89 in @entity1			1
a slice of the @entity91 : a theme park in @entity27 features a condensed version of the famous @entity87 skyline as @entity1 builds a reputation for replicas the real @entity14 skyline : a 27 - year - old woman surnamed @entity99 , who walked past the fake @entity87 in @entity27 , said her compatriots should embrace their own heritage among the most eye - popping examples are a copy of the @entity106 alpine village and @entity107 of @entity108 in the southern province of @entity110 , which even the official news agency @entity111 called ' a bold example of @entity1 ’s knock - off culture '			1
an assemblage of @entity116 monuments including the @entity117 and a fountain from @entity119 stand in @entity120 , as does a @entity122 village			0
@entity124 province has an imitation @entity45 , while outside @entity126 sits @entity127 , an @entity128 - themed suburb featuring a statue of @entity130 , a church from @entity132 and lookalikes of guards at @entity135			0
the imitations are open to mockery , but @entity86 says that such replicas provide an easy way to convey prestige on a huge scale			0
cut down to size : a replica of @entity10 featuring @entity33 presidents ( l - r ) @entity145 , @entity146 , @entity147 and @entity148 in @entity27 towering landmark : the original features 60ft heads carved into the granite face of @entity10 in @entity153 , @entity154 , in the @entity33 ' in the @entity33 , we see people who copy as unimaginative thieves			0
in @entity1 copiers have been viewed with more nuance — copying can be a sign of skill and it can also just be a really practical solution to a problem , ' she told @entity78			1
' developers wanted a way to brand their developments and the home owners wanted a way to brand their lifestyle and their economic success			0
' and one of the easiest solutions to that was to copy architecture that was most emblematic of a kind of aristocratic and ' sophisticated ' - seeming lifestyle , ' she said , citing @entity119 , @entity179 and the @entity180 as popular models			0
that pragmatic streak also drives the mass production of knockoffs including @entity186 handbags , @entity188 watches , @entity122 wine , @entity191 films and @entity192 , while the southwestern city of @entity194 once even hosted a fake @entity195			0
in @entity202 , part of the boom town of @entity200 next to @entity201 , an army of artists duplicate masterpieces ranging from @entity204 to @entity205			0
@entity206 of @entity1 : a woman walks along a replica of the @entity42 landmark at a park in @entity27			1
the reproduced structures are known by some as ' duplitecture ' as far as the eye can see : the original @entity215 is a series of fortifications that stretch for some 21,000km across the country the fakes allow @entity42 to enjoy what they could not otherwise afford , said a young man strolling at an amusement park in @entity27 featuring a miniature @entity87 , @entity179 - like canals and @entity224 ’s @entity226 statue rotating atop a ride			1
' in terms of respecting others ’ creativity , it ’s not okay			0
but for a @entity1 that ’s still developing , for a certain time there ’s a use for it , ' he said			2
' when @entity1 ’s economy becomes developed enough , then there wo n’t be a market for copied goods			1
' even so , the rampant imitation raises questions of national pride in a country boasting a rich history and now regaining global clout			0
in march , @entity247 president @entity246 urged his countrymen to ' refrain from copying @entity250 architectural styles and work harder to promote local culture ' , @entity111 paraphrased him as saying , while itself warning of an ' eerie copycat architectural landscape '			0
' @entity253 ' : these curved buildings in @entity27 have sparked controversy for their striking resemblance to a @entity59 development by star @entity61 architect @entity60 design theft : the director of @entity60 's @entity59 project ( above ) reportedly described the property company building a similar version in @entity264 as ' pirates ' as @entity1 rises in stature and wealth , it will increasingly seek inspiration from within , said @entity86 , adding that already ' there seems to be a new confidence and interest in their own indigenous styles '			1
at the park with the @entity10 replica , a man in his 20s surnamed @entity279 argued that @entity1 's neighbours mimicked its culture when it held greater sway in the past , and would do so again as the country reclaims the stage			1
' if people have something good then we will copy it , ' he said			0
' this is something every country , every society does , not only @entity1			2
' but a 27 - year - old woman @entity99 , walking past the fake @entity14 with a friend , said her compatriots should embrace their own heritage			0
' it seems like @entity42 people have this view that anything foreign is good , that anything with @entity128 writing , whether or not they can read it , is good , ' she said			2
' @entity1 is not inferior to anyone , but nobody really cares a lot about @entity1 ’s ancient past			2

the rise of so - called ' duplitecture ' trend has developed alongside @entity1 's real estate boom in recent decades
replicas seem strange , but @entity42 citizens say they allow them ' to see things from places they *'ve* never visited '
