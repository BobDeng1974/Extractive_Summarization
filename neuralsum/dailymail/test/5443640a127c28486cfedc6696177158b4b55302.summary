it seems an accepted trend that @entity3 midfielder @entity2 struggles during the second half of the season and the @entity7 midfielder was one of the worst players on the pitch again in his country 's 2 - 0 defeat by @entity12 on tuesday			1
the 27 - year - old spoke of his happiness in south west @entity15 earlier this week but his form has significantly dipped from that of the player who , around @entity19 , looked a dead - cert to break the @entity22 record for assists			2
on tuesday - his first international appearance since october - he was given just four out of 10 by one @entity7 newspaper and while his season is likely to end in success with the @entity22 title following a @entity32 win , questions remain about @entity2 ' durability			2
@entity2 ( right ) captained @entity34 on tuesday but his poor form continued as they lost 2 - 0 in @entity12 the @entity3 midfielder struggled to make an impact in midfield as the @entity40 champions fell to defeat after a brilliant start to the season at @entity46 , the @entity43 's form has dropped off somewhat of late ' i 'm playing almost every minute of every match ( with @entity3 ) and that 's what makes me happy , ' he said this week			1
but a long , intense campaign on his return to @entity52 is taking its toll on the @entity43			0
@entity3 manager @entity53 will have been concerned to see his player toiling in midfield for the full 90 minutes at the @entity56 , adding to the fatigue that seems to have seen his role as a key man in the @entity61 ' title charge decline of late			2
@entity2 captained the @entity40 champions in the @entity63 capital but struggled to make any real impact against @entity66 's @entity65 or goalscorer @entity67			0
@entity53 will be demanding more from his deep - lying playmaker in the @entity22 run - in @entity69 and @entity2 enjoyed a great start together and linked up again in @entity3 's 3 - 2 win at @entity72 @entity2 was brilliant for @entity3 in their big win away at @entity75 in january but has struggled since after his Â£ 30million transfer to @entity3 last summer , @entity2 ' former club @entity76 released a statement that pointed at his traditional @entity80 slump			1
' there has been a downward trend in his stats every season at the club , ' it read			0
' despite glowing starts to each campaign , @entity2 's contributions to the cause gradually decreased as each season drew to a close			0
' from being someone who joined in with the attack , supplying and scoring goals , the magic tended to fade later on in each season			0
' and it seems to have rung true on the stats front			0
having picked up 15 @entity22 assists by mid-january , he has just one in five games he has played since , and just four in 15 appearances for club and country in 2015			1
@entity106 's record of 20 had looked almost certain to fall but given his current form , @entity2 is now on track to fall just short			1
however , with nine games to play @entity3 are still to face six opponents who their key man in midfield has laid on goals against			0
@entity2 ' former team - mate @entity106 ( right ) holds the record for assists in a @entity22 season @entity106 managed 20 assists in the 2002 - 03 season and @entity2 looked set to beat that haul before his slump when he left @entity76 , the club commented on @entity2 ' unwanted reputation for a late - season slump their opponents on saturday , @entity126 , as well as @entity127 , @entity66 , @entity128 , @entity129 and @entity130 have all been opened up by @entity2 ' passing ability this season , while he scored in @entity3 's 2 - 0 win over @entity134 in october			1
the personal accolade will be important to the midfielder , but more key is the boost it could give to his club			0
@entity3 could need as many as six wins from their remaining nine games , and if @entity2 finds form again the @entity22 title could be wrapped up within weeks			1
@entity53 will hope his assist for @entity69 in @entity3 's last game against @entity72 is a sign of a late - season resurgence to prove any doubters wrong			2
@entity2 laid on an assist for @entity69 in @entity3 's 3 - 2 win over @entity72 , but that was his first in five games @entity53 is looking to guide his team over the line in the @entity22 title race , with @entity2 a key cog			1

@entity2 ' poor form continued for @entity34 against @entity12 on tuesday
@entity3 midfielder captained his country but they lost 2 - 0 in @entity56
if his form goes on he will not match @entity22 assists record
@entity106 's mark of 20 in 2002 - 03 is four more than @entity2 ' total
a resurgence in his form could help his club wrap up the @entity22
