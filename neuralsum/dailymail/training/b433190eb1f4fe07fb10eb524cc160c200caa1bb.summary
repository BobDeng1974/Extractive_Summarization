passport giveaway : a law introduced in 2011 has allowed an extra 550,000 @entity3 residents to apply for @entity5 nationality and , with it , the right to live anywhere in @entity9 a little - known loophole has enabled half a million people from some of eastern @entity9 ’s poorest countries to obtain @entity5 citizenship and , as a consequence , a @entity17 passport			1
a law introduced in 2011 has allowed an extra 550,000 @entity3 residents to apply for @entity5 nationality and , with it , the right to live anywhere in @entity9 – including @entity23			1
the ‘ passport giveaway ’ was intended to enable people whose ancestors lived in the former @entity26 to claim citizenship			1
but the system has also attracted applicants who admit they have little emotional attachment to @entity5 and only tenuous ancestry			1
for some people in eastern @entity9 ’s poverty - stricken nations , the scheme presents a chance to escape to wealthier countries such as @entity23 , @entity37 and @entity38			1
yesterday a report by @entity41 ’s chief inspector of @entity42 and @entity43 , @entity44 , said the ‘ @entity46 citizenship route ’ was becoming ‘ an increasingly important way into the @entity23 for those whose origins lie outside the @entity50 ( @entity50 ) ’			1
his report looked at more than 100 sample cases from the @entity54 between april and september last year			2
it found that more than a third of @entity46 nationals applying for citizenship for their partner were born outside the @entity17			1
the @entity5 passport giveaway is just one route			2
in neighbouring @entity63 alone , 112,000 new passports were issued between 2011 and the end of march this year			1
thousands of @entity63 residents are eligible for citizenship because the northern province of @entity68 belonged to @entity69 until 1918 when @entity5 – allied with @entity37 – lost the @entity70 and was forced to hand over two - thirds of its territory			1
all applicants need is a basic command of the language and @entity5 ancestry – and for many the benefits of applying are obvious			2
the average salary in @entity63 is £ 5,200 before tax , compared with £ 26,500 in @entity23			2
in the @entity63 town of @entity81 , on the @entity5 border – one of dozens of centres where applications are processed – more than 12,000 @entity63 were granted @entity5 citizenship last year			1
@entity5 ’s general consul in @entity81 , @entity87 , admitted many @entity63 citizens applied for @entity5 citizenship merely ‘ to travel more easily with a @entity5 passport ’			1
‘ i do not condemn that in any way			2
everyone looks after his own interests , ’ he said			2
outside the consulate in @entity81 earlier this year , the @entity93 interviewed several @entity63 residents as they emerged with their yellow certificates declaring them @entity5 citizens			1
lorry driver @entity98 , 47 , admitted he applied for dual nationality ‘ so i can move to the @entity23 ’ , where he will earn five times his £ 5,000 - a - year salary			0
floodgates : a report by her majesty ¿ s chief inspector of @entity42 and @entity43 , @entity44 , said the ' @entity46 citizenship route ¿ ' was becoming ' an increasingly important way into the @entity23 for those whose origins lie outside the @entity50 ( @entity50 ) ' struggling to support his wife and 15 - year - old daughter on his meagre wage , he trawled @entity46 recruitment websites and found ‘ many jobs ’ for @entity116 drivers in @entity23			1
‘ @entity117 is a nice country and it will be a new challenge for me			0
i can not make a good life for my family here , ’ he said			0
in the town centre , there is a large poster advertising an @entity128 language school with the motto , ‘ money is coming ’			0
@entity131 , 56 , said her son moved to @entity133 , @entity134 , to work in a factory last year after obtaining a @entity5 passport			0
she said : ‘ the [ @entity5 ] law is a very good thing			1
in a couple of years , i think there wo n’t be any borders – @entity117 , @entity63 , @entity5 , it wo n’t matter , you will just go where you can find a job			0
’ applicants for @entity5 passports must prove that they have ancestors ‘ who were @entity5 or lived on the territory of @entity150 and can prove it by death or birth certificates ’			0
however , the vague language requirement , which states simply that you ‘ know the language ’ , is open to exploitation			0
there is no exam or standardised list of questions , so it is down to busy clerks in individual offices around @entity63 and @entity5 to assess the skills during a brief meeting			0
the @entity54 admitted it had no way of monitoring how many of the 500,000 new @entity5 citizens had made their way to @entity23			0
a spokesman said its @entity17 migration figures did not include a breakdown of people ’s country of origin			1
@entity175 and @entity176 have introduced similar laws to @entity5 , offering national status to people living in @entity3 states such as @entity181 , @entity182 , @entity63 , @entity183 and @entity184			1
under fire : @entity187 chief executive @entity186 ministers were accused of ‘ profiting from the public ’s hardship ’ last night after it emerged the shambolic @entity192 is making £ 13 profit on every document issued			0
mps said that , instead of the government raking in £ 73million in surplus every year , the money should be poured into tackling the backlog of 480,000 outstanding passport applications that is threatening to wreck family holidays			0
the @entity192 was forced to admit a profit margin of more than 20 per cent under pressure from the @entity204			0
in figures sent to mps , under - fire chief executive @entity186 said the average cost of processing each application was just £ 59.40 – compared with a standard price of £ 72.50 for a passport			0
he also released statistics which revealed ministers and officials should have realised as early as january this year that the service was heading for a crisis as there were 552,192 applications compared with only 482,356 in january last year			0
the chaos has led to a huge increase in staff overtime , on rates of up to £ 70 per hour – with almost £ 1million being spent in may alone			0
almost three quarters of countries will not accept @entity23 passports that have been given 12 - month extensions under plans to alleviate the backlog in applications , it has been revealed			2
home secretary @entity230 last week announced that expat @entity23 who need to renew their passports would be given one - year extensions			0
but now the government has admitted only 50 countries have confirmed they will accept the extended passports , with the @entity236 , @entity237 and @entity238 not on the list .			2

law introduced in 2011 has allowed 550,000 @entity3 residents to apply
gave citizenship to residents of former @entity26
system also attracted those who have little emotional attachment
allows people to escape to wealthier countries , including @entity37
