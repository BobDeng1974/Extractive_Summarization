by @entity0 published : 05:40 est , 28 january 2013 updated : 10:39 est , 28 january 2013 images of what is believed to be parts of the forthcoming @entity4 have emerged online for the first time			1
@entity6 are said to have been preparing several new versions of its iconic smartphone this year , including a cheaper , plastic - bodied model aimed at customers in emerging markets			1
the need for the company to diversify its offerings was underlined yesterday by a report which showed that the @entity4 is losing its appeal among well - heeled @entity18 customers			1
is this the first look at the next iphones ? the image purporting to show the speaker parts from the forthcoming @entity23 and @entity4 6			1
the same part from the current generation is shown not to scale and the leaked images come as rumours began circulating that @entity6 is also readying a new version of its @entity29 with @entity30 of storage - a potential direct challenge to @entity34 's @entity33 , which launches in the @entity35 next week			1
the photos , which the editor of @entity39 tech blog @entity37 said he found ' while browsing the web ' , show speaker components which are similar to ones used in the @entity44			1
they were apparently leaked online by an employee of the @entity48 company which manufactures the parts for the @entity51 tech giant			2
the rather fuzzy images purport to show the block speaker parts which will be used on the @entity23 and @entity4 6			1
both parts appear to be similar in design to the part currently used in @entity23 , but the one thought to be for the @entity4 is slightly smaller			1
it is speculated that this could actually be designed for the as - yet hypothetical @entity60 , an @entity61 or a possible budget iphone			0
there have been rumours that @entity6 is preparing a cheaper version of its @entity4 for emerging markets , where demand for the smartest of smartphones has been hampered by its rather smart price - tag			1
but stiff competition at the top end of the market by tablet / smartphone hybrids like @entity76 's @entity75 has also led to rumours that the company could also be readying a larger version			2
the same parts are shown from above : the fuzzy images were apparently leaked online by an employee of the @entity48 company which manufactures the parts for the @entity51 tech giant while it is not possible to tell for certain whether the photos are indeed legitimate leaks of @entity4 parts , @entity85 has published a number of accurate photos in the past			1
the writer claims the source of the images , whose identity he has chosen to keep secret , told him the @entity23 is set for launch between march and july , while the @entity4 will be unveiled at the year 's end			1
that matches the predictions of a recent analyst 's report , which said production of the upgraded version of the @entity44 will begin in march for a june release			0
@entity6 is reported to preparing a @entity30 version of the @entity29 , which would be perfectly positioned to take on the latest top - of - the - line pro version of @entity34 's surface tablet			2
the forthcoming fourth - generation @entity6 tablet with a retina display would not be a redesign of current models but rather an addittion to the current line , sources told @entity117			2
it will join the @entity119 , @entity120 , and @entity122 fourth - generation @entity121 which @entity6 already has on the market			0
no price has yet been released			0
it comes after @entity34 last week announced it was to market a pro version of its surface tablet in @entity128 from next week			0
powered by an @entity130 x86 - type processor , the @entity33 will run a full version of the latest @entity132 , allowing it to use fully featured @entity134 software rather than the slimmed - down apps currently available for @entity136 that has allowed @entity34 to position the gadget as a complete laptop replacement			0
it comes in both @entity122 and @entity30 versions but , unlike @entity6 's tablets , does not have a sim slot to enable connection to mobile networks			2
the expectation that @entity6 is preparing to expand its so - far one - dimensional smartphone range comes as analysis of mobile web traffic from @entity149 and @entity150 showed consumers there are turning away from its products			0
driven by a combination of @entity4 fatigue , a desire to be different and a plethora of competing devices , users in these influential markets are turning to other brands , @entity155 reported			2
in @entity150 , @entity6 's products were so dominant in 2010 that more devices here ran its @entity168 operating system per capita than anywhere else in the world			0
but @entity171 , which measures traffic collected across a network of 3 million websites , calculates that @entity6 's share of mobile devices in @entity29 and @entity4 - declined sharply last year			1
from a peak of 72 per cent in january 2012 , its share fell to 50 per cent this month , while @entity180 devices now account for 43 per cent of the market , up from 20 per cent in the same month last year			0
in @entity149 , devices running @entity6 's @entity168 now account for about 30 per cent of the total , down from about 45 per cent a year ago			2
@entity180 accounts for nearly two - thirds			0
' @entity6 is still viewed as a prestigious brand , but there are just so many other cool smartphones out there now that the competition is just much stiffer , ' said @entity189 , chief executive of @entity150 - based @entity190 , which develops a popular regional social media app called @entity192			0
where @entity149 and @entity150 lead , other key markets across fast - growing @entity195 usually follow			0
' @entity150 and @entity149 tend to be , from an electronics perspective , leading indicators on what is going to be hot in @entity200 and @entity128 , as well as what is going to take off in the region , ' said @entity203 , who runs a @entity150 - based company called @entity205 developing mobile apps for enterprises .			0

@entity210 images purport to show speaker block component from forthcoming @entity4 6 and @entity23 models
@entity214 comes amid rumours that @entity6 is *intending* to release several new versions of its iconic smartphone this year
next generation of the tech giant 's *flagship* gadget expected to be joined by a cheaper version , a bigger version and / or a smaller version
need to diversify offerings underlined by stats showing @entity4 is losing its appeal in influential @entity18 markets
