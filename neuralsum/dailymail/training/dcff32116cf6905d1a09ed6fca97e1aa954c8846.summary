by @entity0 published : 15:33 est , 3 july 2013 updated : 12:18 est , 4 july 2013 she really put her leg into @entity3 ! @entity5 lower leg and foot had to be amputated after a car she was rebuilding fell and crushed it			1
despite the traumatic injury , @entity5 decided to get creative and made a prosthetic out of @entity3 blocks that were laying around in her basement			1
scroll down to see video ... how it all begins : @entity5 with her regular prosthetic and notice the box of @entity3 to the left no instructions here : the prosthetic off , @entity5 sets about building a new leg made from @entity3 progress : with the box of @entity3 all over the floor , @entity5 sets about building the toy limb it fits : the @entity3 bricks seems to fit perfectly around @entity5 's stump ms @entity5 , an occupational therapist and clinical researcher based in @entity31 , @entity32 , said she decided to build the toy leg after a co-worker proposed the idea as a joke			1
' i liked the idea , because i am very comfortable with my body and like encouraging others to be more comfortable with theirs , ' she told @entity41			2
as she set about creating the plastic limb , she recorded a video to document her work			2
in the time - lapse video , ms @entity5 is seen dumping out crate after crate of @entity3 blocks and sorting through them as she builds , fits and tests her own prosthetic leg			1
caring : @entity5 has launched a @entity53 page where she shares videos , resources and healthcare information for other amputees and caregivers the final piece : @entity5 attaches the foot and ankle that she has built feeling pleased with herself : finally the leg is complete and @entity5 is surely worthy of the title of @entity3 ' @entity65 ' the moment of truth : after two days , @entity5 completes building her leg and gingerly tests whether it will take her weight whoops ! the ankle and foot do have a tendency to snap off now and again ! nothing afoot here : the foot can easily be reattached with minimal effort passion for engineering : @entity5 lost her leg when she was fixing a car and it crushed it but she still loves getting her toolbox or box of @entity3 out ! near the end of video – which runs just under six minutes – she stands up on her multi-coloured prosthesis and cautiously steps on it a few times			1
the film which is set to music is sped up in order to condense the two day building blitz into just under six minutes			0
she says that it only took about two hours to fit the @entity3 limb to her leg			2
the video has received nearly 325,000 views on @entity94			0
she has also launched a @entity53 page where she shares videos , resources and healthcare information for other amputees and caregivers			0
she says although the leg is colorful and comfortable , it 's not completely practical			2
the ankle and foot tend occasionally snap off , but all it takes is a click to put it back together			1
as a result , she can walk for only short distances on it			0
@entity5 warns her viewers that the @entity3 prosthetic is not actually meant to be used			1
' please do n’t do this yourself			0
i do n’t want you to fall and get hurt ! ' she said			0
' sometimes you just need to be silly			0
' @entity114 : @entity5 says the @entity3 leg is n't particularly practical or comfortable but is proud she accepted the challenge ms @entity5 says she is planning ' @entity117 2.0 , ' on which the ankle and foot will be far more functional			1
either way , there 's no doubt her positive outlook on life ensured that her creativity prospers			0
' i like having this extra space below my stump that other people do n’t have that i can explore , ' @entity5 said			2
' it makes me feel superhuman .			0
