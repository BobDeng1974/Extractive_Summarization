the sexual fantasies of modern women have been revealed in a new book by sex writer @entity15 ... and there are five main groups the post- @entity33 era book is a compendium of private stories and innermost thoughts from hundreds of women			1
as publishers @entity40 comment : ' female sexual fantasy began in 1973 with @entity9 's multi-million - selling collection of real women 's fantasies , my @entity44			1
' until that book was published , female sexual fantasy did not exist ; not even within the pages of @entity51 , their opinion at the time being : " women do not have sexual fantasies , period			1
" ' friday 's book changed all that			1
now , exactly forty years on from friday 's masterpiece , leading sex writer @entity15 is curating a brand new female fantasy classic for the modern era			1
@entity15 , who who edits online erotica site @entity63 , told @entity65 writer dr @entity65 of the @entity66 : ' i wanted to bring attention to female fantasy and remind women that the idea that women have a private sexuality is a recent sexual freedom - and not something to be taken for granted or brushed under the carpet			1
' her interviews in the book - released by @entity40 publishers on 12 september for Â £ 10.99 - are with modern women , and exposed five main areas of female sexual fantasy : submissive fantasies , dominant fantasies , exhibitionism and voyeurism , group sex , and partner fantasies			1
dr @entity65 explains the groups here			0
exhibitionism and voyeurism both appear on the list of women 's five main sexual fantasies @entity94 fantasies of this nature vary from simply being tied - up to the bed all the way through to having a formalised sex contract complete with rules about which way you look , in the vein of @entity104 and @entity104 in @entity104			2
props such as whips , handcuffs , gags and blindfolds are common in this type of fantasy			0
submissions could be emotional or physical and may involve role - play - in some cases even going as far as pretending to be a rape victim or a sex slave			0
@entity119 ' erotic trilogy @entity104 has been credited with more women enjoying the idea of a sexual experience that involved them being submissive towards a man dominant fantasies when the roles are reversed and the man becomes the submissive to the female dominatrix			2
role - play includes cheating on a partner and being in control of a sex slave			0
with research suggesting it 's very popular , and almost a third of people report having these fantasies at some point , the ( sometimes literal ball - buster is a very popular role indeed			2
the fantasy is about the woman being in control of what happens in bed and inflicting both pleasure and pain as she sees fit			0
more and more women are relishing the idea of playing a dominatrix ordering around a submissive man in bed @entity150 and @entity151 whether you 're doing it in the garden , the park , on an aeroplane , in the stationery cupboard at work or simply beside an open window in your own home , the idea of being somewhere where you could get caught or even be watched is a big turn - on for women			2
indeed , women in the book talk about the secondary eroticism of watching others having sex , and the excitement of being intimate when you know for certain you are being watched			2
the idea of watching people having sex or being watched yourself is one of the top turn - ons for women with so much going on when you have sex as part of a group , many women relish the idea of being very , er , well - looked			0
there is also an element of anonymity in some cases , or , if you are part of a couple , bringing something new , different and exciting into the bedroom			0
for others the idea of experimenting with your sexuality by engaging intimately with a member of the same sex is where the fantasy lies			0
many women are aroused by the idea of having sex as part of a group , whether because they are keen to experiment with their sexuality or because they want to add another person 's sexual nuances to the mix quite simply , the idea of having sex with a loving , exclusive partner really gets women hot under the collar			2
similarly , the idea of regular sex with a specific partner who is not your own is also a fantasy , for example a celebrity , a friend , or a work colleague crush			0
many women fantasise simply about regular sex with a partner - whether that partner is their own or one they like to dream about being intimate with			0
