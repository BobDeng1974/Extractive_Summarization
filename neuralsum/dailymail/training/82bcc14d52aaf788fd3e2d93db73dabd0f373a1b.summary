@entity3 's planet - hunting @entity1 telescope is broken , potentially jeopardisng the search for other worlds where life could exist outside our solar system			1
if engineers ca n't find a fix , the failure could mean an end to the £ 400 million ( $ 600 million ) mission 's search - although @entity3 says it may still be able to save the ailing telescope			1
the telescope has discovered scores of planets but only two so far are the best candidates for habitable planets			0
@entity1 is a space observatory launched by @entity3 to discover @entity22 - like planets orbiting other stars			1
data from @entity1 could help humans find alien life the kepler space telescope orbits around the @entity28 , 40 million miles from @entity22			1
it is named after @entity31 astronomer @entity30			0
it was launched in 2009 with the sole purpose of finding new stars and planets			0
during that time it has confirmed 132 planets and spotted more than 2,700 potential ones			0
in december 2011 , @entity30 found a new @entity22 - sized planet orbiting a star just 352 light years away			2
it was found lurking in the @entity1 star field and was named @entity1			2
its parent star , the hd 179070 , is so close it can be viewed with a home telescope			0
however , @entity3 scientists said there ’s very little chance of it hosting life because the surface is a @entity54 ( @entity55 )			2
@entity1 's mission was supposed to be over by now , but last year @entity3 agreed to keep @entity1 running through 2016 at a cost of about £ 13 million ( $ 20 million ) a year			1
according to @entity3 scientists , there is , what 's dubbed , a ' @entity60 ' in space where the temperature is not too hot , or too cold , for water to exist in liquid form			2
any planets found in this zone could have life on them			0
if @entity1 is retired , @entity3 scientists believe the search for other lives on planets could be severely hindered			1
' i would n't call @entity1 down - and - out just yet , ' said @entity3 sciences chief @entity73			1
@entity3 said the spacecraft has lost the second of four wheels has stopped working			1
these four wheels control the craft 's orientation in space			0
with only two working wheels left , it ca n't point at stars with the same precision			1
in orbit around the sun , 40 million miles from @entity22 , @entity1 is too far away to send astronauts on a repair mission , in the same way @entity73 and others fixed a mirror on the @entity91			1
over the next several weeks , engineers on the ground will try to restart @entity1 's faulty wheel or find a workaround			1
the telescope could be used for other purposes even if it can no longer track down planets			0
@entity30 was launched in 2009 in search of @entity22 - like planets			2
so far , it has confirmed 132 planets and spotted more than 2,700 potential ones			0
its mission was supposed to be over by now but last year , @entity3 agreed to keep @entity1 running through 2016 at a cost of about £ 13 million ( $ 20 million ) a year			1
last month , @entity1 scientists announced the discovery of two distant planets that scientists believe have the ideal environments to harbour life			0
this is the space telescope @entity30 's field of view , superimposed on the night sky so that the main stars are visible			0
in its four - year history , @entity30 has confirmed 132 planets , and found 2,700 new ones			1
some of the discoveries may harbour life the other planets found by @entity1 have n't fit all the criteria that would make them right for life of any kind of life - from microbes to man			1
while ground telescopes can hunt for planets outside our solar system , @entity1 is much more advanced and is the first space mission dedicated to that goal			2
for the past four years , @entity1 has focused its telescope on a faraway patch of the @entity136 hosting more than 150,000 stars , recording slight dips in brightness - a sign of a planet passing in front of the star			2
now ' we ca n't point where we need to point			1
we ca n't gather data , ' deputy project manager @entity145 told @entity147			1
scientists said there 's a backlog of data that they still need to analyze even if @entity30 stopped looking for planets			0
' i think the most interesting , exciting discoveries are coming in the next two years			0
the mission is not over , ' said chief scientist @entity155 at the @entity156 in @entity157 , which manages the mission			0
scientists who have no role in the @entity1 mission mourned the news			2
@entity3 engineers preparing the @entity1 for launch			1
the space telescope launched in 2009 with the sole purpose of finding new stars and planets			0
its four wheels control its orientation and now two have broken			0
deputy project manager @entity145 said because of this fault : ' we ca n't point where we need to point			1
we ca n't gather data ' they said the latest loss means the spacecraft may not be able to determine how many @entity22 - size planets are in the ' @entity60 ' where it 's not too hot or too cold for water to exist in liquid form on the surface			1
and while they praised the data collected by @entity1 so far , they said several more years of observations are needed to nail down that number			0
' this is one of the saddest days in my life			0
a crippled @entity1 may be able to do other things , but it can not do the one thing it was designed to do			0
' @entity191 of the @entity192 , who is not part of the @entity1 team , said in an email			0
in 2017 , @entity3 plans to launch @entity196 - designed to search for planets around nearby stars .			2

two of the four @entity1 wheels have stopped working
@entity3 engineers are attempting to restart the wheel from @entity22 because the craft is too far away to send a rescue mission
if the wheel ca n't be restarted , the four - year mission may have to be *abandoned*
