by @entity0 published : 12:51 est , 13 january 2014 updated : 05:17 est , 14 january 2014 the keen eye of @entity4 ’s @entity3 has spotted the @entity5 meandering towards a giant @entity7 mountain			1
its tracks can be seen in two separate images taken by the spacecraft ’s @entity11 ( @entity11 ) camera on december 11 2013			2
the images show where the rover has zigzagged around obstacles on its route toward the lower slopes of @entity19 , its next major destination			0
the @entity5 and tracks left by its driving appear in this portion of a december 11 , 2013 , image			1
the rover is near the lower - left corner of this view			0
for scale , the two parallel lines of the wheel tracks are about 3 metres ( 10 feet ) apart @entity11 first imaged the @entity31 spacecraft while it was descending on a parachute to place @entity5 on @entity7 17 months ago			0
since then , it has provided updated views of the one - tonne rover 's traverse , as seen from orbit			0
in the first image , the rover is near the lower - left corner of this view			0
for scale , the two parallel lines of the wheel tracks are about 10 feet ( 3m ) apart			0
two parallel tracks left by the wheels of the @entity5 cross rugged ground			0
the image was taken by the @entity11 ( @entity11 ) camera on @entity4 's @entity3 the central panel of this graphic is a view from orbit that includes tracks of drives made by @entity4 's @entity5 in october to december of 2013			1
the six images at left and right are rover 's - eye views at the locations marked with yellow letters a through @entity60 on the central panel			0
@entity62 is from @entity5 's rear @entity63 from the rover 's @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 and @entity69 from the rover 's @entity70 @entity19 , also called @entity19 , is a layered mound in the centre of @entity7 ' @entity74 , which rises more than 5km ( 3 miles )			1
the mountain exposes many layers where scientists anticipate finding evidence about how the ancient @entity7 environment changed and evolved			2
mission scientists want the @entity5 to climb up the mountain 's lower reaches , reading a record of the red planet 's changing environmental conditions as it goes			1
a second image shows the @entity5 's tracks as seen by the orbiter spacecraft , but not the rover itself			2
@entity5 arrived inside @entity7 ' huge @entity74 in late in 2012 with a mission to determine if the red planet could ever have supported life			1
the mission has since accomplished its goal , when it uncovered an area near its landing site called @entity97 which was found to be habitable billions of years ago			0
in july 2013 , curiosity rover left @entity97 and began heading for the base of @entity19 , which is about 5km ( 3 miles )			0
@entity19 , in the middle of @entity74 , exposes many layers where scientists anticipate finding evidence about how the ancient @entity7 environment changed and evolved			2
scientists want the @entity5 to climb up the mountain 's lower reaches , reading a record of the red planet 's changing environmental on its way			1
curiosity is due to reach the @entity19 's foothills — which are around 8.6km ( 5.3 miles ) from @entity97 — around the middle of this year			1
curiosity is due to reach the @entity19 's foothills - which are around 8.6km ( 5.3 miles ) from @entity97 - around the middle of this year			1

@entity3 spotted @entity5 on december 11
it is due to reach the @entity19 's foothills around the middle of this year
once there , scientists want @entity5 to climb up the mountain , reading a record of the red planet 's changing environment on its way
