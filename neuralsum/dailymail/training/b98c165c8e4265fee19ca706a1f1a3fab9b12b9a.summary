’ ‘ there is no simple , easy answer to this because you ca n't create an engineer overnight			0
‘ you 've got to go right back in the school system , which is what we are doing , and say , “ right , are we encouraging kids to study the right subjects ? ”			0
‘ there was a time when local colleges were just looking up to government and saying , “ right , what courses shall we study in order to tick all your boxes ? ” ‘ we are saying , “ forget that , instead of looking up to the government , get out there and meet with the companies and find out what they want you to train people up into ’			2
