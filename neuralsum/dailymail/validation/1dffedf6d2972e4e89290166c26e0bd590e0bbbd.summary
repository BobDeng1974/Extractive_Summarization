two months before man set foot on the moon for the first time , @entity0 stood on the @entity6 terraces to witness a @entity8 moment			0
just 12 at the time , he could hardly have known 46 years would pass before a @entity9 scored another international hat - trick			2
' i was here when @entity12 scored four , ' said the @entity14 boss after @entity16 's star turn against @entity17			1
' it 's a long time ago — and a few stone ago — but i was there			2
' @entity16 celebrates scoring a hat - trick for @entity22 in the 6 - 1 victory over @entity17 @entity16 is the first @entity22 player to score three goals in a game since @entity12 in 1969 @entity16 ( right ) scored his third goal with a left - footed strike from range for @entity22 against @entity17 @entity16 was recently mocked on @entity29 for buying a @entity30 after inconsistent form for his club , @entity32 @entity33 converted a penalty to put @entity22 ahead against @entity17 at @entity6 on sunday @entity22 ( 3 - 4 - 3 ) : @entity35 6 ; @entity36 6 , @entity37 6 , @entity38 5 ; @entity39 4 ( @entity40 46 ) , @entity41 6 , @entity33 6 , @entity42 5 , @entity43 6 ( @entity44 74 ) ; @entity45 6 ( @entity46 66 ) , @entity16 7			1

goal : @entity62 , 19 referee : @entity82 ( @entity83 ) the @entity85 standings after @entity22 's 6 - 1 win vs @entity17 he was back again , on sunday night			1
the old ash wooden steps are long gone , but the technical area provided an excellent vantage point to watch the landmarks tumble down as heavily as the rain over @entity93			0
@entity16 climbed back into his @entity30 as the first @entity22 player to drive home a hat - trick since @entity12 in an 8 - 0 win over @entity98 in may 1969			1
@entity0 's team became the first in dark blue to rack up half a dozen goals since a 6 - 0 thrashing of the @entity104 in 2006			1
and , to prove history comes in all shapes and sizes , @entity35 became the first keeper to lose a goal to the minnows of @entity17 in a competitive international			1
' @entity48 and @entity0 now love me , ' said @entity0 , only half joking			0
' they think i 'm the best manager in the world for not picking them — they 're not in the history books			0
' rightly , @entity22 's boss was quick to hand credit to the visitors			1
@entity16 took the headlines with his first goals for his country since april 2009 , @entity33 scoring two penalties and @entity45 the other			1
yet this was a patchy , unconvincing performance at times			0
the @entity14 won the three points and are still on course in @entity85 the @entity17 team of semi-pro part - timers put together by @entity130 made the first half an astonishing affair at times			1
their tally of goals against is now 27 in five qualifiers			0
but for 10 minutes the one they scored threatened to break the worldwide web			0
' i 'm so proud of all the players , ' said @entity17 's interim coach			1
' they 've given us everything			0
and now we 're even getting free fish and chips to celebrate — the @entity148 chippie in @entity93 sent a card to the hotel this morning saying they were laying them on for us … ' presumably the fish was as battered as their defenders at the end of a long 90 minutes			0
@entity22 's breakthrough came from the penalty spot in 18 minutes via a dubious award			1
@entity39 , earning his second cap , played a pass inviting @entity33 to give chase			2
the attacker got to the byeline first , knocking the ball past keeper @entity57 and out of play			0
had the keeper kept his hands to himself @entity17 would have survived			2
instead he sent the striker tumbling rashly			0
it took a word from the assistant behind the goal to make the @entity83 ref 's mind up , @entity33 tucking home			1
that , we assumed , was that			0
with a goal at their back @entity22 would make short work of the spirited , plucky underdogs			1
so there was widespread disbelief when @entity17 refused to be patronised or quelled			2
it was glorious stuff , in truth			0
the very essence of football			0
the visitors had already caused panic in the eighth minute when @entity59 threw in a cross from the left flank which keeper @entity35 flapped at horribly , the ball careering off his own crossbar			0
@entity33 ( left ) won the first penalty and picked himself up to score and put @entity22 in the lead @entity65 ( second right ) hauled @entity17 level 72 seconds later with their first ever international goal @entity62 's goal sparked jubilant celebrations from @entity17 's players as @entity6 was stunned into solence @entity17 's team celebrate as they draw level in the @entity209 qualifier against @entity22 @entity17 had around 500 supporters inside @entity6 to witness their teams first ever competitive international goal @entity16 ( left ) scores @entity22 's second and his first of the game to return his team into the lead @entity33 scored @entity22 's third and his second of the game which also came from the penalty spot trying — and failing — to adapt to the novelty of a three - man defence featuring one central defender and two full - backs in a 3 - 2 - 4 - 1 formation , @entity22 were caught cold in the aftermath of the opener			1
' we took it for granted @entity17 were not going to score , ' admitted @entity0			2
it was a big mistake			0
@entity38 was out of position when @entity65 wrote himself into the history books , racing onto a pass by @entity66 to slot through the legs of @entity35 for 1 - 1			1
pre-match expectations of a rout suddenly felt rather foolish			0
@entity22 spent 10 minutes at home tied with a @entity238 of just 30,000 people			2
they reclaimed the lead in 29 minutes , @entity16 scoring his first since april 2009			1
a right - footed cross from the left flank by @entity244 was headed unconvincingly up into the air by defender @entity60			0
@entity16 reacted first , nodding the ball inside the right - hand post as the keeper scrambled in slow motion across his line			1
he savoured the moment , sliding on his knees in relief as much as anything			0
the monkey , at last , was off his back collectively , there would be no repeat of the calamity which followed the first goal			0
in the aftermath of the third goal , in 34 minutes , the game followed its pre-ordained script			0
it came from a second penalty of the game , rightly awarded for a bizarre flying challenge from @entity17 scorer @entity62 on @entity45			1
@entity33 opted for the tried and tested , going for the same corner , but a little higher			2
it flew into the net for 3 - 1			1
@entity17 were now a busted flush			2
@entity16 hit the outside of the post with a deft effort , but the fourth goal came seven minutes before the interval			1
the visitors played themselves into trouble in their own area , @entity43 managing to stay onside before picking out @entity45 with a cut - back			1
he netted smartly for 4 - 1			1
the scoreline , as half - time beckoned , had a more acceptable hue			2
oddly , however , @entity22 refused to apply a foot to the throats of their fading visitors			2
@entity16 , in truth , might have had five here			2
he blew a wonderful chance from an @entity36 cross in 62 minutes but improved markedly when @entity46 appeared to provide some back - up in attack			0
the only disappointment was that @entity46 did n't claim a goal or two as well			0
he had his chances , controlling a long diagonal ball from fellow sub @entity44 in 76 minutes before thrashing the ball into the side - netting			0
he atoned within a minute when his cross from the right flank picked out @entity16 for his second goal — a downward header			2
the @entity32 striker should have had his hat - trick four minutes from time when he thumped a neat @entity46 lay - off towards goal but @entity57 saved			2
yet the @entity17 keeper was merely delaying the inevitable			0
with one minute of normal time to play , @entity16 produced the kind of calm , composed finish which comes of renewed confidence , passing the ball into the bottom corner from 16 yards for a small , long - awaited slice of @entity14 footballing history			1
@entity318 striker @entity45 ( right ) extended @entity22 's advantage on 38 , sweeping home a cross unmarked @entity16 added @entity22 's fifth goal with his second of the game in the 77th minute for @entity22 @entity16 celebrates his second goal for @entity22 against @entity17 on sunday @entity22 manager @entity0 shouts instructions to his team during the match against @entity17			1

@entity22 took the lead through @entity33 before @entity65 equalised with @entity17 's first competitive goal
@entity16 , @entity33 and @entity45 guided @entity22 to a 4 - 1 lead at half time
@entity16 completed his *treble* with two goals in the second half
