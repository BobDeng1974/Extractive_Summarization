@entity0 has backed down in a row over free speech by re-instating links to news stories it had previously stripped from the internet			1
the company was accused of over-zealously tearing down links to webpages following demands from people claiming their so - called ' right to be forgotten '			1
but links to articles which had previously been deleted have now re-appeared on the website after public outcry at what many viewed as unacceptable censorship of the internet			1
@entity0 has reinstated links to news articles after accusations a new ruling on the ' right to be forgotten ' was leading to unacceptable censorship of the internet earlier this week , @entity25 reported how links to a number of completely accurate news stories had disappeared from @entity0 's search results following requests using a controversial @entity32 ruling			1
the changes meant anyone searching for information through the search engine would have been completely unaware the news stories existed			0
following the widespread criticism of the new system , many links were today re-indexed on @entity0			1
a @entity25 article about a @entity42 referee found to have lied about his reasons for giving a penalty during a top flight football match was among those re-instated			1
the webpage had been among the first removed from @entity0 after the new rules came into force			1
@entity25 understands that links to articles on other news websites have now also been reinstated			1
@entity0 has declined to comment on the re-appearing links , but this morning insisted the process of deleting search results was still ' work in progress '			1
links to a @entity25 article about @entity42 referee @entity58 , who lied about a penalty incident , have been re-instated on @entity0 following outcry at so - called ' right to be forgotten ' rules head of communications @entity63 told the @entity65 : ' we have to balance a whole range of things - free expression , privacy and the public 's right to know			1
' this is new territory for us all			0
there 's no right of appeal in the @entity32 but we think it 's important to have a public debate about this			0
this is a very , very important issue for the future of privacy , free expression and journalism			0
' it emerged earlier today that @entity0 now has a backlog of more than 250,000 censorship requests to deal with and is deleting links purely because people did not want their comments on news stories to be viewed online			1
mr @entity63 said : ' the @entity32 ruling was not something that we welcomed or wanted , but it is now the law in @entity98 and we are obliged to comply with that law			1
@entity0 's @entity63 today said the new law is not something the company ' wanted or welcomed ' ' we are aiming to deal with it as responsibly as possible			2
we 've had more than 70,000 requests so far			0
that 's a huge task			0
in most cases we 've had about four webpages per request , so that 's something like 250,000 requests to remove content			1
' @entity65 economics editor @entity112 this week highlighted a letter he had received from @entity0 about a 2007 blog post he wrote about investment bank @entity115 and its former boss @entity116 , which would no longer be shown in some search results			2
it emerged today that the page was not hidden in response to a complaint from the bank or mr @entity116 , but a request from a member of the public who posted a response to the blog and no longer wanted it to be available to people searching his name			2
mr @entity63 acknowledged that mr @entity112 's article was ' very much in the public interest ' , but said : ' it relates to an ordinary member of the public who left a comment on @entity112 's blog - maybe something embarrassing - and he contacted @entity0 and asked to have that page revealed			2
' if you search for @entity115 it will appear			0
if you search for @entity116 it will appear			0
only if you search for the very narrow term of the name of the individual commenter would it not appear			0
' mr @entity63 added : ' we have to balance the need for transparency with the need to protect people 's identity as well			0
in all cases where we remove content , we let the webmaster of the site know that we 've removed content			0
' mr @entity112 said it was ' a bit weird ' that his article could be blocked because an individual regretted a comment he had voluntarily posted years ago			0
he said : ' people voluntarily put things up			0
nobody coerces them to leave comments on my blog			0
i just think it 's slightly odd that there should now be a law in place that basically says if you feel a bit embarrassed about what you said , you can hide yourself			0
' i 'm not saying it 's @entity0 's problem , but it does seem to me to be something a bit weird about a world in which you can allow people to cause enormous bureaucratic difficulties for all the search engine companies and lots of uncertainty about what can be found and ca n't be found , just because they feel a bit embarrassed about what they said a few years earlier			1
' this does seem a sort of feather - bedding of people that some might think is a bit over the top			0
' a warning telling website users that links may have been taken down now appears in some search results internet users have found that they are able to keep hold of links to their archive by using the @entity208 domain @entity209 , rather than the			2
co.uk domain bound by the @entity98 rules			2
the purge of search results applies to @entity0 's local search pages covering the @entity216 's 28 member nations and four other @entity98 countries , encompassing more than 500 million people			1
but users in @entity98 who switch to the firm 's @entity208 domain , @entity209 , will find unaltered search results			2
@entity0 is only deleting information that appears on its own results pages			2
it has no control over information on external websites , which did not fall under the court 's ruling			2
the internet giant said it is currently receiving about 1,000 requests for the removal of information per day			1
@entity234 mp @entity233 said : ‘ this draconian ruling risks turning internet search engines from being the great 21st century emancipators of millions of ordinary people into arbitrary censors			1
’ which article has @entity0 reinstated ? @entity42 referee @entity58 quits with a stinging blast at the @entity242 and his critics in november 2010 , we reported how under - fire referee @entity58 delivered a withering blast at @entity42 football as he finally bowed to mounting pressure and quit the game			1
@entity58 , who was found to have lied about his reasons for granting a penalty in a @entity253 v @entity255 match , took a pot shot at former @entity258 winger @entity257 and @entity255 manager @entity259			0
@entity58 could not resist one final verbal volley at the @entity242 , claiming their lack of support led to a weekend strike by @entity42 match officials , while pointing the finger at @entity257 and @entity266 for allegedly questioning his integrity .			0

controversial @entity98 court ruling gave people ' right to be forgotten '
@entity0 has since been sent 250,000 demands to remove links to webpages
links to @entity25 articles were among the 1,000 taken down every day
the move caused outrage , with @entity0 accused of censoring the internet
@entity25 publisher @entity284 was among the most vocal critics of move
@entity0 has now backed down , re-instating links to a number of articles
