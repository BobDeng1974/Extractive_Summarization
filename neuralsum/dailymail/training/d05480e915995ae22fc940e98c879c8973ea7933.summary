they will be required to pay the ‘ entry fee ’ as part of a guarantee that they will not be a burden on taxpayers and will leave when their visa expires			1
the cash would be repaid when migrants leave , but only if they demonstrate that they have not drawn on services , such as non-urgent @entity21 care or other elements of the welfare state			1
the home secretary , who has already cut the number of migrants coming to @entity3 to its lowest level for almost a decade , wants ‘ immigration bonds ’ to be the next stage of reforms			1
sources say she hopes to announce a pilot scheme , targeted at ‘ high - risk ’ individuals from ‘ two or three ’ countries , starting later this year			2
migrants , or family members already in the @entity3 , would be required to put up a sum running into thousands of pounds			1
the 1999 @entity38 gave the government the right to demand such a financial security from temporary migrants , which can be forfeited if they fail to leave after the expiry of their visa			0
however , mrs may ’s bonds would only apply to @entity49 migrants , otherwise they would fall foul of @entity52 rights to free movement			0
the proposals emerged amid @entity56 attempts to shift its position on immigration , with the party admitting that it should have been more ‘ ready to talk about problems ’ in the system , adding : ‘ that needs to change			2
’ last week , official figures showed that the government ’s squeeze on entrants from outside the @entity67 has succeeded in pushing immigration into @entity3 to its lowest level in nearly a decade			1
the number coming to live in @entity3 fell by 74,000 in the 12 months to june last year as curbs on students and workers from outside @entity52 began to bite			0
‘ we have reviewed all migration routes to the @entity3 and have put in place measures to reduce immigration , ’ said a source close to the home secretary			1
‘ the latest statistics are encouraging and show that net migration continues to fall			0
but our work is not complete			0
’ the source said mrs may was examining ‘ financial bonds as a further deterrent to reduce non-compliance by high - risk nationalities ’			0
the measures are being considered as part of a package designed to limit the number of people who come from @entity92 and @entity93 when controls are lifted at the end of this year ‘ we are looking at a pilot at the end of the year , ’ they added			0
‘ if you ’re allowed to come to the @entity3 on , say , a family visit visa , you would have to put down a bond to guarantee that you wo n’t draw on certain services and to prove that you will leave the country			1
‘ when you leave , as per the terms of your visa , you can have your money back			0
if you do n’t , we will put the money into an enforcement pot. ’ ministers are also examining separate proposals to reduce ‘ pull factors ’ for migrants from the @entity67			2
a triple squeeze on access to the @entity21 , taxpayer - subsidised housing and welfare is being considered as part of a package designed to limit the number of people who come from @entity92 and @entity93 when controls are lifted at the end of this year			0
the latest proposals will cheer the @entity123 benches , following confirmation that mrs may is examining options for reform of human rights law , including withdrawal from the @entity129 , to be included in the party ’s next manifesto			0
@entity56 examined the idea of making families pay a £ 1,000 deposit for visiting relatives to ensure they left the @entity3 on time , but eventually backed away from the idea			2
