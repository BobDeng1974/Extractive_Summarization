bare facts : naked rambler @entity1 has lost his appeal at the @entity4 at last , the @entity1 has reached the end of the road			1
after almost a decade in and out of prison , @entity8 ’s most surprising inmate — real name @entity1 — has lost his chance of freedom at the @entity4 in @entity13			1
he must now keep serving his two - and - a - half - year sentence in @entity15 for breaching an indefinite asbo against being naked in public			1
the former @entity18 from @entity19 , @entity20 , had claimed the right to remain naked under @entity22 and ten of the @entity24 : the right to freedom of expression and the right to a private life			1
the court — normally so indulgent of all sorts of crackpot human rights dreamt up by greedy lawyers — accepted that the 54 - year - old had a right to freedom of expression ; and that the ‘ acceptance of public nudity in a modern society is a matter of public interest ’			1
the judges did not accept that this gave him the right to strip off in public			0
nor did they agree his cycle of imprisonment , freedom and imprisonment violated his rights			1
is he cowed ? not a bit of it			0
when @entity58 next steps outside @entity15 , you can bet he ’ll still be in his birthday suit			0
he even insists on going naked in jail , which is why he has spent much of his prison time in solitary confinement			2
‘ i expected them to take the wider view , ’ he said on hearing the verdict			0
then again , what great endeavour ever succeeded without having to surmount many obstacles that stood in its way ? why should it be any different for me ? i have no choice but to continue			0
’ @entity1 , the son of a carpenter , left the @entity76 at 21 to explore @entity77 and take up @entity78 , and then join the @entity79			1
‘ i was looking for the answer , ’ he said — but eventually came back to live in @entity20 , working as a lorry driver			0
now , his life is dedicated to the open road — with no clothes on			2
he first started walking naked in @entity85 , where he ’d moved for a spell with his partner and two children			2
as he has put it , one day he had an ‘ epiphany ’ : that he was ‘ good ’ on a fundamental level — as was his naked body , too			2
he embarked on his public naked campaign in @entity8 in 2003 , on a nude walk from @entity95 to @entity96 during which he was arrested 15 times and imprisoned for 140 nights			2
that did n’t stop him doing the same walk — and being arrested and imprisoned all over again — in 2005			0
on the most recent occasion he was released , in april this year , he strolled out of @entity15 wearing only his shoes and was promptly rearrested for breaching a pre-existing @entity103 , which had been imposed in 2013			1
he was convicted over that matter last month , leading to his current two - and - a - half - year sentence			1
mr @entity1 is pretty hardline about nudism			1
he feels it ’s something of a mission — and certainly not an activity to be confined behind closed doors			0
‘ i stand for freedom , ’ he has claimed			2
‘ some people heat up their house especially so they can go naked and i think that ’s nuts			2
’ others fear that description might better apply to him			0
even his own mother , @entity118 , has never understood his motivation			0
‘ i know it ’s something to do with freedom but he ’s not free , is he ? stuck in jail , ’ she commented earlier this year			1
certainly , @entity1 has forfeited a normal life : wife , family , career			1
before prison , he had no obvious source of income , describing his naked antics as his version of ‘ getting a proper job ’ , and reportedly sleeping rough on his rambles			2
his two children are teenagers , and he is no longer with their mother			0
during a 2012 court appearance he broke down in tears , saying : ‘ there ’s nothing about me as a human being that is indecent or alarming or offensive			1
that ’s where i ’m coming from , which is deep inside			0
’ it takes around £ 65,000 to imprison a person in @entity8 , after police and court costs are taken into account ; the actual prison term then costs around £ 40,000 a year			1
over the past 11 years , @entity1 has been arrested more than 50 times			1
practically every time he walks out of prison , he is arrested again for being naked			2
and whenever he appears in court , it is normally an extended hearing because of his refusal to wear clothes — which can lead to extra contempt of court charges			1
stubborn : practically every time @entity1 walks out of prison , he is arrested again for being naked			1
and whenever he appears in court , it is normally an extended hearing because of his refusal to wear clothes at a conservative estimate , more than half a million pounds has been spent on convicting and jailing him			1
the waste of police and court time has been immense , too , at a time when the judicial , policing and prison system is severely overstretched			0
he is currently among 85,720 people behind bars in @entity8			0
meanwhile , his lawyers say there ’s been ‘ no discussion , certainly no ruling , on @entity1 ’s mental health ’			1
in @entity8 , there is no single , simple law against public nudity			0
that means you ’re not immediately breaking the law if you go skinny - dipping on your summer holidays			0
@entity185 , too , is allowed by the law , which exempts those ‘ whose intention is limited to going about his or her lawful business naked ’ from prosecution under the 2003 @entity192			0
that act rightly outlaws flashing — the exposure of your genitals with the intention of causing harm or distress			0
naturists are also exempted from the laws on outraging public decency , under which you can be prosecuted for public acts of a lewd , obscene or disgusting nature			0
but @entity1 does n’t think of himself as a naturist , nor do naturists think he is one of them			1
where @entity1 runs into trouble is under the @entity210 , which criminalises ‘ disorderly behaviour within the hearing or sight of a person likely to be caused harassment , alarm or distress ’			1
with this act , @entity1 ’s own intentions are neither here nor there			1
what matters is the effect on other people ’s minds			0
dedicated : before prison , @entity1 had no obvious source of income , describing his naked antics as his version of ‘ getting a proper job ’ , and reportedly sleeping rough on his rambles understandably , parents of small children are particularly alarmed when @entity1 comes striding along , naked except for his boots , socks and , on sunny days , a hat			1
on these occasions , he is often his own worst enemy			0
‘ how can nature expressed in human form be indecent ? ’ he said on hearing that his appeal had failed in @entity242			0
‘ yet it is these absurd beliefs that form the underlying assumptions of the countless criminal charges and convictions against me , resulting in over nine years in solitary confinement in @entity8 prisons			0
’ the @entity4 case goes back to an incident in 2011 , when he was asked by two policemen in @entity255 to put his clothes on			0
he had just walked out of @entity255 — naked , of course			1
when the case got to court , he again appeared naked and refused to heed the sheriff ’s warnings that he would be held in contempt if he did n’t get dressed			2
the sheriff duly sentenced him to 330 days for breach of the peace and 90 days for the contempt charge , along with 237 days unspent from a previous sentence — a total of one year , nine months and 18 days			2
and , as the law stands , complicated as it is , the conclusion is clear — @entity1 will go on being arrested until he puts his pants back on			2
@entity1 ’s lawyer , @entity271 of firm @entity272 , acknowledges this is the case			2
‘ as the law stands , even if there ’s no one around to be offended , he could go to prison for several years			0
in our view , that ’s disproportionate			0
’ his client , he expects , will probably be released from his current sentence in a year and a half — and is ‘ pretty set ’ on continuing his campaign			2
indeed , @entity1 ’s lawyers are now launching an appeal against his conviction for breaching his asbo , on the basis that he was not allowed to appear naked in court to defend himself			1
perhaps @entity1 ’s mad , inconvenient but single - minded crusade will eventually force the police and courts to reconsider those endless prosecutions			1
after all , who breaks a naked butterfly on a wheel ?			0

@entity1 just lost his last chance at freedom at human rights court
he is serving *2.5* - year sentence for breaching @entity103 against being naked
the *persistent* naturist has walked the country without clothes on
