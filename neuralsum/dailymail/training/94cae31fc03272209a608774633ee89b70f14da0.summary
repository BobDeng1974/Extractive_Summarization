by @entity0 published : 12:02 est , 15 march 2013 updated : 20:16 est , 15 march 2013 for 20 years he denied any part in the racist killing of @entity4			1
but finally – after a private prosecution , landmark public inquiry , years of police investigations and a murder conviction – @entity4 has admitted his guilt			1
the 37 - year - old yesterday abandoned his appeal against that conviction – a development that raises hopes of him turning ‘ supergrass ’			1
why 's that then ? @entity4 ( left ) has dropped his appeal against his murder conviction for killing @entity4 ( right ) detectives are expected to consider visiting him in prison to urge him to turn in the rest of the gang that killed @entity0 in 1993			1
@entity4 , the second murderer jailed last year , is continuing with plans to appeal against his conviction but police are confident the 36 - year - old gangster ’s son will fail			1
@entity4 ’s decision was welcomed by @entity0 ’s mother @entity29			1
in a moving statement , she spoke of the ‘ pain and heartbreak ’ of the years she has spent waiting for his confession			0
mrs @entity36 said : ‘ it took me and my family almost 20 years to get justice for my son @entity0 when @entity4 and @entity4 were convicted of the murder in january 2012			1
‘ in those years i had put my grieving on hold and had to struggle against police racism			0
it would have been a great comfort to me and my family if @entity4 or his accomplices had admitted what they had done			1
‘ now that @entity4 has dropped his appeal i can only assume it is because he has finally admitted he murdered @entity0			1
‘ he could have done this much earlier and avoided the pain and heartache me and my family have had to suffer over so many years			0
‘ i now hope that @entity4 will do the same and avoid prolonging my pain			1
i also hope that those others who were involved on the 22nd april 1993 follow @entity4 ’s lead and admit their own involvement			1
’ @entity4 ’s decision is a huge boost to mrs @entity36 and her family as they prepare for a memorial service that will mark exactly two decades since @entity0 ’s murder			1
and it is likely to re-energise the @entity64 ’s marathon quest to lock up the entire gang of five suspected of stabbing the 18 - year - old to death in @entity68 , @entity69			0
yesterday , a senior @entity71 detective said the inquiry remains ‘ live and active ’			0
the @entity73 has campaigned for 16 years for justice for @entity0			0
in february 1997 , we published pictures of the five suspects – including @entity4 and @entity4 – under the headline ‘ murderers ’ and challenged them to sue us if we were wrong			2
no legal action was ever taken			0
we repeated the same front page in july 2006 , and yet again none of the race - hate yobs issued proceedings			0
our acclaimed campaign exposed police failings and led to the setting up of a public inquiry that branded the @entity64 ‘ institutionally racist ’			0
behind bars : @entity4 is continuing to fight against his conviction for the1993 murder of @entity4 it also sparked legal changes that allowed @entity4 , previously acquitted of @entity0 ’s murder , to stand trial again			1
after both were found guilty in january last year , @entity4 was ordered to serve a minimum of 15 years and two months , while @entity4 was given a minimum of 14 years and three months			1
father - of - two @entity4 and @entity4 , who has five children from various relationships , were finally trapped following an expert review of forensic evidence from the original investigation			2
fibres and hairs linked them to their victim			0
@entity4 ’s appeal focused on challenging the integrity of the forensic evidence			2
ever since his conviction , his legal team has tried in vain to undermine its credibility			0
sources say @entity4 is appealing on the basis that the use in evidence of a surveillance video showing him to be racist was unfair			2
last summer , applications for permission to appeal by both men were rejected by a single judge who considered the papers from the case			0
but @entity4 and @entity4 still had the right to renew their applications before judges sitting at the @entity128			2
a spokesman for the @entity130 confirmed yesterday that @entity4 had shelved his appeal			2
he could receive a significant reduction in his prison sentence if he testifies against fellow , unconvicted members of the murder gang			0
police believe they have exhausted all opportunities to gather new forensic evidence in the @entity4 case , meaning their best chance of nailing the other gang members is if a new witness comes forward – or @entity4 tells the truth			2
because he pleaded not guilty at his trial , @entity4 would have to come up with compelling new evidence to have any chance of a sentence reduction			2
in 1994 , @entity0 ’s family brought a failed private prosecution against @entity4 and @entity4 and brothers @entity150 and @entity152 and @entity153			0
@entity4 and @entity4 are believed to have spent up to £ 1million of public money on defence costs before and during their murder trial			1
but the @entity158 has blocked a request for information as to how much			0
sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
