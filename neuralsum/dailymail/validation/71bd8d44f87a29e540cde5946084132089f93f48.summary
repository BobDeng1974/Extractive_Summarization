two neighbouring ancient craters thought to be have been formed by the same impact event are now thought to have been created by two separate asteroids			1
the extremely unlikely formation theory was reached after scientists re-analysed rocks at the site , and found dates for the two were vastly different			2
while both had been thought to be 285 million years old , it now appears one of the craters is actually 450 million years old but , by chance , was created in almost exactly the same spot			1
its thought the @entity22 crater asteroid impacted a marine environment during the @entity25 period , 490 million years ago			1
the @entity27 crater was created in the @entity28 period 285 million years ago and impacted the landmass @entity30 researchers from the @entity32 say the @entity17 in @entity18 were formed by two separate events in a ' pure coincidence '			1
the remarkable finding , if confirmed , has important implications for other so - called ' doublet ' craters in the solar system , previously thought to be formed by binary or multiple rocks impacting at the same time			1
and the huge difference in time between the two events is even more amazing as , at the time the first crater was made , the location of the second was underwater			0
the research was published in the journal @entity48 and reported by @entity49			0
impacts that leave behind a 62 - mile ( 100km ) diameter crater or less , such as those that struck the @entity17 , are widely thought to have no global effects			2
in fact , impacts can even increase biodiversity			0
for example , the @entity57 , which saw an explosion in the number of animal species around 470 million years ago , has been linked to frequent impact events at the time			1
this is possibly due to the fact that an impact could disrupt local life just enough to let another species dominate , or because slowly cooling craters can provide habitats for life			0
even if the @entity17 impacts were caused by a double impact , the extra energy released by two bodies smashing into the @entity73 simultaneously would have had no significant effect on life			2
while the fireball and earthquake would have decimated any life within a few hundred kilometers , the impacts were not big enough to cause much chaos on a global scale			0
the @entity17 in @entity18 are a pair of lakes labelled as @entity27 and @entity22			1
the smaller eastern crater is about 16 miles ( 26km ) in diameter , while the western crater is about 22 miles ( 36km )			0
in the original theory , a binary asteroid - two asteroids orbiting a common centre of mass - struck the ground simultaneously 285 million years ago			1
but the researchers say the original methods used to date the @entity22 lake , by measuring amounts of argon - 40 , were inaccurate			1
upon analysing new samples at the site , they found a maximum age of 460 million years , far older than the @entity100 , which is 285 million years old			1
' the close spatial arrangement of the two @entity17 is most likely pure coincidence , ' the researchers wrote in their paper			2
a similar figure was reached by researchers in 1990 by a separate research team , but at the time the findings were dismissed as incorrect due to a supposed contamination from excess argon			0
but with four different rock samples from various parts of the lake now studied , the researchers say it is highly unlikely they would all yield the same false age			0
' we think that the accurate age for the @entity118 crater was , in fact , already measured back in 1990 , ' said geologist and lead author dr @entity121 of the university			0
the smaller eastern crater is about 16 miles ( 26km ) in diameter , while the western crater is about 22 miles ( 36km )			0
in the original theory , a binary asteroid - two asteroids orbiting a common centre of mass - struck the ground simultaneously 285 million years ago , but that is now believed to be inaccurate the remarkable finding , if confirmed , has important implications for other so - called ' doublet ' craters in the solar system , previously thought to be formed by binary or multiple rocks impacting at the same time			1
shown is a map of the location of the @entity17 it 's unlikely that the event that formed the @entity17 had any significant impact on life			2
even if the @entity17 impacts were caused by a double impact , the extra energy released by two bodies smashing into the @entity73 simultaneously would have had no significant effect on life further evidence for the latest findings comes from the amount of chlorine in the two craters			2
this part of @entity18 - referred to as @entity157 - had less land 460 million years ago than it did 285 million years ago , when waters receded , forming the landmass called @entity30			1
the rocks from the @entity22 crater have more chlorine than the @entity27 crater , suggesting they formed on a coastline when water was still abundant in the area			2
despite the fact that it is statistically very unlikely for the two craters to have been formed in two separate impact events , the new evidence unearthed by the team shows that in this case the more unlikely scenario is true			0
' overall , the doublet theory has been so compellingly advocated over the decades that alternative scenarios seem to have been abandoned , ' said dr @entity121			0
' in our view , there is a whole line of geologic evidence that argues against the double impact			0

two craters in @entity18 may not have been formed by a binary asteroid
the @entity17 were thought to have both formed 285m years ago
but analysis of rocks suggests the @entity22 lake is much older
it is thought to have been created separately 460 million years ago
this means the craters were formed by an extremely unlikely coincidence of two asteroids landing in the same spot , *185* million years apart
