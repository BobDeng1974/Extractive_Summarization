by @entity0 a historic folly which was bought for just £ 1 when it fell into a woeful state has now gone on the market for £ 750,000 - after the owners spent 13 years restoring it to its former glory			1
@entity8 and @entity9 bought the ' jewel of a property ' near @entity12 , @entity13 in 2001 , complete with shattered ceilings , a crumbled tower and overgrown trees jutting through the broken windows			1
the pair bought the building for £ 350,000 from a local philanthropist , who acquired the dilapidated property for just £ 1 and tried to bring it up to scratch			1
@entity23 , which sits proudly on top of a 60ft hill overlooking 1.7acres on land near @entity12 , @entity13 , has been put on the market for £ 750,000 after being bought for £ 1 just 30 years ago the @entity30 castle was sold to a bookshop owner in 1984 after falling into such a state of disrepair that the ceilings had crumbled and trees were growing through the broken windows			1
but it was snapped up by the current owners in 2001 , who set to work renovating the property the stunning three - turreted castle , formerly known as both @entity41 and @entity42 , was bought by @entity8 and @entity9 who have spent more than one decade restoring the historic building to its former glory but after spending more than decade working on the run - down wreck , @entity23 has again blossomed into the enchanting @entity30 castle it once was - and is now being sold for double the amount for which it was last bought			1
mr @entity8 , 53 , said : ' it ’s been hard work but a lot of fun and i think we have triumphed			2
we will very sad to sell this jewel of a property			0
' the stunning three - turreted hexagonal castle - formerly known as both @entity41 and @entity58 - was originally built by aristocrat sir @entity59 in 1780 , on the grounds of his sprawling country mansion , @entity62			2
the lavish building was home to an ornate music chamber , which sir @entity59 and his family used for exuberant summer parties and concerts , and later became a gamekeeper 's cottage			0
but by the 1950s , the property had fallen into disrepair and was left empty			2
in 1984 , after decades of neglect , the dilapidated castle was in such a poor state that it was sold to local bookshop owner and philanthropist @entity78 for just £ 1			1
he renovated the property to a livable standard - but there was still a lot of work to be done to bring it out of its woeful state			2
the @entity88 listed property has been renovated in an 18th century style to fit with the castle 's heritage			2
the property includes an opulent drawing room , formerly known as the music room			0
the renovation involved repairing the fireplace , having the plasterwork restored and redoing the walls , which was intricately carried out by mr @entity8 the former music room is the centre of the property and features heavily in the castle 's history			1
when the property was bought , it still featured intricate plasterwork depicting musical instruments all over the ceiling a photo of the music room , believed to be taken in the early 1950s , which shows the dilapidated music room , which has since been turned into a scene of opulence but the fate of the @entity88 - listed folly was changed in 2001 when it was snapped up by mr @entity9 , who writes and directs the @entity116 , and mr @entity8 , an art gallery owner			1
the pair , who are now moving to @entity118 , spent an undisclosed amount of money returning the property to its previous condition			1
as well as redecorating every room inside the three - bedroom property , the pair also had to repaint the outside of the castle and landscape the castle 's grounds			1
mr @entity8 , 53 , said : ' when @entity78 rescued the folly in 1984 it was in an awful state - the ceilings had fallen down , one of the towers had crumbled and all the windows were broken and there were trees growing through them			1
the folly 's hexagonal kitchen and dining room , which is described as ' small but perfectly form ' , has been decorated in an ! 8th century - style and features wooden beams this spiral staircase was also put into the renovated home after the new owners got to work restoring it			0
the staircase leads to the drawing room and another bedroom one of the bedrooms in the folly - a name coined in the 16th century , but now more associated with the 18th century due to their eccentricity and rustic charm - continues the historic theme ' the garden was completely overgrown with nettles			0
mr @entity78 made it habitable but did n’t live there for very long			0
' we bought the folly in 2001 and set about restoring in an 18th century style			1
i meticulously picked out the detail in the plaster and made the garden my project			0
' for the men , the restoration of the music room was one of the hardest tasks			0
the fireplace - which was pumping out smoke when the pair bought the castle - had to be replaced and all the plasterwork was restored			1
the re-work of the walls , which included painting the intricate adornments white , took nearly six months of long weekends , while the ceiling was painted in an extravagant style to fit the folly 's reputation			0
now the renovated property gleams from above a 60ft hill in the crater of an extinct volcano , among 1.7acres of wooden gardens			2
the home looks out to a garden which was previously full of ' overgrown nettles ' but was landscaped by the new owners when it was bought in 2001 the 1.7acre plot includes a garden pavilion , as well as wooded gardens and a 60ft hill in the crater of an extinct volcano it revolves around a stunning hexagonal kitchen and dining room , which sits on the ground floor with two bedrooms and a regal - looking hallway			1
up the spiral staircase is the drawing room and a third bedroom			0
the earliest use of the word ' folly ' to refer to a whimsical piece of architecture was in the 16th century			0
but with their quirky combination of eccentricity , romanticism and rustic charm , follies are more commonly associated with the 18th century			0
the dilapidated castle had to be completely repainted , inside and outside , when it was bought by the latest owners			2
they said it had been made habitable by the previous owner but that there was still a lot of work to be done artist @entity8 , one of the current owners , spent six months of weekends intricately painting the ceiling in the music room , adding to the ' unique ' charm of the folly @entity243 , from estate agents @entity238 and @entity239 , which is marketing the property , said : ' @entity244 is utterly enchanting and unique - there ’s nothing else quite like it			1
' it has been through several lives over the years , going from a beautiful @entity30 castle to a gamekeeper ’s cottage			1
' in 2001 the current vendor bought it and it has since been totally restored to its former glory			2
there is something wonderfully @entity258 about follies and @entity23 is one of the best			0
' it might be small but it is perfectly formed , and the views are absolutely magical			0
it is a very special place			0
' @entity62 is now a private boarding school called @entity265 .			0
