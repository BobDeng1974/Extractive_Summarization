by @entity0 and @entity1 , @entity2 former top women 's football chief @entity4 sent one of the e-mails which led to a sexism scandal engulfing @entity10 boss @entity9 , it has been claimed			1
mr @entity4 , a former president of @entity11 who has spoken out firmly for women 's rights , is accused by the @entity13 of sending a joke about ' skinny big - t * * * * * broads ' to mr @entity9			1
@entity10 chief executive mr @entity9 has apologised and is facing calls to quit after he forwarded the sexist email and several others to a lawyer friend			1
claims : a newspaper report accused @entity4 , pictured , of sending a sexist e-mail to @entity9 the scandal erupted this week after a former temporary pa to mr @entity9 leaked several e-mails to the @entity26			1
sports minister @entity27 branded the content of the e-mails ' completely unacceptable ' while her @entity31 counterpart , @entity30 , voiced fears the @entity10 could take action against the woman who leaked the e-mails			2
' there is a role for whistleblowers in public life and what has been published shows she was right to make these emails public , as this is a matter of public concern , ' he said			0
' if the league take legal action against her that would be outrageous			0
' @entity51 chairman @entity50 and league sponsor @entity52 have voiced concerns while @entity54 , the firm which employs mr @entity9 's lawyer friend , has launched an investigation			1
hot water : @entity10 chairman @entity9 has been in trouble for some inappropriate emails @entity60 has contacted mr @entity4 asking him to respond to the @entity13 's claims			1
the 70 - year - old , who lives in north @entity63 , has not yet responded publicly			1
a former vice-chairman of both @entity65 and the @entity51 , mr @entity4 helped create the @entity10 in 1992 and opened the first ladies ' youth academy to be funded by a men 's @entity10 club in 2000			1
at the time , he said : ' it is not a publicity stunt			0
ladies football is a serious sport within its own right			0
' there were 90,000 at the @entity77 final and there will be more and more on tv			0
' since then , mr @entity4 has repeatedly spoken out against sexism in football			1
he was the president of @entity11 and at one point , he said : ' it 's hypocrisy for football to call itself a family game and then keep women out of the boardroom			2
' disapproving : @entity51 chairman @entity50 has said that @entity9 's emails are totally inappropriate in a statement earlier this week , mr @entity9 said the messages were ' private emails exchanged between colleagues and friends of many years ' that should not have been accessed by the temporary employee			1
he accepted they were inappropriate and added : ' it was an error of judgment that i will not make again '			0
anger : sports minister @entity27 condemned the content of the e-mails as unacceptable an email from @entity9 sent to club chiefs just before the @entity26 's publication became public this week			2
in it he states the story has ' been obviously timed for our last day for it to cause maximum embarrassment to me and therefore the @entity10			2
' the newspaper is asserting that some of the content is sexist and inappropriate			0
you will be the judge			0
' that prompted football equality campaigner @entity117 , who chairs the @entity119 , to question @entity9 's position yesterday			2
he wrote on his blog : ' this seeming refusal to accept that the content of his emails were in fact sexist and inappropriate to my mind completely undermines his public apology , and leads to only one conclusion : that it was insincere and therefore unsustainable in the court of public opinion			0
' if it is that @entity9 did n't believe that what he had written was wrong less than a week ago , i think that it is highly unlikely that he has come to that conclusion in any reality since			0
on that basis it appears to me that his position is now looking untenable			0
' if @entity9 does n't accept the heinous nature of his sexist remarks and the impact they have had , not only on women in the game , but on the perception they create of football 's commitment to equality and inclusion in general , then regrettably i must reach the conclusion that he may be in the wrong job			2
