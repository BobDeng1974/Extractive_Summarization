watchdogs have launched an inquiry into the rip - off cost of watching live @entity4 football on television , which can be more than £ 600 a year			1
the move could cut monthly subscriptions and lead to a dramatic increase in the number of games that are shown live on tv			1
however , this would involve reducing the number of matches that kick - off at 3pm on a saturday afternoon in order to fit the live games into the tv schedules			1
watchdogs have launched an inquiry into the rip - off cost of watching live @entity4 football on television			2
pictured : march is shown between @entity21 and @entity22 any shake - up would mean that more games are played on friday and monday evenings , while there would be staggered kick - off times during saturday and sunday			1
the tv regulator @entity27 is to consult with fans , including the @entity29 , to see what they would think about sacrificing 3pm kick - offs to allow more live games on tv			1
the inquiry follows a complaint from pay tv and broadband company @entity36 , which claims the way the @entity4 sells the rights to top flight matches means armchair fans in the @entity41 are hit with unfair fees			1
the net result is that clubs like @entity45 , @entity22 and @entity46 are sharing in billions of pounds from fans whose passion and loyalty is being abused			0
currently only 41per cent of @entity4 games – 154 out of 380 – are broadcast live in a season			2
it is claimed this system of rationing leads to higher prices for armchair fans			0
by contrast all games played in the top leagues on @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity64 are broadcast live			1
the move could cut monthly subscriptions and lead to a dramatic increase in the number of games that are shown live on tv			1
pictured : @entity70 is aired on @entity71 @entity36 calculates that the minimum monthly cost of watching live @entity4 games on the sports channels of @entity71 and @entity75 comes in at £ 51			1
that works out at £ 612 a year , which is more than four times higher than the @entity79 licence fee of £ 145.50 , which covers all of its many tv and radio channels , including @entity82			0
the £ 51 figure is much higher than the £ 21 month charge football fans in @entity62 must pay to see top flight teams such as the @entity86 and @entity87 in the @entity88			0
it is also more than double the £ 25 charged in @entity64 to watch @entity90 , and compares to £ 18 in @entity61 to follow @entity91 and @entity92 and just £ 10 a month in @entity63			0
research commissioned by @entity36 found more than 15per cent of viewers say they could not watch the games they wanted through their tv provider , while 25per cent found that games were not included in their pay tv subscription			1
@entity101 ( centre ) and @entity103 ( right ) work on @entity107 ' popular @entity106 show , during which more matches could be aired if changes are made @entity36 argues that the way the @entity4 packages and sells the tv rights to football in this country works to artificially inflate the price			1
as a result , the cost of @entity4 domestic live tv rights increased by 70per cent to a staggering £ 3 billion over three years in the last auction			0
it is predicted to rise by a further 60per cent when they are sold next time			0
it also means there is absolutely no chance of live @entity4 games ever returning to free - to - air terrestrial tv channels like the @entity79 and @entity126 ever again			2
while the sports channel subscriptions are extortionate enough in themselves , @entity75 and @entity71 have also been accused of putting up many other charges for all its customers in order to cover the millions of pounds they have paid to the @entity4			0
@entity36 claims the current regime causes ‘ significant consumer harm ’ resulting from escalating rights costs			2
the inquiry comes after @entity36 , of which sir @entity138 is a shareholder , complained about the way tv rights are sold chief executive , @entity142 , welcomed the @entity27 inquiry , saying : ‘ the @entity4 is a global success story and one of the @entity41 ’s greatest exports and everyone wants that to remain the case			1
‘ the fact remains that fans in the @entity41 pay the highest prices in @entity152 to watch the least amount of football on tv			0
now is the right time to look again at the way live rights are sold to make football even more accessible			0
‘ we look forward to working constructively with the @entity4 , the wider industry and @entity27 to ensure a better deal for football fans			2
’ @entity27 said : ‘ @entity36 argues that the proportion of matches made available for live television broadcast under the current @entity4 rights deals – at 41per cent – is lower than some other leading @entity152 leagues , where more matches are available for live television broadcast			1
‘ the complaint alleges that this contributes to higher prices for consumers of pay tv packages that include premium sport channels and for the pay tv retailers of premium sports channels			0
’ it said : ‘ @entity27 may conduct an investigation where there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that there is an agreement which has as its object or effect the prevention , restriction or distortion of competition within the @entity41 and / or the @entity190			2
‘ @entity27 will consider whether there is a breach of the @entity41 and / or @entity190 competition law prohibition on agreements and decisions which restrict or distort competition			2
’ the regulator said it will discuss any change n the rules that leads to a change to saturday afternoon football			0
it said : ‘ @entity27 understands that the scheduling of football games is important to many football fans , in particular attending 3pm kick - offs on saturdays			1
the investigation will take this into account and @entity27 plans to approach the @entity29 and certain other supporters ’ groups to understand their views			0
’ the @entity4 said : ‘ the @entity4 currently sells its audio - visual rights in a way that is compatible with @entity41 and @entity190 competition law and will continue to do so			0
‘ we will be able to demonstrate that as part of this process			0

move could cut monthly subscriptions and lead to rise in games shown live
but it would reduce number of matches that kick - off at 3pm on a saturday
it would mean more games are played on friday and monday evenings
@entity27 is *due* to consult with fans following complaint from @entity36
