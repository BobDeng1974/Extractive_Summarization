shops are full of red dresses this year , so should you be tempted to trade in your lbd for an @entity4 ? it ’s a colour that radiates energy and sexiness , but that can all be wrecked if the style does n’t suit you			1
we asked @entity11 to try six looks to see which work — and which absolutely do n’t			1
the unattractive shade of orangey - red is made worse by the colour of the underslip — a queasy pale peach			1
its weight suggests that it ’s reinforced concrete and while thick fabric can smooth problem areas , here it bulges at the waist			1
the shallow v - neck does n’t enhance my bust , the sash creates matronliness and the asymmetric lace around the neckline looks torn			1
0/5 it could be designer dress , £ 150 , @entity41 at @entity19 @entity42 , £ 255 , lucychoilondon.com the lipstick red shade complements pale and deeper skin tones			1
the ruched style is reminiscent of @entity47 ’s famous bandage dresses , insofar as the fabric stretches to flatter just where it ’s needed			1
my 36dd bust means that a bateau neckline usually creates a gigantic shelf of bosom , but the sheer panel on this stylish dress is an ingenious solution			1
4/5 @entity59 - @entity58 dress , £ 89 , divacatwalk.com @entity42 , £ 395 , carlopazolini.com several celebs turn to this @entity64 brand ’s curve - hugging designs , with @entity65 a devotee			1
this dress looks great on the hanger and i ca n’t wait to try it on			2
the fit is divine and the dress feels marvellous			2
the hourglass silhouette has me embracing my inner @entity74 from @entity75			2
4/5 @entity76 dress , £ 265 , thefoldlondon.com shoes , £ 575 , biondacastana.com it is difficult to overstate how utterly horrible this looks on the hanger — a drearily shapeless , nondescript sack			2
imagine my amazement at the transformation once it ’s on			2
the fit is great , with a length that does wonders for your legs , and the cowl neck provides just enough detail to prevent my bust from creating a vista of bare chest			0
4/5 one - shoulder superstar dress , £ 189 , gorgeouscouture.com a floor - length gown is not top of my must - haves			0
but it ’s always good to have a dress in the wardrobe that makes you feel a knockout			0
one - shoulder designs create glamour , and in this case the broader band of fabric at the shoulder flatters the exposed arm			0
draping and ruching will flatter any figure , and the dress is helped by a body - hugging underslip			0
‘ very @entity116 , ’ said an onlooker			0
5/5 @entity117 dress , £ 48 , @entity118 heels , £ 195 , lkbennett.com first the good news : this crimson colour scores highly for drama , no matter what your skin tone or hair colour			0
next , the fit , which is fabulous over my hips and waist , but less so in the bodice			0
in my case another reason to fear the ultra-plunge neckline is that sensitive skins can become blotchy in the decolletage area when we are too hot			0
in any case , there is so much going on it ’s easy to be drowned in all the detail			0

the shops are full of red dresses in all shapes and shades this year
so , is it time to switch from our *trusty* lbds to a @entity4 for the *summer* ?
@entity11 tried six red looks to see which work and which do *n't*
