@entity0 , a researcher at @entity1 , says the @entity2 should close its borders to travelers from @entity6 - afflicted nations a top epidemiologist is speaking out to say the @entity2 must stop all commercial flights from @entity6 - stricken @entity10 nations in order to prevent more outbreaks on @entity2 soil			1
@entity0 , a @entity14 - educated academic who has been nationally recognized for his research on the spread of infectious diseases , says the bungling public health response to @entity2 @entity6 patient @entity19 proves that the country can not afford another case			1
@entity19 had contact with 100 people in his short time in the @entity2 before he was admitted to a hospital			1
nearly half of them are still under observation			0
writing in the @entity28 , dr @entity0 argues : ' the human errors in this single case highlight why it is urgent that we ban all commercial flights from the impacted countries to all non-affected countries until the outbreak is contained			1
' dr @entity0 , the dean of the @entity37 and @entity38 at @entity1 in @entity39 , @entity40 , is one of the first experts to publicly call for the @entity2 to close its borders to @entity10			1
@entity2 officials have refused to close @entity2 borders to travelers from @entity46 , @entity47 and @entity48 - the three countries where @entity6 continues to spread like wildfire			1
on friday , @entity52 director @entity51 said closing to borders to @entity54 would only make the @entity6 outbreak worse by cutting off the supply of aide and strangling the local economies			1
no @entity2 airlines fly to @entity46 , @entity47 or @entity48 , but @entity60 and other @entity62 carriers are still offering service from the @entity10 capitals			2
@entity19 flew from @entity65 , @entity46 , to @entity66 then boarded to @entity68 flight to @entity69 , where he was allowed to enter the country			2
he then flew to @entity71 and days later began experiencing symptoms of @entity6			0
he is now in critical condition at a @entity71 hospital			0
@entity75 is becoming increasingly uneasy with the open borders and lawmakers are beginning to make public calls to close @entity2 borders to travelers from the @entity6 - afflicted nations			1
dr @entity0 argues that screening to prevent people infected with @entity6 from coming into the country is inadequate			1
currently , travelers are only screened in @entity10 before they leave			0
nearly 7,500 people have been infected with @entity6 in @entity10 and nearly 3,500 have died of the disease			1
the outbreak remains active only in @entity46 ( pictured ) , @entity47 and @entity48 bungled response : @entity19 was sent home from the hospital when he was first admitted			2
then , it took days for anyone to remove his infected garments from the @entity71 apartment where he was staying president @entity95 announced on monday that new measures would be installed to screen travelers fro @entity6 before they enter the @entity2			2
however , the disease has a 21 - day incubation period , meaning that travelers who know they 're infected could easily pass through security without showing any signs			0
@entity19 is accused of lying to airport screeners in @entity65 and claiming he had no contact with anyone afflicted with the disease			0
dr @entity0 says this kind of behavior is only reasonable , given the dire situation at many hospitals in the @entity10 nations , which are among the poorest in the world			2
' if they stay in @entity10 , the probability that they will survive the illness if they have it is quite low			0
if they make it to the @entity2 , they can expect to receive the best medical care the world can provide , and they will have a much higher probability of survival , ' he writes			0
' so they are motivated to lie about their exposure status ( would nâ€™t you , in their shoes ? ) to airlines and public health officials and travel to the @entity2			0
' dr @entity0 argues that commercial airlines are n't the only way to get aide into @entity46			0
the @entity2 military could easily transport supplies and people to the three nations and help contain the disease .			0

@entity0 , a @entity14 - educated disease researcher , has argued that the bungled handling of the @entity19 case proves the @entity2 must close its borders to keep @entity6 out of the country
he is one of the first experts to advocate the closing of borders
the @entity52 *maintains* that blocking flights from @entity10 would make the @entity6 outbreak there worse by *hurting* the local economy
