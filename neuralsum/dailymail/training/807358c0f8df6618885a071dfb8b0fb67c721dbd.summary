this is the game that the national team can not and will not lose			2
once again , they have a point to prove			0
@entity4 have become increasingly defiant in recent visits to @entity6 , but it is unthinkable that @entity9 's side will undermine their heroic victory over @entity11 in @entity12 eight days ago by succumbing to an upset in this second instalment of their @entity16 campaign			1
on that basis the focus shifts			0
what took place at the @entity21 was a be-all and end - all encounter with no wider context required			2
this time , against a country @entity28 have never lost to , the players will be well aware of the need to keep the bigger picture in mind			1
if these opponents do n't generate sufficient edge and focus , the ticking of the clock should do the trick			0
@entity28 scrum half @entity37 ( left ) is calling on his side to maintain the intensity they showed in @entity12 @entity42 is impressing for @entity28 but there are plenty of high quality locks to come back from injury @entity47 ( left ) has improved his kicking game this season while @entity50 has excelled on the wing the scenario was neatly summed up by scrum - half @entity37 , who said : ' as a team , week by week , we have to push on			1
every game is a dress rehearsal for a @entity57			2
@entity4 is a dress rehearsal for a home @entity57			1
' we 've only got seven games before the first game against @entity63 so there are only so many dress rehearsals left and everyone wants to put their hand up and stake a claim			2
' such an outlook is crucial to quell any threat of @entity73 complacency on saturday afternoon			0
while the result may not be in doubt , the manner of the performance will speak volumes for whether the @entity80 fanfare of optimism has been justified			0
455 : @entity4 ’s hugely experienced starting xv have 405 more caps than @entity28 ’s line - up			1
15 : @entity28 have won all 15 @entity16 matches between the two sides since @entity4 ’s inclusion in the tournament in 2000			1
3 : for only the third time in his time in charge @entity28 head coach @entity9 has the luxury of naming an unchanged starting xv			1
on this occasion , maturity will be gauged in the ability to display a ruthless streak ; by taking charge against inferior rivals and by clinically dispatching them			0
on @entity103 , the hordes at @entity102 will expect a massacre and while that is unlikely , they can reasonably demand an emphatic margin — eventually			0
@entity28 have abundant firepower at their disposal , whereas @entity4 will be physical and resolute , but typically limited			1
the build - up has been dominated by a determined attempt to avoid a drop - off in intensity , after the high - stakes opener in hostile territory			2
@entity115 has put the disappointment of the november series behind him and his showing great form @entity37 is alert to the danger of easing off the throttle , saying : ' that is the biggest challenge , to maintain the levels of performance from last week			0
that is one of the things we have focused on			0
last time we played @entity4 at home , it was 18 - 11			1
that reinforces the fact that if you are not right on it , they will cause you problems			0
we have to back up everything we did last weekend			0
' @entity28 's players know they must be patient			1
that will require another demonstration of the composure which characterised their triumph at the @entity21 , when an early 10 - 0 deficit was taken in stride , rather than prompting @entity145 's players to go into headless - chicken mode			1
captain @entity147 led the steady , unflustered revival , and many of those who instigated the fightback showed maturity beyond their years			2
@entity28 props @entity154 ( left ) and @entity155 have big shifts ahead of them against the @entity4 pack all around there were 20 - somethings keeping their heads and today their challenge will be to avoid clumsy haste as they search for the @entity165 jugular			1
the man tasked with leading the attacking onslaught is @entity168 — the precocious 21 - year - old @entity169 who is thriving at @entity171 after emerging at @entity172			2
@entity37 is in awe of his half - back partner 's qualities			1
reflecting on the fly - half 's breakthrough with the @entity172 , he said : ' i was pleased he was a 10 , not a nine , otherwise i might have been the one moving ! ' i was fortunate enough to see him come through from the academy at @entity172 into the first team and watch him kick on			1
i do n't think i 'll see another guy like that come through the system , until i retire			0
' he 's just so mature for his age , in the way he plays ; you 'd think he has played more tests than he has			2
he is still only 21 , but you would n't think that when you speak to him and see him around the camp			0
guys like that are very rare			0
' @entity194 is not the only rare gem available to @entity28			1
@entity197 's try - scoring contribution in @entity12 re-emphasised his class as a fast and elusive centre amid the heavy midfield traffic , while @entity50 — who also touched down — is delivering on his immense promise as a potent force out wide			1
right at the back , @entity47 's kicking game has given him and his national team a whole new dimension			1
but for these men to thrive , the @entity28 pack must withstand @entity4 's imposing forwards			1
that surely wo n't be a problem for a national team who could field two separate eight - man units of elite @entity216 pedigree			2
just as @entity197 and @entity194 in the back line must continue to prosper in order to ward off the threat from challengers for their shirts , the same is true up front			0
every man who starts today has someone breathing down it			0
@entity155 is on a roll as the starting loosehead prop , but he has @entity228 and @entity229 keeping him honest			0
the situation is identical for hooker @entity231 , @entity232 at blindside flanker and for no 8 @entity115 while soon , when the injury backlog eases , there will be a jostle for places in the second row too			0
that is the @entity57 factor today			0
above and beyond beating @entity4 , to maintain their title quest , @entity28 's players know that the audition phase is intensifying			1
the time to make a good impression is running out .			0

@entity28 have won all 15 @entity16 matches between the two sides since @entity4 ’s inclusion in the tournament in 2000
@entity9 's side were pushed all the way by @entity4 at @entity6 two years ago before seeing out the game 18 - 11
competition for places is driving *standards* up in the squad
