health secretary @entity4 has questioned if it is appropriate to give free health care to short - term visitors migrants from the @entity2 could be charged for seeing a gp , put to the bottom of the council house queue and denied access to benefits among emergency measures being drawn up by ministers			1
a squeeze on access to the @entity16 , taxpayer - subsidised housing and welfare is being considered as part of a package designed to limit the number of people who come from @entity23 and @entity24 when controls are lifted at the end of this year			1
however , @entity28 confirmed that to comply with @entity2 law , restrictions would have to apply at least in principle to @entity32 citizens too – raising the prospect of people having to prove their eligibility to access services			1
@entity37 , @entity38 mp for @entity39 , said : ‘ what a pity that having failed to adequately control our own borders , we are now having to put up frontiers to our public services			1
‘ had we managed to control who was coming in to our country , we would not need to be rationing access to our benefits			1
this will mean @entity32 people will have to effectively carry the equivalent of an identity card to access public services			1
’ @entity55 general secretary @entity54 said : ‘ the government must spell out its plans in full detail and come clean on which people living in the @entity32 will lose out			1
’ the most drastic step being considered is to make key benefits dependent on how long applicants have lived and worked here			1

government sources played down the possibility of an ‘ entitlement card ’ that would be required to access @entity97 care			1
one said : ‘ we do n’t want to do anything that would look like @entity131 cards by the back door			0
’ however , it is likely to be a requirement that students and migrants who claim they are ‘ self - sufficient ’ , meaning they are not coming looking immediately for work , have to have private medical insurance			1
those who wanted to see a gp or have non-emergency treatment on the @entity97 would be charged			1
@entity38 mp @entity110 and former @entity109 welfare minister @entity108 , joint chairmen of a cross-party group on migration , said : ‘ we warmly welcome the news that the government are looking closely at access by new arrivals both to the @entity97 and to social housing			1

we have also urged the housing minister to make the recording of nationality compulsory for new lets			0
’ transitional arrangements in place since 2005 , which restrict the rights of 29million @entity23 and @entity24 citizens to live and work in other @entity2 states , will expire in december			1
campaign group @entity165 has claimed that as many as 250,000 could arrive over the next five years			0

minister without portfolio @entity177 warned his colleagues not to play up ‘ fanciful fears ’ being stoked by @entity180			0
he added : ‘ some of the things that have been canvassed around i do n’t recognise as government policy or anything likely to be adopted by a @entity38 that i recognise			0
’ some @entity2 nations find it easier to restrict access to benefits than the @entity32			1
many use id cards , which make it easy to check whether a migrant is resident without discriminating , because all citizens have to carry cards			2

@entity197 out of work benefits : usually not payable until someone has lived in @entity197 for at least six months			2
