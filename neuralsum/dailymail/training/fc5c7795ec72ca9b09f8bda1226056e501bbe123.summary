still smiling ? @entity0 , chief executive of @entity1 , does not know if all @entity3 security staff will be able to speak @entity4 having been forced to apologise for failing to recruit enough @entity5 security staff @entity8 's boss was left red - faced again today after he admitted he had no idea if those who are working could speak @entity4			1
asked whether all the security guards the company had recruited could speak fluent @entity4 , chief executive @entity0 said it was a ' difficult question to answer '			1
he added : ' i am pretty sure that they can , but i ca n’t say categorically as i sit here today			0
' later asked the same question by @entity18 mr @entity0 said : ' as part of the @entity21 ( @entity21 ) training and as part of the @entity21 certification you have to be able to speak @entity4			2
that ’s the standard for the @entity27 security industry			0
' the @entity8 supremo 's latest revelation follows his apology for failing to provide enough security for the games - causing the army to be drafted in to plug the hole			1
mr @entity0 , who earns £ 1.2million a year , said accepted full responsibility for the fiasco over providing guards for the @entity5 and has today confirmed the penalty payment would be in the range of £ 10million to £ 20million as a result of the firm ’s failure to meet its commitments			1
in a statement late last night , the company disclosed that it stood to lose up to £ 50 million on its £ 284 million contract with the @entity48 organisers , @entity49 , as a result of the fiasco			0
it said it ‘ deeply regrets ’ the mistakes which led to 3,500 servicemen being summoned at the 11th hour to plug gaps in its @entity5 security operation			1
the admission apparently followed heated discussions with furious @entity59 officials			0
today @entity8 has said it will meet the full cost of deploying thousands of extra troops to the @entity5 after it failed to supply sufficient numbers of security guards			1
however mr @entity0 said that the bulk of the loss would come from paying the @entity66 to supply 3,500 additional troops to make up the shortfall			1
' we accept that we underestimated the task of supplying staff for the @entity5			1
we deeply regret that , ' mr @entity0 told the @entity73 4 today programme			2
despite having signed the initial contract in 2010 , mr @entity0 said that he had only realised ' eight or nine days ago ' that there would be a shortfall in the numbers			1
' we are recruiting a large number of people , they are all working through a process of interview , two or three different degrees of training , licensing , accreditation , ' he said			0
reinforcements : police patrol the @entity88 near the @entity89 in a powerboat			0
they will be providing extra security and emergency responses if anything happens ' our review process was around the number of people applying for interviews , we had 100,000 of those , the number of people interviewed which was 50,000			2
' so basically you work through that process of numbers and as they were getting ready for deployment over a period of time , it ’s only when you get closer and closer to the @entity48 that your realise that the number is n’t as high as you expect			0
' the @entity111 has also revealed police would also have to deploy several hundred extra officers to do work which should have been done by @entity8 guards			1
senior police officers welcomed @entity8 ’s apology , but privately expressed fears that it was ‘ too little and too late ’			2
@entity8 said it accepted responsibility for the additional cost of the increased military deployment			2
it is the first open acknowledgement by chief executive @entity0 that the world ’s largest security provider has dismally failed in its obligations to provide 10,000 staff for @entity3 venues since news of the recruitment scandal emerged on wednesday			1
‘ the company is also incurring other significant costs as it endeavours to meet the contract challenges , ’ the firm admitted			0
‘ whilst it is not possible to gauge the precise financial impact , it is estimated that the company will incur a loss on the contract in the range of £ 35 million to £ 50 million , all of which will fall in the current financial year			2
’ call up : extra police have been drafted in to fill the gaps in @entity5 security caused by blundering private firm @entity8 it is understood the deduction in pay for the @entity5 work will take @entity8 out of profit on the @entity48 contract			1
in its statement , @entity8 said it had run into difficulties in processing applicants in sufficient numbers through the necessary training and vetting procedures in what it described as ‘ an extremely complex workforce supply contract ’ on an ‘ unprecedented scale ’			2
‘ as a result , we will be unable to deliver all of the necessary workforce numbers , ’ it said			0
‘ we have worked very closely with @entity49 throughout the build up			0
at the point we felt that we could no longer assure the scale of the security workforce we had committed to , we advised them of the situation			0
’ mr @entity0 , who has been summoned to give evidence before the @entity173 next tuesday , said : ‘ we are deeply disappointed that we have not been able to fully deliver against our contract with @entity49 and that it has been necessary to call upon the additional military personnel			2
in partnership with the military and @entity49 , we are working flat out around the clock to resolve the situation			0
we are determined that together we will deliver a successful and secure games			0
’ @entity182 , @entity8 chairman , added : ‘ it is a significant disappointment to everyone at the @entity185 that we have fallen short of our obligations			0
’ debacle : the officers will join an additional 3,500 troops who have been drafted in to help protect the olympic park as the apology was released , the @entity111 learnt that several hundred extra police are to be drafted into the @entity5 security operation to fill the gaps caused by the blundering private firm			1
it comes only two days after 3,500 troops had to be called up to help protect the @entity198 latest move is a major embarrassment to home secretary @entity200 , who is coming under increasing pressure over her handling of the affair			1
a senior security source said : ‘ behind the scenes , some senior officers are seething			0
they have lost confidence in @entity8 and are angry that they have been left to pick up the pieces			0
’ @entity209 admitted earlier this week it might not be able to provide enough guards , resulting in the @entity211 being called in			2
now , amid fears @entity8 will still not be able to provide anywhere near the revised number of security guards it has promised for the @entity48 , police chiefs have been forced to put hundreds of extra officers on @entity5 duties			1
on guard : two @entity221 men show off their sniper rifles as the their helicopter hovers over @entity224 as part of the @entity3 security effort a total of 17,000 servicemen and women will now be involved in the @entity5 , including 11,800 soldiers , 2,600 sailors and marines , and 2,600 airmen they are expected to carry out basic functions such as guarding entrances , and possibly searching spectators and bags			2
around 12,000 officers were already due to be on duty across the @entity3 venues on peak days , but this figure is now likely to top @entity244 decision to call in extra police was seen as a sign of the complete lack of confidence senior officers have in @entity8			1
@entity251 chief superintendent @entity250 said : ‘ i suspect a number of senior officers who , with their teams , have worked very hard preparing for the @entity5 will feel very disappointed at being let down at such a late stage by a private security firm			1
’ a total of 17,000 servicemen and women will now be involved in the @entity5 , including 11,800 soldiers , 2,600 sailors and marines , and 2,600 airmen			0
some 11,000 of these will be involved in the security of more than 30 sporting venues and some 70 non-competition venues , including car parks and hotels , while others will carry out specialist support roles			0
overall , the security force for the @entity48 will include a mix of military , private security guards and more than 2,000 unpaid @entity5 volunteers			1

a former employee told @entity294 the company knew in january that there would be serious problems reaching the new level of 10,000 @entity3 security staff – a figure revised up from 2,000 by @entity5 organisers @entity49 in december			1
@entity8 has not yet responded to the whistleblower ’s allegations			0
