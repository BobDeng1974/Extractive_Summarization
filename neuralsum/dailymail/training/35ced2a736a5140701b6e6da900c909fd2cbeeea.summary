by @entity0 published : 15:49 est , 10 march 2014 updated : 17:39 est , 10 march 2014 it is an advertising slogan that has stood the test of time , and made its way into the consciousness of an entire nation			0
but the days of baking giants mr @entity9 referring to its cakes as ' exceedingly good ' could be coming to an end amidst a multi-million pound rebrand			1
the famous phrase , which featured in some way in virtually every tv advert , poster and piece of packaging since 1967 , could be scrapped as the brand draws up new designs and shifts its focus towards individual ' snack pack ' items			2
classic : the ' exceedingly good ' catchphrase has been featured for decades			2
the advert above aired in 1985 enduring : the phrase , first used in 1967 , helped make mr @entity9 the nation 's biggest cake - maker			1
@entity31 is an advert continuing the tradition in 1997 @entity34 , the chief executive of @entity35 , which owns the @entity37 brand , said he was ' on the verge ' of replacing the slogan as part of £ 20million of new investment			1
when asked whether the phrase - which is sometimes spoken by the mysterious mr @entity9 and sometimes about him - could be dropped , he said : ' it 's possible			1
well , we 'll see			0
we 're on the verge of agreeing the tv commercial			0
mr @entity9 's range including bakewell tarts and fruit slices , have been the bestselling cake brand in @entity51 for almost 40 years			1
earlier ads centred on mr @entity9 , a kindly uncle figure , inviting people to his house to test his new creations which were , invariably , dubbed ' exceedingly good '			1
the original voice featured in the article belonged to @entity58 's , who died of cancer in 1996			0
his ten - year stint on the commercial saw sales boom			0
at time of his death , long - time friend @entity63 said : ' everyone called him mr @entity9 and his voice was his trademark			1
he had a successful career and was much more than just a voice			0
' @entity70 : the brand 's packaging and style has gone through many changes , but has always retained the central phrase			2
pictured above is a 2012 version beloved : the phrase has worked its way into the popular imagination , thanks to its long - running association			0
@entity31 is mr @entity9 packaging bearing the slogan in 2003 seasonal : variants of the phrase were used for other products , such as these 2004 mince pies later versions , including a 1984 @entity90 ad , saw mr @entity9 made the victim of his own success when so many carol singers gathered at his house , lured in by his mince pies , that he could n't get them to leave			1
the campaigns took a more humorous direction in the early 2000s , which saw mr @entity9 made into a more accident - prone figure			1
despite making gaffes including filling a bouncy castle with helium so that it flew away , and making a live birth the centrepiece of a nativity play , mr @entity9 was forgiven because of the quality of his baking			1
the man himself has never been pictured in any of the adverts , though occasional silhouettes have featured			0
six in ten @entity51 households bought a mr @entity9 product last year			1
# heritage : the slogan survived into the social media age , as seen in the advert from last @entity90 memories : strong feelings have been raised by the prospect of change from such a household brand , shown above in 1994 but a financial crisis at @entity35 , which also owns @entity124 and @entity125 , in the last few years has seen a lack of advertising and marketing budget spent on the brand			2
mr @entity34 added : ' the cake category is our focus for 2014			0
this has been the brand that 's been the casualty of @entity136 having no money			2
' it 's a £ 1billion category and we 've invested almost nothing in advertising and very little in new product development			2
' ' we 're going to have new packaging , new advertising and doubling of our capacity to produce mr @entity9 snack packs , which is where we 're getting a lot of our growth			2
' but fans of the cakes have already taken to social media sites to voice their anger at the dropping of the slogan			0
one said : ' that famous voice and advertising slogan very often made me buy mr @entity9 cakes			1
abandoning it seems unnecessary ( and therefore unwise )			0
' another said : ' @entity35 ' senior managers are a bunch of t * * spots			0
they have no idea of the value of their intellectual property			0

mr @entity9 cakes first described as ' exceedingly good ' in 1967
practically every advertisement since has used the phrase or a variant
chief executive of mr @entity9 's parent *company* says it could be dropped
comes amidst a £ 20million raft of changes to the household brand
