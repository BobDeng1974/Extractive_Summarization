by @entity0 published : 21:25 est , 28 june 2012 updated : 22:10 est , 28 june 2012 when garden enthusiast @entity2 planted a rare wild flower display on a roadside near her home , she had hoped the colourful gesture would brighten up the grass verge for decades to come			1
but she had not reckoned with workmen from her local council who - despite the display flourishing for ten years - opted to destroy the swathe of meadow flowers by mowing them all down			1
former @entity16 in @entity18 judge @entity17 , planted the pretty display with a group of friends to brighten up the verge of the @entity23 in @entity24 , @entity25 , in 2002			1
hacked off : @entity2 nurtured the flower display for a decade , only for council workmen to mow it down in bloom : other sections of the same road in @entity24 have remained untouched and make a colourful addition to the roadside the retired shopkeeper recruited friends and spent hours planting the meadow flowers , having been inspired by similar verges in @entity37 and @entity38			1
but 10 years after the wild display was unveiled , contractors working for @entity40 destroyed the entire bank in just two hours			1
thousands of flowers were hacked down including hundreds which were designated as ‘ rare ’			1
@entity17 yesterday raged against the local authority for ' decimating ' the flowers			2
she said : ' we wanted the roads to be strewn with wild flowers and we were trying to bring something new to @entity24			2
' we took inspiration from around the world , with wild flowers blooming in @entity37 and @entity38			2
' i am disappointed and saddened by the decimation of the wild flowers on the road			0
' a few years ago , a very small dedicated group of people , encouraged by the highways department of @entity61 , were leaders in this conservation project			1
' we used to do the @entity24 in @entity18 and the civic awards , so i ca n’t understand why have these flowers been destroyed			0
' @entity17 , from @entity24 , and her group of friends raised hundreds of pounds for the seeds by selling wheelbarrows in 2002			0
cut down in their prime : @entity17 said the rare flowers she had planted ten years ago were just starting to flourish when they were hacked down by the council cut down in their prime : @entity17 said the rare flowers she had planted ten years ago were just starting to flourish when they were hacked down by the council among the flowers they planted were hare bells and bluebells - which were only just becoming well - established when they were cut down			1
the grandmother - of - two added : ' we raised money to buy the seeds , grew the plants ourselves and spent many hours planting them along the grassy banks			0
' it was a spectacularly colourful display of meadow flowers which received much admiration			2
' ' it is very poor if they are going to destroy them			0
i think it is sad to see and that whole area looks so barren			0
' a council spokesman said : ' @entity99 ’ grass cutting policy must strike a balance between maintaining natural roadside environments and ensuring the roads are visibly safe for motorists			0
' we do not disregard wild flowers and @entity107 highways are currently investigating this complaint			0
' our policy on grass cutting along urban roads requires @entity107 to cut verges to a higher standard , once a fortnight , during the summer months , to keep areas tidy			0

@entity2 planted rare flowers on roadside ten years ago
but @entity40 ' decimated ' pretty display by mowing it down just as flowers were flourishing
