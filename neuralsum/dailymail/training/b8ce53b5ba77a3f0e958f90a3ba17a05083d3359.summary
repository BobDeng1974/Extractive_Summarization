the @entity10 ' trip south was nearly scuppered when their team coach failed to show up , meaning players and staff had to make their own way to the ground			2
the tactics board did n't make the cut , which led to @entity18 marking out a 4 - 2 - 4 formation using the sweets on top of a kit locker			1
improvisation : striker @entity24 posted the picture of the makeshift tactics board on @entity27 striker @entity24 took a photo behind the manager 's shoulder and tweeted ' funny tactics '			2
those tactics certainly gave @entity3 plenty to chew on as @entity0 emerged 2 - 1 winners			1
after the match @entity18 told @entity36 : ' if we can keep winning i will do whatever is necessary			0
' the club are looking into the reason why the team coach did not turn up for the @entity44 clash			0
' we turned up in drips and drabs a little bit , but we all got down , ' said @entity18			0
' it was n't the best situation to be in , especially when you are going to the league leaders that have n't conceded a goal , and had got off to an absolutely unbelievable start			0
