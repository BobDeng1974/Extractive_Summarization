when it came to explaining the birds and the bees - photographer @entity0 decided to do things a bit differently			1
during the nine months of his wife @entity6 ' pregnancy , the couple posed for this hilarious set of pictures to chart their joyous journey to parenthood			1
they show @entity0 pretending to plug an air pump at a garage into his wife 's belly button			2
step one : find yourself an air pump and attach to your wife 's belly button step two : turn on the power and let the magic begin step three : things are starting to progress and @entity6 is well on her way as @entity6 's belly swells , @entity0 cowers in the corner until finally baby @entity32 explodes into life			0
the couple then share a tender moment with their new born wrapped in a leather jacket			0
with each picture arranged in exactly the same way - it gives the impression that @entity6 's stomach has been filled with air until out pops a baby			0
step four : @entity0 is starting to look worried as @entity6 appears almost ready to burst @entity47 ! the journey as reached an explosive conclusion those who look carefully might spot a few continuity errors that give the game away - such as @entity0 's sunglasses and the disappearance of snow from the ground			1
but otherwise the project - which @entity0 has entitled ' how to make a baby ' - looks utterly convincing			1
the unique and clever sequence is not only a great way to celebrate the birth of their child - it 's also sure to bring a smile to even the gloomiest of faces			0
good catch : @entity0 has to be alert as baby @entity32 flies into his arms happy ending : the couple enjoy a tender moment with their new - born wrapped up in a leather jacket			2
