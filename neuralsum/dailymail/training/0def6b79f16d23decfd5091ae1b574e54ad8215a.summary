others who lost out included @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25			0

fresh look : @entity46 , pictured at @entity48 race course , and racing @entity50 analyst @entity49 ( right ) are part of @entity42 's revamped line - up ' i am no longer a member of the group			2
' @entity2 's famous statement after refusing to take part in @entity58 tasks ' you do nothing round here			0
you 're completely wrapped up in yourself			0
' to @entity62 during @entity34 ' in the last couple of days before the deadline was extended i would have said it was in the death throes and time for the last rites			0
now it is on life support with a bit of blinking going on			0
' a bleak prediction about the future of racing continuing on @entity3 in june 2005 ' a body to die for ... i think she would be a terrible lay ' on caprice during celebrity @entity79 ‘ for loss of future earnings , unfair career damaging , public humiliation , stress and mental anguish , i will be seeking £ 500,000			1

he will have supporters but others will question his judgment			0
