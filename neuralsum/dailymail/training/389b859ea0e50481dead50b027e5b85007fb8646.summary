by @entity0 the complex structure of transport networks across the world 's major cities has been laid strikingly bare in a series of maps that plot taxi journeys			1
but in addition to unveiling how residents navigate their cities , the maps also highlight the contrast between rich , tech - savvy areas with the less affluent neighbourhoods			1
the maps have been released by taxi firm @entity16 to celebrate the service launching in @entity18 - bringing the total number of cities on the scheme to 100			1
as part of the @entity16 project , the @entity23 - based firm has plotted the major routes its drivers take across all of these cities , including @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 , and more			1
taxi firm @entity16 has launched in @entity18 , taking its total number of cities to 100			1
to celebrate , the firm has created the @entity16 project and plotted the major routes from all of these cities on to maps			1
this includes @entity35 , pictured , which has a spider - like reach with legs reaching around the city centre , shown in bright blue @entity48 is a smartphone taxi app that lets people hail a cab from their phone			1
it lets users compare rates and add credit cards to an account so they do n't need cash			0
the service launched in @entity60 in 2010 and has grown from 35 cities last summer to a century this month			1
' in 2010 , @entity48 started as simply a big idea for a better way to get around , ' said @entity48			0
' with today 's launch in @entity18 - four years and millions of trips later - we 're now moving people in 100 cities around the world			1
' as a result , it is used by people who can afford smartphones in the first place , but also afford the taxi journeys , and this give a clear indication of economic differences			2
@entity48 's own stats also reveal the majority of its users are around 30			2
@entity30 , pictured , has the most sprawling and far - reaching map in @entity48 's collection			1
the two black sections in among the complex blue lines is the pedestrianised @entity87			0
as expected , the centre of the city is shown in bright blue , but there is also a hub of activity to the east of the capital towards the @entity97 venue in @entity98			0
the straggly lines to the west are the major routes to @entity102			1
lines are paler as they approach the suburbs , especially passed @entity105 and towards @entity106 @entity31 's distinctive shape is instantly recognisable in the @entity16 map of the @entity110 city , as is the economic split			1
the brightest , and therefore busiest , stretches of the city are in @entity114 , especially around @entity115			0
the lines become thinner towards @entity117 , and the poorer neighbourhoods of the @entity119			2
elsewhere , @entity121 's sparse lines almost fade into the background			0
there is additionally a hub on @entity125 , and on @entity126 that surrounds the neighbourhood , but not in inner @entity125 @entity33 's map looks like an elongated face , with the @entity130 blocking out the eyes , @entity132 representing the nose and the @entity134 appearing to be an open mouth			1
bright blue lines plot the popular port hotspots in the southeast of the city			0
the map also reveals the major routes into and out of the city and highlights the relatively few journeys made across the @entity144 to the suburbs the cities are marked as nodes and plotted on a larger map of the world			1
clicking on a node lets you download the map for that city			0
as expected , the busiest and most affluent locations within these major cities are typically in the centre , and around the airport			1
the suburbs where house prices are typically cheaper , and residents are older - based on figures from the @entity162 - have much few journeys and appear pale in comparison to the bright blue centres			0
@entity30 has the most sprawling and far - reaching map in @entity48 ’s collection			1
the two black sections in among the complex blue lines is the pedestrianised area of @entity87 , while @entity172 and @entity173 are blacked out further north			0
as expected , the centre of the city is shown in bright blue , but there is also a hub of activity to the east of the capital towards the @entity97 venue in @entity98			0
the straggly lines to the west are the major routes to @entity102			1
lines are paler as they approach the suburbs , especially passed @entity105 and towards @entity106			0
elsewhere , roads around the @entity189 and @entity190 in the centre of the @entity32 map , pictured , are a wave of bright blue , as is @entity194			1
it is particularly bright in the affluent regions of @entity197 above the harbour , and @entity199 to the east of the @entity201			1
the main routes of the @entity203 heading southwest and @entity204 trailing off to the northwest towards @entity206 frame the relatively sparse , poorer districts to the west including @entity209 and @entity210 while the maps of @entity31 and @entity23 show the regions as being very narrow , @entity211 , pictured , is much more flat and square with popular destinations shown as @entity215 and @entity216 on the coast			1
towards @entity219 and the southeast of the region , the lines fade			0
the map also highlights that @entity48 is mostly concentrated in the centre of @entity211 and is rarely used on further outside the area @entity31 ’s distinctive shape is instantly recognisable in the @entity16 map of the @entity110 city , as is the economic split			1

there is additionally a hub on @entity125 , and on @entity126 that surrounds the neighbourhood , but not in inner @entity125			0
as the @entity239 map shows , the majority of @entity16 users in the area travel short distances around the downtown area – highlighted by the bright blue mass in the centre			1
other popular areas of the coastal seaport include the roads above and around @entity250			0
the hilly and green terrain of @entity23 's west coast makes the city 's map , pictured , one of the most bare in the collection			2
curved lines of @entity258 and the @entity259 are in stark contrast to the grid system of the @entity262 and @entity263 in the north			0
a faint blue line at the top left of the map represents the @entity268 meanwhile , @entity34 's map , pictured , appears as a bullseye with the various ring roads that surround the @entity273 capital			2
it stretches out to the west , towards the wealthy districts of @entity277 and @entity278 but the lines fade to black as @entity48 journeys travel east , approaching the poorer region of @entity282 , for example meanwhile the outer lying districts including @entity285 and @entity286 in the west , as well as @entity287 , and the whole of @entity239 are practically desolate on the @entity16 maps			2

around @entity328 and down towards @entity329 the loops and bendy routes are also highlighted			0
@entity33 ’s map looks like an elongated face , with the @entity130 blocking out the eyes , @entity132 representing the nose and the @entity134 appearing to be an open mouth			2

can you guess which city is represented in this @entity16 map ? it appears to be a rural location but is in fact the bustling city of @entity36			1
it highlights the main coastal routes			0
the region is synonymous with one - way routes and congestion and as a result , many @entity367 use public transport rather than drive , or use the roads the brightest points are seen at junctions on these ring roads , especially in the south of the city towards @entity377			2
by highlighting the routes around @entity110 cities , it ’s interesting to see how much they vary in landscape			2
while @entity31 and @entity23 for example , are narrow , @entity211 is much more flat and square with popular destinations shown as @entity215 and @entity216 on the coast			1
towards @entity219 and the southeast of the region , the lines fade			0
the map also highlights that @entity48 is mostly concentrated in the centre of @entity211 and is rarely in outside , poorer or less populated neighbourhoods			0
and back to @entity394 , what appears to be a rural location is in fact the bustling city of @entity36			2
its map highlights the main coastal routes			0
the region is synonymous with one - way routes and congestion and as a result , many @entity367 use public transport rather than drive , or use the roads which may explain the pale blue lines .			2
