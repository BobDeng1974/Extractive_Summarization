@entity1 racing director @entity0 is hoping the team 's ' extreme ' new car can rack up the miles over the remaining two tests if they are to head into the new @entity7 season on a competitive footing			1
over the four days of the initial pre-season test in @entity13 last week drivers @entity10 and @entity11 completed a total of just 79 laps			1
with new power - unit partner @entity16 on board @entity1 were anticipating teething problems , and so it proved as there were numerous issues to contend with			2
drivers @entity10 and @entity11 give their thumbs up at the launch of the new @entity1 car the @entity1 - @entity26 was unveiled at the @entity27 on tuesday but there was no doom and gloom amongst the @entity1 hierarchy , nor with their illustrious driver pairing , but instead positivity they are progressing in the right direction			1
@entity0 appreciates for the remaining two tests at the @entity37 in @entity38 from february 19 - 22 and february 26 - march 1 , @entity1 now have to build to ensure they do not languish too far behind their rivals come the opening race in @entity41 on march 15			1
' with a new concept and engine partner , obviously the less we run the more difficult it 's going to be to catch up , or let 's say , the later we will be ready to compete , ' said @entity0			2
' every time we ca n't achieve all our targets in terms of mileage or development we push back the date where we are able to exploit 100 per cent of our car and our power unit to fight for the win			0
' @entity1 have pushed that development to the maximum with a tightly - packaged , streamlined rear that so far has ticked all the right boxes			1
' you can see yourself the back end of the car is quite amazing , ' added @entity0 ' the car is very small , something we embarked on with our partner to try for such a challenge			2
' we have also pushed the limit of the cooling , which means we can run hotter engines with smaller radiators and cooling system			0
' all this has resulted in a tinier car , one that is very extreme in terms of how small it is			0
' that is why it was a relief last week to see the car running with no cooling issues which is a concern when you go radical or extreme			0
' the new @entity1 completed just 79 laps in total at testing in @entity13 last week @entity11 drives ahead of the @entity86 of @entity87 at @entity13 earlier this month both @entity10 and @entity11 have already expressed confidence with the car , notably its stability under braking on entry into the corners , crucial for driver control			1
the only area of concern for @entity0 was seeing reigning champions @entity97 put on a virtual demonstration in @entity13 as @entity99 and @entity100 completed a record 450 laps for a first test			1
' what was frightening was the fact they did pit - stop training on the first day ! ' reflected @entity0			0
' their confidence level is very high			0
they had such an advantage in 2014 , i do n't see them failing in 2015			0
' the only thing you can expect , or hope , is that everybody closes the gap			0

@entity1 admit their new car needs work to be competitive next season
@entity10 and @entity11 completed just 79 laps in testing
