@entity0 have sent striker @entity1 to @entity2 to continue his rehabilitation from the thigh injury which has sidelined him for most of the season			1
the 25 - year - old has not played for the club since august 31 after he initially strained a thigh on international duty with @entity10			1
on the eve of his comeback he pulled a calf muscle in his first full training session back with the first team and just when he appeared to have got over that he sustained another , different , thigh injury which has ruled him out until the new year			1
25 - year - old @entity1 has not played for @entity0 since august and will be out until next year the striker first injured his thigh while on international duty with @entity10 earlier this season ankle ligaments - @entity10 v @entity22 may 2013 , returned for pre-season			1
ankle ligaments - december 2013			0
thigh - during @entity10 training , september 2014			1
calf - during @entity0 training , october 2014			1
thigh - during @entity0 training , november 2014			1
@entity30 manager @entity29 said last month that the club may have to look even deeper into the root of @entity1 's problems , of which this is the ninth separate but similar injury has had in his career , with the player suggesting the issue may be hereditary as his father , a trainee at @entity41 , and two uncles @entity43 and @entity44 - both professional footballers - also suffered the same problems			2
it is understood the striker has travelled to @entity49 to undergo warm - weather training and rehabilitation to help with his recovery for a fortnight			1
he has not gone to the @entity49 to have any medical treatment or procedure			0
@entity1 scores for @entity0 during their 2 - 1 victory over @entity57 on the first day of the season ' he has gone away to get some specific work in with some of our staff and he is coming along well , ' said @entity29			1
@entity1 's absence has been compounded by the failure of Â£ 16million summer signing @entity64 to pick up the slack having yet to score a @entity68 goal			2
he too came back injured from the last international break and has not been available since because of a groin problem , forcing @entity29 to pick @entity71 who has responded with two goals in his first two matches leading the line and has put in good performances in the two games since then			2
with @entity64 facing a possible @entity78 charge for posting an apparently anti-semetic and racist graphic on social media - for which he has until 6pm on friday to give his explanation to the @entity78 - the spotlight has only intensified on the troubled @entity84 international			2
@entity29 insists , however , that until the 24 - year - old is available to play he can not waste much time thinking about him			0
@entity64 is facing a possible @entity78 charge for posting an allegedly anti-semitic graphic on @entity90 ' he is a very much a @entity0 player but he is injured at the moment and there is not much more to add from me , ' he said			1
' he is not fit to play , my concentration at this moment is on players who are fit and available to play and that is my only thinking at the moment			0
' he is working with the medical team on a daily basis and i trust the team of people here to look after injuries			0
' at this moment in time the team is doing well and whenever he is back fit then we will see where he is at			0
' hopefully he will be available sooner rather than later			0
' @entity64 , laughing in the stands , has struggled to fill the void left by @entity1 's injury while the debate continues over @entity111 's future in light of the club 's contract offer , which he has not yet accepted , @entity29 has to concern himself with the more immediate issue associated with the midfielder			2
having previously admitted the 34 - year - old can not play three matches in a week , effectively the @entity30 boss has to decide whether to retain his captain in the starting line - up to face @entity122 on saturday or hold him back for tuesday 's must - win @entity124 tie at home to @entity127 , which is followed by a trip to @entity129 the following sunday			0
' the only focus is our next game but of course you are having to plan forward and look at one or two teams down the line , ' said @entity29 , who this week had to quash reports there had been a disagreement between him and @entity111			0
' if you rest someone they are rotated , if they are rotated they are dropped , if he is dropped he is left out so you ca n't win as a manager			0
' i 'll always pick a team which i think can win the game			0
