by @entity0 it does not look , or sound , particularly appetising			1
but after milkshakes and smoothies comes a new drink called @entity5 – and its inventors claim it could spell ‘ the end of food ’			1
invented by an @entity12 entrepreneur @entity11 , who was frustrated by the amount of time it takes to prepare and eat normal meals , it is claimed the drink contains all the necessary nutrition we need			1
to its first 30,000 customers , @entity5 comes in white boxes containing pouches of powder and small containers of oil			1
the future of nutrition ? entrepreneur @entity11 claims his powder the drink contains all the necessary nutrition we need			1
file picture mixing the two with water then gives the drinker 2,000 calories in liquid form , according its makers			2
it is claimed that essential fats come from canola oil , carbohydrates from a food additive called maltodextrin and oat flour , while rice provides the protein			2
vitamins , minerals and rich oils are added to the mix. mr @entity11 , a 25 - year - old software engineer , says the drink is ‘ delicious ’ and described traditional solid foodstuffs as the ‘ fossil fuel of human energy ’			1
but scientist have been expressing their doubts			2
@entity59 , a professor in enteric neuroscience at @entity61 , says ‘ all sorts of trace elements and phytochemicals , such as lycopene which is found in tomatoes , are missing ’ from @entity5			0
he says these elements are often found in plants and many are just beginning to be understood			0
lycopene , for example , has been linked to lower rates of prostate cancer			0
and he told a newspaper : ‘ there ’s the issue over the link between the efficient bacterial fermentation in the colon and cancer			0
obsolete ? the inventor described traditional solid foodstuffs as the ' fossil fuel of human energy ' ‘ everything in there is very finely balanced and out gut has evolved over millions of years , and if i even had a suspicion of a history of colon cancer , i ’d stay away from a product like this			1
’ he added : ‘ there is more and more work being done on the links between food and mood			0
‘ a shortcut like @entity5 throws all that out the window			0
‘ we have to remember comfort food is n’t just a luxury to spoil ourselves with , but something that scientifically , we are increasingly seeing as something that should be part of our daily life			0
