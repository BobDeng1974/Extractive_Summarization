two journalists from @entity54 - @entity53 and @entity55 - claimed that disgraced @entity51 vice-president @entity56 held a secret meeting with mr @entity7 shortly before the successful vote			2

conservative mp @entity107 , a former foreign minister , said : ‘ whilst i ’m not particularly in favour of cancelling sports events at the drop of a hat , here you ’ve had the murder of 298 citizens			0
' it ca n’t conceivably be defended as a reasonable act of war , and therefore i think that @entity14 should reflect that			0
