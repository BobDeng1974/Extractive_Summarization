universities minister @entity0 said student fees were a ' phenomenal investment ' a @entity4 minister has insisted £ 9,000 - a - year tuition fees are not too expensive – because it only costs the same as a ' posh coffee ' to pay them back every day			1
universities minister @entity0 said if graduates earn £ 30,000 a year they have to pay back £ 2.22 a day , which he claimed was a ' phenomenal investment '			1
@entity13 said the @entity16 - graduate 's ' bizarre ' remarks showed the government was out of touch with public concern over the cost of university			1
the @entity22 increased the cap on student fees from £ 3,000 to £ 9,000 a year to fill the hole in university funding left by cuts to the higher education budget			2
but , because student debts are written off after 30 years , just under half the money will never be recouped , meaning the scheme will cost the government £ 2.5billion a year more than ministers claimed , @entity30 library figures show			2
at the same time average graduate debts have doubled from £ 20,000 in 2010 to £ 43,500			0
@entity13 's wants to reduce the cap on fees to £ 6,000 a year before scrapping the system altogether and replacing it with a ' graduate tax ' on earnings			1
but mr @entity0 , who attended his local comprehensive in @entity41 before making his fortune in business after graduating with a phd in economics , said student fees were good value for money			2
the conservative minister , speaking at a science and engineering debate at the @entity52 last month , said : ' first of all it is important that we do n't distract from the fact that for students under the system that we have , if you have a great education you only pay back if you 're earning over £ 21,000 and only 9 per cent of your earnings above that			2
' what that means is if you earn £ 30,000 as a graduate you bay back £ 2.22 a day , now there are people who buy cups of posh coffee for less than that , and i think people recognise that that is a phenomenal investment , it 's not just a good investment for the student , but actually it 's a good investment for the taxpayer			1
' @entity13 's shadow business secretary @entity78 attacked the remarks			1
he told @entity80 : ' these bizarre remarks from universities minister @entity0 show just how out of touch @entity4 ministers are on the huge costs and debts now facing students			2
' they demonstrate a deeply dismissive attitude towards the real concerns which students and parents have on the cost of a degree			0
' the @entity4 - led government trebled fees , cut funding for universities and saddled both students and the taxpayer with a mountain of debt , and we have recently learned that the average student debt now stands at £ 43,500 – more than double what it was under the old system			0
' mr @entity0 ( second right ) , speaking at the @entity52 , said graduates earning £ 30,000 a year have to pay back £ 2.22 a day - the price of a coffee @entity110 coffees can cost more than £ 3 each at @entity113 , just over the river from the @entity30 , a posh coffee costs considerably more than £ 2.22			1
a ‘ grande ’ – or medium – @entity116 will set coffee lovers back £ 3.40			0
this works out at £ 1,241 a year			0
over 30 years , which is the amount of time graduates are expected to repay their student loans , a daily @entity123 hit will cost £ 37,230			2
but this is still below the average £ 43,500 debt currently being racked up by students			0
mr @entity78 said a new graduate tax system would be ' fairer ' than tuition fees and would be introduced ' in the medium term ' if @entity13 returns to power			1
the @entity131 proposed an extra tax of between 0.3 per cent and 2.5 per cent of their income above £ 15,000 , for a period of 20 years , with the highest earners paying higher rates			0
@entity13 is struggling to work out how to pay for a pledge it has already made to slash university tuition fees to £ 6,000 a year			1
previously , @entity13 has suggested that it might pay for the cut with a corporation tax increase on banks or with higher rates of interest for better - off students			0
the party may also be forced to restrict the cut in fees to certain types of courses such as technical degrees , leaving other students to keep on paying the current cost			0
mr @entity78 , who is responsible for higher education policy , said introducing a full - scale graduate tax ' as soon as possible is my priority '			1
but @entity13 's plan to cut tuition fees to £ 6,000 a year has been criticised by university bosses , who claim it will inflict ' colossal damage ' on the higher education sector			1
academics said the move could leave universities £ 10billion out of pocket and said it was ' implausible ' that the government could step in to make up the difference given the state of the public finances			0
in a letter to the @entity176 , a group of university vice chancellors accused @entity13 of failing to understand that cutting fees will only benefit richer graduates – because under the present system , people only start paying back their loans once they earn more than £ 21,000 a year			1
student debts are also written off after 30 years			0
the vice-chancellors said mr @entity185 's plans to lower tuition fees by £ 3,000 would leave £ 2billion a year out of pocket			2
@entity13 's shadow business secretary @entity78 attacked mr @entity0 's ' bizarre ' remarks shadow chancellor @entity189 has been asked to find the money to fund @entity185 's pledge to cut tuition fees to £ 6,000 a year they fear future @entity13 governments would be unable to find an extra £ 2 billion a year in the present financial climate			1
sir @entity196 , vice-chancellor of the @entity197 , said : ' this is purely a pragmatic issue , that a policy is evolving on the hoof which is not really a practical policy going forward and the potential damage is colossal : ' i really feel @entity13 has missed the point here			0
if you talk to students and to many mums and dads , the £ 9,000 [ fee ] is no longer the key topic			0
' @entity212 , president of @entity213 , added : ' what our students tell us is that clearly the debts incurred through fees is important , but what would be a real game - changer for students , or what can defeat students , is the debt that arises from living expenses while they are at university			0
' if money were to be spent to support the most needy students to go to university , subsidising fees is not the way to do it			0
' but @entity13 's shadow chancellor @entity189 claimed the current system of university financing would leave a ' huge looming charge ' for taxpayers as many graduates fail to pay back the cost of their tuition .			1

*exclusive* : minister @entity0 said graduates only pay back £ 2.22 a day
he said the cost of student loans made them a ' phenomenal investment '
@entity13 's @entity78 said the remarks showed he was ' out of touch '
mr @entity78 wants to reduce fees to £ 6,000 a year after the *election*
but the party eventually wants to replace student fees with a graduate tax
