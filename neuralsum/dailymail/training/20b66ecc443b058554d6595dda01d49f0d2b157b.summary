by @entity0 chemists in @entity2 have unveiling a groundbreaking new instant test for the most popular date rape drug			1
the flourescent sensor can change the colour of drinks within second to warn people drugs have been added			2
it can detect @entity12 ( @entity13 ) , or ' liquid ecstasy ' , which can can make anyone fall into a deep sleep			1
the simple test for date rape drugs : @entity19 , the fluorescent sensor for detecting date rape drug @entity13 ( bottle in top left ) , under uv light with the drug @entity13 ( bottle in top right ) , and when it was mixed into red wine without @entity13 ( vial in front left ) and with @entity13 ( vial in front right ) @entity13 was used as a central nervous system depressant to treat sleep disorders , promote fat reduction and muscle development , until it was banned for sale as a supplement in the @entity39 by the @entity40			1
it is odourless and colourless , and can go undetected in anyone 's glass			0
a small amount of the drug -- two to four grammes -- can make anyone fall into a deep sleep			0
current tests for @entity13 are difficult to carry out , the researchers say			1
professor @entity50 , from the @entity51 at @entity52 , said : ' the current method in the market is using ( a ) kind of paper ( a tissue - like piece of paper ) and ... run the paper chromatography separations			0
' the problem is , to run those samples -- the paper chromatography -- it takes about 10 minutes of your time			0
' ' currently , we are using the test tube kind of approach â€¦ but who would want to bring this ( a test tube ) to the discotheque ? " ' scientists from the @entity52 ( @entity52 ) have now found a way for @entity13 to show itself instantaneously - by changing the colour of the drink			1
when the sensor is mixed with a sample of a beverage containing @entity13 , the mixture changes colour in less than 30 seconds , making detection of the drug fast and easy			1
the team shortlisted 17 fluorescent compounds and further tested them with a wide range of different ghb concentrations			0
through this , the team identified that an orange fluorescent compound , coined @entity19 , changes colour when it is mixed with @entity13			2
in order to examine the efficiency of @entity19 , the team tested its detection capability by mixing a small amount of it with samples of various beverages , ranging from alcoholic , non-alcoholic , coloured and colourless drinks , which contain @entity13			0
drinks spiked with @entity13 are almost impossible to detect - but a new test claims to be able to make drinks change colour if it has been added the test revealed differences in the fluorescence intensity between @entity13 - free and ghb - spiked beverages			1
for drinks that are translucent or of a light colour , such as water or vodka , the change in colour can be easily detected with the naked eye			0
the change in the colour of darker drinks , such as @entity119 and whiskey , requires the aid of additional lighting to better detect the change			2
the team now hope to develop a simple kit they can commercialise using the technology .			0

@entity2 researchers say test can cause a drink to change colour in seconds
can detect @entity13 , also known as liquid ecstasy
set to be developed in an easy to use test
