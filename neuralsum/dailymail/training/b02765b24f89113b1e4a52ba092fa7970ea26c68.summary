by @entity0 published : 15:09 est , 24 february 2013 updated : 17:53 est , 24 february 2013 actor @entity1 has sparked a sexism controversy today after he tweaked the iconic command to signal the start of @entity5 in his role as @entity7			1
instead of ' gentlemen , start your engines , ' often described as the most famous words in sport , the 34 - year - old @entity9 star said ' drivers ... and @entity15 ... start your engines ! ' changing his command to accommodate @entity18 , the first woman to start from the pole in a @entity21 race , @entity1 nevertheless caused @entity22 to light up in indignation over his perceived insensitivity			1
scroll down for @entity25 @entity1 used an unfortunate choice of words to signal the start of the @entity5 today in @entity28 in his role as @entity7 as unpredictable as ever , he passed on a chance to copy the instruction that was used when @entity33 raced in the @entity34 , ' @entity29 and gentlemen , start your engines			1
' his critics pointed out that the published author and poet should have seen the distinction he was creating by making an exception of @entity15			1
his command as @entity7 can easily be interpreted as implying that @entity15 was not a ' driver ' like the men who made up the rest of the field			2
@entity47 's motor racing reporter @entity46 was especially critical of @entity1 's perceived mistake , tweeting , ' that command did n't exactly dovetail with @entity18 's long - stated worldview of being a driver / racer first and a woman second			1
' and photographer @entity54 simply stated on the social networking website , ' ok , the grand marshal is dumb			0
this is first race ? ' blogger @entity57 remakred that , ' i know @entity1 did n't mean it , but he definitely butchered the most famous words in # @entity62 with that @entity18 comment			1
' and viewer @entity64 was the most cutting , tweeting to her followers , ' @entity67			0
how 's that foot taste in your mouth ? ' the @entity72 - nominated actor was in town to promote his new film , ' @entity75 ' and noted in his pre-race press conference that ' @entity15 had done something special here , so i might have to switch it up			1
' prompting unfortunate memories of his awkward co-hosting of the 2011 @entity72 alongside @entity84 , @entity1 's gaffe at the race start indicated that perhaps the actor needed a few more rehearsals			1
@entity18 waves to fans as she walks down pit road before the start of the @entity62 @entity5 @entity21 auto race at @entity94 today this @entity5 viewer took instant exception to @entity1 's botched signal to start the race and following a thrilling race , @entity99 won his second @entity5 , racing past defending @entity62 champion @entity101 on the final restart , while @entity18 finished eighth			1
@entity99 was n't challenged over the final six laps sunday , adding another 500 title to go with his 2006 victory			2
this time crew chief @entity106 can enjoy it â€“ he was suspended by @entity62 for the first victory			0
@entity109 made a late move to finish second , but did n't challenge his @entity112 teammate for the victory			0
@entity33 was third on the final lap , but faded in the flurry of late action			1
she became the first woman in history to lead laps in the @entity5 , though , with her three laps out front			2
before the race all eyes were on @entity33 - only the third woman to compete in what is known as ' the @entity5			1
@entity33 started the @entity5 from pole position and no one doubts she deserves all the attention she is receiving or her credentials to compete with the very best			2
@entity33 , who ran a partial @entity21 program last year , showed she was ready to race full - time in @entity133 stock car racing by qualifying with a top speed of 196.434 mph around @entity94 last sunday			2
her top speed was the fastest qualifying effort at @entity5 since 1990 and inevitably raised talk about her becoming the first woman to win the coveted prize			2
@entity143 a @entity142 based blogger made allowances for @entity1 but still took him to task driver : @entity18 , center , prepares to get in her car before the start of the @entity62 @entity5 @entity21 auto race today @entity18 ( 34 ) leads during the early laps of the @entity154 auto race at @entity94 @entity155 ( 24 ) and @entity18 ( 10 ) lead during early laps of the @entity62 @entity5 @entity21 auto race at @entity94 today drivers take the green flag to the start of the @entity5 @entity21 race where @entity18 set off on pole this afternoon @entity164 ( 21 ) , @entity165 ( 99 ) , @entity166 ( 38 ) , @entity167 ( 32 ) , @entity168 ( 34 ) and @entity169 ( 17 ) collide between @entity170 and @entity171 as @entity155 ( 24 ) and @entity172 ( 9 ) drive by this afternoon @entity62 driver @entity18 waits to get in her car during the @entity154 @entity175 race yesterday in @entity28 @entity155 , who will start alongside @entity33 on the pole , summed up the feeling after qualifying : " it 's great to be a part of history with @entity15 being on the pole			1
i think we all know how popular she is , what this will do for our sport			0
" @entity33 , who has astutely marketed herself throughout her career in indycar racing and then @entity62 with some lucrative and high - profile endorsement deals , including regular appearances in @entity193 commercials , is not talking down her chances			0
actor @entity1 talks to the media before the start of the @entity21 @entity5 race where he explained he would make special reference to @entity18 's participation in the race the spectacular crash involving the car of @entity202 ( 32 ) takes place on the last lap @entity205 300 yesterday which injured almost 30 people @entity202 , driver of the # 32 @entity208 , and @entity209 , driver of the # 7 @entity210 spectacularly peel away after yesterday 's collision ' when pressure 's on , when the spotlight is on , i do feel like it ultimately ends up becoming some of my better moments , better races , better results , ' she said earlier this week			1
' i 'm grateful for it because the opposite of that would be i 'm guessing i probably would n't be here today , and i would n't be in the position i 'm in			0
' i 've been lucky enough to make history , be the first woman to do many things			0
i really just hope that i do n't stop doing that			0
we have a lot more history to make			0
' also causing controversy and getting himself into awkward situations at the race track today was rapper 50 cent			0

50 tried to accompany @entity237 as she walked pit road , but she was having none of it and turned her cheek when he leaned in for a kiss			0
earlier , 50 had surely raised the blood pressure of @entity62 officials when he arrived at @entity5 and tweeted , ' damn i do n't see no black people lol			0
