according to @entity1 's lawyer @entity17 , the offer of immunity had been rescinded at some point since @entity20 first made the agreement last march			1
prosecutors took back the offer allegedly after discovering that @entity20 had not been untruthful and uncooperative			2
' it 's unfortunate the government came in and made allegations without basis			2
people had to live with those allegations , ' @entity17 told @entity30			0
' mr. @entity1 's position was that he was immune not just from being convicted of a crime , but charged with a crime			1
' after the offer was taken away , @entity1 remained a person of interest in the case			2
an immunity hearing was scheduled for december , but had to be moved			0

at the time of @entity49 's disappearance , her brother told police he saw a man dressed in camouflage leading her into the woods near her home in @entity61 , located about 110 miles east of @entity62			1
last september , more than three years later , authorities said two men searching for ginseng found @entity49 's skull in a wooded area not far away			1

' i do not understand what is happening , ' @entity101 said			0
' i have never before been involved in a case where there is no information about why my client was charged			0
' in the motion to dismiss , @entity101 and @entity111 , @entity5 's lawyer , asked the judge to force prosecutors to produce ' all dental record analysis and forensic studies ' performed on the skull			2
not a care in the world : @entity120 ( center ) also charged in @entity49 's murder but defense attorneys for both him and fellow accused killer @entity5 say the prosecution has produced zero evidence of their guilt @entity6 has been in jail since march and @entity5 has been in jail since april			1

@entity147 took office sept. 1 after defeating district attorney @entity152 , who had indicted @entity6 and @entity5			1
the dispute was only resolved after @entity147 stepped down from the case and @entity154 , a @entity155 attorney who was @entity147 's co-counsel on the case and who had worked with death - penalty cases , was appointed as a special prosecutor			2
