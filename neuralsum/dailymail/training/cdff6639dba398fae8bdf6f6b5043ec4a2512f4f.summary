one man was later jailed for punching a police horse			2
@entity0 , though , senses an effort to make the fixture about the passion on the pitch rather than vitriol in the stands			2
‘ i am hearing the right stuff on the radio and in the street about the levels of antagonism between the two clubs dying down a little bit to what it 's really about – a football match			0
i am really pleased about that and hope it carries through to sunday , ’ he said			0
‘ i said two years ago that this nasty hate – those kinds of words – needed to go out			0
it ’s a rivalry , a game of football , may the best team win and then we shake hands and go home			0

but , at the same time , we know it 's a massive rivalry and the passion of the game should n't be lost			0
’ there has been suggestion that @entity3 fans could applaud during the 33rd minute of the match in a show of thanks for the money raised for charity by the @entity90 fund			1
and @entity0 added : ‘ the incident with the @entity93 flight has definitely helped build bridges and we need to carry on doing that			1
