unbeknownst to @entity86 , both meetings were recorded on a hidden camera			0
@entity95 : @entity2 's co-worker tipped off police about the woman 's deadly plot and helped set up a meeting between her and an undercover officer posing as a prospective hit man in april in cold blood : the young married mother could be seen smiling broadly and laughing while discussing how and when her husband would be killed scheduling : at one point , @entity2 pulled out her smartphone to choose the perfect day on the calendar for her husband 's murder detail - oriented : @entity2 could be seen ticking off on her fingers the items she has to bring for her next meeting with the hit man the following day in the videos , the mother - of - two could be seen grinning while discussing the details of the hit on her 27 - year - old husband in a detached , matter - of - fact way			1

' you know , i did n’t have to worry about the judgment of my family , i did n’t have to worry about breaking his heart , all that stuff like this			0
it ’s , like , how i got a clean getaway			0
' during the two meetings , the woman calmly tells the hit man that the best time to kill her husband would be on a thursday			1
at one point , she could be seen checking the calendar on her smartphone covered with a @entity146 sticker for the optimal date for the assassination			0
getting down to details , @entity2 explains that she is reluctant to stage the murder as a burglary gone awry because she is worried that it would scare off her friend , whom she wanted to move in with her after her husband 's death			1
during the second meeting on april 10 , @entity86 , sporting a @entity146 sweatshirt and a pair of pink sweatpants , stresses several times that she does not want her spouse to suffer , and that she wants him to die as painlessly as possible			0
she even suggests to the would - be assassin that the best method would be to break her husband 's neck , but the undercover detective tells @entity2 that he would prefer to use either a gun or a knife			1
in response , the 21 - year - old chooses the gun and calmly says ‘ ok ’ when the detective tells her that he will shoot her spouse in the face			0
final preparations : @entity2 turned up for the second meeting with hand - written notes outlining their floor plan and the directions to their home blood money : the 21 - year - old was asked to pay the assassin $ 100 as a down payment on the $ 50,000 contract moment of doubt : during her second meeting with the ' killer , ' @entity2 appears to have second thoughts about the plot ( left ) , but she quickly goes back on track with the plan to have her husband shot in the head @entity2 says that she does n’t want to know exactly when or how the murder would happen and that ‘ it would better if you surprised me			1
’ ‘ the more shocked i am when it happens , the better , ’ she tells the hit man			2
‘ i just want to make it as non-suspicious as possible			0
’ in their first conversation , the young mother tells the hit man that she would prefer the deed to be done outside their @entity208 home , explaining with a laugh that a shooting indoors ' would be messy in the house			1
' when @entity2 meets up with the detective the following day , carrying a floor plan of their home and directions to the house drawn on lined notebooks sheets , as well as her husband ’s ' photo , the two decide that the best option is to have mr @entity15 killed inside the apartment while she is at work			2
to make it look like a home invasion gone wrong , the killer will steal items such as a computer			0
@entity2 also could be seen handing the detective $ 100 as a down payment to prove to him that she is serious about the hit			1
at no point during her two encounters with the fake assassin does the 21 - year - old wife complain about her husband or cite a specific reason for her decision to have him killed beyond her desire to collect his life insurance			1

' a few minutes later , she adds , as if thinking out loud , ' it 's a bad idea for me			0
' but not before long , ms @entity2 appears to be back on track with her deadly plot after the undercover cop stresses that after today , she wo n't be able to call off the hit even if she has a change of heart at some point before the date chosen for the killing			2
merfled then asks the bogus killer : ' what happens if you get caught ? ' in response , the man reassures her that he will ' take the hit ' and keep her name out of the investigation so long as she pays him or his associates ‘ on the outside ’ the agreed upon sum of $ 50,000			1
the second meeting concludes with the hit man and his client shaking hands and him wishing @entity86 luck			1
