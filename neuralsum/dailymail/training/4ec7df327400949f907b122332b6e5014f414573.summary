@entity0 has been ordered to face a @entity2 federal lawsuit claiming it failed to tell consumers that its @entity4 would block them from receiving text messages if they switched to @entity8 - based smartphones			1
once @entity4 is enabled , @entity0 routes messages from other iphones through it			2
however , this can continue even when a number is switched to an @entity8 phone , without access to the service , meaning if anyone sends an @entity4 to that number it does n't get converted to a text , and ultimately ends up lost in the ether			1
when a person registers an @entity25 , their number is typically linked to @entity4			1
when they then swap to a new device , these messages are not always converted to text , and become lost			2
the tool ( pictured ) lets previous @entity25 owners enter their phone number to deregister it from the service if you still have the @entity25 you were using before you switched , transfer your sim card temporarily back into the @entity35 device			1
make sure the phone is connected to a network			0
click settings , messages and turn @entity4 off			0
if you no longer have the @entity25 , open @entity0 's new tool			1
select the correct country from the drop - down menu and type in the number			0
click ' send code '			0
enter the six - digit code that is sent to that number into the box below , and select @entity48			0
@entity2 district judge @entity49 in @entity50 , @entity51 said @entity0 must face plaintiff @entity53 's claim that the message blocking interfered with her contract with @entity56 for wireless service , which she kept after switching in april to a @entity58 from an @entity25			1
@entity53 , who seeks class - action status and unspecified damages , claimed that @entity0 failed to disclose how its @entity62 software operating system would obstruct the delivery of ' countless ' messages from other @entity0 device users if @entity25 users switched to @entity68 devices			1
in a monday night decision , @entity69 said @entity53 deserved a chance to show @entity0 disrupted her wireless service contract and violated a @entity51 unfair competition law , by blocking messages meant for her			2
' @entity76 does not have to allege an absolute right to receive every text message in order to allege that @entity0 's intentional acts have caused an actual breach or disruption of the contractual relationship , ' @entity69 wrote			1
the judge also dismissed some claims tied to another @entity51 consumer protection law			0
@entity0 did not immediately respond on tuesday to requests for comment			0
@entity89 , a lawyer for @entity53 , did not immediately respond to similar requests			0
in court papers , @entity0 said it never claimed that its @entity93 service and @entity95 application , which ran with @entity62 , would recognize when @entity25 users switched to rival devices			2
' @entity0 takes customer satisfaction extremely seriously , but the law does not provide a remedy when , as here , technology simply does not function as plaintiff subjectively believes it should , ' the @entity98 , @entity51 - based company said			0
earlier this week @entity0 released a tool that will help people deregister their number from @entity4 , or disable the service , to stop this from happening			1
the tool , first spotted by a @entity112 user , lets current or previous @entity25 owners enter their phone number to deregister it from @entity4			1
they are then sent a six - digit code to confirm they want to remove it			0
alternatively , people who still own an @entity25 and are selling it , or want to simply switch the service off , can click @entity120 , messages and @entity4 off			1
when purchasing an @entity25 , a number is typically linked to the firm 's @entity93 service upon registration			1
when a message is sent between enabled @entity35 devices , @entity0 sends it as an @entity4 - rather than as a text			2
imessages are sent using a web connection , rather than a network connection			0
but , when a person switches their number to a new phone , such as an @entity8 , that particular number can remain linked to @entity4			1
when an @entity62 user then sends that mobile number a message , @entity0 can end up routing it through its web service			2
but without access to @entity144 , the recipient does n't receive it unless the sender resends it as a text			0
previously , the only solution was to deregister the old device completely from their @entity0 accounts			2
the bug can also affect @entity152 that have a @entity154 connection and use a number			0
in may , @entity0 said it was addressing bugs within its @entity158 system that caused text messages to become lost when the recipient switched to a @entity68 phone			1
alternatively , people who still own an @entity25 and are selling it , or want to simply switch the service off , can click @entity120 , messages and @entity4 off			1
imessages are sent using a web connection , rather than a network connection			0
but , when a person switches their number to a new phone that number can remain linked but one disgruntled customer was so annoyed about missing messages , she filed a lawsuit against the firm			1
@entity53 claimed the company failed to disclose its knowledge of the problem			0
the issue does not appear to affect all previous @entity25 users , but @entity0 issued a statement that it had ' fixed a server - side @entity93 bug which was causing an issue for some users , ' and was working on an additional fix for future software updates			2
this latest tool offers such a fix .			0

when a person registers an @entity25 , their number is linked to @entity4
this means that when someone messages from another @entity25 , they receive it as an @entity4 rather than a text
if a person switches their number to a @entity68 phone , it can remain linked
@entity8 phones are not the only phones affected - any @entity68 device could be losing messages if a switch has been made from @entity0
and if they no longer have access to @entity4 , they may not receive posts
@entity0 's tool helps people deregister their number from @entity4
it also shows existing @entity25 owners how to disable the service
