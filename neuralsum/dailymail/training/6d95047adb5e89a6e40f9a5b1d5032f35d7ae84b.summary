by @entity0 , @entity2 correspondent and @entity3 , @entity4 political editor energy suppliers were accused of ‘ naked greed ’ last night and told they must explain why falling gas and electricity prices are not being passed on to consumers			1
in a public rebuke to the ‘ @entity15 ’ power suppliers , industry regulator @entity12 said they needed to win back the trust of the public			1
it said customers should be told why bills have not come down when the price suppliers pay has fallen ‘ significantly ’ after one of the mildest winters on record			2
failure to come up with an answer would be seen as a sign that the energy market is not competitive , it suggested			2
the price energy companies pay for gas on the wholesale market has fallen from around 70p per therm in december to just 37.55p yesterday @entity12 ’s intervention triggered fresh allegations that power firms are profiteering by raising bills as soon as costs go up , but taking their time to cut them when costs go down			1
@entity38 , whose leader @entity39 has promised to freeze energy bills if he wins the general election , leapt on @entity12 ’s comments , saying power firms were ‘ up to their old tricks ’			1
the @entity47 also accused the six – @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54 – of ‘ naked greed ’ and ‘ taking their customers for a ride ’			0
figures from @entity12 show that the price of buying gas for delivery the next day is 38 per cent lower than this time last year			1
even the longer - term gas contracts typically used by large energy suppliers are 16 per cent below last year			1
for electricity , short - term prices are 23 per cent lower than last year , while longer - term contracts are 9 per cent lower			2
labour leader @entity39 has promised to freeze bills for 20 months if he wins the next election factories and major users of energy will be paid to cut their power use under a plan to keep the lights on			1
@entity77 has announced measures to deal with the potential energy crunch over the next two winters			2
payments will be made to large energy users which can reduce their power use - for example by switching to back - up generation - during peak evening hours in winter			1
the scheme will be voluntary , and will ultimately help to save consumers ' money by preventing the need to build additional power plants to meet peak demand , @entity77 said			0
the operator also announced measures to secure reserves from power stations which would otherwise be closed or mothballed			0
@entity95 , leading this initiative on behalf of @entity77 , said : ' it 's our job as electricity system operator to make sure we 've got all the right tools at our disposal to balance supply and demand on the electricity network , 24 hours a day , 365 days a year			2
' but the average dual fuel bill has risen by £ 53 since last year to reach £ 1,265 , according to energy comparison website @entity107			1
fellow comparison site energyhelpline.com said its research showed that power firms could slash £ 77 off the average bill if they wanted to , thanks to wholesale price falls			2
but power firms said allegations that they were squeezing consumers for the sake of profit were wide of the mark			0
‘ we buy our gas well in advance , so movements in wholesale prices , up or down , do not feed through immediately to retail prices , ’ said @entity120 , residential energy boss at @entity49			1
‘ we are certainly not increasing profits on the back of lower wholesale gas prices – our trading statement last month downgraded profit expectations			1
’ industry body @entity132 said : ‘ all energy suppliers aim to hold costs as low as possible for as long as possible			0
’ @entity12 chief executive @entity135 said : ‘ in a competitive market the threat of losing market share would encourage suppliers to reduce their customers ’ bills whenever there are sustained reductions in costs			1
’ he said energy firms ‘ need to take the initiative and explain clearly what impact falling wholesale energy costs will have on their pricing policies ’			1
energy secretary @entity150 said energy suppliers should ‘ think very carefully and ensure that they pass savings as quickly as possible to their customers ’			2
but @entity38 shadow energy minister @entity154 said : ‘ yet again it looks like energy companies are up to their old tricks while @entity157 does nothing to stop them			0
