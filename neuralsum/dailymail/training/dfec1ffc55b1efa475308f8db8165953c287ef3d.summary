nurses shouted at relatives who tried to give their dying loves ones a sip of water , an inquiry into the controversial @entity1 revealed today			1
ministers moved to scrap the end of life plan after a damning inquiry found it was being used as an excuse for poor care			1
dying patients were placed on the @entity1 without their families knowing , left for weeks and in some cases months , and denied water despite the pleading of loved ones to let them have a drink			1
write caption here the shocking catalogue of abuse found that some relatives were forced to give their loved ones water secretly when the nurse was out of the room – because medical staff had forbidden it			0
@entity29 , who carried out the review , said that hydration problems were the ‘ biggest issue ’ raised by people who gave evidence to the review			1
she added : ‘ the same stories keep emerging of poor care , appalling communications and oft a lack of attention or compassion			2
' among the worst stories were of people on the @entity1 for days going into weeks without communication or review or discussion			1
‘ and also desperate stories of desperate people who are longing for a drink of water who were , through misunderstanding of the @entity1 and poor care , denied a drink			1
‘ stories of nurses shouting at families who give a patient a drink were frequent as were stories of people who were just left to get on with it with no regular observations or review			2
’ hundreds of thousands of people have been put on the @entity1 since it was developed in the late 1990s			2
developed by the @entity67 and the @entity68 in @entity1 to care for terminally ill cancer patients , it was later expanded to help anyone who was dying			1
it was supposed to alert clinicians to not just a dying patient ’s physical problems but their emotional , social and spiritual needs in their final hours and days			0
but it has faced a storm of criticism , with relatives not told that loved ones had been placed on the @entity1 , and the guidance misinterpreted by some hospitals so that patients were even denied water			1
in november last year ministers ordered an independent review into its use after it was revealed up to 60,000 patients die on the @entity1 each year without giving their consent			1
a third of families are also kept in the dark when doctors withdraw lifesaving treatment from loved ones			1
the pathway involves withdrawal of lifesaving treatment , with the sick sedated and usually denied nutrition and fluids			2
death typically takes place within 29 hours			0
records from 178 hospitals also show that thousands of people on the pathway are left to die in pain because nurses do not do enough to keep them comfortable while drugs are administered			0
concerns have been raised that clinical judgments are being skewed by incentives for hospitals to use the pathway			0
health trusts are thought to have been rewarded with an extra £ 30million for putting more patients on the @entity1			2
now the government is to phase out the @entity1 and scrap the incentive payments to encourage trusts to end patients ' lives			1
the @entity1 - which recommends that in some circumstances doctors withdraw treatment , food and water from sedated patients in their final days - has come under intense scrutiny			1
reports have suggested that doctors have been establishing ‘ death lists ’ of patients to be put on the pathway but some hospitals have been accused of using it to cut costs and save bed spaces			2
the review recommended scrapping the @entity1 after finding doctors used it ‘ as an excuse for poor - quality care ’			1
they concluded that there were ‘ too many cases where the @entity1 was simply being used as a ' tick box ' exercise			2
’ health minister @entity142 announced that the @entity1 would be phased out over the next 6 - 12 months after learning of ' too many examples of poor practice and poor quality care , with families and carers not being properly involved and supported '			1
in a statement to mps he added : ' instead , an individual approach to end of life care for each patient will be introduced , with a personalised care plan backed up by condition - specific good practice guidance and a named senior clinician responsible for its implementation			1
' people who use health and care services have the right to be treated with respect , dignity and compassion by staff with the skills and time to care for them properly			0
' we all want our own and our loved ones ’ final days and hours to be pain - free and dignified , with individual needs prioritised and respected , and with families and carers fully involved			1
' the review found examples of patients being so heavily drugged that they could ‘ never communicate again ’ , meaning their grief - stricken families never got to say goodbye			1
and some claimed their relatives had been given a ‘ chemical cosh ’ cocktail of drugs , with the express intent of hastening their deaths from dehydration			0
every year , 130,000 patients have been placed on the pathway , which usually involves heavy sedation with morphine or similar drugs			2
the @entity188 has been leading a campaign against it , highlighting examples of doctors putting patients on the pathway without asking for consent			0
we also revealed how some hospitals were being paid six - figure ‘ bribes ’ to meet targets about the numbers of patients on the @entity1 – leading to fears that doctors were put under pressure to use the pathway			1
following our revelations , mr @entity142 asked @entity29 to carry out a review into the controversial pathway – in the face of opposition from the medical establishment			1
the report , more care – @entity213 , says that although the @entity1 was working well in many places , there were too many examples of abuse for it to continue			1
it will be replaced with more individualised care packages , and all incentive payments to hospitals will be scrapped			0
under the pathway , nurses use wet sponges to moisten the mouths of dying patients after food and drink is withdrawn			0
the fact that some patients were seen sucking on the sponges indicates that they were very uncomfortable and were desperate for water – and perhaps not as close to inevitable death as thought			0
treatment : nurses banned family members from giving loved ones water during their final hours , the review found it raises uncomfortable memories of @entity241 hospital , where a patient on an understaffed @entity243 was so dehydrated he was forced to drink from a vase			1
the report concludes that in too many cases , the @entity1 is used as a ‘ tick - box exercise ’ rather than looking at what the dying patients actually need			1
‘ where care is already poor , the pathway is sometimes used as a tick - box exercise , and good care for the dying patient or their relatives or cares may be absent , ’ the report says			1
‘ whether true or not , many families suspected that deaths had been hastened by over-prescription of strong painkilling drugs or sedatives			0
’ @entity29 spoke to dozens of people about the care their loved ones had received during their final hours			1
some reported ‘ disobeying instructions from medical staff to withhold fluids ’ – instead secretly giving them water when the nurse had left the room			0
the report says : ‘ some talked about their relatives sucking on the sponges that they had been given to wet the patient ’s mouth in an attempt to get fluid , when fluids had been deliberately withheld			0
’ it finds that in many cases , opiates were given in too strong a dose , making the patient ‘ too drowsy and confused to be able to communicate and ask for water ’			0
and it adds : ‘ there was a feeling that the drugs had been used as a “ chemical cosh ” that reduced people ’s desire to accept food or drink			0
‘ there have been too many coming forward to the review panel to say they left their loved one in a calm and peaceful state , able to communicate , for a short time , or with a doctor or a nurse for a check - up only to return and find a syringe driver had been put in place and their loved one was never able to communicate again			1
‘ one family was left with the impression that their relative had been overmedicated so that he would die from dehydration			0
’ the @entity188 has led the way in exposing shocking cases of abuse of vulnerable people on the @entity1			2
here are some of the chilling examples : @entity322 , 85 @entity323 died alone aged 85 after hospital staff failed to tell her family she was being put on the pathway @entity323 , 85 , died alone at @entity327 and @entity328 after doctors failed to tell relatives they were ending her life			2
staff reassured relatives on the phone just hours before her death in february 2011 that there was no urgent need to visit – even though doctors had already removed tubes providing vital food and fluids			0
her family discovered that she had died only when her niece , @entity342 , went to visit her and found she was already being prepared for the mortuary			0
@entity344 , 90 @entity345 died on the @entity1 at home after he was given sedatives the family of former soldier @entity345 said he was put on the pathway at his home without consulting them			2
the 90 - year - old , who lived near @entity354 in @entity355 , had cancer but insisted he was not ready to die until after his granddaughter ’s wedding			2
but his family said he died at home in october last year after he was given sedatives by a district nurse			0
the next day they were unable to wake him to give him food or drink and he fell into a diabetic coma			0
@entity369 , 48 @entity370 was ' rescued ' from the care pathway and lived for another five weeks @entity370 , 48 , was said to be severely brain damaged and close to death after a cardiac arrest			2
his family gathered at his bedside last june to say their goodbyes at @entity378 in @entity379 , @entity380 , after it withdrew fluids and said it was going to let him ‘ slip away ’			0
but when mr @entity370 ’s sister , who is a nurse , gently moved him to change his bloodstained sheets , he started to murmur words			0
every ten minutes relatives gave him drops of water before doctors eventually agreed to put him back on a drip			0
he was able to return home , lived for another month and was able to say farewell to his loved ones			0
his sisters called the @entity1 a ‘ licence to kill ’ .			0

ministers order @entity1 to be *ditched* within a year ,
review by @entity29 reveals how end - of - life treatment was used as an excuse for appalling levels of care
families were not told their loved ones were on the ' pathway ' to death
