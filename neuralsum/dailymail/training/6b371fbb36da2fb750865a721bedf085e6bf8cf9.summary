at the end of a contest that produced the expected result , there was an unexpected moment , a hug between @entity6 and @entity7			1
if the two men have decided to get along after a few years of discord then its perhaps as well			2
they will be seeing quite a bit of each other over the coming years			2
before this season started , most people had @entity14 and @entity15 as the two teams most likely to win the @entity17			1
perhaps we should go further now			2
after only a month of the new season , they look the only teams capable of winning it			2
rival managers @entity6 and @entity7 embrace after the 1 - 1 draw at the @entity24 on sunday speaking on tv at full - time yesterday , former @entity26 midfielder @entity25 said eloquently : ‘ these two are head and shoulders above everybody else			1
they do n’t have weaknesses			2
’ on a weekend that saw @entity26 fail at @entity35 and @entity36 embarrass themselves at @entity37 , this was proper football			1
there was resilience , organisation and devastating quality			0
there were goals from substitutes and contributions from players operating in unfamiliar positions			0
there was an absence of panic from @entity14 when they fell a man , and then a goal , behind			1
equally there was no complacency from @entity15 when they won a lead the general pattern of play had not pointed to			1
the @entity36 bench is stunned after falling to a catastrophic 5 - 3 defeat to @entity37 from 3 - 1 up @entity26 manager instructs captain @entity63 during their lacklustre 3 - 1 defeat to @entity35 had @entity67 not struck a post with the score at 1 - 0 , they would have had a win of significance			1
referee @entity72 almost ruined the afternoon			0
not by sending off @entity73 for a second booking , but by distributing so many yellow cards in the first half that a red one always seemed possible , if not inevitable , later on			0
a victory for @entity15 would have felt just a little hollow			1
until the sending off , they had been marginally second best in a contest that was notable at that point for some expert defending by both teams			0
@entity6 attempts to reason with @entity7 during the enthralling match between their sides at the @entity24 @entity90 , on debut for @entity14 , was magnificent alongside @entity91 in defence despite the late drama , the pairings of @entity91 and @entity90 and @entity94 and @entity95 were the stand - out features of this game			1
partnerships like those win titles , despite the millions of pounds invested in players at the other end of the field			0
happily , @entity14 were able to regain parity			1
happily because it left us talking about a fair result and a remarkable @entity108 story rather than the referee ’s influence			0
@entity14 ’s equaliser was interesting and told us much about their qualities			1
@entity114 had performed terrifically down the right side , providing evidence that @entity118 players can thrive at @entity14 if they are good enough			1
but it was from the position of left back that he advanced to provide @entity108 with the opportunity to equalise			0
running on to @entity124 ’s chipped pass , @entity114 was on the stretch but the touch he applied to the ball was perfect in weight and in direction			0
@entity130 celebrates scoring @entity15 's opener but rarely starts due to competition for places in the side @entity135 are increasingly important in the @entity17 , especially to those clubs with @entity138 commitments			1
squads win championships , as they say			2
@entity130 is a good one , too			0
the @entity141 showed this during the @entity143 in @entity144			0
here , he timed his far post run perfectly in the 71st minute , allowing him to make the most of a superb @entity149 cross that was enabled in the first place by a superb turn and pass from @entity67			0
this is what makes these teams so impressive , so effective			0
@entity67 , for example , had endured a difficult afternoon			0
in trying to impose himself physically on @entity14 captain @entity91 , he had failed			1
@entity108 arrives late in the box to score @entity14 's equaliser and deny @entity15 three points at the @entity24 in essence , he had lost one of the pivotal personal duals of the game			1
still , though , he was able to influence the outcome			0
both clubs have benefited from long - term planning and transfer strategy			2
as @entity36 are finding , big money deals pushed through at the last minute will only take you so far			2
@entity90 was immense on his debut on sunday , only slightly less effective than @entity91			2
@entity67 also emerged to play his part , too			0
@entity15 and @entity14 were fine teams last season but they have improved and whether anyone else can really get near them is very doubtful			1
in the press conference room , @entity6 and @entity7 reverted to type and started criticising each other			1
maybe that hug meant nothing at all			0
maybe it pointed at relief and satisfaction in equal measure			0
@entity108 shakes hand with his former @entity15 team mate @entity94 at the final whistle at the @entity24 @entity7 ad @entity6 shake hands but they were far from complimentary in the post match interviews			1

rivals @entity14 and @entity15 drew 1 - 1 in *pulsating* match on sunday
@entity6 and @entity7 have *assembled* fine squads
@entity26 fell to a *disappointing* 3 - 1 loss to @entity35 at @entity196
@entity36 *continue* to toil with 5 - 3 capitulation at @entity37
