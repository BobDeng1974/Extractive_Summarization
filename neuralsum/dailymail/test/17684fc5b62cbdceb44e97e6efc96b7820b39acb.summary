a @entity1 aerospace commander has sensationally claimed that some spy satellites are masquerading as space junk in @entity5 orbit			1
the official refused to comment on how many such satellites there were , and which countries were operating them			2
it suggests there could be more satellites than thought monitoring different countries on @entity5			0
the claim was made by the commander of @entity17			1
@entity18 said someone was hiding satellites as space junk ( artist 's illustration of a satellite shown )			1
but in a film he refused to name the country behind the ruse the claims were made by the commander of @entity17 , @entity18			1
he was speaking on a film called ‘ @entity35 ’ during a tour of @entity1 ’s main centre for aerospace intelligence in @entity33 , near @entity34			0
‘ very recently , specialists of the department of space intelligence centre uncovered a newly created group of space satellites ... made for radio - technical reconnaissance of equipment on @entity1 territory , ’ he said			2
a reconnaissance satellite is unofficially referred to as a spy satellite			0
they are @entity5 observation satellites or communications satellites traditionally used for military or intelligence purposes			0
some are used to simply take images from the ground , while others relay information from one place to another			0
many such satellites are used today for high - resolution photography of certain areas , for scientific or defense purposes			0
the film goes on to state that there ‘ are cases when a space satellite pretends to be space junk for years and then wakes up and starts working at the right moment			1
’ the comments were made yesterday on ‘ @entity67 ’ , when @entity1 commemorated the first human spaceflight - @entity68 , on 12 april 1961			1
since then hundreds of rockets have been launched into space – and @entity1 itself now has about 140 satellites operating in orbit			0
their @entity17 is a division of the military responsible for warning of missile and air strikes and controlling @entity1 's defence satellites			2
it monitors about 20,000 objects orbiting the planet , out of a total of 100,000 significant objects			0
some objects are believed to have a military purpose - but it ’s not quite clear what the purpose of the satellites disguised as space junk are			1
@entity92 has asked the @entity93 ( @entity93 ) and @entity17 for further information on the claim			2
