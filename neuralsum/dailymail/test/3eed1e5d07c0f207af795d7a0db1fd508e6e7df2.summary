@entity0 has released the first close - up views of the north pole of dwarf planet @entity3 from the @entity5			1
@entity5 arrived on 6 march , the first time a spacecraft has orbited a dwarf planet , and is now preparing for the key science phase of the mission			2
however , the images have not yet revealed what the mystery ‘ bright spots ’ on the surface of the world are , which have gripped the attention of scientists and the public alike			1
@entity0 scientists in @entity21 have released new images of @entity3 ( shown )			1
they were taken by the @entity5 from a distance of 21,000 miles ( 33,000km )			1
the spacecraft is beginning to move closer and closer to @entity3			1
and it will soon study the whole planet - including its mystery bright spots the latest images were taken on 10 april from a distance of 21,000 miles ( 33,000km ) , and are the highest - resolution views of @entity3 so far			1
the spacecraft is currently on the side of the planet that is mostly shrouded in darkness , but over the coming months it will see more of the world in light			0
and it will also see @entity3 in better and a higher resolution			0
@entity3 is 590 miles ( 950 km ) across and was discovered in 1801			2
it is the closest dwarf planet to the sun and is located in the asteroid belt , making it the only dwarf planet in the inner solar system			0
@entity3 is the smallest of the bodies currently classified as a ' dwarf planet '			2
it lies less than three times as far as @entity51 from the sun - close enough to feel the warmth of the star , allowing ice to melt and reform			0
@entity0 's @entity5 has been making its way to @entity3 from the asteroid @entity58 since september 2012			1
there is high interest in the mission because @entity3 because it is seen as being a record of the early solar system , and may also have shifting ice on its surface			0
@entity3 is the largest body in the main asteroid belt between @entity68 and @entity69 , with an average diameter of 590 miles ( 950km )			2
@entity5 has been using its ion propulsion system to rendezvous with the dwarf planet since leaving the giant asteroid @entity58 in 2012			2
its first ‘ science orbit ’ will begin on 23 april , with the spacecraft remaining a distance of 8,400 miles ( 13,500km ) away until 9 may			2
after this , it will begin making lower and lower orbits to get better views of the surface			0
the mission will allow scientists to study the last major body between @entity51 and @entity69 that has yet to be explored			0
' the mission is so exciting , because we 're exploring the last uncharted world of the solar system , ' dr @entity85 , @entity5 chief engineer and mission director at @entity87 told @entity92			0
' for me the opportunity to travel to this distant alien world that has been known of for two centuries , a mysterious world of rock and ice , perhaps with subsurface liquid water maybe stored as ponds , lakes or oceans , is very exciting			0
' shown above is an animation of @entity3 rotating as @entity5 observed its north pole			2
@entity3 is about 2.8 times further from the sun than @entity51 , and a day on the dwarf planet lasts nine @entity51 hours			0

its first ‘ science orbit ’ will begin on 23 april , with the spacecraft remaining a distance of 8,400 miles ( 13,500km ) away until 9 may in the next few weeks and months , the dwarf planet will be studied in great detail			2
but the most impressive images will be returned in december , when @entity5 starts one of its lowest science orbits			0
it will be at an altitude of just 225 miles ( 360km ) above the surface - below the orbital height of the @entity126 around @entity51 - allowing it to get high resolution images of the surface			0
the primary science mission for the spacecraft will last until june 2016 - by which the team expects to have achieved all of its scientific goals - and it is unlikely the spacecraft will be extended beyond that date , as it will probably start running out of fuel by then			0
this map - projected view of @entity3 was created from images taken by @entity0 's @entity5 during its initial approach to the dwarf planet , prior to being captured into orbit in march 2015			1
differences in morphology and color across the surface suggest @entity3 was once an active body perhaps of most interest , though , are the mystery bright spots on the surface			1
these are thought to possibly be expanses of ice inside a crater on @entity3			0
based on new infrared images released by @entity0 the other day , it appears that the pair of spots have different thermal properties - suggesting they have different origins			1
they could also be towering ‘ water volcanoes ’ , but more observations will be needed to confirm or deny this			0
' the bright spots continue to fascinate the science team , but we will have to wait until we get closer and are able to resolve them before we can determine their source , ' said @entity175 from the @entity176 , @entity177			1
these images , from @entity5 's visible and infrared mapping spectrometer ( @entity180 ) , highlight two regions on @entity3 containing bright spots			1
the images suggest they coudl be towering ‘ water volcanoes ’ , but more observations will be needed to confirm or deny this ' the bright spots [ seen in this previous @entity0 image ] continue to fascinate the science team , but we will have to wait until we get closer and are able to resolve them before we can determine their source , ' said @entity175 from the @entity176 , @entity177			1
