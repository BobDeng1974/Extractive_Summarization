@entity0 : @entity2 unit the @entity3 compiled information on the murdered teenager 's family a rogue undercover police unit ‘ hoovered up ’ a staggering amount of personal details during 40 years of secretive missions , a damning report revealed yesterday			1
members of the @entity3 ( @entity3 ) compiled information about at least 18 justice campaigns , many made up of relatives fighting for the truth after the deaths of victims from ethnic minorities			1
but much of the intelligence they gathered was no more than worthless ‘ community gossip ’			0
some @entity27 commissioners and their most senior colleagues were ‘ possibly negligent ’ in their lack of knowledge of the unit ’s existence , the report ’s author claimed			1
yesterday , the chief constable leading the unprecedented inquiry into undercover policing said some top officers would face misconduct proceedings if they were still serving			1
the undercover officers themselves could face prosecution over illicit sexual affairs they had with targets and their appearances in court under false identities			2
@entity46 , who is conducting the inquiry , known as @entity48 , criticised senior @entity2 officers as being complacent and ‘ possibly negligent ’ in their failure to oversee the activities of the @entity3			1
he said : ‘ we have spoken to officers who held the rank of commissioner and deputy commissioner along with other very senior officers involved in covert policing and public order and the vast majority of them knew nothing of the existence of @entity3			1
‘ this is astonishing given the suggested pivotal role the @entity3 played in reporting on violence and extremism and preventing disorder and the question has to be asked about the lack of executive scrutiny , of intrusive senior management and of effective supervision			1
’ the latest revelations about the controversial unit sparked fresh outrage about the activities of undercover officers			2
investigators discovered officers gathered information about the families of murdered black teenager @entity0 ; @entity82 , who was shot dead by police after being mistaken for a suicide bomber ; and mother - of - eight @entity86 , whose shooting sparked the @entity90 riots in 1985			2
some of those targeted said they will consider suing the @entity93 again and one mother said she felt ‘ stripped of my dignity ’			0
mr @entity46 said his staff spoke to three former commissioners and an unknown number of their deputies and assistants			0
he declined to name them , but lord @entity102 was in charge when mr @entity104 was shot dead by police at @entity106 in 2005			0
@entity107 and @entity108 occupied the commissioner ’s office when the unit was reporting back on private matters involving the @entity0 family			0
the report found @entity3 officers improperly gathered and stored information on at least 18 justice campaigns between 1970 and 2005			1
but mr @entity46 said no documentary evidence or witnesses have been found to substantiate claims that the @entity3 deliberately targeted grieving families			1
investigators found officers gathered information about the families of @entity86 , left , whose shooting sparked the @entity90 riots , and @entity82 , right , who was killed by police on the @entity129 in 2004 @entity48 was sparked by incendiary claims last year from @entity131 , a former undercover officer , in the @entity132 that a spy was ordered to smear the @entity0 family			2
but mr @entity131 repeatedly refused to be interviewed by @entity135 investigators , and mr @entity46 said : ‘ there is no witness or documentary evidence that supports those allegations			0
’ he said @entity3 officers were never directly tasked to infiltrate or inform on families , but were targeting violent factions who wanted to hijack their justice campaigns			1
mr @entity46 said worthless information of no value to criminal probes was stored , for example details of someone attending a funeral			0
the @entity152 chief said such information should have been destroyed , in line with modern laws governing secretive police operations and people ’s right to privacy			0
the undercover police saga is far from over , as prosecutors examine whether officers perverted the course of justice by using false identities in court			2
there may also be criminal charges arising from sexual relationships between officers and activists			0
mr @entity46 said his team has another 12 months of work as they scour archives of secret material			0
@entity93 assistant commissioner @entity175 said : ‘ i regret enormously the distress that has been caused to families			0

former senior officers deny knowledge of the @entity3
some could have faced misconduct proceedings if they were not retired
police *insist* spies targeted violent factions who wanted to hijack campaigns
