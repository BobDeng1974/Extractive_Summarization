before and after : @entity9 wore make up , left , to have his photograph taken , but was asked to remove it , right , before the @entity3 would take his license photo @entity24 says staff claimed that @entity3 rules stated that the photo needed to show the person as they appear normally , and banned pictures taken in ' disguise '			1
' this is who i am and my clothing and make - up reflect that , ' @entity24 said			1
