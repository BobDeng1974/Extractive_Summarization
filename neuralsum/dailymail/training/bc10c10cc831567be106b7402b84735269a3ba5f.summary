by @entity0 published : 07:57 est , 12 september 2013 updated : 10:37 est , 12 september 2013 rental mental : increasing numbers of young people in @entity4 are choosing not to buy their own properties an @entity7 's house may be his castle - but buying his own could be becoming as much a thing of the past as knights in shining armour			1
new figures reveal nearly half of young @entity15 are no longer interested in owning their homes - bucking a trend that is more akin to @entity20 and @entity21 renting culture			1
today 's figures come alongside news that house prices in parts of central @entity26 have rocketed by 116 per cent in the past eight years - with @entity28 homes outstripping this at a staggering 139 per cent increase in value			1
this outpaces the retail price index by 86 per cent , while the average @entity4 house price has dropped by 19.3 per cent in real terms over the same period			1
and while an overwhelming 93 per cent of @entity15 aged between 55 and 75 said they still saw owning their own property as the ' ultimate goal ' , just a third of under - 35s felt the same way			1
just over half of @entity15 aged 35 and under live in a home they do not own , according to the survey by financial protection specialist @entity46 =			1
. and found 42 per cent of them are simply not bothered about owning their own home - even though many said they could afford to			1
this changing outlook mirrors the culture in @entity21 and @entity20 , where long term renting is the norm			0
@entity21 has the greatest proportion of renters in @entity58 as 61 per cent choose to rent , rather than own their home			2
it is seen as a perfectly acceptable alternative brought about largely by the reluctance of banks to loan money for mortgages - and it ’s clear the @entity4 is now following suit			1
only half of the @entity20 live in their own properties - with 52 per cent renting - due to a boom in property prices in recent years			1
with @entity4 banks also tightening lending criteria , the notion of long term renting is gathering momentum here as well			2
and while the previous generation expected to own their first home by the age of 25 , those aged 20 to 35 said they ca n't see themselves putting down a deposit until they ’re at least 36			2
attitudes have changed too , with almost three quarters said the notion that it ’s shameful to never own a property is ‘ completely out of date ’			0
more than three quarters of tenants said the government 's ' help to buy ' scheme has not motivated them to put a foot onto the property ladder			0
and given the latest figures from @entity26 , it 's easy to see why even successful young city workers may be less enthusiastic about finding their own place			2
@entity101 is a 32 - year - old it worker from @entity102 , @entity103			1
he has been renting for nine years and has no intention of buying his own property			0
he said : ' i ’m happy to continue renting at the moment			0
it ’s such a big commitment to buy my own house			0
' it ’s so hard to get a mortgage from the bank these days and it ’s just easier at the moment to keep renting			0
' more than three quarters of tenants said the government 's ' help to buy ' scheme has not motivated them to put a foot onto the property ladder			0
and given the latest figures from @entity26 , it 's easy to see why even successful young city workers may be less enthusiastic about finding their own place			2
@entity26 - where prices have more than doubled since 2005 - is made up the affluent areas of @entity28 , @entity127 , @entity128 , @entity129 , @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity132 , @entity132			1
after @entity28 , the top performing area was @entity127 , where values are up 133 per cent compared with eight years ago			0
it was only in @entity132 and @entity132 that prices did n’t more than double over the eight - year period - although they still increased by 97 and 88 per cent respectively			1
and last week , figures from the @entity140 's monthly house price index showed a 5.4 per cent increase in the average value of a home , from £ 160,292 to £ 170,231 compared with the same period last year			1
figures from @entity145 released at the same time showed there had been a 45 per cent increase in the number of first - time buyers in july compared with the same month in 2012			2
but today 's figures show the number of renters has also risen - from 2.4 million in 2005 to 3.8 million in 2011 - 12			1
this 58 per cent increase comes despite the rising cost of rent			0
@entity26 living : @entity158 in @entity132 , which was recently declared the most expensive house in the capital at £ 105 million - 640 times the average house price the average renter in @entity132 and @entity129 is looking at a monthly cost of over £ 4,000 for a two - bedroom property - although in @entity166 in @entity167 , renters can expect to pay an average of around £ 830 a month			1
this was in comparison with the whole of the @entity167 , where the cost of renting - £ 1,152 per month - consumes almost half of the average person 's monthly salary , and £ 947 per month - 39 per cent of monthly income - in the rest of the country			2
in the survey of @entity15 , most of those who did not want to buy a house ( 17 per cent ) named not wanting to be tied down as their main reason for renting instead			1
after this came being unsure about the area ( 13 per cent ) and having no desire to buy ( 10 per cent ) are their main reasons			0
meanwhile , 7 per cent would rather spend their money on other things than putting it into property			0
the majority of 20 to 35 year old tenants - 72 per cent - said they were either married or in a relationship and earning an average of £ 34,084 a year			2
@entity198 , director of research at @entity200 , described the increase in prime central @entity26 against the rest of the country as ' unprecedented '			2
@entity26 7.2 % @entity203 5.9 % @entity204 4.5 % @entity205 4.2 % @entity206 3.9 % @entity167 3.3 % @entity207 2.6 % @entity208 2.3 % @entity209 and the @entity210 1.2 % @entity211 0.5 % @entity212 -3.6 % @entity4 5.2 % source : @entity214 / @entity200 he said : ' historically , the price of prime central @entity26 stock has risen substantially in the first half of a housing market cycle , before a period of catch up by the rest of the country			1
' however , in the last two complete housing cycles , the overall gap has widened			0
' this outperformance reflects the fact that prime central @entity26 is driven by different factors compared to the mainstream @entity4 market			1
' @entity4 mainstream residential has been largely dependent on the domestic economy , the supply of mortgage credit and the affordability constraints of @entity4 households			0
' in contrast , prime central @entity26 demand is driven by global wealth , attracted to a political and economic safe haven , which is culturally diverse but also has a strong investment track record			0
' these attributes have been heightened over the past eight years , during which time global wealth , particularly from emerging economies , has grown significantly			0
' @entity245 , @entity46 = head of protection , urged renters to take out insurance to guarantee repayments in case something happens to the mortgage payer			0
' if you are a tenant , it is still important to have a financial back up plan in place which would enable you to carry on living in your home if you were unable to work , ' he said .			0
