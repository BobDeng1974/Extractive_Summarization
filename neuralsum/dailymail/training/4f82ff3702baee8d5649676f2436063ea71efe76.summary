@entity1 's latest scorching demonstration of predatory try - scoring reignited his @entity4 prospects on sunday , but was n’t quite enough to propel @entity5 to a famous @entity7 victory			1
ultimately , @entity8 asserted their status as an established force in continental competition by fighting back from a 20 - 11 deficit in this @entity13 clash to record a 26th win in their last 30 home matches at this exalted level and avoid a first defeat at the @entity19 since 2009			1
yet , they were given an almighty scare by one of the @entity23 ’s rising clubs , as @entity5 surged in front courtesy of @entity1 ’s solo masterpiece			1
@entity8 's @entity26 ( centre ) , scorer of two tries , leaves the field after the victory @entity31 goes over in the second - half for @entity8 's second try of the match against @entity5 @entity8 : @entity35 ; @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity31 ; @entity39 , @entity40 ( @entity41 , 61 ) ; @entity42 , @entity43 ( @entity44 , 65 ) , @entity45 ( @entity46 , 65 ) ; @entity47 , @entity48 ( @entity49 , 47 ) ; @entity50 , @entity51 ( capt ) , @entity52			1

referee : @entity81 ( @entity82 )			0
nothing was on , or so it seemed , when the ball came to the diminutive 23 - year - old in the 34th minute			1
the visitors had a penalty advantage , so he just tried his luck and it paid off gloriously			0
@entity1 darted to his right and swerved past the flailing @entity35			2
that created the space , but he still had plenty to do			0
flicking on the turbo jets , he raced past @entity26 down the flank and , as @entity36 charged across to make a try - saving cover tackle , @entity1 leapt past him and kept his balance to touch down			1
it was a staggering exhibition of finishing class and a very timely one , too			0
@entity4 head coach @entity103 and his assistants are announcing their squad for the autumn internationals on wednesday and wing is an area of uncertainty			2
@entity1 is among a clutch of contenders jostling for a place next month and this wonderful strike will have done him no harm , although any reservations about the uncapped @entity116 have always focused on his defending rather than attacking			2
‘ @entity118 has struggled with his confidence this season and he has struggled to get into games , ’ said @entity117 , @entity5 ’ director of rugby			2
@entity31 celebrates in the pool two @entity123 clash in @entity125 ‘ but we all know he is capable of doing something special			2
he is always a threat and he has been getting better every game since he came back from injury			0
on the big stage , he can always do something like that and he also defended well today			0
’ while that will have come as good news for @entity137 and @entity4 as well as @entity5 , less welcome was the sight of @entity139 needing treatment near the end , after being tackled by @entity49 and @entity46			1
the lock played on to the end , but he will be assessed by his club ’s medical staff today			0
‘ @entity139 took a bit of a knock from the side on his knee , ’ said @entity117			0
‘ the physios will have a look at him			0
i do n’t expect it to be anything too serious , but we ’ll have a look at it tomorrow			0
’ @entity8 captain and @entity155 @entity51 applauds the supporters at the @entity19 before @entity1 ’s dramatic intervention , @entity5 had already seized the initiative in stirring fashion , despite @entity8 ’s early onslaught led by their barnstorming no 8 and captain , @entity51			1
@entity39 ’s early penalty put the hosts in front but @entity62 responded with two shots of his own at the other end , before @entity117 ’s men claimed the game ’s first try			0
@entity8 were moving forward with intent near halfway but @entity38 ’s pass was intercepted by @entity173 and the centre burst clear to score by the posts			1
@entity62 added the routine conversion			0
stunned by that setback , @entity8 responded promptly			2
@entity51 broke tackles by @entity70 and @entity58 on the left , then @entity39 sent a clever low kick towards the corner and @entity31 chased through to score			0
@entity1 ’s try re-established @entity5 ’ advantage , with @entity62 adding the conversion from a tight angle , but a @entity35 penalty just before the break gave @entity8 momentum and they took charge after half - time , with the wind at their backs			1
@entity1 of @entity5 races clear to score a try , but the @entity198 side 's lead diminished @entity47 created a second try for @entity200 by charging down @entity202 ’s kick and driving deep into @entity5 ’ 22 seconds later , and the conversion by @entity35 reduced the gap to two points			1
the force was with the home side and hooker @entity208 blazed a trail through the visitors ’ defence on the hour , to pave the way for @entity52 to touch down the match - winning try			1
again , @entity35 added the extras and @entity8 should have extended their lead in the closing stages , but @entity5 hung on gamely to earn a backs - to - the - wall bonus point which may be decisive in a potentially close pool battle			1
@entity5 host @entity221 at @entity223 on sunday and they are optimistic that captain @entity224 — who missed this game with flu — will be available again			2
they know they need to win that home tie to galvanise their @entity7 campaign , but @entity117 was bullish after this game			1
‘ we ’ve lost the battle today but we have n’t lost the war , ’ he said			0
@entity5 ' @entity73 ( left ) leaves the pitch looking dejected after throwing away a nine - point lead			1

@entity7 *debutant* @entity26 helped @entity8 to an *impressive* win
@entity173 's 23rd - minute try was added to by a @entity1 score as @entity5 built a 20 - 11 half - time lead , but it fell apart
@entity1 scored a superb try in the 34th minute to reignite @entity4 prospects
@entity52 scored @entity8 's other try at the @entity19 in @entity125
