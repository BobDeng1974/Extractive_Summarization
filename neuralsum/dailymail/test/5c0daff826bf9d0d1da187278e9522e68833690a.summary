but he missed the farm visit in @entity8 after suffering travel delays , according to a party spokesman			1
in december the @entity4 leader was branded ' silly and dangerous ' after claiming high levels of immigration caused problems on the roads			1
he claimed he arrived too late for a £ 25 - a - head drinks reception in @entity49 because the @entity51 's ' open door immigration ' policy meant that the @entity17 ' is not as navigable as it used to be '			1
he insisted the no - show was ' nothing to do with professionalism ' amid claims @entity4 was struggling to cope with increased scrutiny and demands on his time			2
