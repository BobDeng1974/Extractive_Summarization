ice cream brand @entity0 's has drawn inspiration from one of 2014 's most popular food fads , cookie butter , in order to create a new range of flavors which it believes are good enough to entice even the most dedicated baking enthusiast away from their oven			1
the new additions to the brand 's ' core ' range , a selection of ice creams which include a softer sweet center , are each based on a different cookie flavor			1
@entity20 is described by @entity0 's as ' dark caramel and vanilla ice creams with speculoos cookies and a speculoos cookie butter core '			1
the flavor is based on the same @entity27 spiced shortbread biscuit which features heavily in most cookie butter varieties			0
' @entity53 reporter @entity57 agreed			0
' i love cookie butter so i love the fact that there is now an ice cream filled with it , ' she said			1
' i 'm so glad that they 've included it in the permanent line - up and i will definitely buy it again			2
' the @entity67 variety was also commended on its authentic flavor , with many people marveling at the rich taste - and unique texture of the ice cream , which is described on the @entity0 's website as being ' for peanut butter fans and cookie spread - heads who want it all '			1
according to @entity40 's senior associate photo editor @entity79 , that description hits the nail on the head			2
' the peanut butter was my favorite			2
it felt like i was eating it straight from the jar and the cookie bits were little chunks of heaven that added a nice textural element			0
' but the rich peanut flavor did n't sit well with everyone			0
picture director @entity93 found the peanut taste slightly too ' overwhelming ' and felt that it would have been better had it been paired with chocolate			0
chocolate fix : the most popular of the three new flavors was the @entity99 , which features a delicious chocolate cookie core inspiration : trader @entity103 released these cookie butters last year , much to the delight of its cookie - loving customers ' it was a bit too much peanut butter for me and i prefer it cut with the chocolate ! ' she said			1
' it had nice sized chunks of peanut butter and was a bit more gooey than the other flavors , but paired with the peanut butter ice cream it was all a bit overwhelming			1
' chocolate lovers will no doubt be pleased to hear that the new @entity0 's core line - up also includes a cocoa - rich option too			1
the @entity125 , which is described by the brand as ' mocha and caramel ice creams with chocolate cookies , fudge flakes and a chocolate cookie core ' , proved to be the most popular flavor of the three , with @entity54 editor @entity134 describing it as ' heaven '			2
' i would buy this again in a heartbeat , ' she added			0
' my go to has always been @entity141 but this beats it			0
i love the texture , and i love the harder chocolate bits			0
' it ’s delicious and not too chocolatey			0
' contributing @entity53 editor @entity146 was in total agreement : ' i liked the chocolate the best – and as someone who would never choose chocolate - flavored ice cream , this is saying something			1
' the brownie in the core melted in my mouth			0
