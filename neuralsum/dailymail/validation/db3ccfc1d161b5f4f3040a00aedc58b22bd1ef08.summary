@entity0 will not be featuring any stories based on @entity2 because its producers think the group are too barbaric and too ' evil ' to appear on their show			1
the @entity7 series has dealt with terror cells and double agents across the world , but dramatizing isis and one its leaders @entity12 is not on the agenda			1
executive producer @entity14 revealed that writers have been asked to steer clear of the subject matter as he can not see any way of humanizing their vile actions			1
he confirmed that the show will not be ending anytime soon and leading star @entity30 insisted that she is committed long term too			1
asked about whether @entity2 plot lines would be considered , @entity14 replied : ' it 's a very good question because homeland for the last four seasons has tried to portray our adversaries and tried to humanize them			1
' and if you look at @entity47 , even look at @entity48 , or look at @entity49 this past season there was a real effort to make their concerns and their lives understandable			0
' that is very hard to do with @entity2			0
' it 's very difficult to do because what they are doing on the ground feels so medieval and so horrible that you give them a platform on television i 'm a little wary of ; to try to make what they are talking about understandable or relatable is very difficult			1
gruesome : @entity0 earned a reputation for pushing the envelope with episodes about terrorism and the @entity71 @entity2 has lured converts from around the world to join their murderous rampage across @entity75 and @entity76 ' so we are struggling with that			0
maybe this is too soon , maybe we do n't understand them well enough ; it may be that they are just too evil to dramatize on television			1
' @entity0 has featured drama based on real life encounters that @entity87 intelligence services have dealt with across the world			0
however @entity14 feels that even attempting to portay a character like @entity12 would not work for his critically acclaimed tv series			1
' i think to humanize or to create a sympathetic member of @entity93 right now is a very tall order , that i would be nervous about doing ; i really would ; i think right now the intelligence communities , the @entity87 government does n't really even know how to deal with them on the ground right now			1
' from what i understand @entity99 and @entity75 are leading the charge against @entity93 right now			0
in that part of the world , and the @entity87 is loathed to put boots on the ground and ; we want to stay in the air with these it strikes how effective is that going to be ? we do n't know			1
' so it is a very interesting question and one that we wrestle with because one of the great things about @entity0 is that we are able to comment on on current events in a way is a lot of shows are n't able to do			2
' since 2010 @entity0 has been a high hit around the world picking up honors for its writers and actors including @entity120 and @entity121			2
while offers have flooded into the stars to go elsewhere @entity14 feels the unique bond between the cast and crew has kept their show together			1
he also will delight fans by saying @entity0 will only get better			0
' i do n't think we 've been at the top yet i really do n't			2
we were so fortunate to win the @entity132 in the first year , but we are just getting started on that kind of thing			0
' the great thing about @entity0 is that if you look at every single season is very distinct ; so we are not doing the same show over and over again			2
' you will see season five is so radically different from season four			0
we are going to be two and a half years into the future from from season four , we going to be shooting the series in @entity144 , the show will be set in @entity147 this year , @entity141 will be out of the intelligence agency is going to be a different show again and that is what is it fresh and that is what keeps it ask wanting to do it and we want to keep producing it as a higher level			2
radically different : season five ( pictured ) will be set in @entity144 with @entity141 out of the intelligence agency reinventing : @entity14 insists the show has the potential to change rather than sticking with @entity164 terror @entity30 announced she is staying on as the lead character , adding that it is her ' dream job ' ' and once we stopped doing that then we will stop			1
we 're here to stay for as long as we can make the show that we want to make and feel that it is at a certain level			2
' speaking soon after , leading actress @entity30 confirmed she was committed to the show long - term too			2
she laughed : ' i have to come back			0
' then turning serious , she added : ' it is a dream job and it is a dream company			0
' i am never bored the writers are relentless in redesigning the show every season and she 's naturally dynamic but they put her in such different circumstances and environments that she had different facets of her revealed and to me even			1
she remains vital and novel			0
' @entity30 said she was looking forward to working in @entity184 for the next series			0
