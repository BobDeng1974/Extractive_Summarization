traditional stories passed down through generations by @entity4 aborigines may be among the oldest accurate oral histories in the world , scientists have claimed			1
the findings have allowed them to map how the continent may have looked around 10,000 years ago			0
oral folklore tells how the @entity10 once formed part of the coastline of north east @entity13 , while @entity14 in @entity15 was once a rich place for hunting kangaroo and opossum			1
researchers have found other stories from all over the continent that mirror how the landscape dramatically changed towards the end of the last ice age			1
the @entity10 , off the @entity13 coast , was once part of the mainland according to @entity29 tales they say at this time sea levels rose as a result of the melting of the huge ice caps that covered much of the northern hemisphere around 10,500 years ago			1
the researchers now believe that these stories could constitute some of the oldest accurate oral histories in the world , passing through some 300 generations			1
several stories tell how the @entity10 was once the original coastline of north east @entity13			1
stories told by the @entity44 people describe how a river entered the sea near to what is now called @entity48			1
the @entity50 people who lived in the @entity52 's area of @entity13 also tell how @entity53 was once called ' gabar ' , or lower arm			2
they told how it had once been part of a promontory sticking out from the mainland while nearby @entity59 was four times larger and the @entity48 is now all that is left sticking out the ocean			0
they also describe a place called ' mudaga ' , or pencil cedar , between @entity48 and @entity64 after the trees that once grew there			0
the finding is remarkable as many anthropologists believe that exaggeration and @entity71 whispers often distort oral history so severely that they can no longer be reliable if they are older than 1,000 years old			1
however , dr @entity73 , a linguist at the @entity74 , has found that the stories of @entity76 are astoundingly accurate			0
hidden within myths of seagull gods and ancestral heroes causing seas to rise and great floods are details of how the landscapes looked before the time			0
dr @entity73 studied 18 traditional @entity29 stories and found that they seemed to coincide with true geological events			1
writing for the conversation , he said : ' how do we know that these stories are authentic ? we suggest that because they all say essentially the same thing , it is more likely that they are based on observation			0
' all tell of the ocean rising over areas that had previously been dry			0
none tell stories running the other way – of seas falling to expose land			2
' the huge distances separating the places from which the stories were collected – as well as their unique , local contexts – makes it unlikely that they derived from a common source that was invented			0
' this graphic shows how @entity29 stories from all over @entity113 describe the sea level rise that occurred at the end of the last ice age around 10,000 years ago , causing much of the coastline to be flooded by water @entity119 on the @entity120 in northern @entity113 , like those above , tell stories of how an old woman led flood waters to cut off the area from the mainland and these could have survived for 7,500 to 8,900 years among the stories examined by dr @entity73 and his colleague professor @entity128 , a geographer at the @entity129 , were a tale told by the @entity132 people			1
@entity4 aboriginals are famed for their ancient rock art ( pictured ) , but their oral histories are shedding light on their land 's past too it tells how an ancestral hero called @entity141 chased his wives on foot to @entity144 , where he angrily rose the seas , turning the women into rocks that now jut out of the water between the island and the mainland			2
if this is based on true geographical changes , it would mean it originated at a time when seas were around 100 feet lower than they are today , making it around 9,800 to 10,650 years old			0
another story describes how the @entity158 in the southern @entity159 of @entity160 was once part of a peninsular that jutted out from the mainland			0
the story tells how a ' seagull woman ' called @entity166 swept down and dragged her raft across the neck of the peninsula to allow the sea pour in			0
other stories written down in early colonial times also tell of kangaroo and emu hunting grounds that were later flooded by the rising sea water			1
the @entity177 people of the @entity178 of southern @entity113 told stories that recalled a time when the @entity159 was actually a marshy part of the mainland that was dotted with freshwater lagoons that attracted rich wildlife			1
dr @entity73 estimates that these stories could date from between 9,550 to 12,450 years ago			0
similarly other stories tell how the area of @entity14 in @entity15 was also a marshy part of the mainland , making them around 7,800 to 9,350 years old			2
@entity29 stories confirm that view from @entity144 , above , off the coast of @entity113 would have looked very different around 10,000 years ago before sea levels rose and cut it off from the mainland a tale told by the @entity120 people describe how an old woman followed by a flood of water crawled between the islands of @entity203 and @entity204 , now off the coast of @entity113 's @entity206			2
this , the researchers say , could be telling how the islands were settled and then cut off from the mainland around 8,200 to 9,650 years ago			0
a traditional story from @entity212 tells how @entity213 , @entity214 and @entity215 , once formed part of the mainland and the land was covered in trees			1
the story says that a fire took hold and burned with such intensity that the ground split , allowing the sea to rush in			0
dr @entity73 and his colleagues estimate this would have occurred at least 7,500 to 8,900 years ago			0
dr @entity73 said that their findings suggest that other traditional oral histories passed down in indigenous languages around the world could also provide similar nuggets of truth			2
local folklore in @entity113 tells how some areas that were rich with kangaroo like this were lost to the ocea he said : ' the extraordinary care with which @entity29 people have passed down these stories over previously unimaginable time depths forces a rethink of the ways in which such oral traditions have previously been dismissed			1
' while these examples should not be regarded as a licence for the incautious interpretation the antiquity of oral traditions , or indeed for the belief all such stories have empirical foundations , it does allow for some traditions in some cultures to have survived for far longer than it was once thought any such traditions could			2
' another ancient oral history among the @entity259 of @entity260 is thought to be around 7,700 years old			1
professor @entity128 added that there could also be stories traditional cultures in @entity265 that could be equally as old .			0

traditional stories describe how the @entity10 once formed part of the @entity13 coastline and was studded with rivers and promontories
other tales tell how *modern* day bays were once dry land rich in kangaroo
scientists say they coincide with sea level rise at the end of the last ice age
the stories could constitute an oral history that survived 300 generations
