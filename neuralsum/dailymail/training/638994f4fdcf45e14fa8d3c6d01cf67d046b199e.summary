by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 18:40 est , 21 june 2012 updated : 09:57 est , 22 june 2012 @entity2 got it wrong : @entity3 admits today that his party became disconnected from the concerns of working people about immigration during their 13 years in power @entity3 today promised new measures to prevent @entity11 people being ' locked out ' of jobs by foreign workers , including forcing firms to declare if they employ high numbers of immigrants			1
overseas - only employment agencies would be banned and an early - warning system set up to highlight areas where locals are ' dominated ' by an influx of overseas labour under the proposals			2
while there can not be set quotas on home - grown workers , urgent action is required to identify where @entity11 jobseekers need better training to compete , the @entity2 leader said			1
in a major u-turn , mr @entity3 said the party became ' disconnected from the concerns of working people ' during its 13 years in power			1
@entity2 often tried to silence criticism of its immigration policy by suggesting it was inspired by racism while in office			1
the announcement represents a major change of direction for the party after @entity43 branded voter @entity44 a ' bigoted woman ' for raising concerns about the impact of immigration during the 2010 election campaign			1
mr @entity43 was forced to apologise to @entity50 , 65 , after he met her to smooth over her anger after insulting her			1
it was one of the key moments in the election campaign and was see to signify how out of touch @entity2 had become on immigration			1
as he got into his car , @entity43 was still wired to a @entity59 microphone and was overheard telling an aide : ' that was a disaster			2
. they should never have put me with that woman			2
whose idea was that ? ridiculous			0
' asked what was wrong , @entity43 responded : ' everything , she was just a bigoted woman			1
' mr @entity3 said @entity2 made a mistake by allowing uncontrolled migration into @entity11 in 2004 when @entity74 and other eastern @entity76 states joined the @entity77			1
he said demanding that job centres be told of all firms where more than one in four staff is from overseas would form part of the new system to provide @entity83 and town halls with vital information			0
mr @entity3 hopes to shift the focus of the debate from border controls , and what he says are ineffective @entity91 caps on arrivals , towards the impact on people ’s daily lives			1
while restrictions on new arrivals , including caps on people from any new @entity77 member state , are necessary , reforming the jobs market is just as important , he argued			2
stricter enforcement of minimum wage laws and doubling fines to £ 10,000 would also form part of an effort to stop firms using cheap foreign labour to undercut domestic jobseekers			1
' but we need an economy which offers working people a fair crack of the whip			1
the problem we need to address is in those areas and sectors where local talent is locked out of opportunity			0
' he said @entity2 had to change its approach to immigration and recognise ' the costs as well as the benefits '			2
the last @entity2 government under mr @entity43 became ' too disconnected from the concerns of working people ' , he said			1
' we too easily assumed those who worried about immigration were stuck in the past , unrealistic about how things could be different , even prejudiced , ' he said			0
' but @entity11 was experiencing the largest peacetime migration in recent history , and people ’s concerns were genuine			1
' why did n’t we listen more ? at least by the end of our time in office , we were too dazzled by globalisation and too sanguine about its price			0
@entity74 only : workers after being dropped off at the @entity152 's factory in @entity153 , @entity154 one of @entity156 's biggest meat suppliers caused controversy when it was caught advertising for @entity74 - speaking staff only			2
@entity160 sent the advert to hundreds of job hunters on the books of a @entity154 - based employment agency			0
one was told : ' you have to be fluent because the health and safety training is done in @entity74			0
' the ban on @entity11 applicants , which is illegal under the @entity170 , happened in 2010			2
@entity160 chief executive @entity171 said at the time the advert went out as a result of a ' breakdown in communications '			0
job hunters in the area yesterday complained they often lose out to foreigners			0
@entity179 , 32 , from @entity180 , who lost her cleaning job four months ago , said : ' there are a lot of foreign workers and you are competing against them for even the most basic jobs			1
' it means people like me are being left on the scrapheap			0
i do n't want to be a burden on the taxpayer			0
' does @entity3 's immigrant family past make him best placed to understand the issue ? ' by focusing too much on globalisation and migration ’s impact on growth , we lost sight of who was benefiting from that growth - and the people who were being squeezed			1
and , to those who lost out , @entity2 was too quick to say ‘ like it or lump it ’			2
' mr @entity3 said the numbers of low - skilled immigrants coming to the @entity11 ' are probably still too high and i would like to do something about it '			1
but many of those arrivals were from the @entity77 and so the answer had to lie in reducing the demand for cheap labour rather than any ' blanket promise about numbers '			0
that problem , he added , was being worsened by the government 's proposals - on the back of the @entity221 review - to relax employment laws			0
' of course overall numbers matter but it does also depend on who is coming in and what impact they are having , ' he said when he took questions after the speech			0
' on the question of low - skilled migration , i think numbers are probably still too high and i would like to do something about it			0
' but most of that is from within the @entity77 - because we have tightened up the other routes - and therefore the question on this is how to you change the way your economy works so that employers do not resort to that as their response			0
' a @entity249 spokesman said @entity2 continued to lack ' credibility ' on immigration			1
sir @entity252 , chairman of the @entity254 think - tank , last night welcomed the change of heart , but said it needed to be followed by a change of strategy			0
he said : ' @entity259 apologies are not enough			0
having caused the mass immigration of recent years , will labour now pledge to cut back future immigration , and if so how ? ' mr @entity3 suggested that @entity2 under @entity262 became ' dazzled by globalisation and too sanguine about its price '			1
he said the impact of immigration has had a class divide , with the well - off benefiting from cheap labour , while others find their own jobs and incomes are undercut			2
the @entity2 leader will also outline a string of changes to the party 's approach to immigration			2
he will acknowledge the party made ' a mistake ' in not putting controls on the number of migrants who flocked here from @entity74 and other @entity76 countries after they joined the @entity77			0
countries joining in future , such as @entity287 and @entity288 , should face curbs .			0

@entity2 ' disconnected from concerns of working people ' during 13 years in power , says @entity3
mr @entity3 *launches* a thinly - *veiled* attack on @entity43 who branded @entity44 a ' bigoted woman ' for raising immigration during the 2010 election campaign
@entity2 will seek to enforce the minimum wage to stop foreign workers taking jobs for less than £ 6.08 per hour - and keeping @entity11 employees out
they will clarify the law to stop agencies only giving jobs to migrants
@entity249 say @entity2 still lack ' credibility ' on immigration
