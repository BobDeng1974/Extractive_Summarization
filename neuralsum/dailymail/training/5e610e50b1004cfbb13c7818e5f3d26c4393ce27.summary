by @entity0 published : 04:21 est , 13 march 2012 updated : 20:03 est , 13 march 2012 for @entity2 it was an innocent name designed to chime with the often boozy @entity4 celebrations			1
to others , however , it was a historical affront reviving bitter memories of a @entity9 unit sent to @entity10 to suppress revolt in the 1920s			1
@entity2 has launched its new £ 70 ‘ beer - themed ’ trainer ‘ @entity14 ’ just in time for @entity4 on saturday			1
controversial : @entity2 has provoked outrage by launching a new @entity17 line of trainers for @entity4 but the @entity20 sportswear firm has been accused of ‘ huge insensitivity ’ because the @entity22 was the nickname given to the @entity22 , which became notorious for a brutal crackdown during the independence war			1
one outraged @entity26 @entity20 claimed it was the equivalent of calling a shoe ‘ the @entity29 ’			1
the trainer is officially called the @entity31 , but has been nicknamed @entity14 for its colourings			2
an advertisement for the shoe says : ‘ tis the season for @entity26 beer and why not celebrate with @entity2			1
‘ @entity14 sneaker takes inspiration for the fine balancing act of a stout on top a pale ale in a pint glass			1
’ others @entity26 criticised @entity2 for being ‘ oblivious ’ to the historical connotation			1
@entity46 , president of the @entity20 - based @entity47 , asked : ‘ is there no one at @entity2 able to @entity50 ? ’ yesterday , @entity2 apologised for the name			2
oblivious : @entity2 has been asked why it did not @entity50 the phrase before using it for a new product scandalous : it was the equivalent of calling a shoe ' the @entity29 ' , one leading @entity26 @entity20 said the @entity22 ( right ) were an ad hoc paramilitary units , of @entity9 @entity58 veterans , employed by the @entity22			1
they were created after the @entity58 by @entity59 , faced with a increasing tide of violence from the @entity62 which had launched a campaign to drive @entity9 out of @entity10			2
although established to target the @entity62 , they became notorious through their numerous attacks on the @entity26 civilian population			1
they were ordered , as temporary constables from 1920 to 1921 , to suppress revolution in @entity10			2
the catholic cardinal of the day called them ' a horde of savages , some of them simply brigands , burglars and thieves '			2
the unit 's nickname arose from the colour of the improvised khaki uniforms initially worn by its members			1
@entity17 is also the name given to a popular drink made by mixing stout and pale ale - usually @entity87 and @entity88 or @entity89			1
a spokesman said : ‘ it is not the official name of the shoe			2
it has been unofficially named by some using the phrase and we recognise it can be viewed as inappropriate and insensitive			2
we apologise and no offence was intended			2
’ six years ago ice cream firm @entity99 ’s caused a furore when it launched a @entity17 flavour			1
the product was quickly withdrawn			2
given the nickname of the @entity22 for their improvised uniforms , its members used uncompromising measures to enforce @entity9 ' @entity108 ' in @entity10 - and were deeply unpopular as a result			0
in an advert for the trainer , officially called the @entity31 , but dubbed the ' @entity17 ' for its colourings , it is stated : 't is the season for @entity26 beer and why not celebrate with @entity2			1
' @entity14 sneaker takes inspiration for the fine balancing act of a @entity118 ( @entity87 ) on top a @entity119 ( @entity88 ) in a pint glass			2
' and online shoe store kicksonfire said : ' beer drinkers can rejoice soon as their favourite pastime is slated to have an official piece of footwear endorsed by @entity31			0
' the @entity132 ’ is set to hit shelves in roughly 10 days and if the last photo set we showed you was n’t enough these should definitely hit the spot			0
' the leather trimmed sneakers feature a gradient suede portion that goes from black to tan and is highlighted by a creamy swoosh			0
' the insoles also give a shout to the stout by featuring an image of a pint glass			0
these may ultimately be pretty hard to find as they are a quick strike release but do n’t let them pass without a fight			0
' outrage : the new shoe has , critics say , evoked memories of the @entity22 ( right ) who became notorious for a brutal crackdown on ordinary @entity26 men and women during the @entity153 crackdown : @entity9 police , known as @entity22 for their mix - and - match military outfits of dark wool and khaki , hold a suspected @entity159 member at gunpoint and search him for weapons @entity2 , however , said the name was not its officially given one , but had been given it by ' some ' - even though it appears on many retailer websites as @entity166 '			1
a spokeswoman said : ' it is not the official name of the shoe			0
it has been unofficially named by some using the phrase and we recognise it can be viewed as inappropriate and insensitive			0
' we apologise and no offence was intended			0
' the @entity87 , which it was launched alongside , has a higher ankle support and is black , white and brown			0
athough only deployed from 1920 to 1922 , nationalist @entity177 still associates the @entity22 with murder , brutality , massacre and indiscipline in the years leading to southern @entity10 's independence			0
promotion : @entity177 says @entity184 will be going green to mark @entity4 on saturday in bad taste : @entity186 has come under fire for this series of @entity4 t - shirts historians say there is no dispute that ' the @entity193 ' killed and destroyed on a large scale , and recorded that when a @entity22 was killed in @entity195 , they burnt down more than 300 buildings			1
the catholic cardinal of the day called them ' a horde of savages , some of them simply brigands , burglars and thieves '			0
they were created after the @entity58 by @entity59 , faced with a increasing tide of violence from the @entity62 which had launched a campaign to drive @entity9 out of @entity10			0
lt col @entity208 , one of their leading commanders , is often quoted to sum up the orders they were given and the reason behind their behaviour			0
merry : @entity4 is celebrated by the @entity26 all over the world , especially in @entity217 where there are parades and various other events he said , in june 1920 : ' if a police barracks is burned or if the barracks already occupied is not suitable , then the best house in the locality is to be commandeered , the occupants thrown into the gutter			1
let them die there - the more the merrier			0
' should the order ( @entity232 ) not be immediately obeyed , shoot and shoot with effect			0
if the persons approaching ( a patrol ) carry their hands in their pockets , or are in any way suspicious - looking , shoot them down			0
' you may make mistakes occasionally and innocent persons may be shot , but that can not be helped , and you are bound to get the right parties some time			0
' the more you shoot , the better i will like you , and i assure you no policeman will get into trouble for shooting any man			0
' alongside : the @entity87 , launched at the same time as the @entity17 , has a higher ankle support and comes in different colours			1
