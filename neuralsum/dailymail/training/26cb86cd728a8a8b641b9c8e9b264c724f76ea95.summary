by @entity1 reporter last updated at 1:55 pm on 22nd june 2011 loophole : @entity3 's health care law will let millions of middle - class people get nearly free insurance meant for the poor an anomaly in @entity3 's controversial healthcare law will allow millions of relatively well - off people to qualify for @entity11 , it emerged today			1
the loophole , which was only discovered after the complex bill was signed , will give some couples earning four times the federal poverty level entitlement to nearly free insurance meant for the poor			1
it means a married couple who have both retired early could have an annual income of about $ 64,000 and still get @entity11 , according to officials who make long - range cost estimates for the @entity23 department			1
after initially downplaying any concern , the @entity3 administration said late yesterday that it would look for a fix			1
up to three million people could qualify for @entity11 in 2014 as a result of the anomaly			1
that 's because , in a major change from today , most of their @entity33 benefits would no longer be counted as income for determining eligibility			0
a married couple who have both retired early could have an annual income of about $ 64,000 and still get @entity11 , it has emerged medicare chief actuary @entity40 says the situation keeps him up at night			1
‘ i do n't generally comment on the pros or cons of policy , but that just does n't make sense , ’ @entity40 said during a question - and - answer session at a recent professional society meeting			2
it 's almost like allowing middle - class people to qualify for food stamps , he suggested			1
‘ this is a situation that got no attention at all , ’ added @entity40			0
‘ and even now , as i raise the issue with various policymakers , people are not rushing to say ... we need to do something about this			2
’ president @entity3 , surrounded by lawmakers , signs the healthcare insurance reform legislation during a ceremony in the the @entity64 on march 23 , 2010 indeed , administration officials and senior @entity67 lawmakers say it 's not a loophole but the result of a well - meaning effort to simplify rules for deciding who will get help with insurance costs under the new health care law			1
instead of a hodgepodge of rules , there will be one national policy			0
‘ this simplification will stop people from falling into coverage gaps and may cause some to be newly eligible for @entity11 and others to no longer qualify , ’ said @entity80 , spokesman for the @entity81			1
but states have been clamouring for relief from @entity11 costs , complaining that just these sorts of federal rules drive up spending and limit state options			2
the program is now one of the top issues in budget negotiations between the @entity64 and @entity97			0
@entity98 are pushing for a rollback of federal requirements that block states from limiting eligibility			0
public opinion : protesters in @entity105 made their views clear			0
critics have also attacked mr @entity3 over a system they feel mirrors @entity110 's ailing @entity109 people hold up signs as they attend a town hall meeting on healthcare reform in @entity105 @entity11 is a safety net program that serves more than 50 million vulnerable @entity116 , from low - income children and pregnant women to @entity120 's patients in nursing homes			1
it 's designed as a federal - state partnership , with @entity123 paying close to 60 per cent of the total cost			2
early retirees would be a new group for @entity11			2
while retirees can now start collecting @entity33 at age 62 , they must wait another three years to get @entity129 , unless they 're disabled			0
some early retirees who worked all their lives may not want to be associated with a health care program for the poor , but others might see it as a relatively painless way to satisfy the new law 's requirement that all @entity116 carry medical insurance starting in 2014			1
it would help tide them over until they turn 65 and qualify for @entity129			0
the actuary 's office said the three million early retirees who would become eligible for @entity11 are on top of an estimated 16 million to 20 million people that @entity3 's law would already bring into the program , by opening it to childless adults with incomes near the poverty level			1
federal taxpayers will cover all of the initial cost of the expansion			0
heated issue : the debate over healthcare caused violent outbreaks at town hall meetings like this one is @entity162 , @entity163 in the summer of 2009 a spokeswoman for the @entity165 , which wrote much of the health care law , said if the situation does become a problem there 's plenty of time to fix it later			0
‘ these changes do n't take effect until 2014 , so we have time to review all possible cases to ensure @entity11 meets its mission of serving only the neediest @entity116 , ’ said @entity172			2
but @entity98 already see a problem			0
former @entity180 governor @entity179 said adding early retirees will ‘ just add fuel to the fire , ’ bolstering the argument from @entity98 governors that some of @entity123 's rules do n't make sense			0
‘ the fact that this is being discovered now tells you , what else is baked into this law ? ’ said mr @entity179 , who served as @entity23 secretary under president @entity190 .			0

some couples earning up to $ *64k* a year - four times poverty level - entitled to free insurance for the poor
up to *3m* people could qualify for @entity11 in 2014
@entity3 administration now looking for a fix
