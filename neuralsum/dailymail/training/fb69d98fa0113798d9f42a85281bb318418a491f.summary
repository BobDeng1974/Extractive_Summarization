stepping out onto the clear ledge , @entity40 said that his brother and two cousins began to hear the distinctive and in this situation , terrifying sound of cracking glass			1
' all of us collectively start getting up , and it ’s at that point that we hear and feel the glass start shattering			0
mind you , this is happening in an instant			0
incredibly fast , ' said @entity40 's cousin , @entity136 to @entity137			2

' i walked them over so they could see and they were totally shocked and asked us to step away and then proceeded to start calling staff and techs and i do n't know who else			0
when we pulled our phones to start recording and take pictures they asked us to leave right away , ' he said			0
indeed , in video recorded by @entity40 , the ominous slow creaking noise of breaking glass can be heard			1

' @entity7 is open today while the protective coating is being replaced , ' said @entity164 , a spokesman for public relations firm @entity165			1
' we have temporarily closed the four ledge boxes for routine inspection we hope to reopen them shortly			2
' not for the faint hearted : visitors are protected from the 103 - storey drop by three inches of glass spectacular : the boxes that jut out from the @entity3 provide never - before - seen views of the city , and allows spectators to see for 50 miles around @entity179 's second tallest : the @entity3 , formerly the @entity3 , is the world 's 8th tallest building			1
the four viewing boxes can be seen on the third windows down from the top on the left of the skyscraper @entity164 added that the visitors were never in any danger			2
' this coating does not affect the structural integrity of @entity30 in any way			1
occasionally , the coating will crack , as it is designed to in order to protect the surface of the glass , ' @entity164 said in a statement			2
@entity3 general manager @entity195 said the @entity196 is safe but should give off ' the illusion that it ’s not safe			1
'' we hid the railings , we hid the structural steel — we want to give the illusion that it ’s a little bit , ‘ can i take these two steps out of the building ? ’ ' he told the @entity61			0
a spokesman for the @entity3 said that what cracked was a protective coating on the top of three layers of glass one half - inch thick			1
' occasionally this happens , but that ’s because we designed it this way , ' said @entity215 to the @entity216			0
' whatever happened last night is a result of the protective coating doing what it ’s designed to			2
' @entity215 added that this is not the first time the protective coating has cracked			2
usually it is caused by a visitor having something sharp in their pocket that scratches or cracks the coating			0
