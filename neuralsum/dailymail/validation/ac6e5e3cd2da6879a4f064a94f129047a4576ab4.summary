@entity1 's rich neighbours have blown nearly half a million pounds fighting over a leaky gutter that would have cost just £ 7,000 to fix			1
multi-millionaire property tycoon @entity3 - who lives next door to the former @entity5 - has been at war for years with surveyor , @entity7 , whose £ 20million mansion adjoins her own listed home			1
the trouble between the pair centres on water overflowing from a blocked gutter on an extension at the back of mr @entity7 's house and creating a damp problem in mrs @entity3 's mansion next door			1
now a county court judge has ordered mr @entity7 to alter his house and pay his neighbour £ 250,000 in costs and damages , leaving him facing an estimated total bill for the dispute approaching half a million pounds			1
a row broke out between the owners of these two west @entity29 mansions over a £ 7,000 leaky gutter the owners of the properties , which neighbour @entity1 's home , ended up going to court over the dispute and paid hundreds of thousands in legal fees the court heard that wealthy widow mrs @entity3 , 84 , moved into her home in @entity38 , @entity29 , 35 years ago			1
sir @entity1 lives next door , in a house not far from the famous abbey road studios			0
both mrs @entity3 and mr @entity7 are friends with the former @entity5 , judge @entity41 told @entity43 , commenting that mrs @entity3 ' enjoyed an excellent relationship with her famous neighbour			1
' however the court heard that the relationship between mrs @entity3 and mr @entity7 is less friendly , and that since he bought his house in the late 1990s , she has been ' embroiled in a number of disputes ' with him			0
@entity51 , for mrs @entity3 , told the judge that the dispute between the neighbours sprang out of a long - standing gripe about defective guttering on a glass - roofed extension to the back of the @entity7 ' palatial house			2
the extension , built in 1997 , had inadequate guttering when it was put up , which mr @entity7 had also allowed to become blocked with leaves and other debris , the barrister said , causing damp problems in the day room , kitchen and garage of mrs @entity3 's own mansion			0
@entity3 ( left ) insisted the extension of neighbour @entity7 ( right ) was ruining her own home miss @entity51 told the judge : ' mrs @entity3 is an elderly widow who has occupied her house for 35 years			1
she added : ' mrs @entity3 seeks injunctive relief requiring @entity7 and mrs @entity76 to rebuild the roof of the extension in such a way as to prevent rainwater running down to collect in the gutter and thence penetrating into [ her home ]			2
' @entity83 , for mr @entity7 , denied that mr @entity7 had caused a ' nuisance ' to his neighbour and dismissed expert reports linking the damp in mrs @entity3 's home to the gutter as ' erroneous			1
' the barrister said that mr @entity7 and his wife @entity90 , an interior designer , put the blame for the malfunctioning guttering on mrs @entity3 's own wisteria plant , which they claimed was causing the blockage , and which was none of their responsibility			2
but judge @entity41 branded the extension as ' bog standard ' and not in keeping with an area famed for its celebrity residents			0
he found the gutter had been blocked by lack of maintenance and obstructed by pipes carrying water to and from a swimming pool			0
sir @entity1 lives next to the warring pair in this home and is said to be friends with both of them the judge said : ' since mr @entity7 acquired [ her home ] she has found herself embroiled in a number of disputes , which must have been very trying for a lady of 84 years of age , ' he went on			2
' mrs @entity3 first noticed damp in 2003 and raised the question of damp with mr @entity7 in 2011 , and proceedings were launched in 2014			0
she suffered damp in two of the most important rooms in her house and her troubles are not yet over			0
' criticising mr @entity7 , the judge said : ' any responsible householder knows that gutters get blocked			0
it is unacceptable that , having built a gutter right against his neighbour 's wall , mr @entity7 did n't have a system of maintenance			1
' mr @entity7 has shown himself to be incapable of maintaining the guttering , even when it was clear that this litigation had been commenced , ' he added			0
sir @entity1 's home is separated from the two homes in the case and was he was not involved in the case of the extension the judge said : ' this was a bog standard construction , not of good quality for a terraced house in @entity146 , a semi-detached in @entity148 and certainly not in line with the quality of this detached house in @entity38 , which has been valued , modestly , at £ 20million			1
' dismissing mr @entity7 's attempt to blame mrs @entity3 's wisteria he said : ' i reject that argument - i do n't accept that the wisteria was the primary cause of the blockage at the rear of the gutter			2
' it was substantially cut back from time to time and i do n't accept that it could have contributed to blocking the gutter by growing into it			0
' the judge ordered mr @entity7 to pay his neighbour £ 27,000 damages to repair her house , plus £ 50,000 for loss of amenity			1
he also granted an injunction , compelling mr @entity7 to have his extension roof reconstructed and re-angled so that rainwater pours towards his own property , not the house next door			0
mr @entity7 was ordered to pay mrs @entity3 over £ 170,000 for her legal costs			2
his own lawyers bill is likely to be a similar sum			0
the judge concluded by saying that it would have cost mr @entity7 about £ 7,000 to get a contractor to fix the leaky gutter , and thus avoid the costly court case			1
mrs @entity3 said outside court afterwards ' i 'm just very happy that , after years of litigation , i 've won			0
