by @entity0 published : 13:38 est , 11 november 2013 updated : 19:15 est , 11 november 2013 two midwives responsible for a sick woman 's four - day - old baby lay the child on its stomach and left it in a stationery cupboard , a tribunal has heard			1
@entity10 and @entity11 are accused of failing to provide appropriate clinical care to a baby while working on a night shift at @entity15 , @entity16 , north east @entity17			1
ms @entity10 , 35 , who has worked as a nurse since 2004 , was responsible for looking after the baby while its mother caught up on sleep , the @entity23 ( @entity23 ) was told			1
it is alleged that she tended to the baby , known as @entity26 , in a cot by the midwives station before moving it into a large stationery cupboard after it became unsettled			1
@entity10 ( left ) was responsible for looking after the baby while its mother caught up on sleep			1
both she and ms @entity11 ( right ) are also accused of failing to record any feeds given to @entity26 she and ms @entity11 , 46 , are also accused of failing to record any feeds given to @entity36 both midwives deny all allegations			1
the alleged incident , which occurred on 18 april , 2011 , was reported by @entity40 , a nursery nurse at the hospital who found the baby alone in the cupboard at about 6:30am			1
she told the tribunal : ' i went to the post-natal ward to get an envelope from the stationery cupboard and found a baby lying on its tummy on its own			1
' the baby was in the cot just behind the door			1
i can not remember whether the light was off or on , but i saw baby on its front and went to check if it was breathing			2
' this was an unusual occurrence			0
we always lie a baby on its back as there is a risk of cot death			1
' if , as a nursery nurse , i took responsibility for a parent ’s baby , i would never leave it alone			2
if i needed to go off and do something , i would ask another nurse to look after the baby			2
' @entity74 , the case presenter at the @entity23 , said : ' the baby ’s mother has a health condition and it is vitally important for her to get a good night ’s sleep			1
midwife @entity10 leaves the @entity23 ( @entity23 ) , in central @entity17 , where she is facing allegations alongside of failing to provide appropriate clinical care to a baby ' her husband therefore invited the midwives to take the baby away so that his wife could get a good night ’s sleep			1
' that decision was not taken lightly			0
the nurse looking after @entity26 ’s mother was involved in that decision			0
it was the right thing to do			0
' mr @entity74 explained that the baby became unsettled at ' various points ' throughout the night , adding that there was ' no specific place to put a baby ' while it was looked after in the post-natal ward			1
he said that ms @entity10 and ms @entity11 had both confirmed that ms @entity10 had placed @entity26 in a cot in the doorway of the cupboard , but claim that the door was kept open			1
mr @entity74 said : ' there came a stage where ms @entity10 was called away to another patient and was away for about 20 minutes			1
' the next thing that happened was a member of the nursing staff went to the cupboard and was shocked to find @entity26 inside			2
midwife @entity11 is accused of failing to record any feeds given to @entity26 ' the door was closed			1
the baby was found on its stomach , but babies are always placed on their back to avoid cot death			2
' he added : ' there were no feeding charts for @entity121 the reality of that was that entries that were made about feeds did n’t coincide with what the registrants record about the feeds			0
' there was a question of whether @entity26 may have been overfed			0
' @entity131 , a midwife who was working alongside the midwives that evening , said : ' the first time i encountered @entity133 was at 1.30am			2
i went to the midwives ’ station and noticed @entity26 in its cot			1
' i remember that the father of the baby came out of the room [ where his wife was sleeping ] at 2.30am , complaining that the mother could still hear the baby crying			2
she could therefore not sleep			0
' i recommended that the baby be cared for at the nursery , but ms @entity10 and ms @entity11 said they were coping ok and would keep the baby there			1
this decision was made jointly between the two midwives			0
' ms @entity131 , who has been a midwife at the hospital since 2001 , told the tribunal that she had two further encounters with the baby , when she fed and changed it			0
she continued : ' when i returned [ to the midwife station ] , @entity26 had been placed in darkened section of the area			0
ms @entity11 was looking after the baby at this time			1
' she was by the desk and @entity26 was fast asleep on [ its ] back			0
we do not allow babies under three months old to sleep on their front			0
' at 6am i went to the nurses ’ cupboard to retrieve my stethoscope , which i keep in my bag			0
at this time , @entity26 was still in her cot in the darkened area of the midwives ’ station			1
' i went to to my patients and when i returned back to the midwives station later i did not know where the baby was , but i assumed it had been taken back to its mother			1
' @entity40 said the baby was in a cupboard and it had vomited all over itself and it was suffocating in an airless cupboard			2
@entity26 was fast asleep and the sheets were clean			0
' ms @entity10 told me that the baby had not been in the cupboard			1
she told me that @entity26 had been wedged in the door way			0
' an internal investigation was carried out by the hospital which found that @entity26 had been overfed and there were poor records of the feedings			0
@entity197 , supervisory midwife who conducted a preliminary investigation , said there were no guidelines for midwives caring for babies in that situation			0
mr @entity74 explained that the baby became unsettled at ' various points ' throughout the night , adding that there was ' no specific place to put a baby ' while it was looked after she said : ' i was asked to investigate the incident , my role was to investigate the clinical care surrounding the incident			1
' i looked at the guidelines on the post-natal ward and found there was no applicable policy or procedures on how to act in these circumstances			0
' i discovered that @entity26 had been overfed , there were no clear records of the feeding			0
' i believe the baby had been overfed by the midwives			2
' i concluded that there were no care issues during the incident			0
' apart from @entity40 not one other person saw the baby in the cupboard and it was all denied from every person i spoke to			2
' if there had been more evidence of @entity26 being in the cupboard it absolutely would have triggered a care issue but i had no other evidence apart from one person			2
' @entity26 was a well baby so there would be no requirement for that baby to have a feeding chart			0
' the baby was fed although it was overfed			0
' a further investigation was carried out which led to both nurses being suspended			0
@entity246 , associate human resources director at @entity15 , said : ' i was asked to investigate a complaint on april 20 in 2011 , raised by @entity40			0
' @entity248 was the named midwife and was unable to provide satisfactory care explanation for the duration of the shift			1
' there was a lack of clarity for who was caring for @entity36 ' miss @entity11 did have a significant level of involvement in the care of @entity26 , she could n't clearly outline the care when she had actually taken part in it			1
' @entity248 engaged with the process well and was consistent but miss @entity264 was unresponsive and unwilling to engage			0
' miss @entity11 was reluctant to accept responsibility for @entity266 ' the incident brought the hospital into disrepute due to the publicity in the @entity271 ' it exacerbated bad publicity we were experiencing as a trust , impacted on staff morale and the feelings of expectant mothers in the trust			2
sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
