by @entity1 reporter published : 04:18 est , 11 june 2012 updated : 05:35 est , 11 june 2012 in the past 12 years , @entity2 has witnessed the death of her mother and the birth of her granddaughter			1
but she did not grieve or celebrate as she experienced life 's sorrows and joys			0
this is because she has been unable to feel strong emotions for more than a decade due to heart drugs she had to take in order to survive			2
the drugs , which she had to take to stop a heart condition which caused her pulse to race at 250 beats a minute , saved mrs @entity2 ’s life but left her unable to feel happiness or sadness			1
@entity2 is delighted to feel strong emotions today ( left )			1
she found it difficult to feel joy at the birth of her granddaughter @entity25 in 2005 ( pictured together right ) mrs @entity2 would even remain completely calm in the face of loud noises , which startled those around her and left them with racing hearts			1
for 12 years she could n’t even have an argument			1
during that time mrs @entity2 was prescribed flecainide , verapamil and verapress to control her heart arrhythmia but all of them left her with the same life - altering side effect			1
mrs @entity2 , a teacher from @entity40 , @entity41 , said the life without highs or lows was a huge struggle			1
mrs @entity2 was prescribed flecainide , verapamil and verapress over the years			1
@entity48 belongs to the group of medicines known as antiarrhythmics			0
it works directly on the heart tissue and will slow the nerve impulses in the heart			0
lack of feeling or emotion is a rare side - effect of the drug according to the @entity61			0
@entity62 is known as a calcium - channel blocker because it works by affecting the way calcium passes into certain muscle cells.the most common side - effect is constipation , however there have been reports of it causing drowsiness and sluggishness			0
@entity75 contains verapamil and works in a similar way			0
it can cause fatigue and dizziness			0
anyone experiencing unexpected symptoms when taking a new heart medication should consult their gp			0
some side - effects are temporary and disappear as the body adjusts to the medication			0
she said : ' if someone jumped out on me , i would n’t feel frightened at all			1
i ’d just stay calm			0
' i did n’t experience the normal highs and lows of emotions for those 12 years			1
it was like i did n’t have my normal life and did n’t feel the race or excitement of it			1
' when my mum died i grieved but i felt like i was in control far more than my family around me			2
i never had the huge sobbing distraught episodes i otherwise would have done			0
' then when my granddaughter @entity25 was born , i would feel some joy , but not the magic and deeper level of adrenaline you want to feel in those moments			1
' i would n’t feel the elation that others would			1
' i had some fantastic holidays to places like @entity115 and @entity116 in that time too but they were spoiled a bit because i never felt of the buzz of looking forward to them			2
' mrs @entity2 ’s condition began in 1999 when suddenly her heart began race at a dangerous rate , even when she was resting			1
the mother - of - one feared she could have a heart attack at any moment and was prescribed tablets to control her heartbeat			0
but even with a busy lifestyle , she felt her life was still held back by the devastating side effects of the drugs			2
trips to visit @entity25 and daughter @entity134 , 28 , where they lived in @entity136 , became a routine rather joyous family event she could look forward to			0
as her condition progressed , she began to experience palpitations , breathlessness and dizziness as the drugs suppressed her body ’s adrenaline in order to bring her heart rate down to normal			1
delight : @entity2 with her daughter @entity134 and granddaughter @entity25 in @entity150			1
she can now feel normal highs and lows it meant she felt she has missed out on key moments in her life with granddaughter @entity25 , six , and her @entity157 , @entity158 , 82 , who passed away in 2005			1
she said : ' when i first went to hospital they put me on adenosine which would send my body into severe pain for a few seconds as all my organs would scream out for oxygen as the heart tried to slow down			0
' but then it was a case of persevering with tablets of the three different drugs			0
' there are more times than i can count that i had to be taken from work in an ambulance to the hospital			0
it would take me three or four days to recover			0
@entity2 said she could n't feel deep grief after her mother @entity158 died ( @entity158 is pictured with @entity2 's daughter @entity134 in 1987 ) ' i was a bag of nerves not knowing when these attacks would strike and they really impacted on my life , i just stopped doing things in the end			1
' then in 2010 , she began suffering racing heartbeats again after her body became immune to the medication			0
fortunately doctors decided last october mrs @entity2 could undergo ablation surgery to resolve the problem by burning away the heart tissue and electrical pathways causing the attacks			2
consultant cardiologist and heart arrhythmia expert dr @entity197 operated on mrs @entity2 at @entity201 ’s @entity200 to complete success			2
he lasered the tachycardia depressions in her heart and within days she was able to feel heightened emotions			2
she feels she has now been given a new lease of life and can again experience the normal emotions she wants			2
her family celebrated by taking @entity25 on a trip to see @entity211 in @entity150 last december , the first holiday mrs @entity2 says she had felt excited about in over a decade			1
she said : ' i am delighted to be able to enjoy seeing @entity25 and feeling how i should			0
it ’s great to feel the emotion when she laughs or smiles			2
' the trip to @entity150 was amazing and it really gave me a buzz i had n’t had in so long			1
' although i missed out on the feeling you get in your heart of overwhelming joy and excitement of her birth and the six years since , i intend to make up for the lost time			1
' looking back i was always so calm			0
people around me would be rushing around but i just felt so relaxed about everything			2
' i was also very tired though , and looking back i do n’t how i got up in the morning , went to school , taught all day and then came home and worked			2
' now , i feel like i ’m in my 20s again			0
it ’s a fantastic procedure , the hospital were wonderful and i hope others can benefit from it			0

' i did n’t experience the normal highs and lows , ' says @entity2 , who ' found it difficult ' to feel joy at the birth of her granddaughter
