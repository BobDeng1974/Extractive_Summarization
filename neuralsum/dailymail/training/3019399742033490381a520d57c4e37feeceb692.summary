by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 published : 18:34 est , 24 february 2013 updated : 11:43 est , 25 february 2013 @entity3 today refused to change course on his austerity plan despite the pound slumping to a new low today as investors reacted to the loss of @entity12 's gold - plated @entity10 credit rating			1
the chancellor was called to the commons this afternoon to be grilled by mps after the @entity12 's currency fell to its lowest level against the dollar for nearly three years and hit a 16 - month low against the euro			1
the pound fell sharply to $ 1.51 and was as low as 1.14 euros today , compared with 1.23 euros earlier this year and close to 1.29 euros in last july			1
it means that £ 500 in a @entity12 tourist ’s pocket is now worth just 570 euros – compared with € 645 last year			1
under fire : chancellor @entity3 faces criticism from all sides after @entity12 lost its gold - plated @entity10 credit rating by contrast , the @entity27 rose by more than 30 points , suggested that the downgrade did not come as a surprise to investors who had grown used to bad news from @entity12 after a run of disappointing economic announcements			1
mr @entity3 insisted : ' we will go on delivering on the economic plan that has brought the deficit down by a quarter			1
' he told @entity15 there had not been ' excessive volatility ' as the markets gave their reaction to the @entity44 's decision			0
@entity45 has been locked into a downward spiral over the past week amidst fears the @entity48 could re-start its quantitative easing programme , fuelling inflation			2
mr @entity3 told mps the decision by @entity44 's was a ' stark reminder of the debt problems built up in @entity12 over the last decade and a warning to anyone who thinks we can run away from dealing with those problems '			1
however , @entity60 's @entity59 noted that mr @entity3 mr @entity3 had made maintaining the @entity10 rating a key benchmark for his stewardship of the economy ,			1
' the first economic test he set himself , now failed by this downgraded chancellor , ' mr @entity59 said			2
the ftse , which is strongly influenced by the performance of international firms , held on to its recent gains , climbing 34 points to 6370 by 2.45 this afternoon			0
@entity45 's continuing losses could mean misery for holidaymakers , who have already seen the value of the pound fall by seven per cent this year , and put an extra squeeze on consumers by pushing up the cost of everything from petrol to pasta			1
in a fresh blow to the chancellor , his @entity84 @entity83 colleague and former chancellor @entity81 admitted yesterday it will take ‘ years ’ to re-establish ‘ sensible economic growth ’ in @entity12			1
and business secretary @entity89 warned mr @entity3 that producing another ‘ slash and burn ’ austerity budget would be ‘ utterly foolish ’ and demanded more action on growth			1
in signs of a growing @entity96 row over the economy , deputy prime minister @entity93 said : ‘ we ’re not just balancing the books – we need to do a whole lot more than that			0
’ despite the downgrade , @entity103 's official spokesman insisted today that the government 's economic plan was ' working ' and the prime minister remained committed to seeing it through			2
' the plan is working and that is why we believe the economy is healing , ' the spokesman told a daily @entity115 press briefing			0
treasury sources say the chancellor ’s budget , due in three weeks , will be an ‘ unabashed budget for business ’ and is expected to include corporation tax cuts			0
but he faces the immediate prospect of a run on the pound after the downgrade by credit ratings agency @entity44			2
mr @entity81 admitted the pound is no longer seen as a ‘ safe haven ’			1
he told @entity127 : ‘ it ’s going to take several more years of this in order to get back not just our credit rating but to get back to sensible economic growth			1
’ while the problems set the stage for a crunch budget in three weeks time , mr @entity89 warned against £ 10billion of fresh cuts the @entity137 want to use to balance the books			0
he said : ‘ to embark on a slash and burn policy in response to this would be utterly foolish and counterproductive			0
the real thing we have to focus on is the real economy and getting growth back			2
’ citing as examples the @entity148 and @entity149 , both downgraded last year , he also argued the loss of the aaa rating was ‘ largely symbolic ’ , adding : ‘ in terms of the real economy there is no reason why the downgrade should have any impact			2
’ mr @entity3 is also under fire from @entity84 mps such as @entity160 , who said they must cut taxes or lose the next election			1
the @entity164 mp and self - made millionaire called on the government to phase out employers ’ national insurance contributions and halve the corporation tax on profits to 12.5 per cent			0
others warned mr @entity3 is in the ‘ last chance saloon ’			2
one senior backbencher said : ‘ @entity174 must go			0
’ another said : ‘ he faces a fundamental issue of credibility			0
’ foolhardy : the chancellor chose to wear the rating as a badge of honour and must now live with the consequences after the downgrade @entity3 has , in many ways , only himself to blame for the political backlash as a result of @entity12 losing its prized @entity10 credit rating			1
the chancellor chose to wear the rating as a badge of honour , constantly referring to it as the rewards of @entity12 ’s budgetary discipline			1
by doing so , he has been hoist by his own petard			0
in itself , the downgrade is of little consequence			0
both the @entity148 in 2011 and @entity149 last year lost their top - notch standing without any noticeable impact on their ability to borrow on global markets at very low rates			0
@entity12 will always be regarded as a good credit risk			1
this is because the average age of the nation ’s bonds or gilt edged stock that issued is for 15 years – a far longer maturity than other leading nations			2
as a result the country is not constantly having to ask the market to buy newly issued bonds or gilts to replace old ones			0
also , what sets the @entity12 apart from @entity221 ( and even @entity222 ) is that we have never , in our entire history , failed to pay back our debt			2
the biggest risk for @entity3 is that the loss of our credit standing leads to a lengthy and destabilising run on the pound			1
the currency has already fallen a sharp 7 per cent in value against the dollar and the euro since the start of the year			0
so far , this reduction has been viewed with quiet satisfaction by the @entity48 governor			0
even though it means higher prices for imported food and energy , policy makers believe the best hope for restoring growth is a cheaper pound , making @entity12 goods and services more competitive in the global marketplace			1
but there is a very big difference between a gentle slide in the currency of the kind that has already taken place , and the panic - selling that occurs when the markets lose confidence in a nation ’s ability to stabilise its affairs			0
realistically , there is no reason for a run on the pound			0
however slow the @entity12 ’s economic growth and however big our debt mountain , the @entity12 ’s problems are as nothing compared to those of the wounded euroland			1
and if markets were rational they would take no notice at all of what the credit rating agencies have to say			1
after all , it was these very same organisations that stamped the toxic @entity148 sub-prime mortgage debt as @entity10 before the financial crisis			0
nevertheless , it would be irresponsible for the chancellor if the weekend ’s events were not to lead to some rethinking of economic strategy ahead of the budget			2
@entity3 needs to do two things simultaneously			2
he needs to slash a welfare budget that is still increasing at an unacceptable pace and move rapidly to improve growth by getting the banks lending again to households and small businesses			0
most importantly he needs to radically reform a tax system so onerous that companies move mountains to avoid paying tax and are refusing to invest in their businesses			0
the truth is that more imaginative policies are required by the chancellor to rekindle growth in output and put the setback of a lost credit rating behind him			1
so far , truly bold initiatives have been sadly lacking when it has come to boosting output .			0

@entity45 stands at $ 1.51 and € 1.14 today after @entity12 *stripped* of credit rating
@entity311 could mean misery for holidaymakers and push up cost of living
@entity3 to face grilling from mps in the commons
@entity81 has admitted it will take ' years ' to re-establish economic growth
