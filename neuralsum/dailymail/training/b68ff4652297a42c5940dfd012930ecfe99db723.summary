health secretary @entity0 announced last night that an ‘ army ’ of 18,000 people would be deployed by the health service to provide social care to the growing ageing population			1
the @entity21 is intended to prevent 2,000 people a year being admitted to expensive nursing homes and also prevent 160,000 hospital admissions every year , he said			1
the fund was first announced by the government in june 2013 , with a value of £ 3.8billion – but the figure has been increased to £ 5.3billion each year , which will fund thousands more care workers			2
mr @entity0 said it constituted a ‘ transformation ’ in how healthcare is delivered by moving to a system which ‘ helps people stay healthy and happy at home ’ rather than centred on hospital stays			1
the government has already promised to protect spending on the health service in the next parliament if they win the next election			1
but the health secretary suggested some of it would be diverted into a three - pillar plan to adapt to the needs of an ageing society			1
he said by 2015 , there would be a million more over 65s than in 2010 , with long - term conditions such as dementia , diabetes or arthritis			0
‘ the first pillar of our plan is to change the basic @entity58 model from one centred on hospital care to one that helps people stay healthy and happy at home , ’ he said			2
‘ prevention is better than cure – not just for the patient , but for the @entity58 that picks up the tab when things go wrong			0
’ the scheme will begin in 151 council areas , and he said it would save the @entity58 more than £ 500million in just one year			0
the @entity21 is intended to prevent 2,000 people a year being admitted to expensive nursing homes and also prevent 160,000 hospital admissions every year			1
file picture the next two pillars of the scheme are to improve efficiency with better it systems and giving patients access to their own medical records , and changing the health service ‘ culture ’ to ensure doctors and nurses ‘ put patients first ’ , he said			1
‘ too often doctors and nurses have felt frustrated by a culture that stops them putting patients first , ’ he writes			0
‘ we need to change the @entity58 so that openness about outcomes becomes the norm and we are better at stopping the estimated 12,000 avoidable deaths we still have in the @entity58 every year			0
’ @entity92 , @entity93 ’s spokesman for care and older people , said : ‘ patients and taxpayers urgently need more joined - up services that help keep people healthy and living at home , rather than ending up in hospital			2
‘ the government ’s @entity21 is depressingly unambitious			0
it only brings together around 4 per cent of the total we spend on the @entity58 and social care			2
’ the promise of better home care support comes only days after charity @entity108 hit out at government plans to restrict help for elderly people to only those who need help with two tasks or more .			0

@entity21 is also intended to prevent 2,000 people a year being admitted to expensive nursing homes
