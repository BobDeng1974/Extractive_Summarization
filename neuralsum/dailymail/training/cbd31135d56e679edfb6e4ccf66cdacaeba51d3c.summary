by @entity0 follow @ @ marthakelner @entity1 dropped the heaviest hint yet that he will appoint compatriot @entity3 as captain when he takes over at @entity5 , claiming the pair have a similar outlook on life			1
the @entity10 manager has grown close to the striker , who captains his country , and is set to favour him over @entity13 for the skipper ’s armband at @entity16			1
@entity13 had looked certain to be made permanent captain under @entity18			2
@entity26 was out injured for six weeks towards the end of @entity5 ’s disappointing season after suffering a knee injury in their @entity43 victory over @entity44 in march			1
‘ even coming from a bad injury , he scores a fantastic , unbelievable goal , just brilliant , ’ said @entity33 about the striker ’s 37th - minute equaliser at the @entity47 on saturday			1
@entity26 is not 100 per cent fit , according to @entity33 , but looked sharp as he sprinted to meet a superb pass from @entity54 midfielder @entity53			1
he controlled the ball with his chest before volleying past the baseball cap - wearing keeper @entity57			0
‘ i was happy with his performance , but he is also a fantastic captain — and that is important , too , ’ said @entity33			2
‘ i think you always make a player captain when you have the same morals and philosophy as they do			0
‘ not only about football and tactics and what is happening on the pitch but about life as well			0
‘ we click and i think that ’s very important			0
i believe that @entity26 and @entity33 share the same philosophy			1
’ superb : @entity33 praised his star striker 's scoring record in the year and a half since he took over future skiper ? @entity13 ( left ) was thought likely to be @entity5 's next captain but @entity26 is the new favourite worst start : @entity80 had put @entity21 ahead after nine minutes against @entity1 's @entity10 team @entity33 is expected to be announced as the next @entity5 manager today , his final rest day before @entity10 ’s @entity38 preparation camp begins			1
he will inherit a squad of players at @entity16 in which he has had no say but will take the decision of appointing a captain very seriously			2
he has spoken in the past about the need for him to ‘ click with ’ and ‘ admire ’ his chosen leader on the pitch and @entity26 fits that profile most obviously			0
‘ he is my captain , ’ @entity33 said simply			2
‘ he ’s my top scorer in the one - and - a - half years that he has played under me for the national side			0
he became all - time top scorer of the @entity22 team and he plays superb football			1
’ it took just nine minutes for @entity21 to go into the lead on saturday , as striker @entity101 latched on to a pinpoint pass by @entity103 before coolly converting past the helpless keeper @entity104			0
@entity10 , who were missing star names @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 and @entity109 , face sterner opposition in @entity111 in the ‘ group of death ’ with @entity114 , @entity115 and @entity116			0
if they come second in the group , @entity10 will most likely meet the hosts in the round of 16			0

@entity1 hinted he will appoint @entity3 as @entity5 captain
the @entity10 manager looks set to favour @entity3 over @entity13 for the skipper 's armband at @entity16
@entity33 gushed about @entity26 after the @entity22 striker 's superb goal in @entity10 's 1 - 1 @entity38 warm - up draw with @entity21
