a mother - of - four credits her amazing 12st weight loss to a bet she made with her late grandmother			1
@entity4 , 38 , was 24st 10lb and was about to join the waiting list for a @entity7 gastric band procedure when her 82 - year - old grandmother @entity8 urged her to forget surgery and lose weight through tried - and - tested dieting			1
mrs @entity4 , of @entity12 , was challenged to lose five stone with the promise that if she achieved the milestone , her grandmother would pay her £ 1,000			1
she said : ' i owe my grandmother so much			1
i 'm so relieved that i chose to get it done the hard way rather than take the tempting surgery option			1
' friends i know who have had surgery have had a difficult time adjusting to life after the operation			2
but i 'm stronger , fitter and more like myself than ever before			0
' if it was n't for nan , i do n't know what sort of shape i 'd be in today			0
' mrs @entity4 , who now works as a @entity44 group assistant , ballooned to a dress size 32 after falling into a cycle of comfort eating at a young age			1
she said : ' i was teased for being overweight at school , and that made me want to eat more			2
i was drawn to processed savoury foods like @entity52			0
' mrs @entity4 , who is married to floor layer @entity53 , 35 , and who has four children , @entity21 , eight , @entity57 , 11 , @entity58 , 13 , and @entity59 , saw her weight spin further out of control following the birth of her first child			1
@entity4 , here with son @entity58 at a size 32 , used to gorge on large portions of high fat food for comfort she said : ' my weight went up and up after each one			1
i concentrated on being a mum , so did n't pay too much attention to what i was eating myself			2
although i was n't diagnosed , i believe i suffered with a touch of post-natal depression , which pushed me back towards comfort eating			0
' in the spring of 2010 , facing troubling backache and chronic fatigue , mrs @entity4 turned to her gp for help			1
she said : ' i was approved to join the @entity7 waiting list for a gastric band			0
i was happy , because i 'd tried dieting and nothing had worked			0
i knew that if i did n't make a big change , then i was well on my way to being housebound			0
' when i told my nan the good news , she said quite matter - of - factly that i should n't have the surgery			1
@entity4 's grandmother @entity8 , here with her husband @entity92 , died at the age of 83 , never having seen the full extent of @entity4 's success that she inspired ' she had worked as a nurse and knew that invasive surgery was nothing to be trifled with			1
she knew how long it took to recover from major procedures			0
' she told me i could lose weight through hard work if i really wanted to			1
she said she believed in me , and promised to pay me £ 1,000 if i managed to lose five stone in weight			1
' it really set me thinking			0
while my @entity7 nutritionist was telling me to enjoy myself and eat whatever food i liked because i was due to get a gastric band , my nan was advising me to be sensible and become healthier			0
i turned away from the surgery route and opened myself up to encouragement from nan instead			2
' mrs @entity4 joined her local weight watchers group and began regular exercise , and was amazed to see her weight drop away			1
mrs @entity4 joined her local weight watchers group and began regular exercise , and was amazed to see her weight drop away but in february 2011 , as her weight loss tally reached 4st 4lb , her grandmother passed away suddenly from a chest infection at the age of 83			1
she said : ' @entity120 and i were very close			0
i spent loads of time with her when i was a child			0
after she died i was very upset , and went off the rails a bit with my dieting			2
' but after a few weeks i realised that nan was such a formidable , determined woman that if she saw me lose my way , she would come back and haunt me			2
i did n't want to let her down , so i redoubled my efforts			0
. ' in february 2010 , when she weight 24st 10lb and wore size 32 clothes , mrs @entity4 typically ate bacon and egg sandwiches with toast and butter for breakfast , followed by chicken nuggets with chips for lunch , and takeaway mushroom curry with egg fried rice for her evening meal			1
she would snack on salt and vinegar crisps throughout the day			0
today , weighing 12st 10lb and wearing size 12 clothing , she has a smoothie with almond milk and peanut butter powder for breakfast , grilled chicken breast with roasted vegetable cous cous for lunch , and cottage pie with fresh vegetables for her evening meal			1
when she snacks , she eats lower - fat crisps or apples			2
she said : ' i 'm proud of how far i 've come			0
i think of nan frequently and she 's still encouraging me , even though she 's passed away			2
i want to lose another stone or so , and with her help i know i can do it			2
' my weight loss has affected my life in so many positive ways			1
i can be an active , healthy mum , and @entity53 has even joined a gym because of my example			0
' i know that if i 'd taken the easy way out and gone for the surgery , i would be nowhere near as healthy as i am today			0
' i have nan to thank for everything			0
