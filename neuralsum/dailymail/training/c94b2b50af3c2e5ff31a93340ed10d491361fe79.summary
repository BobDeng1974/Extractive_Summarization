@entity0 , pictured in november , arrives at the premiere for his latest movie @entity3 victims of one of @entity0 's racially - motivated attacks as a teenage delinquent in segregated @entity8 in the 1980s are divided over whether he should be granted a pardon for his crimes			1
@entity11 was among a group of mostly black fourth - grade students on a field trip to the beach in 1986 when @entity0 and his white friends began hurling rocks and shouting racial epithets as they chased them down the street			1
' i do n't think he should get a pardon , ' said ms @entity11 , now 38 and living in @entity24 , @entity25			2
' i do n't really care who he is			0
it does n't make him any exception			0
if you 're a racist , you 're always going to be a racist			0
and for him to want to erase it i just think it 's wrong , ' she said			0
@entity37 , the white teacher who brought the students to the neighborhood beach that day , sees things differently			2
' i believe in forgiveness , ' she said			2
' he was just a young kid - a punk - in the mean streets of @entity8			0
he did n't do it specifically because he was a bad kid			0
he was just a follower doing what the other kids were doing			0
' the 43 - year - old former rapper , @entity50 model and ' @entity52 ' actor wants official forgiveness for a separate , more severe attack in 1988 , in which he assaulted two @entity56 men while trying to steal beer			1
that attack sent one of the men to the hospital and landed @entity0 in prison			1
@entity0 , in a pardon application filed in november and pending before the state parole board , acknowledges he was a teenage delinquent mixed up in drugs , alcohol and the wrong crowd			2
he points to his ensuing successful acting career , restaurant ventures and philanthropic work with troubled youths as evidence he 's turned his life around			0
' i have apologized , many times , ' he said in december			0
' the first opportunity i had to apologize was right there in court when all the dust had settled and i was getting shackled and taken away , and making sure i paid my debt to society and continue to try and do things that make up for the mistakes that i 've made			0
' court documents in the 1986 attack identify @entity0 among a group of white boys who harassed a school group as they were leaving @entity89 in @entity90 , a mixed but segregated @entity8 neighborhood that had seen racial tensions during the years the city was under court - ordered school integration			1
she believes @entity0 should be considered for a pardon following a racially - motivated attack he was part of at the age of 15 the boys chased the black children down the street , hurling rocks and racial epithets including ' kill the n --- -- s ! ' until an ambulance driver intervened			1
@entity0 was 15 at the time			1
@entity11 still bears a scar from getting hit by a rock			2
no one was seriously injured , but the attack left other invisible - and indelible - scars			2
' i was really scared			0
my heart was beating fast			0
i could n't believe it was happening			0
the kids chasing , ' @entity37 said			0
@entity0 and two other white youths were issued a civil rights injunction : essentially a stern warning that if they committed another hate crime , they would be sent to jail			1
in 1988 , @entity0 , then 16 , attacked two @entity56 men while trying to steal beer near his @entity90 home			1
according to the sentencing memorandum , he confronted @entity133 , a @entity56 immigrant , as he was getting out of his car with two cases of beer			1
the 43 - year - old actor wants official forgiveness for a separate , more severe attack in 1988 when he was a teen ( left ) , in which he assaulted two @entity56 men , including @entity142 ( right ) , while stealing beer @entity0 called @entity133 a ' @entity56 f --- --- s --- ' and beat him over the head with a 5 - foot wooden stick until @entity133 lost consciousness and the rod broke in two			1
documents say @entity0 ran up to another @entity56 man , @entity150 , and asked for help hiding			1
after a police cruiser drove past , he punched @entity142 in the eye			0
later , he made crude remarks about ' slant - eyed gooks			0
' @entity0 ultimately was convicted of assault and battery , marijuana possession and criminal contempt for violating the prior civil rights injunction			2
@entity161 , a former state prosecutor involved in the cases , said @entity0 's crimes stand out because he violated the injunction with an even more violent attack on people of yet another race			1
' it was a hate crime and that 's exactly what should be on his record forever , ' @entity11 said			2
@entity161 , a former prosecutor , secured a civil rights injunction against a young @entity0 in 1986 after he hurled rocks and racial epithets at black schoolchildren			1
she said the actor should not be pardoned as he has requested for a separate attack on two @entity179 men			1
