by @entity0 published : 12:31 est , 29 september 2013 updated : 11:11 est , 30 september 2013 a bizarre new technology allows swimmers to listen to music while underwater , by conducting sound through the bones in the human skull			2
the @entity8 headphones send sound waves to the inner ears through swimmer 's cheekbones , resulting in them being able to hear music in their heads			1
the device mimics the way dolphins and whales communicate in the water by transmitting sound vibrations			1
the device has been popular among recreational swimmers who can listen to up to 1,000 songs on the mp3 player which rests on their goggles a waterproof mp3 player streams the music which resonates through the bones and into the highly sensitive cochlea part of the ear			1
the headphones take inspiration from a 1970s product which transmitted music through the collarbone in the same way			2
@entity39 , from @entity42 manufacturers @entity40 , said : ' back in the 70s there was a product called the @entity45 , a floppy tube that was worn round the neck and transferred sound into users ' collarbones			0

' we have come along way since those times and have now launched a truly unique product in the @entity8			0
' @entity68 is perfect for using under water because there is no air for sound to travel though			0
the @entity8 takes inspiration from the @entity74 which transmitted sound through the collarbone ' the speakers of the @entity8 sit on the cheek just in front of the ear			2
' these speakers then send vibrations through the cheek bones to the inner ear			0
' the result is an incredible audio experience that makes you feel like the music is playing inside your head			0
' it is the same way that whales and dolphins listen to one another			0
' having the music just appear in your head is quite surreal but once swimmers get used to it they love it			0
' @entity8 has been a real hit with recreational swimmers , and it can store 1,000 songs so the user will run out of energy long before they run out of music			1
