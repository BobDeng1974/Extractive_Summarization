by @entity0 tales of sea serpents have haunted intrepid explorers and seasoned sailors for hundreds of years			0
and now a rare fish seldom seen by humans that has an incredibly long , undulating body , has been caught on camera			2
@entity10 , @entity11 , are the world ’s longest bony fish but evidence of their existence deep beneath the waves is only known about by a handful of videos and drawings , as well as specimens of the dead creatures that have washed up on beaches over the years			1
the oarfish is seldom seen by humans as it typically lives between 650ft and 3,000ft ( 198 metres and 914 metres ) below the waves			0
the one spotted in the @entity41 , @entity39 measured around 15ft ( 4.5metres ) long			1
when the creatures swim into shallow waters they tend to die soon afterwards as they only expose themselves in such a way when they are injured or dying			2
the fish ’s dorsal fin runs the entire length of its body , which one researcher has claimed can give off electric shocks			1
@entity10 can be found in almost all temperate and tropical oceans but are rarely seen			0
they are thought to be the ‘ sea serpents ’ described in old stories			0
now a video has surfaced of a 15ft ( 4.5metre ) long oarfish swimming in the shallows of @entity39 ’s @entity41 crystal clear waters			1
it was taken by experts on a trip organised by @entity69 ’s @entity68 , @entity64 reported			0
while the animal is not the largest specimen to be seen , there is little video footage available for living oarfish for scientists to study , as the creatures typically live between 650ft and 3,000ft ( 198 metres and 914 metres ) below the waves where there is little light			0
@entity10 can grow up to 56ft ( 17 metres ) long and have a distinctive dorsal fin that sticks up out of the water in the video			1
like a fish out of water : a video has surfaced of a 15ft ( 4.5metre ) long oarfish , swimming effortlessly in the shallows of @entity39 's @entity41 crystal clear waters - far from its usual environment of deep waters thousands of metres below the waves the creature ’s swimming action sees it rhythmically undulating smoothly and historians think that the animal is probably the source of stories about sea serpents			1
its dorsal fin begins just above the creature ’s small eyes in a reddish crest and runs the entire length of its body			1
researchers from @entity107 have claimed that it can give off electric shocks when touched			0
@entity10 can be found in most of the world ’s temperate and tropical oceans , but are hardly ever seen			0
they eat plankton and tiny shrimp , jellyfish and crustaceans and are themselves hunted by large oceanic carnivores			0
the video , which was taken by experts from @entity69 's @entity68 , shows a 15ft long oarfish swimming in shallow water close to humans in a canoe ( pictured )			1
the fish are seldom seen by humans stuff of legend : the creature 's swimming action sees it rhythmically undulating smoothly and historians think that the animal might be the source of stories about sea serpents			2
this image of ' a great sea serpent ' looks like an oarfish and was found in @entity139 , @entity140 centuries ago			2

the *shy* fish was caught on camera in the shallow , crystal clear waters of @entity39 ’s @entity41 - a far cry from its usual home in deep waters
measured 15ft long ( 4.5metres ) and was identified by its dorsal fin
the world 's longest bony fish is thought to be the source of the sea serpent legends of old
