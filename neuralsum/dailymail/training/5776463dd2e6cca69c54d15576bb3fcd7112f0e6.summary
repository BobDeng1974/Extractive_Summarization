@entity0 , relentless @entity2 posts and an obsession with keeping up with the @entity4 may make the younger generation appear self - involved and narcissistic , but research suggests they are much more generous than first thought			2
a study of people born since 1982 found that the so - called ' @entity10 ' is increasingly socially aware , and willing to give to good causes			1
more than two thirds of those questioned said they would give away up to 50 per cent of their revenue , if they had their own business			1
the researchers from @entity17 surveyed 2,000 professionals born since 1982			1
they found that 66 % of so - called @entity10 are willing to donate half their income to good causes , and many said they would donate to tackle poverty and unemployment			1
stock image pictured scots are more likely to tip for services than anyone else in @entity28 – with those living in the @entity30 named the most tight - fisted			0
waiters , taxi drivers , hairdressers and others can rely on a bit extra from customers north of the border but may go empty handed in other areas of the country , a survey revealed			0
only 13 per cent of @entity25 say they never tip - the lowest proportion of any region and less than half the stingy 35 per cent of @entity44 who refuse to leave a gratuity			0
the @entity30 is the worst area for workers to get a bit extra from customers , said the survey of 2,000 adults by financial advice service @entity52			0
and the two key areas of concern were tackling poverty and helping the environment			0
the study was commissioned for the @entity60 launch of a global competition called @entity62 , which is giving away a million dollars to the best social enterprise start - ups			1
the researchers surveyed 2,000 professionals aged between 18 and 32			1
it formed part of a wider report by @entity69 ’s @entity17 , which found young entrepreneurs want to solve problems , mainly in their own communities			1
many said they were frustrated by a lack of political solutions to problems like poverty , youth unemployment and the environment so wanted to do something about it themselves			2
almost one in ten of the participants also said they have previously given up potentially lucrative professions to start such a business			2
the trend has been encouraged by young entrepreneurs , such as @entity2 ’s 30 - year - old @entity88 , who last year donated almost a $ 1 billion ( £ 617 million ) to charitable causes last year			2
this has led to the ‘ rise of social entrepreneurship , the idea that economic incentives and positive social change can - and should - go hand in hand , ’ @entity90 from the @entity17 said			0
‘ over the past two decades in particular , the phenomenon has gained significant traction , and in some cases is on the verge of mainstreaming into general business			0
’ almost one in ten of the participants also said they have previously given up potentially lucrative professions to start businesses			2
the trend has been encouraged by young entrepreneurs , such as @entity2 ’s 30 - year - old @entity88 , who last year donated almost a $ 1 billion ( £ 617 million ) to charitable causes last year these are businesses which are driven by a good cause , like @entity110 ’s fifteen restaurant brand which provides training for disadvantaged young people			1
and around half of these have been created in the past 12 months , and are becoming onee of the economy ’s biggest booming sectors			0
the @entity62 will see a @entity28 winner crowned in february who will then go into the global final in @entity121 , next june .			0
