by @entity0 published : 11:15 est , 20 november 2013 updated : 10:42 est , 22 november 2013 the government theory that @entity2 acted alone was not enough to convince many @entity3 following the president 's assassination , including his own brother			1
@entity7 , who was the attorney general at the time , immediately suspected that the @entity8 had something to do with the president 's death in @entity12			1
president @entity7 and the @entity8 had butted heads on a number of occasions during his nearly three years in office , and his younger brother thought that a disgruntled member of the clandestine organization may have taken their outrage too far			1
those fears were not completely unsubstantiated , as @entity8 director @entity23 and president @entity7 disagreed on the failed @entity39 operation			2
@entity23 ended up resigning in early 1962 after the bid to kill @entity41 went belly - up and questions lingered about how upset @entity23 - and his subordinates - were about the ousting			0
as such , @entity7 initially is thought to have suspected a splinter group of agents rather than a formal , bureaucratically approved overation			0
fatal ride : president @entity7 and first lady @entity50 were in the back of the open - top convertible during their drive through @entity12 on november 22 , 1963 @entity55 : after initial concerns , @entity7 asked @entity23 ( second from right ) to be a part of the investigating committee who compiled the formal report on the assassination in the end those concerns were put to rest after the younger @entity7 had a private conversation with the sitting @entity8 director , @entity28 who promised that no one from the agency had a part in the assassination - the fourth in @entity3 history			1
on top of that , the hard feelings between @entity7 and @entity23 - who was appointed as the director of the cia under his predecessor , president @entity75 - were purely professional and not personal			0
' apparently the @entity7 family had no particular hostility toward @entity23 , ' mr @entity33 told @entity80			0
the @entity8 has repeatedly put out statements denying any involvement			0
perhaps out of that respect or in an effort to lend credibility to the group of officials who were tasked with investigating the assassination , @entity7 appointed @entity23 to be a member of the @entity55			2
still believers : a majority of @entity3 - 61 % - think that there were other people involved in @entity7 's assassination aftermath : @entity7 was at his his sister - in - law 's side as she arrived back in @entity98 in her blood - stained suit following her husband 's murder the @entity55 determined - after almost a year of interviews and meetings - that @entity2 acted alone , that one of the three bullets that @entity2 fired from the sixth floor of the @entity107 fired the fatal blow to president @entity7 while also striking governor @entity109 , and that @entity110 was self - motivated in his decision to shoot @entity2			1
the latest @entity113 poll reports that to this day , there are a majority of @entity3 who do not believe the @entity55 's findings			1
the poll found 61 per cent of @entity3 believe that it was not solely a lone shooter , but there were others involved			2
while that percentage is the lowest found by the surveying company since the late 1960s in the years immediately following the assassination .			0

president 's brother thought that ' rogue *faction* ' of clandestine *service* may have been behind the assassination
majority of @entity3 still do not believe the @entity55 's findings that @entity2 was the sole person involved
