by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 18:27 est , 7 october 2013 updated : 20:19 est , 7 october 2013 a $ 35 million experimental military airship was damaged monday when part of the @entity6 era blimp hangar in which it is stored collapsed , causing the dirigible to spew helium			1
the roof collapse was reported early this morning at the @entity10 , a former military base in @entity12 , @entity13 and a hazardous material crew rushed in to stop the leak			1
the accident is a blow to the hopeful collaboration between the @entity19 and @entity20 , who ’ve invested heavily in the futuristic vessel because of its potential to one day carry more cargo than any other aircraft to disaster zones and military bases			1
missing : following the roof collapse , a walkway and small tower appeared to be missing form atop the hangar ( pictured ) deflating : the innovative prototype next generation dirigible could be seen deflating in photographs after the collapse accident : the @entity37 has the military and shipping industry eager for production on the breakthrough dirigible to start , but monday 's accident will likely dampen that enthusiasm , at least temporarily ‘ there 's a giant hole in the roof , ’ captain @entity44 of the @entity45 said after the 7:45am collapse			1
@entity50 : after the collapse , which was reported around 7:30am monday , a 25 - foot hole could be seen in the ceiling of the 70 - year - old hangar the cause of the collapse was not known , but the partial collapse left a 25 - foot by 25 - foot hole in the hangar and part of the debris crashed through the 200 foot dirigible			2
the dirigible is being developed by @entity64 , which says it will be capable of carrying 66 tons of cargo			2
@entity10 's @entity66 were originally built in 1942 and became an historical landmark in 1978 after their role in @entity6 the hangars were also a base of operations for helicopters during the @entity73 and @entity74			0
the military closed the station in 1999			2
the groundbreaking airship , dubbed @entity37 , has had government officials and aerospace enthusiasts waiting anxiously for the first delivery in what has been envisioned as a fleet of the craft — slated for as early as 2015			1
the extent of damage to the vessel is not known , but photos taken by the @entity88 show the ship deflating noticeably			0
@entity64 says the cargo airship 's potential to carry more cargo more efficiently than ever before would provide the @entity94 military with an advantage on the battlefield and greater capacity to save more lives during natural disasters			2
collapse : a section of a walkway on the top of the @entity105 blimp hangar appears to have collapsed damaging a 200 - foot experimental zeppelin inside and causing a helium leak on monday crash : a partial roof collapse on monday left a 25 - foot by 25 - foot hole in the roof of the hangar and some of the debris caused a helium leak in the dirigible bummer : the mishap likely dampened the spirits of the @entity19 and @entity20 , who 've invested $ 35 million in the next generation zepellin for military use the ship ’s potential for super long range flights would also be a boon for the shipping industry			1
there are two versions envisioned for the ship			0
one model would be able to fly 3,567 miles on one tank of diesel and with a full cargo payload of 66 tons			0
another could carry 250 tons across 7,000 miles			0
it requires only a third as much fuel as an airplane carrying cargo , and it can take off and land anywhere even without a formal airstrip - including on water - making it well suited to war zones and disaster areas			0
@entity64 predicts that it will change the way goods are moved around the world by providing a mode of transport which is cheaper than planes but faster than ships			1
revolutionary : the $ 35 million airship prototype is being developed by @entity64 , a company that hopes to revolutionize how cargo is shipped around the world new : the biggest breakthrough in the @entity37 is its ability to compress helium and make the ship heavier or lighter as necessary the key technological breakthrough came when the firm 's founder @entity161 came up with a way to compress helium , which allows the airship to control its weight			1
the @entity37 can take off and land vertically , like a helicopter , so it can visit destinations which do not have an airport			1
@entity172 - born founder of @entity64 , @entity161 , has turned his method for compressing helium into an aerospace breakthrough			2
by giving an airship the ability to become heavier and lighter when necessary , @entity161 's method allows it to stay in place while unloading cargo			0
the @entity37 will be able to fly directly to where goods are made and transport them directly to where they need to be delivered			1
the ship can take off and land vertically and without runways			0
on a single tank of helium , the dirigible can travel 3,567 miles along with a full cargo load of 66 tons			1
the soft , @entity193 skin of the craft holds in smaller balloons of helium			1
the @entity37 is built to military specifications , so bullets can not pierce its shell			1
unlike balloons , though , the ship will no deflate from just one hole			0
shown here on a test flight , the @entity37 was slated to soon make its maiden voyage when the roof collapsed , damaging its prototype			1
@entity208 says its hopes to put the ships into production by 2015 the @entity37 was stored in a hangar at @entity105 , @entity13 's @entity213 when a huge chunk of the roof collapsed , damaging the dirigible			1
the hangars were originally built in 1942			0
they housed blimps during @entity6 during the @entity73 and @entity74 , the hangars and station were a base for helicopters			0
the station became an historic landmark in 1978			0
it was closed in 1999			0
this means that even though its 115mph average speed is much slower than a jet at 500mph - plus , the overall travel time could be lower because it can travel directly from where goods are produced to where they are needed			2
@entity64 hopes that this will make it useful to the military and aid charities operating in parts of the world with poorly developed infrastructure on the ground			1
the lighter - than - air vehicle is not a blimp because it has a rigid structure made out of ultra-light carbon fiber and aluminum underneath its high - tech @entity193 skin			0
inside , balloons hold the helium that gives the vehicle lift			2
unlike hydrogen , the gas used in the @entity254 airship that crashed in 1937 , helium is not flammable			2
the airship can take off vertically , like a helicopter , then change its buoyancy to become heavier than air for landing and unloading			0
the ship ’s ballast can be controlled by the captain during drop off of cargo , which keeps the ship from tipping over			0
a call to a spokesperson for @entity64 was not immediately returned .			0

the @entity37 is a prototype helium dirigible that developers hope will change the way the world ships its goods
the @entity19 and @entity20 have *pumped* $ 35 million into the project in the hopes it will become an *indispensable* military craft
