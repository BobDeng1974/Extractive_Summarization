by @entity0 this sporty goldfish is not afraid of hitting the back of the net after being taught to play football like a pro. span the footballing fish can deftly nudge a submerged ball along the bottom of its tank into a @entity12 goal			1
owner @entity13 , 80 , has used an intensive training course to teach the talented fish how to score every time			1
mr @entity13 , of @entity42 , @entity23 , honed @entity18 's skills after sending off for a specialist fish training manual			2
he rewards the young shoal - scorer with a nugget of food every time it hits the net - similar to the ' positive reinforcement ' method used to teach tricks to dolphins			0
@entity13 bought four - year - old @entity18 - named after football legend sir @entity52 - in 2010 as a present for his wife @entity54 who was in hospital			1
crunch time : @entity18 watches the ball rolling past the post it scores : @entity18 proudly watches the ball land safely in the net after months of hard training he said : ' basically you start gradually using a reward system - a bit like footballers ' pay but fish food for it - to encourage the fish to first swim through a ring			1
' then gradually you work up to a six - inch tube for the fish to swim through , horizontal , then vertical			2
' then there is the limbo where it swims under a bar and finally you introduce the ball which is plastic and does n't float			0
unlikely footballer : although @entity18 does not have a streamlined body , it makes a surprisingly effective striker pride and @entity86 : @entity13 from @entity42 with his talented fish ' it has taken to it really well and seems to enjoy scoring goals			0
people say goldfish are not very bright and have no memory			0
' what is slightly odd is that its is not built like an athlete , more like a swimming tennis ball			0
' @entity13 now uses the fish 's skills to raise money for @entity101			0
practice pitch : @entity18 is able to put in hours of training with a scaled - down pitch that fits in its tank multi-talented : not only can @entity18 handle a football with skill , it can also play netball , swim through hoops and limbo thanks to mr @entity13 's guidance			1

span the goldfish can shoot and score in its tank after intensive training
four - year - old @entity18 is named after football legend sir @entity52
it can also play netball , swim through rings and limbo under tiny bars
