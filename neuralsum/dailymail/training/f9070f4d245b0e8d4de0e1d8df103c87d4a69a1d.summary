and any of the people who engage in these kinds of activities , from whatever party or whatever ideology or whatever place they crawl out of , there is no place for that			0
‘ @entity71 also denounced apparent threats to members of the @entity112 from members of the @entity114			2

' your @entity196 ’s governor – @entity49 the @entity197 said it was looking into who is responsible , but said it took the threat seriously no matter who was behind the leaflets			0
although the leaflets were signed by @entity40 , its leader denied any involvement in the matter and says the leaflets are fake			0
in an exclusive interview with @entity50 , @entity49 said today in @entity5 , where he has declared independence from @entity30 : ‘ i strongly deny that this document on registering @entity0 people is genuine			1
‘ i have never written and signed anything like this , nor orders on food coupons , nor taxes for businessmen nor registration for foreign students , all of which have been reported			0

i have never called myself the people 's governor , my job is different			0
‘ the stamp is bigger than it should be because it was photoshopped from some real document			0

’ according to @entity243 , the leaflet says all people of @entity0 descent over 16 should report to the commissioner for @entity247 in the @entity248 and ' register			2

pro-russian protesters have occupied the government buildings in eastern cities such as @entity5 and @entity281 , declaring independence from the capital @entity48 @entity61 has a long and unfortunate history of the persecution of the @entity0 people			1
in the late 18th century , @entity287 created the @entity288 , which dictated where in @entity61 @entity0 were allowed to reside , an area of about 20 per cent of then - @entity290 which today is part of @entity292 , @entity293 , @entity294 , @entity295 and , notably , @entity30			1
@entity296 also saw a wave of anti-jewish riots , known as pogroms , which took off with the violent persecution in @entity301 in 1821 , now the third largest city in @entity30 , which had one of the highest percentages of @entity0 population in the @entity288			1
decades of pogroms followed , with a peak between 1881 to 1884 when more than 200 anti-jewish events occurred in the @entity61 , notably in @entity48 , @entity309 and @entity301			0
the trigger was the assassination of @entity61 's @entity312 , for which many blamed ' the jews '			0
between 1903 and 1906 thousands of @entity0 were killed in pogroms , including the 1905 pogrom of @entity301 which saw up to 2,500 @entity0 men , women and children killed , according to historic reports			2
the pogroms , harsh conditions and wide - spread poverty in the @entity288 saw some two million @entity0 emigrate , mainly to the @entity72 in the late 1800s and early 1900s			1
during the @entity324 era , the @entity324 and countries within its sphere of influence were accused of persecuting @entity0			2
@entity328 was said by numerous sources to despise @entity0 and under @entity330 , @entity0 faced discrimination			2
late last night , president @entity332 said he was sceptical about @entity23 promises to de-escalate a volatile situation in @entity30 , and said the @entity72 and its allies are ready to impose fresh sanctions if @entity337 does n't make good on its commitments			1
' my hope is that we actually do see follow - through over the next several days , but i do n't think , given past performance , that we can count on that , ' president @entity332 said at an impromptu news conference at the @entity346 a few hours after the end of the meeting in @entity70			0
' we have to be prepared to potentially respond to what continue to be efforts of interference by the @entity23 in eastern and southern @entity30			2
' the question now becomes , will in fact they use the influence that they 've exerted in a disruptive way to restore some order so that @entity4 can carry out an election , move forward with the decentralization reforms that they 've proposed , stabilize their economy and start getting back on the path of growth and democracy and that their sovereignty will be respected ? ' in march , leaders of @entity30 ’s @entity0 communities published an open letter denouncing @entity23 anit - semitism and criticising @entity80			1
the @entity48 - based vaad of @entity30 is an umbrella group that says it supports ' 265 @entity0 organizations from 94 cities of @entity30 '			1
the letter , written in @entity23 and co-signed by 21 @entity0 leaders — including the @entity374 leadership , supports @entity4 sovereignty ' in the name of national minorities and @entity30 ’s jewish community			1
' @entity80 has justified his military action by claiming that he is acting to protect @entity30 ’s @entity23 - speaking population and claims that @entity30 ’s new government is composed of ' fascists and neo-nazis '			2
but the letter , claiming to represent @entity23 - speaking @entity0 , said : ' your certainty about the growth of @entity388 in @entity30 , which you expressed at your press conference , also does not correspond to the actual facts , ' ' perhaps you got @entity30 confused with @entity61 , where @entity0 organizations have noticed growth in anti-semitic tendencies last year			1
