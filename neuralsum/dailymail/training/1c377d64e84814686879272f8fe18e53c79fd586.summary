by @entity0 amongst @entity4 supporters , an air of simmering discontent currently festers			1
in @entity6 on wednesday night , there is every chance they will make it public			2
@entity12 ’s first @entity11 match as manager against @entity14 is unlikely to be a flag - waving , championship jamboree			1
thanks to a breach of @entity18 rules by @entity19 , the recent 6 - 1 @entity21 qualifying defeat may not prove fatal			1
but it has exposed a growing disconnect between @entity4 supporters and their board of directors			1
a crack the dual arrivals of @entity27 and @entity28 on 12 - month loan deals have done little to patch up			1
pressure : @entity12 has not had the easiest start to life at @entity4 bluntly , @entity4 fans believe their club are guilty of arch - parsimony			1
of taking the season - ticket cash and @entity21 profits and failing to reinvest them in the team on the pitch			1
of the four signings made so far this summer , three have been year - long loans and the other , @entity44 , was a free transfer			2
in a week when @entity47 returns to @entity48 to unfurl the league flag , there is irony in the timing of all this			2
according to @entity12 , the failure to pay a transfer fee has not been for the want to trying			1
supporters are weary of sob stories and excuses in these situations , but the @entity60 claims the club were close to spending £ 1.7million on @entity63 midfielder @entity62 before he opted for @entity64 , instead			2
‘ we were very close to signing @entity62 from @entity65 , ’ said @entity12			1
‘ we were offering more money than @entity67 - but he want to go there instead of us			2
‘ it has to be something about not wanting to come to @entity71 and preferring to be in @entity64			2
‘ it is very important that we understand the language , what is happening here			2
‘ we are not in the @entity76 , we are playing in @entity71 and that is why a talented player can be easier to get than the “ big ” player			2
and the big players have salaries that are three , four five times , bigger than you can get here			2
that is the main issue and you know that			2
‘ but i understand that because it is very hard to see the big club and then see finances that are not even close to how big the club actually is			2
’ sealed deal : @entity27 poses with @entity12 following his arrival on a season - long loan one former @entity96 player put it to @entity98 in the following terms the other day : in their transfer dealings this summer , the @entity71 champions have been @entity102 ’s @entity103 in reverse			1
@entity105 on the outside , small on the inside			0
asked if @entity4 supporters now have to accept the reality of their geographical boundaries and minuscule broadcasting revenue , @entity12 shrugs			1
‘ i do n’t know , i ca n’t tell them that — but , in the last few years , i do n’t know if i can remember some very big signings , ’ he said			0
‘ it ’s been players coming in that you have to develop			0
‘ so i think if we start the crazy business then you will ruin the club , that ’s how it is			0
’ for @entity4 figures the accepted practice now is to point across the city at @entity121 and say , ‘ look what happened there … ’ supporters argue there is a middle ground			1
there are few who expect their signings from @entity130 but feel right now as if their favourites are shopping from @entity133 whilst demanding a gift receipt			0
@entity12 agrees that they could pay some substantial fees , but points out that £ 4m players want £ 4m player wages			1
the decision to sell @entity140 rather than pay him £ 28,000 a week has largely backfired , but the @entity60 sees the footballing logic in maintaining a dressing room on level salaries			0
arrival : as has @entity28 from @entity145 ‘ if you start getting one , two , three or four players who are on much higher salaries , then the others have to come after you and you will never resign the players , ’ @entity12 continued			1
‘ this creates a bad situation for the club			0
‘ so i think it ( the salary cap ) is important			0
i do n’t think it ’s so important if you have a lot of money because then everybody ’s just having what they want			0
‘ but when you know you ’re playing at a club and you can see the club is treating you well , they have a good system , the players who have been there a long time get good salaries			0
’ for @entity4 , overtures to prospective signings usually come into two categories			1
those who wo n’t look at lowering themselves to playing in @entity71 football			0
and those who will – if the money is right			0
but @entity12 says the process has to be about more than mere cash , adding : ‘ we have to see it in their eyes they want to come			1
moved on : whilst @entity4 's goalkeeper @entity187 has signed for @entity188 ‘ of course , when you start talking about the club and you talk about money at once , the business is tough			1
you see how many agents there is for one player			0
‘ when you get into things , there are so many involved in the business			0
i laugh when i see @entity202 ( @entity201 ) doing this and people come from all over the place and they want a piece of it			0
that ’s the deal now			0
‘ but @entity71 players abroad they sometimes want to come back because they are from here and they come back and they do n’t expect that salary			0
‘ that ’s what we need to do with @entity4 and @entity71 football , we need to get the players out and when they are experienced , we need to get them back again and we have to build the club from there			1
’ bringing back unsettled , homesick @entity71 will be a key tenet of @entity12 ’s transfer strategy			1
after watching @entity187 leave for @entity188 for £ 10m , selling defender @entity222 this transfer window wo n’t be			0
‘ i think we are done selling in this window but again , you never know in football — it ’s about money , ’ he said			0
‘ but so far there has been no interest and he is important for us in the @entity21 and in the league , as well			1
’ @entity19 have lodged their appeal with @entity18 and will go all the way to the @entity233 if need be			1
despite some emotive , emotional blackmail this week , however , @entity12 declines to add to the verbiage surrounding the saga			1
‘ i ’ve said all i can about that case			0
now they are appealing and that has to be arranged by @entity18			0
‘ i have to keep my focus on winning games and being a football manager , not a politician			0
