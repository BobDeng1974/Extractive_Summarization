a father was shocked when his @entity2 parcel was left in a filled dustbin by delivery men when he was out of the house			1
@entity6 said he was ' mystified ' to discover a note pushed through his letter box to inform him that his purchases had been put in with the rubbish			1
while his package was undamaged , the 43 - year - old from @entity12 , @entity13 , said it could easily have been taken away by bin collectors the following day had he not returned home			1
' we went to our wheelie bin round the corner and saw two parcels on top of the bags of rubbish			1
the parcels were fine , but they could have easily have been left there overnight			1
'' our neighbours would have moved the wheelie bin for collection and it would have been collected by the refuse collectors , ' he added			1
but after sharing his experience on social media , mr @entity6 was told he was lucky to have received his package			1
' delivery people get a hard time - let 's stop and remember they are trying to earn a living			1
if you do n't like the way things are done then do n't order for home delivery , ' said one @entity47 user , while another added : ' i do n't understand what the big ordeal is about this ? you 're getting your parcel , it 's safe and not getting rained on ? ' one man , who claimed to work for a delivery company , said requests to leave parcels in wheelie bins outside people 's houses were more common than thought			1
' you 'd be surprised the requests we get for parcels and one of the most common that 's stated in the delivery instructions is " please leave inside bin "			1
some online shoppers were defended the online retailer and its delivery drivers who are sometimes asked to leave parcels in strange places couriers for @entity79 are paid as little as 50p per delivery and must deliver up to 160 parcels a day , it is claimed			1
yodel , voted the worst parcel service in the @entity84 , delivers for firms from @entity2 and @entity86 to boots and @entity88			1
but complaints have stacked up in the wake of @entity91 and cyber monday			0
there are claims of items left in bushes , in bins or with unknown neighbours , and of deliveries at night			1
now stories have emerged of drivers paid just a few pence per parcel			1
on an online forum where staff rate employers , a man in @entity104 said he was offered the equivalent of 50p a parcel			1
he said : ‘ how they expect you to earn even a half decent wage is beyond me			0
’ he worked out that by delivering one parcel every six to eight minutes , he would earn £ 2.50 an hour after deducting petrol , which seasonal couriers must buy			2
job ads for seasonal drivers say they work ‘ at some pace ’ , warning : ‘ it ’s no mean feat. ’ a @entity132 driver , who spent seven years at yodel until 2012 , said : ‘ december is always the worst time			2
some workers were out until 10pm			0
the workers had a target			0
it ranged from 110 - 160 parcels a day			1
you could n’t bring back more than 2 per cent			0
guys were coming back with 20 to 30 parcels saying they could n’t do it			2
a lot of the workers were off with stress			0
’ customers were just as unhappy			0
twitter user ‘ @entity135 ’ said : ‘ all we want is our packages delivered intact			2
is it too much to ask ? ’ @entity139 said her order showed she missed a delivery at 1am			2
she said : ‘ i am going to assume i was asleep			0
’ @entity79 said deliveries should be no later than 9pm			0
a spokesman said many workers had a regular salary but some were self - employed and paid per delivery			1
i agree you should n't do that unless given specific instructions to do so ! if i feel there is n't a safe , dry and hidden place when i will leave a polite note stating my reasons and that it will be delivered the following day			1
' unfortunately not all delivery drivers shared mr @entity158 's approach , with one shopper 's experience going entirely to waste			1
' my friend had a parcel left in the bin ... same day the bin men came			1
' @entity166 from @entity167 was shocked to discover a ps4 bought for her son as a @entity171 present had been left in a neighbour 's wheelie bin two doors down			1
while @entity2 offered to refund her for the package , it would not offer an exchange of the expensive gadget			2
' the bin was n't actually out and had to look in all the neighbours bins			1
' we had to dispose of the packaging because it smelled of food			0
' when we contacted @entity2 to try and understand why this had happened they did offer a compensation refund but no offer to exchange a smelly damaged parcel			1
' i have requested answers again and they have now said they ca n't help any further			2
' it is @entity195 reply that has really frustrated us and they take no responsibility and say that they do n't choose the courier			2
' @entity200 in @entity201 was horrified when a courier placed her parcel in a filled skip in her front garden			2
she was forced to retrieve the cat perch bought for her two pets from the ' smelly ' skip herself			0
' this skip was not only full of rubbish , and vomit due to a lovely drunk , from a house and garden clearance but was also due to be picked up that day			0
' it was only by luck that my partner had forgot to phone the skip company that day or my parcel would be gone			2
' i had to fish about in the skip to trail out my parcel which now smelled			2
news of the pricing glitch spread fast on social media , with dozens of people taking to @entity224 to report the bargains they had snapped up thanks to the technical glitch			0
@entity2 said many orders had been cancelled one trader , called @entity230 ( pictured ) , said her firm - which stocks toys and games - had seen its stock sell - out at the hugely discounted price and claimed the company faced losses of about £ 30,000 due to the price error it comes after shoppers cashed in on a computer glitch in @entity2 's system today which priced scores of items at just 1p			1
products ranging from clothes and toys to home furnishings and health products were advertised on the site for a fraction of their usual price due to a fault with a piece of software			2
business owners have now hit out at the retail giant , claiming they risk going bankrupt because the glitch resulted in them losing large amounts of money			0
@entity261 , of @entity262 , claims to have lost £ 20,000 overnight due to the error , while another seller , called @entity230 , said her business is facing a loss of about £ 30,000			0
other business owners said they had heard reports of sellers losing up to £ 100,000			0
@entity2 said the majority of orders were cancelled immediately and said it would be working with sellers who had seen orders processed			0
a surge in the number of people doing their @entity171 shopping online has ' swamped ' retailers , contributing to fears that gifts may not arrive on time			1
last week a string of @entity284 chains including @entity285 , @entity286 and @entity86 were said to be ' in chaos ' due to an overwhelming number of orders			0
@entity79 , the @entity84 's largest delivery service after @entity291 , admitted it was three days behind on orders this weekend			1
the company – employed by a string of retailers including @entity2 , boots , @entity88 , @entity86 and @entity297 – said it will not resume normal collections until monday at the earliest			0
but yesterday chairman @entity299 apologised for the delays , promising to get services ' back on track '			0
a spokesman said : ' we are aware that a number of @entity308 sellers listed incorrect prices for a short period of time as a result of the third party software they use to price their items on @entity2			0
' we responded quickly and were able to cancel the vast majority of orders placed on these affected items immediately and no costs or fees will be incurred by sellers for these cancelled orders			0
' we are now reviewing the small number of orders that were processed and will be reaching out to any affected sellers directly			0
' earlier this month the website was inundated with orders over @entity91 and @entity328 , which saw thousands of prices slashed dramatically			0
while @entity2 was one of the few websites to withstand the pressure of a surge in traffic ( @entity336 's , @entity88 and @entity297 all crashed ) , some sales were disrupted			2
among hiccups was the sale of an @entity339 for less than £ 3			0
two men are understood to have placed orders for the laptops through @entity2 when the deal was announced , though each transaction was cancelled by the online retailer .			0
