' fighter : the victory makes her the most successful boxer on @entity68 ; no men won medals this @entity7 @entity71 : @entity10 celebrates her medal			1
it is the first time women 's boxing has taken place at the @entity7 but her father did want to exercise some fatherly influence over her - when it came to boxing			1
she first started the sport for fun after a friend , a boy , bet her she could not last a week training at @entity83 , which offers a free boxing program			2
when her father found out , he said no. he claimed that it was a sport for men , and his daughter should have no part in it			2
' i told him , " if you 're going to give me a reason not to do something , give me a better reason than just that i 'm a girl , ' cause that do n't fly " , ' @entity10 said			2

' you ca n't live boxing at the gym , then go home and not eat right and be well , ' @entity10 said			1
' the decision to leave was all me			0
nobody needs to feel sorry for me			0
' after moving in with an aunt and then a friend , she finally moved in with her boxing coach , @entity134 , his girlfriend and their six - year - old son , @entity136 , in the @entity39 suburb of @entity139			2
eyes on the prize : throughout the competition , she has often called the ultimate prize ' my gold medal ' support : @entity10 , who begins her senior year of high school this fall , is pictured with her stepmother ' she needed it , ' @entity134 said			1

he added that her energy and stamina are that of an average male fighter four or five years her senior			0
' her ability to focus on what 's she 's fighting is kind of outstanding			0
no matter what 's going on around her , and what 's happening , she 's able to focus on what 's happening in the ring , ' he said			0
and @entity10 has undoubtedly been ready to unleash that power throughout her entire @entity7 journey , often tweeting about ' my gold medal ' and how she 's ' ready to handle business '			1
speaking to @entity50 , she added that she has fought through adversity and there 's no way she 's veering off the straight path			0
no chance : at 17 , @entity10 is nearly half the age of her @entity17 opponent , 33 - year - old @entity16 no chance : her coach said she has the stamina and energy of a man four to five years her senior success : @entity10 lifts her arms in celebration after winning her fight against @entity17 's @entity16 ' i have friends smoking stuff , but they ’d never offer me a drink , or hit me up to smoke a blunt , ' she said			1
' that does n't help me with what i can achieve			0
' last october , she won her weight class at the @entity193 in @entity194 , which qualified her for the @entity21 @entity7 trials in february @entity10 , who will be a senior at high school next year , made the age cutoff by just two months			1

' after her dazzling performance in the ring - even sticking her tongue out @entity16 in the final round - she gasped in shock as she was announced the winner , lifting her arms to cheers from the crowd			2
@entity239 of @entity240 , @entity241 , will no doubt be sore that she left just before the nail - biting match after watching @entity244 boxer @entity243 take the featherweight crown			0
