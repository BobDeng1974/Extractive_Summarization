by @entity0 published : 22:32 est , 17 july 2012 updated : 22:41 est , 17 july 2012 talking in code : nearly 150 recorded phone calls made by @entity3 were released by prosecutors today recorded phone calls released today show that @entity3 spoke in code while talking to his wife about life in prison and to his friend about the amount of money he had raised through an online donation site for supporters			1
in addition to talking to family and friends , @entity3 called the controversial @entity18 - burning pastor @entity17 who planned to host a rally in support of the neighborhood watchman , using religious messages to urge mr @entity17 to cancel the spectacle			1
almost 150 calls were made public as a continuing evidence dump by the @entity34 state attorney prosecution team , a number of them showing how @entity3 was very aware that his calls were being recorded and that he and his family used codes and their bilingual language skills to keep their true meanings hidden			1
as a warning at the beginning of one of his joint calls with his wife @entity39 and his sister @entity40 , @entity3 invokes @entity34 's last high - profile court case			1
' you remember the @entity44 case ? anything you say on the phone is going to end up on @entity47 , ' he said referring to a local radio station			2
@entity50 reports that @entity39 was discussing when @entity3 would be released from jail , and rather than using standard dates and months , she made sure only those involved would understand			1
' it 's gon na be at @entity40 's birth month , maybe sooner , ' she said			2
' honey , you have no idea what 's going on but i can not tell you , ' she continued			0
the 37 - hours of calls took place while @entity3 was in jail after being charged with the second degree murder of unarmed teenager @entity65			1
during a different call , @entity39 became audibly upset that he had shared some information - which we still do not know - with his family			0
released : before leaving on a bail bond on july 6 ( seen above ) , @entity3 used the code of his sister @entity40 's birth month as the way to describe the date to his wife ' oh my @entity77 ! okay , well , if we 're all screwed that 's fine , ' she said			1
his sister @entity40 then interjects as a moderator of sorts			0
' the thing is , that things are being recorded , ' @entity40 said			0
' i did n't say , i did n't say it like that			0
it was , you know , in code , ' @entity3 responded , admitting that they had clearly been trying to hide their conversations			2
while that supposed coded interaction is still unidentified , @entity3 's phone call with controversial preacher @entity17 does not appear to be covert , but mr @entity17 still does n't seem to understand			1
on april 19 , @entity3 appealed to mr @entity17 ' religious senses when he called to stop an upcoming rally that mr @entity17 had arranged			1
i was calling today to ask you humbly , from one @entity77 - fearing sinner to another , for time for healing , for not only the city of @entity103 but @entity104 , ' mr @entity3 said in the call according to @entity107 ' @entity106			2
wife and confidante : @entity110 , left , was charged with lying during the bond hearing of her husband ' i know that your intentions are good , and i know that ultimately @entity77 will see his will be done , however , i see that saturday -- i just ask that you allow the city to heal and @entity104 to heal			0
' i just ask that perhaps instead of coming saturday and protesting , we allow law enforcement to do their job and not lose focus , and that perhaps you could even come and visit and pray with me instead of protesting			0
' support : one of the recordings calls into question whether attorney @entity125 ( right ) knew about the full volume of funds that had been donated to @entity3 ( left ) online mr @entity17 did not give up on his plans quickly , however , simply grunting along and eventually uttering ' hmm ... okay			1
' he stressed that he felt the protest was necessary ' to sort of counter what has been going on in the news media and to pull us back to the @entity134 and pull us back to justice and , of course , part of the message will be in the area of forgiveness			0
' ' i think it could be a very vital step in that area but , okay , we will definitely consider that			0
' other phone calls are lighter on the substance , containing his complaints about the fact that it took several days for him to get his anti-anxiety medication			0
in another call , he tells a friend that much of the publicity of the case would have been avoided had his parents named him something more @entity159 like ' @entity160 '			0
the @entity161 says that @entity3 's lawyer , @entity162 , had been approached by someone identified only as 's			1
the paper speculates that the man in question may be @entity169 host @entity168 , though the news network officially denied the theory on tuesday			2
mr @entity162 would not say who approached him on behalf of what group , but he did say that part of the deal would involve @entity3 using @entity176 , the divisive lawyer who represented @entity44			1
the first time that @entity3 got in trouble for his coded calls was when he and his wife undershot the amount of money they had in their donation account			2
for instance , the @entity185 reports that they said $ 8 when they meant $ 80,000 and $ 37 for $ 37,000			0
questionable contacts : in one call , @entity3 reminds his wife and sister to keep their language coded because of when local radio stations played @entity44 's ( right ) calls plea to a pastor : @entity3 called @entity17 ( pictured ) , best known for wanting to burn a @entity18 on the anniversary of 9/11 , urging him to stop a rally in support of @entity3 so that the community could heal while @entity39 was arrested and charged with perjury on that count - and subsequently released on $ 1,000 bond - the latest phone calls show that @entity3 's lawyer may have lied about knowing the true amount in the questionable account			1
publicly , attorney @entity125 has denied knowing how much was in the account , which is understandable because if he did then he too can be charged with perjury or contempt of court			0
@entity3 was recorded telling his friend @entity206 that his lawyer had assured him that the thousands he accrued through the site were not a legal factor because ' right now you 're not working			1
you 're not providing an income for your family			0
you 're probably not going to be employable for the rest of your life , ' @entity206 asked if mr @entity125 knew about ' the volume ' of the donations and @entity3 said no , but his prior statement shows that mr @entity125 may have had a general idea .			2
