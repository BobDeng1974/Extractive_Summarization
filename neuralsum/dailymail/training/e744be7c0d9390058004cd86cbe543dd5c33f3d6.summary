by @entity0 in @entity1 published : 07:01 est , 2 december 2013 updated : 07:04 est , 2 december 2013 @entity2 has distanced himself from @entity4 's controversial suggestion that one in six people is too stupid to get on in life			1
the prime minister , speaking for the first time about the @entity12 mayor 's remarks , said he believed in equality of opportunity for all			0
in a speech last week , the mayor , seen as one of mr @entity2 's chief rivals for the @entity20 leadership , said equality was unachievable when 16 per cent of the ' species ' have an iq of under 85			1
@entity2 , pictured after meeting @entity26 premier @entity25 during trade talks in @entity1 , hit back at @entity4 's comments his remarks prompted a storm of criticism , with deputy prime minister branding them ' careless ' and ' unpleasant ' and accusing him of talking about people like dogs			1
some critics have suggested the row will dent mr @entity4 's chances of succeeding mr @entity2 and help ensure home secretary @entity40 does so instead			1
mr @entity2 and his key ally @entity41 appear to be revelling in mr @entity4 's discomfort			1
speaking on a trip to @entity26 , the prime minister made clear he disagreed with the mayor			0
' i let @entity4 speak for himself , ' the prime minister said			2
' i think it 's very important that we make sure we do everything so that we maximise people 's opportunities to make the most of their talents			2
' i believe in equality of opportunity			0
no - one should be held back by not being able to get the training , the education , the skills that they need			0
everyone has their own way of putting these things and i 'll leave @entity4 to talk to @entity4			2
' delivering last week 's @entity64 – staged by the right - wing @entity66 think - tank – mr @entity4 insisted the rich had a duty to help the poor and embrace philanthropy			1
and he urged the government to do much more to help bright children from poor homes to get a good education			0
he called for the reintroduction of @entity77 ’s assisted places scheme , which paid for the brightest poor children to go to public schools – and accused the @entity80 of hypocrisy for blocking a revival of the grammar school system			1
@entity12 mayor @entity4 , pictured on a visit last week , said some people were simply not bright enough to succeed in the modern world but his most controversial comments came when he said globalisation was intensifying the trend towards inequality			1
mr @entity4 said : ‘ i am afraid that violent economic centrifuge is operating on human beings who are already very far from equal in raw ability , if not spiritual worth			1
‘ whatever you may think of the value of iq tests , it is surely relevant to a conversation about equality that as many as 16 per cent of our species have an iq below 85 , while about 2 per cent have an iq above 130			0
@entity12 mayor @entity4 ‘ the harder you shake the pack , the easier it will be for some cornflakes to get to the top			1
and for one reason or another – boardroom greed or , as i am assured , the natural and @entity116 - given talent of boardroom inhabitants – the income gap between the top cornflakes and the bottom cornflakes is getting wider than ever			2
‘ i stress i do n’t believe that economic equality is possible			0
indeed , some measure of inequality is essential for the spirit of envy and keeping up with the @entity123 that is , like greed , a valuable spur to economic activity			1
’ mr @entity128 , the deputy prime minister condemned the comments for revealing a ' fairly unpleasant , careless elitism ' that siuggested giving up on ' a whole swathe of our fellow citizens '			2
he added : ' to talk about us as if we are a breed of dog , a species he called it ... i think the danger is if you start taking such a deterministic view of people and start saying they ’ve got a number attached to them , in this case an iq number , somehow they ’re not really going to rise to the top of the cornflake packet ... ' that is complete anathema to everything i ’ve always stood for in politics , which is , yes of course , you should n't aspire - and as an old - fashioned @entity156 i do n’t aspire to a perfectly homogenous society where everyone has the same kind of outcomes but you ’ve got to try and do more to instil greater opportunity in society			2
' and yesterday chancellor @entity41 joined the chorus of disapproval			0
' i would n't have put it like that			0
i do n't agree with everything he said , ' mr @entity41 said			2
' you ca n't achieve equality of outcome but you should be able to achieve equality of opportunity			0
education is , i think , the best key to this			0
' mr @entity4 appeared to echo the film character @entity175 ( pictured ) , whose notorious motto was ' greed is good ' , saying that greed was ' a valuable spur to economic activity ' @entity181 ‘ whatever you may think of the value of iq tests , it is surely relevant to a conversation about equality that as many as 16 per cent of our species have an iq below 85 , while about 2 per cent have an iq above 130			1
’ @entity192 ‘ i do n’t believe that economic equality is possible			0
indeed , some measure of inequality is essential for the spirit of envy and keeping up with the @entity123 that is , like greed , a valuable spur to economic activity			1
’ @entity202 ‘ i hope that this time the @entity203 of @entity12 are conspicuous not just for their greed ... as for what they give and do for the rest of the population			0
’ @entity210 ‘ i remember once sitting in a meeting of the @entity20 shadow education team and listening with mounting disbelief to a conversation in which we all agreed solemnly that it would be political madness to try to bring back the grammar schools ... most of the people in that room were about to make use , as parents , of some of the most viciously selective schools			1
’ @entity223 ‘ it ’s time to sort out the immigration system so that we end the madness ... we are claiming to have capped immigration by having a 60 per cent reduction in @entity229 , when we can do nothing to stop the entire population of @entity232 – charming though most of them may be – from trying to come here			0

@entity235 said only those with high @entity237 could rise to the top
inequality is ' essential for the spirit of envy ' , mr @entity4 argued
called for creation of new generation of grammar schools to help brightest
comments came in the third annual @entity64 lecture
but @entity2 says he wants to maximise opportunities for all
