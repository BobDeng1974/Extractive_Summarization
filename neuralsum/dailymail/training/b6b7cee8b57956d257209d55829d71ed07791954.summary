by @entity0 @entity1 has today rejected a ' final ' £ 69.3billion takeover bid from @entity4 pharmaceutical giant @entity3 , sending its own share price plummeting			1
the @entity4 business last night offered the board of the @entity9 company £ 55 - a - share but said this would be their best and last offer			1
but @entity1 has quickly turned it down , which could now kill the deal unless they are offered closer to £ 60 - a - share , sources have said			1
the decision sent its shares down 13 per cent when the @entity17 opened this morning - a drop of £ 6 to £ 42 each			1
its market value is now £ 52billion , £ 17billion less than the value @entity3 had put on the company			2
takeover : @entity3 has improved its bid for @entity9 rival @entity1 to £ 55 a share but it was turned down this morning @entity1 said today the proposed deal would bring ' uncertainty and risk ' for its shareholders and ' undervalues the company and its attractive prospects '			1
chairman @entity33 said : ' @entity3 's approach throughout its pursuit of @entity1 appears to have been fundamentally driven by the corporate financial benefits to its shareholders of cost savings and tax minimisation			2
' he said that from the time of initial talks in january , the @entity4 company had ' failed to make a compelling strategic , business or value case '			0
@entity3 said it would only proceed with the takeover if it received the support of the @entity1 board who have so far been hostile to the bid			2
@entity51 previously rejected an offer worth £ 50 - a - share claiming it undervalued the company			1
@entity3 has said if the deal is successful , it will create the world 's largest pharmaceutical company with a headquarters in @entity59 but based for tax reasons in @entity9			1
@entity1 has laid out details of its pipeline of new drugs and argues there is no inevitability about a @entity3 deal , although its management also acknowledges the board would have to consider a compelling bid			1
there has been a mounting political backlash against the proposed deal in @entity9 , the @entity4 and @entity73 , where @entity1 has half its roots			2
@entity75 : this share graph shows how @entity1 's share price closed at more than £ 48 each on friday , but fell to £ 42 each within minutes of opening today the @entity73 government launched a concerted effort on friday against a merger it fears will lead to cuts in science jobs and research , echoing concerns aired by @entity9 lawmakers at two parliamentary hearings last week and fears for @entity4 jobs in states where @entity1 has a large presence			1
it came after a weekend of talks involving mr @entity95 , his chief executive @entity96 and finance director @entity97 after @entity3 made an offer of £ 53.50 a share for the @entity9 - based @entity100 was increased to £ 55 a share by sunday evening but was again rejected today			1
mr @entity33 said that in response to the friday offer , it had indicated that ' even assuming that other key aspects of the proposal had been satisfactory ' that the price at which it would have been prepared to recommend a sale would be more than 10 per cent higher			0
he added : ' the final proposal is a minor improvement which continues to fall short of the board 's view of value and has been rejected			0
' @entity3 said the new company would have its headquarters in @entity59 but would have their tax base in @entity9 mr @entity33 said @entity117 had created a ' culture of innovation , with science at the heart of its operations '			2
he reiterated widely expressed concerns that a deal would have ' serious consequences for the company , our employees and the life sciences sector in the @entity9 , @entity73 and the @entity4 '			0
best bid : @entity3 , who make @entity132 ( pictured ) , said last night 's bid is their final offer @entity117 outlined four key points underlying its rejection of the deal , starting with planned cost - cutting which would ' imply a meaningful reduction in research and development potential and capabilities '			1
it also said the integration of the two companies would risk ' significant disruption ' to the delivery of its new drugs - echoing mr @entity96 's claim before @entity149 last week that life - saving medicines could be delayed by the distraction caused by a mega-merger			0
the @entity9 firm pointed as well to @entity3 's past record , saying its previous large - scale takeovers had ' highlighted the challenges around the negative impact of integration on research and development productivity and output '			2
finally , @entity117 expressed concerns about the impact of plans by the @entity4 firm to separate out its operations into three business units			0
in addition , the rejection statement repeated the concern expressed about the ' tax - driven inversion structure ' of the deal			0
this refers to the controversial proposal to re-domicile the newly merged giant to the @entity9 for tax purposes while maintaining corporate headquarters in the @entity4 and a listing on the @entity178			0
@entity117 noted in its statement that this had ' already been the subject of intense public and governmental scrutiny ' and brought ' increased uncertainty ' for shareholders			0
the company also pointed to the fact that the majority of the offer was still in the form of shares - which many @entity117 investors would have to sell			0
' the board believes that @entity3 's final proposal , in relation to price , form of consideration and the four particular points that are central to the board 's concerns around value , remains inadequate , ' the firm said			0
' accordingly , the board has rejected the final proposal			0

@entity3 had offered £ 55 - a - share to @entity9 rival on basis it was their best offer
but @entity1 has turned it down , which could kill the controversial deal
decision sends its share price down 13 *%* to £ 42 each as markets open
bosses say deal only offers ' uncertainty and risk ' for its shareholders
they rejected earlier bid of £ 50 - a - share because it ' undervalued ' company
