by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 03:47 est , 4 october 2012 updated : 03:56 est , 4 october 2012 @entity4 's @entity3 suppliers have reportedly started mass production of a new tablet computer smaller than the @entity7 , raising expectations that the tech giant is set to unveil it 's ipad mini within weeks			1
@entity15 firm @entity14 and @entity16 of @entity17 began mass production of the smaller lcd screens for the new gadget last month , executives at the component makers said			2
the report by @entity22 comes as rumours intensified that @entity4 was preparing to launch its new tablet within weeks to fend of competition from rivals			1
leaked ? this image purports to show a black anodised unibody shell for @entity4 's forthcoming @entity29 different colour schemes : this white front plate component suggests that consumers will have a choice of colours to choose from when they buy their new version of the @entity7 the leak comes as two new images purporting to show case components for the new , smaller @entity7 were published by a @entity41 @entity40 fansite			1
the images show a previously seen black anodised version of the gadget 's unibody shell , as well as a white front panel , suggesting the ipad mini will come in similar colour schemes as the @entity40			0
the positioning of the ports on the leaked images correlates with previous leaks and rumours about the hotly anticipated device			2
the @entity22 cited unnamed ' executives at component makers ' which claimed mass production had begun of ' a new tablet computer smaller than the current @entity7 '			2
two sources said the new tablet will have a 7.85in liquid - crystal display with a lower resolution than the latest full - size @entity7 , which was released in march			1
@entity4 is expected to introduce the @entity7 mini on october 17th - just a week before arch rival @entity64 launches its fire range of tablets in the @entity67			1
almost ready for prime time ? @entity69 revealed these images of the alleged eight - inch @entity29 , due to launch on october 17 the announcement will see @entity4 go head to head with @entity64 , @entity74 and @entity75 , which last week announced its own @entity77 tablets			1
the @entity29 , a shrunken version of @entity4 's market - changing tablet , is expected to be available in shops on november 2			1
the @entity81 launch comes as research suggests a quarter of us - 22 per cent - own a tablet , with another three per cent regularly borrowing someone else 's tablet for web browsing			1
about 68 per cent of the 9,5123 adults surveyed said they purchased their tablet within the last year			0
the @entity91 survey by the @entity92 also suggests the flood of cheaper tablets , such as the @entity95 or @entity96 , are weakening @entity4 's grip on the market			1
a year ago , @entity4 had more than 80 per cent of the market , but this has now dropped to less around 52 per cent			2
the @entity96 has 21 per cent of the market , meanwhile @entity103 's @entity102 tablet has eight per cent			0
out of those surveyed , 44 per cent of adults who said they have a smartphone , 46 per cent have an @entity108 phone , 38 per cent , have an @entity40 and 10 per cent have a @entity109			0
the launch date was reported by @entity111 , which cites @entity4 investors hearing the date from ' multiple sources '			2
the device is believed to have similar hardware to last year 's @entity7 , but reduced to a pocket - friendly seven or eight - inch form			2
@entity111 reports that @entity4 will send out invites for the launch on october 10 , gathering tech journalists and stakeholders together to unveil the device			1
if @entity4 follows previous form , the event will be held in @entity125 , with a simultaneous launch on @entity127			0
images purporting to show the @entity29 suggest a device measuring 7.85inches , with an aluminium back - cover similar to the most recent @entity7			0
it is likely to sport a rear - facing camera and come with @entity4 's newest ' lightning ' connector , a controversial re-design which made previous accessories and chargers obsolete without an adapter			1
if @entity4 follows its usual design styles , it is likely to come in white and black versions , with a choice of @entity144 only , or a @entity146 option			0
the device , while still likely to garner a premium price - tag , will help @entity4 compete with the burgeoning smaller tablet market			1
the 7 - inch @entity95 tablet sells for Â£ 159 for the cheapest version , while @entity64 is also producing a budget tablet range			0
@entity154 was unconvinced that a smaller tablet would be a success , seeing it as a poor compromise between a tablet and a phone			0
however @entity4 appears to have had a change of heart , particularly now that the tablet market has now matured			2
one issue @entity4 might face by launching a @entity81 is a fragmentation in its core product lines			0
until the release of the @entity40 , @entity4 's two product lines had kept the same screen resolution , meaning apps did not need redesigning for different devices , a problem that plagues the competing @entity108 platform			0
but with the increased screen size of the @entity40 , some apps now have a black border , at least until the developers update their apps , and this problem may now afflict @entity4 's tablets , depending on the final size of the @entity81			0
front and back : alleged sightings of the @entity29 suggest it retains the simple , minimalist style of previous models according to these images , the @entity29 comes with dual speakers on the rim , as well as the newly - designed dock connector however this is unlikely to cause much of a worry to either developers or customers , as most apps will be updated quickly and developers still only have a small number of devices to consider , unlike @entity108 which has hundreds of combinations of models , screen sizes and software versions			0
@entity4 does not speak publicly on future devices , so the launch will not be confirmed until a minimalist white envelope arrives to the media , inviting them to meet the newest member of the @entity4 family			0
@entity4 are hoping to enter the 7 - inch tablet market with the expected unveiling of their @entity7 ' mini '			1

new device will have 7.85in lcd display , @entity4 supplier executives claim
@entity217 comes as two new leaked pictures emerge online
announcement expected on october 17 with the tablet hitting shelves on november 2 to head off competition from rivals
research suggests 1 - in - 4 of us own a tablet
