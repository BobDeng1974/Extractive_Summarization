by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 04:50 est , 25 september 2013 updated : 08:42 est , 25 september 2013 homes and businesses could be built in national parks if developers pay to make up the damage elsewhere			1
in a speech on boosting the rural economy , environment secretary @entity7 backed the idea of developments in some of @entity13 ’s most picturesque areas			1
in exchange construction firms would have to create new nature sites nearby to offset the damage caused			1
recovery : environment secretary @entity7 claims more development in national parks would boost rural economies the idea of increased development in @entity13 ’s 10 @entity23 including @entity24 , the @entity25 , @entity26 and the @entity27 could be controversial			1
but mr @entity7 argued that it could play a part in wider government plans designed to help boost growth and revive the rural economy			1
he used a speech to the @entity34 in @entity35 , @entity36 , to back the idea of ‘ biodiversity offsetting ’ in national parks			1
where a new development damages the natural environment , then a new nature site must be created to cancel out the damage			1
protections : @entity23 including the @entity25 could be open to more development under the plans he said : ‘ for too long we have allowed the lazy assumption that the environment and growth are incompatible objectives within the planning system			1
‘ i believe that , with a bit of innovative thinking , in many cases it is possible to have both			2
this is why i am particularly interested in @entity61			2
@entity61 gives us a chance to improve the way our planning system works			2
‘ it gets round the long - running conundrum of how to grow the economy at the same time as improving the environment			2
‘ it could provide real opportunities in our @entity23 , where the necessary extension of a farm building could result in the enhancement of an existing habitat or the creation of a new one			2
’ under existing rules the @entity76 has two statutory duties - to conserve the countryside and its wildlife , and to allow people to enjoy it			0
a spokesman for the @entity84 said : ' exactly how would it be possible for a developer to replace , for example , ancient hedgerows by way of mitigation ? ' some habitats , particularly sensitive ones , are irreplaceable and thoroughly integral to the landscape 's character because it 's taken centuries to evolve - you ca n't just order a new one to be delivered somewhere else like it 's an @entity100 purchase			0
' @entity61 does n't address the complex way in which wildlife systems are sustained and thrive , and if it allows developers to push through damaging schemes then it 's just another way for money to win over protecting nature			1
' @entity109 has 10 national parks including @entity27 ( left ) and @entity26 in @entity111 the government has launched a consultation on biodiversity offsetting , which is still open , mr @entity7 said			1
he stressed it was one of several policies which he thought could benefit national parks			0
he added : ' there are many opportunities for @entity23 to seize upon			0
one of these is the opportunity to capitalise on and increase the 110 million people who visit the @entity123 ’s @entity23 every year			0
' tourism is important because it provides people with new experiences			0
it enables people to appreciate and put a value on wildlife and wild places			0
' @entity124 also helps grow the economy			0
tourists spend money in our @entity23 and this supports 68,000 jobs			0
' but also when tourists return home they are more likely to buy the products we export			0
great clothing , great food and great drink			0

environment secretary @entity7 backs ' biodiversity offsetting '
