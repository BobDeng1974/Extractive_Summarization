@entity1 ceo @entity0 said one of his firm 's drugs was for ' western patients who can afford it ' the ceo of phamaceutical giant @entity1 has sparked fury after announcing one of the firm 's drugs was for ' western patients who can afford it '			1
@entity0 made the inflammatory comments after the @entity14 company @entity13 were granted a government licence to produce a copy of @entity1 ’s cancer drug @entity18 which they will sell for 97 per cent less than the original product			1
under @entity14 law the government grants compulsory licenses to domestic firms to produce copies of drugs if the original is n’t available locally at a reasonable price , regardless of whether they are under patent			2
mr @entity30 , who has previously described @entity14 's patent laws as ' essentially theft ' , said : ' we did not develop this medicine for @entity14			1
we developed it for western patients who can afford it			0
' @entity18 , which is also known as @entity18 , has been approved for the treatment of kidney cancer , advanced liver cancer ( hepatocellular carcinoma ) , and thyroid cancers that are resistant to radioactive iodine treatment			1
currently a kidney cancer patient would pay $ 96,000 ( £ 58,000 ) for a year 's course of the @entity1 - made drug			1
however the cost of the @entity13 version would be around $ 2,800 ( £ 1,700 )			1
mr @entity30 later posted a comment on a @entity50 blog claiming he regretted the way the comment was received			0
he wrote : ' i regret that what was a quick response from me within the framework of a panel discussion at the recent @entity58 conference has come across in a different way as it was meant by myself			2
' however , i was particularly frustrated by the @entity14 government ’s decision , to not protect a patent on @entity18 that was given to us by the @entity14 patent authority			2
nexavar : currently a kidney cancer patient would pay ( £ 58,00 for a year 's course of the @entity1 - made drug			1
however the cost of the @entity13 version would be around £ 1,700 ' i remain firm that there is no excuse for any country to weaken the intellectual property rights			1
without new medicines people in developing countries – as well as those in the more prosperous countries – ultimately will all suffer			0
' dr @entity78 , the executive director , @entity79 , which is trying to increase the availability of cancer drugs in developing countries said mr @entity83 's comments summed up ' everything that is wrong with the multinational pharmaceutical industry			2
' she added : ' @entity1 is effectively admitting that the drugs they develop are deliberately going to be rationed to the wealthiest patients			0
this is a side - effect of the way drugs are developed today			0
' pharmaceutical companies are singularly focused on profit and so aggressively push for patents and high drug prices			0
diseases that do n’t promise a profit are neglected , and patients who ca n’t afford to pay are cut out of the picture			0
' drug companies claim to care about global health needs , but their track record says otherwise			0
' however other commentators have pointed out that drug companies need to be able to charge high prices in order to continue the vital research and development .			0
