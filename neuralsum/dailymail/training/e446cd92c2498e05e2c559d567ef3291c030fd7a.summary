marine archaeologists say they have uncovered a wreck from one of @entity3 's 13th century mongol invasion fleets just yards off the coast of @entity6			1
scientists are hoping to be able to recreate a complete @entity9 vessel after the discovery of a 36ft - long section of keel just below the seabed off @entity14			1
@entity6 legend claims that two ' divine winds ' , known as @entity17 , destroyed both of @entity3 's vast invasion fleets with the loss of thousands of troops			1
watery grave : marine archaeologists have found a 36ft - long section of keel from @entity3 's @entity27 invasion fleet which sank off the coast of @entity6 in a typhoon in the 13th century historic : @entity3 launched to attempts to invade @entity6 from @entity31 , but both fleets were ravaged by typhoons known as ' @entity17 ' - or ' divine wind ' using ultrasound equipment , scientists found the well - preserved wreck 3ft below the seabed and it is the first from the period to have an intact hull			1
@entity42 , a professor of archaeology at @entity45 's @entity44 , said the keel section could help remodel the 60ft warship			1
he said : ' this discovery was of major importance for our research			0
' we are planning to expand search efforts and find further information that can help us restore the whole ship			0
' i believe we will be able to understand more about shipbuilding skills at the time as well as the actual situation of exchanges in @entity59			0
' artefacts : cannonballs and stone anchors are among thousands of items found around the shipwreck off the coast near @entity14 doomed : thousands of @entity27 , @entity66 and @entity68 troops drowned or were slaughtered by @entity6 samurai after the failed invasion attempts in 1274 and 1281 empire : scientists used ultrasound to find the shipwreck three feet below the sea bed , where it has remained remarkably well preserved more than 4,000 artefacts , including ceramic shards , ballast bricks , cannonballs and stone anchors have been found around the wreck , @entity77 reported			1
the hull will not be immediately salvaged , but the site will be covered with netting to prevent damage			0
the @entity17 - two powerful typhoons that struck seven years apart - halted the @entity27 expansion in the @entity89			1
historians say both attempts by the @entity9 to invade @entity6 ended in disaster			2
thwarted : @entity3 established the @entity9 in 1271 after removing opposition in the south of @entity68 and the @entity95 , in blue , spread from @entity97 to the @entity68 coast at its height invasion force : both fleets contained tens of thousands of well - armed troops who had initial success against @entity6 samurai , but the typhoons devastated them @entity106 : 900 ships sailed to @entity6 in the first invasion , and two forces of 4,400 ships took part in the second failed invasion the first , in 1274 , saw a fleet of reportedly 900 ships land at @entity115 and troops made initial inroads into @entity6 with their superior weaponry			1
but as a storm arrived , the @entity9 force was forced to retreat back to their ships after the @entity123 and it worsened into a typhoon which destroyed much of the fleet overnight , forcing the rest to limp back to @entity31			2
in 1281 , two separate forces of 900 and 3,500 ships carrying nearly 150,000 troops attempted another invasion			2
initially , the @entity66 , @entity68 and @entity27 troops captured the islands of @entity132 and @entity133 , but they were thwarted by improved seawall defences on the the @entity6 mainland			1
vision : @entity3 , grandson of @entity137 , united @entity68 under his rule and also led invasions into @entity140 before his death at the impressive age of 78 @entity3 was the fifth @entity143 of the @entity95 from 1260 to 1294 and the grandson of @entity137			1
his forces established the @entity9 in 1271 , setting up a capital near what is now @entity148 , and he became @entity149			0
by 1279 , he had removed all resistance from the @entity151 and became the first @entity153 emperor to conquer all of @entity68			0
after the heavy defeats and the deaths of his wife and son , he became grossly overweight and suffered from gout and diabetes			0
he died on february 18 , 1294 , at the age of 78 having handed over control of the @entity9 to his son			0
among his achievements was the introduction of paper currency in the @entity9			0
he also staged invasions in the north of @entity140			0
@entity169 's life story includes mentions of @entity3 , after he met him as a teenager travelling with his father			2
he was also mentioned in the 1797 poem @entity172 by @entity173 , in which he refers to his theoretical idea of building a ' @entity176 '			0
at the height of its power , the @entity95 extended from @entity97 , through @entity179 , @entity180 and on into @entity59 to include @entity181 , @entity68 and down into @entity140			2
a second typhoon then hit the @entity183 , destroying around 80 per cent of the fleet and seeing thousands of @entity3 's troops drowned or slaughtered by samurai as they managed to make landfall			2
@entity3 is widely believed to have rushed to assemble his enormous fleets in under a year - particularly in the second invasion - forcing shipbuilders to use river boats that were not suitable for the sea			1
he is even thought to have vowed to carry out a third invasion before his death at the impressive age of 78			0
invasion route : both fleets set off from @entity31 with thousands of troops on board for the 110 - mile journey between @entity201 and the @entity6 coast			1
