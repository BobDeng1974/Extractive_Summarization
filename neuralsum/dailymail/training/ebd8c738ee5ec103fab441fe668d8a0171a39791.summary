by @entity0 @entity1 thinks @entity2 should seriously consider dropping @entity3 from @entity5 's starting line - up in @entity6			1
the former @entity8 and @entity9 striker , who scored 48 times in 80 appearances for @entity5 , said that @entity2 should n't be afraid to leave @entity3 out of the side			1
@entity1 , who tweeted a picture of him with @entity14 on a beach , wants @entity16 to play as the most advanced striker for @entity5 in @entity6			1
that 's something that @entity3 does n't do as often			2
' he ( @entity3 ) is very good at coming off , creating space , turning , hitting shots hard and bringing other people into the game , but in terms of a threat in behind the opposition defence , that is @entity16 's territory			1
' but , while @entity1 thinks the @entity40 striker should play up front , he admits that it could be difficult to find a place for @entity3 to slot into			2
royal appointment : @entity3 and @entity16 met prince @entity18 at @entity46 last week strike : @entity16 gave @entity5 the lead against @entity49 with a stunning strike from the edge of the box make way : @entity3 could be dropped in favour of other players such as @entity56 @entity1 said : ' you ’ve got the conundrum – if @entity16 is up top in the system , where do you play @entity3 ? @entity3 can play anywhere			1
he can play on the right , he can play on the left , he can even play a forward midfield role			0
' but the question then is , " have you better players in those particular positions than @entity3 ? " we ’ve got all sorts of options			0
you could have [ @entity56 ] @entity56 playing on one side , the possibility of [ @entity74 ] @entity73 playing on either side , [ @entity77 ] @entity76 , of course , which has been favoured by @entity2 in his teams and you ’d expect him to play on the left - hand side because he covers a lot of ground			2
' it will be interesting to see which way @entity2 goes			0
or whether he sets back to that old way we played two years ago against @entity88 , with two lines of four , @entity3 and someone else up top			0
so all sorts of possibilities			0
it will be fascinating to see which way he goes			0
