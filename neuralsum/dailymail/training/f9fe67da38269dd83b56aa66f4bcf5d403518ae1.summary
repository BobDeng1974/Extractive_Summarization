a rare thing happened at @entity1 on saturday : @entity2 won the game for @entity4			1
it was an isolated moment of class in a game of unremitting drudgery			2
in fact , it was just about the only moment of class			0
@entity13 played a ball into the box from the @entity4 right midway through the second half and @entity2 took it down with the sweetest of touches			1
in the same movement , the @entity18 spun away from @entity21 ’s @entity20 and was pulled back as he shaped to shoot			2
@entity2 goes down under the challenge of @entity23 and @entity24 to win a penalty @entity2 's touch which led to the penalty was a reminder of his quality , and changed the course of the game @entity24 was sent off for his part in bringing down the @entity18 , but it should have been @entity23 @entity34 stepped up to convert the penalty , putting @entity4 into the lead at @entity1 referee @entity37 sent off @entity24 by mistake , @entity34 scored the resultant penalty and the game was effectively over			1
it was a tantalising glimpse of the player @entity2 used to be , @entity44 ’s feared penalty - box predator who could terrorise the best defences			1
a few seconds later , he was substituted for @entity47			0
a thunderclap of boos rolled around the stadium in protest			0
in many ways , it was hard to argue with manager @entity55 ’s decision			2
@entity2 was lucky he had lasted that long			2
his £ 60 million team - mate , @entity56 , had been taken off at half - time after an anonymous first half			1
before the crucial penalty @entity2 had been ineffectual , failing to find the form that brought him to @entity1 @entity2 has not done enough to convince @entity55 he should be signed permanently this summer @entity56 was also off the pace in @entity4 's 2 - 0 win over @entity21 and was replaced at half time @entity64 insisted that @entity65 still needs time to adapt , but he should apply the same principle to @entity2 there were no complaints about that and the truth is that @entity2 , 29 , had been very much @entity65 ’s equal in mediocrity			1
most of the time , his second touch was a tackle			0
it ’s an old saying but it rang true for @entity2 in the opening 45 minutes			0
the ball kept bouncing off him			0
‘ i was very pleased with his action for the penalty because he won it for us , ’ said @entity64			0
‘ but i had to win the game and i saw at that moment that we needed to keep the ball more and with @entity47 it is more easy to keep the ball			0
’ once again on saturday , @entity2 ’s former knack of poaching goals from nowhere appeared , once again , to have deserted him			1
sure , the service he received was hardly up to the standard that @entity4 forwards of the past have been used to			0
@entity2 looks on disappointed as another @entity4 chance goes begging , while @entity34 bends over the @entity18 striker has become more notable for missing chances than scoring them since joining @entity4 @entity2 's goals have been few and far between , but his match - winning touch showed he has still got it but on the few occasions that @entity100 , @entity4 ’s liveliest forward , did force his way to the byline and cut back crosses , @entity2 was out of the picture			1
in that first half , he was marked out of the game by former @entity4 defender @entity24 , who did n’t give him a kick			1
@entity24 is a good player but he ’s not exactly @entity108			0
in the circumstances , @entity2 was lucky to make it back out for the second half			0
he has scored just four goals in 17 league appearances for @entity4 this season			1
his threat has been negligible			0
the consensus is that time is running out for him to persuade @entity64 and the rest of the @entity4 hierarchy that it would be responsible for them to spend the £ 40m to make his loan deal from @entity122 permanent at the end of the season			1
@entity2 , once so dynamic a poacher in the penalty area , was rarely in the right place at the right time the striker continued to work hard throughout , but until the penalty showed very little quality the 29 - year - old applauds the @entity4 fans , who have stuck by him through his form troubles however wonderful a striker @entity2 used to be , the hard truth is that on the basis of what @entity4 have seen so far , if they had to make their decision today , he is simply not worth it			1
and yet having invested so much in him emotionally , having hailed him as a goalscoring hero when he arrived in the summer , @entity4 ’s supporters are reluctant to give up on him just yet			2
to their credit , they have been relentlessly supportive of @entity2			0
their yearning for him to rediscover his quality has never curdled into disillusionment			0
and to @entity2 ’s credit , he has never stopped working			0
that is part of the reason @entity4 fans have stuck by him			1
if @entity65 has developed a tendency to drift aimlessly through games , @entity2 has never stopped running himself into the ground			0
@entity2 shakes hands with @entity4 staff members after being replaced on the hour - mark on saturday @entity47 was brought on by @entity64 to help @entity4 retain possession better once in the lead and while he is still capable of producing a moment of magic like saturday 's pivotal moment , there will still be those who will dream he can return to his former self			1
in those circumstances , might @entity64 have kept @entity2 on the pitch for a while to see if he could capitalise on the confidence that winning that penalty had brought him ? if there is even a slim chance of bringing a player of his pedigree back to life , then surely it is worth taking			2
@entity64 had said on friday that the reason @entity4 are not challenging for the title is that they do not have a 20 - goal - a - season striker			1
but @entity2 was brought to the club to be that striker			2
resurrect him and @entity4 ’s chances of making the top four and securing a place in the @entity184 next season will improve dramatically			2
@entity2 celebrates with @entity34 , and could yet prove to be important in @entity4 's push for @entity186 if @entity64 can help his forward to find confidence , he could have the striker he thought he had signed instead , the chance to breathe confidence back into him was missed and when the final whistle blew , @entity2 walked alone along the touchline , applauded all the way by the home supporters			1
many saw @entity64 ’s decision to substitute him as a sign that he has already made up his mind to let him go			0
but when the @entity4 boss spoke about @entity65 afterwards , he was at pains to point out that it takes time to settle in the @entity203			1
the same logic applies to @entity2 , maybe even more so given that he is still recovering from a serious knee injury that ruled him out of last summer ’s @entity206			0
while he can still turn a game with one moment of brilliance , it would seem like folly to abandon him now			2
the most important moments of @entity4 ’s season lie ahead and if @entity2 can replicate saturday 's touch of class more regularly , he may yet emerge as the hero @entity1 ’s fans so desperately want him to be .			1

@entity18 striker @entity2 has *largely* disappointed this season
but his moment of brilliance on saturday changed the game
@entity4 fans have stuck by 29 - year - old despite poor displays
like @entity56 , the striker needs time to adapt to @entity203
@entity55 should continue to give @entity2 a chance to show brilliance
