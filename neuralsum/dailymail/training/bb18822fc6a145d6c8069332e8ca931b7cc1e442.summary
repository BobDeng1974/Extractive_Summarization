his hands resting on the shoulders of prince @entity3 and @entity4 , a relaxed @entity5 smiles for the camera			1
taken six years ago , it is the first picture of the 43 - year - old photo - journalist with the @entity9 since he was revealed to be the third @entity11 hostage held by @entity13 fanatics in @entity14			1
with the bushlands of @entity17 providing a stunning background and smiling faces , it is a stark contrast to the images of the @entity21 shown on the chilling is propaganda video claiming he had been ‘ abandoned ’ by the government			1
he was the official photographer on the journey that saw the small team live , sleep , eat and ride together			0
@entity5 is said to have got to know the @entity27 well during the outback trip that involved crossing more than 70 rivers , with @entity4 in particular reportedly sharing his passion for motorbikes			1
the off - road enduro africa 2008 bike ride raised money for charities including @entity44 , the organisation to help aids orphans in @entity47 set up by @entity4 in his mother ’s memory			1
at the time , @entity5 told friends how ‘ nice and natural ’ the @entity27 were , acting like ‘ one of the lads ’			1
while they have not been in touch since , they are aware of his plight			0
how the brothers must be feeling for their former companion now			0
@entity5 was seized in 2012 with @entity58 journalist @entity57			1
hostage : the @entity11 photojournalist makes a gun gesture in this week 's @entity63 video			1
he was seized in 2012 with @entity58 journalist @entity57 - the two men were great friends the pair were great friends and had been on a euphoric high after a daring three - week reporting trip into war - ravaged @entity14			1
so the pair were in good spirits on that day in november 2012 as they prepared to head for home			2
along the way they stopped at an internet cafe , where they spent a few hours sending stories , chatting to friends on @entity77 and sipping cold drinks			0
then they hailed a taxi			0
but as they headed towards safety and the @entity84 border , a @entity86 mini-van with blacked out windows raced up alongside and forced the taxi to stop			1
the men inside were part of an @entity92 gang			0
their faces covered by masks , they were also armed			0
after checking the @entity96 had paid their taxi driver , the @entity95 ordered the two journalists out of the car			0
seized : a news blackout about the @entity5 kidnapping has been in place at the request of the @entity11 government and his family since he was captured			1
above , @entity5 talks directly to camera in the video they were ordered to kneel on the ground , and their local ‘ fixer ’ was forced to tie them up			1
then @entity5 and @entity57 were bundled into the @entity86			1
the hostage - takers told the @entity14 fixer they wanted to take the men ‘ for five minutes to ask them a question ’			1
but the journalists never returned			0
indeed , they were destined to be passed on or traded to the feared fighters of @entity13			2
ever since that terrifying incident on a dusty @entity14 road , a news blackout about the @entity5 kidnapping has been in place at the request of the @entity11 government and his family			1
but the blackout was shattered on thursday when he was forced to record a bizarre propaganda video , promising to reveal the ‘ lies ’ told by the @entity135 media about his is captors			1
his friend @entity57 was beheaded by @entity139 in a horrific video released in august			1
despite this , @entity5 appeared calm and composed in the new footage , which was released following the beheading of @entity144 , a @entity11 aid worker , and @entity146 , a @entity58 journalist			1
although he appeared thinner than before , there were no visible signs of torture or injuries			0
composed : @entity5 appeared calm and composed in the new footage , pictured above , which was released following the beheading of @entity144 , a @entity11 aid worker , and @entity146 , a @entity58 journalist but the @entity152 can today reveal that the @entity21 and his fellow hostages have been put through ‘ a living hell ’ , according to security sources with intimate knowledge of their ordeal , and have even been forced to fight with each other for the entertainment of the jihadis			1
in interviews with security sources and other former hostages , our investigation provides the first detailed account of what happened to @entity5 and the other men			1
it makes for gruesome reading			0
after @entity5 and @entity57 were seized near the border , they were moved from prison to prison by the hostage takers before being passed to @entity139			1
the torture began almost immediately , overseen by @entity11 jihadists who became known by the hostages as ‘ @entity179 ’			2
both @entity5 and @entity57 were ‘ water boarded ’ – an interrogation technique that simulates drowning , in which the victim is strapped down with their mouth and nose covered with cloth , before large quantities of water are poured over their faces			1
they were also given electric shocks , and shot with @entity193 , stun - guns which cause temporary paralysis , after being dragged from their cells to be ‘ punished ’ for any behaviour their captors deemed a breach of their rules			0
‘ the water - boarding was not every day – maybe two or three times , ’ one source in contact with the foreign hostages told the @entity152 , adding that the @entity11 militants were the most brutal			1
‘ the @entity11 jihadis did the most appalling stuff in the world – they were psychopathic			2
’ worse was to come			0
four months after @entity5 and @entity57 were captured , two other westerners – briton @entity144 and an @entity214 aid worker called @entity215 – were bundled into the same secret prison inside @entity14			1
by this time , their captors had devised a new and macabre form of torture			0
the four hostages were forced to take part in boxing matches against each other – like some sick pastiche of the film @entity226			2
the losers of these bouts were tortured			0
according to impeccable sources , @entity5 and @entity57 were once forced to fight each other			1
during other barbaric bouts , they were instructed to fight @entity144 and @entity215			0
these fights , which the hostages dubbed the ‘ @entity236 ’ , were held almost entirely for the entertainment of their @entity11 captors , one of whom once claimed to have been a boxer in the @entity11 before leaving to join the @entity95 jihad			1
during these forced gladiator - style bouts , the jihadis known as the ‘ @entity242 ’ watched from a skylight above in order to get a better view of the fighting below			2
according to sources who have spoken directly to some of the hostages , the men ‘ were so exhausted that they did n’t know what they were doing			2
they could n’t put any effort into it because they were being tortured so badly ’			0
tortured : the @entity21 , above in the propaganda video , and his fellow hostages have been put through ‘ a living hell ’ , according to security sources with intimate knowledge of their ordeal but the @entity266 , who spoke with @entity269 accents , were too enthusiastic in their torture of the hostages for the taste of their fellow jihadis			1
it is understood they were at one point taken off the job of guarding the @entity96 because of their brutality			0
‘ the @entity11 jihadis got into trouble because they were considered to be so brutal , ’ the source said			2
@entity282 was released earlier this year after a ransom – believed to be about £ 2.5million – was paid by the @entity214 government after direct negotiations with his captors			2
some 15 other hostages were also released after payments of £ 30million by @entity290 governments , families and insurers			2
but @entity11 and @entity58 have steadfastly refused to pay any ransom demands for hostages – a stance that prompted @entity5 , in the video released this week , to attack @entity297			1
‘ i have been abandoned by my government , ’ he said			0
‘ my fate lies in the hands of the @entity13			2
maybe i will live and maybe i will die			0
i have nothing to lose			0
’ he spoke after the brutal murders of three of his fellow prisoners			0
first , @entity57 was beheaded in a video which appeared online last month , and which was introduced by a @entity11 militant nicknamed ‘ @entity308 ’			1
two weeks later , @entity146 was killed			0
@entity144 , an aid worker from @entity309 , was the next to die			0
a gruesome video of his beheading was posted online last week			2
a video of @entity313 , 47 , a former taxi driver from @entity314 , was also released this week amid fears that he , too , will be slaughtered			1
as for @entity5 , his physical condition , despite the hardships and torture over almost two years of captivity , appears to be good			2
but the mental strain has been huge			0
‘ there was no @entity327 , ’ said one source , referring to the condition where long - term hostages take on the ideology of their captors			2
‘ he did not make that video of his own volition			0
’ his @entity11 sense of humour may also have helped him survive this long			2
‘ @entity179 liked him , ’ said the source			0
‘ they liked his sense of humour			0
he was in their good books , at least for a while			0
’ in truth , @entity5 , from @entity340 in @entity341 , knew the inherent risks in @entity14			1
an experienced photo - journalist , he had covered the war in @entity346 and spent five months embedded with @entity58 forces			1
so where is he now ? he is believed to have been transported to @entity349 , a dusty @entity14 town which is now the headquarters of the @entity13			2
below the streets , there is a sophisticated tunnel network , which terrorists use to move men and weapons around the city			0
there are also reports that foreign hostages are being held underground			2
above ground , fear reigns : anyone caught smoking in public faces a public lashing			0
alcohol and other drugs are banned , with miscreants facing death by execution			0
this , then , is now the city which is the focus of military planners in @entity11 and @entity58 hunting the surviving hostages			1
now , as well as air strikes , surveillance drones are constantly flying over the city			0
whether they find @entity5 in time to save his life remains to be seen .			0
