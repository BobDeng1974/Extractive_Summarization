@entity10 ’s impact was evident , quite literally , from the first minute until the last			2
first there was a goal inside 31 seconds on his return to the dugout and then @entity8 - brought back to @entity15 by the new boss on friday - salvaged a point in the fifth minute of stoppage time after a breathtaking finale at @entity5			1

for @entity22 , it is about rebuilding a reputation damaged by a season in the shadows at @entity119 after his £ 15million move last summer			2
@entity10 , meanwhile , wants to ‘ pay back ’ the club some four - and - a - half years after leaving for @entity123			1
both he and his opposite number @entity125 could make a case that their side deserved to win this pulsating contest			2
@entity25 flew out of the blocks as @entity39 netted inside the first minute			1
@entity125 ’s men equalised through @entity42 - their first league goal of the season - before @entity50 restored the visitors ’ advantage just after half - time			1
but 18 - year - old substitute @entity58 headed the hosts level before he assisted @entity64 for what appeared to be the winner two minutes from time			1
@entity22 , though , had other ideas			0
and @entity10 said : ‘ you ca n’t ask much more than what they gave me			2
they played like i thought they could			0
‘ the one thing i love about football is when you ’ve got a group of players who want to come in and train , want to tackle , want to put their heads in			0
so for however long it lasts i ’m going to enjoy it			0
’ on point - saver @entity157 , he added : ‘ i said to him “ smile a lot ”			2
he ’s not being playing much and if he enjoys himself he ’ll be a threat in this league			0
it ’s a big season for him ’			0
meanwhile , @entity125 reflected : ‘ we ’ve conceded a goal after 30 seconds and straight after half - time , but have come back each time			1
‘ we then got carried away when we took the lead			0
it was at a time in the game when we should have seen it out			2
@entity22 is a player that we ’ve talked about here and admired him , so it ’s more galling that he ’s scored the equaliser			0
’ all the attention before the game had been on @entity10 and @entity33 midfielder @entity79 , signed on a free from rivals @entity177 , who was included in @entity181 ’s @entity180 squad this week			1
under pressure : @entity33 left - back @entity78 ( right ) competes with @entity25 's @entity50 ( left ) for the ball during the match at @entity5 ' tackle : @entity50 ( centre ) of @entity25 had a magnificent game for @entity25 despite having fallen out with new boss @entity10 in the past welcome return : @entity25 manager @entity10 ( right ) enjoyed a good start to his second reign as @entity25 boss with a 3 - 3 draw at @entity33 but it was @entity58 - called up to the @entity180 under - 20 set - up for the first time on thursday - who threatened to steal the headlines until @entity22 ’s last - gasp intervention			1
@entity39 ’s close - range opener was cancelled out when @entity42 poked in via a deflection before half - time , only for @entity50 to volley an emphatic second for the visitors after the break			1
@entity33 were short on ideas until the introduction of @entity58 and he sprung highest to head home from a @entity81 corner , bringing parity and relief to @entity5 ’ on 73 minutes			1
and it was his trickery and cross-cum - shot which allowed @entity64 to stab in his first for the club after the ball had rebounded off the upright			2

you just need that sub to make the impact and @entity58 certainly did that today			2
‘ i have given a lot of good players their debut - @entity239 , @entity241 , @entity242 among them - and he ’s up there with them			0
he ’s got something about him			0
’ but it was @entity22 who stole the show at the death , much to the annoyance of @entity125			0
‘ they came here and wasted time from the first minute			0
they are then 3 - 2 down and they get seven minutes added time - in the spirit of the game i thought that was wrong , ’ he said			2
on the subject of spirit , @entity10 had no complaints			0
‘ @entity263 ( @entity264 ) must have done a fantastic job , ’ he said			0
‘ because they ’ve got a great camaraderie here			0
