for decades climbing enthusiasts have sought to follow in the footsteps of sir @entity2 and conquer the highest peak on @entity5 - @entity4			1
but behind them , they have left a trail of destruction - creating an average of 50 tons of rubbish , including discarded oxygen canisters , climbing gear and food packaging , every year			1
the problem escalated to the point where the fragile ecosystem of the @entity16 was under threat			1
but after three years of hard graft in life - threatening conditions , a pioneering to team of clean up experts believe they are about to solve the mountain 's pollution problem for good			1
clean up : a pioneering project has seen tonnes of hazardous rubbish brought down from the summit of @entity4 intrusion : piles of abandoned climbing gear and human waste has threatened to wipe out the @entity16 eco-system problem : this huge haul of discarded oxygen cylinders demonstrates the scale of rubbish dumping on @entity4 hundreds of tons of human waste , abandoned climbing gear , tents , oxygen bottles , discarded food packing and even bodies littered the mountainside and threatened to destroy an entire eco-system just decades after mankind first reached it			1
villagers who have made their homes in the @entity16 slopes have had their isolated lives intruded on by wealthy westerners chasing fame and glory - and left with contaminated drinking and food supplies			1
the problem forced the @entity63 government to react almost a decade ago , forcing @entity4 tourists to take responsibility for their gear having already paid a £ 45,000 premium to climb the mountain			1
and a group of environmental volunteers orchestrated the @entity72 project to begin the unenviable mission to clean up the world 's highest attraction			1
writer and environmental photographer @entity76 has worked with the group to capture the scale of the issue and revealed the changes that need to be made			0
@entity76 said : ' the enormous growth in visitors has brought great strains on the natural environment and produced mountains of rubbish - from base camp and up to the high ' death zone '			2
' in sherpa villages along the trekking routes there has never been a sustainable waste disposal system in place			0
' as 50 tons of waste is left behind every season , the consequences have been an eyesore and a threat to the fragile environment			1
' the overall goals of the project , which officially launched in 2010 , are to conserve and manage the rich biological diversity of @entity63 's @entity104			0
the emphasis is on solid waste management and on supporting and strengthening local communities as the caretakers of biodiversity conservation			0
end in sight : after three years of hard work collecting rubbish the team believe their project is nearing completion @entity116 needed : campaigners will ask climbing groups to sign up to a @entity119 in future to safeguard the future of the mountain after three years of death - defying work , scaling the treacherous peaks to clean up after others , the group are nearing completion			1
they have pulled down almost 10 tons of hazardous trash from @entity4 's summit , introduced safe waste management techniques for local villages and tourists and installed at least 15 waste treatment facilities			1
new era : the group have also introduced waste treatment facilities and safe waste management techniques to the local village the project workers , led by @entity142 @entity141 , have strived to implement a system of sustainable waste control and are taking the chance to finish their work in the current summer climbing season			2
@entity141 said : ' our main focus is on improving the waste management situation in the @entity152 / @entity4 area and to raise awareness about it			0
' working with @entity156 we support the local institutions in improving existing systems , a new incinerator is in use and porters , locals and school students get training on how to manage waste properly			0
' we 've also installed waste bins along the trails - the next step will be to co-finance public toilets for tourists and porters - as toilets either do not exist or currently in extremely poor condition			2
' the project has now grown to bring together governments and organisations working for preserving the wilderness close to @entity63 's greatest natural wonder			0
the next decade will be challenging to preserve the groups ' endeavours and ensure that all future summit parties adhere to a new @entity119			1
@entity181 , director of @entity156 , said : ' people are very quick to talk about the issue of waste in the mountains but nobody comes up with any proper solutions			0
' we can not afford to simply clean up @entity4 every now and then - we have to educate people about waste management and ensure it happens			2
' the volunteers are working with the @entity63 government to issue stricter penalties for litterbugs - parties now have to sign a £ 2,500 deposit to ensure they return all the equipment they went up with			0
but despite fears that tourists would permanently destroy @entity4 and the surrounding peaks , thousands of locals still rely on the economic boost they bring			1
threat : around 50 tones of rubbish is left on @entity4 every climbing season eyesore : just beyond the tourist trail lies a huge rubbish dump , right , but after three years of hard work the clean up is almost complete , left @entity214 guides and sherpas make their living by leading expeditions to base camps and beyond , while entrepreneurs have set up small businesses to cater for seasonal climbers			1
the greatest climber of all time @entity224 , who was born and lived on the rocky outcrops for 44 years leading wealthy mountaineers to the top , insists that tourism is a great thing for the country			2
known as the ' @entity231 ' , @entity224 holds the record for climbing @entity4 an unsurpassable 21 times and has seen the effect of commercialisation on the local people			2
@entity224 , 51 , said : ' i met sir @entity2 and it was very special , he used to come every year to @entity63 and even our school was built by him - he helped the country a lot			2
with schools , monasteries , clinics and health care			0
' sherpa culture is very good and we want to preserve it and the tourists that keep coming is a good thing for poor sherpa people and people who live in @entity63			2
they bring money and give us jobs that we depend on to support our families			0
' but @entity224 's views are not shared by everyone , as @entity262 leader @entity261 reveals the difficulties that have been brought by travellers			0
his holiness said : ' we almost never had a problem with waste			0
what waste we produced washed away with snow and rain			0
' the waste of today - metal tins , paper and plastic - ca n't be taken away just by snow or rain			0

up to 50 tons of rubbish left by climbing tourists every year
problem had threatened to destroy fragile ecosystem of the @entity16
clean up team have spent three years hauling rubbish from mountain
now want to make climbing groups adhere to @entity119
