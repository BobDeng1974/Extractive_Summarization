by @entity0 published : 18:16 est , 10 july 2013 updated : 18:18 est , 10 july 2013 controlling : @entity1 is typical of the sort of man who has to have the last word the last thing @entity7 would have expected when she picked up the sunday newspapers last weekend was to read that her husband of ten years was filing for divorce			1
@entity1 chose to announce the end of their marriage in the coldest and most calculating of ways			1
each word of his statement made me shiver in recognition			1
this was the valedictory missive of a controlling man prepared to sacrifice everything just to have the last word			1
it 's only a month since @entity7 suffered the very public humiliation of being photographed with her husband 's hands around her throat			1
how could such a strong , beautiful , hugely successful woman let herself be treated that way ? when i read the @entity32 : i 'm divorcing you , @entity7 ' , i was hit by a sense of sick dread			1
why ? because @entity36 , too , have suffered the grave misfortune of falling in love with more than one such control freak in my lifetime			1
there is a misconception that controlling men seek out plain , meek women			1
but in my experience , that is not the case			1
there is , after all , no sport in leading a lamb to slaughter			1
no , the challenge for such men is to bring a successful woman down from a great height			1
that 's real power ; complete domination			1
such men are seductive creatures , shrewdly camouflaging their real character in the beginning , showering you with love so you feel you are the centre of their universe			2
but then the subtle changes start			2
there 's the carping about the little things , the looks of disappointment , the casually cruel comments about the way you look or gentle criticism of your work , all of which chip away at your self - confidence			1
take the behaviour of my ex , @entity78 , a journalist			2
i was with him for five years after we met in our late 20s and still wince when i remember how he could turn a compliment into a devastating blow			2
one evening , for example , after a long day at work , i hurriedly changed in the office loo into a beautiful dress i had bought specially for a party he was hosting			2
when i arrived , he was sitting on a bar stool surrounded by colleagues			2
he beckoned me over with a crook of his little finger			2
with all of them watching , he leant forward and kissed me on the forehead			2
' look at you , darling ! ' he said admiringly , then whispered : ' that dress does nothing to disguise your bottom , but i love you			2
' there you have the control freak 's sinister double whammy : insult then compliment ; knock you down then help you up			1
trophy wife : @entity1 probably regarded @entity7 as his prize exhibit - until he felt she was neglecting him for her career i shudder to this day at the memory of it , and the way he started to begin every sentence with : ' the problem with you , @entity116 , is … ' a hundred things could ignite his ire : the way i 'd cooked dinner , the fact i 'd forgotten to pick up his dry - cleaning , or his belief that i did n't pay him enough attention when we went out together			1
increasingly , his underlying theme was that he felt i was putting my work before him			2
i suspect @entity7 , 53 , found herself in the same situation			2
those who know 70 - year - old @entity130 say he is a control freak who could not stomach @entity7 's success			1
he is infamous for the way he seeks to arrange everyone and everything around him as though they were exhibits in one of his minimalist art galleries			2
@entity7 - for a while at least - was the prize exhibit			2
i had first - hand experience of his controlling ways when , in the 1980s , i was marketing director of a major newspaper group and his company , @entity130 , was our advertising agency			2
always dressed immaculately in a black suit and white shirt , @entity130 was one of the coldest men i have ever met			2
he did n't suffer fools gladly , and to him , almost everyone was a fool			2
we can only speculate what had been going on in their marriage prior to that humiliating , brutish scene in the restaurant			0
my guess would be that , just like my own relationship with @entity78 , their problems began had begun many years before			0
at the beginning , @entity78 loved having a trophy girlfriend and relished the fact that people recognised me in the street			0
in the end , though , he perceived my work as a threat : it made me neglect him , he said			0
it was only by constantly putting me down that he felt he was able to control me and stop me doing the thing he most feared - leaving him			1
which , of course , i eventually did			0
happier days : the couple dining at @entity182 's restaurant , the same place where @entity1 would infamously grab @entity7 's throat , precipitating their divorce what 's so ironic is that controllers end up hating the strong , successful woman to whom they were once so drawn			1
a friend of @entity7 's has admitted : ' @entity1 never liked her being famous			1
he used to cringe if people came up when they were having a meal			0
it did n't suit his ego to be seen as mr @entity7			0
' when i read that i almost wept , recalling my ex 's reaction when he was sometimes introduced as ' mr @entity198 '			1
it was as though he 'd been castrated on the spot			0
after our separation , he told me : ' i just got sick of living in your shadow			0
' i wanted to scream back : ' then try casting one of your own ! ' to my surprise and shame , i seldom fought back during the relationship			0
i never said : ' forget my bum , look at the size of your gut			0
' i never mentioned the fact that he was stagnating in his career as he criticised the choices i made in mine			0
not once did i berate him for not lifting a finger to help in the house , even though i paid the mortgage			0
my behaviour is , i think , typical of many so - called strong career women			1
yes , we can make tough decisions in the workplace , but at home we just seek peace and companionship			0
we enter the fray each day at work , so it 's the last thing we want at home			1
@entity7 's friends say she became the ' ultimate pacifier ' , wary of her husband 's moods and temper			1
oh , how i can relate to that			0
when you 're with a control freak , you feel you are walking on eggshells , always trying to second - guess him			1
like many successful men , @entity130 was drawn to a remarkable and beautiful woman			0
most men would love nothing more than to be married to one of the country 's best cooks , yet @entity130 never forgot to mention that he did n't like her cooking and preferred cheese on toast			1
the controller turns every situation into a new opportunity to abase their victim - as @entity130 did when confronted by photos taken at @entity182 's restaurant appearing to show him restraining his wife by pushing on the base of her nose			1
in fact , he insisted , he was cleaning her face as one might a child 's			1
' even domestic goddesses sometimes have a bit of snot , ' he said , humiliatingly			0
he never went to parties , so his wife often went alone , corseted in @entity275 and looking splendid but sadly alone			0
the message seemed to be that her silly superficial world was not engaging enough for him			0
another ex of mine , a businessman i dated in my late 30s and almost married , used the same ploy			0
he refused to go out with me and my friends , dismissing them as ' boring ' sycophants who were only interested in the fact that i was well - known			0
it was his way of trying to cut me off from those i was closest to			0
thankfully , it did n't work			0
it takes time and experience to spot the tricks of the controller , and another of my exes eventually revealed himself as one such			0
the first time i got a big promotion and wanted him to celebrate with me and my workmates , he said he was so ill he had to go to hospital			0
i rushed home , as he knew i would , only to find him watching tv , saying he was feeling a little better			0
that pattern of mystery illnesses repeated itself again and again			0
but as well as playing games with my good nature , this man exploited my insecurities			1
even when i was slim , he 'd pat my tummy in a seemingly loving way and say : ' could lose a few pounds there , could n't we ? ' hurtful : @entity130 never forgot to mention he did n't like @entity7 's cooking and preferred cheese on toast most shockingly , after i 'd had a major operation , lost 2st and was skeletal , he hugged me in front of my friends and said : ' finally she 's got her figure back			1
' when i finally left him , he told friends i 'd gone mad and left the country			0
as with @entity130 , he was desperate to have the last word on the relationship			0
he even called my friends and said i 'd become delusional and was in @entity327 with a new boyfriend			0
one of my more savvy friends emailed him , copying me and my friends into it , saying : ' that 's funny , i 've just had lunch with @entity116 in @entity335			1
' now i 'm in my 50s			0
i have well - honed radar against such men and try to seek out those who are kind and considerate			1
i can only hope @entity7 learns from her experiences in the same way			0
any bruises on @entity7 's throat will have healed by now , though i suspect those in her heart will linger			1
they will heal , however , and she should take comfort in the knowledge that she will never again have to hear those sinister words : ' the problem with you , @entity7 , is … '			0

the way @entity1 announced his divorce shows how calculating he is
but it 's typical of a certain kind of man who *craves* control
