an @entity1 lottery worker is accused of manipulating the system to try and collect a $ 14.3million payday			1
@entity4 , 51 , of @entity5 , @entity1 , was originally charged with two felony counts of fraud when he was arrested in january for illegally playing the lottery and having a friend collect his prize , but now prosecutors say he used an intricate system to make sure he would win			1
they argue he installed a self - destructing hack program to make sure the @entity14 selected his number in december 2010 , and that he tampered with security cameras in the building so he would not be caught installing the program			1
his trial had been due to start monday but defense lawyers asked for it to be delayed to they could examine the new evidence			0
authorities had been trying to identify the winner of the $ 14.3 million @entity41 ticket since a @entity43 lawyer tried to claim the prize shortly before the one - year deadline in 2011			1
when attorney @entity47 tried to claim the jackpot with the winning ticket in his hands , lottery officials confirmed the ticket was valid , but they refused to pay because @entity47 would n't name anyone involved with the purchase and handling of the ticket			2
he later withdrew the claim and said he did n't know the winner 's identity			0
then , authorities released a convenience store video in october which purported to show the mystery winner , in an attempt to help identify him , at which point a former co-worker of @entity4 's subsequently contacted authorities and tipped them off			0
detectives then analyzed the ticket purchaser 's voice in the video and matched a license plate in the parking lot of the convenience store to @entity4			0
authorities say @entity4 contacted two men in @entity76 asking for help to claim the jackpot anonymously			2
it was only after he was arrested that police began to look into whether or not he had tampered with any equipment , at which point they claim it became clear he had used his computer skills to make certain he won			2
@entity4 reportedly told a coworker he had created a root kit shortly before he won the lottery , a self - destructing program that can do anything and then disappear without a trace			0
as for why he is never seen on the security camera installing this kit , prosecutors claim the cameras were programmed to change the way they record that day , and that @entity4 was one of five people that could do this			1
furthermore , the four other individuals will testify they did not manipulate the security cameras			0
@entity4 's lawyer has said all these claims are impossible , and that his client did not hack the system			0
@entity106 , who tried to claim the ticket , was arrested in march and also charged with two counts of fraud .			1
