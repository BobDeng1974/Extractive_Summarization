they have described themselves as the ' @entity2 ' of their day - the ' lily white ' @entity4 chosen to accompany the @entity5 on her @entity6			1
lady @entity7 , @entity8 , @entity9 , lady @entity10 , lady @entity11 and @entity12 were chosen for their ' decorative ' beauty as well as their ability to carry the @entity5 's heavy train			1
all six were reunited at @entity18 today to celebrate sixty years since that momentous day			1
the @entity5 on her @entity6 in 1953 , accompanied by the six women who now call themselves ' @entity5 's @entity2 ' according to @entity25 - then lady @entity9 - behind the pomp , preparations for one of the most iconic events in modern history were a joyfully chaotic affair			1
the then 20 - year - old daughter of the @entity28 , was a vivacious socialite who described the maids as the ' @entity2 of our day ' and explained each were chosen because of their lineage - the girls had to be the daughter of an @entity35 , @entity36 or @entity37 - and be unmarried			1
' we also had to have a certain type of look and figure			1
put it this way , we would n't have got picked if we were fat ! ' she laughed according to @entity45 there was barely any time to rehearse - and never in the @entity18 itself			1
' we had a few run - throughs with the @entity49 , who actually walked quite differently from the @entity5 - she walked much faster and we had to really pick up our pace in a hurry when we got to the @entity18			1
in the end we had just one rehearsal with the @entity5 at @entity54 , where she wore some kind of curtain wrapped around her waist to mimic her heavy robes , ' she recalled			1
lady @entity25 , left , and @entity59 , right , arrives at @entity18 today for a service to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the @entity62 the night before the @entity62 - which was held on june 2 1953 - the capital was so packed that @entity45 had to sleep on a mattress on her great - uncle 's floor			1
' i do n't think many people would have imagined that , ' she said			1
she added : ' on the morning we had our hair and make - up done because the event was being televised for the first time , but my hair was a disaster			1
' i had just had a perm done and they put these heated rollers in my hair			1
i was frazzled and looked like a sheep and was awfully upset			1
fortunately the hairdresser got to work and made me look half decent			1
' we dressed at @entity54			1
like the @entity5 our dresses were by @entity82 , but while they looked exquisite they were the most horribly uncomfortable things to wear and absolutely crushed our ribs			2
we were told to keep wriggling out toes to try and keep the circulation going			2
' lady @entity86 , left , and lady @entity87 and @entity88 , right , entering @entity18 lady @entity89 was one of the @entity5 's maids of honour at the 1953 @entity62 four of the more junior maids , including @entity45 , headed to @entity18 head of the @entity5 's arrival in the @entity95			1
' it was so exciting and we could hear the crowd roaring as the @entity5 approached			2
as she alighted we helped her out and smoothed her train			2
it was really quite cumbersome but had six invisible silk handles stitched into it			2
' i must say she looked quite ravishing , the dress was just beautiful			2
she had such a tiny little waist , wonderful porcelain skin and bright , sparkling eyes			2
' she turned to us and said : " ready , girls ? " and with that we were off			2
we were all a bag of nerves , but she was so calm it made us realised everything would be fine			2
' inside it was so spectacular , the most amazing thing i have ever seen			2
the colours , the music were just wonderful			0
remember we girls had lived through the war , which was just so gloomy			0
then we were suddenly transported into this wonderful tapestry that had come to life			0
' unfortunately half way through the service my dress was so tight that i began to faint			0
@entity123 [ a senior officer in the @entity125 ] was standing next to me and saw my legs buckle slightly , so held me up			0
we had smelling salt sewn into our gloves and i crushed my vial and wiggled my feet in an attempt to stay awake			0
' fortunately during the recess the archbishop of @entity133 came up and offered me a nip of brandy from a flask he had hidden in the @entity18			0
' @entity140 's @entity5 returned to the scene of her @entity62 today to mark a reign that has weathered six decades of social transformation and the end of her country 's global empire unlike the pomp and circumstance of the @entity62 itself , the reception at @entity54 was most definitely a family affair , with the young prince @entity151 and @entity152 running around and hiding under their mother 's voluminous dress			1
' when people ask you what the best moment of your life was , most say their wedding day			0
of course i remember that too			0
but the @entity62 was something exceedingly special			1
i was so lucky to be a part of it â€¦			0
. the roars , the excitement , ' she said			0
' after i had stood on the balcony with the @entity5 i went down to the crowds and listened to them calling for her			0
there were so many people , you could n't squeeze a pin between them			0
' and later that night there was another , far less decorous celebration			0
' my uncle had been asked to chaperone some of the visiting sheiks and i went out to nightclub with them until the early hours ! ' she recalled			0
the 60th anniversary ceremony remembering the @entity5 's 1953 @entity182 was held in @entity18 today and attended by all six maids of honour asked what she thinks the secret to the @entity5 's six remarkable decades on the throne is , @entity45 , now 79 , who went on to marry @entity188 , the 3rd @entity189 , sums it up in one word : duty			1
' i often discussed it with her sister , @entity193 , for whom i became a lady - in - waiting , and she told me that was what they were brought up to expect			1
the queen was raised to give her life to her country , ' she said			0
she continued : ' @entity5 has behaved impeccably over the years and i think people realise that			0
' she is actually a very modest person to be around and i think the celebrations this year and those to come have made people realise what a tremendous debt of thanks we owe her as a nation			0
' i remember very distinctly watching her in the @entity18 as she was being anointed , she had stripped off her regalia and stood there in her simple white shift			0
it made her look very vulnerable , a young woman with the weight of her world on her shoulders			0
' then the years of training kicked in			0
i feel thrilled 60 years later to have played a small part in that remarkable day			0
