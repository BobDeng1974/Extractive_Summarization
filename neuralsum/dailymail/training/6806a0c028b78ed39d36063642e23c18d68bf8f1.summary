the elderly and disabled are being ‘ put up for auction ’ by local councils on ‘ @entity4 - style ’ websites , with care firms then bidding to offer them a bed			1
at least a dozen local authorities are listing vulnerable people ’s details – including their age and what care and medication they need – before inviting bids from care homes in the area			1
the bidding is sometimes open for only a few hours , at other times it can last for two or three days			0
the cheapest offer often wins			1
cattle market : at least a dozen councils are listing vulnerable people ’s details – including their age and what care and medication they need – on @entity4 - like software and inviting bids from local care homes ( file photo ) critics last night said the system was akin to ‘ auctioning your granny ’ and a ‘ cattle market ’ , saying sensitive decisions about an elderly resident ’s final years are being made by a computer programme that is only interested in costs			1
it also means the patient or their family often does not see the care home , and that those running the home do not see the patient before they arrive			0
one council has boasted of reducing care costs by almost a fifth using the system			2
the auction - style process allows councils to circulate anonymised details of individuals to a large number of suppliers who then bid in an online auction for the contract			1
as many as 100 providers can bid before the software produces a shortlist of the most favourable bids			2
shortlisted bidders are then told where they are ranked in the process			0
online : the system uses a software called @entity66 , which has been devised by @entity67 , a company based in @entity68 which last year said it was in talks with 30 other councils if they are in second position , they can adjust their bid – either by lowering the price or offering extra care services – so that they can move up to first			1
councils say quality is the first consideration , but figures obtained under a freedom of information request show 92 per cent of care packages commissioned on the system over a six - month period were awarded to the bidder with the lowest price , @entity79 5 @entity78 revealed			1
government adviser @entity89 : ' these @entity4 - style sites highlight the funding crisis for care ' @entity89 , a @entity93 adviser and independent expert on care for the elderly , said : ‘ these @entity4 - style sites highlight the funding crisis for elderly care			1
the idea of bidding for a person is just uncivilised			0
these are not parcels , they are people			0
’ @entity106 , chief executive of the charity @entity107 , said : ‘ do we really want to treat older people as a “ product ” to be bought and sold this way ? we are concerned that older people ’s needs will lose out to price as the main reason for selecting a home			0
’ at least 12 councils use the auction - style systems			1
they include @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity123 and @entity124			0
dozens more are expected to follow suit			0
care companies bidding to offer a place have to state what services they can provide and at what cost before a computer system decides which company is the winner of the ‘ contract ’			2
councils say the winning home is not forced upon patients , and that it is not always the cheapest bid that wins , with quality of care being the main consideration			1
@entity142 has been using an online auction system since 2012 and says it has reduced its spending on care by almost a fifth			2
it uses a software called @entity66 , which has been devised by @entity67 , a company based in @entity68 which last year said it was in talks with 30 other councils			0
@entity78 also found that in some cases in @entity142 elderly people were being sent to homes which won the online auction despite being ‘ zero - rated ’ by the council on its own 0 - 100 scale of care quality – where scores under 60 are ‘ poor ’			1
@entity158 , chairman of the @entity159 , which represents care homes in @entity142 and commissioned the @entity163 request , said the system was forcing providers to offer lower and lower prices to secure the contract			2
speaking out : @entity168 said her brother @entity169 , who had learning difficulties , was one persona affected ‘ this reverse tendering is something that compromises quality and undermines ethical practice , ’ he said			0
‘ if you are going to keep lowering the price , something has got to give			0
’ @entity178 , chairman of @entity179 , said : ‘ it ’s an absolute disgrace what is going on in @entity142			1
it is more like @entity184 cattle market than it is a caring service for the elderly			1
’ a @entity142 council spokesman said : ‘ the well - being of all our service users is paramount and we only award care packages to providers who are able to demonstrate that they can meet the needs of individuals			2
’ another critic of the system is @entity168 , whose brother @entity169 , 46 , has learning difficulties and had lived in the same care home in @entity203 for 28 years			0
when it closed , @entity122 circulated his details by emails to care homes which were then invited to bid to offer him a place			1
the details on the email included information about his ‘ mood and well - being ’ and medication			2
his family say other information which could easily identify him was also included			0
miss @entity168 , 44 , of @entity216 , said : ‘ we had no idea his details were being shared			0
this sort of tendering should be stopped			0

at least a dozen local authorities are listing vulnerable people ***'s*** details
ages and care needs including medication sent to up to 100 care firms
they pick which people to bid for - and cheapest offer nearly always wins
expert @entity89 : ' @entity4 - style ' system ' awful ' and ' just uncivilised '
health group leader : ' it ***'s*** an absolute disgrace - it ***'s*** like a cattle market '
