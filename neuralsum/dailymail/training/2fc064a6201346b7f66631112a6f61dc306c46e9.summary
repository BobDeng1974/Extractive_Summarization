but the @entity80 saw its application approved in just 28 days			0

@entity1 is a practicing @entity87 , but his embrace of militant @entity89 , including @entity9 – a @entity40 - designated terrorist organization – is curious because he has expressed a desire to run for president in @entity2 , a predominantly @entity92 nation			1
