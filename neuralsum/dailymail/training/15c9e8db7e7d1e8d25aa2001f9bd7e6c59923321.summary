@entity0 defiantly compared @entity2 powers with @entity3 yesterday as he defended his aggressive foreign policy			2
in a belligerent and provocative state - of - the - nation address , the @entity6 president accused the @entity8 of ‘ trying to build a new @entity9 ’			1
he claimed @entity6 was asserting its ‘ sovereignty and national pride ’ over its dealings with neighbouring @entity13 – and said his country ’s survival depended on it			1
we did not allow it			0
‘ @entity3 also failed when , with his hateful ideas , he was going to destroy @entity6 , throw us back behind the @entity38			2
everyone should remember how it ended			0
’ but while most of his audience looked on adoringly , @entity6 prime minister @entity23 , appeared to use the occasion to have a little snooze			1
@entity23 , who as a former president , has given state - of - the - nation speeches himself , was also spotted yawning as @entity0 insisted he would not change course despite the threat of diplomatic isolation			1
the comparison with the @entity49 leader may have been a reference to @entity52 ’s own attempt to compare mr @entity0 with @entity3 earlier this year			2
they also follow comments by @entity55 in may , in which he made comparisons between @entity3 and the @entity6 leader while visiting @entity59 veterans in @entity60 – sparking a furious reaction from the @entity62			0

the @entity6 leader insisted his country would not change course despite the threat of diplomatic isolation the speech was broadcast live across @entity6			1
@entity0 accused the west of ' pure cynicism ' over the @entity13 crisis in apparent reference to sanctions against his country yesterday mr @entity0 used his address to justify @entity6 ’s dealings with @entity13 and the annexation of @entity78 – which he described as ‘ our @entity79 ’ , a reference to the holy site in @entity83 sacred to both @entity84 and @entity85			1
more than 4,300 people have been killed in the conflict with separatists in eastern @entity13 , which the @entity8 and the @entity13 government say is fuelled by @entity6 arms and money			1
but mr @entity0 insisted that @entity6 was merely defending its own existence from foreign aggressors and warned : ‘ no one will succeed in defeating @entity6 militarily			2
’ he added : ‘ if for a number of @entity98 countries national pride is a long - forgotten term and sovereignty is too much of a luxury , for @entity6 real state sovereignty is an absolutely indispensable condition of its existence			0
‘ i want to stress : either we will be sovereign or we will dissolve in the world			0
and , of course , other nations must understand this as well			0
’ mr @entity0 then raised the spectre of a new @entity111 , saying : ‘ we will stand up for the diversity of the world			0
‘ we will deliver truth to people abroad ... and we will do this even in those cases when governments of some countries are trying to build around @entity6 something next to a new @entity9			2

he said : ‘ our army is modern and battle - worthy			0
as they say now , it is polite but menacing			0
we have quite enough power , will and courage to defend our freedom			0
’ striking a more liberal note in the speech , he also announced measures to spur the flagging economy , which has been hit by tough @entity2 sanctions over @entity6 ’s actions in @entity13 and is forecast to go into recession next year			1
