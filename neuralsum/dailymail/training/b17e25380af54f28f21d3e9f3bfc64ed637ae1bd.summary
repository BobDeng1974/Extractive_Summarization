@entity0 is most definitely an alien landscape , with its barren craters and huge mountains			1
however , researchers have now got a new insight into possibly its most bizarre region			0
known as ' chaos terrain ' , the areas have dozens or even hundreds of isolated mountains up to 2000 metres high scattered through them			1
the area has isolated mountains up to 2000 metres high scattered through it			1
seen from orbit , they form a bizarre , chaotic pattern			0
scientists believe that water in the form of ice was stored in cavities beneath the surface of the highlands early in the history of @entity0 ; this was then heated and thawed out			1
it was then placed under so much pressure that it escaped to the surface with great force through fissures and fault zones			0
as it flowed out , the water eroded the terrain and gradually left behind the striking landscape visible today			2
among the most interesting landforms on @entity0 are features referred to as ' chaotic terrain ' , the @entity46 , @entity14 's national aeronautics and space research centre , which created the video , said			1
dozens or even hundreds of isolated mountains up to 2000 metres high are scattered in these extensive regions			1
seen from orbit , they form a bizarre , chaotic pattern			0
such terrains are found over a large area to both the west and east of @entity58 , the largest canyon in the @entity59			2
@entity16 is a typical example of this type of landscape			0
this large basin , approximately the size of the @entity14 state of @entity15 , lies in the @entity0 highlands , near the equator			1
headwaters of large rivers that flowed from the highlands ' no comparable landforms are found on @entity72 , ' said @entity46			1
' scientists believe that water in the form of ice was stored in cavities beneath the surface of the highlands early in the history of @entity0 ; this was then heated and thawed out			1
' it was then placed under so much pressure that it escaped to the surface with great force through fissures and fault zones			0
the data used to generate these images and the simulated overflight were acquired by @entity94 's @entity93 spacecraft			0
the @entity95 ( @entity95 ) , operated by the @entity46 ( @entity46 ; @entity46 ) on board once again , image strips from orbit 18 – symbolically significant for the @entity95 scientists – were edited and used for the animations and images shown here			0
over 10 years ago , in january 2004 , @entity93 flew over @entity16 during orbit 18			0
this was the third time that the @entity95 camera had been switched on , and the images in the image strips , which were over 1000 kilometres long , were so spectacular that they were drawn on for publication of the first images from the successful @entity94 mission			0
to be able to show the western half of the @entity16 basin in a larger regional context , additional @entity95 images from subsequent orbits were used for the large image mosaic			1
the region shown is around 400 by 200 kilometres			0
' as it flowed out , the water eroded the terrain and gradually left behind the striking landscape visible today			2
' another factor supporting this theory is that many of the chaotic terrains on @entity0 are located at the head of large outflow channels , through which enormous quantities of water flowed out of the highlands towards the northern lowlands			1
the quantities of water that were first stored in @entity16 and then flowed northward through @entity131 must have been enormous			0
such terrains are found over a large area to both the west and east of @entity58 , the largest canyon in the @entity59			2
@entity16 is a typical example of this type of landscape ( inset ) they flowed away from a drainage area about 1500 kilometres in diameter , an area approximately the size of central @entity144			1
the @entity146 basin is 420 kilometres in diameter			2
it is thought to have formed a very long time ago – over three and a half billion years – during the @entity149 on @entity0			2
generation of the images and animations the images and animations were generated by the @entity153 and @entity154 at @entity155 , which was headed by @entity156 ( 1944 – 2014 ) from the beginning of the @entity93 mission .			0
