@entity0 started on the bench against @entity2 but the match still allowed him to renew an old acquaintance with @entity5			1
the pair 's mutual admiration is well documented and they swapped shirts after the infamous 4 - 1 @entity11 defeat in @entity12 2010			0
@entity0 was later pictured playing football in a public park in @entity15 wearing @entity5 's shirt			2
@entity0 started on the bench for the @entity19 champions against @entity2 the match still allowed the @entity22 midfielder to renew an old acquaintance with @entity5 @entity25 fever is yet to sweep through the @entity26			1
there might at least have been a capacity crowd for the visit of the 2013 winners but the build - up was distinctly flat , more akin to a @entity33 tie			0
@entity2 's grandiose pre-match film boasts of a ' thunderclap of noise ' which will greet the team			0
' @entity38 of polite applause ' would be nearer the mark			0
@entity2 fans have yet to embrace the @entity25 , which is evident from crowds at the @entity26 the most passionate the @entity2 fans do get is when the @entity25 anthem is played - which is roundly booed , adding to the sense of dislocation from the tournament			1
it seems the grievances with @entity51 's financial fair play regulations and the perceived injustice over the @entity54 fan ban in @entity55 - which saw locals manage to breach the prohibition of fans - still runs deep			0
the most passionate the @entity2 fans get is when the @entity25 anthem is played - which is booed @entity2 and @entity61 clubs can only look on enviously as @entity22 plan their month - long winter break , with a holiday followed by a @entity65 training camp			1
meanwhile , @entity2 contemplate games against @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 and the @entity72 third round in a two - week spell			2
one of these nations is the second-most successful @entity76 football team of all time ; the other is @entity11			0
@entity2 will face @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 while @entity22 prepare for their winter break			1

@entity2 beat @entity22 3 - 2 at the @entity26
@entity0 started on the bench for the @entity84 champions
@entity2 fans still seem yet to fully embrace the *competition*
