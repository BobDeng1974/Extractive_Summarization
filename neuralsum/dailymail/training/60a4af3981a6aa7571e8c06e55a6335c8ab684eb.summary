by @entity0 published : 12:46 est , 12 march 2014 updated : 16:05 est , 12 march 2014 @entity3 manager @entity2 spent £ 32million in eight days to bring the pair of them to @entity6 to strengthen his title bid - and so far the plan is working			1
since £ 21m was spent bringing @entity10 midfielder @entity9 back to his former club , @entity3 are unbeaten in their eight @entity13 games , winning six , and have opened up a seven point gap at the top of the table			1
crucially , in a tricky run of games for the @entity19 , @entity9 has been a key part in important wins over @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25			1
£ 11m @entity27 @entity26 may not be having the same impact at the moment , but the flying winger has shown huge potential in his three brief appearances			1
he combines brute strength with intelligence and class on the ball and has earned rave reviews , especially for the way he out - played @entity63 in that win at the @entity65			2
his performance that night earned him the nickname ' @entity68			0
' ' i saw something on the internet which said this about me , ' says the 25 - year - old in @entity74			0
' it ’s very nice if the people think this about me because it would be a good nickname to have			0
i have to be like this because i play in a position where you have to be the beast ! ' of course , i am always very happy when people have nice things to say about me , and it ’s a pleasure if they like the way i play			0
i wanted to show my quality and i know it was important to start well because that helped me to feel more comfortable			0
' the beast : @entity9 earned rave reviews for his brilliant performance against @entity63 at the @entity65 pedigree : @entity26 scored three goals in four matches against @entity3 in the last two seasons @entity26 has played just 60 minutes of football in west @entity98 but has shown his pedigree against @entity3 in recent seasons , with three goals in four appearances against them in his last two seasons			1
the @entity27 is excited to be playing in @entity105 and has memories of watching @entity3 as a teenager			1
' as a boy , i watched every @entity111 game on the tv and saw many , many good players , ' he says			0
beast : @entity9 enjoys mixing it up with his opponents in his defensive midfield roles @entity118 fought : @entity9 battles with @entity120 during @entity3 's 4 - 0 win over @entity25 on saturday ' i remember watching @entity3 play against @entity122 in the @entity111 – a 4 - 4 draw but @entity3 went through			1
' it was a really great game and it has been my dream to play in @entity105 – the @entity27 people want to see players in the @entity13 and now they will see me playing at @entity3 , so there is more pressure on me			1
' i hope i can now start to score for @entity3 , not against @entity3 , ” he adds			2
' i know it will not be easy to play every game for @entity3 because we have so many very good players in my position , but i hope to show how hard i work and then we will see			2
' spell away : @entity9 spent three years at @entity34 before returning to @entity3 @entity9 , of course , has taken an odd route to the @entity3 first team			1
after joining the @entity19 in 2009 from @entity139 team @entity138 , he stayed at @entity6 for two years making three appearances before moving as part of the deal that brought @entity143 to the club			1
he flourished in @entity145 , helping the @entity147 giants to the @entity149 cup and leading them to the @entity151 final , where they were beaten by @entity3			2
his performances in the midfield won him the @entity145 @entity156 award			0
@entity9 acknowledges that leaving @entity3 may have been the best thing for him			1
' i feel different than i felt three years ago , ' he says			0
' i always believed i had the right qualities and style of play for the @entity13			0
maybe if i stayed at @entity3 , i do n’t play like i do now – maybe i play better , maybe i play worse , you never know			2
' i learned a lot at @entity34 , which is one of the biggest clubs in the world ; not only how to play that central - midfield position , but i learned to play with pressure			0
' now it is very nice to be back			0
it ’s a pleasure to be part of this team and to work with these players and coaches			0
all the people have been helping me since i came back and i ’m very happy			0
' @entity3 continue their title charge with a visit to @entity178 on saturday evening			2
