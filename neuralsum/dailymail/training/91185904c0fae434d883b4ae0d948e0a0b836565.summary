by @entity0 @entity1 : @entity2 : @entity3 : 14 it 's the time when people start talking about awards , but there is no question @entity9 should win the double			1
@entity1 has been magnificent and @entity11 is a class act			0
they are the player and manager of the year			0
@entity9 had success under @entity17 and @entity18 , but never played with the same style as @entity11 ’ side			1
that is an incredible turnaround			0
@entity47 said it would be good for neutrals if @entity9 won the title , but it would be great for @entity51 full stop			1
they play such fantastic football with a @entity55 manager and sunday had six @entity56 in their starting @entity57 @entity1 and @entity11 should win the individual awards , but they will want to make it a magnificent treble with the title			0
mourinho on the defensive you would expect @entity35 to play two defensive midfielders against @entity33 , but it was a surprise to see @entity65 do it against @entity66			1
he was without the suspended @entity68 , and playing @entity69 made sense because he is cup - tied for wednesday ’s @entity72 game , but @entity73 will have been pleased to see @entity74 and @entity75 on the bench			1
no hope ? @entity65 believes his @entity39 side stand no chance of pipping @entity33 or @entity80 to the title defensive : @entity83 ( left ) and @entity69 ( right ) both started at @entity66 for @entity39 starting @entity69 and @entity83 played into @entity66 ’s hands			1
they relished the midfield battle rather than having to deal with @entity39 ’s smaller playmakers , and @entity88 was so strong			1
the result showed it ’s not just big head - to - heads that can win you the title			2
of the top three , only @entity9 have not lost a game to one of the bottom five			2
@entity95 a special mention to @entity98 ’s @entity97 , who set a @entity100 record on saturday			1
after a 0 - 0 draw with @entity102 , @entity97 has gone 24 games without defeat , the most by a new boss			1
with @entity98 second in @entity107 , he could be extending that in @entity109 next season			2
hard to beat : @entity97 has gone 24 games undefeated as @entity98 manager @entity112 would love @entity113 @entity114 are doing their part to keep up the @entity117 revival			1
@entity118 is another exciting manager who has his team playing good , stylish football			0
with another win , next week ’s game against @entity35 is now massive			2
finishing in the top four and qualifying for the @entity72 would be so important for them			0
cruising : @entity124 and @entity114 brushed relegation candidates @entity125 aside at @entity127 licence to thrill : @entity118 is an exciting young manager lighting up the @entity32 here to stay ? @entity131 ( left ) and @entity132 , on loan from @entity39 and @entity33 respectively , are two members of @entity118 's impressive @entity114 squad to have dazzled at @entity135 this season a lot of their success this season has been built on loans — @entity131 , @entity132 , @entity141			1
and with @entity72 money in the bank , they might just be able to make the signings permanent			0
@entity35 's main middle man when @entity35 lost 6 - 0 to @entity39 , @entity147 spent the first half on the bench			1
by the time he came on , his side were 4 - 0 down			0
pegged back : @entity147 rallies his @entity35 team - mates after equalising for the @entity153 at home fighter : @entity147 was @entity35 's stand - out performer against @entity33 at the @entity157 @entity147 covered more ground than any other player at the @entity157			1
@entity162 , at 32 the oldest midfielder on the pitch , was second			0
@entity147 : @entity163 : 6.9 against @entity33 , he gave the midfield the legs they needed			1
he ruffled a few feathers , too , nicking a goal and providing energy			0
@entity162 is a good playmaker , but looks much better with @entity147 alongside him			2
against @entity39 , their attacking midfielders closed @entity162 then sprang off the back of him and @entity35 could n’t cope			1
@entity147 helps close things up against powerful midfields , and there is none more powerful than @entity33 ’s			2
for years @entity35 have struggled against stronger sides because they are not good enough without the ball			0
is @entity147 the long - term solution ? no , but , with him in the side , @entity35 look a much more solid outfit			1
grafting : @entity162 ( right ) also covered a lot of ground against @entity33 at the @entity157 @entity184 's laughing now when he turned up in the @entity186 car park looking for a transfer , @entity184 was a bit of a laughing stock , but now he ’s proving his quality			0
he has scored in three games in a row and @entity193 have won them all			0
he works well with @entity195 and , with his side playing good football , @entity198 could lead @entity193 to their first top - 10 @entity32 finish			2
they played brilliantly at @entity201 last weekend and have a great home record — eight wins and just two defeats			0
easily done : @entity184 ( right ) celebrates his winner against @entity206 on saturday @entity207 @entity208 is now fourth in the all - time @entity32 scorers list			2
he is four goals away from @entity211 and 16 off @entity212 , but can he beat @entity213 ’s 260 ? at this rate , @entity2 would have to play for seven more seasons to get there			0
it ’s not impossible for somebody of his quality			0
@entity221 : @entity208 rifles home from the penalty spot against @entity201 on saturday			0

@entity9 were 28 points off @entity32 title last season
now @entity230 club are two points clear at the summit
@entity39 played into @entity73 ' hands with two defensive midfielders
@entity147 gives @entity35 much - needed *stability* in midfield
@entity240 , a special mention for @entity98 boss @entity97
