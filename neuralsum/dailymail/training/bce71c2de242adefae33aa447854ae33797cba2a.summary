the fashion industry often comes under fire for promoting a one - size - fits - all idea of beauty with some brands only using models of a certain height and weight for their campaigns			0
@entity9 , however , is proving a point with its spring / summer 2015 campaign , which aims to promote ' tolerance , equality and unconditional love '			1
the star of the new shoot is , without a doubt , 19 - year - old @entity18 who has vitiligo , a pigment condition that causes white patches to form on skin			1
she was cruelly nicknamed ' zebra ' and ' cow ' because of the white patches covering her face and body growing up			1
@entity41 famously had the same condition and explained his pale complexion was a result of the lack of melanin in his skin			1
now @entity18 , who describes her self as a ' vitiligo spokesmodel ' on @entity50 , is being celebrated for her distinctive look			1
she has hundreds of thousands of followers on social media and she was recently invited back to her high school to do a motivational talk with students touching on the discrimination she faced			0
@entity18 first spoke publicly about her skin condition in 2011 by posting a video to @entity61 titled ' @entity62 : a skin condition not a @entity64 '			2
@entity18 , far right , was diagnosed with vitiligo around the age of four and said growing up she was cruelly nicknamed ' zebra ' and ' cow ' but she 's launched a hugely successful career conceived by creative director @entity71 and styled by @entity72 , the new @entity9 campaign aims to be provocative and optimistic , say the brand although then just 17 , she eloquently told viewers : ' people have black skin , people have brown skin , i have both			1
' when i got older , it got harder because when kids get older they get meaner , so i went through a lot of bullying and people calling me like zebra or cow so it was really hard growing up			0
' she said at certain points she was plagued with suicidal thoughts but found the strength to pull through			0
moving from @entity91 to @entity92 with her family also provided the opportunity for a fresh start			0
speaking about the campaign , which also stars @entity97 , front , @entity71 said : ' the challenge was to work with an avant - garde photographer , @entity101 , and get him to do something he 's rarely done - which is shoot people smiling ' after ' blossoming ' , @entity18 said she found it strange when people started telling her how beautiful she was			1
' i 'll turn pink and say " thank you so much , ' " the teenager giggled			0
@entity62 occurs when the cells that produce melanin , the pigment that determines the color of skin , die or stop functioning			2
this causes slowly enlarging white patches of irregular shapes to appear on the skin over time			1
@entity62 affects all races , but may be more noticeable in people with darker skin			2
the exact cause of the condition is unknown , although many experts believe that it is an autoimmune condition in which the body 's immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys certain cells			2
there is no cure and the goal of treatment , which can include ointments and skin grafts , is to stop or slow the progression of pigment loss			2
she says that things have worked in her favour because she accepts her originality and has used it to her advantage			0
and with that , opportunities start to fall into my lap. and i thank @entity146 for all of them			0
try loving yourself , ' she concluded			0
as well as starring on @entity33 , she walked in @entity151 's catwalk show in @entity152 and starred in a @entity154 campaign			1
this @entity9 campaign is the latest string to her bow			2
conceived by creative director @entity71 and styled by @entity72 , the campaign aims to be provocative and optimistic , inspiring people to live life in the moment and to enjoy the ride			0
speaking about the campaign , which also stars alternative model @entity164 , @entity71 said : ' there are so many crazy things happening now that you do n’t see people just having fun any more			1
' the challenge was to work with an avant - garde photographer , @entity101 , and get him to do something he ’s rarely done - which is shoot people smiling			0
' it feels spontaneous , like they are selfies and he ’s just the one snapping the photo			0
' @entity18 has suffered with vitiligo , which causes white patches to on skin , since she was around four years old , left , but despite her different appearance she appeared on @entity33 ( right )			1
