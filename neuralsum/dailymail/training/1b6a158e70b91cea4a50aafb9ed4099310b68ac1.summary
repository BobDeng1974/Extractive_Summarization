the scientist who discovered hepatitis c in 1989 says he has now created a vaccine against the liver - destroying virus			1
@entity4 , from the @entity5 , said the vaccine was developed from a single strain but is effective against all known strains of the disease			1
dr @entity4 started working on the project 10 years ago while he was working for the drug company @entity11			2
dr @entity4 ( left ) discovered hepatitis c in 1989			1
this electron micrograph ( right ) shows hepatitis virions , which cause the virus the disease has caused a ' silent epidemic ' in western countries			1
figures published yesterday by the @entity20 revealed more people died as a result of @entity23 than from aids in the @entity25 in 2007			1
' one of every 33 baby boomers are living with hepatitis c infection , ' said @entity20 's dr @entity29			1
left untreated it can cause scarring of the liver and ultimately to life - threatening cirrhosis			1
the @entity25 figures revealed there were 15,000 deaths related to the condition in 2007 - three - quarters of whom were middle aged			1
the condition is unpredictable - while some may live with the condition their whole lives with only mild symptoms , others can develop serious liver disease even with treatment			1
@entity23 literally means the inflammation of the liver			2
it is usually caused by a virus , although alcohol excess can also be to blame			2
the most common types of liver inflammation and infection are @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56			2
. @entity54 is spread by eating contaminated food or drinking water			2
it 's most common in countries with poor hygiene standards			2
there is a @entity63 is usually passed on by exposure to infected blood			0
in developing countries it is mostly passed from mother to baby			0
in developed countries it 's spread through sex and sharing drug needles			0
it is 100 times more infectious than @entity75 , yet there is a vaccine to prevent @entity78 is also a ‘ blood borne ’ virus			0
it can be passed on through sexual contact but is most commonly shared through sharing drug needles			0
there is no @entity84 people recover from hepatitis a with no lasting liver damage but @entity55 can cause long term liver disease , leading to cirrhosis and even liver cancer			1
in many cases there are no early warning symptoms until liver damage is advanced			2
source : the @entity96 there is currently no vaccine in use to prevent infection in the first place			0
but , speaking at the @entity102 in @entity103 yesterday , dr @entity4 revealed his team is just five years away from creating a useable vaccine			0
dr @entity4 and his co-investigator @entity106 discovered that they could use a single strain of the virus to draw out broad cross-neutralising antibodies against all the different major strains			0
' this tells us that a vaccine made from a single strain can indeed neutralize all the viruses out there , ' he said			0
' it really encourages the further development of that vaccine			0
this is a really a big step forward for the field of @entity124 vaccinology			0
' hundreds of thousands of people are infected with hepatitis c annually around the world , with between 20 to 30 per cent developing some form liver disease			1
however , dr @entity4 cautions that further testing is required , meaning that it may be five to seven years before the vaccine receives approval			0
he added that while it may make some difference in those currently suffering from hepatitis c , the vaccine will mainly be a preventative measure against acquiring the disease			1
@entity139 , director of the @entity140 at the @entity5 , said : ' we have a long way to go , but this is a great step			0

up to 30 per cent of hepatitis c sufferers develop liver disease
more people died as a result of hepatitis c than from aids in the @entity25 in 2007
