but fashion designer @entity3 does n't want daughter @entity4 growing up too quickly			1
a mother for the fourth time with husband @entity8 , the 39 - year - old fashionista is so wary about 22 - month - old @entity4 picking up on her actions that she avoids putting on beauty products around the toddler to ensure she does n't feel left out			1
she said : ' i ca n't put on make - up when @entity4 's around , because she would join me immediately			1
she is a tomboy towards her brothers			2
' @entity3 , pictured at a football game with @entity4 in @entity17 last saturday , ' ca n't put make - up on around her ' @entity3 admits she is aware of the pressure her children - also including three sons @entity23 , eight , @entity24 , 10 , and @entity25 , 14 - are under while having famous parents , but makes sure they know they can do good with their celebrity status and does n't spoil them			1
' [ @entity23 asked ] ' why is it good to be famous , mum ? ' my answer was , ' when you 're famous you have a certain power to do good things , ' she told @entity35			2
' that is how we started talking about charity			2
@entity23 was really sweet and said , " when people listen to what i say , i could spread some good messages "			0
' the kids are under a lot of pressure to perform			0
i do n't want to pressure them			1
they should be keen and reach as much as possible			0
but the most important thing is they are happy			0
mummy 's little girl : always on @entity8 or @entity3 's arm , @entity4 is still a tomboy according to @entity3 ' they lead a very privileged life but they do n't get everything they ask for			1
we always tell them how lucky they are			0
' @entity24 has begun to make a name for himself in the fashion world like his mother , modelling for label @entity64 , and while he enjoined the experience , @entity3 has no plans to force him back			1
she said : ' i asked if he wanted to do [ modelling ] and he said , ' sure , sounds fun '			0
and he really had a lot of fun			0
will he do it again ? i do n't know			1
he 's more interested in school and sports right now			0
