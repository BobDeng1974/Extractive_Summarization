the @entity1 planted ¿ spies ¿ who listened to the private conversations of the mother of a rape victim who made a complaint against a doctor , it has been claimed the @entity1 planted ‘ spies ’ who listened to the private conversations of the mother of a rape victim who made a complaint against a doctor , it has been claimed			1
plainclothes security guards were employed to shadow the woman at the fitness - to - practice hearing , where she accused the doctor of missing signs that her disabled daughter had been raped at a boarding school			1
during the hearing , the guards told the woman they were on ‘ work experience ’ for the @entity1			1
they followed her into meetings with lawyers and even into the lavatories , ministers last night demanded an urgent investigation into the doctors ’ regulator , which has now admitted hiring non-uniformed guards during fitness - to - practice hearings where doctors are charged with serious professional misconduct			1
the @entity1 said that it did so only to ensure ‘ there was no risk of disruption to proceedings ’			1
it added that an unnamed security firm had signed a confidentiality clause to ensure information was not inappropriately shared			0
but while the doctor , his solicitor and the @entity1 panel of experts were all told about the covert arrangement , neither the mother nor her legal team were informed			1
last night , mps and lawyers expressed dismay at the @entity1 ’s secret policy , which , they said , could have potentially prejudiced this and other cases			2
health minister @entity56 said : ‘ it is very hard to understand how it can be right to have security guards present , known about by everyone except the complainant			1
‘ that does n’t sound like proper justice and inevitably raises the concern that privileged information is reported back to the other side			0
’ the @entity1 said the covert policy had been used since 2007 and 16 times in the last three years – meaning tens of cases have been potentially prejudiced			2
the mother , identified only as @entity72 under a @entity74 ruling , attended a four - day hearing in december when two non-uniformed people walked into the room where she and a female lay representative were discussing the case			2
she said : ‘ there was a young girl and an older man			0
they said they were on work experience with the @entity1 and following people in different departments			1
i believed them , we spoke to them casually and thought no more of it			0
‘ when i spoke to my barrister on the phone , one of them was there and one of them overheard a conversation i was having with my gp			0
last night , mps and lawyers expressed dismay at the @entity1 ¿ s secret policy , which , they said , could have potentially prejudiced this and other cases ( file photo ) ‘ i actually feel violated			2
it is unforgivable and inexcusable			0
how many other people has this happened to ? ’ @entity72 , who only discovered the deception last month during disclosure in another aspect of the case , added : ‘ they spied on us			0
they listened to conversations we would never have had if we had known			0
’ @entity116 , @entity72 ’s barrister , said the @entity1 could face a misfeasance in public office charge and that the policy might have breached the @entity120 , adding she and @entity72 were followed under the same ruse at a one - day hearing in the same case last august			1
she said : ‘ the guards were constantly hanging about whether we were going to the loo or the coffee machine , and while i was n’t present at the december hearing , my client was calling me with a lot of privileged information			2
i am astounded i was lied to and ca n’t believe anybody behaved like that			0
‘ what message does it give to the adjudicating panel that it is necessary to police the victim ’s mother ? ’ @entity1 chief executive @entity139 said it had written to the mother to apologise and will ‘ reflect on lessons to be learned ’			1
he added : ‘ we will report back to her on the actions we have taken to make sure this does not happen again			0
