recalled paceman @entity0 took four wickets as @entity2 dismissed a wasteful @entity3 for 213 runs at the @entity5 on friday , boosting the co-hosts ' hopes of a @entity8 semi-final with @entity10			1
@entity0 , replacing seamer @entity11 , combined with left - armer @entity12 to remove @entity3 's openers cheaply and returned to punch a hole through the @entity17 team 's middle - order on a sun - drenched autumn day			1
part - time spinner @entity19 took two wickets and @entity22 three catches at deep midwicket , as captain @entity24 and two other @entity3 right - handers gave up their wickets on a platter when attempting to clear the short boundary			1
@entity24 won the toss and opted to bat first but the move backfired with openers @entity32 and @entity34 both out within three balls before the sixth over			0
@entity32 , on 10 , edged a quicker ball from @entity12 to @entity38 who took a fine , low catch diving to his right in the slips			0
@entity0 ( 4 - 35 ) then struck to remove @entity34 for five , the opener edging behind to @entity2 captain @entity43			1
@entity24 was nearly out for a duck two balls later when the ball brushed his stump after clipping his thigh pad , but the bails stayed intact			0
he and number three batsman @entity50 battled to steady the innings and the @entity3 skipper smashed @entity19 over the fence twice			2
but @entity19 had the last laugh , breaking the 73 - run partnership when @entity24 miscued a slog - sweep straight to @entity58 in the 24th over			0
the writing was on the wall when @entity61 had @entity50 out for 41 soon after , following up a venomous bouncer with a wide , fuller delivery to the left - hander who sent a leaden - footed edge to wicketkeeper @entity66			0
infuriatingly for @entity3 fans , @entity69 ( 20 ) and @entity70 ( 23 ) repeated their captain 's horrid dismissal , holing out to @entity58 on the rope off the bowling of @entity19 and @entity75 respectively			2
that left @entity3 reeling at 158 - 6 , but paceman @entity77 added 30 runs with @entity79 before the middle order batsman slashed @entity75 straight to @entity61 at cover to be out for 29			2
@entity77 was out a few balls later for 16 , nicking @entity12 behind to @entity66 , before @entity83 sent a top - edge from a @entity75 ball soaring high into the sky before landing in the wicketkeeper 's gloves			0
@entity3 's tailenders nudged their team past 200 before all - rounder @entity91 had a slogging @entity92 caught for 15 on the penultimate ball of the allotted overs .			1
