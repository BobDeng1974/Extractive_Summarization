@entity0 , left , pictured with her former rugby international husband @entity1 , right , shamed a @entity3 troll who told her to go back to the kitchen her father was an international footballer and she is married to a former rugby star			1
so when a troll tweeted that she should be a housewife rather than a tv sports presenter , @entity0 was on safe ground hitting back			1
she promptly named and shamed the man who described her a ‘ f * * * ing geezer bird ’ – and was swamped with praise by her followers			2
yesterday mrs @entity0 , 41 , retweeted the sexist message , which appeared to have been sent to her by a web designer named @entity17			1
it appears he hurled his abuse after mrs @entity0 tweeted her thoughts about football			2
writing using the @entity3 handle @ @entity23 he said : ‘ who asked your opinion f * * * * * * geezer bird get back to kitchen ” this is freelance web designer and latent feminist @entity30 ’			1
within minutes , scores of mrs @entity0 ’s 372,000 followers had applauded her for drawing attention to the troll , who has since deleted his profile			1
among them was @entity38 , partner of fellow @entity40 presenter @entity39 , who wrote : ‘ name and shame @entity0 ! ! good on you			2
’ mrs @entity0 , whose father @entity41 was a @entity42 international footballer and was part of the presenting team covering the @entity45 in @entity46 , replied : ‘ occasionally you just need to deliver a little upper cut for your own sanity do n’t you think ? ’ and hundreds of other @entity3 users offered their support to mrs @entity0 , with one writing : ‘ @entity0 you are great , do n’t worry about these silly people who do n’t think before they speak			1
others pledged to avoid working with the designer , including one who tweeted : ‘ any of my suppliers who use @ @entity58 will lose business			0
’ another posted : ‘ good luck with your female colleagues tomorrow			0
learn a bit of class from @entity0			2
’ last night @entity72 of campaign group @entity71 said : ‘ i ’m really pleased that she ’s in a position to be able to fight back about it			0
we hear lots of stories about people not in that position and some of them end really tragically			0
we are still navigating our way through the challenges that social media present but actually being abusive like that on @entity3 is no different to publishing it anywhere else			1
he clearly should have thought twice before pressing the button that says publish , because that is exactly what he ’s done			0
’ it is not the first time mrs @entity0 , who is the wife of former @entity86 rugby star @entity85 , has used social media to name and shame a troll			1
last month she shared a sexist remark from @ garywall001 , which read : @ @entity91 you ’re s * * * on @entity92 [ @entity92 ] get some ironing done , ’ and wrote : ‘ the thing is i am a woman so i can do both			0
’ in the past she has also voiced annoyance to be repeatedly asked ‘ who is looking after the children ’			0
mrs @entity0 , who is mother two nine - year - old twins @entity99 and @entity100 , told @entity102 magazine : ‘ people still think it ’s a woman ’s responsibility to organise everything			1
when i was away , some of the mums at school asked @entity1 how he was coping			0
no one asked me that when he was working in @entity111 last year			0
i ’m often asked who ’s looking after the children when i ’m away , yet my male colleagues are n’t			0
’ mrs @entity0 ’s @entity3 came after @entity115 was celebrated on sunday			1
earlier this month she hosted a discussion at breakfast networking event for the campaign , in aid of the domestic violence charity refuge			0
@entity0 , left , pictured with her father , former @entity42 international @entity41 , said she needed to respond to the insulting tweet ' to deliver a little upper cut for your own sanity do n’t you think ? ’			2

twitter user @ *glenweblondon* *allegedly* attacked @entity0 *online*
the tweet claimed that ms @entity0 ' should get back to the kitchen '
the 41 - year - old presenter retweeted the message to her 372,000 followers
the alleged @entity3 troll has since deleted his social media account
