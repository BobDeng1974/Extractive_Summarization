by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 08:53 est , 18 july 2013 updated : 04:24 est , 19 july 2013 @entity2 has become the latest firm to have a global tax avoidance scheme thrown out as the @entity5 claimed £ 1billion has been clawed back already this year			1
the shipping and logistics firm , the parent company of @entity8 and among other maritime business , was accused of an ‘ elaborate trick ’ in using a complex scheme to get an extra £ 14 million in tax relief			1
it came as ministers said a tax avoidance clampdown had protected £ 1billion in court battles with international firms trying to avoid paying their way in @entity19			1
all at sea : the tax avoidance scheme by @entity22 , which owned @entity8 , dated back to 2004 and was described by a tribunal as ' elaborate trick ' @entity25 successfully challenged the @entity2 scheme at a @entity27 , which ruled that the transactions were all part of an ‘ elaborate trick ’ designed to exploit the rules			1
the @entity27 said : ‘ it is clear that the scheme would only work so long as every participant in it was either a captive company or a stooge employee of a company within the @entity22			2
’ in its verdict it added that the scheme was ‘ designed and implemented for no reason other than tax avoidance ’			1
the scheme dates back to 2004 but @entity2 , which owned @entity8 , was bought by @entity44 in 2005 in a takeover deal worth £ 3.3billion			2
the legal battle had dragged on for nine years , although the laws being exploited by @entity2 were repealed in 2005 to stop other companies following suit			0
treasury minister @entity50 said @entity25 would continue to go after ' complex and intricate ' schemes today @entity50 , exchequer secretary to the treasury , said : ‘ i ’m delighted that @entity25 has successfully defeated this attempt by a major company to artificially reduce its tax bill by exploiting an extremely complex international financial structure			2
‘ the government has made it very clear that we wo n’t put up with aggressive tax avoidance and we have resourced @entity25 to take on even the most complex and convoluted schemes , as this @entity27 decision shows			1
’ a total of £ 154 million of tax was protected , the @entity5 said			1
however , @entity44 said it was filing an application for permission to appeal against the decision			0
a spokesman : ' this decision relates to a dispute between @entity2 and @entity25 about the double tax treatment of profits repatriated to the @entity19 in 2004 , before we acquired @entity2 in 2006			2
' this technical debate involves complex 2001 legislation that has now been repealed			0
' since the transactions took place there have also been changes to the corporation tax rules on dividends and distributions , with @entity82 and @entity25 recognising that the law was impractical and unfair , and any company can now repatriate profits from its subsidiaries abroad without giving rise to the problems in this case			0
in light of these facts , we have filed an application for permission to appeal the decision			0
' but mr @entity50 boasted that it was just the latest victory for @entity25 after also taking on corporate giants including @entity97 and the @entity99 and @entity98 in the courts			0
all of the firms claimed to be using legitimate schemes to whittle down their tax bills			0
but after being challenged , the court tax tribunal slapped down their arrangements , and the companies were forced to cough up the unpaid bills			0
mr @entity50 said : ‘ @entity25 has already topped £ 1bn in court wins against corporate tax avoidance this year			1
‘ schemes like this are complex and intricate , and without the technical skills , resources and commitment of @entity25 ’s specialists they would go unchallenged , costing the country billions of pounds every year			0
’ the biggest sum , around £ 600m , came from breakdown insurance group @entity119 , which was accused of trying to recover vat through a scheme that used two companies based in @entity124 .			2

firm used ' elaborate trick ' to get an extra £ *14million* in tax relief
@entity27 ruled it was designed for ' no reason other than tax avoidance ’
ministers say it takes corporate tax avoidance wins in 2013 to £ 1billion
