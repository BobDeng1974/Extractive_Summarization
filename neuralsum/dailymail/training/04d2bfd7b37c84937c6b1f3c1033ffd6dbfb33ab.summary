by @entity0 a cancer scare would be enough to make most of us rethink aspects of our lives but for 32 - year - old @entity5 , it provided the impetus she needed to transform it			1
despite a fulfilling career as a pharmacist , @entity5 had long dreamed of becoming a fitness model but had put her aspirations on the back - burner			1
then fate struck , when @entity5 was told she ran a high risk of developing cervical cancer after a doctor 's appointment			1
healthy : @entity5 ( right ) , who beat a cancer scare to become a model , poses with colleague , @entity20 the colposcopy , a treatment which involves having abnormal cells burned away , that followed left her with a month at home to fill while she recovered			1
and , incredibly , instead of sitting at home feeling sorry for herself , she used it to train for her first ever fitness modelling competition			2
' i had been given this massive health scare and i did n't want to wallow in my own misery , ' she explains			2
' i decided i was going to go after something i had wanted to do all my life			2
i have always had sly comments from girls about the way i look , they would say nice things to my face and then make horrible comments behind my back to try and knock my confidence			0
' letting people get the better of me was something i did n't want to do as i thought life was too short to listen to jealousy from people			2
' sporty : @entity5 , who is now a fitness model , has always enjoyed getting involved in sporting pursuits victory : @entity5 ( second from right ) is presented with her prize after becoming the @entity55 champion travel : @entity5 will now head to @entity57 where she will compete against models from all over the world all better : @entity5 says her cancer scare gave her the impetus she needed to pursue her modelling dreams and so with just five weeks to train , @entity5 entered a competition run by the @entity65 @entity64 , which she hoped would kickstart her fitness modelling career			1
to her complete surprise she was crowned the @entity55 champion			1
' i could n't believe that i won , i had n't trained for very long and did n't think i would even come runner - up let alone winner , ' she reveals			0
' there are all sorts of models at these contests - tall , short , plus size - but it 's all fine as long as you 're fit and healthy			0
' beauty comes from living a healthy life			0
clothes and make - up are just the icing on the cake			0
' with her homegrown triumph complete , @entity5 will now travel to @entity57 to compete against women from all over the world			1
' i had always been healthy and fit but then when i got the cancer scare it made me think you only live once and you have to follow your dreams , ' explains @entity5			1
' i had thought about doing modelling for some time but i was always scared that people would think i was vain when all i want to do is promote good health			0
' when i began to win at different modelling events i realised this was a really great way of being a spokeswoman for fitness and good health			0
' despite her travel plans and modelling success , @entity5 says she has no intention of giving up her day job			1
' even if i won the lottery , there 's no way i would give up this job , ' she explains			0
