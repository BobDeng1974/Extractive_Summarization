@entity23 : tennis world number four @entity0 stripped off for a magazine shoot the 24 - year - old is a proud @entity4 but youth group @entity28 ( @entity29 ) has condemned the shoot as ' immoral behaviour ' and dropped her from its campaigns			1
she had starred in a commercial for the group where she spells out ' @entity36 ' with tennis balls and tells people not to be ashamed of their faith			1
senior catholic priest father @entity40 said : ' it 's a shame that someone who has declared their love for @entity36 is now promoting the mentality of men looking at a woman as a thing rather than a child of @entity50 worthy of respect and love			2
' if she meets a man who she can truly love and establish a happy family and raise @entity4 children , then she would probably have to hide these pictures from relatives			0
' @entity8 is a strongly religious country with 90 per cent of the population describing themselves as @entity4			1
' immoral ' : the images have caused shock in her home country of @entity8 , where a @entity4 youth group have dropped her from their campaigns @entity67 4 : @entity68 got to the semi-finals of this year 's @entity2 but lost to @entity71 @entity70 faith : miss @entity0 is a proud @entity4 and has fronted a campaign urging young people not to be ashamed of their religion miss @entity0 normally keeps herself to herself despite being a sporting superstar in @entity8 , so the revealing images have sparked a media frenzy in the country			1

' and she said she liked to do 300 sit - ups at a time to make her stomach ' rock hard '			0
but she also admitted a weakness for fast foods , saying some of her favourite meals are ' @entity94 cheeseburgers or cheesecakes from @entity96			0
i am proud to say i have tried every single one ! ' diet : the star said she preferred sit - ups to the gym and had a weakness for @entity103 's and cheesecake she also revealed a strange habit of filling up on food around half an hour before her matches			2
' unlike most players , who eat at least two hours before matches , i can eat a full meal and go straight out on the court			0
in fact , i prefer to do that , '' she told the magazine			0
' my usual routine is a plate of pasta 30 minutes before i 'm due to go on court			0
if i do n't , i end up starving midmatch			0
that habit dates back to when my dad used to pick me up from school and drive me straight to matches			0
