millions of us were gripped by the exploits of the @entity3 family on the @entity5 special of @entity6 last night			1
in just three years , the trials and tribulations of the @entity10 gentry and their below - stairs staff have made the show one of the most popular period dramas ever made			2
but its success has also had a dramatic impact on the lives of those living inside the ‘ real ’ @entity6			1
family seat : lord and @entity21 of @entity22 , location for the television series @entity6 while the fictional @entity26 struggled to keep hold of his ancestral home , things have never looked better for the owners of @entity22 , where the @entity31 drama is filmed			1
before @entity6 hit our screens , the 8th @entity26 and @entity21 admitted their @entity35 estate needed £ 11.75million worth of repairs , including £ 1.8million of urgent work on the main house			1
ravaged by damp and rot , at least 50 rooms were uninhabitable and its stone turrets were falling into disrepair			2
but after their friend , writer and producer @entity47 , asked if he could film his new period drama at @entity22 , it has become one of @entity51 ’s best - known stately homes			1
as many as 1,200 visitors a day descended on the house in the summer , enabling the owners to begin major repairs			1
on the small screen : @entity22 in the background for a promotion photo for @entity31 's @entity6 @entity59 , 55 , said the show had ‘ taken the pressure off ’ for them financially			1
he said : ‘ at the time that we were approached about @entity6 , it was just after the banking crisis and it was gloom in all directions			1
we had been doing corporate functions , but it all became pretty sparse after that			2
‘ then @entity6 came along and we became a major tourist attraction			1
it has been a wonderful thing for us and our visitor numbers have doubled			2
’ redundant buildings have been turned into tearooms and a three - year project to fix those distinctive turrets is finally under way			2
the only man who might be disappointed by news of @entity83 ’s success is @entity84			2
when the composer heard the family needed money for repairs , he offered to buy the property to house his art collection			1
it was a move that still rankles with @entity21 , 48			2
‘ we were completely astounded , ’ she said			2
‘ i thought it was incredibly rude actually			2
it comes back to the old saying that an @entity97 ’s home is his castle			0
@entity99 [ the earl ] loves this house , we all do and it is not for sale			0
’ figures show the @entity105 ’ limited liability partnership @entity106 had cash assets of £ 329,685 for the year ending september 2011 , compared with just £ 121,118 for 2010			1
but @entity21 is not taking anything for granted			0
she said : ‘ any bit of money we make here goes back into making another set of curtains or something like that			1
if i wanted to have @entity120 shoes and a big flat in @entity121 then i would have married the wrong man , but if i want beautiful views and to walk through fields , then that ’s what @entity83 gives us			0
’ helping hand : the television series about the @entity3 family at @entity6 has given new life to @entity83 , boosting visitors numbers and allowed much needed repairs @entity83 , which has been home to the @entity21 family since 1679 , was redesigned by architect sir @entity136 in the 19th century after he finished work on the @entity138			1
yet it was not until 2009 , when the first series of @entity6 hit our screens , that it was propelled to international fame			1
today , it is used to promote @entity146 ’s campaign in the @entity147			0
the family moved into the main house from a cottage on the estate when the 7th @entity26 died in 2001			0
they now split their time between the two properties , leaving the main house during summer when it is open to the public			0
@entity21 said : ‘ it is not an ivory tower			0
it is lived in and we hope that makes it more interesting to visitors			0
’ extraordinarily , @entity21 says she has no idea how many rooms there are in their house			0
‘ i do n’t know ’ , she says			0
‘ the archivist said there are between 200 and 300 rooms and 50 to 80 bedrooms			0
’ she did start counting one day with her son and nephew , but lost count after 13 rooms			0
‘ we started at the top of the first tower and counted coming down but when we got to the bottom the boys were bored and it was their holidays so we abandoned it			0
’ for now , the @entity105 are too busy creating new business ventures to re-count the rooms			0
the series has led to a flurry of bookings for weddings and private events			1
@entity21 said : ‘ we are lucky that people love @entity6 at the moment and that we have had three series , but i do n’t think we take anything for granted			1
‘ i still wake up having a panic in the middle of the night about all sorts			0
i do n’t assume it stays around			0

@entity22 is the set for @entity31 's @entity6
the hype from the television series has funded £ 11.75 million of repairs
