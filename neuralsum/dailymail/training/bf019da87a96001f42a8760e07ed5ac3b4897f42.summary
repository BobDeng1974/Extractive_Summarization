by @entity0 last updated at 10:21 am on 3rd march 2012 @entity1 says the £ 3.7 million package she got is ' wholly inadequate ' to meet her needs the widow of a successful racehorse owner and trainer who died after jumping in front of a train is fighting her stepson for a bigger slice of her husband 's multi-million pound fortune			1
@entity1 , 50 , says the £ 3.7 million package she got - including the couple 's £ 2.5 million farmhouse home - is ' wholly inadequate ' to meet her needs			1
mrs @entity1 , of @entity17 , near @entity18 , says she and her husband , @entity19 , had an ' extremely high ' standard of living and she had devoted herself to him over 13 - and - a - half years of marriage			1
however , he was a manic depressive and heavy drinker , talked often of suicide and eventually killed himself under a train at @entity25 , near @entity26 , @entity27 , in 2006			0
he left behind his wife and a son from a previous marriage , @entity31 , as well as assets worth many millions of pounds , including his successful company , @entity33 although he had written a will leaving all but £ 25,000 of his estate to his wife shortly before his death , the document had not been properly witnessed and was invalid			1
it meant that his assets were divided up based on an earlier will which mrs @entity1 said did not make ' reasonable financial provision ' for her			1
the case reached the @entity43 last year , when judge @entity44 awarded her a lump sum and property worth about £ 1.2 million , on top of the £ 2.5m @entity49 home			0
but now she is challenging the decision , arguing that the judge took a wrong valuation of her husband 's oilfield supply company and did not award her enough to keep her financially secure			2
@entity57 , for @entity56 , told @entity59 judges , @entity60 , @entity61 and mr @entity62 , that the award was still not fair to the widow			0
he argued that judge @entity44 had wrongly based her decision on the value of the company being £ 8.3m , when in fact it also had dispersible cash reserves of £ 5.5m			0
it was also important that the judge take into account the lifestyle @entity56 had enjoyed before her husband 's death when deciding how much she needed in future			0
' as the authorities make clear , in the case of the widow of a wealthy man , which is the case here , where the estate can finance it , which it can in this case , reasonable financial provision means the provision of financial security for her throughout her remaining lifetime , ' he said			0
in effect , the judge had decided that - on top of the home , which no one disputed mrs @entity1 should have - another £ 1.2m was reasonable for her , he told the court			1
' the award made by the judge is wholly inadequate and , in any event , much or most of it will be required to pay mrs @entity1 's liabilities and will not provide any , or any sufficient , security for her			1
' the judge wrongly failed to understand that the lifestyle or standard of living enjoyed by @entity56 before @entity19 's death is something the court must have regard to when determining what amounts to reasonable financial provision for mrs @entity1			1
' late racehorse trainer @entity114 who died after falling in front of a train in 2006			1
his widow @entity117 , also pictured , is now fighting for a bigger slice of his estate mr @entity114 was a manic depressive and heavy drinker , talked often of suicide and eventually killed himself under a train at @entity25 , near @entity26 , @entity27 , pictured , in 2006 judge @entity44 herself had found their standard of living was ' extremely high ' , while mrs @entity1 had been cross-examined on the basis that it was ' luxurious ' , the @entity123 said			1
mrs @entity1 had also been a ' battered wife ' , who had given up her chance of a successful career of her own to be at her husband 's side , he continued			1
it meant she had sacrificed the chance to have her own children , since mr @entity114 did not want any more			1
' this was a case where @entity19 had serious problems , ' the barrister continued			0
@entity140 , one of the most successful horses in the string of the @entity143			0
many of mr @entity114 's racehorses ' names were given the ' @entity148 ' prefix associated with his company ' he was not an easy man to live with			2
he was a manic depressive , who was suicidal for many years			0
throughout the marriage , he was a manic depressive , violent , almost an alcoholic , who drank heavily			0
' mrs @entity1 clearly looked after him and clearly she had contributed to a certain extent , because he himself in the 2006 will decided to leave her all but £ 25,000			2
' the judge simply ignores her contribution			0
' the appeal judges rejected some of mrs @entity1 's grounds of appeal , but adjourned the question of whether the company was undervalued by £ 5.5 million			2
no date was set for the next hearing			0
mrs @entity1 's step - son , @entity31 , who is married with children and lives in the @entity173 , was not formally represented at the @entity174			2
many of mr @entity114 's racehorses ' names were given the ' @entity148 ' prefix associated with his company			2
he was best known for 1994 @entity179 and @entity182 winner @entity180 .			0

@entity1 says she and her husband had an ' extremely high ' standard of living
@entity114 had written a will leaving nearly all of his estate to her but the document had *n't* been properly *signed*
