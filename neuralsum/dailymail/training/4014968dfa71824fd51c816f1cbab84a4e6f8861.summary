by @entity0 the two characters that have set the @entity3 season alight are ideally drawn for dramatic effect : @entity6 @entity5 , the fastest driver of his generation yet emotionally vulnerable , against the @entity9 @entity8 , only a fraction slower but ice cool in his calculation			1
the stewards cleared @entity8 of deliberately thwarting @entity5 ’s final qualifying lap at the @entity15 by running off the track at @entity18 corner			1
@entity8 started from pole , won the race and took the championship lead off @entity5			1
but if @entity8 did know what he was doing — as many , though not all , paddock observers believe — it was a crime perpetrated with so much forethought and so immaculately executed that it is hard not to equate @entity8 to the sort of villain who strokes a white cat on his lap. frosty : @entity5 and @entity8 's relations were strained at a controversial @entity15 his answers to the press , and seemingly to the stewards , were more coolly convincing than @entity37 ’s in similar circumstances , when he ‘ parked ’ on the racing line in qualifying eight years ago to block @entity42 ’s crack at pole			1
@entity8 ’s father , @entity45 , who was world champion in 1982 , famously called @entity37 ‘ a cheap cheat ’ for his skulduggery			1
even more impressively , @entity8 refused to be ruffled by @entity5 ’s simmering anger at press conferences after qualifying and after the race			1
he said calmly that he and @entity5 are friends ; @entity5 said emphatically they were n’t			1
it may have irked @entity5 that his insinuations were met with serene indifference			2
@entity58 , in this instance , could not melt ice			0
they managed not to speak on the night of the race			2
@entity8 and his fiancee , @entity62 , left the gala dinner on sunday to arrive at the @entity64 at 1.15am to party with about 20 friends and 15 mechanics			1
they were briefly joined by @entity70 footballer @entity69 and ended the celebrations at breakfast time on the terrace at @entity74			0
@entity5 was also at the @entity64 , but his table was a diplomatically long way from @entity8 ’s			1
blanked : @entity5 and @entity8 did not talk to or look at each other on the podium in @entity79 contract : @entity8 leapfrogged @entity5 to the top of the standings after his win in @entity15 @entity8 clearly has a steeliness that belies the coiffured blond locks that won him the nickname @entity87 , as in @entity88 , from his fellow drivers			1
his manner with those of us he deals with on a professional basis is cordial but not matey			2
he is self - assured and self - possessed			0
interviewing him earlier in the season in the back of his @entity97 , i was twiddling with a pen and it snapped in my hand			2
he said : ‘ are you nervous ? ’ it seemed a typical @entity8 comment , a half - joke but one with a point			2
on that thursday , the first of the four - day grand prix weekend , he arrived early at the track			0
his driver parked up in an empty car park and @entity8 started work with his engineers , knowing his cerebral approach — he turned down a place to study engineering at @entity116 — offers the best , possibly the only , way to beat @entity5 to the title			1
feud : @entity5 was unhappy at the way @entity8 achieved his pole position on saturday @entity97 chairman @entity122 admitted as much , seeing in @entity8 ’s attention to detail something of his own approach			1
@entity5 he described as quicker and more naturally gifted			2
he is brilliant yet brittle			0
that is the view of a former karting rival of @entity5 and @entity8 , @entity130 @entity129 , formerly of @entity131 but now a test driver at @entity133			1
he has placed a bet on @entity8 winning the title on the basis the @entity9 has the mental fortitude that @entity5 lacks			1
@entity138 , possibly the best judge of a driver , said at the start of the season that he thought @entity8 would prevail			1
but @entity5 ’s former @entity143 team - mate , @entity142 , has backed his fellow @entity144 to recover for the next race in @entity146 a week on sunday			1
speaking from experience , he said : ‘ @entity5 would arrive at the next race after an upset very quiet , then go out and blitz it			1
he will do the same in @entity152 — he will probably be untouchable in @entity152			0
’ upset : during an interview after the race , @entity5 said he and @entity155 are not friends an important factor in deciding who wins the title is how @entity5 will fare without his father @entity160 ’s daily presence			1
he has not won a title at any level without him as his manager			2
he was the one person who would fight for his son against the world			0
in @entity160 ’s absence , @entity97 must make @entity5 feel loved if he is to perform at his best			2
that is not easy because when they put their two drivers on different strategies , and @entity5 perceives @entity8 ’s is the better one , his frustrations — paranoia even — could devour him			1
the other control @entity160 had over his son was in ensuring he was not distracted by off - track glamour : rappers , life in @entity178 , the red carpet			0
perhaps those factors have provided balance to @entity5 ’s life , made him more rounded and worldly , but there remains the possibility that he could be drawn too often to those sirens			2
much , therefore , falls on @entity122 , whose words after the race were refreshing			0
he knows he can not stop his drivers feuding — there is too much at stake for that — but he can draw a line which they must not cross			0
he has said they must be just about civil towards each other and not drive each other off the track			0
thirsty work : the @entity200 has won four of the six races this season , but still trails @entity8 in the drivers ' standings flashback : @entity5 and @entity8 together during their younger days this rivalry is precisely what @entity3 needed			1
suddenly it makes no odds that @entity97 are so far ahead because the championship fight is perfectly distilled into a mano a mano fight , with two - thirds of the season to go			0
one regret : the @entity217 did not show the @entity15 live , a deprivation for the casual , @entity220 audience			2
@entity221 show all races live , the @entity217 then pick the three races they most want to show live			0
they selected the @entity225 @entity15 , the @entity152 @entity15 — because it is at peak viewing time — and the last race , @entity228 , as it could be the title - decider			1
@entity221 then choose three races that they do not want the @entity217 to get their hands on			0
@entity234 , along with the other potential deciders , @entity231 and the @entity232 , were on that list			0
it is a shame because we have a 21st century answer to the @entity240 rivalry unfolding before us			0
@entity42 v @entity5 @entity42 , the champion , demanded no 1 status over @entity5 at @entity143 in 2007			2
@entity246 v @entity244 @entity247 called his 1986 and 1987 @entity249 team - mate ‘ an uneducated blockhead with a stupid and ugly wife ’			0
@entity254 v @entity252 the two star drivers regularly collided on the track			0
@entity257 said they made up before @entity258 died			0
@entity122 v @entity259 @entity122 was given the last rites after a crash in @entity263 ; he came back but lost the 1976 title in the final race			0
@entity268 v @entity266 the sporting rivalry			0
@entity270 campaigned not to have @entity271 disqualified in @entity272 and lost the title to him by a point .			0

@entity8 won the @entity15 and returned to top of standings
@entity5 unhappy with manner of @entity9 's pole position
the @entity200 has won four races this season with @entity8 winning other two
after the race , @entity5 claimed he and @entity285 were not friends
