@entity0 believes @entity2 's fighting spirit evident in their backs - to - the - wall win at @entity5 is proof that @entity2 players are buying into his philosophy			1
spurs had to defend for long periods at the @entity10 on sunday but @entity12 's 89th - minute winner secured a 2 - 1 victory which took @entity0 's men into seventh place in the @entity16			2
@entity17 midfielder @entity12 also claimed a 90th - minute winner at @entity19 last month , which came just weeks after @entity2 had struck twice in the final six minutes to win 2 - 1 at @entity20			1
@entity2 manager @entity0 ( right ) was delighted with the character his team showed @entity2 's @entity25 ( left ) , @entity12 ( centre ) and @entity24 ( right ) celebrate their 89th - minute winner ' the character is very important , to show and fight in every action , ' @entity2 manager @entity0 said after sunday 's game			1
' we are playing the right way and when you arrive in a different club with different players you always need time to try and put your philosophy on the squad			0
' i am happy with the players , we are showing the character we want and we got the reaction we want			0
@entity12 scores a late winner for @entity2 as they took all three points away from the @entity10 @entity25 ( centre ) leaps above the @entity5 defence to power a header into the back of the net early on ' we have a lot of good players and young talent and players like @entity12 and @entity25 are very important to us			1
' @entity25 's header had given @entity2 a fourth - minute lead but @entity5 created plenty of chances either side of @entity59 's 48th - minute equaliser - the @entity61 's 20th @entity16 goal in 2014 - without managing to make them count			1
however , even though @entity5 had the opportunities to get something out of the match , @entity0 felt @entity2 were good value for the three points which takes them above their opponents in the table			1
' in football you need to score and we deserved to win because we scored			0
in the last few games we deserve more and did n't score , ' he said			0
@entity59 ( left ) slots the ball past @entity74 in the @entity2 goal as the @entity2 defence can only look on ' we deserved more in the first half but then we conceded a goal and @entity5 pushed us			1
' we defended deep and maybe @entity5 played better in this period , but in the last 10 minutes we were always alive			2
' @entity5 manager @entity80 pinned the blame for a second consecutive defeat on individual errors			2
poor marking gave @entity25 the chance to profit from a corner before substitute @entity88 ' careless clearance allowed former @entity5 defender @entity89 to set up @entity12 's low drive from 20 yards			1
@entity80 ( left ) gestures towards the pitch as @entity0 holds his arms out and expresses his surprise @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 and @entity97 look devastated after conceding late on ' it is sickening , two individual errors have cost us and we were not clinical enough , ' @entity80 said			2
' we could have scored a number of goals and did n't			0
the second half was one - way traffic and if it had been a boxing match it would have been called off			0
' we lost it more than they won it and i do not know how we did not win it			0
it is very hard to take			0
' it is an injustice , but football can be cruel at times and we have to learn from that			0
' @entity80 was unhappy that @entity2 forward @entity117 went unpunished for what he saw as several poor challenges , including a swinging arm which left @entity5 's @entity122 prostrate on the floor in the first half			1
' @entity117 had six or seven fouls and was not punished for any of them , which is strange , ' @entity80 said			2
' i asked the fourth official did their player touch the ball at any time ? ' i do n't think he did but that is not the reason we lost			0

late @entity12 goal earns @entity2 all three points
@entity5 had better of the game , but @entity25 and @entity12 strikes secure win
@entity0 says ' we got the reaction we want ' after @entity59 equaliser
but @entity5 boss @entity80 called the result ' an injustice '
