by @entity0 for @entity1 @entity2 already has @entity4 ambitions for @entity5 and says the club should aim for no less than silverware as they prepare for a return to the @entity9 under @entity10			1
the @entity5 ' fifth place finish with a record 72 points earned the side automatic passage into @entity17 club football 's second tier and after friday 's draw , a place in group h with @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23			1
now the @entity25 keeper , lauded as a hero in his home country after the @entity28 in @entity29 , says his club side has no choice but to be ambitious			2
ambitious : @entity2 says @entity5 should be aiming for silverware and the @entity4 , no less well - rounded : @entity2 holds the @entity34 ball , the brand 's most innovative , technologically advanced and aerodynamically tuned ball to date ' we 're in @entity39 again , so that will be good to have those big nights at @entity42 but i think ultimately , at the end of the season we have to be lifting a trophy , i think that 's important , ' @entity2 said during a photo shoot with @entity34 's @entity34 ball			1
' which one that is , it 's difficult to say in august , but certainly that 's the aim and the focus and we have a big enough squad to cope with the demands of @entity39 , different cup competitions and most importantly the @entity57			0
' @entity5 has opened the @entity57 season with two disappointing 2 - 2 draws against promoted @entity59 and @entity60 , who ended last season one place ahead of them			0
in both matches @entity2 's side were 2 - 1 up going into the closing moments only 80th and 90th - minute equalisers turning three points into one			1
still , @entity2 is certain he is the last line of defence for a stronger side than the one which impressed many last year			2
@entity75 , on loan from @entity74 at @entity42 last year , is now a permanent fixture while the arrival of @entity78 also from the west @entity80 giants adds even more quality in the final third			0
late blow : @entity84 heads the 90th - minute equaliser past @entity2 for @entity5 's second 2 - 2 draw of 2014 @entity2 continues : ' outside of that , we want to get into the @entity4 - we think that we can do that , we were just short of that last year but again as i said we 're stronger this season so we feel like we can do it			1
' first they need to turn draws into wins though and their next hurdle could hardly be tougher as they host @entity74 at @entity42 on saturday			0
if fit , @entity78 could debut immediately against his old club while @entity75 is also in some doubt with injury			0
it 's not too late to play @entity101 … there 's £ 1,000 to be won every week by the highest scoring manager			0

@entity5 keeper @entity2 wants his side to lift a trophy at season 's end
the @entity5 play a first @entity9 campaign under @entity10
they play in @entity112 against @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23
@entity2 says the club 's target must be next year 's @entity4
