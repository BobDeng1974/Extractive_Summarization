' i just started training , because i had such a bad knee in @entity41 i did n't know if i 'd be able to play here , and now i have won the @entity44 trophy - i am so excited , ' @entity0 said			2
the match was the most one - sided championship match in the @entity47 finals since @entity48 beat @entity49 6 - 2 , 6 - 0 in 2003			1
@entity0 changed her approach from the group - stage contest , attacking @entity4 's second serve with fierce ground strokes , and regularly rushing the net to cut the points short and prevent her opponent from playing her preferred style			1
' i had to play more @entity0 - style tennis and just do what i do best , ' @entity0 said			0
' i was expecting a much better player than i was in the earlier round			0

' i was nervous before the match that i had to play this big final , ' @entity4 said			0
' i could n't manage very well the situation			0
' i knew that she would be more motivated during this match because we played a few days ago and i won			0
' @entity0 pumps her fist as she closes in on her third consecutive victory at the @entity93 @entity4 has experienced a rapid rise up the rankings but admits nerves got the better of her the irony of sunday 's match was that @entity4 had it within her power to deny @entity0 a place in the final			1
@entity4 went into her final group - stage game knowing that if she lost in straight sets , @entity104 would go into the semifinals at @entity0 ' expense			1
instead , @entity4 lost in three and @entity0 made it in			2
' i have no regrets because i did my job on court against @entity104 , ' @entity4 said			2
' that was the chance but she deserves to win the title			0
' @entity0 said she would have done the same thing if in @entity4 's shoes , namely try to win the group game despite the temptation of knocking out her most dangerous rival			2
' no one on the tour thinks like that , ' @entity0 said			0
' she definitely gives her all so i do n't think that went through her mind at all			0
' @entity0 shares a joke with women 's tennis legend @entity44 , who has the trophy named after her the @entity10 embraces her coach @entity130 after securing the end of year no 1 ranking @entity4 got the first break of the match in the third game and was up 40 - 0 on serve in the next and looked capable of repeating the surprise 6 - 0 , 6 - 2 victory over @entity0 on wednesday			1
however , @entity0 broke back in that fourth game and the course of the match was changed			0
@entity4 won only three points fewer than @entity0 in the opening set but clinched just seven points in the entire second set - including only two on return			1
the set was over in just 25 minutes			0
@entity4 's serve , so effective throughout the tournament , let her down on the big stage where she won fewer than half her first - serve points while @entity0 won 77 percent			1
@entity4 tried in vain to change the momentum , even trying a drop shot from well behind the baseline , but her spirit and body language quickly deteriorated in the face of @entity0 ' relentless attack			0
@entity158 ( @entity159 ) and @entity160 won the doubles event in their last ever tournament together as a pair @entity0 had 25 winners against just five by her opponent			2
@entity4 's victory in the group stage ended @entity0 ' 16 - game winning streak at the @entity47 finals , but the @entity10 built her career win - loss record in the championships that feature the top eight players to 29 wins and five losses			1
@entity0 also retained the season - end top ranking , taking that honor for the fourth time			0
the doubles final was even more one - sided with @entity158 and @entity160 - in their last match together as a pairing - routing defending champions @entity182 and @entity184 6 - 1 , 6 - 0 .			1
