it may take more than a campaign to stop @entity2 this season			1
@entity4 has been charged by the @entity5 for insinuating that referees were being influenced by the media and therefore not giving his team the benefit of the doubt in key decisions			1
and he was given further ‘ evidence ’ for his dossier when referee @entity12 failed to give them a penalty for a @entity16 handball			1
but whatever the @entity5 rule , it will prove largely irrelevant in the long run			0
for @entity2 look to be the team most likely to take advantage of opponents ’ weaknesses and forge ahead in the title race			1

booked : @entity64 , @entity69 , @entity65 manager : @entity81 ( caretaker ) 5.5 referee : @entity12 6 @entity84 man : @entity30 attendance : 41,612 @entity40 scored @entity2 's second - click here for our @entity89 service they were not scintillating , though @entity53 ’s chipped pass and @entity30 ’s flick for @entity40 ’s goal will bear multiple replays			1
at times , however , @entity29 stretched them and even bettered them			1
yet while @entity98 were dropping points against @entity100 , @entity2 were ruthlessly exploiting mistakes			1
@entity103 tests lie ahead but this is a @entity29 team who beat them a month ago , so this victory was an important step on the way to proving their resilience			1
@entity4 was again not speaking publicly , his @entity5 charge given as the reason , so it was left to his assistant @entity114 to explain how the improvement had been obtained at half time			2
‘ @entity4 was very clear to the players what he wanted from them to improve and the players did that , they responded very well , ’ he said			2
‘ @entity4 wanted the team to press further up the pitch and to be mentally more aggressive and assertive with or without the ball and to play at a quicker tempo and they did that			2
’ this may be @entity81 ’s last match in charge — a draw and two defeats hardly represents compelling credentials since @entity134 ’s departure — with @entity135 in discussion with the club , but at least his side went down fighting after the debacle of last saturday ’s @entity141 defeat when they were booed by their own fans			0
and if @entity135 is to be installed he will at least find a compatriot who finally appears up for the fight			0
@entity70 had made 21 appearances for @entity29 prior to this game and , for £ 12million , he has produced zero goals thus far			1
and yet , in the first half , he was unrecognisable			0
@entity34 @entity51 ( centre ) is closely watched @entity29 pair of @entity69 ( left ) and captain @entity151 ( right ) @entity53 takes on possession in the middle of midfield while being watched by @entity69 @entity50 tries not to bring down @entity71 as the @entity29 striker tried to weave his way towards goal @entity40 gestures during the first half of a game the @entity158 took to the @entity33 leaders @entity65 tries to wriggle free of the tireless @entity40 , who fought back and did the dirty work for his team @entity46 suffered but so too did @entity165 , with two of the most consistent defenders so far this season made to look ordinary			1
the @entity169 was withdrawn in the 37th minute because of a groin injury but @entity171 had already made it a sufficiently miserable afternoon for the left back to be grateful for small mercies			2
@entity70 had slalomed his way past three players in the 20th minute with a burst of pace unseen so far and @entity46 deflected his shot wide ; later he would skip past @entity46 and only a fine save from @entity43 prevented him opening the scoring			2
‘ he has been a little bit frustrating but i think he showed his value today , ’ said @entity81			0
‘ he was outstanding in possession and every time he tried to break , someone was clipping him to stop his momentum			0
he added the other side of the game , which was hard work			0
‘ he has now set a standard and i told him in front of everybody , “ it ’s no good you just doing that on a one - off			0
if you ’re not prepared to do it every week , you ’ll be sitting with me and @entity192 [ @entity193 ] on the bench ”			0
but if he performs like that he could get our fans on the edge of the seat — because he had me on the edge of mine today			0
’ @entity70 even survived a strong arm in the face from @entity49 in the 71st minute , which saw a yellow card for the @entity209 but which might have been red			0
and it was not just @entity70			0
@entity43 , deputising for @entity56 , who has an injured thumb but was deemed fit enough for the bench , had to save smartly from @entity72 ’s 22nd - minute free - kick , while @entity66 cut inside with @entity46 again exposed and hit a shot that struck the post @entity71 tries to steer the ball away from @entity2 's @entity209 midfielder @entity49 at @entity38 @entity40 gets it all wrong as he attempts an overhead kick with @entity63 close by @entity46 is held off by @entity71 as the @entity169 tries to retain possession for the @entity158 @entity29 caretaker manager @entity81 ca n't believe a decision goes against his visitors @entity4 ( right , next to @entity224 ) was visibly agitated at what he thought were a number of poor calls made by referee @entity12 the @entity2 players felt aggrieved at a number of decisions against them by @entity232 in west @entity233 @entity43 was between the sticks for the hosts with @entity56 left on the bench with a thumb injury @entity44 tussles with the lively @entity71 as @entity2 sought to dominate the second half @entity72 holds onto the post after he missed a glaring opportunity for @entity81 's side so it was all the more galling for @entity81 ’s team when @entity2 , having threatened very little , were presented with a chance to take the lead			1
@entity51 was the opportunist , taking a quick short corner which out - witted @entity16 and found @entity44			0
with @entity29 unprepared , it was a relatively easy task for the @entity249 to find @entity30 at the far post for a simple finish in the 43rd minute			1
‘ it was very frustrating — just before half - time we switched off , like we did against @entity254 , ’ said @entity81			0
‘ i made a big point of it and it happened again			0
’ it was enough to give @entity2 the foundation they needed			2
they started the second half with an intent and incisiveness which had been missing in the opening 45 minutes			0
and for those who enjoy the conspiracy theory , there was fuel to fire @entity4 ’s talk of a campaign when @entity40 crossed the ball 10 minutes into the restart only for @entity16 ’s out - stretched hand to prevent it reaching danger			1
it was a penalty and @entity40 and @entity50 protested furiously			2
there was no lingering sense of injustice , however , as within four minutes @entity2 had extended their lead			1
@entity53 had @entity29 mesmerised as he chipped a ball in for @entity30			1
the @entity34 executed an exquisite flick back to @entity40 , who cut inside to score his 15th goal of the season			2
‘ that was much more like the @entity2 the supporters would be used to , ’ said @entity114			2
@entity40 might have made it 3 - 0 in the 79th minute , beating each member of @entity29 ’s back four before allowing his wayward shot to be deflected wide by @entity16			1
@entity2 may not invincible this season , as @entity29 proved but a month ago			1
but give them a break and you are unlikely to recover .			0

@entity30 gave @entity2 a lead in the 43rd minute of their @entity33 game against @entity29
*deadly* finisher @entity40 made it two after the break to seal the three points
@entity4 was angry at some decisions by referee @entity12 despite win
