judge @entity65 said : ' we in the courts are familiar with these acts of mindless violence committed by those who may be drunk or may be acting under the influence of drugs or may be angry or may do it for fun			0
referring to a case of three teenagers who beat a tramp to death for a dare , he added : ' we are reminded of the sentence of the three lads in @entity83 yesterday for their mindless violence which resulted in the death of a man			0

@entity36 restaurant in @entity12 , @entity37 , where mr @entity6 worked before the attack			1
it is not yet known if he will be able to return to work ' the consequences could have been lethal , fortunately that was not the case but you know he has suffered very significantly and will continue to suffer from what was perpetrated by you			2
' judge @entity65 added : ' mr @entity6 could have remained in his car but there is no reason why he should be criticised			1
' he got out of the car seeking to persuade you two to let him go on his way			0
his reward for showing that courage to make his point which one would expect could happen in a civilised society , was to be punched by you @entity40 with such force that you hurt your own fist with the punch and mr @entity6 was kicked to the ground			1
' it would appear his head struck the pavement and he was rendered unconscious			0
one would have hoped matters would be left , perhaps you may have sought medical attention but it seems that was not enough because the violence continued			0
a judge said mr @entity6 should not be criticised for getting out to remonstrate with the pair of yobs ' @entity129 approached mr @entity6 when he was not moving on the pavement and kicked his head with such force that your shoe flew off			1
