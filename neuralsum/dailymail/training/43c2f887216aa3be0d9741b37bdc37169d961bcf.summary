@entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 look frightened			1
the trio have competed and won medals against the best athletes in the world , in front of hundreds of thousands and , at times , even millions			1
put three easels , a handful of charcoal , a plethora of paints and a mildly eccentric artist in front of them and their combined years of training counts for very little			1
‘ i ’m the least artistic person ever , ’ sprinter @entity18 makes clear at the start			1
‘ i feel nervous , ’ adds gymnast @entity1 , who won three golds at the @entity22 this year			1
@entity23 , @entity0 , @entity2 and @entity1 stand in front of their artwork the four @entity28 stars paint pictures of themselves in action after a lesson from artist @entity32 @entity2 , a @entity34 100m and 400m sprinter , is speechless			1
they do not have long to learn , as three of @entity38 ’s @entity40 athletes meet for an afternoon art lesson			1
‘ the more you let go , the better it will be , ’ artist @entity42 explains			1
she makes some broad charcoal marks on her page and briefly gives them some tips , before it is their turn			1
@entity42 gets down on to her hands and knees and tells the others to draw her in the starting blocks pose , capturing her movement as she slowly rises to her feet			1
@entity42 begins to move up slowly			1
‘ energy , energy , energy , ’ she barks at them			2
the athletes , funded by the @entity64 , have to keep drawing shapes on top of shapes			2
there are confused looks from the frantically scribbling trio			2
after 15 minutes , they stop to reflect			2
‘ take a step back and take a look , ’ @entity42 says			2
@entity1 steps back and flashes a huge grin to the small gathering of onlookers in the @entity77			1
the artist goes over to his work			1
‘ where are your arms ? ’ she asks			2
‘ i forgot them ! ’ he replies , adding : ‘ i mucked that leg up			2
’ ‘ it does n’t matter , you ’re artists not athletes today , ’ @entity42 says			0
tissues in hand , as they ’ve been instructed , the athletes work away — smudging and drawing — and finish their pieces			0
they are surprisingly good , but this is just the warm - up			0
there is a short break and diver @entity23 turns up , explaining he is late due to losing his car keys and wallet and having to get a train instead			0
he is just in time for the main event , however , and does not hesitate to dive right in			0
@entity32 gives the @entity103 a lesson in drawing at the @entity77 in @entity106 @entity2 , @entity23 , @entity1 and @entity0 pose for a picture with @entity32 the foursome have half an hour to capture themselves in action , using charcoal on canvas then going for it with the paint on top			1
plates of gold , black , red and blue splurges are brought out			0
‘ remember the paint can go outside the figure , ’ @entity42 explains			0
‘ it increases the energy			0
’ the athletes are deep in concentration , with the sort of focus they reserve for when they are competing for gold			0
‘ you ’ve got five minutes to speed up , you ’re all good at that , ’ @entity42 barks again			0
hands are dripping with paint and dirty with charcoal			0
@entity2 wipes sweat from her brow			0
they have crossed the finish line , completed the complex gymnastics routine and pulled off that difficult dive			0
the results are strong and vibrant pieces of artwork			0
all of them have finished with gold — and black and red and blue			0
they are covered in it			0
