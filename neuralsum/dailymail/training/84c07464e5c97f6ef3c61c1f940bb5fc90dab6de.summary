but i just could n't even imagine it			0
i know they have to give you all the options but i just had to give him a chance at survival ' @entity25 was born on may 23 - five weeks before his due date			1

' @entity11 occurs in around one in 2,500 births and accounts for approximately eight per cent of all major congenital abnormalities			0
the diaphragm normally develops in an unborn baby by around the seven to 10 week gestation period			1
@entity11 occurs when the diaphragm fails to form correctly or fails to develop in the unborn baby			2
now 10 weeks old , baby @entity25 is ready to be taken home for the first time when he is discharged from hospital next week it means the abdominal contents herniate into the chest cavity , which in turn prevents the lungs from developing properly			1
the stage at which the abdominal contents herniate , and the size of the hole in the diaphragm , determine how much the baby 's lungs and other internal organs , including the heart , are affected			2
in some rare cases @entity11 is part of a chromosomal syndrome , including @entity56			0
the prognosis for babies diagnosed with @entity11 is 50 per cent			0
once baby is fully stabilised and the doctors are happy with baby ’s blood gases , oxygen levels and general progress , baby will undergo surgery to repair the hernia , but there is no set timescale for when the operation is likely to take place			2

when @entity8 was 20 weeks pregnant a scan revealed her son had the condition congenital diaphragmatic hernia
doctors gave her unborn baby a 50 per cent chance of survival
they advised she and her partner @entity68 consider an abortion
the couple *refused* and on may 23 baby @entity25 was born five weeks early
condition causes a hole in the diaphragm causing the intestines to push into the chest cavity putting *pressure* on the lungs and heart
mother - of - four , ms @entity8 , said : ' we went to find out if we were having a boy or a girl and our whole world came crashing down '
now 10 weeks old baby @entity25 is well enough to go home for the first time
@entity13 said it can not comment on individual cases but added doctors make sure parents are aware of all their options in similar cases
