by @entity0 published : 12:08 est , 26 february 2013 updated : 12:10 est , 26 february 2013 former herding dog @entity1 nearly died when he was shot two years ago , but he is back up on his paws again now that he has a custom - made wheeled harness to get him about			1
a stranger mistook six - year - old @entity1 as a stray dog when he was running outside and tried to kill him as part of a programme to cut down on stray dogs in @entity10			0
his distraught owners , who were shepherds , found him howling in pain and unable to move			0
on his new wheels : @entity1 can still walk in the country with his special walking aid that supports his injured hind legs missing his old job : the six - year - old former herding dog looks longingly at the sheep he would usually be chasing his user - friendly home : @entity1 now lives at an animal centre because his owners who were shepherds could not look after him after his injury his owners rushed him to the @entity24 near the capital @entity26 to see if anything could be done for him			1
the shelter did think about putting @entity1 down , but the director of the centre said ' it was clear that this animal wanted to live ' so they set about finding him a way to walk again			2
eventually they managed to import a special wheeled harness for him , giving him a new lease of life			0
the shepherds could not look after him after he lost the use of his legs , so they gave him over to the animal centre , where he can get up the ramps with no trouble			0
a curious - looking dog : goats stare at @entity47 as he takes a stroll in the countryside by the animal centre taking a little break from walking : @entity1 was nearly put down but the centre said they could tell that he really wanted to live when he was brought in in his herding days , @entity1 used to look after over a hundred sheep			1
he still can not resist following sheep and goats about when he sees them out on walks in the @entity10 countryside around the animal shelter			0
although his working life is over , @entity1 can now live out his days as a pet as @entity10 's first wheel - cart assisted dog			2
happy ending for @entity1 : @entity68 , head of the @entity24 , giving him water taking the weight off his hind legs : @entity1 can now live out his life as a pet though he will never herd sheep like he used to			1

rescue centre did not have the heart to put @entity1 down
@entity1 gets around on his wheels after his back legs stopped working
he is a happy pet , but still misses his sheep herding days
