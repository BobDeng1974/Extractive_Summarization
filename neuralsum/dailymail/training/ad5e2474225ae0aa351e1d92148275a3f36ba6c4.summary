by @entity0 published : 16:38 est , 12 february 2013 updated : 05:14 est , 13 february 2013 a former @entity2 high commissioner who was ordered home after he was accused of touching the bottom of a politician ’s wife is suing the government for £ 1million			1
@entity8 said that despite being cleared by the @entity9 of the ‘ scurrilous ’ claim , he found himself sidelined and ‘ ostracised ’ before he retired after a 40 - year career			2
he was suspended in june 2008 after being accused of behaving ‘ inappropriately towards women at official functions ’ in @entity12			0
the women were reported to have been @entity15 , the common - law wife of prime minister @entity17 , or businesswoman @entity18			0
@entity8 ( right ) was accused of acting inappropriately to @entity15 ( left ) the wife of prime minister @entity17 but mrs @entity18 later dismissed claims she had been groped , and said that , far from making advances , mr @entity8 had been shocked by the forwardness of @entity12 women			1
@entity24 , the barrister for the @entity9 , told the @entity25 yesterday that mr @entity8 had been accused touching a woman ’s bottom during a party game at a social event			1
but @entity30 , mr @entity8 ’s @entity31 , said the claims were ‘ unfounded and scurrilous ’ and that mr @entity8 was ‘ shell - shocked ’ by the bizarre allegations , which were later wholly rejected by the @entity9 ’s own disciplinary panel			1
@entity35 ( right ) , pictured with former @entity38 ambassador @entity37 's wife @entity36 , denied that she had been groped by mr @entity8 mr @entity8 , 61 , of @entity39 , @entity40 , said the claims were ‘ completely ridiculous , nonsensical and untrue ’ and said that his superiors in @entity43 had ‘ prejudged ’ the issue before taking the drastic decision to pull him out of @entity12 after 37 years of service			1
he was never re-engaged at ambassadorial level			0
miss @entity30 said : ‘ it is his case that he was presumed guilty before being given an opportunity to comment on the allegations against him – or before the @entity9 had carried out even the most preliminary investigation to see whether such allegations were worthy of belief			0
’ she said the @entity9 had failed to support mr @entity8 as he faced the baseless misconduct claims , despite him having been a ‘ loyal and dedicated ’ diplomat for almost four decades			1
she said the department had shown a ‘ lack of humanity ’ – barring mr @entity8 from contacting friends and colleagues in @entity12 and delaying the return of his family ’s possessions to the @entity2			1
she said mr @entity8 was put through an internal disciplinary procedure which ‘ broke almost every rule in the fairness book ’ as well as ‘ resurrecting ’ stale bullying claims			2
in august 2008 , the department ’s disciplinary panel cleared mr @entity8 of inappropriate behaviour towards women but gave him a final written warning about his overbearing management style			2
miss @entity30 said : ‘ we say the pursuit of management style and bullying allegations appears to have been carried out to support the decision that had already been made to withdraw him from the post			0
’ mr @entity8 said the department ’s failure to support him triggered a major mental breakdown , leaving him haunted by lingering symptoms of depression			0
' unfounded ' : mr @entity8 was a diplomat in @entity12 until his sudden suspension in june 2008			1
@entity43 's @entity25 , pictured , heard he was left ' shell - shocked ' when his superiors told him of the allegations being levelled against him in his final years at the @entity9 , mr @entity8 said he was sidelined and felt a ‘ deep sense of loss ’ at his treatment and he retired in 2011			1
he said his superiors should have waited to hear his ‘ side of the story ’ before he was withdrawn on the strength of ‘ bizarre and outlandish ’ accusations			0
mr @entity24 said there was ‘ clear evidence ’ that some of mr @entity8 ’s staff had felt ‘ bullied ’ by him			0
mr @entity8 accepted that he was ‘ not mr perfect ’ , but said : ‘ the honest truth is that i did n’t bully them			0
’ the @entity9 denies claims that it failed to support mr @entity8 , maintaining that the decision to suspend him was reasonable given the serious accusations			2
