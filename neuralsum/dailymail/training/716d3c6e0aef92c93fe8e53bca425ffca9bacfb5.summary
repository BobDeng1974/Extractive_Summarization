by @entity0 for @entity1 @entity3 lawmakers amped up their criticisms of president @entity5 this week , openly expressing irritation with the president 's leadership style and his tendency to hold members of his own political party at arm 's length			1
multiple @entity3 senators told the @entity15 that they not only lack a personal relationship with the president , who was once a senator himself , they 've rarely had the opportunity to talk to him one on one throughout the course of his presidency			1
@entity25 sen. @entity24 , now in her second term , summed up the president 's attitude toward his former colleagues this way : ' for him , eating his spinach is schmoozing with elected officials			1
' this is not something that he loves			0
he was n’t that kind of senator			0
' loner : @entity3 lawmakers are irked that president @entity5 does n't work more closely with them @entity40 inside and outside of @entity41 have expressed annoyance with @entity5 throughout his second term over what they perceive as a disinterest in governing and the politicking that goes with it			1
but the president 's political allies have also begun coming forward with their own lists of grievances toward @entity5 , some of which sound similar to their counterparts across the aisle			1
' talented guy but no leader , ' a former member of @entity41 who is now a lobbyist told the @entity59 's @entity58 a couple month 's ago			2
' if he could govern half as well as he campaigns , he 'd be a good - to - great president , ' the former lawmaker said			2
' he 's bored and tired of being president , ' a current @entity3 lawmaker told @entity58			1
on several occasions in recent months the president has made major policy decisions without consulting @entity41 , and , more importantly to @entity3 , his party 's leadership			1
the most egregious example dates back to late may , when @entity5 secretly swapped five @entity71 commanders being held at @entity72 for the safe return of @entity74 , an @entity76 private who was abducted by the @entity71 five years ago in @entity78			2
the @entity79 is legally required to inform @entity41 30 before it releases prisoners from @entity72 of its intentions			0
the @entity5 administration ignored the law to make the @entity74 trade , however , and notified members hours beforehand or not at all			1
' even i have had enough , ' a powerful @entity88 in @entity89 told @entity58 after the terror trade			0
rep. @entity91 , leader of the @entity92 , told @entity93 last week that @entity5 's penchant for acting alone has become a source of irritation for @entity3			1
' not being consulted ahead of time — that just makes people crazy , ' the @entity98 congressman said			0
' let us know ahead of time			0
call us in when you 're developing something so we can give you our ground - level reality check about how this is going to work			0
' former @entity108 basketball player @entity107 , left , and president @entity5 converse while golfing at @entity109 , in @entity110 , @entity111 , on sunday during @entity5 's vacation on @entity114 island			1
@entity5 took close friends and former athletes golfing with him during the trip but no lawmakers the previous sunday president @entity5 played with businessman @entity120			1
as of this week , @entity5 has played 189 games of golf			1
and only twice has he played with lawmakers @entity5 's behavior is baffling , @entity125 rep. @entity124 told @entity93			1
' it 's hard for us to fathom ; i mean , is it just lack of full staffing and resources ? [ is it ] professional commitment ? is it a disdain for the legislative branch ? i mean , what is it ? ' @entity124 wondered			0
' people like me want to be allies — i mean , i am an ally , ' he continued			0
' so work with us , reach out to us ; you know , we 're not the enemy			0
' @entity5 may not view @entity41 as the ' enemy , ' but he certainly does n't view most members of the legislative body as his friends			1
the president rarely takes lawmakers on his golfing trips or invites them over to the @entity79 outside of big group events			2
@entity5 has only golfed with lawmakers twice in the 189 times he 's been on the course since taking office and only one of those times did he bring a @entity88 - sen. @entity158 , @entity159 's top - ranked golfer in @entity41 in 2011			1
' the @entity79 has something in common with the rest of @entity162 , and that is disdain for @entity41 , ' @entity24 said			0
' it is hard to blame them			0
' the @entity79 says the president has had @entity3 over to the @entity79 for meetings 18 times this year , but @entity170 , a senator from @entity171 who was elected in 2010 , told the @entity15 that he ' can count them on both hands ' the number of times he has been to @entity79 since he moved to @entity89			1
and all of those visits were for formal events , he said			0
' it ’s more the interaction that i think has been somewhat lacking — the personal , ' he noted			0
asked by the @entity15 to describe his relationship with @entity5 , @entity125 sen. @entity181 said : ' it ’s fairly nonexistent			2
there ’s not much of a relationship			0
' maybe we wanted something different , ' @entity181 said of his party 's expectations of @entity5			1
' but it kind of is what it is			0
' @entity125 rep. @entity192 tried to explain @entity3 lawmakers ' frustrations with @entity5 in terms of football			1
' certainly , [ former @entity3 president ] @entity197 saw us as his offensive line , and so he attended to the nurturing of his offensive line , ' @entity192 told @entity93			2
' and i do n't think this president , this quarterback , invests all that much time and effort into the care and feeding of his offensive line			2
you can still win , ' @entity192 pointed out			0
' it just makes it a little more difficult			0
' ' in order to work with people , you need to establish the relationship first before you ask for something , ' senator @entity210 of @entity211 , an independent who caucuses with @entity3 told the @entity15			2
' and i think one of the things the @entity79 has not done well and the president has not done well is the simple idea of establishing relationships before there is a crisis			2
' @entity181 said the @entity79 may want to rethink its strategy for dealing with lawmakers moving forward if the president wants to accomplish more items on his legislative agenda			2
' maybe if something is n’t working , you ’d say , " what can i do better ? " ' the @entity210 said .			0

members of @entity5 's own political party feel *isolated* from the president
they say he 's made little effort to build personal relationships with them
@entity5 has been golfing 189 times since taking office but has only taken lawmakers with him twice
@entity3 say they want to work with @entity5 , but he does n't seem to want to work with them
