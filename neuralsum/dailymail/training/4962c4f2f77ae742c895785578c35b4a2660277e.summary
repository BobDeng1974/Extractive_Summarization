by @entity1 reporter published : 11:16 est , 29 october 2013 updated : 04:49 est , 30 october 2013 the heart - warming story of a @entity5 woman whose boyfriend suffered a debilitating brain injury has gone viral since the still - loving couple decided to get married despite his continued disability			1
the story of @entity11 & @entity12 is about as atypical as a love story can be , but it begins and ends the way all the best ones do — with young lovebirds beating the odds to finally tie the knot			1
but after a 10 - month courtship came to an abrupt halt when @entity11 got into a horrific car accident , there was a time when nothing in their young lives seemed certain			2
but their plans came to an abrupt halt when @entity11 suffered a debilitating brain injury shattered : @entity11 was left unable to communicate and it became doubtful that his and @entity12 's dreams would ever come true ‘ @entity11 and i first met in 2005 at college and had a blast for 10 months getting to know each other , ’ @entity12 says in a video documenting their story that has been making the internet rounds recently			1
@entity12 says she and @entity11 were ‘ dating very intentionally ’ and that they planned to get married soon after they were slated to finish college in december 2006			1
but before that could happen , tragedy intervened			0
on september 30 of that year , @entity11 was on his way to work near @entity55 when he was in a serious car crash			1
memories : @entity12 says @entity11 was shopping for engagement rings when he suffered his injury near @entity55 just months before they were to graduate from college in 2006 hopeful : @entity12 moved into @entity11 's family 's home to help take care of him and waited for him to improve			1
if he could communicate , she said , then they could make a marriage work ‘ we got a phone call that he had been in an accident , ’ @entity12 says			1
‘ [ @entity71 ] had suffered a traumatic brain injury			1
’ suddenly , what had seemed so certain to @entity12 , became frighteningly out of reach			2
' we watched our future crash with him in that white station wagon , ' she writes on @entity78			0
but instead of moving on to another man and future husband , @entity12 moved into @entity64 ’s home to help take care of him			1
though @entity11 was unable to communicate , she continued to date him			2
‘ i knew where he was so after he could n’t talk , that helped me so much			0
i knew that he loved me , ’ she says			0
‘ looking back , it ’s weird because he could n’t talk and he could n’t eat , so we probably looked like complete weirdos when we went on dates			0
but we had a blast and i just talked to him all the time			0
’ true love : ' i still do n't think that @entity11 would have ever left me if the role had been reversed			2
and walking away from my best friend was never truly an option , ' says @entity12 @entity12 says she and @entity11 were dating ' very intentionally ' by 2006 and - despite @entity11 's subsequent debilitating injuries that keep him from communicating even remotely normally - they were married finally : once @entity11 could communicate , the couple had to ask a judge if they could marry			1
he said the marriage could proceed ' you two exemplify what love is all about			0
i believe that marriage will not only benefit you both but our community and hope that everyone in this city could see your love for one another , ' said the judge who determined if they could marry ' and even though we chose marriage , we chose it sadly ' : @entity12 and @entity11 live in western @entity5			1
@entity12 looks to @entity114 for inspiration as she continue to struggle with the loss of the man she once knew as @entity11 ’s condition slowly improved , the possibility of marriage became stronger			1
‘ if he could communicate with me , ’ she said			0
‘ then we could have a marriage knowing it would be really different but as long as @entity11 could talk to me we could make it work			1
’ while @entity11 became incrementally healthier , his father became sick			2
he was diagnosed with brain cancer during his son ’s recovery			0
@entity11 ’s father ’s sickness became a catalyst for @entity12 , who knew how much he wanted them to marry			1
when @entity11 was well enough , @entity12 took him to a judge in order to get their marriage approved since he remains unable to make that sort of decision on his own			1
according to @entity12 , the judge told her : ‘ you two exemplify what love is all about			1
i believe that marriage will not only benefit you both but our community and hope that everyone in this city could see your love for one another			0
’ bittersweet : ' we 've watched all of our friends get married and have health			0
i 've watched as my girlfriends and sisters found husbands who could dance with them at their weddings and drive them to church on sunday morning , ' says @entity12 bittersweet : ' sorrow has been a permanent resident in our 20s			2
it feels like the rest of the world uses these years for really fun things			0
but in our 20s , we have watched our future crash with him in that white station wagon ' ' it was so very simple : we love each other ' : while @entity12 never expected to have to provide so much for her husband 's needs , she says the choice to marry was an easy one touching : @entity12 keeps a board in their home on which she and @entity11 and their visitors post what their thankful for			1
@entity12 says half of @entity11 's say ' my wifey ' they would soon be married , though the new would come too late to share with @entity11 ’s father , who died before their engagement			1
their video documents their touching , family and friend - filled wedding			0
instead of standing , @entity12 sits at the altar to be alongside the still seriously disabled @entity11			2
she must even help him stand as they complete their vows , just as she must now help him with everyday tasks			0
dedicated : @entity12 spends her days working in marketing at a western @entity5 bank to help support @entity11 , who is unable to work faithful : ' this church , and this marriage , are hemmed in by @entity199 and eagerly long for heaven			1
he is their author and sustainer , ' says @entity12 ' but in light of all the practicals , and emotionals , ' says @entity12 , ' it was so very simple : we love each other			0
and we believe he is a sovereign and loving @entity114 who rules all things			0
' difficult : ' @entity11 meant that i was signing on to things that i don ¿ t think i ever would 've chosen for myself , ' says @entity12 , who supports @entity11 and manages his care			2
' the practical costs felt huge ' ' though we chose marriage , ' says @entity12 , ' we chose it sadly			1
sorrow has been a permanent resident in our 20s			0
it feels like the rest of the world uses these years for really fun things			0
but in our 20s , we have watched our future crash with him in that white station wagon and we now live with two versions of @entity11			2
' @entity229 watched all of our friends get married and have health			0
@entity233 watched as my girlfriends and sisters found husbands who could dance with them at their weddings and drive them to church on sunday morning			0
' @entity229 watched our dad fight and be taken by brain cancer , only to see life keep marching on			0
' despite it all , @entity12 says it is worth it to be married to the love of her life			2
‘ but in light of all the practicals , and emotionals , ’ she writes on @entity78 , ‘ it was so very simple : we love each other			0
’ @entity12 admits she 's been close to losing her happiness as she struggles with ' our lot ' - a struggle she says is a common one - but she manages to keep the faith thanks to her religion still smiling : alongside @entity11 , @entity12 is still able top enjoy herself at celebrations like weddings and births despite her own personal losses here , @entity12 gleefully holds a baby despite her longing to have one of her own , which may never happen because of her choice to stay with @entity11 inseparable : despite his need for 24 - hour care and inability to communicate as he once could , @entity11 still manages to have fun with @entity12 contentment through suffering : ' i did n't know contentment in my prosperity , ' writes @entity12			1
she says the trials and tribulations she suffered with @entity11 have strengthened her faith and spirit			2

@entity12 *feared* she *'d* never marry @entity11 after he suffered a horrific brain injury while driving to work near @entity55

' though we chose marriage , we chose it sadly ' : @entity12 must now be the *breadwinner* and *caretaker* in her new family as she watches her friends live the life she thought she 's one day have with @entity11
