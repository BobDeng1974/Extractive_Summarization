experts were unable to open the 9th century @entity2 pot , which was found on church land in @entity4 and @entity5 in september the mystery surrounding the contents of a @entity9 pot has been solved after researchers carried out a ct scan on the ancient artefact			1
archaeologists had been unable to open the pot to see what was inside , but its weight suggested it was full of treasure			2
after undergoing a series of scans , the 1,200 - year - old pot was found to contain up to at least five silver brooches and an ornate bead			1
it was among more than 100 objects discovered by metal detectorist @entity26 , 47 in @entity4 in september			1
other items include solid gold jewellery , arm bands and silver ingots			1
the find was deemed one of the most significant @entity9 hoards ever discovered in the @entity34 , but the pot 's contents were a mystery			2
experts were concerned about damaging the 9th century @entity2 pot when attempting to see what was inside			2
but now , the @entity40 at @entity41 , @entity42 , has revealed the ornate box contains around 20 silver , gold and ivory items			1
mr @entity26 , a retired businessman , said the latest discovery was ‘ beautiful and exciting ’			2
‘ it brought it all back to me when i saw what was inside the pot , ’ he continued			2
‘ i was like a kid looking in the sweet shop window unable to touch anything being on the other side of the glass			0
‘ nothing else had been on my mind for two - and - half - months than seeing what was inside the pot , and then seeing it , there was a rush of emotion and was incredibly exciting			0
‘ i was absolutely amazed by what was inside the pot. there seems to be 20 plus artefacts in the pot , while most of them seem to be broaches of some sort			2
‘ it ’s a real mishmash of artefacts			0
not everything comes across clear as there are different types of metal in there			0
‘ there is hopefully something beautiful and exciting to look at when it comes out because [ the owner ] took the time to wrap these items			0
‘ i ’m now waiting on the pot to be emptied , but i understand these things take time and it ’s in the hands of the experts			0
’ experts used a ct scanner to inspect what is inside the @entity9 pot. the circular shape in the upper right corner is said to be an ornate bead			1
the dome object to its left is a bone or ivory bead , and the coil curling from the bottom left to the centre is five brooches			0
but the rectangular shape at the centre remains a mystery @entity26 , who found the trove , was approached by @entity109 , head of collections with @entity111 , who was aware of the previous use of the hospital ’s ct scanner for research			1
with the permission of hospital chief , the pot was brought in for an evening scanning session ( pictured ) a scan of the @entity2 pot was conducted by dr @entity123 , consultant radiographer at the @entity41 , who is also a keen amateur archaeologist			1
he was approached by @entity109 , head of collections with @entity111 , who was aware of the previous use of the hospital ’s ct scanner for archaeological research			1
with the permission of hospital chief @entity131 , the pot was brought in for an evening scanning session			0
‘ this work takes place outwith normal hours and in no way impedes the important work we do for our human patients , ' said dr @entity123			0
‘ the scanner is both rapid and accurate , with the ability to produce 120 visual slices , and is accurate to within half a millimetre			0
’ the monitoring screen revealed the presence of five silver broaches , smaller gold ingots and ivory beads coated with gold - all wrapped in an organic material , possibly leather			1
dr @entity123 added : ‘ the conservationists did not want to [ grope ] about and compromise this precious object			0
' the protected pot is shown being scanned in @entity41			1
the ct scanner consists of an x-ray tube that rotates around the object			1
these rays are received by a detector on the opposite side of the object , and an image of the scan is created			0
it produces 120 visual ' slices ' , and is accurate to within half a millimetre the discovery was made on @entity169 land in @entity4 , however , the exact location has not been revealed because the @entity170 , @entity171 and @entity111 have to make sure its properly protected while the full historical significance of the site is established the discovery was made in early september by mr @entity26			1
fellow metal detectorists reverend dr @entity175 , who is a @entity169 minister of a rural @entity5 charge , and @entity178 , the pastor of an @entity179 in @entity5 were also in the vicinity at the time			0
@entity182 dr @entity175 said : ' we were searching elsewhere when @entity26 initially thought he 'd discovered a @entity9 gaming piece			2
‘ a short time later he ran over to us waving a silver arm - ring and shouting ' @entity9 ' ! it was tremendously exciting , especially when we noticed the silver cross lying face - downwards			2
‘ it was poking out from under the pile of silver ingots and decorated arm - rings , with a finely wound silver chain still attached to it			1
the discovery was made in early september by mr @entity26			1

it was made on @entity169 land , but the exact location has n't been revealed			1
the hoard also includes various brooches , ingots and this gold bird pin the hoard , which consists of more than a hundred artefacts , many of which are historically unique , is now under the care of the @entity171 and is regarded as being of significant international importance			1
within the find is an early @entity211 solid silver cross from the 9th or 10th centuries			2
the cross is engraved with decorations that , experts say , are highly unusual , which mr @entity26 believes may represent the four @entity216 - @entity217			2
it was found among dozens of silver arm - rings and ingots two feet below the surface			1
the excavation was undertaken by @entity223 , the county archaeologist , and , shortly after , mr @entity26 found a second signal at its base			1
further investigations uncovered a second level trove which is of considerably higher quality than the first			0
it includes possibly the largest silver pot from the @entity2 dynasty discovered , which could be up to 1,200 - years - old			1
other finds include a gold ring , and a gold bird pin			0

the discovery was made in early september by retiree @entity26			1
i was made on @entity169 land , but the exact location has n't been revealed			1
a gold ring found in the hoard is pictured an early medieval cross was also found among the hoard of @entity9 treasure			1
the cross is engraved with decorations that experts claim are highly unusual , and which finder mr @entity26 believes may represent the four @entity216 a computerised tomography ( @entity40 ) scan uses x-rays and a computer to create images of objects inside a body - or in this case , a pot. during a @entity40 , the person or object is placed on its back on a flat bed			2
the ct scanner consists of an x-ray tube that rotates around the object			1
these rays are received by a detector on the opposite side , and an image is created			0
images produced by a ct scan are called tomograms and are more detailed than standard x-rays			0
a ct scan , for example , can produce images of complex internal structures and shapes			0
the technology has previously been used to scan the insides of @entity283 mummies			0
‘ it was a heart - stopping moment when the local archaeologist turned it over to reveal rich decoration on the other side			0
’ the hoard falls under the @entity42 law of treasure trove , and is currently in the care of the @entity171			0
the law states that a reward must be made to the finder , and the reward is judged equivalent to the market value of the items			0
the @entity169 general trustees , as the landowners , have reached agreement with mr @entity26 about an equitable sharing of any proceeds , which will eventually be awarded			2
the location of the find is not being revealed			2
the @entity170 , @entity171 and @entity111 are all involved in ensuring the area is properly protected while the full historical significance of the site is established .			0
