by @entity0 published : 08:47 est , 6 august 2013 updated : 09:26 est , 6 august 2013 @entity2 's little sister @entity1 is the cover star of the @entity4 , @entity4 's online magazine the @entity4 , weekly and free online at @entity6 cover : @entity1 on a beach , in a @entity10 sun dress			1
just gorgeous and far less wintry than all those autumn / winter looks on the newsstand glossies			1
the fashion : the best aspect of the fashion is you click , you buy			1
with a selection of bikinis , flats , cover ups and sun dresses			1
you can shop vacation beauty products , too ( good selection , by the way , including @entity24 and @entity25 )			2
just brilliant , but of course , no @entity28 doppelgangers - the editor is @entity30 , who decamped from @entity31 to here , and it shows the features : an interview with @entity1			1
the writer explains to us the meaning of @entity39 , as in the band			2
thankfully , there is none of that dreadful , boring travel writing you get in the main glossies , just photos and the web site of cool new hotels			2
a good idea to get the beauty editor of @entity52 @entity51 to advise on skin care in the sun , and advice for @entity57 skin			2
celebrity mutterings : @entity1 : ‘ i dropped my phone at @entity61 and someone gave it back to me later ! ’ most useless piece of information : @entity65 uses eyebrow gel			1
@entity68 , £ 1.95 @entity0 gives her verdict on this week 's @entity67 magazine the cover : on the day i am reviewing , it is @entity74			1
a very busy cover that still manages to have class			2
the fashion : always very good , with new ideas , and always one vastly overpriced shoot to keep advertisers happy			1
a sense of fun about the trends , too			2
the weekly edit of things to buy now sometimes has dubious recommendations , such as a pair of white and red pointy boots , £ 540 at @entity91			1
the features : i like its 10 hot stories item , but some of the features really go nowhere			0
there is lots of quoting of ‘ sources ’			0
the columnists do n’t quite cut it , mainly because they are not allowed enough words : make the type smaller , particularly on @entity106 ’s page			0
the beauty pages , as with every single mag i have reviewed , plug the new @entity110 range			0
a whole page of shower gels is just not working hard enough			0
celebrity mutterings : nothing of note ! most useless piece of advice : an entire feature telling readers how to make conversation at a wedding ! when talking about whistle blower @entity123 you should say , ‘ he ’s handsome , is n’t he ? ’ @entity126 , £ 3.80 @entity127 stars in september 's @entity126 the cover : @entity127 , who is a good choice , but i find the hair cut very unbecoming			1
the @entity133 dress is stunning			0
the fashion : using catwalk photos , with cut outs of clothes you can buy , is very cheap to do , and a bit old hat , and nowhere near as clever as @entity141			1
there 's yet another plug for @entity145 ’s new lingerie line and ‘ 101 ideas ’ is now 25 years old … it needs a revamp			1
the main shoots feature clothes too expensive even for @entity51 : a sequin and bead dress by @entity133 , at £ 20,600 ! the features : a piece on internet dating by @entity155 which has this gem when she meets up with a man she met online : ‘ his accent is @entity161 , which i could n’t tell from texting			1
’ she sums up : ‘ i worry about the false degree of safety assumed by women looking for love on the web			0
’ but a good piece on mothers in the workplace and how they do n’t pull their weight , and male suicide			0
the beauty pages seem very dated			0
one shoot over several pages featuring close ups of a face , which has been a beauty page staple for three decades , and lots of cheap catwalk and stock beauty photos			0
the back page needs work : it ca n’t just be a page that is all about pearls ‘ not just for monarchs and first ladies ’			0
its readers are smarter than this ! celebrity mutterings : from designer @entity196 : ‘ sometimes i see one of my sculpted dresses and think , if i were slimmer i would wear it			0
’ @entity127 : ‘ salad , it ’s not real food			0
’ most useless piece of advice : ‘ sleep more to eat less			0
