by @entity0 money worries : @entity2 was once worth £ 69million but is now claiming to have 80,000 euros , or £ 65,000 , left in the bank - and facing huge legal costs an aviation tycoon and his wife embroiled in a multi-million pound divorce have been driven to fight over a £ 470,000 vintage @entity8 , which each hopes will fund their huge legal bills			1
@entity2 , 55 , whose fortune was once put at £ 69million , is now ‘ pleading poverty ’ in defending a massive financial claim by the mother of his three children , @entity17 , a senior judge has heard			1
but mrs @entity17 , 47 , says he is claiming to be ‘ penniless ’ as ‘ part of a dishonest strategy ’ to reduce any financial award she may receive by hiding his fortune in an offshore trust			0
now , they are fighting in the @entity28 courts over a 1928 4.5litre @entity29 , valued at £ 472,000 , which is parked at @entity31 , their palatial house in @entity33			1
@entity34 , for mr @entity2 , told @entity36 judge @entity35 that the entrepreneur is caught in legal tangles on both sides of the channel – and his cash reserves have fallen to £ 66,000			1
the couple met in april 2001 and married five years later			0
mrs @entity17 petitioned for divorce in july 2011 , the court heard			0
a decree nisi was pronounced in june last year , but the divorce has yet to be finalised while the couple run up enormous legal bills squabbling over the partition of their assets			0
@entity52 - born mr @entity2 attended university in @entity54 and has lived with his family for spells in the @entity57 and in @entity58			1
he made his fortune through a phenomenally successful aircraft leasing firm			0
mr @entity61 said that mr @entity2 moved the money made from this venture into a trust in 2002			1
valuable : the couple are fighting over this model of @entity8 - a @entity67 ( not actual car ) his wife ’s lawyers say he transferred about £ 69million to the @entity73 - based trust			0
but mr @entity61 said the family ’s living expenses were funded by drawing cash from a bank loan , secured against the trust			0
as of june last year , mr @entity2 had withdrawn £ 18million in this way			2
last may , mrs @entity17 got a worldwide order freezing £ 35million of her ex-husband ’s assets and mr @entity61 said that had ‘ catastrophic ramifications for this family ’s finances ’			0
mr @entity61 said mr @entity2 has since been unable to borrow against the trust ’s assets and it prompted the bank to order the £ 18million he withdrew be repaid			1
when the freezing order was lifted last november , mr @entity61 said the bank was ‘ determined not to reinstate the loan facility ’ and continued to pursue payment of the debt – leaving mr @entity2 with £ 66,000 in cash			2
@entity2 ran a successful aircraft leasing firm and is pictured here with @entity99 ( left ) and @entity100 chief executive officer @entity101 ( centre ) , at the @entity103 in 2007 mr @entity61 said mr @entity2 agreed last november that his lawyers could take a legal charge over the @entity8 as collateral for their fees			1
in january , a high court judge ordered the @entity8 ’s return to @entity54 so that it could serve as security for mrs @entity17 ’s legal costs			0
but mr @entity2 is appealing against that ruling and mr @entity61 said he ‘ really is better off leaving the car where it is ’ until that case is heard			1
he added that the car is in any event currently subject to a @entity58 court order , preventing its removal from the @entity31			2
lord @entity35 ruled in favour of mrs @entity17 , adding that he did not want to make an order which makes it more difficult for the car to be freed from the @entity58 court order			2
mrs @entity17 , the court heard , now lives in another chateau in the same @entity58 town , called @entity124 ( above )			0

@entity2 and ex-wife @entity17 are *locked* in a costly divorce case
both are fighting over a 1928 4.5litre @entity29 parked in @entity58
the car is at @entity31 in @entity33 , where they used to live
they each hope the car will *bankroll* their legal war chest
mr @entity2 is ' pleading poverty ' in the squabble over how assets will be split
