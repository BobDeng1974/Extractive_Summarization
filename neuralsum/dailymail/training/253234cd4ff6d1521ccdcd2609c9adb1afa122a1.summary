a vintage spacecraft will next month close in on @entity1 after an unexpected long journey around the sun. as it approaches our planet , scientists will have a brief chance to communicate with the 36 - year - old probe in an attempt to bring it back to life			1
but with limited resources of its own , @entity12 has made the unprecedented move of handing the reins over to amateur scientists in the hope that a group of space fans can revive the mission			1
pictured is an artist 's concept image of @entity30 in april the @entity31 - made up of the groups @entity33 , @entity34 , and @entity35 - undertook a successful crowd funding project to raise £ 74,000 ( $ 125,000 ) to rescue the probe			2
@entity12 recently officially endorsed the @entity39 - based project and signed a space act agreement for the group to take command and control of the 1970s - era craft			1
this is the first time @entity12 has worked on such an agreement for use of a spacecraft the agency is no longer using or ever planned to use again			1
‘ the intrepid @entity23 spacecraft was sent away from its primary mission to study the physics of the solar wind extending its mission of discovery to study two comets , ’ said @entity12 astronaut @entity50			1
@entity23 was the first satellite to study the constant flow of solar wind streaming toward @entity1 from a stable orbit point between our planet and the sun known as the lagrangian 1 , or @entity66			1
monitoring that wind helped scientists better understand the interconnected sun - @entity1 system , which at its most turbulent can affect satellites around @entity1			1
in 1984 , it was given a new mission and called the @entity30			0
in september 1985 , it passed through the tail of @entity75 , making it the first spacecraft to gather data from a comet			0
it also went on to fly by @entity81 in march 1986			0
from 1991 until 1997 , when it was too far away for reliable communications , this satellite continued to investigate the sun. now it 's coming home to visit - making its closest approach to @entity1 in august before it heads back out to interplanetary space			2
‘ we have a chance to engage a new generation of citizen scientists through this creative effort to recapture the @entity23 spacecraft as it zips by the @entity1 this summer			1
’ in march , amateur radio astronomers were able to track the spacecraft and find out its route , raising hopes that the mission could be revived			0
launched in 1978 to study the constant flow of solar wind streaming toward @entity1 , @entity23 - 3 successfully completed its prime mission in 1981			1
with remaining fuel and functioning instruments , it then was redirected to observe two comets			0
following the end of that mission , the spacecraft continued in orbit around the sun. it is now making its closest approach to @entity1 in more than 30 years			0
the goal of the @entity23 is to put the spacecraft into an orbit at a gravitationally stable point between @entity1 and the sun known as @entity116 1 ( @entity66 )			2
once safely back in orbit , the next step would be to return the spacecraft to operations and use its instruments as they were originally designed			0
the mission 's original communication hardware no longer exists , so controlling the spacecraft required the amateur group to create virtual software versions of the original hardware			2
once proving this was possible , the project is now using the @entity130 ( pictured ) in @entity131 to send commands to @entity23 @entity30 's close approach in the coming weeks provides optimal conditions to attempt communication			0
if communications are unsuccessful , the spacecraft will swing by the moon and continue to orbit the sun. @entity12 said it has shared technical data with these amateur group to help them communicate with and return data from @entity23			1
the mission ’s original communication hardware no longer exists , so controlling the spacecraft will require the amateur group to create virtual software versions of the original hardware			2
if they are able to do this , the project will use the @entity130 radio telescope in @entity131 to send commands to @entity30			0
new data resulting from the project will be shared with the science community and the public , providing a unique tool for teaching students and the public about spacecraft operations and data gathering			0
the data also will provide valuable information about the effects of the space environment on the 36 - year old spacecraft .			0

this is first time @entity12 has given control of one of its craft to the public
@entity39 - based amateur group works under *banner* @entity23
next month it will try to contact the probe and get its systems working
@entity30 was the first satellite to study the constant flow of solar wind
reviving the mission could help scientists better understand solar winds which can affect satellites and the *climate* on @entity1
