by @entity0 towering over the waters at 177ft , @entity1 once ruled the waves			1
built for playboy @entity5 in 1893 , she became a star of the international sailing scene , winning 33 of 43 prestigious races in her first year alone			1
her winning streak continued once @entity5 - then @entity10 - handed the elegant racer to his son , @entity12 rule britannia : the elegant wooden yacht @entity1 , built in 1893 for playboy @entity5 , became a sailing champion within her first year of racing rising up : after decades of legal battles , a construction team have almost completed an inch - by - inch replica of @entity1 , currently lying in @entity20 , @entity21 in fact , she was so loved by @entity12 that he left instructions that she would ' follow him to the grave ' - and when he died in 1936 , she was stripped of her furnishings and sunk off the @entity27			1
now , 78 years on , campaigners are nearing the final stages of a project to complete an an inch - perfect replica of @entity1 which has been 20 years in the making			1
the original @entity1 remains on the sea bed somewhere off the coast of @entity35 - though her official location is a secret			1
but a construction team , which has fought through a bitter legal battle to secure their rights , hopes the replica will be able to take its place alongside iconic warships @entity45 and @entity46 at @entity47			1
the elaborate hull is now ' finished ' - aside from a £ 6 million refurbishment needed to restore her guilded appearance			2
although she is currently lying at a boatyard in @entity20 , near @entity21 , @entity55 , project leaders say it could be on the water within 15 months			0
at the cost of £ 1 million a year to run , she will then be taken all round the world so it can be enjoyed by charities and future generations			1
royal favourite : queen @entity66 's notorious party - boy son @entity5 ( left ) and his son @entity12 ( right ) adored @entity1 , spending most of their year on board beloved : @entity12 ( centre ) loved the 177ft yacht so much that he ordered for her to ' follow him to the grave ' when he died in 1936			1
she was sunk off the @entity27 star : the yacht , pictured dwarfing the @entity78 , won 33 of her first 43 prestigious races , becoming one of the most successful racers in the world of sailing design : the interior was cutting - edge @entity86 , with state - of - the - art architecture to host parties and guests for the royals the project started in 1994 when @entity93 entrepreneur @entity92 gained the @entity66 's blessing to build a replica of her great - grandfather 's yacht			1
mr @entity92 bought a shipyard in @entity99 , @entity100 , and assembled a team of top boat builders and designers to build the boat using the original plans			0
the hull of the yacht was finished but the project ran into trouble in the late 1990s when he sold the shipyard to free up funds and the new owners laid claim to @entity1			2
a lengthy court battle ensued and by the time mr @entity92 got the boat back to @entity93 his funds - along with his love for the project - had dried up			2
in 2011 a @entity119 company called @entity120 came to the rescue and invested enough to keep the project alive and the yacht was transported to @entity124 on the @entity27 before being moved to a temporary base at @entity20			2
a look inside : workers have managed to reconstruct the interior - and have appealed for collectors to source the furnishings that were saved before she was sunk large scale : the hull is supposedly ' finished ' but will still require a £ 6 million refurbishment before it can sail the seas - at the cost of £ 1 million a year it is hoped the yacht will go on to join iconic warships @entity45 and @entity140 at @entity47 where the final refit will be carried out			1
the £ 8 million needed to complete the build will pay for the vast interior of the yacht to be fitted out in period decor to the highest quality			1
it will also fund the building of a lead keel , sails made from traditional cloth , and a huge 153ft , three - tonne silver spruce mast which will be the biggest single wooden mast in the world			2
the trust is also appealing for fixtures and fittings that adorned the original yacht which were saved before it was sunk to be donated			0
they are in the process of shipping an original corner cupboard from @entity1 from @entity160 while @entity161 , a marine photographer , has the original medicine chest			0
first crew : this is the first crew in 1893 who brought the @entity10 international glory			0
it is hoped she will be able to sail with similar success in the years to come dream : the dream is for the new @entity120 to be based in @entity124 , @entity27 , near to the secret location where the remains of the original lie @entity175 , from @entity120 , said : ' the dream is for @entity1 to be a working yacht that upholds the prestige and values of the @entity10 's original			1
' we have had to strip her down to her bare hull and start again			0
' we 've been in talks with the @entity47 and the hope is that we can move @entity1 there once funds are in place			1
it would be a perfect home for her rebuild among the most important vessels in @entity119 's heritage			0
' once finished her long - term home will be in @entity124			0
' we need to raise about eight million pounds			0
the boat itself will cost around six million pounds but then it will cost around 1.5 million pounds a year to run			0
' it 's a mammoth task but one that we are passionate about succeeding in			0
the whole point of the project is to create something historic that can be used and enjoyed by charities all over the world			0
' @entity1 is one of the best known and most loved yachts ever to have been built and through this replica her legacy will continue			2
' @entity1 , a j - class yacht , gave its name to @entity210 's famous motor yacht @entity1 , however the two differ greatly			1
the @entity66 's yacht @entity1 is 412ft long and is powered by a 12,000hp steam turbine			2
it was built in 1953 and in service from 1954 to 1997			0
it was turned into a floating museum is now berthed in @entity216 .			0
