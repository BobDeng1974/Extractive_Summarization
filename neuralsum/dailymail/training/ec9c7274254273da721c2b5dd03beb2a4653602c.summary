by @entity0 published : 01:53 est , 7 march 2014 updated : 02:12 est , 7 march 2014 @entity3 's @entity2 was a sight for sore eyes during the network 's coverage of the @entity8 in @entity9 after contracting pink eye			1
the @entity12 's @entity11 is suggesting @entity3 â€™s 61 - year - old prime - time olympic host may have inadvertently caught the nasty eye virus whilst having @entity16 injections			1
at one point , @entity2 ' had to take six days off to recover , to be replaced by @entity18 because his viral conjunctivitis had become so bad and spread to both eyes			1
@entity3 have flatly denied the claim that botox played any part in the sportscasters ' condition			2
sight for sore eyes : the pink eye in the sportscaster 's left eye spread to both eyes in the first few days of @entity3 's @entity31 coverage sore : @entity2 said he woke up to find his eye was swollen and joked that it was as red ' as the @entity35 flag ' also known as @entity37 , pinkeye is an infection of the mucus membrane that lines the eyelid - causing the eyes to become red and inflamed			1
pinkeye is most commonly contracted from a virus which can spread through person to person contact or contaminated water			0
doctors suggest thorough hand - washing as the best way to prevent getting the infection			2
conjunctivitis can also be caused by bacteria , lack of tears , chemicals or allergies			0
it is not a serious infection and usually clears up within 7 to 10 days			0
while bacterial pinkeye can be treated with antibiotic eye drops , ointment or pills - viral pinkeye usually does n't have a specific treatment			0
however eagle - eyed viewers noted how smooth @entity67 ' forehead was during the high definition coverage of the @entity9 games			0
a spokesperson from @entity71 insisted to the @entity12 : ' this has zero truth to this			0
' on the first day of @entity3 's primetime coverage , the journalist appeared on camera wearing eyeglasses instead of his usual contact lenses , explaining that he had a medical problem with his eyes , which appeared swollen and red			2
after battling through the infection for five nights on - air and sporting a new look by wearing thick glasses , @entity2 was forced to take nearly a week off from the @entity8 , with @entity87 and @entity18 sitting in for him			1
he told reporters that it caused light sensitivity and blurred vision			0
' the worst three days of it i was primarily in a darkened room , ' he said			0
during one broadcast he joked about his red , watery and puffy left eye			1
' i have no choice to go all @entity98 and @entity99 on you for the next couple of nights since i woke up this morning with my left eye swollen shut and just about as red as the old @entity35 flag			1
' following the primetime broadcast , the eye became a trending topic on @entity110 , spawning numerous jokes and even a parody account			0
@entity2 , who has been @entity3 's @entity31 presenter since 1992 , admitted that he was miserable throughout the entire ordeal			2
doctors say it is rare to contract an infection from a @entity16 injection , unless there was some sort of contamination or the patient suffered an allergic reaction			1
infection : @entity124 says @entity2 ' botox injections were to blame			0
@entity3 says that 's complete nonsense and doctors also say it 's very unlikely @entity129 : @entity18 took over the coverage becoming the first woman to anchor @entity133 primetime			1

it 's claimed the anchor contracted pink eye after arriving in @entity138 to cover the @entity139
infection started in left eye before spreading to the right
it 's thought the conjunctivitis was as a result of getting @entity16 injections
@entity3 have said such a suggestion contains ' zero truth ' and even doctors agree it is *extremely* unlikley
@entity87 and @entity18 filled in for him while he was off for a week
