by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 after their wonderful dismantling of @entity5 on friday night , the players of @entity3 stayed locked in their dressing room at @entity8 's @entity7 for 45 minutes			1
@entity9 had placed them in the second phase of the @entity11 with a game to spare , but time still had to be found for prayer			1
when they finally emerged , it was to the realisation that - for some - lives had changed forever			2
back home , @entity18 's team will forever be known as the one that defeated a giant of world football and ensured that another - @entity23 - went home from @entity11 2014 early			1
as their assistant coach the former @entity28 and @entity29 striker @entity27 explained afterwards , many of these players will not fully understand what they have achieved until these finals are over			1
they are auditioning for @entity46 contracts			1
' it 's a big surprise for the world , ' said @entity27			1
the reality is that nobody in the world expected @entity3 to go through in this group			2
but now for sure i know a few of the players will want to do well against @entity23 and end up in the @entity57 is their chance			1
impressive : @entity3 's @entity59 , left , has caught the eye in @entity61 ' we need to win that game to improve and we will enjoy it			1
' i am sure the players want to impress the world by getting three points against a team like @entity23			1
' sometimes when you are a player you do n't realise what you have done			2
today they feel happy but i do n't think it will have sunk in yet quite what they have done here			2
' we know we can go far			2
we have won against a world champion and we need to enjoy that			2
' the remarkable thing about @entity3 's success in @entity79 is that it has been fully deserved			1
these have not been fluke victories			2
against @entity82 - who they beat 3 - 1 - @entity18 's team were second best for 45 minutes but swept the @entity86 away after half - time			2
and against @entity5 they were never inferior in the heat of a @entity61 afternoon			0
team spirit : surprise package @entity3 could finish top of @entity79 confidence and belief runs through this team			0
footage released after friday 's game shows the @entity3 players - still aggrieved at not being awarded a penalty - squaring up to their @entity100 counterparts in the tunnel at half - time			1
@entity107 @entity37 , who will return to @entity38 in july after a loan spell at @entity40 in @entity106 , summed up his teammates ' approach to this tournament			0
if @entity23 are fearing a clean sweep of defeats this week then so they should			1
' football is not decided by what shirt you 're wearing , ' said the forward			0
' with work and effort , you can win against anyone			0
we always believed we could do this			0
we were working for this moment and we have achieved			1
' you never know what will happen in but we will keep working to do more			0
' shock : @entity3 have won their two games against @entity82 and @entity5 at @entity11 of those players who may catch @entity46 attention , @entity37 is one while goalkeeper @entity129 - currently with @entity130 in @entity131 - and @entity132 midfielder @entity59 have already stood out			1
@entity37 added : ' we are not thinking about who we get in the last 16			0
it does not matter to us			0
we were in a group with three champions of the world and we have shown that we can beat anyone			0
' today is unforgettable , we are part of history			0
' nobody would have put a single dollar on this team qualifying and there you go , we are very happy			0
it is the best day of my career , obviously			0
' it is a problem for @entity5 if they did not pay attention to us			0
we trusted in what we were doing			0
this shows that , yes , you can do things if you work hard			0
' a point against @entity23 on tuesday would see @entity3 top @entity79 and face a last - 16 tie against the runner - up from the @entity162 teams : @entity163 , @entity164 , @entity165 and @entity106 .			1

players will be auditioning for contracts when they face @entity23 on tuesday
