' explosive ' revelations pinning some of the blame for the @entity3 - fixing scandal on the @entity4 are expected when @entity6 chief executive @entity5 gives evidence to mps on wednesday			1
traders apparently ' mistakenly ' believed the @entity4 was happy for them to fix the rate , following a telephone call between @entity13 's deputy @entity12 and a ' senior ' @entity6 manager now reported to be mr @entity5			1
the @entity4 has categorically denied anything to do with fiddling the rate which banks borrow money at - which in turn affects how much they charge borrowers on products including mortgages and credit cards			2
the rate acts as a crucial indicator of the health of the banking sector , and therefore the wider economy			0
in 2007 , experts began to express concern that the rate was rising , suggesting banks were becoming wary of lending to each other			0
according to two separate official reports prepared on both sides of the @entity48 , a senior @entity6 official and a senior figure at the @entity4 talked on october 29 , 2008			1
what is libor ? it stands for the @entity55 interbank offer rate and is the interest banks charge to borrow from each other			0
banks rely on this money to lend to customers and businesses			0
its equivalent in @entity64 is called @entity65 does it affect me ? the rate banks pay to raise money affects how much they charge on loans and mortgages			0
an increase in @entity3 can add hundreds of pounds to households ’ annual mortgage repayments or a loan to a small business			2
this was seen with dramatic effect in the run up to the financial crisis , when @entity3 soared and lenders raised their rates			2
it is also used as the benchmark for trillions of pounds in complex financial investments			0
three - month sterling @entity3 from 2006 to 2012 : the rate broadly runs in line with the @entity89 base rate except for the crunch period in 2008 and in recent months how is it set ? the rate is set every morning by a panel of banks and overseen by trade body the @entity97			2
each bank sets the rates at which it believes it can borrow , from overnight to 12 months			0
there are 150 @entity3 rates , spanning ten currencies and 15 time @entity103 has barclays been doing ? @entity6 ’ traders speculating on movements in interest rates were manipulating @entity3 in an effort to make huge profits			1
its traders were conspiring with the ‘ submitters ’ at the bank which lodge their libor rates every morning			2
depending on the way they were betting , traders would urge these submitters to increase the @entity3 rate or lower it			2
@entity6 ’ traders also conspired with ex-employees working at other banks to try to influence their @entity3 submissions			1
during the financial crisis @entity6 also fiddled the figures to dupe the market into thinking it was more financially sound than it was			2
@entity3 is often seen as a barometer of how healthy a bank is			2
just as customers with bad credit records have to pay higher interest rates , banks which are deemed in poor financial health are charged more to borrow			0
@entity6 became anxious that its @entity3 rate was higher than many of its peers and that they were fiddling the figures			1
it decided to join the @entity136 any other banks doing this ? it is likely this is just the tip of the iceberg			0
@entity6 is just the first to get caught			2
for the last two years a dozen regulators on three continents have been combing through the files of more than 20 banks involved in the rate setting process			0
@entity147 bank @entity146 is understood to have already suspended a number of traders , as has the @entity150			0
@entity151 , and @entity152 last week said they were helping the @entity153 with its inquiries			0
the bank official is alleged to have asked why @entity6 ’ @entity3 submissions were higher than those of other banks			1
the @entity153 ’s report on @entity6 published on wednesday said mr @entity12 spoke with a senior @entity6 manager now known to be mr @entity5 on october 29 in a routine telephone call			1
in it , he made ‘ no instruction for @entity6 to lower its @entity3 submissions ’			1
but the report added : ‘ however , as the substance of the telephone conversation was relayed down the chain of command at @entity6 , a misunderstanding or miscommunication occurred			0
‘ this meant that @entity6 ’ submitters believed mistakenly that they were operating under an instruction from the @entity4 ( as conveyed by senior management ) to reduce @entity6 ’ @entity3 submissions			1
’ casting his mind back : mr @entity5 , who is facing calls to resign , is understood to have a ' different recollection ' of discussions between @entity6 and the @entity4 to that held by mr @entity12 submitters are the managers who give borrowing data to the @entity184 ’s @entity3 - setting committees			1
the @entity153 report refers to ‘ a telephone conversation between a senior individual at @entity6 and the @entity4 during which the external perceptions of @entity6 ’ libor submissions were discussed ’			1
under scrutiny : @entity6 chief executive @entity5 ( left ) , with @entity191 , who is resigning as the bank 's chairman according to the @entity198 ’s business editor @entity195 , no contemporaneous minute or recording of the conversation was made , but mr @entity5 and mr @entity12 ‘ have different recollections of it ’			1
@entity201 documents conclude that mr @entity12 did not give any instruction to artificially depress the interest rates			1
a @entity4 spokesman said : ‘ it is nonsense to suggest the @entity4 was aware of any impropriety in the setting of @entity3			1
‘ if we had been aware of attempts to manipulate @entity3 , we would have treated them very seriously			0
’ but the fact that the pair were talking about @entity3 at a time when @entity6 was submitting false information will leave mr @entity5 , who is due to testify to @entity215 on wednesday , facing difficult questions			1
the conversation could also prove awkward for mr @entity12 , who is a leading candidate to succeed sir @entity13 as governor next year , as well as prompting questions about whether the @entity33 had any similar discussions with the banks			2
business secretary dr @entity222 said yesterday that the public wanted to see bankers prosecuted if they had committed criminal offences , and revealed that ministers would launch a consultation this week on criminal sanctions for directors of failed banks			0
‘ if there has been criminal activity people must be brought before the courts , ’ he told @entity231			0
dr @entity222 added : ‘ [ the public ] just ca n’t understand why people are thrown into jail for petty theft and these guys just walk away having perpetrated what looks like a conspiracy			0
’ however , lord @entity242 , chairman of the @entity153 , said @entity3 - fixing did not fall foul of the current law			0
a @entity4 spokesman confirmed that mr @entity12 was one of the parties involved			1
he said : ‘ the call referred to in the report was one of many regular market calls made by the @entity4 , in this case by @entity12			1
’ a @entity6 spokesman declined to comment .			0

phone call between ' @entity5 ' and @entity12 is said to have led to traders ' mistakenly ' believing they had @entity4 backing to fix @entity3
@entity6 chief executive mr @entity5 could give ' explosive ' evidence about his discussions with the bank when he appears before mp on wednesday
