the number of stay - at - home mothers is dropping at a rate of 450 a day and is about to fall below two million for the first time , official figures reveal			1
the @entity5 said just 2.005million women are full - time mothers , compared to three million in 1993			1
many say they have been forced to return to work by rising household bills at a time when their partner ’s wages have been frozen , or have hardly increased , for six years			1
a thing of the past : the image of the house - bound housewife was once ingrained on the national consciousness , such as in this 1963 advert			0
nowadays the number of stay - at - home mothers is falling rapidly meanwhile more women are employed than ever before , the @entity5 said , with 67.9 per cent of those aged 16 to 64 in a job			1
the figures represent an extraordinary social change			1
when @entity5 records began in 1971 , only half of women worked			1
@entity29 , of support group mothers at @entity31 , said : ‘ more than 80 per cent of parents recently cited financial difficulties as the main factor in pressurising them or their partner to return to work			1
‘ current house prices and the high cost of rent are also factors pushing more stay - at - home parents back into the workplace			0
’ family expert @entity44 said mothers ' would like to have more time for their families ' the way in which the tax system recognises marriage has been the subject of furious debate at @entity53			2
a long - awaited tax break for married couples , which comes into force next april , will allow a parent to transfer £ 1,000 of their personal tax - free income allowance to their spouse			0
around 3.4million couples are expected to benefit , but it means a saving of only £ 200 a year , or £ 3.85 a week			0
@entity64 , who has promised a tax break for married couples since 2005 , says he would like to make it more substantial if he is re-elected			0
next year , a far more generous perk is being introduced for couples who both work			2
parents will be able to get up to £ 2,000 per child off annual childcare bills			2
more than 14million women aged 16 and over have a job , and that number is growing by around 1,800 every day			1
for many higher earning families , the loss of their child benefit in january last year has added to the pressure on women to go back to work			1
around 1.1million parents lost some or all of their eligibility for child benefit when the government changed the rules			0
many mothers opt for self - employment , which allows them to control the hours that they work and to fit them around family life , such as not working during school holidays			2
one mother on the @entity96 website wrote of the emotional torture of working full - time with very young children			0
she said : ‘ i work full - time and my daughter is in full - time nursery 8am to 6am			2
we spend the weekends not enjoying our time off , but trying to catch up on housework			0
it is not a life			0
‘ i get seriously stressed and then worn out and ill. it is horrible , is n’t it ? but when you need to earn money to live , it is not possible to be at home			0
’ @entity44 , a family expert and the author of @entity115 , said recently : ‘ the pressure continues to increase for mothers to work to support the family finances			1
yet we know from so many surveys and studies that mothers would like to have more time for their families			2
‘ the government and the @entity125 are totally focused on childcare , but nobody stops to question if this is what women really want			0

more women are employed than ever with two thirds aged 16 to 64 in work
only half had jobs when @entity5 figures began in 1971
