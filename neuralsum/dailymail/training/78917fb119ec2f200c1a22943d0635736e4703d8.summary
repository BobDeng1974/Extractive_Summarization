all he wanted was a phone call			2
according to @entity2 , the most toxic scandal in the history of the @entity6 era could have been avoided if @entity7 had just picked up the telephone and apologised			1
yet is n’t that the nub of it ? the reason @entity7 ’s foul exchange with @entity14 ’s brother @entity13 continues to resonate almost three years later is because civil resolution was impossible once the wheels of the modern race scandal began turning			1
@entity14 ’s recollection of that time is shaming for @entity21 society			1
smashed windows , bullets in the post , abuse in the street			2
his mother was hospitalised with stress			0
and his family were the victims			2
understandably , he feels bitter that @entity7 appeared without remorse through this turbulent period			1
yet it was not as simple as that			0
the @entity35 ruled that @entity36 ( left ) was called a ' f * * * * * * black c * * * ' by @entity7 ( right ) in october 2011 @entity2 has revealed that if @entity7 ( left ) had phoned then the race row could have been solved @entity2 ( left ) says he no longer speaks to his former @entity40 team - mate @entity7 ( right ) the moment a member of the public complained about what @entity7 is alleged to have shouted down the pitch on october 23 , 2011 , communication became impossible			1
that is the nature of this beast			0
other disputes can be resolved with clear - eyed honesty , but the instantaneously sensitive process around race cases ends all hope of a swift or constructive outcome			1
in an ideal world , @entity7 learns , the @entity2 family receives its apology , examples are set , progress is made			1
this is not to brush racial politics under the carpet			2
the two sides could have been reconciled in the glare of publicity , maybe appeared side by side , taking questions from the floor			0
it would have been awkward but was the alternative much better ? court cases and @entity35 hearings , resignations and sackings and , at the end , what ? @entity7 quit @entity40 after the @entity35 ’s charge , despite being cleared in court of racial abuse @entity36 ( right ) leaves @entity80 following @entity7 's criminal case in 2012 if the incident was repeated at a match next weekend , would @entity83 football be any further forward ? it would have some nice , statutory punishment procedures in place , but little more			1
education , contrition and growth should be the aim : qualities a little more useful than a 10 - game ban			2
everyone has , at some point , spoken in the heat of a moment			2
everyone has said something they instantly regret			0
nothing as incendiary as the words @entity7 is accused of uttering			1
not racist , but worthy of apology			0
and that apology can be made , whether immediately or on reflection , in the hope of advancement			0
we resolve and move on			0
@entity2 ( right ) says the race row involving his brother @entity13 ( left ) could have been sorted with a call @entity7 ( right ) was banned by @entity35 for alleged language used against @entity36 ( left ) in october 2011 yet that was not the case on october 23			1
within hours , under pressure , @entity7 had his alibi and was sticking to it			1
equally , social media had begun driving a news agenda that screamed for action			0
the authorities responded with intent to prosecute			0
and that was the point of no return			0
reflecting on the days that followed in his autobiography , @entity2 is insightful on race issues			1
‘ the matter should have been sorted quickly in a way that would have allowed everyone , including @entity7 , to emerge with dignity , ’ he says			2
of course , he is right			0
that would have been considerably healthier than the saga played out across courtrooms and in the offices of the national association , a scandal that cost the job of the @entity40 manager and its captain , and the careers of several footballers			2
@entity14 did not play for @entity40 again , @entity7 retired in haste and @entity13 has not been the same player			1
@entity2 ( left to right ) , @entity147 and @entity7 were all team - mates for @entity40 for several years @entity2 ( right ) and @entity7 ( left ) have not spoken since the @entity151 - @entity150 match in october 2011 yet , just as @entity2 admits in his autobiography that he was under legal instruction not to talk publicly about the case , so @entity7 would have been under pressure			1
he would have received legal counsel , and possibly advice from his club , and they would have been of one voice			2
say sorry , they would have told him , and you might as well admit guilt			0
he was never going to pick up the phone and make that call , once the external clamour began			0
@entity2 apparently sought reconciliation , a chance to talk frankly and to receive honesty in return			1
instead , the last direct conversation @entity7 had with a member of the @entity2 family took place that fateful sunday ; any other contact was deemed too complex , just at a time when openness , intimacy and sincerity was urgently required			1
‘ everyone please just respect each other , ’ is @entity2 ’s message now			2
he almost echoes @entity184 ’s plaintive plea during the @entity186 riots			0
‘ can we all get along ? ’ @entity184 asked			0
and we can , mostly			0
yet the fall - out from @entity83 football ’s most poisonous exchange is scant evidence of it			1
the processes put in place failed miserably and have left @entity83 football no further advanced			1
there is still no legacy beyond bitter recrimination			0
nobody learns , nobody grows and nobody says sorry any more			0

@entity2 recalls race row with @entity7 in his new book , *#* *2sides*
@entity7 used racially - *aggravated* language towards @entity14 's brother @entity13 at @entity213 in october 2011 that led to a court case and @entity35 *investigation*
@entity14 says scandal could have been avoided if @entity7 had just phoned the @entity2 family and apologised for using language in heart of the moment
moment member of public complained communication became impossible
@entity2 says he was under legal instruction not to talk about case
if incident was repeated next weekend , new punishment procedures would be in place but @entity6 remains *uneducated* on racial issues
@entity83 football no further advanced in dealing with it than three years *ago*
