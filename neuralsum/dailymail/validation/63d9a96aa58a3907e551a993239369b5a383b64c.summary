the interior walls of training complexes are invariably decorated with motivational slogans			2
simple truisms to feed the mind on days when the body is weak			2
for @entity7 , the old wisdom – fail to prepare , then prepare to fail – is more a way of life than a fleeting thought			1
to the uninitiated , tomorrow ’s final will be settled over 90 , maybe 120 minutes , with the lingering possibility of penalty kicks			1
@entity15 keeper @entity7 is fully focused ahead of the @entity16 with @entity17			1
but , long before the first ball is kicked in earnest , the @entity15 goalkeeper fully expects to be ahead in the battle of wits			1
while much of what will transpire between @entity15 and @entity17 will be random and instinctive , @entity7 believes his slavish devotion to studying what ’s liable to be thrown at him can significantly shorten the odds on his side coming out on top			1
‘ every game , ’ he replied when asked how frequently he ’d dip into video analysis			2
‘ free kicks , penalties , the way strikers like to finish the ball , how they strike the ball			2
‘ i just look at those things and keep mental notes on how they like to do things and what ’s their favourite side			2
notes are taken on different players so i know			2
@entity7 fails to hold the ball allowing @entity47 of @entity48 to score in the @entity49 ‘ it ’s about taking that research out on the training pitch , too , and practicing for who you ’re going to be playing against - a team that likes to put a lot of low , early crosses into the box , for example			1
‘ for the @entity62 game , it was deep early crosses hung up to the back post so we focused our training around that			1
that played out during the game too as i was able to come and take the deep crosses that were taking the pressure off			2
between all of us we come up with a plan for the game			2
’ and when that plan comes together in the form of a victory and a clean sheet ? @entity7 will be hoping to celebrates his first showcase occasion since @entity79 earned cup glory in 2006 ‘ absolutely , it ’s satisfying , ’ @entity7 added			1
‘ it becomes a team effort with @entity84 ( @entity85 , the goalkeeping coach ) and the video analysis guys to ensure we ’re as well prepared as possible			2
and that ’s not just me - @entity89 does it with midfielders and defenders , so it ’s preparation			2
‘ what we ’re trying to do is make the game as easy as possible for us so we know what we ’re coming up against			2
’ @entity15 have not reinvented the wheel with their forensic approach			2
nine years ago , @entity7 played in the @entity99 for @entity79 against @entity100 – his last major final as it would transpire			1
few neutral observers fancied the @entity102 to go the distance that day but they did just that			2
@entity7 ’s intervention in the final chapter was key , however			1
as @entity79 hit four perfect kicks , he saved from @entity108 before watching @entity110 sky the eighth and final kick over the top			1
@entity15 goalkeeper @entity7 celebrates their goal during the @entity115 match against @entity116 ‘ i had a fair idea of most of the @entity100 penalty takers , ’ he recalled			1
‘ i had seen penalties from them			0
with penalties , nowadays everyone does their homework			0
’ that stop from 12 yards not only allowed @entity7 to lift the only major honour of his career to date - it cemented his reputation as one of the finest goalkeepers @entity131 has produced			1
when a £ 9million move to @entity134 was completed a year later , it seemed he ’d spend half his life on the winner ’s podium			1
little did he realise at the time , how unique those scenes of celebration would prove			0
a year ago , with the road back from injury seemingly never ending , the chance of another fix of the winning feeling seemed fanciful			1
‘ i probably did n’t appreciate at the time like i should have done - playing in a cup final , winning a cup , ’ he reflected			1
@entity15 keeper @entity7 speaks with referee @entity148 after the @entity99 quarter final ‘ albeit it ’s a different competition this sunday but it ’s still to win a cup , i probably did think it would come around again , that i ’d get another chance			1
‘ i have n’t been close until now so i ’m going to enjoy this one a little bit more , but then i ’ll only really enjoy it if we win the match			0
‘ it ’s not something i ’ll look back on fondly if we do n’t			1
certainly i want to take it in a little more this time			0
’ @entity7 is beaten by @entity62 striker @entity161 during @entity79 ' 3 - 2 defeat at @entity163 in @entity164 @entity79 ’ 2006 @entity166 triumph was obviously memorable			1
yet lurking just beneath the surface lay a sense of regret			0
@entity171 ’s side had started the campaign like a train but being unbeaten and top of the league in october was n’t enough to shield him from @entity178 ’s axe			0
@entity179 took temporary charge before @entity181 arrived			0
in time , he was bulleted to make way for @entity183			0
despite the endless turmoil , @entity79 still split the @entity185 , with @entity62 nudged into third place			1
there are those in @entity189 who will go to their graves believing they could have gone one better had it not been for in the insanity of the man at the top			0
@entity196 during the @entity199 @entity198 match against @entity15 at @entity200 ‘ we ’ll never know , ’ @entity7 shrugged			1
‘ would more have been achieved ? it may have but it may not			0
you can speculate but no - one at the time could have told if there was more to come from that group of players			0
it was still a successful time and one i ’ll remember fondly for the rest of my years			0
’ they were , to put it mildly , colourful days			2
@entity178 ’s liking for self - harm culminated in @entity7 , @entity213 and @entity214 taking the unusual step of holding a press conference to air their frustrations			1
the @entity220 , as they were dubbed , all lived to tell the tale			0
‘ it was great days playing in a great team and enjoying playing football , ’ @entity7 reflected			1
‘ they ’re the things people remember when you finish			0
@entity7 in action during the @entity230 @entity229 between against @entity15 at @entity166 @entity7 and @entity231 celebrate in front of the fans as @entity79 beat @entity234 1 - 0 at @entity235 ‘ it was a really good team and when that team gets back together it ’s a special time for the @entity79 fans because they were packing out the ground every week and winning most matches at home and scoring lots of goals			1
‘ there was always a downside but on the other side of that we were quite successful on the pitch			0
it was a good team			0
‘ whatever went on elsewhere was something which did n’t really affect us			0
that was because of the strength of the characters we had			0
@entity7 throws his gloves in to the crowd following the @entity198 match with @entity257 ‘ there are players from that team and some really good characters			1
quite a few of that team have gone into management and will probably continue to do so			0
’ while @entity214 , @entity213 and @entity265 have done just that , @entity7 still has many races to run as a player			1
still in contention for three trophies as @entity15 ’s @entity271 , a nine - year wait to feel a winner ’s medal around his neck again could be emphatically bookended in the coming weeks			0
@entity276 celebrates scoring past goalkeeper @entity7 during a pre-season friendly at @entity279 ‘ it ’s hard , we have played a lot of games already , ’ @entity7 added			1
‘ but that ’s something you have to deal with when you ’re fighting on so many fronts			0
trying to win three trophies is going to take its toll but these are the games you have to get through and recover well between times			0
‘ up until now we ’ve managed it pretty well			0
even when we ’ve not been playing well we ’ve still managed to get through and get the results			0
‘ i do n’t think that ’s a problem			0
it ’s part and parcel of having a successful season			0
it ’s something you have to deal with and we will			0
’ @entity303 goalkeeper @entity7 in goal for @entity134 after his £ 9million exit from @entity79 back in 2007 so far , he ’s dealt with just about everything that been cast his way			1
from the cynics that felt signing a long - term crock to replace @entity311 would only end one way , to the strikers in @entity131 and across @entity314 who have found him back to his imperious best			1
it ’s not taken long for the smoke signals to be seen down south either			0
@entity317 have been linked with a move for the 32 - year - old as back - up for @entity321 this summer			2
but surely @entity7 , who effectively still has a two - year tie to @entity200 , has spent enough time watching football these past three years to not voluntarily do so again ? ‘ who says i could n’t be @entity271 , like ? ’ he laughed			1
‘ it ’s flattering but i ’ll just concentrate on doing what i ’m doing and we ’ll see what happens after that			0

@entity7 preparing for his first final appearance since 2006

back then @entity7 had a big *future* ahead of him impressing for @entity131
injury hit spell with @entity134 put *pay* to his regular *silverware* *dreams*
