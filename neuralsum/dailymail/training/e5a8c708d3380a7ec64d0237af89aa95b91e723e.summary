this was brutal , the most emphatic example yet of the massive gulf between these sides in one - day cricket that leaves @entity5 searching desperately for answers if they are not to crash to yet another @entity8 humiliation			2
it was always probable @entity10 , the world champions , would provide much stiffer opposition over 50 - overs than the rabble who crashed to three heavy test defeats			1
but no - one expected it to be as embarrassing for the hosts as this			0
@entity10 , and their passionate supporters , have come alive in coloured clothing , emphasising their modern priorities , while @entity5 have looked like an out - dated throwback of a one - day side lacking confidence and imagination			1
@entity30 's selection doubts easy does it : @entity33 hugs @entity34 after smashing the winnings runs celebration : @entity37 after reaching his century in double quick time i ca n't look : @entity41 pulls his cap over his eyes after another woeful @entity45 display by @entity5 video captain cook belives @entity5 can turn odi fortunes around a crushing nine - wicket defeat , sealed with an incredible 117 balls to spare , gives @entity10 their first win in a bilateral one - day series on these shores for 24 years and hands @entity41 his fifth successive one - day series defeat			1
these three successive humbling losses are close to as bad as it can get in one - day cricket			0
only when @entity5 sent their @entity61 team to contest a 50 - over series in the @entity63 earlier this year under @entity64 have they been successful in the longer limited - overs game , providing considerable food for thought			1
what a long time ago now that @entity68 must seem for @entity41 , who almost cruelly finds himself back under the microscope as captain so soon after rising to the greatest challenge of his career to turn the test tables on @entity10			0
and how long ago last year ’s @entity74 now seems when @entity5 threw away their chance against these same opponents on this same @entity78 ground to win their first global trophy in the longer form of the one - day game			2
it is easy to forget now that @entity5 ’s methods lifted them to the top of the world one - day rankings just two years ago under @entity41 and took them to within 20 runs with 16 balls left and six wickets in hand of that @entity74 win			1
yet that is a world away now , with the start of the long run of one - day cricket that is supposed to give @entity5 a much better chance of winning their first @entity8 turning into a nightmare and leading to much soul - searching			2
‘ it was tough to take , ’ admitted @entity41 after a game that was done and dusted by 4.30pm			0
‘ it ’s a really tough place to be but we ’ve got to stay true to our beliefs as a team and as players			0
when you start losing people chip away at you and you start doubting yourself			0
it ’s a true test of character for the whole team now			0
’ @entity10 certainly played a different one - day game on tuesday , a tigerish performance in the field and a lack of dynamism from @entity5 leaving them woefully short of par when they were bowled out in the last over for just 206			1
only @entity115 , given his first chance in this series , provided any hope for @entity5 with a positive display of one - day hitting that has to be a template for his colleagues			1
it is a question of mind - set and tactics as much as personnel			0
castled : @entity127 looks back after being bowled by a beauty from @entity129 mob rule : the @entity10 players congratulate @entity129 after his dismissal of @entity127 the long walk : @entity41 trudges back to the pavilion after being caught trying to cut trying something different : @entity136 attempts a reverse sweep during a stilted innings @entity5 are criticised for playing ‘ old - fashioned ’ one - day cricket but there is nothing new or innovative , really , in using your feet to spinners and hitting over the top , as @entity115 did productively in reaching 67 off 50 balls			1
it was @entity5 ’s age - old problem in forcing the pace against spin that proved their undoing in the last two games but here they had just as many problems against what can only just be described as ‘ pace ’ bowling			2
@entity156 and @entity129 were hardly express but had the pace and nous to reduce @entity5 to 23 for three , a position from which there was no way back despite the efforts of @entity115 and , to a lesser extent , @entity164			2
@entity5 ’s score never looked enough but it was shown to be hopelessly inadequate by @entity10 ’s reply as they cruised home with almost half their innings in hand for the loss of only @entity37 , who made his first one - day century			1
sweeping statement : @entity115 gets one away to the boundary in his 67 from just 50 balls nearly a goner : @entity175 ( centre ) narrowly avoids being run out over and out : @entity177 is bowled by @entity156 to wrap up the @entity5 innings it was ridiculously easy for @entity10 , with only the paucity of @entity5 ’s total stopping @entity181 reaching his hundred , too			1
as it was he smashed a six off @entity177 to finish things off and leave himself three short of his landmark			0
as for @entity5 , surely they must reconsider their approach to one - day cricket ? ‘ we do n’t need to change our approach we just need to get better , ’ added @entity41 , who insisted he wanted to remain as one - day captain			2
‘ i ’ve captained for three - and - a - half years with the goal of trying to win the @entity8 in @entity194			0
i know that sounds far - fetched but there ’s a lot of good players in our changing room and if we improve we ’ve got a chance			0
we have to believe that			0
’ it is fast becoming , with just a dead rubber at @entity204 on friday to come in this series , an even bigger challenge for @entity41 than turning round test cricket			0
feeling down : @entity175 on the floor as @entity10 pile on the runs the joy of six : @entity212 fans celebrate a maximum by @entity37 ( left ) in the easy win hitting out : @entity33 pulls the ball to the boundary in his innings of 97 not out none came , but many more boundaries did			1
both @entity10 openers reached their 50s with sixes , @entity37 first - sweeping @entity224 - and then @entity33 hoisting @entity223 high over long on			1
they were still greedy for more , @entity37 racing to a 96 - ball hundred containing nine fours and four sixes and @entity33 finally putting @entity5 out of their misery with his fourth six to finish the rout			1
with every blow , the cheers and jeers in the crowd rose another notch			0
as in @entity236 , though , it was with bat rather than ball that @entity5 had once again put themselves in an impossible position .			2

@entity10 win series 3 - 0 after cruising to *victory* with 19.3 overs to spare
@entity5 were bowled out for just 206
@entity115 top scored with 67 from 50 balls
@entity10 's openers put on stand of *183*
