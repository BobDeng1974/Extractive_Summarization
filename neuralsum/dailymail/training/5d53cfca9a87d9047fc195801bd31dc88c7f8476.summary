petrol prices could fall to £ 1 a litre for the first time in five years if a slump in the market continues , one of @entity3 's leading drivers ' lobbyists has claimed			1
professor @entity9 , head of the @entity10 , said although the ' tantalising ' prospect was still distant it had been made thinkable by plunging crude oil prices			1
the cost of a barrel has fallen from more than $ 90 a barrel six weeks ago to a three - year low of $ 78 , prompting a new push by politicians for supermarkets to slash pump prices			1
slump : @entity10 chief @entity9 ( left ) raised the ' distant ' but ' tantalising ' prospect of petrol falling below £ 1 a litre in a week where @entity24 ( right ) called on retailers to cut prices at the pumps the call by treasury chief secretary @entity24 intensified competition between @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34 - all of which cut petrol prices by around 1p on wednesday			1
across the country pump prices already stand at their lowest level in around four years			0
prof @entity9 told @entity42 : ' when oil was last at $ 60 a barrel in spring 2009 , the price of petrol stood at just under £ 1 a litre			1
' rising vat and fuel duty rates need to be factored in , along with changes to the exchange rate , but a continued fall in crude prices raises the tantalising – though distant – prospect of getting change from a quid for every litre you buy			2
' crude oil prices shot to record levels of $ 140 a barrel in summer 2008 , months before the collapse of the bank @entity62 gave the first signs of a global financial crisis			1
ups and downs : how crude oil prices fluctuated in the last ten years , hitting a peak in 2008 before the crash petrol prices have already fallen sharply in recent weeks , but ministers believe they should drop further just a year later oil prices dipped below $ 45 a barrel , prompting motorists to call on sellers to slash prices in return			2
since then oil prices have gradually risen and hovered around $ 100 for the last few years until they dropped below $ 80 a barrel again this month			2
the fall in prices prompted a war of words this week between politicians - who urged petrol retailers to drop prices - and the retailers themselves , who said fuel duty should be slashed			0
@entity32 petrol fell to 119.7p a litre and diesel to 123.7p , the first time its petrol had dipped under 120p in four years			0
@entity92 insisted it was ‘ doing its bit ’ to keep pump prices low but added : ' crude oil costs account only for about one third of the price at the pump – tax and duty on fuel account for almost two thirds			0
' @entity104 , of the @entity103 , said it had tried for weeks to discuss the issue with the @entity106 adding that ‘ to criticise the industry without speaking to us is grossly unfair ’			0
but mr @entity24 warned : ‘ when the price of oil falls , the public have a right to expect pump prices to fall like a stone , not a feather ’			0
@entity116 of the @entity117 said that while supermarkets were leading the price cuts , ‘ fuel prices … are not moving fast enough ’ .			0

prof @entity9 said prospect was thanks to falling crude oil prices
it is now $ 78 a barrel , down from more than $ 90 a barrel in *september*
experts say it *'ll* fall again - but prof @entity9 *admits* £ 1 pumps still ' distant '
