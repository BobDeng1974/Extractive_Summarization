by @entity0 on first glance , you might be forgiven for thinking you 'd stumbled across an impressive piece of wildlife art. the fine detail - right down to the elephant 's trunk and eyes - shows the perfect outline of the gigantic beast			1
but this is not the work of an artist			2
nor is it likely to remain in the spot where it was found for too much longer			2
animal art : this incredibly detailed imprint of the elephants was left in the sand when the beast arose from its slumber this incredible image shows the imprint of @entity25 , an eight - year - old @entity27 elephant , where it fell asleep in the sand at @entity30			1
staff at the zoo were amazed when they ventured into the elephants ' enclosure and found the perfectly - preserved impression of the animal 's head in the ground			1
the indentation is so clear , it even shows the fine detail of the ridges on the animal 's trunk , as well as its ear and eyes			1
the enclosure 's two elephants had fallen asleep on the ground , side - by - side , and - judging by the imprint - @entity25 did not appear to move too much during its jumbo slumber			1
and , in another stroke of luck , it did n't seem to disturb the impressive artwork when it arose from its snooze			2
@entity59 slumber : two elephants sleep side - by - side on the sand in their enclosure at @entity30 elephants lie down on their sides to sleep for around four hours a night and usually turn over at least once			1
even elephants that live in a zoo have a natural instinct to be aware of predators , which causes them to wake during their sleep as often as every half hour			0
they tend to have something to eat and then go back to sleep			0
due to their weight , elephants are forced to switch sides during their sleep			0
the mass of their bodies is so much that it puts pressure on their bones , causing pain and discomfort			0
the animals are also very light sleepers			0
if there were a sudden loud noise - either in the wild or in a zoo - an elephant would quickly be on its feet			0
in their natural habitat , a herd of elephants would not sleep at the same time			0
there would always be at least one keeping watch			0
