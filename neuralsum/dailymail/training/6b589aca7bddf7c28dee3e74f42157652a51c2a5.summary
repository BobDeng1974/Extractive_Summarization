click here for the latest leaderboard from @entity2 @entity3 take note			1
@entity5 is looking down on the rest of the field from a great height after consigning black fridays to the ether in the most spectacular manner imaginable — at @entity2			1
the @entity11 had wielded her stiletto by informing the world via social media that she could finally wear her heels for the first time in three years			2
trust her former fiance @entity18 to respond by showing a clean pair to everyone at @entity21 and banishing all talk about what the heck happens to him on fridays			1
size does n’t matter in golf , and certainly not when you play like the @entity29			1
here was a vivid demonstration of all the cruel beauty links golf possesses			2
pity all the ball strikers who had the worst of the weather on thursday afternoon and again on friday morning			1
those in that half of the draw , such as defending champion @entity64 , world no 1 @entity55 and leading home hope @entity56 , must have played a golf course that was three or four shots harder over the first 36 holes			2
as if @entity18 does n’t have enough going for him , they must have thought			2
how helpless they must have felt as @entity5 went on one of his usual thursday rampages on friday			1
this morning , something like a meteorological armageddon is due to visit these parts , with six hours of heavy rain predicted			2
so @entity18 may well have soft greens to play with when he goes out in the third round			1
has fate already decreed the destination of the @entity79 ? mind you , it ’s one thing for @entity82 to offer a helping hand ; quite another to take full advantage			2
there were plenty of form players in @entity5 ’s half of the draw who did n’t capitalise , including the highly fancied @entity91 and @entity92			1
and then there ’s @entity94			2
struggling for form : @entity94 shot a five - over - par round of 77 to leave him just inside the cut - mark at @entity2 in @entity98 getting out of the long stuff : @entity94 watches his shot from the rough on the tenth hole at @entity102 in @entity98 during his second round the @entity49 ripped up his blueprint for @entity98 but it backfired spectacularly			1
in five rounds at @entity98 he had used a driver on only two occasions			0
here he used it on both the first and second holes and the result was he double bogeyed the former and bogeyed the latter			0
he could probably have taken a seven iron off both tees and done better than that			0
thereafter the driver remained sheathed for a while and a more customary service was resumed			0
@entity118 followed par but that start had hurt him deeply			1
the first hole on this course for the members is the third in @entity2			1
how @entity94 ( right ) must have wished it was the first for him as well			0
by the time he got to the 17th , he was still after his first birdie of the day			2
forced to gamble , out came the driver			0
another horrific slice and his ball disappeared out of bounds			0
reload time and this one was a duck hook			0
the resultant triple bogey seven meant he needed to birdie the last to make the cut			2
sensibly he left the driver in the bag			0
he was six over par on the four holes where he ’d used it			2
by the side of the par five 18th green in two , he holed a tricky seven - footer to avoid the ignominy of consecutive missed cuts for the first time as a professional			1
beautiful day : @entity5 and his caddie @entity150 wait on the eight fairway before he secured his third birdie of a highly impressive round beautiful day : @entity5 watches his tee shot on the tenth on an afternoon of fine weather at @entity21 as he took a five shot lead scouting : @entity5 lines up his putt at the fifth hole on an impressive display at @entity21 as he established a decent lead by the side of the par five 18th green in two , he holed a tricky seven - footer to avoid the ignominy of consecutive missed cuts for the first time as a professional			1
clearly , those in the unlucky half of the draw have plenty of catching up to do			0
@entity55 is nine behind , while it was rough luck on @entity177 and @entity64			0
both shot rounds of 70 which were highly commendable in the morning but were rendered average in the afternoon as they trail by 10 and 12 shots respectively			0
it ’s not just @entity5 they have to catch either , but a stack of good players as well from the draw ’s most favourable half			1
four shots behind are two @entity188 in @entity190 @entity189 and @entity192 @entity191 and two @entity49 in @entity193 and @entity194			1
the wind was still blowing significantly when @entity5 ’s approach to the opening hole failed to hold the green and he did n’t get up and down for a par. all those ugly stats were whirling in the brain : 59 under par for first rounds ; seven over for second			1
@entity5 responded with three pars before taking up the birdie on offer at the long fifth			1
now the wind was dropping and the glint in @entity5 ’s eye could be seen a mile off			1
he knew he had been presented with a massive opportunity			0
easy does it : a successful shot from the rough on the 12th hole meant that @entity5 was able to maintain his lead at the top of the leaderboard versatile : it was a great day for @entity5 as he set up a lead that any of the opposition from the field will struggle to claw him back in from a pheasant running across the eighth green seemed appropriate as @entity5 made three birdies in four holes around the turn			1
the man who won the @entity231 by eight shots and the 2012 @entity233 by seven was pulling away once more , and history has moved into view again			0
only two players have won three majors at an earlier age and they just happen to go by the @entity240 names of @entity94 and @entity241			0
on his 28th birthday , @entity242 did his best to conjure up some support over the weekend by revealing he is a lifelong @entity245 fan			1
it would be wrong to underestimate him , too			0
think what another @entity247 of similar age and similar status at the time did at @entity252 in 2010 , when @entity253 pulled away from the field			0
@entity242 showed his liking for links golf when he opened with a pair of 69s at @entity2 at @entity259 ’s in 2011 — his first - ever major			1
these 36 holes were more impressive however			0
to emerge from his half of the draw with a five under par total was a great effort			2
the next best from his half was @entity55 on three under			0
finally , no one would begrudge @entity268 being in the kinder half of the draw			0
at 64 years of age he followed up his opening 71 with a 73 to make the cut			0
the greatest links golfer of all time has still got it			0
focus : the @entity29 watches his tee shot on the fourth hole during the second round			1

@entity5 went into the second round of @entity2 as the *overnight* leader on six under par
he doubled that tally with another brilliant round on friday
@entity29 *overcame* early *wobble* to lead the @entity188 charge at a *blustery* royal @entity245
he *reclaimed* the lead with a birdie on the *downwind* par - five fifth hole - *narrowly* missing from 40 feet for eagle
and he then went two ahead with another birdie on the sixth as he took control on ' *freaky* friday '
on the ninth hole a pheasant ran across the green before @entity5 stood up and *drained* the putt
birdie on the 10th helped to further his lead ahead of @entity311 in second place
friday demons put aside with a birdie to move him four clear on the 15th before another on the 18th
@entity5 is looking to complete three - quarters of a *career* @entity318 by winning @entity2 at @entity21
