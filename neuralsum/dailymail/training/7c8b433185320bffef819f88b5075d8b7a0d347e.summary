it looks like the @entity2 's change of scenery is getting to be too much for the @entity4 famously pert head of hair			1
the entertainment reporter 's mane is normally well - tamed and artfully coiffed , giving off the air of a casual yet skilful mastery of the mane			1
having a full head of hair is an achievement for any man , a fact which does n't escape @entity4 , who is normally vigilant about the appearance and maintenance of his tresses			2
however , it looks like the @entity21 is holding one over @entity4 ' @entity23 , as the tv personality appeared a little worse for wear and more than a little tousled by the change of hemisphere during every live crossover last week			0
however , it 's not the first time @entity4 has faced a bad hair day			1
last year co-host @entity47 declared @entity23 's nebulously hovering hair ' wild ' and insinuated the veteran of @entity50 had been drinking the night before			0
appearing on the @entity2 during the week from the @entity21 while @entity23 might have called the description ' a bit rough ' , the same could be said for the appearance of his hair throughout the week			0
his enigmatic hairstyle may not be as impervious to the elements as once thought , and may prove that @entity23 is only human after all			0
well - dressed and well - worn : @entity23 on the today show last week			2

today show entertainment reporter had a serious case of bad hair
@entity4 ' famous *quiff* *flopped* and flailed in the wind
his entertainment *offsider* @entity66 could n't stop laughing
