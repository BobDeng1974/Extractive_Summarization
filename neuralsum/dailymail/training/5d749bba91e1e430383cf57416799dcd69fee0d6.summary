doctors are calling on the health secretary to authorise a life - saving vaccine on the @entity3 that protects children against meningitis @entity5 @entity7 , the first jab to protect against the main cause of life - threatening bacterial meningitis , has been rejected so far on cost grounds			1
dozens of children a year are killed by meningitis b - some within hours - but more than 100 doctors , nurses and scientists have warned that the vaccine might never be widely used			1
doctors are calling on the health secretary to authorise a life - saving vaccine on the @entity3 that protects children against meningitis b a medical funding formula employed by the government ’s official medical advisers to determine whether it can be routinely given to children says it is unlikely to be cost effective ‘ at any price ’			1
jabs are available privately at £ 75 a dose and children will need four doses , although makers @entity33 have offered the @entity3 an undisclosed discount			0
the @entity35 ( @entity35 ) , which rejected the vaccine in october , is due to re-evaluate its decision shortly			0
a letter signed by 118 leading doctors calls on @entity40 to veto the advisory body and accept the lives of children are more important than economic arguments			1
a letter signed by 118 leading doctors calls on @entity40 to veto the advisory body and accept the lives of children are more important than economic arguments @entity49 , a consultant in paediatric intensive care at @entity51 , in @entity52 , who coordinated the letter , said : ‘ the @entity53 has among the worst child health outcomes in @entity55			1
@entity40 can help improve this by authorising the introduction of a new vaccine for @entity59 , which is the leading cause of bacterial meningitis in the @entity53			1
‘ it has been made available for use privately to those who can afford it , but it is a cause for concern that after years of research , a life - saving vaccine which could significantly increase protection offered to all our children , could be shelved			1
’ the @entity53 has one of the highest rates of meningitis b in the world , affecting around 1,870 people each year			1
anyone can get infected , with one in 10 people dying and one in three survivors suffering life - changing disability such as limb loss , brain damage and epilepsy			1
it kills more children under five than any other infectious disease in the @entity53 , while teenagers are also more at risk than other age groups			0
some experts say the vaccine , which protects against 88 per cent of strains , could already have saved 60 to 80 lives if it had been introduced last year			1
others have attacked the @entity35 ’s decision because it measures health care in economic rather than humanistic terms			0
‘ we have no qualms about administering expensive treatments such as surgery and chemotherapy to some very sick cancer patients who will see only a minor extension of their life span at best ’ said professor @entity100 , of @entity101 , @entity102 in the @entity103			0
he said , in an article in @entity113 , the jab was being blocked by ‘ hypothetical financial concerns of cost - effectiveness ’			2
critics say the calculation used by @entity120 health economists results in a value placed on a child ’s life of just 27 years , meaning the benefits of saving a child who may live for another 60 years , and the long - term care costs if a victim is left badly disabled are not properly accounted for			2
neither is the severe effect of the disease on parents ’ lives and @entity3 litigation costs			0
it can cost up to £ 3 million in support and treatment for each survivor			0
figures show £ 28 million compensation went to families of children left permanently disabled by meningitis missed by @entity142 between 2008 and 2012			2
the @entity35 used an internationally recognised formula known as quality - adjusted life years ( @entity145 ) to assess @entity7			1
a qaly assesses how many extra months or years of life of a reasonable quality a person might gain as a result of a treatment			0
to be cost - effective , any new vaccine , cancer medicine or heart treatment should cost no more than £ 20 - 30,000 for every qaly it saves			2
the @entity35 concluded the @entity157 vaccine did not meet the economic criteria at any level			0
however , a @entity161 - funded study last year concluded the qaly system of assessing new treatments was flawed			2
professor @entity164 , professor of paediatrics , @entity166 , who was involved in producing the new jab , said if the @entity35 ’s stance had applied to a new vaccine against meningitis c in 1999 , the disease would not have been virtually wiped out by now			1
he said : ‘ the @entity35 ’s reasons - the lack of cost - effectiveness , uncertainties on its effectiveness to prevent disease and decrease person to person spread - are so similar to the unknowns surrounding the successful implementation of the @entity183 vaccine that many will argue that there is blatant inconsistency			2
’ public health minister @entity187 said : ‘ a new vaccine against meningitis b has been licensed , but the @entity35 , our independent group of vaccine experts , is currently looking at evidence and working with the scientific community , interested groups and the manufacturer of the vaccine to find ways to resolve any uncertainties about the drug			0
‘ we will then be able to come to a clear answer on introducing the vaccine to the @entity3			0
’ @entity203 , chief executive of the @entity205 charity , said the @entity35 should use ‘ special circumstances ’ to justify approval , which include the severity of the disease			0
she said ‘ with the devastating impact of this disease , a decision based purely on cost - effectiveness is not appropriate			0
‘ @entity213 lost is lives lost and we are grateful to all the medical professionals and scientists for adding their voice by signing the letter calling on the health secretary to make the right decision for children in the @entity53			0
‘ while the vaccine is now available privately , parents should not have to make the stark choice of whether they feed their children , keep them warm or protect them from meningitis with the vaccine costing hundreds of pounds			1

@entity7 is the first jab to protect against the main cause of life - threatening bacterial meningitis
