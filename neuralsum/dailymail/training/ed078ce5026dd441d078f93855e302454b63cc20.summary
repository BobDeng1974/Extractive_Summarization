by @entity1 reporter published : 17:52 est , 15 july 2012 updated : 09:19 est , 16 july 2012 @entity3 's campaign said on sunday that president @entity4 is willing to say anything to win a second term and should say he 's sorry for attacks on the @entity9 's successful career at a private equity firm			1
but the president was adamant about his stance saying , ' no , we will not apologize , ' adding that if @entity3 wants credit for his business leadership , he also needs to take responsibility			2
questions about @entity3 's tenure at @entity20 and the fortune he earned there have dogged the former @entity23 governor as @entity4 and his allies have said the @entity26 - based firm shipped jobs overseas			1
@entity3 's advisers , trying to explain the discrepancies between @entity3 's account and federal documents , offered fresh explanations to shift the campaign back to more comfortable ground			1
should @entity4 apologize for attacks on @entity3 's private equity background ? ' he actually retired retroactively at that point , ' @entity3 adviser @entity48 said			1
' he ended up not going back to the firm after his time in @entity36			0
so he was actually retired from @entity20			1
' a second adviser , @entity52 , said @entity3 had no choice but to have his name listed on @entity56 documents as he sought to transfer the company 's leadership to partners			2
' the reason that there is a document that had ... his signature is because , during that transition from 1999 to 2002 ... there was a duty to sign those documents , ' @entity52 said			0
the exact role @entity3 played at the firm between 1999 and 2001 is important not only because critics have raised questions about his truthfulness , but also because @entity72 was sending jobs overseas during that period			2
' want to know ' : in @entity75 on saturday , @entity4 said , ' no , we will not apologize , ' about remarks made from the president and his allies that @entity3 oversaw the @entity26 - based firm as it shipped jobs overseas the president said @entity3 must square his explanation			1
' mr. @entity3 claims he 's mr. fix - it for the economy because of his business experience , so i think voters entirely legitimately want to know what is exactly his business experience , ' @entity4 told @entity92 in @entity93 , @entity75 , in an interview taped saturday and posted on the station 's website sunday ' mr. @entity3 is now claiming he was n't there at the time except his filings with the @entity56 listing says he was the ceo , chairman and president of the company			1
' @entity4 's advisers said that story wo n't sell voters			0
' either you 're the ceo , president , chairman of the board of @entity20 as you attest to the @entity56 or he 's telling the @entity111 people he bears no responsibility for that , ' deputy campaign manager @entity106 said			2
' both those things ca n't be true			0
either you 're in charge or you 're not			0
' @entity3 has insisted he was not involved with @entity20 during the time it sent jobs overseas and had no day - to - day responsibility for the company			1
he said he wanted an apology from the president for implying otherwise			0
' do or say anything ' : @entity48 , @entity3 's senior adviser who spoke on @entity125 's @entity124 on sunday ( pictured ) has said @entity4 was being unfair because @entity3 had retired when jobs were sent overseas ' no , we will not apologize , ' @entity4 told the tv station			1
@entity106 said @entity3 should take the advice - stop whining - that he gave his opponents during the @entity9 primary			1
' instead of whining about what the @entity4 campaign is saying , why do n't you just put the facts out there and let people decide instead of trying to hide them ? ' @entity106 said			0
documents place @entity3 in charge of @entity20 from 1999 to 2001 , a period in which the company outsourced jobs and ran companies that fell into bankruptcy			1
@entity3 has tried to distance himself from this period in @entity20 's history , saying on financial disclosure forms he had no active role in @entity20 as of february 1999			1
but at least three times since then , @entity20 listed @entity3 as the company 's ' controlling person , ' as well as its ' sole shareholder , sole director , chief executive officer and president			1
' one of those documents - as late as february 2001 - lists @entity3 's ' principal occupation ' as @entity20 's managing director			1
' in charge or not ' : @entity4 's deputy campaign manager @entity106 ( right ) and @entity3 's senior campaign advisor @entity52 debate @entity3 's role int he overseas jobs issue on @entity166 's @entity165 ' he 's very willing to take credit for everything good that he thinks happened after that point that @entity20 was involved in , but he 's not willing to take responsibility for this , ' @entity4 strategist @entity167 said , echoing comments @entity4 and his allies leveled in a weeklong blitz about @entity20			1
sen. @entity176 , a @entity9 from @entity177 , said @entity4 's attacks cheapen the presidency and are an attempt to distract voters from @entity4 's record in office			2
' with these attacks , it shows that he 's just a small politician and running on small - ball politics at a time when our country is facing grave , grave challenges , ' @entity176 said			2
added @entity48 : ' we now know this president will say or do anything to keep the highest office in the land - even if it means demeaning the highest office in the land			2
' @entity3 's campaign released a television ad sunday asking why the president had stopped talking about hope and change , his signature message during the 2008 campaign , and criticizing him for a barrage of negative ads against @entity3			1
@entity4 's allies also pushed @entity3 to release more than the one year of tax returns he has shared			2
@entity212 mayor @entity211 , @entity4 's former top @entity213 aide , noted @entity3 released 23 years of taxes to 2008 @entity9 nominee @entity215 so he could be considered as a vice presidential nominee			1
@entity3 and his family go on a boat ride in @entity177 as a debate continues on @entity3 's exact role at @entity20 , where the presidential candidate earned much of his fortune			1
to determine his truthfulness ' @entity215 's people looked at it and went with @entity226 ' as the no. 2 on the ticket that year			0
' whatever is in there is far worse than the first year , ' @entity211 said			0
' the @entity3 campaign is n't stupid			2
they have decided that it 's better to get attacked on a lack of transparency , lack of accountability to the @entity111 people , versus telling you what 's in those taxes			0
' @entity3 has refused and says that no amount of disclosure would satisfy his critics			0
but some in his party said the debate over @entity3 's wealth is distracting from the campaign			1
' he should release the tax returns tomorrow			0
you 've got to release six , eight , 10 years of back tax returns , ' said conservative @entity254 , joining the @entity9 who want to turn the page on stories about @entity3 's vast personal wealth			1
' take the hit for a day or two			0
' unless , as @entity4 's team hints , the returns prove disqualifying			0
' the costs of not releasing the returns are clear , ' conservative columnist @entity261 said			0
' therefore , he must have calculated there are higher costs to releasing them			0
