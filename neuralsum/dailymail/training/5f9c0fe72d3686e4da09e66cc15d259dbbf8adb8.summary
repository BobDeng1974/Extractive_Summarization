an alleged @entity1 hate preacher has been arrested over claims he is the terror mastermind who recruited the two @entity5 jihad ' poster girls ' and more than 160 others who joined @entity7			1
@entity8 , 17 , and @entity9 , 16 , became radicalised through the cell led by unemployed benefits claimant @entity12 , 33 , who lived with his pregnant wife and five children in a council flat in @entity16 , @entity5			1
it was stuffed with jewellery , cash and savings books worth a fortune when it was stormed by @entity5 's elite heavily - armed police special forces team @entity23			0
it is claimed they now want to return home - but it is too late the valuables had all been provided by @entity40 radicalised by the preacher and his cronies in a network that reportedly extended across the country and into the rest of @entity46			1
his arrest has been seen as a major blow against the terrorist group 's activities			0
according to security forces , @entity12 , whose real name is @entity53 , not only recruited the two girls that became the public face of jihad - but was also involved in a further 166 defections of @entity46 youngsters to fight in holy war			1
it 's also claimed he raised a ' significant ' amount of cash for terrorists			1
security service insiders claim that he was not only one of 200 leading jihadists , but was also one of the leaders of the so called ' @entity72 cell ' based in the @entity74 district of @entity16 that was ' one of the most important logistic and financial support centres for jihadist activities in @entity46 ' , according to a ' vecernje novosti ' , a local newspaper in @entity72			1
@entity5 has been concerned for years over fears that the country was becoming a hub for terrorist activities after inviting thousands of @entity40 refugees into the country during the breakup of the former @entity88			0
the moved provided a fertile breeding ground for @entity12 and his network			1
the influential @entity5 newspaper the @entity92 , claimed that ' there was scarcely a single recruit in @entity46 for @entity95 in which he and his group were not involved '			1
originally from the small @entity99 town of @entity100 , @entity12 was known in @entity72 as a preacher of hatred and intolerance , who very soon found himself allied with the extreme form of @entity1 known as @entity105			1
according to @entity5 anti-terrorism authorities , @entity12 appeared on their radar more than three years ago , when he began uploading videos onto his @entity111 channel			1
hate preacher : @entity12 would approach fathers at friday prayers and tell them it was their duty to provide wives for fighters in @entity119 and @entity30 , it is claimed although officially unemployed , he was observed driving expensive fast cars			1
for the past two years , intelligence officials have been tapping his communications , monitoring his phone calls and building up a picture of his network - which then prompted the arrests on friday november 28			0
one of those connections is allegedly a direct line to the caliph of @entity7 terrorism , @entity131			2
investigators saw a constant stream of @entity134 @entity40 while monitoring the @entity136 mosque during their operation on @entity12			2
@entity134 is the fastest - growing @entity1 movement in the world			0
it is rooted in the 19th century where it emerged as a way of combating the spread of @entity46 ideas and values			2
but in recent years , it has come to be associated with the jihad of extremist groups that advocate the killing of innocent civilians			0
security services recorded a constant stream of @entity134 preachers , often accompanied by @entity156 fighters travelling up from @entity72 , to the mosque and the imam has been appearing in online videos revealing that it is every @entity40 's duty to join jihad if an @entity1 state is under attack from non-believers			1
it is not even necessary to ask parents for permission , because even that normally essential parental duty takes second place to the duty to fight			0
this is exactly what happened in the case of @entity8 and @entity9 , who left only a note for their worried parents			1
it was at underground mosques like these that the teenage girls were recruited and the signs were there that they were in danger even before they fled			2
messages painted on the walls at school urging fellow believers to follow the call to jihad were traced back to the girls			2
nobody heeded that warning until their parents discovered the notes in their bedrooms			0
' do n't look for us , we have gone to fight in the holy war			0
' vanished : the girls disappeared one day and just left notes to their parents in their bedrooms			0
' do n't look for us , we have gone to fight in the holy war ' , they read @entity204 brides : the two girls in their new life in a pic posted online			2
they attended sermons given by @entity12 meanwhile , @entity8 and @entity9 attended @entity12 's sermons - in which he said it was a woman 's duty to support men fighting jihad			1
@entity12 would even approach fathers attending friday prayers to tell them that he had many contacts looking for wives			2
@entity8 and @entity9 were radicalised within a few short months and travelled to @entity30 to marry @entity220 girls have now revealed they made a mistake , and desperately want to return home			1
but they are married already , and also both reportedly pregnant , so the chances of ever returning home or indeed seeing their parents seem remote			0
@entity12 and 12 others were picked up in the raids involving hundreds of officers			0
they have been remanded in custody for a further two weeks while the investigations continue			0
according to state prosecutor @entity235 , the charges they are being investigated over are on suspicion of membership of a terrorist organisation , in ' connection with the recruiting of young people for the civil war in @entity30 '			0
the lawyer for @entity12 denies all the charges while police and prosecutors sift through the evidence , and begin questioning his associates			0
publicly they say they have struck a major blow against a likely terrorist network - but the arresting officers are clearly worried that there may be others at large .			0

@entity12 , 33 , who lived in @entity16 on benefits arrested over claims he recruited 166 young @entity46 to join jihad for @entity7
*includes* @entity8 , 17 and @entity9 , 16 , who became @entity7 ' poster girls ' after they ran away to become brides for terror fighters
