the father of @entity1 has told of his anguish at not having done more to extinguish the extreme views that led his son to massacre 77 people in @entity6 in 2011			1
@entity8 's dreams are still haunted by the image of his son indiscriminately shooting students at point - blank range on the island of @entity13 as he trampled over their classmates ' corpses , in what became the largest killing spree by a single person in history			1
yet while his nightmares are filled with visions of a monster , his memories are of an angelic five - year - old boy who enjoyed playing in the woods near his home and going on play - dates with his friends			2
yet he is still my son			0
i feel sorry for him because i still think that there is some humanity in him , ' mr @entity8 told the @entity42 from his home in @entity44 , @entity45			1
@entity8 detonated a bomb in central @entity47 on july 22 , 2011 , killing eight , then took a boat to an island where the ruling @entity50 were holding a summer camp and shot dead 69 more people , mostly teenagers			1
@entity54 ? yet while his nightmares are filled with visions of a monster , his memories are of an angelic five - year - old boy ( above ) who enjoyed playing in the woods near his home he was sentenced to 21 years in jail , the maximum in @entity6 though the term can be extended if there is deemed to be a risk he would commit new crimes			1
he now refuses contact with his father , unless mr @entity70 joins his fascist one - man terror cell			2
' last year i phoned the prison to ask if i could visit him , ' he told the paper			0
' four months later , i received a letter			0
it was cold and formal			0
he addressed it to ' mr @entity8 ' and signed it ' @entity1 '			1
' he was pursuing his ridiculous ideas			0
he said he 'd only accept a visit if i became a fascist and joined his political regime			0
he wo n't have contact with me			0
' @entity8 , 78 , has had only intermittent contact with his son since losing a legal battle for custody after a divorce from @entity92 ' mother when he was four			1
now he wonders what more he could have done to win custody of his son and prevent his son from becoming ' so evil '			2
' at that time there was no precedent for a father to gain custody of a child after a divorce			0
i had to accept that his mother could keep him , ' he said			0
' i think if i had fought harder , if i had taken him with me , he would definitely have been another person today			0
' he said at first @entity8 showed no signs of extremism , rather , he seemed a happy child			2
he said when @entity8 was 11 , he moved back to @entity47 from @entity106 to be closer to him			1
' we had good times together but it lasted only until 16 , and then i lost contact with him , ' he said			1
' he became a member of a gang			0
' evil : @entity8 detonated a bomb in central @entity47 on july 22 , 2011 , killing eight , then took a boat to an island where the ruling @entity50 were holding a summer camp and shot dead 69 more people , mostly teenagers happy family ? with sister @entity120 and mother @entity121 , who took custody of @entity8 following the divorce he said he did n't hear from him until he received a brief phone call from his son saying he was ' doing well ' with a company and two employees			1
mr @entity8 is racked with guilt over not making more effort to see his son during that time			1
in 2011 , he retired to @entity45 with his second wife @entity131 , 74			1
he heard nothing of his son until images began appearing on televisions across the world of a man dressed in a policeman 's uniform walking calmly through @entity13 island shooting dead anyone who crossed his path			1
smiling killer : @entity8 was sentenced to 21 years in jail , the maximum in @entity6 , though the term can be extended if there is deemed to be a risk he would commit new crimes but even then , mr @entity8 did not connect his son with the massacre			1
it was not until the killer 's name was revealed that mr @entity8 understood the horrifying truth			2
' i was quite paralysed , i was in shock , i understood nothing , ' he told @entity157 last month			0
' i was in a sort of coma			0
' but he says one of his greatest fears is the fact his son 's fascist , anti-immigrant views seem to be getting ever more extreme in jail			2
but nevertheless , every thought he has about his son and that unspeakable summer 's day in 2011 always comes back to one question : ' i have asked myself , ' am i to blame for him becoming so extreme ? ' i ask , ' could i have prevented it in some way ? ' ' i do n't have an easy answer			2
it is very difficult being the father of a mass murderer			0
it worries me all the time			0

@entity8 , 78 , lost custody of son when @entity180 was four years old
moved to @entity45 and saw little of him until returning to @entity47 when he was 11
but son cut off contact at 16 , and joined gang as far - right views *fomented*
@entity1 killed 77 people on july 22 2011 on @entity13 island and in @entity47
he was sentenced to 21 years in jail , but likely to die there as no *remorse*
