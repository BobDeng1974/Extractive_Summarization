by @entity0 walking along a tightrope would be terrifying enough for most people			2
add two speeding trucks at either end of the cable and the feat suddenly seems more like an impossible scene from a @entity10 blockbuster			2
but for one young woman it provided the perfect adrenaline - inducing stunt to show off her impressive highlining skills			2
@entity16 slackliner @entity15 , 23 , became the first person to perform such a death - defying exploit on an unopened stretch of a new motorway in @entity21 , with no oncoming traffic			1
scroll down to see the video death - defying : @entity16 stunt woman @entity15 , 23 , risks her life as she becomes the first person to cross a high wire between two moving trucks relieved : having survived the dramatic stunt , miss @entity15 said that this particular one was the most terrifying that she had even done after fastening the tightrope between the two trucks , miss @entity15 limbers up and crosses the wire while both vehicles are still			1
but the feat suddenly becomes much harder as they speed along the fresh tarmac with the central barrier of the road separating them			0
miss @entity15 makes her first attempt and just a few feet in wobbles and falls , narrowly clinging on to the wire and hauling herself back up			1
limbering up : miss @entity15 practices the dramatic stunt while the two wagons are parked up and a crash mat is below her film crews who have worked on blockbusters such as @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49 , prepare to capture the crossing nerves : miss @entity15 - a world record holder in highlining - psyches herself up as she prepares for the most difficult stunt of her career the stunt woman makes good progress on stationary practice runs , signalling that she 's ready to attempt the same crossing while the wagons are rolling with the wind speed battering her , and legs shaking vigorously , she continues her precarious walk between the two wagons			1
in a dramatic finish with seconds to spare , she leaps onto the wagon before it speeds through a tunnel			1
miss @entity15 , who is the world record holder for highlining , said that the stunt was one of the most terrifying she has done			1
cautious : as the trucks pull off , miss @entity15 checks everything is in place before she makes her first tentative steps across the rope progress : the stunt appears to be going well , with the daredevil holding up well despite the wind battering her and shaking the rope a brief wobble on the rope and the stunt woman drops to her knees as she struggles to stay upright disaster : one wrong foot placement and @entity88 slips , only just managing to hold on to the rope to prevent her from dangling upside down by a safety catch on her ankle near miss : with her legs in the air , miss @entity15 swings on the cable desperately trying to keep alive her adrenaline - inducing crossing she added : ' i 'm used to heights , long lines and lines that sway in the wind			1
but those lines are firmly anchored to cliff - faces			0
' walking a line attached to two moving points is something quite different			0
' @entity106 , who normally works with stunts in films such as @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49 , worked with @entity109 to create the stunt			2
he said : ' and here was i thinking that every imaginable stunt had already been done			2
the fact is that nobody has ever before walked a line between two moving trucks			0
having regained some stability , the balancing expert is able to continue the exploit with the trucks speeding along the unopened motorway in @entity21 the sun shines down on the athlete as she adopts a crouching pose to lower her centre of gravity and keep her balance half way along the rope do n't look down ! a shot from @entity88 's helmet camera shows the view she will have had of the road below , which had no traffic on it at the time of the feat tension : the experienced truckers are pictures of concentration as they use their own steady hands and feet to keep their vehicles at a consistent speed ' it felt like an enormous challenge , and it 's challenges that get me going			0
' stunts are not for the reckless			0
you have to prepare for the worst possible scenario at all times , and plan for how to deal with it			0
' preparation down to the tiniest detail , meticulous planning - they 're absolutely vital			0
' the feat was recorded in a dramatic video against the orange hue of the sun. miss @entity15 is almost across the wire as the wagons approach a tunnel			1
if she does n't make it across she will be killed and if the vehicles begin to slow she will lose her balance and fall anyway with inches to spare @entity88 jumps for her life and makes it to the opposite truck just as it enters the tunnel phew : miss @entity15 completes the first ever slackline crossing between two moving vehicles we made it ! miss @entity15 raises her hands in celebration after completing the dramatic stunt video director @entity184 said : ' my favorite kind of shoot is when someone tells me something is impossible to film			1
when i hear no , it makes me want to move mountains			0
' @entity15 is the same way			1
tell her ' no ' and it will fuel her			0
she humbled and amazed myself and the entire crew with her courage			0
' this stunt started off as a way to test the precision of @entity200 massive 16 - wheeled trucks and ended up being just as much a testament to guts and courage			2

@entity15 , 23 , completes stunt with seconds to spare before tunnel
