the @entity1 's three remaining sides in @entity3 's top club competition found out who they will face in the @entity5 last 16 on monday			1
@entity6 will go toe to toe with former club @entity8 , after expressing his wish to see @entity11 line up against the @entity14 side			1
meanwhile @entity15 and @entity16 face harder opposition in @entity18 and @entity19 respectively			1
@entity20 will defend their crown against @entity23 's @entity22			1
host commentator and we finish with @entity26 vs @entity27			0
that 's a decent morning for the @entity30 sides i 'd suggest			0
@entity11 have a dream draw , while @entity15 say they wanted @entity18			1
@entity16 should n't really be fearing @entity19 this season , although that is the most daunting draw of the three			1
draw in full @entity18 vs @entity15 @entity16 vs @entity19 @entity37 vs @entity38 @entity40 vs @entity39 @entity22 vs @entity20 @entity41 vs @entity42 @entity11 vs @entity8 @entity26 vs @entity27 so here is the confirmation of @entity11 playing either @entity8 or @entity27 , and it is @entity6 's past employers			1
@entity41 ... get @entity42 ! ! ! what a morning for @entity6 ! brilliant news for @entity11 fans			1
@entity22 up next ... ... and excellent news for @entity11 as @entity20 will face the @entity49			1
@entity42 still in the hat			0
nice one for the hipsters , you 'd suggest			0
' all big games at this stage , ' @entity53 says before @entity37 are drawn out			0
brilliant , you ca n't make that up			0
and the @entity49 face @entity38			2
eh ? no ? now @entity16 are drawn ... against @entity19 ! ! ! @entity60 , i am so sorry			1
@entity61 ca n't wait , by the way			0
@entity18 are out first ... ... @entity15 ? it 's who @entity64 wanted ? and yes it is ! @entity15 ! they 've gone on and on about the specifics behind the convoluted rules of the draw , but here we go ! it 's on ! the camera has just panned to @entity73 , looking resplendent as ever and politely clapping as @entity74 continues with the tantalising rubbish			1
meanwhile - and make sure you 're sitting down for this - @entity77 says his 1997 triumph with @entity39 was the highlight of his career ! bullseye ! @entity82 fans , come and have a look at what you could 've won			0
@entity74 will conduct the draw alongside @entity87 and ambassador 1997 winner @entity77			2
there 's plenty of guff being spewed over in @entity91 at the moment			1
i sha n't bore you with the details			0
@entity42 , @entity22 , @entity39 and @entity37 make up a quarter of the draw			1
@entity74 said : ' i do n't think we should be surprised			0
@entity98 are the world champions and they perform very well			2
four very strong teams , even if some are n't performing in the @entity102			0
' the final is in @entity104 , of course			0
' it 's quite a simple draw in the sense that the group winners play against the runners - up			1
there are two additional conditions : teams of the same country or in the same group ca n't play each other			2
' we 're at the real heat of the competition			0
it 's felt here at the draw			0
there are eight nationalities represented with six former winners			0
' there are many ways for @entity6 to defend his record at @entity11 : two 4 - 1 wins in a week are a fair start			1
specious claims about the @entity5 , however , are not			1
‘ since i arrived we have played over 180 @entity5 games , ’ @entity6 said			2
‘ you will see that before then they did n’t play too many			0
’ there are a couple of guesses as to who @entity11 might get flying around the office			2
the most popular suggestion is they 'll probably be drawn against @entity42			0
@entity142 's law , but you would n't be surprised			0
i 'm not sure whether @entity15 are going to be overly bothered who they get today			2
@entity40 and @entity18 are the toughest tests in the unseeded pot - @entity64 said he actually wants the latter - and the @entity147 should breeze through			2
they 've been imperious all year			0
@entity26 , @entity37 and @entity41 make up the sides quaking in their proverbials			0
as an aside , @entity16 ca n't face @entity42 , while @entity11 are exempt from a going over by @entity39			1
they both avoid @entity1 leaders @entity15 , too			2
there will be a few nervous directors in @entity91 , not least those from the @entity155 and the @entity156			2
@entity11 and @entity16 are both here because they finished twice in their groups and have the great and the good of @entity161 football waiting for them , including @entity20 , @entity19 and @entity38			1
oh , plus @entity8 and @entity27			2
that 'd be nice , would n't it ? @entity165 's @entity164 was at the scene of one of @entity16 's best nights in @entity161 competition last week , and above is his match report as @entity172 's side progressed against all odds at @entity174			1
who does the sullen - looking @entity64 want ? find out here ... all this preamble , all this hype and how long does the actual draw take ? seven minutes ! click the link above for full coverage of who can get who and where the @entity30 trio may be going in february ... so , who are @entity82 @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity11 going to get in the last - 16 of the @entity5 ? the excitement is building , but perhaps not for poor old @entity186 , who 's bracing himself for the main event in @entity91 after this			1
