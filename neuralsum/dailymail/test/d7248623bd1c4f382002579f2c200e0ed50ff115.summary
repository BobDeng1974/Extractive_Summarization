@entity0 , @entity1 , @entity2 , @entity3 , @entity4 , @entity5			1
perhaps the biggest compliment to the man who would join the golfing gods this week is that his name does not look out of place among the pantheon			0
@entity5 could become just the sixth man to win the @entity13 at @entity14 on sunday , and while that represents the pinnacle of on - course achievement , he has designs on not just filling his trophy cabinet but becoming the true figurehead of his sport			1
that is the view of @entity23 , @entity25 ’s @entity24 captain extraordinaire , who sums up the attitude in this neat way : @entity5 is no @entity28			1
winning at all costs and to hell with the consequences is just not his style , unlike @entity34 's ruthless manager			2
‘ is it all about winning titles , is it all about the @entity28 way of “ i ’m going to get as many medals and titles as i can ” ? ’ ponders @entity23			1
‘ or is it , i ’m the no 1 player in the world , i represent the game of golf , am i going to become somebody like @entity4 did , an iconic figure in world sport , and try to introduce and propel the game forward ? @entity5 has designs on becoming the true figurehead of his sport , says @entity23			1
@entity5 goes into this week 's masters at @entity14 as favourite but he 's aiming for more than trophies @entity23 says @entity5 's ambitions are unlike @entity34 's relentless win - at - all - costs manager @entity28 @entity23 , @entity5 's @entity24 - winning coach , says the world no 1 aims to be an iconic figure in world sport ‘ my hunch knowing @entity5 is that it ’s more about representing that no 1 position , and bringing as many titles along with it as he can			1
’ @entity23 , by the way , is a die - hard @entity67 fan			1
and he knows @entity5 well			2
fellow sons of the @entity69 , @entity23 helped coax arguably the greatest round of @entity5 ’s life , the utter demolition of @entity74 ’s own golden boy , @entity73 , 5 & 4 at @entity75 last year			1
@entity23 speaks glowingly of @entity5 from their time together on the winning @entity24 team there were signs before the @entity24 that @entity5 was not just in single - minded pursuit of greatness , but had his eyes on the greater good			1
@entity23 wanted to give short and sharp tips to his young charge on how to prepare for @entity75 ; but @entity5 simply would n’t shut up about it			1
‘ i swear , i honestly could not have asked for one per cent more out of @entity5 , in the whole two years of @entity24 , ’ enthuses @entity23			1
‘ every time i had a chat with him , he was so engaged with it			0
often i ’d be walking away and he ’d be pulling me back to talk more			0
he wanted more and more , and he was sharing ideas , he was terrific			0
’ while it ’s easy to get carried away in the face of such extraordinary talent , @entity5 still has one giant leap to overcome			2
he must stand firm on the slippery slopes of @entity14 ’s rolling fairways and conquer the course that has beaten him up on two excruciating occasions , and where his best finish was eighth last year			1
@entity4 , meanwhile , has mastered the place four times			2
‘ @entity5 is evolving as a player , and he ’s evolving as a person too			2
he ’s not the finished article , even now at 25			0
it ’s not right to compare him to @entity4			2
what @entity4 has done in his career is a yardstick , @entity5 is still evolving towards that and every year he is getting better and better , but he still has a long way to go to meet the standards that @entity4 set			1
’ @entity23 , who will be at the masters in @entity14 commentating for @entity113 , the only place to watch all four days live , cites @entity4 ’s supreme patience as the hallmark of a true great – @entity5 glaringly lacked the latter during his final - round horror show in 2011			1
@entity23 walks with @entity119 and @entity5 as they prepared for the @entity121 @entity23 will be watching his former charges at the masters closely as a pundit for @entity113 four years on , however , @entity5 ’s rivals know they are battling to contain a different beast			1
‘ the one thing that @entity5 has proved is that he ’s able to learn from his mistakes and move on , ’ says @entity23 , who talks now of an ‘ aura ’ surrounding the man who will be going for his third major in a row after his @entity131 and @entity132 victories last summer			1
does @entity5 intimidate his opponents before a ball has even been struck ? ‘ yeah , i think a bit			2
not as much as @entity4 , but again he ’s evolving towards that			2
when @entity5 ’s driving the ball like he can , he ’s very intimidating			2
he knows he has the ability , when he finds that extra gear , that nobody else can match him			0
’ there is a word of warning , however			0
‘ it will be a matter of time before someone catches up with him and somebody will challenge him			0
@entity4 had that and then guys caught up with him			0
’ the men most likely to challenge @entity5 ’s bid for immortality are most likely to be a number of old @entity24 foes – although @entity4 will surely not be among them			1
@entity158 , the defending champion , a reformed and refocused @entity158 , the extraordinary 21 - year - old @entity159 @entity158 and @entity73 , if he has got over his humbling at @entity75 , all look most likely to push @entity5 hardest			2
@entity5 is intimidating for his opponents when he 's hitting the ball as he can , says @entity23 @entity4 returns to the fold for the masters but is n't expected to be challenging @entity5 for the green jacket masters defending champion @entity158 ( left ) and a reformed and refocused @entity158 @entity158 , the extraordinary @entity159 21 - year - old , is also considered among the 2015 title contenders ‘ a rival will be good for @entity5 , ’ insists @entity23			1
‘ if @entity158 steps up to the plate like some people are expecting him to , or @entity158 , or @entity73 , if some of those guys win a major , that ’ll only be good for him			0
@entity5 has reacted well to adversity and guys challenging him in the past			0
’ but the toughest opponent @entity5 could face in future might not come on the course , but from the voice within			0
‘ the biggest challenge that @entity5 has got is keeping the fire lit in his heart			0
that ’s the biggest challenge anybody would have			0
that ’s what made @entity4 phenomenal at the top for as long as he was			0
‘ at the moment @entity5 has it , he ’s had it for a number of years , he ’s got that incredible passion			0
keeping that lit for another 20 years is another question			0
we wo n’t know the answer , but that ’s his biggest challenge			0
’ that ’s why it ’s always handy to have a man like captain @entity23 around , to help fan those flames			1
this week , however , @entity5 is on his own			0
thankfully the fire is raging more than ever .			0

@entity24 - winning captain @entity23 speaks *highly* of @entity5
@entity206 wants to be ' an iconic figure in world sport , ' said @entity23
@entity5 's not all about winning titles , he wants to propel the game forward
@entity5 could be the sixth man to win the @entity13 at @entity14
he is the favourite for the masters , where his best finish there is eighth
@entity23 said @entity5 intimidates opponents , but not like @entity4 did
