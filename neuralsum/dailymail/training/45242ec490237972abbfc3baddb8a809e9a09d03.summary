by @entity0 with modern advertising boards showing video clips , messaging passersby and even interacting with viewers , it is difficult for a classic billboard to stand out			0
however , one board in @entity8 has been attracting attention after displaying odd slogans and messages as part of an art project			0
@entity14 , 50 , and fellow academic @entity15 contact an artist each month and ask them to write a message for their billboard , which is then displayed using heavy wooden letters			1
@entity14 , 50 , and @entity15 have taken over an old - fashioned billboard in @entity8 as an art project			1
in this post 11 - year - old @entity24 wonders about what to post on her new blog @entity28 used his message in april this year to take a swipe at social media and @entity33 users this message , written by @entity35 , displayed his phone number			2
if people called him , he would read verse to them , or listen to poems they wanted to read the notes , which have ranged from witty remarks to short poems and even two phone numbers , then stay up for a month before being replaced			1
one artist wrote the word ' poem ' in front of his phone number , then read verse to anyone who called or listened to poems they wanted to read to him			2
another artist also displayed his phone number with only a question mark above it , before speaking to people about a topic chosen by them			0
' he said the majority of calls were from people who wanted advice , ' @entity14 added			2
the messages , which are displayed on a metal rack and made using wooden letters , are left for a month before being taken down			0
this one , by @entity64 , was the first to be shown in january last year @entity14 says his favourite messages are self - referential , such as this one which offers stubborn viewers the chance to say sorry without having to actually say it another artist , @entity72 , also put up his phone number and spoke with callers over the course of the mother it stayed up			1
he said most of them phoned asking for advice other messages have included a swipe at @entity33 , a mad plan to announce births and deaths from a loudspeaker on hospital roofs , and one note which simply read : ' these words hold no power over you			1
' while most of the submissions come by direct invitation from @entity14 or @entity15 , they do occasionally take ideas via email , or directly from the internet			1
one of the most bizarre came from an 11 - year - old girl who wrote : ' ideas for my new blog : who invented tape , how were feelings discovered , when did ' " skinny " become fashionable ? ' the project is called the last @entity104 as a nod to the changing nature of advertising and text in general			0
@entity14 asks artists for messages to display on the boards , as well as collecting notes from around the internet			1
this post , by @entity116 , appeared last month in may @entity117 displayed this mad plan for loudspeakers on hospital roofs to make public announcements forgotten : this downbeat display remembers all of the hours that went into forgotten labours of love ' billboards like this take hours to erect and they stay there for a month , ' said @entity14 who believes ads such as these will soon become obsolete			2
he added : ' a month is a long time in today 's world of instant digital messaging			0
' @entity14 was educated at @entity134 , @entity135 and @entity136 and has exhibited work across the @entity138 and abroad			0
getting emotional : this billboard imagines a fight between intellect and emotion - with a clear winner buzzwords : photographer @entity145 describes images that would usually feature on a billboard in his note			0
