if , like me , you thought your @entity2 days ended about the same time you stopped wearing pigtails and carrying your packed lunch in a glittery pink lunchbox , then think again			1
turns out @entity2 is this season 's new style icon , and everyone from @entity9 to @entity10 and @entity11 is channeling the plastic princess ' look			1
@entity2 's style renaissance is all thanks to super-hip fashion designer @entity15 , who designs for the @entity17 label @entity18			1
he filled the catwalk with figure - hugging looks in bubble - gum pink , created colourful ' dolly ' accessories and even reworked the @entity18 logo in that familiar @entity2 typeface			1
i could n't resist joining in the fun , so this week i 've created a sugar - sweet @entity2 - inspired beauty look , with bold , baby - pink lips , and tons of sparkle and shimmer – just perfect for a fancy - dress party or a glam girly night out			1
@entity21 wanted to recreate the sugary sweet @entity2 look as seen on the catwalks of @entity18 @entity21 's barbie beauty step 1 : eyes once you 've applied your preferred base , get straight onto the eyes			1
begin by blending a soft nude shadow across your lids across my lids , to act as a base			0
i used @entity59 in @entity60 – the cream - to - powder formula of this eyeshadow means it 's smooth to apply but is also incredibly long - lasting			2
next , add a dusting of sparkle using @entity66 in @entity67			0
@entity21 has opted for high shine and heavy bronzer to give her cheeks a sculpted look glitters can be tricky and messy to work with , so to make things easier dab a small amount onto the back of your hand , then , using a fine eyeshadow brush , carefully dab the pigment over your eyelids to create glitzy sheen			2
apply a hint of glitter under the lower lash line too , for super-sparkly @entity2 lashes			2
to give your eyes extra definition , line your upper and lower lash lines with @entity90 in @entity91			0
finally , apply a few coats of @entity93 – perfect for those long , voluminous lashes that living dolls should have ! step 2 : cheeks barbie is famous for her gorgeous cheekbones , so add a touch of contour with @entity103 in @entity104 , dusted under the apples of your cheeks and across your temples			0
next up , for gorgeous shimmery cheekbones , you need to pack on the highlighter			0
@entity21 says that this look is great for both fancy dress or if you just fancy looking extra girly @entity9 was spotted in the @entity114 look at @entity115 ( left ) and @entity116 shared this image of her trying the trend on her @entity120 account ( right ) i used @entity122 , swirling the two shades in the compact together and blending the powder across the tops of my cheekbones for a gorgeously girly shimmer			1
finally , for a really sparkly finish , dust a hint of the too faced glitter pigment over your cheekbones			0
step 3 : lips key to this look is the bright baby - pink lip , as seen on the @entity18 catwalk			2
try @entity139 in @entity140 – it is a strongly pigmented pastel pink shade which means the colour really lasts			0
finally , to make your pout really pop , add a slick of @entity145 in the sugar - sweet baby - pink shade @entity147			0
@entity21 says that a bright lip with a strong pink pigment is essential for achieving the @entity2 vibe you can get all the products i used to create my @entity18 - inspired look online at @entity155			1
life in plastic , it 's fantastic ! on another fashion - related note , i 've booked my ticket to @entity162 at the @entity163 in december			0
i 'm really looking forward to getting a sneak peek into the new season 's top trends and of course indulging in a bit of retail therapy ! stay beautiful , love @entity21 xxx			2
