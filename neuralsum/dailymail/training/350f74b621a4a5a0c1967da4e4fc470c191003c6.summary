by @entity0 @entity1 : 19:28 est , 27 december 2013 @entity2 : 06:08 est , 28 december 2013 @entity3 will return to @entity5 reality show @entity4 in 2014 following his brief suspension for infammatory comments about homosexuality in @entity9			1
' after discussions with the @entity3 family , as well as consulting with numerous advocacy groups , @entity5 has decided to resume filming @entity4 later this spring with the entire @entity3 family , ' the network said in a statement			1
@entity3 was put on indefinite hiatus less than two weeks ago by @entity5 in response to the uproar following the interview			1
reinstated : @entity3 wo n't miss a day of filming after his brief hiatus was reversed by @entity5 the removal of the 67 - year - old patriarch from the show was lauded by gay rights organizations , but fans of the show denounced it as a violation of @entity3 's right to free speech			1
conservative supporters include @entity32 , who wrote in a @entity34 post : ' free speech is an endangered species			0
those intolerants ’ hatin ’ and taking on the @entity4 patriarch for voicing his personal opinion are taking on all of us			2
' @entity5 initially took action after @entity3 's comments caused uproar , saying his views were ' disappointing ' and that @entity5 has always been ' strong supporters and champions of the lgbt community			1
' now , the network says the family has made it clear that they are sorry if they caused any offense with the patriarch 's remarks			2
' while @entity3 ’s comments made in the interview reflect his personal views based on his own beliefs , and his own personal journey , he and his family have publicly stated they regret the “ coarse language ” he used and the mis - interpretation of his core beliefs based only on the article			1
he also made it clear he would “ never incite or encourage hate			0
” we at @entity66 expressed our disappointment with his statements in the article , and reiterate that they are not views we hold , ' reads the statement			2
@entity73 : the @entity3 family made it clear they did not want to continue filming @entity4 without patriarch @entity3 the homophobic comments from the born - again @entity78 included such insights as , ' ' it seems like , to me , a vagina - as a man - would be more desirable than a man ’s anus			1
' that ’s just me			0
i ’m just thinking : there ’s more there ! she ’s got more to offer			0
i mean , come on , dudes ! you know what i ’m saying ? but hey , sin : it ’s not logical , my man			0
it ’s just not logical			0
' he also grouped homosexuals in with terrorists , saying , ' we never , ever judge someone on who ’s going to heaven , hell			0
that ’s the @entity104 ’s job			0
we just love ' em , give ' em the good news about @entity106 - whether they ’re homosexuals , drunks , terrorists			0
we let @entity110 sort ' em out later , you see what i ’m saying ? ' @entity115 hit back soon after the interview was released online , calling him a ‘ stain ’ on the network @entity5 which airs the show			1
@entity115 spokesperson @entity121 told @entity122 news : ' @entity3 and his family claim to be @entity78 , but @entity3 's lies about an entire community fly in the face of what true @entity78 believe			1
' he clearly knows nothing about gay people or the majority of @entity132 - and @entity133 - who support legal recognition for loving and committed gay and lesbian couples			2
disgusted : reverent @entity138 said @entity3 's comments make him worse than the bus driver who infamously sent @entity141 to the back of the bus ' @entity3 's decision to push vile and extreme stereotypes is a stain on @entity5 and his sponsors who now need to reexamine their ties to someone with such public disdain for @entity153 people and families			1
' in addition to his anti-gay rhetoric , the duck hunter also made dubious remarks regarding @entity159 before the @entity160			0
' i never , with my eyes , saw the mistreatment of any black person			0
where we lived was all farmers			0
the blacks worked for the farmers			0
i hoed cotton with them			0
i 'm with the blacks , because we 're white trash			0
we 're going across the field , ' said @entity3			2
' they 're singing and happy			0
i never heard one of them , one black person , say , ' i tell you what : these doggone white people ' — not a word ! ... pre-entitlement , pre-welfare , you say : were they happy ? they were godly ; they were happy ; no one was singing the blues			0
' for many , including reverend @entity138 , who compared @entity3 to the driver who sent @entity141 to the back of the bus the attempts at damage control by a $ @entity122 were insufficient			2
' these statements uttered by @entity3 are more offensive than the bus driver in @entity195 , @entity196 , more than 59 years ago , ’ @entity138 said in a statement obtained by @entity198			2
‘ at least the bus driver , who ordered @entity141 to surrender her seat to a white person , was following state law			0
' @entity3 ’s statements were uttered freely and openly without cover of the law , within a context of what he seemed to believe was “ white privilege			2
” ’ in his statement , the 72 - year - old civil rights leader demanded to meet within 72 hours with @entity5 executives and @entity213 ’s ceo to discuss the future of @entity4 memorabilia , which rakes in millions of dollars for the network and its star family			1
@entity138 also urged the network to uphold @entity3 ’s indefinite suspension from the popular program			1
stardom : two of the unlikely reality tv stars of @entity4 , brothers @entity223 ( left ) and @entity3 @entity3 's many fans and supporters countered with an online petition , called i stand with @entity3 , demanding @entity5 reinstate @entity3 to the show			1
' mr. @entity3 ’s comments in @entity9 are simply reflective of a @entity232 view of sexuality , marriage , and family – a view that has stood the test of time for thousands of years and continues to be held by the majority of @entity133 and today ’s world as a whole , ' reads the petition , launched by a conservative @entity78 organization			1
in addition to the petition , conservative @entity78 rallied behind @entity3 by flooding the @entity5 @entity246 offices with thousands of rubber duckies as part of the @entity250 campaign to reinstate the reality star to his show			1
another show of support came in the form of a planned mass eat - in at chicken restaurant @entity256 - a. ceo of the fast food restaurant @entity260 faced his own scandal after making anti-gay comments			1
according to @entity264 , supporters are planning a ' @entity265 ' day , in which they don camouflage gear and gorge on poultry			2
the odd show of support is planned for january 21 , according to a @entity34 page dedicated to the event			0
@entity3 supporters are encouraged to wear ' @entity275 or camouflage gear ' to their local @entity256 - a restaurant to ' stand for free speech ' and ' sit for good food			2
' fast food and freedom : the @entity34 page for a planned ' @entity282 ' in support of @entity3 it so far has more than 25,000 ' likes ' and many have expressed their desire to go			2
' @entity288 [ sic ] with @entity289 is right in what he said and how he believes			0
i will be eating ckicken [ sic ] to show support for free speech , ' wrote one			0
another questioned the sudden fervency of the @entity78 right 's support of free speech			1
' how many of you " free speech advocates " stood up for the @entity302 when people wanted to kick them off the radio for using their " free speech " ? ' it 's unclear what effect the mass consumption of fried chicken was intended to have on @entity3 's @entity312 controversy did no damage to the @entity3 coffers , either			1
sales for the @entity316 soared during the holiday season.according to @entity318 , duck the @entity319 : a @entity320 sold 132,000 during the week of december 22 , nearly twice the amount of discs sold since its first week on the shelves in @entity325 were high enough to claim the number four spot on the @entity329 album @entity328 definite end of the @entity275 's ' indefinite ' hiatus has been greeted without surprise by media @entity333 of business insider @entity335 tweeted , ' that @entity3 " suspension " was the most brilliant marketing stunt ever			1
two weeks ago , i had never even heard of @entity4 ! ' @entity341 host @entity340 tweeted , ' very excited @entity5 is resuming @entity4 with @entity3			1
we need more ignorant homophobic racists who probably hate women on the air			0
' the reality show - which follows the @entity3 clan running their duck - calling business in the swampland of @entity350 , @entity159 - has been a runaway success for @entity5 , with a @entity352 special recently pulling in 9 million viewers.the millionaire self - described hillbilly 's suspension made no impact on the upcoming season of the show and he has missed no filming time .			1
