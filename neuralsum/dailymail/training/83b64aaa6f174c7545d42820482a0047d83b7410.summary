when @entity1 and his family moved into their @entity4 home , they were constantly harassed by teenagers throwing toilet paper at their house			1
the torment got so bad , their 15 - year - old daughter decided to leave her school in the town of @entity14			1
so when some of the culprits were caught by the police , instead of pressing charges , they asked them to donate the rolls instead			2
since then they have received more than 1,000 , after the campaign spread on social media and the toilet paper throwing has stopped			1
as it went on however , they started to bang on the windows in the early hours of the morning and would wake up to find his garden furniture torn apart			0

' in early december , police officers caught some of the culprits during one of their ' papering ' sprees			0
mr @entity1 and his family decided that , instead of pressing charges , they should ask them to bring toilet paper to the house			1
