the winner was pictured on the podium being kissed on the cheek by ms @entity9 and another hostess			2
but the @entity48 cyclist drew attention to himself by reaching out and grabbing the bottom of the blonde woman			0
elaborate : this comic picture posted online clearly took a lot of logistical effort to set up parody : some @entity48 web users involved props such as cuddly toys to craft their supportive jokes backlash : they clearly though that mr @entity7 had done nothing wrong and was being unfairly criticised many commentators accused mr @entity7 of sexism - @entity64 , editor of cyclingnews.com , tweeted : ' in the workplace , it 's called harassment			1
