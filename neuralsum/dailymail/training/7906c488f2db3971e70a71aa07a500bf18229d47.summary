by @entity0 published : 20:18 est , 17 march 2014 updated : 20:34 est , 17 march 2014 leading world press freedom organisations condemned the government ’s @entity3 on press regulation yesterday as ‘ no form of solution at all ’			1
the charter was drawn up by politicians and approved by the @entity10 in the wake of the @entity12 into alleged wrongdoing by journalists			0
but in a highly critical report , the @entity15 ( @entity15 ) said excluding the newspaper industry from the final drafting process was ‘ a major error ’			1
it said any regulatory system must have the support of the industry and warned there was growing evidence that moves to heavily regulate @entity27 ’s newspapers are being used by repressive regimes to excuse their own press curbs			2
the @entity15 ( @entity15 ) said excluding the newspaper industry from the final drafting process of the @entity3 was ' a major error '			1
file picture the @entity3 underpins with statute a new body to oversee the regulation of the press , with publications that refuse to comply facing exemplary damages in libel cases			1
newspapers and magazines have refused to sign up , fearing it would bring an end to 300 years of press freedom			1
instead , the @entity37 is establishing a fully independent body to police its activities , the @entity47			0
it will be able to impose fines of up to £ 1million for serious and systemic wrongdoing			0
the @entity15 report , @entity51 in the @entity27 , follows a two - day fact - finding mission by international editors to the @entity27 in january			2
the 42 - page document said : ‘ the exclusion of the industry in the final drafting process of the @entity3 was a major error , if the intention was for a genuine improvement in the culture , ethics and professionalism of the @entity37			1
‘ a solution that did not include any of the media industry is entirely counterproductive , and can be described as no form of solution at all			1
there has been a real lack of public discussion about the implications of the issues raised by the @entity12 and their effects – positively or negatively – for freedom of expression in the @entity27			0
‘ the speed of implementation of the @entity3 proposal , coupled with the lack of legislative scrutiny , parliamentary vote or public consultation , has undoubtedly contributed to a general lack of understanding around the issues			2
the entire negotiation process in the build - up to a deal on a new system for regulation should have been more transparent			0
’ referring to ‘ @entity27 government interference ’ towards the @entity93 following its publication of @entity96 surveillance stories based on information from whistleblower @entity98 , it adds : ‘ political assurances that the @entity3 scheme provides a hands - off solution for press regulation and can guarantee press freedom are somewhat undermined by the readiness of the @entity27 government to intervene against the @entity93			1
’ @entity15 said : ' the royal charter system - used as an example or transposed elsewhere to countries lacking the @entity27 's historic commitment to human rights - risks an open invitation for abuse in other parts of the world ' @entity15 , which represents more than 18,000 publications , 15,000 online sites and 3,000 companies in more than 120 countries , warns that ‘ even the suggestion of a decline in @entity27 ’s regard for press freedom risks serious repercussions in other parts of the world ’			1
it said : ‘ the royal charter system – used as an example or transposed elsewhere to countries lacking the @entity27 ’s historic commitment to human rights – risks an open invitation for abuse in other parts of the world			0
‘ there is growing evidence , reported by the @entity15 membership , that the @entity27 approach – either in terms of regulation , or in the misuse of terrorism and national security legislation – is being used by repressive regimes to excuse their own practices towards the press			2
the @entity27 government ... should reiterate clearly to the international community that it continues to support a free and independent press , and back these statements with discernible action at home to support rather than punish journalism			0
’ its chief executive @entity153 said : ‘ given the @entity27 ’s continued influence over developing nations where media are essential for the spread of democratic values , the future of a free , independent press ... is under threat worldwide			0
’ @entity163 , executive director of the @entity164 , said the report was a ‘ sad and damning indictment of the political classes in a country that prides itself on being the mother of modern democracies ’			0
he added : ‘ no wonder journalists across the world are concerned that @entity27 , which lectures other countries about press freedom , has after 300 years taken a retrograde step in its own backyard			2
‘ we hope ministers will take note of the call to support a free and independent press internationally and back these statements with discernible action at home to support rather than punish journalism			0

press freedom organisation has called @entity3 ' no form of solution at all '
any regulation must have support of industry , claims @entity15 - @entity15
