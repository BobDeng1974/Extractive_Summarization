hopefuls : more than 1,000 jobseekers queued for just 40 jobs with budget supermarket chain @entity5 each candidate was given a mini-interview with management teams from branches of the supermarket before handing in their cv and contact details			1
a teenager , who did not want to be named and joined the winding queue at noon at the @entity28 store in @entity29 said : ‘ i knew it started at 1pm so i wanted to get here early , but i did n’t expect there to be that many people			1
‘ i walked right up to the store and then noticed the queue and my heart sank , i walked to the back and it just went on and on , i did n’t think it would ever stop			1
at least 1,500 candidates queued around the block for just 40 positions now available at @entity5 stores across the @entity13 ‘ before i got there i thought i would have a good chance of getting the job , but when i saw all those people i lost hope a bit			1
‘ the mini-interview went well , but it is hard to know if i will get the job as they have seen so many people			2
‘ it is hard for young people like myself to get a job , there just is n’t the opportunities out there and people do n’t want to give you a chance			2
‘ i went for this job because you have to take what you can get , like i said , the opportunities are limited			2
’ the applicants , who were hoping for stock and store assistant positions with a minimum of 20 hours a week are likely to find out if they have got the job within the next month			1
a mother - of - two , who queued since 10am added : ‘ i heard a rumour that there would be a lot of people here so i got here at 10am and was one of the first			0
‘ i had to wait three hours , but it was relief when i saw how many people really did turn up , i could n’t believe it			0
‘ it looked more like auditions for @entity83 , not a job for @entity5			1
‘ hopefully i got the job , but you never know , with over a thousand people there it is hard to judge , i do n’t know if being one of the first was an advantage or not			2
‘ i need this job to keep paying the bills and keep everything ticking over , including feeding my two children and getting them new school uniforms			0
' the scene follows the release of new figures last week showing a record number of people are now in work , as unemployment continues to fall			0
one hopeful said : ' it is hard for young people like myself to get a job , there just is n't the opportunities out there and people do n't want to give you a chance ' following the announcement of the figures , the prime minister tweeted : ‘ another significant fall in unemployment is a sign our long - term economic plan is working , providing security & chances for hard - working people			0
but it seems the situation in @entity28 has not changed since this time last year , when @entity5 had a similar response to their job vacancies			1
area manager for the supermarket , @entity128 said : ‘ a previous event similar to this attracted around 1,500 people so we knew this event would be well attended			0
’ the 40 positions available were split between @entity13 ’ stores in @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity140 , @entity141 , @entity142 and @entity143			0
there were also positions available in @entity146 and @entity147			0
