captain @entity5 has spent the past year clearing out all abandoned vessels from @entity8 harbour in @entity9 at a cost of thousands of pounds			1
he believes that would - be sailors are getting carried away after a few drinks and impulse buying second - hand fishing vessels through online auction site @entity16			2
captain @entity5 pictured , believes that too many amateur sailors are buying boats online using services like @entity16 without actually realising the additional costs associated with keeping a vessel seaworthy many boats , such as this one in @entity8 harbour in @entity9 are being left to rot by their owners @entity8 is an incredibly popular destination for boaters with a sheltered harbour and excellent mooring the hidden costs incurred with a boat such as mooring rates , maintenance and insurance , then scare the new owners who abandon their boats to rot in the harbour			1
in the past week the authorities have rounded up a catamaran , a fishing boat , a yacht and other miscellaneous vessels that had been abandoned and fallen into disrepair			2
when an abandoned vessel is identified a notice is issued to the owner , informing them they are required to either repair or remove the vessels			0
if this is not done , the authorities assess the vessel , before selling it off if it is still sea - worthy , or scrapping it if it is too damaged			0
captain @entity5 said : ' it 's one of the plagues of harbour masters			1
' people can be seduced into buying a boat really easily , often late at night and maybe after a few drinks , but buying it is the easy part - then there is mooring it , maintaining it and insuring it			1
' they do n't realise how expensive it is , ca n't afford it , and then we get left with the boats and the costs			0
' it is time - consuming , and we have better things to do			0
leaving a boat to rot is simply marine fly - tipping and we 're not having it			2
' people have a responsibility to the community , the environment and the harbour users			0
' @entity8 is a beautiful place and we want it to remain that way			0
