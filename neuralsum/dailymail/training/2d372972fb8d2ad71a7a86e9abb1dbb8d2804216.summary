' there were quite a few funny moments shooting this , ' @entity23 - based @entity19 tells @entity41 , ' and some wonderfully inspiring ones too			1
' ' when i went to photograph @entity15 , he 'd recently moved house and his dogs were n't sure about new people , ' she says			2

he says , ' we got @entity100 and @entity101 from a farm in @entity103			2

' this was severely tested this year when @entity97 , who had seemed to age overnight , was diagnosed with lung cancer and had a huge tumour removed surgically , ' he says			2
@entity113 with @entity114 , whom she calls ' the jam in our family bakewell ' ' they were apart for four days , the first time in their lives and @entity96 was mortified , though @entity97 rather enjoyed the five - star service at the @entity98 , ' he adds			1

' i have always had an affinity with dogs but it was n’t until i was nearly 30 years old that i got one of my own , ' he says			0
' he was a bulldog called @entity210 and when i picked him up as a puppy i could fit him into the palm of my hand			0
what i had n't bargained for was the bond that i formed with him and the place he had in my life and my heart			1
it was like a huge love affair			0
' he was the kindest and softest natured dog and i took him with me everywhere			0
