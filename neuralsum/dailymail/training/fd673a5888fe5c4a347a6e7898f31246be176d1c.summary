‘ if you want to pay money , that ’s what you want to see			0
’ who said that less than a year ago about @entity5 ? you guessed it right – @entity7			2
it was after a sensational performance i had witnessed from the @entity11 at @entity12 where he scored one and set up the winner in a 2 - 1 victory for @entity16			0
@entity5 was simply brilliant that day , he was a joy to watch			2
the criticism was that he did n’t do it consistently enough , yet the week before that virtuoso @entity21 performance @entity5 has curled in a brilliant winner against @entity24			0
i ’m well aware the fans on @entity34 love their no 9s , but they also love a flair player and @entity5 is a special talent			0
but he ’s a player who needs managing correctly , and i think it ’s a shame for @entity7 that he has seemingly waved the white flag with such a good player			1
having followed @entity7 ’s managerial career closely , i know he has sometimes expressed disappointment that he does n’t get the credit he feels he deserves			0
admitting defeat : @entity7 has waved the white flag with @entity5 i can understand where he is coming from			1
but managing a player like @entity5 and getting the best out of him would separate @entity7 from some of the rest , and give people a reason to look at him in a different light			1
but @entity7 has held his hands up and admitted defeat – he can not ‘ manage a maverick			0
’ @entity57 did it with @entity59 , sir @entity60 with @entity61 , but @entity7 has separated himself from the chance of getting anywhere near that kind of greatness by fundamentally refusing to work with @entity5			1
special talent : @entity5 proved to be a very special player at times for @entity16 it could be a special signing for @entity28			0
and @entity70 can draw on his experience with the man who he describes as the ‘ hurricane ’ , @entity61			1
@entity70 was the @entity11 ’s captain at @entity74 , the @entity28 boss was a leader in the dressing room the night of @entity61 ’s kung fu kick at @entity78 in 1995			2
given all his experience of @entity61 , if @entity70 ca n’t get the best out of @entity5 then the player will have to take a long hard look at himself			1
but if @entity70 gets @entity5 doing special things on the pitch , @entity7 will be left to face more criticism from the demanding @entity87 faithful			1
this time it will be totally justified			0
been there before : @entity70 was @entity61 's captain at @entity74 and got the best out of him			2

@entity7 has waved the white flag by selling @entity5
@entity5 can be a brilliant player on his day
@entity70 can use his experience of playing with @entity61 to manage him
