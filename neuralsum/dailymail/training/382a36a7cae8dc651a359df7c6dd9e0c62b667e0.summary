by @entity1 reporter published : 12:46 est , 27 april 2013 updated : 15:30 est , 27 april 2013 a group of 175 @entity3 have been withdrawn from a jointly run factory complex in @entity5 amid concerns of increasing tension between the two countries			1
the @entity3 workers could be seen arriving back at the border with their belongings from the factory park piled high on top of cars after they were recalled to @entity16			1
the emergency evacuation follows an earlier @entity5 rejection of a @entity3 demand for talks on the labour complex that has been closed nearly a month			1
both sides have warned of taking " grave measures " over the dispute but did not say what they might be			1
piled high : @entity3 vehicles were overloaded with finished products from @entity5 's @entity29 industrial complex get out ! : @entity3 workers returned back from @entity5 's @entity29 industrial complex with their possessions piled on the top of their cars piled high : some of the vehicles were dangerously overloaded with stacks of wood from the factory park in @entity5 quick escape : the @entity3 stuffed their vehicles with as much as they could take from their factories in @entity29 just on the other side of the @entity42 dividing the two @entity43			1
in a statement , the @entity3 minister in charge of inter-korean relations said he was worried about the workers not having access to food and medicine			1
@entity53 's powerful @entity52 earlier said @entity16 's demand for working - level talks was deceptive and that ongoing @entity57 - @entity3 military drills and the spreading of @entity59 leaflets at the border were proof of @entity16 's insincerity			1
the war of words calls into question the future of the complex in the @entity5 border town of @entity29			2
the jointly run factory park is the most significant casualty so far in the recent deterioration of relations between the @entity43			1
heavy load : @entity3 workers quickly unloaded the products made in @entity5 's after arrive from the @entity29 joint industrial complex in @entity5 tightly packed : @entity3 workers had to use every inch of their vehicles to fit in all their belongings low visibility : some cars were packed with so many items the driver could only see out of half the windscreen the @entity3 loaded the items across the top of cars a @entity3 driver and security personnel load a dropped sack onto a vehicle on its way back from @entity5 's @entity29 industrial complex we 're out : @entity94 workers looked relieved after their quick evacuation from the @entity29 joint industrial complex in @entity5 @entity5 also said today it will soon put a detained @entity57 on trial for allegedly trying to overthrow the government			1
the announcement further complicates the already fraught relations between @entity53 and @entity101			2
the indictment of @entity103 comes in the middle of something of a lull after weeks of threats by @entity5 against the @entity57 and @entity3			1
it has expressed rage over @entity111 sanctions over a february nuclear test and ongoing @entity57 - @entity3 military drills , though analysts say @entity53 's motive is to get its @entity117 enemies to negotiate on its own terms			2
@entity103 , identified in @entity5 state media by his @entity3 name , @entity121 , is a tour operator of @entity3 descent who was arrested after arriving with a tour on november 3 in @entity126 , a special economic zone bordering @entity128 and @entity129			2
he is the sixth @entity57 detained in @entity5 since 2009			0
the other @entity57 were eventually deported or released after high - profile diplomatic interventions , some involving former presidents @entity132 and @entity133			0
@entity5 says it will soon deliver a verdict in the case of detained @entity57 @entity103 analysts say the @entity137 will probably hand @entity103 a harsh punishment to use him as a bargaining chip in possible negotiations with the @entity57			0
" the preliminary inquiry into crimes committed by @entity57 citizen @entity145 closed , " the official @entity141 said in a brief report			0
" in the process of investigation he admitted that he committed crimes aimed to topple the @entity5 with hostility toward it			0
his crimes were proved by evidence			0
" @entity5 is the acronym for the @entity137 's official name , the @entity158 of @entity160 's criminal code , terrorist acts include murdering , kidnapping and injuring the country 's citizens can lead to a death sentence or life in jail			0
@entity5 and the @entity57 fought the 1950 - 53 @entity117 and still do not have diplomatic relations			0
the @entity169 in @entity53 represents the @entity57			0
dozens of @entity3 workers returned from the @entity29 joint industrial complex in @entity5 with their belongings piled on top of cars @entity141 did not say when @entity103 's trial will take place or what the charges were			1
@entity5 's state media and the @entity57 government have made little information about @entity103 public			0
but his friends , colleagues and @entity3 activists specialising in @entity5 affairs said he is a @entity188 missionary based in a @entity128 border town who frequently made trips to @entity5 to feed orphans there			2
officially , @entity5 guarantees freedom of religion			0
in practice , authorities crack down on @entity188 , who are seen as @entity197 - influenced threats to the government			0
the distribution of bibles and secret prayer services can mean banishment to a labour camp or execution , defectors from the country have said			2
in 2009 , @entity57 journalists @entity208 and @entity209 were arrested and sentenced to 12 years of hard labour for trespassing and unspecified hostile acts			2
they were freed later that year after mr @entity132 visited @entity53 to negotiate their release			0
