published : 11:29 est , 11 september 2012 updated : 12:48 est , 11 september 2012 they are among the most arresting images of an asteroid ever seen			2
@entity3 today released two new images taken from its @entity5 as it left the giant @entity7 asteroid			1
the first set of images is a color - coded relief map of @entity7 's northern hemisphere , from the pole to the equator			0
@entity3 's @entity5 has revealed the topography of the northern and southern hemispheres of the giant asteroid @entity7			1
@entity7 was discovered in 1807 , the fourth asteroid to be identified in the great belt of rocky debris orbiting between @entity19 and @entity20			2
at the time , its great scale meant it was designated as another planet but it later lost this status as researchers learnt more about the diversity of objects in the @entity27			2
it incorporates images taken just as @entity5 began to creep over the high northern latitudes , which were dark when @entity5 arrived in july 2011			1
the other image is a black - and - white mosaic that shows a full view of the giant asteroid , created by synthesizing some of @entity5 's best images			1
' @entity5 has peeled back the veil on some of the mysteries surrounding @entity7 , but we 're still working hard on more analysis , ' said @entity40 , @entity5 's principal investigator at @entity41			2
' so while @entity7 is now out of sight , it will not be out of mind			0
' the images mark the end of @entity5 's year - long encounter with the 330mile - wide asteroid @entity7 , making the mission the first to enter orbit around a main - belt asteroid			1
the main asteroid belt lies between the orbits of @entity19 and @entity20 , 117million miles from @entity53			0
the asteroid looks like a punctured football , the result of a colossal collision sometime in its past that knocked off its south polar region			0
@entity5 will now depart for its second destination , the dwarf planet @entity61			1
this will make it the first spacecraft to orbit two solar system destinations beyond @entity53			0
a composite image of @entity7 , showing the towering mountain at the south pole , more than twice the height of @entity71 , at the bottom of the image			0
the set of three craters known as the " snowman " can be seen at the top left .			0

spacecraft has ended year long mission to study the giant asteroid
@entity5 now head for dwarf planet @entity61
