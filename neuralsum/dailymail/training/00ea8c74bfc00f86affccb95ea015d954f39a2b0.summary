by @entity0 and @entity1 it 's the question fans have been asking since current @entity5 @entity4 announced he was quitting the @entity6 : is it time for a woman to take on the famous role ? certainly not , according to former doctor @entity10 , who insists the character should always be a man			1
@entity10 , who appeared in the @entity14 sci - fi drama between 1981 and 1984 , said : ‘ i ’ll probably get into trouble for saying this but i think it sort of has to be a man			1
man 's job : @entity10 appeared as the doctor , right , in the @entity14 sci - fi drama between 1981 and 1984 ‘ to have a female would be like having a female @entity24			1
it would be a rather odd thing			1
’ despite his comments , a number of actresses , including @entity30 star @entity29 , are being linked with the iconic role			2
since first appearing on our television screens in 1963 , @entity5 has been played by 11 men but never a woman			2
@entity10 , whose actress daughter @entity38 played a female @entity39 on the programme in 2008 , added : ‘ if you suddenly make the doctor a woman , you effectively say , “ well , let ’s give him a sex change ” and i do n’t think that works			1
‘ i ’m very happy for there to be a female @entity39			1
i think my daughter is one and she is shooting around the universe now			2
’ female contender : @entity52 with @entity10 's daughter @entity38 , right , in a 2008 episode of @entity5 some fans believed that @entity38 , 28 , who is married to former doctor @entity52 , could have been made a future doctor but her character has not been seen since			1
@entity10 ’s comments come as the show prepares to celebrate its 50th anniversary with a special edition starring both @entity4 , who announced in june that he was quitting the role after @entity64 , and @entity52			1
the actor , 62 , also claimed that powerful @entity14 figures were opposed to bringing the show back in 2005 after an absence of 17 years			2
his remarks will be seen as a swipe against @entity71 , who was @entity73 controller when @entity5 was taken off air in 1988 and who was back as @entity14 chairman when it returned			0
@entity10 said : ‘ it went off the air , not because the viewing figures dropped off , but because the powers that be at the time did n’t want it on air			1
they wanted to get rid of it , they did n’t like it			0
‘ i think nothing annoyed them more than when it came back as the most prestigious @entity14 programme at that time – it still is , in fact			0
especially as one particular person was there when it came back			0
’ surprise : @entity99 's trademark scarf became an unlikely hit on the show @entity102 @entity99 has revealed how his trademark scarf became an unlikely hit on the show			0
@entity99 , the longest - serving doctor , having played him from 1974 to 1981 , said : ‘ the producers looked at some kind of @entity109 artist and they decided that i should look like that			0
‘ we bought the wool and gave it to a woman called @entity114 and said , “ knit me a scarf with this sequence of colours			0
” ‘ a few weeks later we went to her house and we could n’t get in because of this bloody scarf			0
it was all over the place			0
' i laughed , but the designer said , “ let ’s keep it like that , ” so we did			0
