the view from the ninth tee at @entity2 suggests we 've stepped into a 19th @entity5 landscape painting			1
the @entity6 loom majestically in the distance , a thin mist hovers above the trees and a steam train puffs through the silver birches			0
all that 's missing is a stag			0
on cue , a young deer darts on to the fairway , in apparent appreciation of the shot that my brother has just plonked on the green			0
my own effort is considerably less impressive , but it 's hard to get downhearted while spending an afternoon knocking a little white ball around this heavenly corner of @entity26			1
beautifully refurbished : @entity27 dominates the picture - book village 20 minutes south of @entity29 the @entity30 is coming to @entity31 this month , but @entity26 golf is about more than the rolling grandeur of @entity34 or the splendour of @entity36			1
situated between @entity38 and @entity39 , @entity37 is barely an hour 's drive north from the spot where @entity42 will do battle with @entity44 , and it offers @entity26 in microcosm			1
there are mountains , sea and wide , dark rivers ; there is whisky , woodland and wildlife , including dolphins and ospreys			0
with good roads and a clement climate , @entity37 is ideal for a week - long family holiday or a boys ' weekend away			1
@entity60 : the @entity27 is famous for its selection of 700 whiskies @entity64 , woodland and wildlife : @entity37 offers @entity26 in microcosm and is ideal for a family holiday we opted for the latter , with the emphasis on golf			1
from the abundance of superb courses on offer , we played @entity76 - a gem of a course in the @entity79 - and @entity29 , but @entity80 , @entity81 and @entity82 are among several fine alternatives			1
after a swift pitstop in the clubhouse , we strike north for @entity86 over the stunningly isolated @entity87			0
our reward is the @entity89 on the edge of this neat little @entity5 town , deep in the heart of the @entity93			1
every few miles reveals one famous distillery or another and next morning we make a beeline for one of them , @entity98 - whose 10 year old @entity99 won gold at the 2014 @entity101			0
perhaps it 's the dram that does it , but our game picks up at @entity105 , a thoroughly satisfying parkland course			0
home base that night is the beautifully refurbished @entity27 , an imperious @entity109 landmark that dominates the picture - book village 20 minutes south of @entity29			1
famous distillery : @entity98 's @entity112 won gold at the 2014 @entity101 we head for the hotel 's legendary @entity60 , 120 years old and boasting one of the world 's largest selections of single malts - around 700			1
@entity37 is a cosmopolitan haven			1
alongside a healthy smattering of locals , the @entity27 harbours a lively mix of well - heeled @entity42 , @entity123 , @entity44 and @entity124			2
some are here to tackle the @entity127 , the famous 70 - mile route through the @entity129 to the sea			0
plenty more are taking a very personal interest in the whisky			0
but our quest concerns that little white ball			0
next morning we have one final date at @entity29 , and we rise to the occasion			0
in truth , neither of us is ever likely to trouble the @entity30 selectors , but if @entity37 has tested our limited golfing prowess , it has also provided an unforgettable few days of relaxation , hospitality and wonderful food and drink in simply stunning surroundings			2
