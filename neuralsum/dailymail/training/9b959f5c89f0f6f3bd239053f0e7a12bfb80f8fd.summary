by @entity0 published : 15:02 est , 3 december 2013 @entity2 : 21:03 est , 3 december 2013 as your eyes linger on the azure sky and sandy shore , a multitude of exotic locations easily spring to mind			1
and when shown this picture of a perfect beach , a quarter of adults were sure it was in @entity14			1
in fact , the photograph was taken much closer to home – on the @entity19 shores of @entity20			2
the beauty spot is just one of a host of @entity25 ’s best locations which we actually think are abroad , according to a survey			1
@entity29 paradise ? not quite , it 's @entity20 in @entity19 - but half of people in a survey thought it was @entity14 picturesque , but not @entity19 : @entity14 , @entity35 d ´ @entity36 , @entity37 as well as thinking @entity20 was on the @entity39 , respondents thought @entity41 ’s @entity40 was a landmark in @entity43 , and mistook parts of the @entity45 for both the @entity46 and the @entity47			1
more than half of the 2,000 adults thought a stretch of water in the @entity52 was actually @entity53 in @entity54			1
some of the 2,000 adults even mistook @entity56 ’s @entity55 was the @entity57 in @entity58			2
those surveyed were shown an image of the @entity45 ... ... but many thought it was the @entity47 in the @entity63 and while @entity20 may not quite have the glitz and glamour of @entity14 , it is becoming a resort where visitors and residents are prepared to pay a premium			1
last year five parking spaces in the small town sold for over £ 50,000 each			2
and earlier this year the @entity73 reported on a three - bedroom rental property which tripled in price in the @entity77 break from £ 889 a week to £ 2,899 , and then up to a staggering £ 4,499 in the peak weeks of july and @entity79 also has its unappealing aspects			0
this summer the @entity82 received three times as many calls complaining about seagulls which are known for dive bombing locals and visitors			0
a spokesman for @entity89 , which carried out the survey , said yesterday : ‘ we live in a fantastic country , but this research shows that many of us simply are n’t aware of the amazing places on our doorstep just waiting to be discovered			0
’ their research marked the train company ’s launch of a @entity102 app , @entity103 , which it is claimed offers ‘ real insight to the must - do experiences and must - see places of the @entity25 ’			0
the spokesman continued : ‘ we ’re passionate about all the @entity25 has to offer , so wanted to help @entity107 share in it too by giving them the @entity103			0
’ the app is meant to provide local information that normally only residents would be privy to , and includes a woodland walk in @entity112 recommended by musician @entity113 , to a tucked away @entity115 boutique frequented by the model @entity117 .			0

brits were shown beauty spots , but many thought they were exotic locales
@entity41 's @entity124 *mistaken* for a *building* in @entity43
some of those surveyed thought @entity45 were the @entity47
