it could have been the handset that took on @entity1 and @entity2			0
@entity3 and @entity5 ceo @entity4 discussed a potential investment by @entity7 in @entity9 's top smartphone maker ahead of its $ 1.1 billion fundraising last month , it has been revealed			1
the firm has been dubbed the ' @entity1 of @entity9 ' - and enraged @entity1 who believe the firm simply copies their work			1
@entity5 has enjoyed success with smartphones like the @entity17 and @entity18 after it was founded by @entity4 ( above ) four years ago although the company has drawn criticism for copying some of @entity1 's products @entity5 achieved success in just four years by producing a range of low priced mobile phone handsets that have attracted millions of customers			1
it is now worth more than @entity26 , the taxi app - which went on the market valued at more than $ 18.2 billion ( £ 11.7 billion )			2
investors now believe that @entity5 it has the potential to become a global consumer brand and as a result they have poured in cash in recent months			0
the @entity9 smartphone manufacturer recently became the most successful tech start - up in the world after being valued at $ 45 billion ( £ 29 billion )			1
however , a deal never materialized , several people with knowledge of the matter told @entity42			0
the discussions , at a private dinner when @entity3 visited @entity45 in october , were never formalized , three of those people said , as the two @entity47 weighed the political and commercial implications of @entity7 - which has been banned in @entity9 since 2009 - buying into the @entity9 tech star now valued at $ 45 billion			1
one individual with direct knowledge of @entity5 's fundraising said the mooted @entity7 investment was ' not huge , ' but the talks underscore how ties between @entity57 and @entity9 companies have deepened as @entity9 's tech industry matures			1
a @entity7 investment in @entity5 would have raised the international profile of the popular handset maker dubbed ' @entity9 's @entity1 ' by its fans and linked it to a @entity57 social networking phenomenon with more than 1.3 billion users			1
@entity7 , for its part , has long harbored ambitions to expand into the world 's most populous country , potentially with partners			2
one of the individuals said @entity7 and @entity5 began discussing a possible investment in mid- 2014			2
@entity5 's @entity4 was partly put off by the potential for political fallout at home of selling a stake to @entity7 while the @entity57 social network is still banned in @entity9 , two of the people said , adding @entity5 also feared a tie - up with @entity7 could threaten its relationship with @entity2 , a crucial business partner			1
@entity5 's phones are built on @entity2 's @entity86 operating system			0
@entity3 has eyed @entity9 as a critical piece of his vision to connect the global population			0
@entity5 ultimately announced last month it raised $ 1.1 billion from investors including @entity93 - based tech fund @entity94 ; @entity95 , a private equity firm that has invested in @entity7 and @entity96 ; @entity97 sovereign wealth fund @entity98 ; @entity9 fund @entity100 ; and @entity96 founder @entity102 's @entity101			1
the fundraising valued @entity45 - based @entity5 at $ 45 billion just three years after it sold its first smartphone			1
the company had revenue of close to $ 12 billion in 2014			0
similarities in the design of @entity5 's products and those of @entity1 have earned the company the unofficial title as ' the @entity1 of @entity9 '			1
it even produces a @entity113 similar to @entity114 and its own version of @entity1 's @entity116 called @entity117			2
executives at @entity1 , which is valued at around $ 651.5 billion ( £ 418.6 billion ) , have reacted badly to these , with its vice president of design @entity119 effectively accusing @entity5 of theft			1
@entity1 's head of design hit out @entity5 at the recent @entity124 in @entity125			1
asked what he felt about the company being described as the ' @entity1 of @entity9 ' , sir @entity126 criticised them for copying his company 's designs			1
' i do n't see it as flattery , ' he said , ' i actually see it as theft			0
' sir @entity126 said seeing knockoff designs made him think of the lengthy development cycle that went into producing the originals			0
he said : ' when you 're doing something for the first time , for example with the phone , and you do n't know it 's going to work , and you spend seven or eight years working on something , and then it 's copied — i have to be honest , the first thing i think is n't ' ooh , that was flattering '			0
' all those weekends i could have had at home with my lovely family but did n't , but the flattery made up for it			0
' however , @entity5 's global vice president @entity154 said such accusations were ' sensationalist '			0
he told the @entity156 : ' if you have two similarly skilled designers , it makes sense that they would reach the same conclusion			0
' @entity3 has eyed @entity9 as a critical piece of his vision to connect the global population			0
but , like @entity2 and @entity165 , the social networking giant has been blocked by @entity9 's internet censors , who cite national security concerns			0
' @entity7 wants to get into @entity9 , and @entity5 is keen to expand outside , so they both recognize the importance of working together , ' said one of the knowledgeable individuals , none of whom wanted to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter			1
@entity5 and @entity7 declined to comment for this article			2
the two @entity47 knew each other previously and deepened their relationship last year			0
in october , @entity3 was invited for dinner at @entity4 's @entity45 home along with @entity183 development chief @entity182 and @entity9 head @entity184			2
the next day , @entity3 , whose wife is @entity186 , addressed the prestigious @entity187 and won plaudits for speaking in @entity189 during a 30 - minute q&a session			0
the @entity192 6 handset , which many have said is simply a copy of the @entity195 and uses its own apps , has helped turn @entity5 into the third biggest smartphone producer in the world behind @entity1 and @entity199 as @entity5 sought financing last year , @entity201 , a @entity125 - based fund that manages several individuals ' personal wealth , including @entity3 's , also considered buying shares , but ultimately did not , several people with knowledge of the matter said			1
talks about @entity201 taking part in @entity5 's financing were not led by @entity3 himself			0
@entity5 is @entity9 's biggest smartphone maker , according to some industry analysts , and trails only @entity199 and @entity1 in global market share			1
a strategic partnership with @entity5 would give @entity7 another avenue to distribute its apps and potentially provide a powerful ally in its bid to overturn its @entity9 ban			2
@entity221 phones have been the company 's best selling products in @entity9 , @entity97 , @entity224 and @entity225 for @entity5 , access to @entity7 's vast banks of user data would be valuable as it seeks to grow into a global internet company providing comprehensive online services			1
but @entity4 thought it would be ' too sensitive ' to sell an equity stake to @entity7 given its uncertain political status in @entity9 , said one of the people with knowledge of the matter			2
@entity9 's top internet censor , @entity239 , has warned that social media , particularly foreign services , could be a destabilizing force for @entity9 society			0
@entity239 , however , visited @entity7 's @entity57 headquarters last month , prompting speculation that relations between @entity7 and @entity9 's government were warming .			2

@entity5 was founded just four years ago by @entity9 businessman @entity4
most successful tech start - up in the world after being valued at $ 45 billion
the firm has been accused of copying @entity1 's designs with its products
@entity7 failed to reach agreement over investment
