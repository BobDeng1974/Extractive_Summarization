brave : @entity6 managed her first dance at her wedding despite being struck down with a paralysing spinal injury which doctors told her was incurable shock : miss @entity6 , 24 , had been with her partner @entity7 , 28 , for just three months when she woke one morning completely unable to use her legs in mrs @entity6 ’s case , the cysts were growing perilously close to her brain stem , ruling out the possibility of surgery to remove them			1
mrs @entity6 , a former mental health nurse of @entity25 , @entity26 , said : ' i worried about what the diagnosis meant for me and @entity7			1
' we had n’t been together for that long and i thought , " he has n’t signed up for this "			2
' i actually told him to leave me , even though i loved him			2
but he was having none of it			2
' mrs @entity6 met @entity7 , a carpenter , through online dating in 2011 and says it was love at first sight			1
she said : ' internet dating brought me the man of my dreams			0
i moved away from @entity42 in @entity26 to @entity43 in @entity44 where he lived to start a new life together			0
it was a bit of a whirlwind			0
' condition : doctors diagnosed mrs @entity6 with incurable syringomyelia - a condition which involves cysts growing on the spinal cord but then in april 2011 , just two weeks after she relocated , she started to experience unsettling weakness in her lower body			1
she said : ' i collapsed at home			2
it was completely unexpected - it was as if my leg could n’t hold me up anymore			0
i thought i was just tired , and hoped a night in bed would sort me out			0
' but when she woke the next morning , she could n’t feel anything below her hips at all			0
an ambulance rushed her to @entity65 in @entity66 where doctors diagnosed syringomyelia			1
@entity69 sees a tube - shape cavity form and fill with liquid in the spinal cord			1
complications can be far reaching , including problems with pain , numbness , weakness , stiffness , control of bladder or bowel function , and paralysis			2
problem : in mrs @entity6 's case , the cysts were growing perilously close to her brain stem , ruling out the possibility of surgery to remove them @entity69 is a disorder in which a cyst forms within the spinal cord			1
this cyst , called a syrinx , expands and elongates over time , destroying a portion of the spinal cord from its centre and expanding outward			1
as a syrinx widens , it compresses and injures nerve fibres that carry information from the brain to the extremities			2
damage to the spinal cord often leads to progressive weakness in the arms and legs , stiffness in the back , shoulders , arms , or legs , and chronic , severe pain			1
other symptoms may include headaches , a loss of the ability to feel extremes of hot or cold ( especially in the hands ) , and loss of bladder and other functions			0
source : @entity126 cavities can get larger over time , exerting increased pressure , making symptoms worse			0
however the damage can be halted and sometimes repaired with surgery			2
but surgery was judged far too risky in mrs @entity6 ’s case because the cyst was so close to her brain - stem			1
she said : ' the doctors said although i could have physiotherapy to help me move again , i had a long road ahead , and if the cysts got any bigger , my paralysis could be permanent			2
' i thought it was n’t fair on @entity7 to expect him to be my carer			0
we ’d had loads of plans and it seemed we ’d have to give them all up			0
' i told him to find someone else who he could live he dreams with and i promised i would understand			0
' when he came back to the hospital the next day , i knew he was devoted			2
' over the following months mrs @entity6 learned to use an electric wheelchair and was able to train herself to walk short distances on crutches			1
in september 2013 , the couple married			0
mrs @entity6 defied the expectations of doctors by managing to walk down the aisle , holding onto the arm of her grandfather , @entity161 , and enjoy her first dance			1
@entity163 : mrs @entity6 defied the expectations of doctors by managing to walk down the aisle and enjoy her first dance she said : ' @entity7 and i danced to @entity167 and @entity169 ’s song " it ’s @entity170 "			1
for one day i could forget about all our troubles			0
' i wanted to do something special for @entity7			0
i built up my strength beforehand to make sure i had the energy to do it			0
' despite all our challenges , i feel lucky			0
if i ’m ever having a down day i can remember our wedding day , and know that i ’ll have @entity7 with me , no matter what			0
