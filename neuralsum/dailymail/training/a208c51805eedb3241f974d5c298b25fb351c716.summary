more than 50 @entity1 charities are being covertly observed over fears they may be linked to extremism and radicalisation			1
in the last two years , charity regulator the @entity5 has marked 55 charities with an issue code called ' extremism and radicalisation ' , without the knowledge of the organisations concerned			1
and of the 44 ongoing investigations launched by the regulator since january 2013 , 17 concern @entity1 - linked charities			1
more than 50 @entity1 charities are being observed over fears they may be linked to extremism , while five organisations working in @entity19 , including @entity20 which @entity23 hostage @entity21 was working with when he was kidnapped , are the focus of ongoing statutory inquiries by the @entity5 five @entity23 charities working in @entity19 , including @entity20 which @entity23 hostage @entity21 was working with when he was kidnapped last december , are also the focus of ongoing statutory inquiries			1
the figures were revealed in a request under the @entity30 by think tank @entity31 , which works to promote social cohesion for @entity23 muslims			1
it says the new issue code was introduced in december 2012 , three months after sir @entity36 was appointed as chairman of the @entity5 that september			1
the following year , sir @entity36 brought in a new board , including former @entity41 counter terrorism chief @entity40 , and he has described the cause of @entity44 extremism as the ' most deadly ' faced by the charity sector			0
' @entity47 has labelled 55 charities with the issue code " extremism and radicalisation " without their knowledge , ' writes @entity31 's @entity52 in his report , ' @entity46 : a @entity54 '			1
cracking down : the issue code was introduced in december 2012 , three months after sir @entity36 ( left ) was appointed as chairman of the @entity5 , while former @entity41 counter terrorism chief @entity40 ( right ) sits on the watchdog 's board ' this means the @entity5 has flagged up 55 charities which will be monitored as a potential concern for matters relating to extremism and radicalisation in the period december 5th 2012 to may 8th 2014			1
' the criteria for applying and removing this issue code is not in a written form which can be scrutinised			2
we were informed that “ an issue code is applied solely on the basis of the subject and type of allegations or concerns that have come to the attention of the @entity5 "			1
' in his report , mr @entity74 said @entity1 charities had been ' disproportionately affected ' by investigations , and that some of the charities being monitored by the @entity5 had been subjected to questioning over tenuous links to extremist clerics			1
pledge : last month @entity82 said the @entity5 would receive an extra £ 8million and tougher powers quoting a trustee of an unnamed charity , the report states : ' we were questioned at length about different religious clerics who in most cases had done nothing more than deliver one lecture at a fundraising event some time in the past for us			2
we were quoted snippets from lectures they had given at events that were nothing to do with us and asked to provide explanations			0
' another had told the report authors : ' it felt like the assumption was we were apologists for extremists unless we could justify why we were n’t			0
if the @entity5 felt that unlawful speech had been used they should have gone to the @entity41 with their quotes			2
' last month , prime minister @entity82 pledged that the @entity5 would receive an extra £ 8million and tougher powers to put the squeeze on bogus good causes which divert cash to terrorism and other criminal activity			0
an automatic ban on anyone with convictions for certain criminal offences becoming a trustee of a charity is one of the changes included in a draft protection of @entity124 - as well as the power for the @entity5 to disqualify anyone they consider unfit			0
it will also be allowed to shut down charities under investigation to protect public confidence , to issue an official warning in less serious cases and to prevent people resigning to avoid disqualification before returning in another guise			0
that same month , sir @entity36 said there was a ' risk ' that money donated by members of the public had been sent to fighters with the so - called @entity143 , and said the watchdog was scrutinising 86 charities at risk from extremism , including 37 working with @entity19 victims			0
but mr @entity74 said : ' thus far there has been no empirical evidence to substantiate concerns that @entity1 charities are surreptitiously operating with the purpose of supporting terrorist or extremist activities			2
' a @entity5 spokesman told @entity156 : ' @entity47 does not target @entity1 , any other religion or type of charity			2
all our casework is prioritised and assessed for action against the @entity162 , published on the website			0
we are keen to remove the perception that this is not the case			0
' a full analysis of the @entity5 's compliance work including investigative and monitoring work for the last financial year will be in this year 's publication @entity171			0
