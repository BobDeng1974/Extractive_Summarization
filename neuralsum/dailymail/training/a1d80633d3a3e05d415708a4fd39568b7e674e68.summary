elegantly decorated and lit with twinkling chandeliers , these sumptuous interiors would n't look out of place in the most exclusive of @entity4 homes			1
but this townhouse , from scullery to top - floor boudoir , stands at just over 4ft tall - and every step , door and window has been built in miniature			2
modelled on a @entity15 property from 1815 , this very grown - up dolls ' house is the handiwork of @entity17 and @entity18 , who charge customers upwards of £ 4,000 for one of their miniature masterpieces			1
welcoming : the dining room opens out onto the entrance hall through double doors			0
a separete servants ' door can be seen in the corner lavish : guests would be led into the home through the entrance hall , above , before being taken to the reception rooms upstairs intimate : an elegant crystal chandelier hangs from the ceiling of the second - floor drawing room , pictured , which is stocked with books miniature masterpiece : the exterior of the @entity41 house ( pictured ) features railings that separate the townhouse from the pavement the couple , from @entity46 , spend weeks carefully constructing , painting and finishing each home that they make			1
and their attention to detail is paying off - the waiting list for one of their made - to - order creations is more than a year			1
mr @entity57 , a former software developer , quit his job in 2008 to focus full - time on his passion for dolls houses			2
his wife , @entity61 , left her position as a librarian earlier this year to begin working for their company , @entity64 , full - time			0
mr @entity57 focuses on building the main form of the dolls house - measuring and carving the birch plywood to each customer 's specification - while his wife specialises in painting , decorating and marbling the homes			1
the @entity75 have a series of standard designs that they then adapt to suit each individual client - offering bedrooms , attics and wine cellars as optional extras			2
for the paint , the couple use @entity86 and @entity88 colours as they are ' consistent ' and easy to find - wherever in the world the house ends up			1
mrs @entity18 said that , while her husband has had no formal training , his work makes the most of his ' extreme eye for detail '			2
detailed : the four - storey home , pictured , has been built so that each room can be accessed through a logical series of doors and corridors this attention to every finishing touch and final flourish is what sets their work apart from others who construct these miniature homes , she added			1
mrs @entity18 told @entity112 : ' he always tries to get over the feeling of it being a real house			1
with them you have always got room behind rooms			0
‘ you can see how it all works together			0
that is one of the things that @entity17 always does , he gets the rooms behind the rooms			2
’ in the @entity41 house , for example , the @entity75 needed to consider the need for domestic staff , because that is what homeowners of the time would have been thinking about			0
it means that running behind each of the elegant reception rooms is a servants ' corridor - accessed through concealed ' jib ' doors - that all lead down to the scullery and kitchen			0
retreat : the study has been finished by @entity57 with thoughtful flourishes , such as the hourglass placed on the fireplace hidden from view : the scullery ( pictured left ) can be accessed by servants without walking through the main rooms of the house finishing touches : flickering light fixtures on the back wall bring warmth into the basement kitchen of the @entity156 , pictured authentic : a panelled library , like the one pictured above , can be added to any dolls house as a collectors upgrade for an extra cost @entity161 : for the @entity41 model , pictured above , the @entity162 added a side portico ( seen on the right ) which sits above a wine cellar looking at the designs , it is clear that @entity169 and mrs @entity18 carefully considered how a visitor to the home would move through the space			1
each room is accessed through a logical series of doors and corridors - and each staircase has been placed in a realistic position			0
even the flickering fireplaces - included as part of the standard package - align with chimney breasts and chimney stacks			1
another subtle touch that adds to the ' realness ' of the pieces is the proportions of the rooms			0
it means , as mrs @entity18 explains , that any miniature furniture that their customers buy fit in the space without throwing out the sense of scale - which is 1/12			1
the grandness of their rooms can be viewed by pulling the house open from the front or the side panels			0
mrs @entity18 said : ‘ you get these magical views			2
it is not just a set of pigeon holes like some dolls houses can be			0
that is very much @entity17 ’s thing			0
that is not common at all			0
but despite the accuracy , mrs @entity18 said that they are designed to be ' played with ' and not to be used as ' architectural models '			1
though she admits that those enjoying their works are usually adult collectors - not children			0
' ready to move in ' : staff call bells , attached to bell pulls in various rooms of the house , hang on one of the walls in the basement perspective : these views along the corridors reveal how the drawing room ( left ) and dining room ( right ) are seen from different angles depth : this view shows what the ground floor of the house looks like through the double @entity236 doors on the side portico , an added extra			2

@entity17 and @entity18 , from @entity46 , spend weeks carving , painting and marbling each made - to - order dolls house
their miniature masterpieces - which cost upwards of £ 4,000 - are designed as homes that are ' ready to move in '
flickering fireplaces , @entity248 paint and grand chandeliers are all included as standard features
