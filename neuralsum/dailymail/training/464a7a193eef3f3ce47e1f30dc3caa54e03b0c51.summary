@entity0 are seriously considering a january move for @entity2			1
however , they could face competition from @entity5 , the club where the @entity6 started his career			2
@entity2 is currently on a two - year loan from @entity9 to @entity10 , but it has been widely reported in @entity12 that the @entity14 side want to end the deal due to the striker ’s lack of form and goals			1
he has scored just once in 10 games			1
but that would seem unlikely			2
@entity0 , who seem to be giving up on the gamble that saw them sign @entity25 for £ 16million from @entity10 last summer , need to bolster their strike force			1
and @entity2 , who was outstanding for the @entity28 ( 65 goals in 102 @entity27 games ) before being sold to @entity9 for £ 50million in 2010 could fit the bill			1
@entity0 may take the 30 - year - old on loan with a view to a permanent move			1
meanwhile , @entity25 could be moved on loan to @entity48 in janaury			2
@entity49 is looking to improve his strike force in january due to @entity52 's injury problems @entity0 could face competition for @entity2 from another of his former clubs , @entity56 side @entity5 @entity58 boss @entity57 has made it clear he wants to bolster his strike force			1
@entity62 ’s @entity61 is a possibility and so is @entity65 poacher @entity64			1
@entity58 hope to sign a striker in january and @entity61 ( left ) and @entity64 ( right ) are options @entity69 boss @entity68 believes striker @entity70 will sign a new £ 60,000 - a - week contract ahead of the transfer window			1
@entity73 have been considering a move for the in - form striker			1
@entity69 hope in - form marksman @entity70 will stay at the club but @entity73 are considering a swoop @entity79 also wants £ 60,000 a week to commit his future to @entity62			1
the defender is out of contract in the summer			0
last week @entity62 boss @entity83 said it would take an offer of £ 20m to prise @entity79 away in january			1
that ’s a rather optimistic evaluation			0
@entity0 and @entity87 remain interested			1
so far the @entity62 board have offered @entity79 a new deal in the region of £ 45,000 a week			1
but if they raise it by around £ 15,000 the @entity92 international is likely to sign			2
@entity79 wants a £ 60,000 - a - week deal at @entity62 with @entity87 and @entity0 interested in the defender @entity97 final official @entity96 , now technical advisor to the @entity27 referees , has been in @entity100 to assess a trial of using in - game tv replays			1
@entity105 and @entity106 player @entity104 has become an ambassador for @entity108 , the new sports drink company who sponsor @entity110 and now supply many @entity112 clubs			0
their ' health drink rivals ' include @entity115 , @entity116 and @entity117			0
i am hearing @entity62 will still not be rushed into talks with @entity83 over a new contract			1
in turn , @entity83 , whose contract expires in the summer , has not been banging on the chairman ’s door			1
even if the club finish the season in the form they have shown so far there could still be a parting of ways in the summer			1
@entity83 may leave at @entity62 at the end of the season despite their fine form so far i am also hearing as it stands @entity136 will work out his notice with @entity138 over the next 12 months			1
but if the situation becomes impossible and there is parting of ways former @entity105 , @entity143 and @entity138 legend @entity142 could be in line for the @entity138 hot seat			0
@entity142 could be in line for the @entity138 job if @entity136 's situation becomes impossible last season @entity0 crushed @entity87 5 - 1			1
ca n’t see that happening again			0
and should @entity87 win ( 6 - 4 with @entity150 ) the pressure on @entity0 boss @entity49 really will intensify			1
as it stands @entity49 is the third most likely @entity27 boss to be axed at 5 - 1 behind @entity155 ’s @entity154 ( 11 - 10 ) and @entity157 ’s @entity156 ( 11 - 4 )			2
btw @entity158 was 20 last week			2
ahead of sunday ’s game against @entity87 he has made 75 appearances for @entity0 and scored 14 goals since his debut in 2012			1
he has made 13 appearances for @entity105 but has n’t scored			2
he has played at @entity97 finals			0
he is an exciting talent			0
he could even become a world - class player			0
but in the grand scheme of things his top - level career is still in its infancy			0
nevertheless , @entity0 are keen to secure his services have offered him another new deal worth £ 70,000 a week			1
it seems right on the money in terms of the @entity27 wage band due to @entity158 ’s age , experience and achievement			0
@entity158 is a superb talent and has already played 75 times for @entity0 @entity158 has potential but has a long way to go before hitting the level of @entity184 and @entity185 but @entity158 , or perhaps more to the point his advisers , have thus far turned it down			1
it is understood the @entity191 camp want more than £ 100,000			2
and suddenly there are stories leaking out that @entity194 or @entity195 want him			0
it has become a poker game			0
i understand players wanting to get the best deal they can			0
but before you can expect to pick up the wages of ‘ platinum players ’ , prove you really are one over a period of time			0
at this stage of his career @entity158 ’s focus should on making the step up to the next level , where he would be doing it week in week out like the @entity184 ’s or @entity185 ’s of this world , not haggling over more money			2
@entity158 's camp should not be haggling over more money at @entity0 with him at such a young age i say it ’s boring and often embarrassing when managers use most of their ‘ air time ’ at post-match tv interviews to complain about referees			2
usually it ’s a device after a defeat to offer sufficient soundbites to divert attention from the other reasons why the team lost			0
it ’s easy to ridicule referees who do n’t have a right of reply			0
and once the manager has set the agenda , the fans and often naive headline writers do the rest			0
sometimes when managers go a bit too far in the criticism they get fined			0
you get the impression , though , that managers think the fine is worth paying if it deflects criticism from them			2
refereeing decisions have been criticised this season but the stats prove they 're at the top of their game of course referees and linesman make mistakes			2
and yes there are times when a bad big call on a foul , offside or a red card changes the course of a game			0
but it ’s all too easy to slaughter officials after the countless replays			0
and consider this statistic : ahead of this saturday ’s @entity27 fixtures there had been , collectively , 38,718 decision moments for referees			0
of those , according to the analysis of match evaluators , 98.4 per cent have been made correctly			0
it ’s often said that all managers and players want from referees is consistency			0
well according to those figures that ’s exactly what they are getting .			0

@entity2 has scored just once in 10 games for @entity10
@entity0 could look to bring him back to @entity23 in january
striker is on loan from @entity9 who should not need him back
@entity73 interested in signing @entity69 striker @entity70
@entity79 is hoping for £ 60,000 a week to remain at @entity62
@entity83 may leave club at end of season despite fine form
