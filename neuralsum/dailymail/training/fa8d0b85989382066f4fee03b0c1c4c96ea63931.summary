a @entity1 donor has angered his neighbours with plans for a two - storey basement under his £ 20m house in @entity6			1
@entity7 , who with his father @entity8 has given more than £ 1million to the political party , was given the green light for his extensive plans last week			1
they include a huge subterranean leisure complex with its own cinema and pool , as well as steam , sauna and treatment rooms - all accessed by a lift			1
@entity7 , pictured with wife @entity20 , has angered his neighbours with plans for a two - storey basement under his £ 20m house in @entity6 a conservatory at the rear will also be demolished and replaced with a dining room , family room and roof terrace overlooking the mews home , which houses two employees and a gym			1
the decision comes just a year after he was arrested by the serious @entity35 in relation to an inquiry into @entity39 's overseas business practices			0
both mr @entity7 and his father deny any wrongdoing			1
but neighbours next to the @entity44 listed property are less than pleased about the ' grotesque ' plans			1
while one resident said he feared a nightmare of lorries charging up and down the street as they carried out the work			0
the planned subterranean extension to @entity7 's @entity6 home includes a large pool and cinema a spokesman for the @entity57 said : ' planning permission has been granted and that 's that			1
as far as the @entity60 investigation goes they have not been interviewed or talked to again			0
' the soaring popularity of underground extensions by wealthy home owners has to led claims that diggers are being left entombed across @entity67 - because they are cheaper to bury than lift to street level			1
the @entity71 's @entity70 claimed that up to 1,000 jcbs - worth around £ 5 milion - had been buried under some of the capital 's most expensive houses			2
but others have laughed off the claims as ' utterly ludicrous			0
' @entity78 , managing director of @entity79 , said that no professional would leave a digger under any circumstances and there was always an exit strategy for the equipment			0
basement extensions several storeys below the ground have become increasingly popular in some of the capital 's most expensive neighbourhoods as home - owners attempt to increase their living space without infringing strict planning controls			2
they have led to the creation of what are known as ' iceberg homes ' , with the extra space earmarked to accommodate private cinemas , spas and swimming pools			0
applications for basement developments in @entity105 and @entity105 alone , had soared in numbers - from 46 in 2001 to 450 in 2013 - and size , with two and three - storey basements ' not uncommon '			1
the likes of @entity110 , @entity111 and @entity112 , heir to the @entity114 fortune , have all been said to have sought permission for basement extensions in the capital			0
but not everyone is a fan with attress @entity119 expressing outrage last year at her new neighbours in upmarket @entity6 - many of whom she said hardly even use their homes			1
@entity125 on @entity126 have complained about the ' grotesque ' plans with fears they will create noise , dust and construction traffic the dynasty actress , 80 , told a residents ' magazine : ' it 's really sad			2
i find it shocking that people are digging down to put in swimming pools and bowling alleys when they only live here for two or three months of the year			0
' @entity143 guitarist @entity142 also took umbrage at building work near his @entity105 home			2
writing online last month he said : ' @entity105 used to be a nice quiet decent place to live ... now it 's becoming a hellhole '			0
mr @entity7 , a ceo at care home company @entity149 , lives with his wife @entity20 , an interior designer , and their young son			1
in 2011 mrs @entity154 posed as a penniless pregnant woman to appear on @entity157 's @entity156 , in which she donated £ 100,000 to a centre for vulnerable people in @entity160			2
the @entity67 borough is to become the first local authority in the country to introduce restrictions on controversial subterranean developments			2
last december , a government planning inspector gave @entity105 and @entity105 council the green light to its proposals to curb the scale of subterranean development			1
basement extensions will still be permitted but the new rules restrict how far they can stretch under a garden , limit them to a single storey in most cases and ban developments under listed buildings altogether			0
council cabinet member for planning policy @entity181 had called basements ' the single greatest planning concern ' in living memory			0
he said many had complained after they had experienced years of misery from noise , vibration , dust and construction traffic			0
the new guidelines are set to be formally adopted this year .			0
