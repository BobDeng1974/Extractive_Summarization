by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 20:37 est , 14 january 2014 updated : 02:48 est , 15 january 2014 a federal judge on tuesday struck down @entity6 's gay marriage ban , saying it violates the @entity8 , but immediately stayed the effects of the ruling while the courts sort out the matter			1
in his ruling , @entity14 district judge @entity13 criticized a law that was approved by voters in 2004 in this conservative state known as the buckle of the @entity20			1
he described the gay marriage ban as ' an arbitrary , irrational exclusion of just one class of @entity6 citizens from a governmental benefit			1
' the @entity6 ruling comes about a month after a federal judge in @entity28 overturned that state 's ban on same - sex marriage			1
hundreds of couples got married there before the @entity14 @entity34 intervened , putting a halt to the weddings until the courts sort out the matter			0
@entity13 cited that case in issuing the stay of his own ruling			2
victory : @entity43 and @entity44 had filed the @entity6 lawsuit along with another same - sex couple in november 2004 the constitutional amendment approved by @entity6 voters says marriage in the state consists only of the union of one man and one woman			1
@entity54 said the measure violates the @entity14 @entity8 's equal protection clause by precluding same - sex couples from receiving an @entity6 marriage license			1
' equal protection is at the very heart of our legal system and central to our consent to be governed			0
it is not a scarce commodity to be meted out begrudgingly or in short portions			0
therefore , the majority view in @entity6 must give way to individual constitutional rights , ' @entity13 wrote			2
@entity6 attorney general @entity71 's office , which has supported the law , did not immediately have a comment on the ruling			2
not including @entity28 and @entity6 , 27 states still have constitutional prohibitions on same - sex marriage			0
four more states — @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 and @entity82 — do not permit it through state laws			0
unconstitutional : judge @entity85 struck down @entity6 's gay marriage ban , saying it violates the @entity8 for 17 days , @entity28 was the 18th state to allow gay couples to wed. but the @entity34 put a halt to them earlier this month by granting the state a stay on a federal judge 's ruling that two other courts previously denied			1
the fate of gay marriage in @entity28 now rests in the hands of a federal appeals court in @entity98			2
@entity99 couple @entity43 and @entity44 had filed the @entity6 lawsuit along with another same - sex couple in november 2004 , shortly after @entity6 voters overwhelmingly passed the constitutional amendment			1
the couples were seeking the right to marry and to have a marriage from another jurisdiction recognized in @entity6			0
the judge waited nine years before issuing his ruling , a striking contrast to the spate of lawsuits filed across the country following last summer 's @entity34 ruling that required the federal government to recognize legal same - sex marriages			0
supporters : @entity6 attorney general @entity71 supports the 2004 law , which defines marriage as being between a man and a woman ' the @entity122 couple has been in a loving , committed relationships for many years , ' @entity13 wrote			1
' they own property together , wish to retire together , wish to make medical decisions for one another , and wish to be recognized as a married couple with all its attendant rights and responsibilities			0
' in 2006 , the @entity99 couples ' case made its way to the 10th @entity14 @entity134 after the district court denied the governor of @entity6 and the state attorney general 's motion to dismiss the case			0
the appeals court ruled in 2009 that the couple lacked standing , so the two couples filed an amended complaint removing the governor and attorney general and adding the @entity146 , since that is the person who issues marriage licenses .			0

@entity6 voters passed a law banning gay marriage in 2004
judge @entity13 on monday found that the law violates the @entity8
in his ruling , @entity13 *blasts* the law as an arbitrary , irrational exclusion of just one class of @entity6 citizens from a governmental benefit '
