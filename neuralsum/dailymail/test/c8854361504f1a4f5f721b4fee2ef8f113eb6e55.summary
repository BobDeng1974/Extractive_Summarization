twelve months ago , @entity2 were a free - flowing , potent attacking force with the @entity4 firing on all cylinders - the pair would eventually end up scoring 52 of @entity2 's 101 goals in the @entity10 season , however , the goals have dried up			1
replacing @entity5 was always going to be a near - impossible task , but @entity2 fans would have started the season quietly confident that the quality was there to collectively make up for the @entity17 's absence			2
unfortunately for @entity20 , things in the final third have not quite clicked in the final third in the way they did last season			0
@entity5 and @entity6 ( right ) scored 52 @entity26 goals for @entity2 last season @entity27 has struggled in front of goal this season , scoring only scored six @entity26 goals @entity34 ( centre ) celebrates scoring sixth goal of the season , a penalty against @entity33 on saturday with just seven games of the season left @entity2 have scored just 45 goals - compared to 84 at the same stage last season - and their top scorers - @entity27 , @entity34 and @entity44 - have scored six goals each			1
to put that into context , only @entity48 ( @entity47 and @entity49 - four ) and @entity50 ( @entity46 and @entity51 - four ) have top scorers with fewer @entity26 goals than @entity2			1
while @entity57 's top scorers @entity58 and @entity59 have also only managed six each			1
what the stats clearly show is that @entity2 have not filled the void left by @entity5 , they are missing a @entity63 ( 19 goals ) , a @entity65 ( also 19 ) , a @entity66 ( 17 ) , even a @entity67 ( 16 goals ) - and it has cost them dearly			2
@entity63 ( centre ) did n't score against @entity71 on sunday , but has 19 @entity26 goals this season @entity65 is the joint top scorer in the @entity26 with 19 goals in his first season in @entity75 @entity2 fans would argue that in @entity77 , who scored 21 league goals last term , they do have a player capable of scoring 20 + goals a season - and they are right			1
the @entity75 striker has had a frustrating season due to various injuries , and that is unfortunate , but @entity2 's others goal threats - @entity27 , @entity89 and @entity90 - simply have n't met the standards set by the @entity4 last season			1
some may also argue that while @entity2 lack a single focal point in attack , the group as a whole have picked up the slack			0
that may be true to an extent but @entity63 and @entity65 have scored more than @entity27 , @entity34 and @entity44 combined			2
and there can be little doubt that had @entity6 remained fit all season he would have more than six @entity26 goals by this stage of the season			0
the are mitigating circumstances for @entity2 , no doubt , but the stats do n't lie and the fact that no one person has grabbed the mantle left by @entity5 or @entity6 has proven costly for @entity2 - and may be a crucial reason why they miss out on @entity115 football next season			2
only @entity50 and @entity48 have top scorers with fewer @entity26 goals than @entity2 this season			1
@entity33 - @entity120 , @entity121			0
@entity57 - @entity58 , @entity59			0
@entity48 - @entity47 , @entity49			0
@entity2 - @entity27 , @entity44 , @entity34			1
@entity50 - @entity46 , @entity51			0
* @entity140 scored nine goals for @entity141 before moving to @entity130			0
the club 's current top scorer is @entity142 with seven goals .			0

@entity27 , @entity34 and @entity44 are @entity2 's top scorers in the @entity26 this season with six goals each
seventeen of 20 @entity26 clubs have top scorers with more goals
@entity2 are *paying* for failing to properly replace goals of @entity5
