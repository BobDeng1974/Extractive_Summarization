@entity0 is now lobbying officials in at least three states to stop proposed restrictions on driving with headsets such as @entity5			1
some eight @entity7 states are considering regulation of the company â€™s new product - a tiny computer screen mounted in the corner of an eyeglass frame			2
law enforcement and other groups are concerned that drivers wearing the devices will pay more attention to their email than the road , causing serious accidents			1
pre-emptive precaution : @entity5 is not yet on the open market but bans against the new technology , as modeled here by @entity0 ceo @entity26 , could cause problems for the gadget 's roll - out so - called wearables such as @entity5 , smart watches and sophisticated health devices may represent the next big shift in technology , just as smartphones evolved from personal computers , and enthusiasts predict billion - dollar markets			1
@entity0 , which is still testing @entity5 , charges $ 1,500 per pair			2
@entity0 has deployed lobbyists to persuade elected officials in @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42 that it is not necessary to restrict use of @entity5 behind the wheel , according to state lobbying disclosure records and interviews conducted by @entity47			1
legislators who introduced similar bills this year in three other states , @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53 , say they have not yet been contacted by @entity0			1
officials in @entity55 and @entity56 did not respond to inquiries from @entity47			1
last month in @entity62 , for instance , a woman 's traffic ticket for wearing @entity5 behind the wheel was dismissed because there was no proof the device was operating at the time			1
@entity0 's main point to legislators is that regulation would be premature because @entity5 is not yet widely available , the state elected officials say			1
other issues : @entity73 ( right ) was reportedly attacked in a @entity75 bar for wearing the $ 1,500 glasses @entity40 state senator @entity77 , a @entity79 @entity78 who introduced a @entity5 restriction bill in december , responded that it was clear the merchandise was heading for the broader public			1
' who are they fooling ? ' @entity77 said he recently met with @entity0 lobbyists trying to ' kill ' the bill , a position @entity77 suggested is driven by market considerations for the company			0
state records show the month after @entity77 introduced his bill , @entity0 retained @entity93 , a former political director for president @entity95 's former chief of staff and current @entity79 mayor @entity96			0
@entity93 visited @entity77 to lobby against the legislation , the state senator said			0
asked about its lobbying efforts , @entity0 said tech issues are a big part of current policy discussions in the states			0
' we think it is important to be part of those discussions , ' the company said in a statement			0
@entity0 has been scheduling @entity5 demonstrations across the country in an effort to educate the public on how the technology works			1
' while @entity5 is currently in the hands of a small group of @entity117 , find that when people try it for themselves they better understand the underlying principle that it 's not meant to distract but rather connect people more with the world around them , ' the company said in a statement			2
driving distraction : lawmakers fear that the @entity5 will pose similar dangers as texting while driving campaigns against distracted driving have gained significant traction in the @entity7			1
in 2012 , over 3,000 people died due to crashes where texting or other activities were in play , according to @entity134 , a @entity7 government web site devoted to the issue			0
@entity41 state rep. @entity138 was one of the primary sponsors of a bill that banned texting while driving , and he also introduced legislation targeting @entity5			1
so far , no states have passed @entity5 restrictions			2
' i 'm not against @entity0 or @entity5			2
it may have a place in society , ' said @entity138 , a @entity147			0
' my issue is that while you are driving , you should have nothing that is going to impede the concentration of the driver			0
' according to @entity138 , a @entity0 representative lobbied against the bill by forwarding a news article about the @entity62 court case , as an attempt to show that the courts are taking a dim view towards prosecutions			0
his bill passed committee and could receive a floor vote this spring , @entity138 said			0
@entity0 advises people engaged in @entity5 field tests to abide by state laws that limit use of mobile devices while driving			2
' above all , even when you 're following the law , do n't hurt yourself or others by failing to pay attention to the road , ' the company said in guidance posted online			0
not all legislators pushing a @entity5 restriction have been visited by the company , however			0
in @entity53 , @entity179 member @entity178 , a @entity147 , said he has heard from out - of - state @entity5 users opposed to the bill but not from the company itself			1
for @entity186 member @entity185 , the @entity62 traffic case shows a need for clear state laws			0
when a driver is pulled over , it will always be extremely difficult for law enforcement to prove whether @entity5 had been operating , said @entity185 , a @entity78			2
' the way to get around it is just to prohibit them altogether , ' he said .			0

lobbyists have contacted lawmakers in @entity40 , @entity42 and @entity41 over proposed bans that would stop drivers from wearing @entity5
similar proposals have been discussed in @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity55 and @entity56
lawmakers fear the small computer screens attached to glasses will prove to be a dangerous - and perhaps fatal - distraction for drivers
the new technology is not yet available for public *purchase* but is set to be more widely available soon
