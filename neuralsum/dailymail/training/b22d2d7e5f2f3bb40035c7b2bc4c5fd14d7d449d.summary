pregnant women could be given the anti-impotence drug @entity1 to boost the growth of underweight babies			1
a trial is underway to see if the little blue pill can boost survival in babies that are not growing properly in the womb			1
more than 120 women carrying extremely low - growth babies will be given regular doses of sildenafil citrate , a generic version of @entity1 , during their pregnancy			1
a previous study found that the sex drug @entity1 boosted blood flow to the placenta , which in turn promoted baby growth the results will then be compared with those from a similar group of women given an identical looking dummy tablet			1
the trial has been set up after laboratory studies suggested @entity1 , which was launched in the @entity29 in 1998 as the world 's first pill for erectile dysfunction , could help babies thrive in the womb by boosting the blood supply to the placenta			1
around 600 babies a year in the @entity29 are stillborn because of a pregnancy disorder called pre-eclampsia			0
the arteries feeding the placenta do not widen enough to deliver all the blood the baby needs			1
but during tests foetal deaths dropped sharply in pregnant mice given viagra			0
the drug helps by relaxing muscles in the artery walls and allowing more nutrient - rich blood to pump through			2
now scientists in @entity54 and @entity55 are recruiting pregnant women for the first human trial of @entity1 for foetal growth			2
around 600 babies a year in the @entity29 are stillborn because of a pregnancy disorder called pre-eclampsia			0
the arteries feeding the placenta do not widen enough to deliver all the blood the baby needs there is currently no treatment for growth restriction , other than early delivery once a baby is in danger , ' said dr @entity70 , who is leading the research at the @entity72			2
' if we can enhance foetal growth and delay delivery , we will improve babies ' survival rates and reduce the many complications that can lead to life - long disability or disease			2
' similar trials are planned for the @entity29 in the next few years			0
although @entity1 was launched to help men 's flagging sex lives , it has since found several other uses			1
the drug has been used to save the lives of both babies and adults suffering from a condition called pulmonary arterial hypertension , which affects around 4,000 people in the @entity29			0
blood pressure becomes dangerously high in the pulmonary artery , which carries blood from the right side of the heart to the small arteries in the lungs			0
but a @entity1 - based drug , called @entity1 , is extending the lives of some sufferers by boosting blood flow to the lungs , reducing the workload on the heart			1
the drug has also shown potential as a treatment for everything from breast cancer and diabetes to cold hands and heart attacks			0
findings from the initial trials in @entity54 and @entity55 are expected to emerge by early 2017 .			0
