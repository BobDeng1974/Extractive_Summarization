the next phase of work on the @entity3 's largest ever warship is underway , with the upper decks of the huge vessel gradually taking form			1
workers were seen on board @entity8 in @entity10 in @entity11 , some seven months after being first floated on the @entity12			1
she was unveiled by the @entity13 in 2014 after the ordinarily dry dock was flooded with water			1
the ship is @entity18 's largest ever maritime vessel weighing 65,000 tonnes and measuring 918ft from bow to stern			1
at almost 230ft , she stands as tall as @entity21 from the keel to the masthead			1
the project is expected to cost more than £ 6billion with the vessel , docked at @entity10 in @entity11 , the largest in the @entity3 's history @entity25 began on the ship in 2007			1
by the time work is completed , the ship will have enough space to carry 36 @entity37 fighter jets once completed she will have enough room to transport 36 @entity37 fighter jets , though only three of the 48 ordered from @entity42 manufacturers have so far been delivered			0
the ship 's hull was beginning to take form today with some of its nine decks becoming visible			1
the cost of fitting out the ship has spiraled drastically since plans for its construction were revealed			1
in 2008 an initial contract for its completion was priced at £ 3.2billion			1
two years later the bill was put at £ 5.2billion , with the most recent figures indicating it will cost more than £ 6billion to complete			1
last summer 80,000 tons of steel , 3.4million yards of cabling and 90,000 pipe spools had already been used in its construction			0
among its features is a huge lifting platform which will be able to bring jets and helicopters to the flight deck in less than a minute			2
but since work began in 2007 an estimated 10,000 people have been employed in building the ship			1
once in use she will employ a crew of fewer than 700			0
@entity75 @entity74 , a sister ship , is also undergoing extensive construction work			0
the vessels have been heralded by the @entity3 as future flagships for the @entity80			0
from 2020 , their primary use will be in transporting 36 @entity37 fighter jets			2
artists impressions of the ship 's flight deck released before construction was underway			2
when completed the vessel will have enough room for dozens of aircraft in july 2014 the warship was floated out of @entity92 for the first time after it was filled with water			1
an estimated 10,000 people will have worked on her construction by the time it is complete at 72,000 tons and 932 feet long , the @entity8 aircraft carrier is taller than @entity101 and considerably wider than the @entity102 at its widest point at 72,000 tons and 932 feet long , the @entity8 aircraft carrier is taller than @entity101 and considerably wider than the @entity102 at its widest point			1
she generates enough energy to power @entity106 , she can produce 500 tons of fresh water a day - and travel 500 miles a day , too			2
above all , she will be able to deliver 36 f - 35 lightning strike fighters and 1,000 troops from the largest piece of @entity18 sovereign territory afloat			1
her sister ship , the @entity74 , is already in production , though it has still not been decided whether she will be operational , mothballed or sold			0
each ship , which has a life expectancy of around 50 years , will be fitted out with more than three million metres of cable and it will have enough power to light up a small town			2
this week , the defence secretary , @entity120 , described the project as a feat of engineering to match the @entity124			0
you could say much the same about the price - more than £ 6 billion for the pair			2
and that does not include the planes			0
each 65,000 - tonne aircraft carrier will provide the armed forces with a four - acre military operating base , which can be deployed worldwide , operating the @entity37 and a number of types of helicopter			2
at full capacity , the carrier will be able to launch an aircraft every 30 seconds			0
they will be versatile enough to be used across the full spectrum of military activity , from war fighting to providing humanitarian aid and disaster relief			0
@entity8 will have 679 permanent crew and capacity for 1,600 crew members when fully operational			2
the ship features a new style of ' twin island ' command points - one at the front for steering and one at the back for aircraft direction			0
thanks to the cutting - edge technology on board , commanders on the bridge will be able to see 250 miles away			0
the carrier 's range is said to be 10,000 nautical miles and the ship is fitted with a long range @entity163 that is capable of tracking more than 1,000 targets at once or spotting a tennis ball travelling at 2,000 miles per hour			1
until then however the ships , which each have 4 - acre hangar decks , will carry helicopters			0
sea trials are expected to begin next year , the @entity3 's website predicts			0
experts at @entity174 working on the carriers created an app - called @entity176 - to assist them in finding their way around the unprecedented scale and complexity of the ships , where even routine journeys can take up to 20 minutes			2
speaking before it was unveiled for the first time in july , senior naval officer captain @entity182 said : ' what we will get as the @entity18 is the most amazing piece of military capability that really will be flexible and be able to provide our politicians and our military planners with choice , depending on what comes in the future			1
' they provide a real joint defence asset to deliver air power using the freedom of the world ’s oceans to influence what happens on land			0
' @entity8 in all her glory : an artists impression reveals the decks of new 65,000 - ton @entity3 warship that will be able to carry 2,300 crew and enough space to transport 36 @entity37 fighter jets the massive vessel will be as long as twenty eight @entity211 buses which is three times bigger than @entity18 's previous biggest aircraft carriers since work began in 2007 , an estimated 10,000 shipyard workers and engineers have been employed in building the ship which will employ a crew of fewer than 700 once complete reflecting on the construction work carried out to this point , he added : ' it ’s just fantastic			1
i arrived here over a year ago and there was one relatively small block in the dock			0
' the ship now is structurally complete and it ’s been really exciting watching her come together			0
my crew are just as excited and proud as i am			0
' the queen elizabeth class carriers are part of the @entity234 , a joint venture between @entity174 , @entity236 , @entity237 and the @entity18 @entity238			2
project manager @entity239 , the systems delivery director for the @entity234 , said : ' it ’s a huge undertaking , a @entity18 - wide national endeavour involving up to 10,000 people , including multiple companies within the alliance and the supply chain			1
' it really has been a long journey , a fantastic journey , to get to this point and there is a lot more work to be done as we get ready for the second ship , @entity74			0
' six shipyards around the @entity18 have been involved in the project to build the @entity8 which is currently based at huge @entity255 in @entity256 last summer 80,000 tons of steel , 3.4million yards of cabling and 90,000 pipe spools had already been used in the construction of the ship and work is still underway to bring the project in on its estimated £ 6.2billion budget the queen unveils @entity8 with prince @entity120 in a ceremony on the @entity267 in july			1
the ship will be launched for sea trials in 2016			0
