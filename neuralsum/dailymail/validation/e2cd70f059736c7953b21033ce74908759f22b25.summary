@entity0 have come under fire again , this time for an ad that depicts the gang rape of a woman			1
just days after designers @entity0 and @entity0 called children born through @entity10 ' synthetic , ' critics of the brand have publicized the brand 's highly controversial @entity13 campaign ad that showed a woman being restrained by a bare - chested man as a group of men in various states of undress look on			1
the advertisement was banned from being used in @entity22 publications after it ran several times when it was determined that it ' offended the dignity of the woman , ' and pulled in the @entity25 after running just once in an issue of @entity27			2
when the ad was first pulled in @entity30 , the design duo referred to the people of that country as ' a bit backward			1
' the ad actually features one of @entity50 's former costars on the @entity62 reality series @entity61 , model @entity63			2
the duo also depicted a group sex scene featuring all men in another ad that was slightly more graphic , though the man , unlike the woman , was not being restrained			1
@entity0 said in the most recent issue of @entity72 magazine ; ' you are born and you have a father and a mother			2
at least it should be like that			0
' that 's why i 'm not convinced by what i call chemical children , synthetic babies			0
' they are wombs for hire , semen chosen from a catalogue			0
and then you have to explain to these children who their mother is			0
' this after the men chose motherhood as the theme of their @entity93 fashion show held earlier this month in @entity94			0
parents of @entity10 babies , among them @entity97 , @entity98 , and @entity99 , came out against the two following these statements , as did celebrities including @entity102 and @entity103			1
@entity50 ( left ) posted the old ad on her @entity53 , attacking @entity0 and @entity0 ( right ) @entity97 wrote on @entity105 following then incident ; ' how dare you refer to my beautiful children as " synthetic "			1
and shame on you for wagging your judgemental little fingers at @entity10 - a miracle that has allowed legions of loving people , both straight and gay , to fulfil their dream of having children			2
' your archaic thinking is out of step with the times , just like your fashions			0
i shall never wear @entity0 ever again			0
' now many have publicly declared they will boycott the duo 's designs			0
@entity0 meanwhile have said their statements were taken out of context , with @entity0 saying ; ' i am very well aware of the fact that there are other types of families and they are as legitimate as the one i 've known			1

@entity0 have come under fire for a 2007 ad that depicts the gang rape of a woman who is being restrained as a group of men look on
publicist @entity50 posted the ad on @entity53 , noting ; ' i guess simulating gang bangs are fine - but @entity10 and same sex *marriage* are not '
the ad was *ultimately* pulled soon after it ran back in 2007 , though the duo referred to people who were offended as ' a bit backward '
this just days after designers @entity0 and @entity0 were attacked when they called @entity10 babies ' synthetic '
parents of @entity10 babies , *inclduing* @entity97 and @entity99 , came out against the design duo
@entity0 said that the comment was taken out of context , noting that all families are ' legitimate '
