the days of scrambling for a phone charger are coming to an end , as more people embrace wireless charging technology			1
and now it ’s been proven that an @entity5 can even be charged underwater , using a wireless pad and a mobile receiver fitted inside a waterproof @entity9 case			1
the @entity5 handset was sealed inside the case , along with a receiver , and dropped onto a wireless charging pad into a tub of liquid			1
@entity26 , founder of @entity28 , based in @entity29 , @entity30 , conducted the experiment to prove the firm ’s @entity32 can be used inside a sealed case			1
measuring just half a millimetre thick , the receiver is designed to be used with any wireless pad			1
it sits under a soft case , or @entity9 case , plugging into an @entity5 ’s @entity42 connector port			1
it uses a theory initially suggested by @entity45 , who demonstrated the principle of wireless charging at the turn of the century			2
experimental : the @entity5 handset was sealed inside a waterproof case and dropped into a tub of water ( pictured left ) , so it landed on top of the wireless charging pad			1
the pad stayed dry because it was plugged in beneath the container ( right ) @entity26 , founder of @entity28 , based in @entity29 , @entity30 , conducted the experiment to prove the firm ’s receiver can be used inside a sealed case			1

wireless charging , also known as inductive charging , requires two coils : a transmitter and a receiver			1
an alternating current is passed through the transmitter coil , generating a magnetic field			0
this in turn induces a voltage in the receiver coil ; this can be used to power a mobile device or charge a battery			2
it requires two coils - a transmitter and a receiver			0
an alternating current is passed through the transmitter coil , generating a magnetic field			0
this in turn induces a voltage in the receiver coil , which can be used to power a mobile device or charge a battery			2
in the case of the @entity32 device , the transmitter coil is thin because the circuits are printed , enabling it to fit inside a phone case and be almost ‘ invisible ’			1
‘ the technology ’s improving , but we ’re still at phase one , ' mr @entity105 told @entity109			0
he expects we ’ll be able to charge our smartphones at greater distances wirelessly within the next decade			0
he added it is the first time , to his knowledge that wireless technology , has been used to charge a phone underwater , because ‘ no - one else makes this kind of receiver that can fit under a @entity9 case , ’ enabling an @entity5 to stay dry and fully functional			1
he believes there is demand for the technology , which may appeal to divers and seamen			0
while the technology has many benefits in a watery environment , mr @entity105 said that it is around 75 per cent efficient compared to simply charging a phone from a plug socket			0
the @entity32 receiver costs £ 14.99 and does not come with a wireless charging pad , or @entity9 case			1
invisible : the thin receiver sits under a soft case , or @entity9 case , plugging into an @entity5 ’s @entity136 ( pictured ) scientists in the @entity138 have developed a device that could charge your phone at a distance - even while it ’s still in your pocket – so you will never run out of juice again			1
the prototype @entity148 wireless charger can charge an iphone 4 battery in five hours , at a distance of 12 inches ( 30cm ) away , it was reported in september			2
while wireless chargers already exist , they require a phone to be placed directly on a charging ‘ pad ’ so users still have to remember to charge their phones and place them on the device in the right way			2
@entity159 , of the @entity160 ( @entity160 ) who is behind the new technology , told @entity163 : ‘ in our vision we wanted to have people 's phone charge the minute they are sitting next to their desk : they go to a meeting , they come back , the phone starts charging again			2
’ the prototype uses a magnetic coil to beam energy to a phone around 12 inches away and it does n't matter how the phone is positioned – so it could be lying on a desk or in someone ’s pocket			0
the idea is that coils could one day be placed around homes and offices to top up the batteries of devices detected nearby			0
‘ @entity148 consumes as much power as existing solutions , yet it can charge a phone remotely without being removed from the user 's pocket , ’ dr @entity159 and her team wrote in a paper which they shared at the @entity187 in @entity188 , @entity189			0
@entity148 's transmitter has a number of coils inside to that generate a magnetic field			0
when a phone enters that field , its presence is detected by the transmitter			0
it then focuses its energy on the phone that is within range by generating varying frequencies			0
this creates a stronger overall magnetic field that can reach the phone			0
it 's hoped that the technology could help speed the take - up of smart watches , which will likely need to be charged daily , such as the @entity214 , which supports wireless charging .			2

@entity5 handset was sealed inside a @entity9 case and submerged
it was placed on top of a wireless pad outside the container to charge
case *conceals* a thin @entity32 receiver to make wireless charging possible
the experiment was carried out to prove the firm ’s receiver can be used inside a sealed case
