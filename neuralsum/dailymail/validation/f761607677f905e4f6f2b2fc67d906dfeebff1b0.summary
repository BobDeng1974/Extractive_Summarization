@entity0 has no doubts who he will be shouting for if two particular horses are galloping clear to the final fence in friday ’s @entity5			1
one , @entity7 - trained @entity6 , owned by @entity8 , ridden by soon - to - retire 19 - time champion jockey @entity9 , will be carrying a hill of punters ’ money and a mountain of sentimental support			1
the other , @entity15 , a winner at the last two festivals and who showed his old sparkle when winning his warm - up race at @entity20 last month under @entity9 , is @entity0 ’s main hope for a big win this week			1
trainer and ex-jockey @entity0 pictured at @entity24 ahead of next week 's @entity25 @entity9 ( left ) and trainer @entity0 pictured with @entity27 and the @entity5 in 2012 with @entity8 being @entity0 ’s landlord and staunchest supporter , and @entity9 his long - time ally , who helped deliver both the 2012 @entity5 on @entity27 and 2010 @entity30 on @entity31 , it might seem at best a difficult dilemma and at worst a nightmare scenario			1
but @entity0 is clear where his support will lie			1
‘ i will be shouting for @entity15			1
the rent may go up but we will talk about that later , ’ he says , as he looks out over the famous strip of @entity24 turf that has defined his career			2
the arduous climb to the finishing post was the scene of the two - time champion jockey ’s 1980 @entity46 win on @entity48 and , even more memorably , the heart - stopping surge to the line on 1986 @entity5 - winning mare @entity53			1
do n’t be fooled by the sparkling smile and twinkling eyes			0
@entity0 might come over like a cross between @entity57 and your favourite uncle but he has not risen to the top of the racing ladder by being soft - hearted			1
‘ i knew if @entity8 had a runner @entity63 would ride it			0
he pays the retainer , ’ he says			0
‘ @entity66 will ride @entity15 and they get on really well			1
they have clicked and @entity66 has twice won on him at @entity24			0
he has won at two festivals so hopefully he can make it three in a row			0
’ @entity15 is one of @entity0 's main hope for a big win in the @entity74 @entity9 ( right ) and @entity75 ( left ) pictured with @entity76 after winning the @entity30 while @entity0 is determined to deny @entity9 the big final @entity25 send - off the jockey is hoping for , that does n’t mean he is not desperate to provide him with a winner despite the blow of one of their big hopes , last year ’s @entity84 winner more of that , missing the meeting			1
they have become more than just employer and employee and no one is better placed to assess @entity9 than @entity0 , a man who rode against a generation of former weighing room giants including @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 and @entity97			1
‘ there is a piece of everybody in him , ’ says the man who has trained 25 @entity25 winners			0
‘ some fellas are a great judge of pace but would n’t be able to produce a horse at a fence			0
he is the complete all - rounder			2
‘ he knows the pace , the tracks and the ground			0
he has ridden north , south , east and west and knows what every other horse in the race and their jockeys will be doing			2
he knows who to follow and who not to follow			0
‘ basically , he is a freak and he loves winning , which is great			0
’ @entity25 observers have learned to set their watch by @entity0 , who has only twice driven away from the last day without a winner since the turn of the century			2
the signs are again positive with 22 winners since the start of february an indicator that his string is back in form			0
@entity0 is determined to deny @entity9 the big final @entity25 send - off the jockey is hoping for @entity0 , who has trained 25 @entity134 winners , described @entity9 as a freak that loves winning that is in stark contrast to dark days when the whole of november , a blank december and january yielded only 11 victories			1
‘ it was very bleak , ’ said @entity0			2
the barren patch scuppered hopes of launching an outside challenge for the trainers ’ title that had been made possible by a bright start to the season			0
that remains the @entity0 ambition but one hampered , he feels , by the wrong perception he is @entity8 ’s private trainer			1
he says : ‘ one day , hopefully , i will be champion trainer			2
we are an open house and there is nobody who enjoys us having winners for other people more than @entity8			0
‘ i knew we did n’t have the firepower [ this year ] but were expecting to have a better season with the better horses			0
hopefully , they will finish off the season better			0
’ no one will be surprised if he does			0
course specialist @entity165 in the @entity168 and @entity169 , winner of the @entity171 ’ @entity168 last season and possibly heading down the handicap route , both have claims and a @entity25 gamble on an @entity0 handicapper is almost obligatory			2
but it is @entity15 , winner of the 2013 @entity177 and what is now the @entity179 last year , who leads the @entity0 charge			1
the trainer describes the eight - year - old , who is transformed by blinkers , as a ‘ little con man ’			2
if he dashes the @entity9 ’s @entity5 run , party pooper might be more appropriate .			1

the 2015 @entity134 starts begins on *tuesday* next week
@entity0 's main hope for a big win is @entity15 in the @entity5
@entity9 will be riding @entity6 in the same race
@entity9 and @entity195 are long - time allies but the trainer will be cheering for @entity15 rather than his old friend
