by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 07:45 est , 25 november 2013 updated : 11:39 est , 25 november 2013 @entity2 has called in lawyers to investigate claims it ruined successful small firms to maximise its own profits			1
the state - backed lender has hired legal firm @entity9 after a damning report said it acted like a ‘ hit squad ’ by deliberately causing healthy businesses to go bust			2
business secretary @entity14 said he was ' appalled ' by the claims which chancellor @entity16 said were ' shocking '			0
it is understood the allegations focus on @entity2 ' @entity19 ( @entity20 ) lending division , which handles loans classed as being risky @entity2 and @entity23 faced claims they ‘ harmed their customers through their decisions and caused their financial downfall ’			1
in the worst cases , @entity2 withdrew lines of credit for previously solvent firms by charging eye - watering fees and charges so it could then seize their assets – typically property – at knockdown prices			1
@entity39 is also singled out in the extraordinary allegations in an independent report commissioned by the government			0
entrepreneur @entity43 was asked by mr cable to look into small business lending			2
he accuses many of @entity47 ’s banks of ‘ heavy - handed profiteering and abhorrent behaviour ’			0
mr @entity14 has passed the report to sir @entity52 - the former deputy governor of the @entity53 , who has also published his full review into small business lending at @entity2 today			1
chancellor @entity16 ( left ) said the report was ' shocking ' while business secretary @entity14 said he was ' appalled ' at the idea banks forced healthy business to go bust a spokeswoman for @entity2 - 80 per cent owned by the taxpayer - confirmed that it had now hired law firm @entity9 to look into the claims			1
@entity64 , the banking group ’s new chief executive , confirmed lawyers had been called in in a a letter to sir @entity52			0
he did not make direct reference to the @entity43 report , but wrote : ' to ensure our customers can have full confidence in our commitment to them , i have asked the law firm @entity9 to conduct an inquiry into this matter , reporting back to me in the new year			0
' @entity2 staff are turning away too many small business loans at an early stage partly because they face increasing sanctions for putting through applications that ' turn bad ' , a review has found			1
the report by former @entity53 deputy governor sir @entity52 found that up to 10 per cent of small and medium enterprises ( @entity86 ) rejected at a pre-application stage may in fact be suitable for financing			2
it means that while state - backed @entity2 performs better than other lenders on dealing with @entity86 loan applications , this is partly due to the fact that it screens out more potential borrowers before the application stage , sir @entity52 found			2
the report also made reference to accusations about the bank ' hastening the failure of businesses ' in some cases that are also the subject of a report by business secretary @entity14 's adviser @entity43			2
@entity86 financing is critical because it is seen as key to a sustainable economic recovery			0
but overall @entity2 , which is 80 per cent - owned by the taxpayer , converted one in four of all business approaches into lending , slightly lower than the market average			1
he admitted @entity2 ' over-corrected for the reckless lending practices that broke this bank five years ago '			1
' we can never return to those days again and your report recognises the steps we have taken to re-balance and stabilise the bank			0
' but in many cases the pendulum of risk aversion has swung too hard to one side			0
as you have identified , there are loans that we could , and should , be making , but are not			0
' last night mr @entity43 said if it was proved there was ‘ systematic and institutional fraud ’ at the banks , ‘ you should see people going to jail ’			0
his report reserved its most damning criticism for taxpayer - backed @entity2 and @entity23			1
he said : ‘ it is undeniable that some of the banks , @entity2 and @entity23 in particular , are harming their customers through their decisions and causing their financial downfall			1
’ the allegation will be a major embarrassment for both lenders and the government , which owns an 82 per cent stake in @entity2 and 43 per cent in @entity23			1
mr @entity43 , the founding chairman of the @entity146 , which employs more than 2,000 people , told @entity148 : ‘ we ’re really concerned that the businesses are n’t really struggling and are pushed over the edge			0
and then these extra fees tip them over administration , and then you ’ve got the loss of jobs but end up with @entity2 owning the property			2
‘ if it is proved that this is systemic and institutional fraud , and there is quite a lot of evidence from people within the bank that this is the case , then the relevant action should be taken			0
if people have had their livelihoods stolen from them , you should see people going to jail			0
’ the report claims to have uncovered ‘ very concerning patterns of behaviour leading to the destruction of good and viable @entity47 businesses ’			2
it suggests @entity2 engineered businesses to default on their loans to move them into a special division called @entity19 ( @entity20 )			1
once in @entity20 the firms were then hit with exorbitant rates and fees , which in some cases caused them to collapse , allowing @entity2 to buy their property and assets on the cheap , the report claims			1
@entity2 and @entity185 harmed their customers through their decisions and caused their financial downfall ¿ , according to the bombshell report @entity189 and his wife @entity190 lost more than £ 1million , their livelihood and their marriage after borrowing from @entity2			1
the couple bought the @entity194 in @entity195 in 2007 for £ 3.7 million , using £ 1.2million of their own money and taking out a loan from the bank			0
a condition of the loan was that they had to take out an interest rate swap to protect them when base rates increased , but this led to them paying high fixed interest on their loans and an additional £ 120,000 a year in penalties as rates tumbled			0
after the hotel was placed in @entity2 ’s @entity19 it was valued at just £ 1.8 million			2
by the autumn of 2011 , the business was pushed into administration			0
@entity2 property company @entity215 bought the hotel for £ 1.4 million several months later			2
the bank claims the business may only just break even when it is sold but mr @entity189 says it could soon be worth £ 4 million as the property market recovers			1
he said : ‘ they stole it			0
even if the property market was depressed it would be worth £ 3 million			0
’ mr @entity14 said he was ' appalled ' by what mr @entity43 found			0
' i was appalled by what he said ... just to explain @entity43 is what we call an entrepreneur in residence			0
' he ’s a @entity229 businessperson who had himself had a lot of problems with @entity2 but he compiled a dossier of cases which suggested that there was a systematic pattern here going back to 2009 where good companies which were n’t bringing enough fee income to the bank were being brought down deliberately			1
' mr @entity43 said he was calling for ‘ immediate action to stop this unscrupulous treatment of businesses ’			0
the report recommends that @entity2 and @entity23 be made significantly smaller , removing conflicts of interest within the banks , and creating a number of smaller , purely retail commercial banks			1
the @entity250 launched its make the @entity252 campaign three years ago , to highlight the plight of small firms in accessing credit , but mr @entity43 ’s findings show many small businesses are still being unfairly treated			1
mr @entity14 said evidence against @entity2 in the report had been referred to the @entity260 and the @entity261			1
@entity263 , of the @entity264 ’ @entity262 , said : ‘ this is shocking news for taxpayers who bailed out these banks to the tune of billions of pounds			0
’ a spokesman for @entity2 said : ‘ @entity20 successfully turns around most of the businesses it works with , but in all cases is working with customers at a time of significant stress in their lives			1
' not all businesses that encounter serious financial trouble can be saved			2
’ a spokesman for @entity23 said : ‘ the specific practices discussed in the report are attributed to another bank and are not a reflection of @entity39 ’s approach			1

@entity285 claims @entity2 and @entity23 have deliberately caused small firms to fail
@entity2 , 80 per cent owned by taxpayer , referred to financial *watchdogs*
bank claims it tried to help the businesses , ' but ca *n't* save all of them '
@entity2 admits it ' over-corrected ' for reckless lending which caused crash
