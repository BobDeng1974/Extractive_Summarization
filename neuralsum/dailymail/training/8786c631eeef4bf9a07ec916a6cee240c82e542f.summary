she made the life - changing decision to defect from the @entity3 to @entity4 earlier this year , to front new daytime show @entity6			2
but as @entity8 , 43 , made her debut on the fledgling programme on monday morning , viewers were quick to point out that the presenter 's best assets were not being utilised by the show 's bosses			1
shortly after the programme premiered at 6am , @entity15 was awash with comments from critics who complained that @entity8 's trim legs were being hidden because she spent the majority of the time sitting behind a desk with her co-hosts			1
' in fact , it was reported recently that @entity8 is earning a staggering £ 400,000 for her new role on @entity6 , which sees her host alongside @entity45 , 39 , @entity46 , 28 and @entity47 , 30			1
but the overwhelming opinion of viewers seemed to be that the desk was ruining their view , with another writing : ' you do n't hire @entity8 and then stick her behind a desk # getyourpinsout # @entity55			2
' new format : another sticking point for viewers was that the show is largely too americanised in its format line - up : the four presenters kicked off the show from behind the desk , before moving around the studio later in the programme spot the difference : the studio and the layout is incredibly similar to that of @entity71 other comments included : ' how to loose viewers from the off put @ susannareid100 behind a desk			2
she was popular for a reason			0
' another read : ' @entity4 's new breakfast show has no chance ! sticking @entity8 behind a desk ruins her appeal to half the viewership , lol ! @entity84 fail @entity4 ! ' later on the show , however , @entity8 moved from behind the desk , giving viewers the chance to catch a glimpse of her enviable pins			1
the big reveal : @entity8 later moved and showed off her legs in her knee - length dress much better ! @entity8 later got her legs out as she and @entity45 interviewed @entity93 standing out : @entity8 wore an eye - catching dress for her debut on the show speaking recently about the now infamous desk , and the new set of the show , @entity8 said : ' our set is different , fresh and it 's not what people have been used to over the last couple of years in breakfast television			1
' it is something new and exciting for us			0
we all start behind the desk , which has n't happened for a while			0
' the lack of legs on show was n't the only thing viewers complained about , as many argued that the new format was more @entity115 in style - similar to stateside shows such as @entity71			1
back for more : old favourites including celebrity correspondent @entity118 were back for the new show one viewer commented : ' @entity6 is too formal and newsy and like an @entity115 morning show			0
' while another added : ' well , @entity6 looks very @entity115 so far ... suited team behind desks , tickers , huge pic takes up half screen			0
' however , not all reactions to the show were negative , as one viewer wrote : ' totally loving # @entity6 # @entity55			0
' new faces : @entity8 and @entity45 are the main two hosts of the show completing the crew : @entity46 , 28 and @entity47 , 30 , complete the quartet and another commented on the amount of attractive female presenters on the show , tweeting : ' # @entity138 , @entity46 & @entity139 on the same channel ! i 'm in heaven ! ' even @entity144 presenter @entity143 commented on the format , admitting the hectic atmosphere of the show was too much for her to handle			2
she tweeted : ' just watching @entity6 ... there 's so much going on i need a little lie down			0
' as it was : @entity151 and @entity152 on @entity35 , before it was reinvented as @entity6 starting out : the set looked vastly different and much more sombre when @entity155 and @entity156 hosted it the @entity158 commented that @entity8 had appeared nervous for the first part of the show , before getting into her stride as the programme progressed			0
@entity163 commented : ' in her central role behind the desk , @entity8 initially seems the most nervous of the foursome – “ somebody ’s put some extra words in my head … look at me all discombobulated ” – quite possibly because she knows all eyes are on her as @entity4 ’s marquee signing			2
' @entity151 also commented on the @entity115 feel of the programme , with ' the screen seeming very cluttered with garish idents and info graphics '			0
it was confirmed over the weekend that after a two - week settling in period , @entity8 will only work from mondays to thursdays , with ex @entity35 star @entity180 standing in for her on fridays			1
early arrival : @entity8 was without make - up as she arrived for her first day on the show clutching her laptop and the day 's papers kicking things off : @entity8 is reportedly being paid a staggering £ 400,000 for her role on the show sitting pretty : @entity8 's previous role at @entity191 saw her put on a much more leggy display			1
