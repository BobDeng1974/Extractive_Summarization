@entity0 may have earned the title of fashionista thanks to her edit for @entity4 but another member of @entity6 is giving her a run for her money in the style stakes			0
@entity11 has just unveiled her debut fashion range for @entity13 and it 's full of trend - led flattering summer designs that she hopes every woman out there will look great in			1
speaking to @entity18 about the launch of the collection , @entity11 said : ' my new range is really print driven and i 've ensured that the pieces can be worn day to night , dressed up with heels and down with flats			2
she said : ' i 'm conscious now i 'm a mother and i 've made sure every single piece is really flattering ; i 've had lots of fun with it			0
she sure knows what works ! @entity11 , who gave birth to her daughter 14 months ago , has used her experience of motherhood to ensure that every piece in her new range flatters women and shows off their best assets ( jumpsuit , £ 55 ) inspiration : @entity11 , who cites @entity60 and @entity61 as her style icons , has used vertical stripes on her dresses because she believes they elongate a woman 's body ( dress , £ 39 ) ' i 've been very particular with the cuts of the clothes and there 's lots of jumpsuits , which i loved to wear during and after my pregnancy because they highlight my best bits - my arms and neck - and covered everything else ! ' using her own knowledge of what works , @entity11 has included vertical stripes in her 18 - piece range because , as she says , they elongate you , and has added plenty of playsuits and jumpsuits for days when ' you just do n't know what to wear '			1
the 25 - year - old , who cites @entity61 and @entity60 as her style icons , says she took inspiration from her friends when designing the range but also took sneaky snaps of stylish women in the street			1
colour clash : @entity11 has ensured that her 18 - piece range can be worn from day to night and dressed up with heels or down with flats real women : the singer says she does n't care for celebrities wearing her range but would love to see everyday women walking down the street in her designs and forget celebrity fans because @entity11 wants to see real women wearing her range			1
' women do n't often feel confident putting an outfit together and that 's what i want to change			2
i 'd love nothing more than walking down the street and seeing women wearing my clothes , ' she said			1
speaking about her husband 's style , @entity11 said : ' he does well by himself so i do n't offer much advice but i got rid of the low v - neck t - shirts , the time is up , @entity38 ! ' he said : " but i wore them when we dated " and i said : " oh yes , but i knew i could change you ! "			0
' the husband and wife duo will be covering for @entity128 and @entity129 on this morning as they take their summer break , but @entity11 has still had time to squeeze in another clothing range for the e-tailer			2
' my @entity135 stuff for very is ready to go , ' she said			0
' @entity136 , i 'm covered for the rest of the year			0
' style shake - up : @entity11 said that she has made @entity38 ditch the v - neck shirts he loved in his @entity39 days , right showcasing her work : @entity11 launched her designs at a fashion show last week in central @entity143 keeping the seat warm : @entity11 and @entity38 will be covering for @entity128 and @entity129 on this morning as they take their summer break			0
