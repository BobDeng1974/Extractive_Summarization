this was the apocalyptic scene yesterday as fire engulfed a recycling plant in what witnesses described as ‘ @entity12 ’			1
the cause ? a single @entity15 lantern			1
the lantern drifted down on to a bale of plastic and within minutes the flames were spreading through some 100,000 tons of recycling – worth £ 6million			2
more than 200 firefighters have been tackling the blaze on an industrial estate in @entity24 , near @entity25 , in the biggest blaze @entity27 has ever seen			1

more than 35 fire engines as well as police and ambulance crews rushed to the scene at the @entity56 recycling plant where they battled throughout the night to control the flames			1
the smouldering wreckage of the gutted building is still burning today and fire bosses warned the sheer scale of the blaze means it could burn all week			2
thick plumes of black smoke billowed up to 6,000ft in the air and could be seen over 80 miles away including @entity66 , @entity67 and by hundreds of motorists driving on the @entity70 and @entity71 motorways towards @entity72			2
area commander @entity73 , revealed it was the biggest blaze the @entity76 's second largest fire service had seen in their 40 - year history			1
he said : ' a @entity15 lantern was spotted on @entity79 floating across and into the site and starting a fire in plastic bales			1
' ' we have n't evacuated any of the local residents because this is mainly an industrial area but we have had some minor injuries to some of our firefighters at the scene			2
' choking : the fire created a 6,000ft tall spiral of smoke			2
those living nearby were urged to keep their windows closed glare : the fire is believed to be the biggest to have ever struck the @entity97			1
as well as the recycling plant , a factory unit is also involved teamwork : more than 35 fire engines from emergency services throughout the region were called to the raging fire blaze : there were fears the smoke would cause a delay to flights at @entity110 , although none have been reported so far an aerial photo of the burning mountain of waste			1

firefighters had to to use plant machinery to ' break up ' the bales of plastic to get at the heart of the fire huge mission : three firefighters were hospitalised and a further eight were injured bringing the inferno caused by a @entity15 sky lantern that landed at the site - under control he said : ' my forensics people have been here from the start and have reviewed @entity79 and and spoken to people and looked at the way the fire started and looking at the @entity79 evidence , you can see a @entity15 lantern floating gently , and then land and then eight minutes later you see the fire start			1
' he said the @entity193 had previously called for a review of the use of @entity15 lanterns and said it was time that ' sensible people have a sensible discussion ' about the issue			1
