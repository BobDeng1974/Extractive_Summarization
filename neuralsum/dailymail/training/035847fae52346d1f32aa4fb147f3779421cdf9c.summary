scientists have mapped the quietest places in @entity2 , as well as some of the noisiest			1
researchers from the @entity5 collected more than 1.5million hours of acoustical monitoring data from around the country and found that the quietest areas were in national parks			1
the team found sound levels that are as quiet as before @entity13 colonization in some wild places of the country , according to @entity15			1
scientists from the @entity5 used a computer program to map the noise levels throughout the entire country			1
this map shows the combined decibel levels from both natural and human - made noise , which ranged from below 30 decibels to above 60 national parks , such as @entity24 in @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27 , were the quietest places in the entire country , with low levels of human noise while the most peaceful places saw less than 20 decibels of background noise on a typical summer day , places such as @entity32 can average up to 60 decibels			1
the map shows a stark difference between the noisy eastern half of the country and the @entity39 , where large swaths of land see measurements below 30 decibels			0
noise is measured logarithmically in decibels , with a jet engine around 100 decibels , an office environment measured at about 60 and a whisper at 20			0
the quietest places in the @entity2 are found at the @entity49 and westward , with secluded areas such as @entity24 in @entity25 and @entity51 in @entity52 leading the way			1
@entity54 in @entity55 was also among the quietest , lead author dr @entity57 told @entity58			0
urban environments and towns along the interstate system got the noisiest ratings , according to maps from a study by dr @entity57 , dr @entity66 and dr @entity67			0
researchers have previously pointed out how long - term exposure to loud background noise can cause health problems			0
dr @entity66 has said that constant noise may be creating a ' deaf generation ' that is unable to use our bodies ' ability to hear sounds far away			0
the researchers also made a map of the country 's noise if humans were taken out of the equation ( above )			0
large amounts of natural noise , which was mapped on a smaller scale than the total noise , was found in areas with rivers and insects , such as the @entity91 the naturally noisiest parts of the country include the area around the @entity95 ( pictured ) while naturally quiet places were generally high , dry shrubland however , the difference between the bustling @entity99 and the more peaceful @entity39 was not only limited to areas with large amounts of human development			1
a map of sounds created by natural sources , where scientists redid the map as if there were no people , also shows a country split in half			2
warm areas in the @entity91 and interior @entity113 saw high values and appear in yellow , though the scale for the amount of noise is smaller than for when human sounds are included			1
non-human noise came mostly from running water , rain and ' wind - induced vegetation sounds '			2
the wetlands and area around the @entity95 also support a huge amount of wildlife and the constant buzz of insects can be heard even in areas with few or no people			2
humans ' contribution to the noise levels were mapped by subtracting the natural levels from the soundscape ( seen above )			2
even areas without large human populations saw man - made noise from roads and airplanes flying overhead big cities such as @entity32 ( pictured ) can see background noise levels as high as 60 decibels , roughly the same as an office environment or a conversation in a restaurant the quietest places in terms of natural sounds were high , dry shrubland and barren , flat terrain '			1
dr @entity57 and his team then measured the affect that humans have on the soundscape by finding the difference between the total noise and natural noise levels			2
even remote spots saw some man - made noise , with the rumble of aircraft overheard destroying the natural stillness			2
other patches of would - be quiet were also broken up by roads or other transportation networks			0
one aircraft can be heard 25 miles from from its path and cars can be heard six miles from the road , the study said			0
the largest areas without large amounts of unnatural noise were the @entity176 in northern @entity177 and parts of the @entity49			1
half of ' low impact ' areas were in protected lands			0
the scientists were unable to collect data from every point in the entire country , and used @entity187 , a ' tree - based machine learning algorithm ' to create their maps			0
though the researchers originally began looking just at the country 's national parks , their more recent research has included data from urban areas and airports			1
the noise study 's combined map bears a striking resemblance to @entity201 's map of nighttime light , with much of the activity clustered around humans in big cities			0

@entity5 scientists created maps of human and natural noise
quietest places are national parks such as @entity24 ; cities are loudest
some areas can be as quiet as they were before @entity13 colonization
large amounts of natural noise from water and insects heard in @entity91
