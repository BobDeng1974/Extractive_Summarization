by @entity0 wind farms and flyovers which block some of the country ’s most glorious views are one of the biggest threats to @entity8 ’s cultural heritage , the chief executive of @entity10 has said			1
@entity11 said his ‘ biggest challenge ’ was to find ways to stop the erection of wind farms and other eyesores from obscuring historic buildings and monuments			1
he said : ‘ my focus , and the focus of @entity10 , is to design ways we can judge the effect , of wind farms for instance , and other structures , that have an effect on the aesthetics of buildings			1
‘ that is the biggest challenge we have today			2
’ @entity30 : proposed wind farms will block some of the country ¿ s most glorious views , according to a heritage chief dr @entity11 said the legislation that exists to protect monuments and historical buildings was ‘ too old ’			1
changes were needed to laws so that the views of listed buildings were protected as well as the buildings themselves , he told the audience at the @entity44			1
‘ @entity45 believed legislation should protect the physicality of buildings , but quite often it is n’t the physicality you are trying to protect , ’ he said			1
@entity11 , chief executive of @entity10 , said his ' biggest challenge ' was to find ways to stop wind farms and other eyesores being built dr @entity11 gave the example of @entity56 , in @entity57 , where he said @entity10 was fighting plans to build a flyover that would block views of the historic cathedral ‘ rising from the @entity62 ’			2
‘ the heritage legislation we have today was not designed to protect the views of @entity66 , ’ he said			0
‘ it was designed to stop ( people ) bashing it down			0
’ dr @entity11 said his other big challenge was getting 1970s concrete buildings listed			1
‘ we have to work out which ones are worth saving because there ’s a lot of junk , ’ he said			0
he added for years government ministers had refused to allow them to be listed and viewed them as ‘ monstrosities ’ - particularly @entity79 , who when she was @entity82 , ‘ refused to list any concrete buildings at all ’			2
but the current minister @entity83 was far more obliging , he said , and had most recently agreed to the listing of the ‘ concrete megastructure ’ of @entity87 bus station			0
dr @entity11 also revealed that more than 400 buildings currently owned and run by @entity10 were going to be transferred to a charity			2
he said : ‘ like all ( government ) departments we have been absolutely hammered with cuts recently and it ’s been very hard for us			0
‘ i think the best future for them ( the sites ) is in a charity			0
’ but he said the sites would go under the protection of a new charity and would not be handed to the @entity101 because ‘ we need competition ’			0
‘ the two organisations ( @entity10 and the @entity101 ) have a very , very different approach , ’ he said , adding it was ‘ healthier ’ that way			0
dr @entity11 has been chief executive of @entity10 since 2002 , and was dubbed the ‘ boy wonder ’ for being given the role at the age of 39			0
he added that existing legislation is not adequate to protect the beauty spots of @entity8			1

preservation *expert* says vistas of @entity8 are in *danger* of being *blighted*
he says laws to *preserve* monuments and buildings are *outdated*
