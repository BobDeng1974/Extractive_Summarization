@entity0 and @entity1 kick off the @entity3 play - offs on thursday , just as they launched the regular season more than seven months earlier , and the @entity1 are confident of obtaining a similar result			1
@entity7 's men stunned the 2013 champions by pulling off a 24 - 8 victory at the @entity10 in early february , just before the @entity11 set off for @entity12 to play in the @entity13			1
@entity0 lost just once more at home in @entity3 as they went on to secure a second - place finish thanks to impressive back - to - back wins over @entity17 and @entity18 - but @entity1 will have no fears about travelling to the @entity10 , where they have won on seven of their last 10 visits			1
@entity0 captain @entity23 is determined to end his team 's hoodoo over @entity1 , with @entity1 ' forward @entity26 is hoping his side can improve on a disappointing season last term warriors captain @entity23 said : ' they 've been a bogey team for us over the last couple of years			1
' they play well against us and we know we 'll have to play as well as we did in the last couple of games if we want to get a win			0
' the last two games have both been like play - off games , where both sides wanted the result			2
they were both tough , physical games which are what the play - offs are going to be like			0
' @entity1 , who topped the league in 2013 for the first time for 81 years , ended the regular season as the form team with six wins and a draw from their last seven matches , including a nailbiting triumph over leaders @entity55 last friday			2
it meant they finished level on points with @entity0 , although with an inferior points difference			2
however , the @entity1 have a woeful record in play - off rugby , with nine defeats from 11 ties so far , including one to @entity0 in the 2013 play - offs at the @entity66			1
' we were disappointed what we dished up last year but it 's a new squad , it 's a new season and we 've been able to put a lot of things right that we maybe did wrong last year , ' said @entity1 's @entity73 forward @entity26			1
' we 're looking forward to it			0
it 's play - off time and everyone gets excited at this time of year			2
this is what we 've played all year for and it 's the time to shine			0
' it 's nice to have a bit of form and we 've certainly some confidence from last week			0
it was a must - win game and we came through the first test			0
@entity23 knows his @entity0 side are in for a stiff test against @entity1 on thursday night ' we 're battle hardened and i think we 're ready for play - off football			1
' i think it 's the norm now at @entity1 , we 're expected to be in the play - offs			1
i think we 've crept under the radar this year but we 've knocked off some decent teams			0
' while @entity0 are virtually at full - strength , @entity1 are still without their inspirational captain @entity96 , who has failed to recover from a groin injury sustained in the win over @entity99 a fortnight ago			1
however , @entity26 , who shares the responsibility of captaincy with @entity102 in the absence of @entity96 , believes the win over @entity105 demonstrated that the @entity1 are no one - man team			1
' we do n't believe it in house but everyone keeps telling us we ca n't win a game without @entity96 and that @entity1 are nothing without @entity96 , ' @entity26 said			2
' but i think the younger lads and people who have stepped up to play in the halves have certainly proved that we can play without @entity96 and we can beat a very good side without @entity96			0
' @entity7 has the services of full - back or stand - off @entity117 , who missed the last match with a groin injury , but @entity26 will have every confidence in teenager @entity121 if he is asked to once more take on a playmaking role			1
@entity26 said : ' he 's been a very good player for a couple of seasons in the academy and he 's gradually worked his way into the first team			0
' he 's had a couple of shots now and proved what a good player he is			0
he 's one of the most talented and gifted lads you 'll see playing			0
' he 's got an unbelievable skill set and now it 's just about maturing and kicking on			0

the @entity1 are hopeful of pulling off another shock on thursday night
