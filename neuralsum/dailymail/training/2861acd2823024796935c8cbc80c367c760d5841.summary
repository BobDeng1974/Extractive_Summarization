@entity0 's has shed light on its food production techniques after answering some of the more uncomfortable ' frequently asked questions ' the company faces about its ingredients and processing methods			1
the fast food giant has provided answers on its @entity10 website to a range of queries concerning the quality and content of its food , including whether ' pink slime ' was used in its burgers			1
the company , which has often been criticised for its food sourcing and processing methods , has also addressed such issues as whether its @entity23 is made using the same plastics as yoga mats and what the ingredients are in @entity28			1
' it goes on to say : ' there are no preservatives , no fillers , no extenders and no so - called " pink - slime " in our beef			1
' the only thing added to our burgers is a bit of salt and pepper during grilling			2
' in response to a direct question of whether it uses ' pink - slime ' in its burgers , @entity0 's @entity58 says : ' lean finely textured beef treated with ammonia , what some individuals call “ pink slime " or select lean beef trimmings , is not used in our burgers			1
any recent reports that it is are false			0
' however , it goes on to say : ' @entity58 had begun the process of removing it from our supply chain prior to widespread media coverage on its use and it was completely removed from our supply in 2011			0
' while select lean beef trimmings are safe , we decided to stop using the product to align our global standards for beef around the world			0
' the restaurant chain has also answered questions about the ingredients used in its @entity28 , and why they include an ' anti-foaming ' agent the company has also addressed whether its @entity23 is made using the same plastics as yoga mats elsewhere , the company attempts to explain the difference between the azodicarbonamide used in yoga mats and the variation of the chemical compound which is found in its @entity23			1
it says while the ingredient can be found in bread and other items including hot dogs and hamburger buns , a ' variation of this ingredient ' is also used in some non-food products , including yoga mats			2
it goes on to say it is ' simply not true ' however to claim @entity0 's food ' contains that same rubber or plastics '			1
the company says : ' we recognize the difference between using ingredients in food versus using a variation of those ingredients for non-food purposes can be confusing			1
' we also realize that sometimes the scientific name for an ingredient may sound scary			0
for example , the salt you use to de-ice a driveway is a variation of the salt you use in the kitchen , however they are both sodium chloride			0
' q : are your hamburgers made @entity132 ? @entity133 : yes			0
our burgers in the @entity10 are made using only 100 % @entity42 - inspected beef			1

q : do you use so - called ' @entity152 ' in your burgers ? @entity133 : lean finely textured beef treated with ammonia , what some individuals call ' pink slime ' or select lean beef trimmings , is not used in our burgers			1
any recent reports that it is are false			0

while select lean beef trimmings are safe , we decided to stop using the product to align our global standards for beef around the world			0
in response to whether its burgers were made using ' real beef ' , @entity133 said in the @entity10 they were made of ' 100 % @entity42 - inspected beef ' q : do you import beef from @entity180 , from clear - cut rainforests ? do you import chicken from @entity182 ? @entity133 : most of our beef we use in our @entity10 restaurants comes from the @entity10 , although we import a small percentage of our 100 % beef from suppliers in @entity190 and @entity191 to supplement our @entity10 purchases			1
these suppliers must also meet @entity0 ’s quality and safety standards and @entity42 regulations			1

q : @entity207 ? @entity133 : @entity0 ’s frying oil contains a small amount of an additive called dimethlypolysiloxane , which helps prevent oil from foaming and spattering in our restaurants			1
all of the ingredients we use , including dimethylpolysiloxane , meet recognized food quality and safety standards			1
because dimethylpolysiloxane is used in some non-food products , like putty , caulks or cosmetics , there have been individuals who have erroneously claimed that these items are also in our food			2

@entity257 is used by bakers to help ensure a consistent texture in each batch of bread they bake			0
it is used in many items on grocery store shelves , like some hot dog and hamburger buns and other bread products you may already purchase			0
because a variation of this ingredient is used in some non-food products , including yoga mats , there have been individuals who have erroneously claimed that our food contains that same rubber or plastics			2
