by @entity0 , @entity1 think of @entity2 and you are not that far away from the blueprint for @entity6 's latest creative talent			1
the pint - sized midfielder who inspired @entity6 to their last two major titles - the @entity10 and @entity11 - had proved a tough man for the @entity14 national side to replace following his retirement in 2000 - until , that is , @entity16 came exploding onto the scene			1
most at home when operating in the space behind two strikers , @entity16 has shot to prominence since coming through the @entity24 youth academy , emerging as an inspirational figure for the yellow and blacks and also for @entity6 's youth sides			1
young gun : @entity6 have high hopes on midfielder @entity16 starring for them at this summer 's @entity10 the next messiah ? @entity2 helped @entity6 win the @entity10 and @entity11 comparisons with the 101 - times capped @entity2 were always likely to happen as his star continued to rise - but some have gone further , with @entity16 even being placed in the same bracket as the best player of his generation			1
' he 's the @entity14 @entity40 , ' @entity6 's two - time @entity10 winner @entity39 once said			1
' he has the same understanding and technique , and he 's a footballer who acts purely on his instincts - just like @entity40			0
' it 's impossible to stop @entity16			0
you just can not play any better than him			0
he just strolls through as if there are no opponents			0
' @entity24 were unable to stop @entity16 either when @entity48 stumped up the full value of his release clause - 37 million euros , a then @entity52 record - last summer			2
@entity16 was lured back home to @entity54 where the prospect of working under @entity56 was cited as one of his main motivations			0
under the @entity59 , he hoped to develop in a similar way @entity40 had at @entity61 , ensuring that not only @entity39 would be drawing those parallels in future			2
an injury picked up in the semi-final of last year 's @entity66 , which ruled him out of the final against @entity48 , also saw him miss the start of the 2013/14 campaign			0
prolific : @entity16 scored 10 goals and created 10 assists in 20 @entity52 starts for @entity48 this season high praise : @entity39 has compared @entity16 to @entity61 and @entity75 star @entity40 since returning in october , though , he quickly made up for lost time			1
in just 20 @entity52 starts , @entity16 netted 10 goals and laid on a further 10			1
he created almost a century of chances for his team - mates , becoming one of the exceptions to @entity56 's rotation policy			0
@entity48 without @entity16 is as unimaginable now as @entity6 without their most resourceful asset			2
his flexibility means he can also play as the ' false nine ' frequently preferred by @entity85 , a position similar to @entity40 's at @entity61			2
the @entity87 is a stage for him to draw yet more favourable comparisons with the four - time world player of the year , but in his head the motivation will not be to become the second @entity40 - but the first and only @entity16 .			0

@entity16 is *expected* to play a *key* role in @entity6 's @entity10 bid
@entity16 has been compared to *ex-international* @entity2
@entity2 helped @entity6 win the @entity10 and @entity11
@entity39 has likened @entity16 to @entity6 's @entity40
@entity16 scored 10 goals and created 10 assists in 20 @entity52 starts for @entity48 this season
