these are the brightly coloured rainbow snails which are already facing extinction , despite having only just been discovered			2
each unique to mountains in @entity4 , the carnivorous creatures live in rock crevices , feeding on tinier snails , insect larvae and some earthworms species			1
but these beautiful animals are now at risk from extinction as their limestone habitat is destroyed by humans			2
one of the brightly coloured rainbow snails which are already facing extinction , despite having only just been discovered they are at risk from extinction as their limestone habitat is destroyed by humans they are among three new species from the genus @entity22 , discovered in north and northeastern @entity4			1
the species show extraordinary endemism , meaning they are unique to a geographical area			2
researchers say this ' one hill one species ' is a very peculiar phenomenon			0
each one of these snails is specific and the only one inhabiting a certain mountain range			0
limestone ecosystems in the world are now diminishing at an alarming rate as they are quarried for the stone , meaning areas like @entity4 are losing biodiversity resources			1
limestone ecosystems in the world are now diminishing at an alarming rate as they are quarried for the stone , meaning areas like @entity4 are losing biodiversity resources teams from @entity46 , @entity47 and the @entity48 , @entity49 , have published research on the brightly coloured molluscs , from the genus @entity22			1
' the three new @entity22 species exhibit distinct morphological characteristics , which make for a great example for evolutionary studies in unstable environments			0
' more than 50 per cent of limestone ecosystems in this region have been or still are being destroyed			0
' this astonishing case of biodiversity persistence gives a valuable reason to put effort in the conservation of this important world ecosystem			0

the creatures are each unique to just one mountain each in @entity4
but they now face extinction as their limestone habitats are quarried
