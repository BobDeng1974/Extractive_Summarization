by @entity0 published : 05:13 est , 2 september 2012 updated : 04:20 est , 4 september 2012 it was early evening and under the lights of the small , artfully shabby garden bar of the @entity6 , troubled @entity3 actress @entity2 was drinking with close friend @entity7			1
‘ @entity2 was on good form that night , ’ said a friend who saw her			1
‘ italked to her and her eyes were clear and she did n’t appear to be under the influence of anything			2
‘ she and @entity7 seemed to be getting on like a house on fire			2
@entity7 kept going behind the bushes to smoke , but @entity2 did n’t go with her			2
driven out : @entity2 was informed of her eviction @entity6 by letter following a dispute over an unpaid £ 29,000 bill reputation : the @entity6 hotel in @entity3 she was charm itself – laughing and joking like she did n’t have a care in the world			1
’ but not long after that night , @entity2 , 26 , was again in the news for the wrong reasons			1
the @entity6 – which has been her home for much of the past decade – told her she was banned from the premises , and details were leaked of her unpaid bill of more than £ 29,000 , including room - service meals , £ 500 on her mini-bar in one night and £ 432 worth of cigarettes over 47 days			1
days later , she was accused of badly damaging a dressing room on the set of her latest film , @entity38 – a biopic of @entity41 ’s relationship with @entity42			1
day job : lohan on the set of @entity38 in @entity46 the quintessential @entity3 wild - child has long been better known for her drug - taking , car - crash relationships and multiple arrests than her acting work			1
yet even by her standards , this latest episode is remarkable			2
throughout its 80 - year history , the @entity6 ’s reputation for hedonism has been matched only by its discretion			1
its celebrity guests know their sordid secrets – from trysts in lifts to drug overdoses – will remain within its turreted walls			2
every hellraising celebrity has stayed there , from @entity66 to @entity67 and @entity68			2
none has ever been thrown out , until now			0
‘ @entity2 has been pretty much living at the @entity6 for years , and during her worst periods , when she was taking a lot of drugs , they always took care of her , ’ says a source			0
‘ for her failure to pay this bill to have been made public shows that eventhe place she considers her home just ca n’t take any more of her			1
’ as a child , @entity2 ’s red hair and green eyes and natural comic timing earned her roles in hit films @entity88 , @entity89 and teen classic @entity87			0
by the age of 18 , she had netted a £ 20 million fortune			1
but over the past few years , her drug and alcohol addictions have destroyed a promising career			0
letter : an extract from the letter to @entity2 from the hotel asking her to leave her repeated attempts to revive her film career have been thwarted by her inability to change her lifestyle , which has led to three attempts at rehab , along with three stints in jail for driving under the influence of narcotics and , later , breaking the terms of her probation			1
last year , she pleaded guilty to the theft of a £ 1,500 necklace and was sentenced to 120 days in jail , which she served under house arrest			1
a friend says : ‘ @entity2 is genuinely trying to get back into her career , but @entity2 being @entity2 , controversy just naturally finds her			0
‘ she ’s a @entity121 character			0
there ’s the lovely @entity2 who is a charming and thoughtful friend , but she changes entirely when she ’s taken something or drunk too much			0
she surrounds herself with lackeys and hangers - on who sponge off her and do n’t give her good advice			2
’ @entity2 ’s part of @entity41 in @entity38 was seen as a major step towards salvaging her ailing reputation and proving she still has talent , but during filming in june , an ambulance was called to the @entity134 where she was found ‘ unresponsive ’ in her room			0
her mother @entity136 claimed no drugs were involved , saying : ‘ she was just exhausted			0
’ her unreliability means most major film studios will not hire her because the cost of insurance is prohibitive			0
‘ it would be hard to think of a person more hated by @entity3 than @entity2 , ’ one insider told @entity144			1
the only work she can get is low budget and often low - rent			2
she is filming @entity150 , in which she has a topless sex scene with @entity152 , a porn actor , and last year she posed naked for @entity153			0
following her banning from @entity6 , @entity2 said she assumed the producers of @entity38 were covering the expenses			0
the hotel ’s management denied that a member of staff leaked the bill , saying copies were given to the media by one of @entity2 ’s team			1
they added : ‘ we are as horrified , disappointed and troubled by this occurrence as miss @entity2 surely is			0
’ by thursday evening , there was little sign of the incident preying on @entity2 ’s mind as she partied until the small hours with socialite @entity172 in the vip area of @entity176 nightclub @entity174			0
it looked very much like business as usual .			0
