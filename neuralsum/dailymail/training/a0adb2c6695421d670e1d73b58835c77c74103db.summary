a bitter war of words broke out today over @entity3 's plan to cap the number of immigrants moving to @entity6 from @entity7			1
@entity9 president @entity8 said it was ' quite clear ' that restrictions on foreign workers would be illegal under @entity14 law and said the matter was not up for negotiation			1
@entity18 chairman @entity17 reacted furiously to mr @entity8 ’s remarks			1
he said : ‘ it ’s extraordinary for an unelected bureaucrat to dismiss @entity6 , which will be the second largest economy in @entity7 next year			1
i think he is out of touch with the main stream public opinion in @entity6			1
plans are being drawn up to slash @entity14 migration by imposing an annual cap on the number of national insurance numbers given to immigrants , it was reported this morning			1
under mr @entity3 's proposal migrants would only get national insurance number for a limited time – meaning they would find it harder to move to @entity6 permanently and claim benefits			1
currently anyone from the @entity14 can move to @entity6 and apply for a national insurance number			1
cabinet sources told @entity52 the cap will be a centrepiece of mr @entity3 's planned speech announcing his ' red lines ' for immigration reform as the price of @entity6 staying in the @entity14			1
mr @entity3 wants to set the cap to ensure net migration falls below 100,000 a year – the pledge he made at the last election			0
net migration hit 243,000 in the year to march			0
but mr @entity8 – the outgoing @entity14 commission president – dismissed the proposal out of hand this morning			1
mr @entity8 said it was a ' clear ' principle within the @entity14 that everyone had the right to move for work @entity70 leader @entity69 said mr @entity8 had made it ' crystal clear ' that leaving the @entity14 was the only way to get full control over immigration speaking on the @entity78 's @entity77 show he said : ' any kind of arbitrary cap seems to me to be not in conformity with @entity7 rules because for us it 's very important the principle of non-discrimination			1
' the freedom of movement is a very important principle in the internal market , the movement of goods , of capital , of services and of people			1
' he said the fundamental importance of free movement was ' quite clear '			1
' in principle arbitrary caps seem to me in contradiction with @entity14 rules			1
that 's quite clear from my point of view			0
' mr @entity8 criticised mr @entity106 for saying the @entity6 was ' lighting a fire ' beneath the @entity14 through the @entity109 ' plans for an @entity14 referendum			1
' i am told that the foreign secretary was before the minister of defence and i think this reference to fire and weapons is more appropriate for defence than a foreign secretary			2
' it 's very important to have a positive tone regarding these issues between @entity6 and the @entity14			1
' @entity3 is working on plans to cap @entity14 migration but mr @entity17 dismissed the @entity14 remarks			1
he said : ‘ @entity8 ’s only the latest person from @entity7 to tell us we ’ll never get what we want			2
‘ but remember , we were never going to get the rebate that @entity128 successfully got - we were never going to get to pull back powers but we ’ve done that for a whole lot of competences ; we were never going to get a cut in the @entity14 budget , people said that was impossible , but @entity3 ’s negotiated that			2
there are lots of impossible things that we ’ve managed to do in @entity7			0
” mr @entity17 confirmed the prime minister would be setting out the conservative plans to cut immigration in coming weeks			2
it comes after the @entity139 launched a fresh effort to try to persuade would - be @entity70 voters to back the @entity109 , warning that it would be a ' terrible irony ' if voting for @entity69 's party let @entity147 take the keys to no 10			0
the prime minister said voters should not be ' deceived ' into thinking that it was anything other than a ' stark choice ' between the conservatives and @entity152 at the next election			0
next may 's general election would be ' the most important for a generation ' , the prime minister said in an article for the @entity157 , telling voters it would be a straight contest between him and mr @entity147 to run the country			0
in a message to wavering @entity109 , he said : ' let no - one deceive you that there is a third way			0
a vote for @entity70 is a vote for @entity152			0
' that much was proved in the recent by - elections			0
in @entity168 , previously a conservative seat , @entity70 won			0
in @entity169 and @entity170 , @entity152 held their seat			0
' and to those considering voting for @entity70 on the issues of immigration and @entity7 , i would point you to our conservative record			0
' non-eu migration is now at its lowest levels since the 1990s - and we are committed to putting @entity14 migration right at the heart of our negotiations in @entity7			2
' that comes from the first @entity6 prime minister ever to veto an @entity186 , get the @entity7 budget cut , and pull us out of the bail - out schemes that @entity152 signed us up to			2
' we have also pledged to scrap @entity152 's @entity189 , ending the era of farcical human rights rulings handed down from @entity7			0
and never forget : it is only the @entity18 that is offering you that in - out referendum on @entity7 in 2017			2
' there would be a terrible irony if people who care about these issues voted @entity70 - making a @entity199 more likely			0
' the prime minister warned that letting mr @entity201 into @entity202 would result in a ' great nation slipping back into decline ' , with households facing rising mortgage bills and jobs being moved overseas			0
he said : ' a @entity208 hardly bears thinking about			0
imagine : the international markets wincing as the @entity6 government racks up more debt ; interest rates and mortgage rates going up ; businesses crushed under punishing taxes ; jobs leaving our shores ; the unions back in @entity220 ; diktats and bureaucratic schemes raining down on our schools and hospitals ; the sense of a great nation slipping back into decline			2
' @entity229 immigration minister @entity228 said : ' why should anyone believe the prime minister when he has a record of making big promises on immigration and not delivering , when everyone knows he wants headlines for the @entity237 and @entity238 by - election , and when the briefing from the government keeps changing every couple of days ? '			0

@entity8 said free movement was a ' fundamental principle '
@entity9 president said ' arbitrary caps ' were against @entity14 law
also *rebuked* @entity106 over boast @entity6 was ' lighting a fire ' under @entity14
@entity18 chairman @entity17 dismisses @entity8 as ' unelected bureaucrat '
he says it was ' extraordinary ' for @entity14 to ' dismiss ' concerns over @entity6
