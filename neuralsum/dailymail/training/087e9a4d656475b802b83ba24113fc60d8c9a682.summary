the biggest strike for five years will cause huge disruption to schools , courts and travel tomorrow in the most serious industrial challenge to the coalition since it was formed			1
hundreds of thousands of teachers , lecturers , civil servants and other workers will walk out for 24 hours in protest at controversial plans to change their pensions , cut jobs and freeze pay			1
all police leave in the capital has been cancelled as the force seeks to control a huge protest march as well as walkouts by civilian staff at @entity21			1
the strike will cause delays to people arriving at airports			1
managers have been trained to step in to conduct airport passport checks amid staff shortages ( file picture ) the co-ordinated union action is also set to hit up to 15,000 schools , affecting seven million children extra officers are being parachuted in to man 999 call centres with fears that a minority of activists may attempt to hijack the march for their own purposes			1
the first effects of the strike action will be felt tonight , before the official time of 12.01 , with staff at the @entity45 set to walkout early due to varying shift patterns			1
that will cause huge problems for passengers at @entity51 and @entity52 airports , which are warning passengers of long delays at passport control			2
' as far as we are concerned the strike officially starts at 12.01 but the effects of it may be felt earlier , ' said a @entity45 spokesman			1
tomorrow , @entity61 will be closed , as will the roads around the @entity63 , with police fearing ' @entity66 - style ' protest outside @entity67			1
security inside @entity67 is also going to be stepped up			2
@entity69 , leader of the @entity70 , said it was the most important strike in his union 's history , adding : ' everything we have ever worked for is under attack			1
' schools : up to 15,000 will close airports and seaports : severe delays expected courts : urgent cases will be heard but trials may be postponed job centres : @entity85 will be paid automatically with no signing on universities : 350 colleges and 75 universities to close or partially shut @entity90 : skeleton staff driving tests : licenses and tax discs should be applied for online coastguard : expected to continue as usual fire service : no strike but most staff are against increasing retirement from 55 to 61			1
the prime minister launched a fresh attack on the strike , while business leaders warned it will have a ' significant impact ' on industry			1
@entity108 told @entity109 there was no case for industrial action and repeated that the proposed changes to public sector pensions were ' fair '			1
speaking at @entity101 's question time , he said he hoped ' as many mums and dads as possible ' would be able to take their children to school despite the action			1
' i do n't believe there is any case for industrial action tomorrow , not least because talks are still ongoing			1
' it is only a minority of unions who have taken the decision to go ahead and strike			1
' what we are proposing is fair			0
it is fair to taxpayers but it is also fair to the public sector because we want to continue strong public sector pensions			0
' he also attacked @entity140 leader @entity139 , who did not ask about the walkout , accusing him of being ' in the pocket of the unions '			0
the @entity145 said disruption will lead to many parents having to take the day off work to look after their children , losing them pay and hitting productivity			0
@entity150 of law firm @entity151 warned that workers could face disciplinary action if they take time off to look after their children			1
mr @entity108 today echoed his feeling that the strikes were wrong at a time when negotiations were ongoing he said : ' anyone thinking of phoning into the office tomorrow and claiming absence on the grounds of a parental emergency could find themselves in hot water			0
' whilst parents are entitled to unpaid time off to arrange childcare due to sickness or some other such unpredictable event , these strikes have been known about for months			0
' employers could argue that this situation does not qualify as an emergency and take disciplinary action against individuals who do n't turn up for work			1
' picket lines will be mounted outside school gates , courts , jobcentres , @entity67 , driving test centres and government buildings by members of the @entity184 ( @entity184 ) , @entity185 ( @entity185 ) , @entity186 , and @entity70 negotiators : @entity188 of the @entity190 union and @entity69 of @entity70 who warned of a security risk education secretary @entity192 has said that teachers wanting to strike could be forced to tell head teachers if they intend to strike			1
many schools will close - up to 15,000 - because they do n't know if they will have enough staff to provide adequate supervision			0
schools are not allowed to close ' in sympathy ' with strike action , but may be forced to as a result of the staff shortages			1
mr @entity192 told the @entity203 that these rules would be reviewed as he urged schools to stay open with @entity206 checked parent volunteers			0
he said : ' i would far rather see schools stay open and offer a restricted curriculum than see hard - working families have to lose a day 's pay themselves or have to pay for ad hoc and expensive last - minute childcare			0
' he added that it was ' regrettable ' that two of the teaching unions were planning strike action which was ' unnecessary while talks were still going on '			1
' it will cause massive inconvenience to hard - working families and it will hit working women particularly hard , ' he said			0
mr @entity192 has also written to head teachers asking them to keep schools open warning that strikes ' wo n't improve the prestige of the profession ' an a column for @entity229 today			0
he concluded : ' this government wo n't allow strike action to derail our drive for a better future for our children			1
' labour leader @entity139 said : ' i understand why teachers are so angry with the government			0
' but i urge them to think about whether causing disruption in the classroom will help people understand their arguments			2
' business secretary @entity244 said he believed the public would find it difficult to understand why the strike was going ahead when negotiations over pensions were continuing			2
it was ' imperative ' that public sector pensions were reformed , said dr cable , adding that he intended to be in his office tomorrow and hoped that if any @entity256 staff went on strike it would not ' spoil ' the working relationship			2
@entity259 , policy chairman of the @entity260 , said : ' small firms are concerned about the impact that the proposed strike action will have on their ability to do business on thursday			1
' the recovery remains in a fragile state and this action will have a wider impact on the economy as businesses lose productivity - something the economy simply can not afford			2
' airports have warned travellers to expect disruption on arrival into the @entity279 as immigration and customs officers join the strike			2
passengers have been advised to consider travelling on a different day to avoid delays as hundreds of staff walk out			0
a spokeswoman for @entity287 said : ' @entity287 is working closely with the @entity288 to support their contingency planning and minimise disruption to our customers			0
' we will keep our passengers informed of the situation through text messages , advice at check - in and onboard announcements			0
' high - speed @entity300 train company @entity299 said it would not be affected by industrial action			2
it added that it was running two extra trains tomorrow - one from @entity304 to @entity305 , the other from @entity305 to @entity304 , to cope with expected extra demand			0
@entity308 , the mayor of @entity304 , has written to headteachers across the capital urging them to keep their schools open			2
' to close would cause considerable inconvenience to working parents who will be forced to make alternative childcare arrangements , ' said the @entity315 , quoting from his letter			0
disappointed : @entity317 , left , and @entity318 said the talks were ' constructive ' but said they were unhappy the strike was going ahead a militant union is ‘ bullying ’ 100,000 school support staff into joining teachers in thursday ’s mass walkout – even though they have not voted to strike			2
education secretary @entity192 has implored schools to remain open by any means possible , utilising an army of mothers and support staff			0
but yesterday it emerged the @entity333 – which is not involved in this round of strikes – is telling its members not to cross the picket line			0
the @entity333 represents some 100,000 non-teaching schools staff , from teaching assistants to dinner ladies , and caretakers to porters			0
it is illegal union members , other than those who have voted in favour of action , to strike			1
however , under guidelines from the @entity349 , non-striking staff are not obliged to cross a picket line			0
meanwhile @entity351 , which represents 200,000 school support staff , has told its members not to cover the jobs of striking teachers			0
their action will make it near - impossible for the majority of schools to remain open			2
' it would also have a considerable impact on those employers in the capital whose employees will need to take leave to care for their children			1
' @entity184 leader @entity369 said : ' the action tomorrow is regrettable but unfortunately , due to the position that the government has taken , unavoidable			2
' teachers have been left with no option but to demonstrate the strength of feeling they have about the unnecessary proposals , which will see teachers paying more , working longer and getting less for their pensions			0
' the @entity380 has confirmed that teachers ' pensions are affordable			0
' @entity383 has said all the evidence demonstrates that the costs of public sector pensions are falling			0
' it is increasingly obvious that the government is pressing ahead with changes on an ideological , not economic , argument			0
' mr @entity69 urged union members to ignore @entity388 calls not to strike , adding : ' thousands of jobs are at stake , lower pensions are set to cost three times as much , and pay is frozen while inflation soars			2
' if you have never taken part in strike action before , make tomorrow 's national action your first			1

all police leave in the capital cancelled
fears that minority of activists may hijack protest march
