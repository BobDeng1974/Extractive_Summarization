a nine - year - old @entity0 predicted he would usurp the world 's greatest golfer after penning a letter to @entity4 back in 1999			1
although the @entity8 legend may have never read the prophecy , a @entity6 profile pieced together its contents through interviews with @entity0 and close family members			0
having just won the 1998 @entity14 in @entity15 for the 10 - 11 age group , the young @entity0 's message was clear : ' i 'm coming to get you			2
' a nine - year - old @entity0 predicted he would catch @entity4 to become the world 's best golfer the @entity23 heads to @entity24 hoping to complete a full set of major titles @entity4 injury problems have seen him slip out of the top 100 for the first time since 1996 when asked if he recalled the letter , the three time major winner sheepishly admitted : ' a lot of those memories have kind of blurred together			1
but , yeah , it went something like that			0
' whether @entity4 , ranked an unassailable no 1 at the time , would have paid much attention is unlikely but 16 years later it 's the @entity23 who heads golf 's rankings - while @entity4 has slipped out of the top 100 for the first time since 1996			1
and , not only has @entity0 surpassed him on the course but he has also taken his former idol 's role as @entity47 's poster boy and the face of @entity50 video game			0
in 1999 , when @entity0 's letter was written , no one could touch @entity4 at the top of golf 's table @entity0 has taken @entity4 ' place on the course and as poster boy for @entity47 and @entity50 meanwhile , @entity0 heads for @entity59 bulked up in bid to complete a career grand slam by winning his third consecutive major title			1
although the 25 - year - old still has a long way to go before surpassing @entity4 ' record of 683 total weeks as world no 1 , he is undoubtedly the @entity8 's successor as golf 's heavyweight star - both on and off the greens			2
and his obsession with the gym is giving the star more than a helping hand			0
' it was when i started to notice results that i fell in love with it , ' said @entity0 @entity0 hits the gym as he prepares for the masters at @entity24 next month			0
