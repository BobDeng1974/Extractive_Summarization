twitter user @ @entity8 _ begged for forgiveness and to be left alone after sending the threatening tweet sunday morning and within minutes receiving a reply from the airline saying her ip address had been forwarded to the @entity15			1
she then pleaded with people to stop harassing her while gaining tens of thousands of followers and claiming she ‘ blocked the @entity15 just in case			1
’ bad idea : the teen immediately regretted sending this ' joke ' bomb threat infamy : the girl claimed all she wanted was to be famous , but lamented finding the wrong kind of fame ‘ hello my name ’s @entity30 and i ’m from @entity32 , ’ @entity29 wrote sunday			1
‘ i ’m part of @entity34 and on june 1st i ’m gon na do something really big bye			2
’ the airline ’s reply was brief and to the point			2
‘ @entity29 , we take these threats very seriously			0
your ip address and details will be forwarded to security and the @entity15			0
’ the girl then pleaded with the airline , saying she ’s only 14 - years - old and from the @entity1 , that she ’s never been to @entity32			2
‘ what do you want from me ? ’ she pleaded			0
it was to no avail , the airline did not reply			0
it was just a joke : the girl insisted she was joking and not from @entity32 , but the airline did not reply worried : the girl expressed her fear and threw her friend under the bus , anything to avoid being in trouble massive following : her followers shot up over 30,000 by sunday night ‘ i ’m so sorry i ’m scared now			1
‘ i was joking and it was my friend not me , take her ip address not mine			0
’ the airline did not reply , but @entity68 users did			1
her followers shot from a couple thousand to over 30,000 by sunday night			1
she took note of the gain in followers			2
‘ i always wanted to be famous			0
but i meant like @entity73 famous , not @entity75 bin laden famous , ’ she tweeted			0
humility : the girl claimed she was too busy flying around in her own jet to blow up a commercial one problem solved : @entity68 deleted and @entity15 ' blocked ' both the @entity4 and @entity29 ’s tweet were eventually deleted , and it is not exactly clear if any call to the @entity15 was ever made			1
‘ we took it down basically because it generated a lot of traffic , ’ spokeswoman @entity84 told the @entity85			0
‘ we took it down so we could better focus on our customers			0
’ @entity68 spokesperson declined to comment on the matter to the @entity93 , but tweeted that ‘ only law enforcement can request private information about @entity68 accounts			1
’ @entity29 expressed remorse for the stunt , wondering aloud why she did it – but the she wrote ‘ i changed my name to @entity30			0

the girl instantly gained 30,000 followers and became the talk of @entity68 sunday morning after the joke started *trending*
