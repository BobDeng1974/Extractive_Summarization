and she has told friends she is prepared to contact lawyers in an effort to get an official apology from @entity23 and the @entity8			1

@entity63 and @entity57 ( left ) toppled out of @entity12 - and judge @entity16 ripped their performance to shreds miss @entity16 , 33 , a former winner of the show , said of the performance : ‘ @entity10 , i think you are a sexy woman and you know how to work it but i have to be honest – you are a walking disaster			1
‘ your legs are so far apart and that ’s not very feminine			0
you both should have stayed in the coffin ! ’ on @entity76 yesterday , miss @entity10 said the show had been left bare without her , adding : ‘ it ’s like a christmas tree without the lights			1
’ and referring to @entity23 , the only female judge on the @entity12 panel , she said : ‘ some of the comments , especially when something comes from a woman to another woman , she has to think about it			1
‘ she was not elegant , she was a little bit vulgar			0
there is a fine line between entertainment and then unnecessary comments			2
’ host @entity93 consoles @entity44 left in tears after her dress breaks during her routine presenter @entity97 then interjected : ‘ @entity16 did say you are very sexy … ’ to which miss @entity10 retorted : ‘ well everyone knows that , it ’s quite evident			1
’ but she admitted : ‘ if you do a show like this you ca n’t take anything personally , you have to take a risk for entertainment			0
’ seemingly joking , she added : ‘ i do n’t think it was personal otherwise they would be having legal action immediately from my lawyers			2

‘ the way she looks is , of course , a massive part of her personality			0
‘ she does n’t mind her dancing being criticised , but she took @entity16 ’s remarks about her legs as a massive slap in the face			1
' she felt it was really nasty to be trashed in front of millions of viewers and she wants an apology – and she ’s talking to lawyers to find out the best way to get one			2
’ the friend added : ‘ @entity57 is also appalled			0

’ miss @entity10 ’s spokesman said last night : ‘ @entity10 is now looking at her options as to how to get an apology from @entity16 and the @entity8			1
’ yesterday @entity34 also hit back at criticism of his routine , writing on @entity146 : ‘ so some people thought it was inappropriate to do a @entity37 move at 7pm on a saturday night to one of his songs ! why ? ’ last night a @entity8 spokesman said : ‘ the judges always look to give constructive criticism and this is often delivered with humour given that @entity12 is an entertainment show			0
