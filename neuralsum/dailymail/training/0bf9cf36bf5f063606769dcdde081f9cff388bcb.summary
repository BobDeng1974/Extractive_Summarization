by @entity0 follow @ @ ralphellis56 @entity0 runs you through what we learned from the weekend 's football			2
this week includes @entity6 's @entity5 making good his promise to play more attacking football , @entity9 doing his best @entity11 impression and @entity12 making a case in defence of @entity15			1
1 ) @entity5 said his @entity17 ’s resolution was to prove he ’s an attacking midfield man – and he ’s true to his word			1
he followed up a goal and an assist at @entity21 by setting up one of @entity23 ’ s double against @entity24 and made three more chances			0
some 76 of the massive total of 106 passes he played in the game were in the opposition ’s half of the field			0
@entity33 power : @entity5 has kept true to his @entity17 's resoultion of playing more attacking football @entity12 makes case for the defence 2 ) converted defender @entity39 and skipper @entity40 have become the rocks on which @entity15 ’s attempt at survival are founded			1
since @entity12 paired them up in front of his back four , the @entity15 have conceded just four goals in six games			1
the security blanket they put in front of the defence meant that of @entity55 ’s 17 attempts on goal , only three of them were from inside the penalty area			1
in fact since @entity12 took charge at @entity59 only @entity6 have kept more clean sheets			1
eyes wide shut : @entity63 ( left ) and @entity39 ( right ) have conceded only four goals in six games 3 ) @entity64 out passed @entity65 with 642 passes against 499 , and had more of the ball in both halves ( 55.3 % and 57.2 % ) , but still got battered 3 - 1			1
sadly that is a recurring theme for @entity71 ’s side who are great to watch but find themselves flirting with relegation just three points out of the drop zone			0
the @entity77 have had more possession and made more passes than their opposition in every one of the 14 games they have failed to win this season			2
9/10s of the law ? @entity64 players dejected after losing to @entity65 - they have had more possession in all 14 games they have lost @entity9 does his best @entity11 impression 4 ) @entity9 is in danger of becoming the new @entity11 of a few years back – whole hearted rather than nasty but still too reckless for the good of himself and whoever he ’s against			1
the @entity96 defender was sent off at @entity55 for a challenge on @entity98 ( although that was rescinded on appeal ) , and then again against @entity101 for a reckless tackle on @entity103			1
that means his tackle that put @entity107 ’s @entity106 on a stretcher was the third serious incident he ’s been involved in , in just 14 games since himself returning from a bad injury			1
liability : @entity106 ( right ) scores before being stretchered off the field after a tackle by @entity9 5 ) @entity21 became the first @entity116 side to wrack up more than 50 bookings this season with four cautions in the game at @entity121			1
manager @entity122 insists it is a result of over enthusiasm from young players rather than any deliberate plan to go out kicking people			0
@entity128 got his loan spell started by collecting one of them , meaning @entity21 have had 52 yellows in all – five more than @entity55			1
@entity133 are third with 44 – of which @entity134 has contributed seven			0
it was all yellow : new signing @entity128 contributed to @entity21 being the first side to tally 50 cautions 6 ) @entity139 ’s @entity138 tucked away two penalties in the 4 - 1 win over @entity142 – but would n’t have made manager @entity143 quite so happy by picking up a booking for a bad foul in the second half			0
it was his tenth of the season in just 26 games – making him along with @entity150 of @entity151 the first to reach the mark that earns a two game suspension			2
the 23 - year - old @entity138 , who started out at @entity6 being tipped for great things , will miss @entity139 ’s @entity156 fourth round tie at home to @entity158 plus a championship match at @entity160			0
take caution : @entity138 ( r ) scored two penalties for @entity139 against @entity142 ... but also picked up his 10th booking this season 7 ) @entity164 might be the next championship manager looking over his shoulder as @entity167 slide into hard times			0
the 1 - 0 defeat at an @entity170 inspired @entity171 was their fourth loss in a row , the worst sequence since just before @entity175 was sacked in october 2012			0
@entity164 ’s side , a point off the play - offs on @entity179 after a 3 - 0 success at @entity181 , have suddenly found themselves down to tenth			2
sack race ? @entity164 's @entity167 lost their fourth consecutive game after defeat against @entity171 8 ) @entity185 was in brilliant form for @entity187 as their 1 - 0 win at @entity189 put them five points clear at the top of the @entity192			0
that ’s all the more reason to wonder why the owners at the @entity195 have n’t done anything about securing the 27 - year - old son of the great @entity198 on a new contract			0
his current deal runs out in the summer , and @entity6 , @entity202 and @entity203 are among current @entity116 clubs who fancy signing him on a free transfer			0
fumble ? @entity187 have not offered @entity185 a new deal despite his heroics this season 9 ) @entity210 finally got a striker scoring goals yesterday , and the @entity214 manager must have been all the more glad about @entity216 hat - trick after @entity218 ’s on - loan exploits all season			2
as if his performances for @entity221 had n’t been embarrassment enough , he has another front man getting goals for another club			2
@entity227 under 21 star @entity226 had already got 18 in 37 games for @entity229 – then he marked his first start for @entity231 by scoring the winner against @entity233			0
loan star : with 18 goals in 37 games , @entity226 ( c ) is another @entity214 loanee doing well away from @entity238 10 ) things might be tough for @entity240 at @entity241 , but just down the @entity244 his old number two @entity242 is having a better time of it			2
@entity9 can look forward seeing @entity203 arrive at @entity247 in the @entity156 next week in confident mood after a 3 - 0 win over @entity250 , which took his @entity252 team to just one defeat in their last 15 games			1
the man who first got @entity203 into the @entity116 – and kept them there for a season – has moved the @entity258 within a point of the automatic promotion places in @entity261			0
@entity263 boots : @entity252 manager @entity9 has only tasted one defeat in 15 games			1

@entity5 makes good on @entity268 resolution to play more attacking football
@entity9 was involved in his third serious incident after @entity55 red card
@entity15 have only conceded four goals in six games after @entity12 ' arrival
