global warming could be triggering increasingly cold winters in some parts of the world , scientists have claimed			1
researchers have discovered a link between rising ocean temperatures , and a large pocket of cold air known as the polar vortex			1
they discovered that as oceans heat up and melt the @entity14 ice , warm air is released that destabilises polar air and sends cold blasts into the atmosphere			1
researchers claim the most recent polar vortex ( illustrated ) was caused by melting polar ice , which was melted by warmer ocean temperatures			1
this caused warm air to destabilise the polar air and send cold air into the atmosphere			1
and as global warming continues to heats oceans , freezing winters could increase the polar vortex was responsible for the extreme and freezing temperatures experienced in the @entity31 last winter			1
a polar vortex is a large pocket of very cold air that sits above the polar region during the winter months			1
during winter this air chills and contrasts with the warmer temperatures further away from the pole			0
a polar vortex is a large pocket of very cold air that sits above the polar region during the winter season			1
during winter , this air gets cold , and contrasts with the temperatures further away from the pole			2
pressure contrasts between these temperatures create fast winds that swirl around the pocket of cold air			2
the polar vortex is weakest during summer , because there is less of a contrast between temperatures			2
pressure contrasts between these temperatures create fast winds that swirl around the pocket of cold air			2
researchers , led by @entity56 from @entity57 , compared recent weather trends and reports , with computer models			0
the modelling was designed to reveal what @entity62 would look like if it had n’t experienced any @entity14 ice loss			0
they discovered that the polar ice is melting because warmer water is travelling up the @entity68 from tropical regions of the @entity70 towards @entity71 and other areas of @entity73			2
in particular , the water is causing ‘ exceptional sea ice melt ' in the @entity78 - @entity77 seas			0
this melting leads to areas of open water , which release heat into the atmosphere during winter months			2
in turn they found this causes the northern jet stream to weaken and move further south , taking cold , polar air with it			2
the warmer temperatures cause the colder , polar temperatures to destabilise and emit cold blasts into the atmosphere			1
due to its location , @entity96 and the @entity31 in particular , faced the brunt of this cold air in more recent winters			1
but @entity100 is likely to also see the cooling effect impacting on winters			0
the polar vortex ( illustrated ) was blamed for extreme and freezing temperatures in the @entity31 this winter			1
it is a large pocket of cold air that sits above the polar region			1
during winter , this air gets cold , and contrasts with temperatures further away			0
pressure contrasts between these temperatures to create fast winds researchers , led by @entity56 from @entity57 , compared statistical analysis of recent weather trends , including freezing temperatures in the midwest of the @entity31 ( pictured ) , with computer modelling			1
the modelling was designed to see what @entity62 would look like if it had n’t experienced @entity14 ice loss and , if global warming continues to raise ocean temperatures , the chances of more extreme winter weather will increase , claim the researchers			1
the study was published in the journal @entity128			0
earlier this year global warming was blamed for the ‘ irreversible retreat ’ of west @entity132 glaciers			0
but scientists recently claimed that warming of the planet is in fact behind a paradoxical growth in @entity139 sea ice			0
they believe the shift is caused by water melting from beneath the @entity132 ice shelves and re-freezing back on the surface			0
earlier this week , reports even claimed sea ice cover in the @entity132 is now at its highest level since records began			0
this graphic shows trends in sea ice duration between 1979 and 2010			0
it shows large regional variations			0
rather than disproving global warming , some scientists claim that a recent growth in sea ice may in fact be caused by westerly winds , created by an increase in greenhouse gases satellite images revealed 7.7 million square miles ( 20 million sq km ) of ice surrounding the continent			1
but rather than disproving global warming , scientists claim that this growth may in fact be caused by it			2
the first theory is that westerly winds , which flow around @entity132 , are speeding up and moving south			0
this is thought to be linked to an increase in greenhouse gases and an increase in sea ice			0
the second theory is that sea ice forms easier due to the colder and fresher melt water from @entity132 's melting glaciers and ice sheets .			0

polar vortex was responsible for freezing temperatures in the @entity31 this winter
it is a large pocket of very cold air that sits over the polar region
study claim the recent vortex may have been caused by melting polar ice
warm water melts the ice , and this causes warm air to be released
warm air destabilises polar air , sending cold blasts into the atmosphere
as global warming continues to heats oceans , freezing winters will increase
