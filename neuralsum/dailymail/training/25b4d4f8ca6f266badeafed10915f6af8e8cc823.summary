@entity0 is enjoying his new role as director of football at @entity4 ' i always used to say to the kids at the academy '' everyone leaves @entity9 at some stage in their life , just try and stay here as long as you can ''			1
i had n't anticipated applying it to myself			2
' @entity0 had been at @entity9 , on and off , for 20 years			1
he was the man who pushed to sign @entity17			2
he had been their chief scout under @entity20 and director of their academy then , a year ago , chief executive @entity18 broke the news the club had decided to move in another direction			1
now director of football at @entity28 side @entity4 , the pain has subsided sufficiently for him to reflect on the moment more philosophically			1
' football clubs do n't stand still , there 's always change and you ca n't always control it , ' he reasons			2
' i 'm a @entity9 fan so it hurt , i loved every day i went to work there , made some great friends and we had a great family atmosphere around the place			1
i 've got great affection for the club and i keep in touch with @entity43 , @entity18 , @entity17 and @entity44			2
although i left , they still treated me with the utmost respect and as they say , when one door closes another opens			0
' @entity49 went on holiday to @entity51 for five days to contemplate his future			1
it rained for four of them			0
' i was miserable , then out of the blue i got a call from @entity57 , the owner of @entity4 , who said he wanted to meet for dinner with @entity59 and the director of football @entity60 to discuss a few ideas			1
i 'd had an offer from @entity64 and one from @entity66 but i was intrigued			0
' by the time dinner came round though , @entity59 had informed @entity4 that he wanted to take the manager 's job at @entity70 and @entity57 did not stand in the @entity72 's way			1
@entity49 works with manager @entity60 and coach @entity73 @entity49 was asked to take @entity60 's role as director of football and @entity60 become manager			1
@entity49 agreed , even offering to walk away at the end of the season if it did n't work out			1
@entity4 were fourth when @entity49 joined and started with a 1 - 0 win at @entity80 , secured in the 93rd minute			1
the next stage was the appointment of coach @entity73 , the @entity83 and @entity84 captain , who had had a brief spell managing @entity86			0
' @entity87 's a great coach with good ideas and he shared our vision			2
he was very unfortunate at @entity86 but he showed there the style he wanted to play and that was similar to what @entity60 and myself wanted			0
' @entity73 and @entity49 moved in together , sharing an apartment in @entity98 ; ' we were like the @entity100 , ' says @entity49			1
' one staunch @entity101 , one staunch @entity9			1
it was an interesting experience			0
' @entity49 enjoys night matches at @entity104 and is looking forward to friday 's derby with @entity106 five months later they clinched promotion to the @entity28 for the first time in 21 years and , going into friday 's derby with west @entity111 rivals @entity106 , sit sixth in the table			1
although managers such as @entity114 contend they could not work with a director of football , @entity49 has faith in @entity4 's system			1
' the whole experience has been a breath of fresh air , ' says @entity49			2
' we have a really open relationship			0
@entity57 , the owner , believes that everyone should be able to say what they think to each other and we do			0
' it ca n't work if , as is the case at some clubs , the manager does n't agree on the players you sign or a committee decides			0
we all have to agree and if one of us does n't then we do n't do it			0
@entity49 is the impressed with @entity4 owner @entity57 and his vision for the club ' @entity60 is one of the hardest workers i 've come across			1
he 's always the first one in and last one out and he lives nearly a two hour drive away , you know what @entity111 traffic is like ! @entity87 likes to try and beat him in of a morning but even when he 's got there at 7am , ' @entity145 ' is in with a coffee on the go			0
' @entity60 is a visionary			0
he gives the players such confidence , he does n't blame them , he does n't lambast them over mistakes			0
there 's a structure to what he does and the football is attractive			2
' that is only fitting as legend has it football began in @entity4 when @entity160 kicked the skull of a vanquished @entity162 across the @entity163 in 54 bc. @entity4 have had an excellent start to the season and are in the top six of the championship ' a couple of old guys came up to me recently and said this was the best football they had seen here , ' says @entity49			1
' i do n't think they were around for @entity160 's debut but they 'd been coming here for 60 years			2
' however , @entity104 , @entity4 's home since 1904 , will not be for much longer			2
@entity57 has a new stadium schemed for nearby @entity178 in 2017/18			0
' @entity57 made a bold decision , ' says @entity49			1
' it would have been cheaper to move farther away but he found the site at @entity178 and it 's important for the fans to keep that identity with the area			0
i 'll be sorry to leave @entity104 though because on a night game , like the one coming up on friday , we 'll have a cracking atmosphere and the place will be rocking			0
' the plan is keep building and nurturing to give the fans something to shout about when we move too			0
we 're all dreaming of going up , it might not be realistic just yet but , as i 've found out , you just never know what 's round the corner			0
