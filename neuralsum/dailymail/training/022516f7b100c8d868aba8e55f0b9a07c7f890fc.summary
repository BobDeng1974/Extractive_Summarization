a solar system including five @entity2 - sized planets has been discovered , which is so ancient , it was born not long after the dawn of time			1
the system 's parent star , named @entity7 , is 117 light years from @entity2 and 11.2 billion years old			1
when the sun - like star was formed out of a primordial cloud of gas and dust , the universe was just a fifth of its current age			1
a solar system including five @entity2 - sized planets has been discovered , which is so ancient , it was born not long after the dawn of time			1
this artist 's impression shows @entity19 , 17 light years from @entity2			1
its planets ( also shown ) were detected from the dimming that occurs when they transit the disc of their parent star the star was originally dubbed @entity28 , but has just been re-named			1
astronomers have shown that it hosts five planets with diameters ranging between those of @entity34 and @entity35			0
that makes them roughly the same size , or slightly smaller than @entity2			2
‘ there are far - reaching implications for this discovery , ’ said dr @entity38 , from the @entity40 's @entity39			2
‘ we now know that @entity2 - sized planets have formed throughout most of the universe 's 13.8 billion year history , which could provide scope for the existence of ancient life in the @entity51			1
‘ by the time the @entity2 formed , the planets in this system were already older than our planet is today			1
the planet hunter strikes again : astronomers made the discovery after trawling through four years ' worth of data collected by @entity60 ’s @entity59 ( illustrated ) astronomers made the discovery after trawling through four years ' worth of data collected by @entity60 ’s kepler space telescope			0
dr @entity38 's team conducted the research using a technique called asteroseismology , which involves ‘ listening ’ to vibrations caused by sound trapped within a star			2
the oscillations led to tiny pulse - like changes in brightness , which allowed the researchers to measure the star 's diameter , mass and age			1
the planets were detected from the dimming that occurred when they passed across the face of the star			2
by measuring the minute fading of light coming from the star the scientists were able to calculate the relative size of the planets			1
‘ this discovery may now help to pinpoint the beginning of what we might call the “ era of planet formation			0
” ’ he said in a talk earlier this year : ' @entity2 - size planets may have readily formed at earlier epochs in the universe 's history when metals were more scarce			1
' however , the chances of an advanced race of beings living on any of the planets are remote , despite @entity19 being 25 per cent smaller and 700 degrees cooler than the sun. each of the worlds is so close to its star that its year - the time taken to complete one orbit of the star - is less than 10 days long			1
at that distance , the planets would be much hotter than @entity34 and unable to support @entity2 - like life			1
the system 's innermost planet is the size of @entity34 , the middle three are the size of @entity125 , and the outermost is slightly smaller than @entity35			2
the scientists found an ancient planetary system containing five planets ( shown at the bottom of the illustration , compared to other planets at the top )			2
the system 's innermost planet is the size of @entity34 , the middle three are the size of @entity125 , and the outermost is slightly smaller than @entity35 the @entity137 questions why have we not found aliens , despite the existence of hundreds of billions of exosolar systems in our galactic neighborhood in which life might evolve			1
physicist @entity145 devised it in @entity148 believed it was too extraordinary that not a single extraterrestrial signal or engineering project has yet been detected			0
he claimed there must be some kind of barrier that prevents the rise of intelligent , self - aware , technologically advanced , space - colonising civilisations			0
this barrier is sometimes referred to as a ' @entity158 '			0
the absence could be caused because either intelligent life is extremely rare or intelligent life has a tendency to go extinct			0

professor @entity194 , who co-authored the study , said : ‘ the first discoveries of exoplanets around other sun - like stars in our galaxy have fuelled efforts to find other worlds like @entity2 and other terrestrial planets outside our solar system			1
' we are now getting first glimpses of the variety of galactic environments conducive to the formation of these small worlds			0
@entity19 , which is 11.2 billion years old , is a quarter of the @entity214 's size but bright enough to be seen with binoculars in the constellation @entity217 ( illustrated ) ‘ as a result , the path towards a more complete understanding of early planet formation in the galaxy is now unfolding before us			1

professor @entity225 , a member of the team from @entity227 , said : ‘ this is one of the oldest systems in the galaxy			0
‘ @entity19 came from the first generation of stars			0
this system tells us that planets were forming nearly seven billion years before our own @entity235			2
‘ planetary systems around stars have been a common feature of our galaxy for a long , long time			0
’ @entity59 is a space observatory launched by @entity60 in 2009 to discover @entity2 - like planets orbiting other stars			1
it 's designed to survey our region of the @entity245 in a bid to discover @entity2 - size exoplanets			1
it works by detecting regular variations in brightness of stars , which are caused by orbiting exoplanets passing in front of them			0
so far , the observatory has found 1,013 confirmed exoplanets in 440 systems as well as 3,199 possible planets			0
in november last year , astronomers said there could be as many as 40 billion @entity2 - sized planets orbiting in habitable zones within the @entity245 , based on the data collected so far			1
@entity59 was originally built to last three - and - a - half years , and since then , experts have worked to extend its life			2
but in august 2013 , @entity60 announced it had given up trying to fix two failed reaction wheels , meaning that the mission had to be modified			0
the ' @entity270 ' was announced in may last year , meaning that the partially paralysed observatory will detect habitable planets around smaller and dimmer dwarf stars			0
last month , @entity60 announced that @entity59 had found its 1000th confirmed exoplanet .			0

solar system 's parent star , named @entity7 , is 117 light years from @entity2
11.2 billion - year - old star formed when the universe was a fifth of its age
five @entity2 - sized planets orbit the star with years *equivalent* to 10 days
scientists say the hot planets are unable to support human - like life
find shows @entity2 - sized planets have formed throughout universe 's history
