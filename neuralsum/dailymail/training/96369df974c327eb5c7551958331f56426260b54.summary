by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 20:53 est , 22 january 2013 updated : 08:34 est , 23 january 2013 forty per cent of girls born in the @entity4 this year will become centenarians , experts say			1
this is up 13 per cent of girls born in 1951 who are expected to reach this milestone , and scientists say there is no sign the trend will end any time soon			1
by 2060 they estimate there will be around half a million centenarians living in @entity4 , and 60 per cent of girls born that year can be expected to receive a birthday card from the monarch			1
@entity19 , chief economist at the @entity20 think tank , revealed the predictions in an article published in the @entity24			2
sweet dreams : @entity26 was born in @entity27 yesterday			2
she , like the 400,000 other girls expected to be born in the @entity4 this year , has a 40 % chance of reaching 100 he said the rise in life expectancy revealed by the @entity33 mirrors worldwide trends , apart from notable exceptions including @entity36 and the @entity37			1
he attributed it to the fact that people are dying at older ages as they are more likely to survive childhood thanks to better education and improved healthcare			0
the trend has certainly put pressure on @entity48 resources			2
when the tradition of sending a telegram from the monarch to all new centenarians began in 1917 , @entity49 dispatched 24 celebratory messages			0
by 1952 , the number had increased ten-fold and by 2011 it had increased to nearly 10,000			0
this graph reveals life expectancy at birth of @entity4 males and females : the principal projection is the best estimated age based on current trends population survival curves : the red line shows the percentage of women who are expected to survive to ages up to 100			1
the black line is an estimation for girls born in 2060 mr @entity19 warns living longer can bring its own problems , with more years of disability			1
while life expectancy for women has risen by 4.6 per cent since 1990 , healthy life expectancy has risen by only 3 per cent			1
mr @entity19 writes : ‘ living longer is a good thing but not much fun if those extra years are lived in pain and discomfort			2
‘ how healthy humans will be in the future is an open question , but historically at least , previous gains in healthy life expectancy have more to do with reductions in mortality than reductions in years lived in disability			1
’ in @entity94 as a whole , the proportion of people aged over 65 is predicted to hit 40 per cent by 2030			0
@entity95 and old : researchers estimate that 40 per cent of girls born this year will become centenarians mr @entity19 questions whether the world can support ageing populations			1
he writes : ‘ is there a cloud to this silver lining ? as more and more people live to older ages what will happen to the world ’s population ? could we ﬁnd our aged selves scrabbling for resources as the world ’s population explodes ? ’ the economist says this is unlikely because population growth will slow over the coming decades			0
question : @entity19 , chief economist at the @entity20 thinktank , writing in the @entity24 , asks : ' where will it all end ? ' he adds : ‘ as life expectancy improves , people – as we know from the history of industrialised nations – adjust their family to the point where populations in aggregate more or less hit the replacement rate , where births equal deaths			1
so , until the next set of population predictions , no need to panic			0
’ pensions minister @entity139 said earlier this month that rising life expectancy meant a higher retirement age was essential			2
‘ if people are going to live on average to late 80s and beyond , retiring in late 50s is just never going to make the sums add up , ’ he said			0
he suggested further changes were in store for younger generations			0
‘ if someone tells a 30 - year - old what their state pension age is going to be , they are lying , ’ he added			0
large variations remain between men and women and different social groups.one study found a difference of 11.4 years between women in the poorest and most afﬂuent social groups .			0

13 % of girls born in 1951 expected to reach 100 *compared* to 40 % born now
@entity20 @entity19 said trend *due* to continue with no end in sight
however , life expectancy rising *quicker* than healthy life expectancy
