researchers at a prestigious @entity2 research centre have revealed a 17 year contest to slip @entity5 lyrics into scientific papers			1
researchers at the @entity8 in @entity9 say the game started with a paper called ' @entity12 and inflammation : the answer is blowing in the wind '			1
the winner will be the researcher who quotes @entity5 in the most scientific articles before they retire - and will get lunch at a @entity21 restaurant			1
the contest started 17 years ago with a paper called ' @entity12 and inflammation : the answer is blowing in the wind ' the researchers in the game agree on @entity5 's genius			1
@entity30 thinks he merits a @entity31 while @entity32 compares him to a modern @entity33 , though in music			0
but the researchers also draw parallels between @entity5 's music and the world of research			1
' a musician who merely continues down the same highway for 30 years is not one who many want to listen to			0
' good music is innovative , like @entity5 's			1
' and the same thing applies to good research			0
' a researcher must also try to find new and different paths , ' says @entity48			0
@entity49 and @entity30 , today both professors at the @entity51 at @entity8 , bean the game when they had an article published in @entity54 with the title : ' @entity12 and inflammation : the answer is blowing in the wind '			1
' we both really like @entity5 so when we set about writing an article concerning the measurement of nitric oxide gas in both the respiratory tracts and the intestine , with the purpose of detecting inflammation , the title came up and it fitted there perfectly , ' says @entity30			1
some years later they saw an article written by @entity71 , professor at the @entity72 , together with @entity48 , @entity73 at the @entity74			0
the subject of the article was whether blood cells can change and become nerve cells			0
' the title was ' blood on the tracks : a simple twist of fate ' ; this is the name of the album on the one hand , and a song of @entity5 on the other , and the article contained additional @entity5 references , ' points out @entity30			2
@entity49 and @entity30 then succeeded in introducing ' the times they are a-changin ' into the title in a separate article and , at the same time , sent an email to @entity71 and announced the launch of an internal competition			0
' the one who has written most articles with @entity5 quotes , before going into retirement , wins a lunch at the @entity101 restaurant @entity102 , ' explains @entity49			1
the researchers have quoted lyrics from throughout @entity5 's career			2
@entity71 and a colleague responded with the article ' @entity109 receptors tangled up in two ' in @entity110 the same year , 2010 , the title of which is inspired by @entity5 's song ' tangled up in blue '			2
the following year , @entity49 and @entity30 countered with ' dietary nitrate – a slow train coming ' in @entity116			0
' this article also concluded with a paraphrase of @entity5 : ' we know something is happening , but we do n't know what it is – do we , dr @entity123 ? ' where we jokingly addressed a @entity126 colleague with the same surname , ' says @entity49			2
moreover , @entity32 , professor of @entity128 at the @entity72 and the @entity129 , @entity130 , has also been quoting @entity5 but – until very recently – was completely unaware of the articles of the others			1
' tangled up in blue : molecular cardiology in the postmolecular era'was published in @entity136 ; the same year that @entity49 's and @entity30 's first article with a @entity5 quote was published			2
' the contest is open for everyone , ' says @entity49			0
he goes on to explain that they usually draw attention to one another 's new articles via email			0
the researchers also point out that it is primarily in review articles and commentaries that it is possible to use quotes since these articles are often slightly lighter in tone ( less heavyweight ) than others			2
' but it 's important that the quote is linked to the scientific content , that it reinforces the message and raises the quality of the article as such , not the reverse , ' says @entity71 .			0

contest started with a paper called ' @entity12 and inflammation : the answer is blowing in the wind '
the winner will be the researcher who quotes @entity5 in the most scientific articles before they retire
