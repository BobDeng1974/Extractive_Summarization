it had to be @entity1 , did n't it ? the man who already has social media history woke up this morning to find himself , once again , the unwitting subject of sniggers around the globe when a video of him being nutmegged by @entity4 before awkwardly tumbling on the @entity5 went viral			1
in the stands @entity11 put his hands to his face while up in the commentary box @entity15 branded it ' barbaric '			0
@entity1 ( right ) attempts to shackle @entity4 during @entity20 's @entity19 exit @entity1 's spoof @entity22 account boring @entity1 has amassed over 389,000 followers no matter that his team - mate @entity26 befell the same fate moments earlier , it was funny because it was @entity1			1
@entity1 whose clean cut , straight - talking @entity29 spawned the spoof @ boringmilner @entity22 account ( last count 389,000 followers )			1
@entity1 who we poke fun at because he is the antithesis of everything we say we loathe about footballers			2
no drunken late nights partying , sordid kiss - and - tells or dummy - spitting rows with managers to see here			0
unfortunately , @entity1 will be remembered as being the victim of @entity4 's genius at the @entity5 @entity46 manager @entity45 took to @entity22 and added : ' omg			1
@entity4 made @entity1 famous ' @entity48 's on - loan midfielder @entity47 wrote @entity4 ' ai n't human ' after his ridiculous skills the inference behind the giggles was loud and clear - the dour @entity50 was shown up by the silky - skilled @entity54 master and he really had no right to be on the same pitch			1
but who does ? not many on the planet could have lived with @entity4 as he waltzed and weaved through the parting sky blue seas on wednesday night			0
at times it appeared as though he was playing a different sport			0
@entity1 was not alone in being made to look foolish			0
@entity4 was in stunning form , producing an incredulous nutmeg that drew gasps from the football world @entity68 goalkeeper @entity67 echoed @entity15 , tweeting ' watching the game with my legs closed ' the @entity73 ace leaves @entity1 on the floor after passing the ball through his legs and skipping past him he will , however , take all of this in his stride			1
the latest twist in a season which , for him , has been far from boring			0
once again , he has played all over the park			0
central midfield , full back , wing - when @entity85 suffered a striker shortage he even put him up front			2
and the @entity90 , in a rare dropping of the guard , was quick to praise his mr @entity91 in an interview before @entity20 's 1 - 0 defeat			1
' it would be very difficult to find a more complete player than [ @entity1 ] @entity1 , ’ @entity85 told @entity96			1
‘ there are players who are better technically			0
' there are players who head the ball better			0
but show me a player who does all the things that @entity1 does well and there is n’t one			2
' darts player @entity108 wrote on @entity22 that ' @entity4 could nutmeg a mermaid ' former @entity110 manager @entity11 witnessed @entity1 's embarrassment from the stands @entity114 striker @entity113 wrote that @entity11 's reaction said it all about @entity4 's skills @entity1 drops to his knees as @entity20 fail to reach the @entity119 last eight for the fourth year in a row @entity4 inspired the @entity121 to a 1 - 0 victory ( 3 - 1 on aggregate ) on wednesday to send @entity110 through in what could have been a testimonial dinner speech , the appreciative manager added : ' whatever position i put him in he plays well : at full back – which is the only place he does n’t like playing – attacking midfield , wide , or as a striker			1
i used him this season as a forward and the team was scoring three goals a game			0
‘ you leave him on the bench and he is furious , but watch him during the game , encouraging and shouting			0
and in the next training session he kills it for 95 minutes			0
' it ’s very difficult to find another @entity1 – an intelligent player , with big balls and a massive heart			1
’ @entity85 insists that it would be difficult to find a more ' complete ' player than @entity1 @entity1 has only started 15 @entity149 games , making most of his appearances from the bench all of the above counts for nothing when the @entity154 goes into a mean meltdown			1
but it matters to others who are ready to pounce should @entity20 fail to reach an agreement to extend a deal that runs out in the summer			1
at home , @entity160 and @entity161 have registered an interest			2
at the turn of the year there were approaches from clubs abroad and offers of pre-contract agreements			0
none were signed because @entity1 , as always , wants to do the right thing and to him that is honouring the deal he signed at the @entity174			2
@entity85 is keen to get a new deal done			2
but the man with big balls is playing hard ball - and he has every right to do so			0
the @entity181 international scores from a free - kick to earn a point against @entity184 in february @entity1 celebrates a @entity186 brace against @entity187 - he has scored five goals in his last 10 games the 29 - year - old is yet to agree a new deal at the @entity174 with @entity161 and @entity160 interested @entity192 hails ' special night ' for @entity110			1
