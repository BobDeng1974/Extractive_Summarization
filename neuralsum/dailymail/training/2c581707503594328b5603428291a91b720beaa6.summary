by @entity0 published : 07:02 est , 24 october 2012 updated : 08:40 est , 24 october 2012 a fisherman got the shock of his life after accidentally catching a massive shark just 100 yards off the @entity6 coast			1
skipper @entity7 and his crew were fishing for seabass when they hauled in the 320 - pound thresher shark just north of @entity12 , @entity13			1
luckily for the crew of the @entity16 the thresher was already dead when it was brought onboard			2
at 15 feet from its nose to the tip of its trailing tail , it could have decapitated a man with just a single swish			0
jaws - dropping : skipper @entity7 with the 320 - pound thresher shark he caught off @entity12 , @entity13 killer : the 15 - foot shark could have decapitated a man with its powerful tail the shark - a relative of the @entity31 - was lurking thousands of miles from its usual home in the seas around @entity36 and @entity37			1
but it drew a huge crowd when it was brought into @entity40 and then again when it was sold at @entity41			0
@entity7 said : ' there was nothing that could have been done to rescue it			0
a shark needs oxygen to breath and it got wrapped up in the net which was too tight for it			0
' if the shark was alive when it came up we would have freed it			0
as it was dead the shark was taken to the fish market to be sold			2
' trapped : the predator had suffocated after getting caught in fishing nets sighting : a thresher shark was captured on camera as it leapt from @entity62 coastal waters earlier this year sharks extract oxygen from seawater as it passes over their gills , meaning they have to keep moving to respire			1
threshers use their long scythe - like tails , which can make up around half of their total length , to stun prey before they tear at the flesh			0
thresher sharks are usually found along the continental shelves of @entity37 and @entity36 in the @entity79 , but exist in all oceans of the world			1
they tend to stay in the open ocean , but do not venture below 500m , preferring to feed on schools of fish at shallower depths			0
the thresher shark has a torpedo - shaped body and small head and teeth			2
it is named after its long scythe - like tail , which is used to stun prey before the shark goes in for the kill			2
the breed is considered a ' vulnerable ' species by the @entity98			0
the predator is the third of its kind to have been caught in @entity13 in the last few months			2
angler @entity103 , 49 , was fishing with friends off the coast of @entity107 when a 350 - pound thresher tugged on his line			1
it took them an hour and a half to haul in the 13 - foot shark			1
and in july a 20 - foot thresher was caught off @entity115 by the trawler @entity117 , which was fishing for mackerel in the @entity119			1
one of the fish was also photographed recently as it jumped spectacularly out of the sea off the @entity62 coast .			0

crew were fishing for seabass off the coast of @entity12 , @entity13 , when they netted the shark
15 - foot , 320 - pound *monster* was already dead after getting caught in nets
the vulnerable species is usually found in the @entity79 around @entity36 and @entity37
