by @entity0 , @entity1 correspondent the @entity3 has rubber - stamped the building of almost 200,000 homes on flood plains since it was formed , figures reveal			1
the under - fire quango agreed to their construction despite concerns they may become uninsurable or that owners could face sky - high premiums			1
official statistics show that since the agency was created in 1996 , up to 14,500 homes have been built every year on low - lying areas near rivers			1
most of the 190,000 homes built on low - lying land since 1996 were constructed without objection from the @entity3 , despite the risk to homeowners councils are obliged by law to seek the approval of the @entity3 if they are considering developments on flood plains			1
if the agency objects , the scheme usually does not go ahead			1
it has been a stressful time for anyone affected by the floods			2
but it seems the task of dealing with the political fallout may also be taking its toll on @entity39 ’s hair			2
the prime minister was looking distinctly greyer as he unveiled £ 10million in aid for flood - hit businesses during a visit to @entity44 and @entity45 yesterday			1

the official figures , which emerged in response to a parliamentary question from @entity53 mp @entity52 , show that an estimated 190,000 homes were built on flood plains since 1996			1
most will have been built without the @entity3 raising an objection			1
in many cases , however , it will have just advised the council on how to ensure the properties are as flood resistant as possible			0
the figures also reveal that , despite @entity53 ’s criticisms of the government ’s handling of the floods crisis , more homes were built in high risk areas under the party than since			1
between 1997 and 2010 , there were 171,700 new homes constructed on flood - risk areas , with a peak of 14,500 in 2006			1
the annual totals have decreased since the last election , down to just 7,900 in 2011			0
planning minister @entity76 said the number was now ‘ at its lowest rate since records began ’			0
he added : ‘ the figure will never be zero , as this would mean there would be a complete ban on any form of development in many existing towns and cities which happen to be flood - risk areas			1
’ instead , new buildings in high risk areas must be ‘ appropriately flood resistant and resilient ’ , he said			0
the figures emerged as the agency yesterday warned that parts of southern @entity93 including @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 and @entity97 could remain under water for ‘ weeks if not months ’			1
although respite from extreme weather is expected , experts said many homes are not yet ‘ out of the woods ’			2
as the relief effort continued in the @entity106 , it was revealed yesterday that offenders have been helping to fill sandbags			0
probation service officials supervised seven convicted criminals as they used 14 tonnes of sand to fill 600 bags on saturday			0
a group of five filled 750 bags the day after			0
meanwhile , @entity39 has pledged to go to every flood - hit area of the country to ‘ try to learn lessons ’ after a visit to @entity119 - upon - @entity120 in @entity44			2
between 1997 and 2010 , there were 171,700 new homes constructed on flood - risk areas , with a peak of 14,500 in 2006 insurance companies will also be called to @entity126 today to discuss the extra help they can give flood - affected households			1

the bosses of firms including @entity145 , @entity146 and @entity147 will meet floods minister @entity148 and cabinet office ministers @entity150 and @entity152			0
a spokesman for the prime minister said : ‘ the insurance sector should be doing as much as they can to support people in terms of proactively going out and contacting individuals who may be affected , and offering the speediest assistance in terms of making claims			0
’ the @entity163 last night said flood victims have so far received £ 14 million in emergency payments – typically between £ 500 and £ 3,000 each			0
some £ 2 million has been paid out for emergency accommodation			0
