by @entity0 published : 08:32 est , 10 march 2014 updated : 09:49 est , 10 march 2014 a mother - of - four said she thought she was going to die after a large snake crawled into her bed while she slept and bit her on the breast			1
@entity6 , 49 , had no idea if the four foot snake was poisonous after it found its way beneath her duvet and sank its fangs into her chest while she slept at her home in @entity14 , @entity15			1
thankfully the creature was a harmless brown belly @entity18 kingsnake which had escaped from a neighbour 's home six months earlier			1
' the fright of my life ' : @entity6 ( right ) said she thought she was going to die after a brown belly @entity18 kingsnake found its way into her bed and sank its fangs into her breast ( left ) the single mother of two girls and two boys said she woke up after feeling an unusual movement beneath her sheets			1
throwing back the duvet , ms @entity6 saw the large snake resting on her chest and started to scream			1
the snake then bit into her breast , leaving bruising and puncture marks			2
describing the incident , ms @entity6 told the @entity40 : ' i was about to get up to get the kids ready to go to school when i threw the duvet back and saw it sitting on my chest			2
' ' i thought the kids were playing some sort of trick on me at first			0
then i saw it move and i got the fright of my life			0
' as soon as i started to scream , it bit me on the breast			2
it was quite sore ... i thought i was going to die			0
' on the loose : the snake 's owner @entity56 ( pictured ) said @entity58 escaped from his tank six months ago			1
he thinks @entity58 is likely to have been living in a derelict house that separates his and ms @entity6 's properties painful : @entity6 says she screamed and tried to sit up when she realised there was an animal in her bed			1
at this point the snake bit into her breast , leaving bruising and puncture marks as she suffered no immediate sickness as a result of the bite , ms @entity6 asked her children @entity75 , 24 , @entity76 , 21 , @entity77 , 16 and @entity78 , 13 , to take photographs of the snake and call the @entity81 for assistance			1
she also told her neighbours what had happened			0
news spread along the street and a short time later the snake 's owner @entity56 , 21 , arrived at her front door to collect it			2
after calling @entity91 @entity81 to say mr @entity56 had come forward , a driver for the animal charity turned his vehicle around and the job was cancelled			0
mr @entity56 said the snake , which he calls @entity58 , had escaped from his tank six months earlier and is likely to have been living in a derelict house that separates his and ms @entity100 's properties			1
it is believed council workers who recently visited the abandoned house may have disturbed @entity58 and caused him to move into ms @entity6 's home			2
help : as she suffered no immediate ill health as a result of the bite , ms @entity6 asked her children to take photographs of the snake and call the @entity81 knowing full well that @entity58 - like all kingsnakes - has no venom , mr @entity56 simply scooped him up in an empty pillowcase and took him home			1
although @entity58 seems more aggressive than usual , this is probably a result of hunger and the fact he has had to fend for himself for the last six months , mr @entity56 said			0
despite there being no risk to ms @entity6 as a result of the bite , kingsnakes are constrictors and the reptile may have killed her had it wrapped itself around her neck			0
worryingly its not the first time @entity58 has escaped from his tank			0
during a previous bid for freedom , he was on the loose in the neighbourhood for two years			0
mr @entity56 even admitted the reptile is nicknamed ' @entity131 ' such is his ability to push his way out the enclosure .			0
