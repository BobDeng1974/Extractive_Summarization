by @entity0 published : 06:06 est , 18 february 2014 @entity2 : 09:22 est , 18 february 2014 a woman who has suffered from constant hiccups for more than a decade says she is in despair over her condition			1
@entity7 , 46 , of @entity8 , has bouts of hiccups five times a day every day , leaving doctors baffled			1
she hiccups every two seconds in episodes that can last up to ten minutes at a time			1
doctors can not work out how to treat her condition hiccups are a result of the layer of muscle below the ribcage , known as the diaphragm , suddenly and involuntarily contracting			1
long - lasting hiccups can be caused by underlying problems such as gastrointestinal or respiratory conditions , or psychological stresses such as anxiety , fear , grief or shock			1
in some cases , they can be treated with anesthetics or anti-inflammatory medication			2
complications can include insomnia , weight loss , exhaustion and depression			2
this means that since the problem began in 2003 , she has hiccuped approximately three million times			1
hiccups are a result of the layer of muscle below the ribcage , known as the diaphragm , suddenly and involuntarily contracting			1
she said : ' i ’ve tried scaring myself and sipping water - all the old tricks , but nothing works for me			0
' i tried hypnosis once which stopped the hiccups for three months , but then they started up again			1
i ’m out of ideas as to what to try next			0
' miss @entity7 , who works in a bingo hall , says her ailment has caused mirth among colleagues and customers			1
she said : ' they began one day while i was at work			1
when i had more episodes the next day , i wondered whether it was something i was eating			1
ongoing : since her problem began in 2003 , miss @entity7 has hiccuped approximately three million times ' they continued for the rest of the week			1
weeks turned into months and years			0
they have n’t stopped yet			0
an inventor claims to have developed a device that stops the hiccups every time			1
it is little more than a plastic stick with a hole in the middle			0
the user bites down on the stick and drinks a glass of water through the hole			0
it appears the hiccups are stopped by the combination of drinking the water and biting the stick , which makes the throat muscles tense			1
the idea was developed after inventor @entity90 had a bout of hiccups and decided to experiment by drinking a glass of water with a pen in his mouth – and it eased his symptoms			1
he said : ‘ they did n’t stop immediately but it was enough to make me believe i was on to something			0
’ more than 10,000 @entity103 have now been sold at a cost of £ 13 for a pack of three online			0
however not all doctors are convinced by @entity109 mr @entity90 ’s idea , pointing out that hiccups normally subside anyway			2
' other staff members have made a bit of a joke about it , and i tend to laugh along			0
but there are moments where it ’s quite embarrassing , particularly when i ’m in front of customers			0
' at those times i really wish the problem go away forever			2
' six months after the bouts began , miss @entity7 saw her gp in the hope of discovering the cause of her hiccups and whether they could be cured			1
she said : ' they tend to occur when i ’m at work and i can feel when they going to start			0
at first i thought it was something i ate or drank , but then i realised i do n’t eat or drink during a shift , so it ca n’t be that			0
' the doctor did n’t know what to tell me			0
he just suggested i take sips of water but he was n’t able to explain why the hiccups had started or what could make them go away			2

miss @entity7 said : ' i do n’t see the point in going back for medical help			1
i do n’t think anyone will be able to help me			0
' a hypnotherapist trained me to imagine putting the hiccups away into a box , and putting that box away forever			2
by filing away the hiccups like that , i seemed to be able to control them			2
@entity170 : miss @entity7 has even tried hypnotherapy , but this only helped for a few months ' perhaps longer sessions of hypnotherapy would work , but if they ’re just going to start up again in a few weeks , i do n’t really think it ’s worth it			1
' it would be helpful to talk to someone who knows what it ’s like , but i do n’t know anyone else who has this problem			0
' i expect i ’ll just have to live with it			0
' the world record for hiccups is still held by @entity186 , an @entity187 who died in 1991			2
he endured 68 years of regular hiccuping between 1922 and 1990			0
in his case , the hiccups began after a pig fell on him .			2
