zookeepers have moved a step closer to saving the @entity2 from extinction after four joeys were born in captivity			2
the @entity2 , the world 's largest carnivorous marsupial , is on the verge of being wiped out by @entity8 , a form of contagious cancer which was only discovered in 1996			2
the rapid decline in their population - up to 90 per cent in some wild areas - has seen a number of zoos launch conservation programs to save the species			1
one of four @entity2 joeys which @entity20 has recently bred in a bid to keep the endangered animal from being wiped out @entity20 is part of a national population insurance program designed to help save the @entity2 , which is experiencing a rapid decline in population from the @entity8 @entity20 , in central @entity27 , is part of a national program designed to help save the species			1
the killer disease , which is exclusive to @entity33 devils , spreads from biting and the first symptoms are small lumps or legions around the mouth , which later develop into large tumours across the animal 's body			2
as the disease worsens , the animals lose the ability to eat and typically die within three to five months , primarily from starvation and the failure of bodily functions			0
the animals are iconic both in @entity49 and overseas			0
it has been the mascot of numerous @entity49 sporting teams , as well as being the basis for the @entity54 cartoon character @entity55			0
