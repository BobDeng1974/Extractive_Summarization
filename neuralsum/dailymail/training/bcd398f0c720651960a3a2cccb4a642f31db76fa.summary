' and to be honest with you , i do n't see why he could n't			2
' his job out here would be flying the @entity36 [ @entity35 ] , or whatever , doing @entity38 missions			2
just the same as us - no - one knows who 's in the cockpit			0
' yes you get shot at , but if the guys who are doing the same job as us are being shot at on the ground , i do n't think there 's anything wrong with us being shot at as well			1
' people back home will have issues with that , but we 're not special			2
the guys out there are , simple as that			0
' @entity3 , 30 , the future commander - in - chief of the @entity58 , is an @entity59 flight lieutenant and works as a @entity20 pilot on @entity62 helicopters			1
daring job : @entity7 's @entity65 work in the @entity13 desert is envied by his older brother @entity3 based at @entity68 on @entity69 in @entity70 , he commands missions to help stranded climbers and stricken vessels in the area			1
prince @entity7 revealed there is envy on both sides			1
' before coming out here i was very jealous of my brother , ' he said			0
' it 's operational flying back home			2
you get all the luxuries of operational flying - the pride , as you call it - and the reward of basically saving people 's lives , which is exactly what we try and do as well			0
' and back home he gets to go home to his wife and dog , whereas out here we do n't			1
we 're stuck playing @entity97 in a tent full of men			1
' while @entity7 flies an @entity24 helicopter , his older brother flies a completely different @entity62			2
' he could fly this			0
i 'd like to think i could fly his , ' he said			0
@entity3 's bedroom is probably nicer than this sleeping area that prince @entity7 called home for 20 weeks captain @entity107 , as @entity7 is known in the army , added with a brotherly dig : ‘ his job 's very cool , and i think he 's doing a wonderful job			1
even though he 's in the @entity59			0

the @entity7 and @entity116 both trained as helicopter pilots , with @entity118 taking part in missions in the @entity121			2
but @entity7 revealed it is not just the family association with rotary aircraft that intrigued him and his brother			2
‘ probably the fact that you can only fit a certain amount of people in a helicopter , therefore no one can follow us - like you guys , ’ he joked with the press			0
‘ our father flew , our uncle 's flown , all sorts of people have flown in my family			0
top gun : prince @entity7 enjoyed his work escorting @entity38 helicopters on daring missions in @entity21 ‘ and i would n't suggest that 's where it 's come from , but it is great fun , and i was given the opportunity in the end , and i could n't say no to it			1
’ in the interview @entity7 , who is ' 100 per cent single ' , also spoke of his happiness about becoming an uncle this summer			1
' obviously i 'm thrilled for both of them , ' he said in @entity21 shortly after news of the @entity160 's pregnancy came out			0
' it 's about time , ' he joked			0
' i ca n't wait to be an uncle			1
' he said he had telephoned the future parents to congratulate them , adding : ' of course i have - i had a chat to them			0
' asked if there was pressure on him to settle down , he said : ' i do n't think you can ever be urged to settle down			0
' if you find the right person and everything feels right , then it takes time , especially for myself and my brother			0
' you ai n't ever going to find someone who 's going to jump into the position that it would hold , simple as that			0
