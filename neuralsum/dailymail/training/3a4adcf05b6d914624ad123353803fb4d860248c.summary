an artist makes incredible delicate and detailed pieces of art just by walking over fresh snowfall			0
55 - year - old @entity4 walks miles in the snow to make these incredible pieces that only last a day before being covered by a fresh snowfall			1
the artist from @entity11 , @entity9 walks over layers of fresh snow with nothing but an expedition compass and a pair of snowshoes to create his slope styling art. the orienteering map designer , finds spaces in between lodges and mountains at ski resorts to create these masterpieces			1
he typically makes his mind - blowing designs in @entity42 , where he lives during ski season , and documents them afterward with awe - inspiring photographs			1
mr @entity4 said : ' most of the time i travel round the @entity47 and hike up mountains , aiming to be on the summit at sunset for good photos			2
my feet are in a bad way but if i can keep my weight off the front of my feet things are not too bad			0
' often i am copying designs i have found , like crop circles or well - known mathematical figures , or repeating designs i have made earlier but failed to get good photos of			2
' some designs i am commissioned to do require a lot of study as to the best way to create it , and this process can take several hours			2
' shapes in the snow : skiers stop to take a look at one of mr beck 's creations			0
he uses a compass and measuring tape to plot his course vortex : the artist creates large , mathematical patterns that have varying effects when viewed from different angles and at different times of the day snow shell : he first plans out the pattern on graph paper , then surveys the site and judges where the major points of the design should be , and starts at one of those points the artist favours level , untracked site with a uniform snow depth of about nine inches of powdery snow pole star : to spread the word , the artist has written his @entity101 page in the snow above the design mr @entity4 first plans out the pattern on graph paper , then surveys the site and judges where the major points of the design should be , and starts at one of those points			1
from the centre he calculates the distance to the other points and walks out and back from the centre to the other points , using either pace counting or a measuring tape to determine the number of steps he needs to take			0
each piece is composed of a series of lines , geometric shapes , or arcs and curves , which he shades in to fill in the pattern			0
it takes him about 10 hours on average to complete a piece and he estimates that he 's walked more than 40km to complete some pieces , which only last until the next heavy snowfall			1
the artist favours level , untracked site with a uniform snow depth of about nine inches of powdery snow to make sure his art looks best in photographs , which he takes from either an aircraft , summit or a ski lift			0
@entity138 : mr @entity4 copies designs he finds , like crop circles or well - known mathematical figures ever decreasing circles : the artist takes the aerial pictures from either an aircraft or a ski lift @entity147 : the artworks are created during the ski season , when mr @entity4 relocates to @entity42 the orienteering map designer , finds spaces in between lodges and mountains at ski resorts to create the masterpieces mr @entity4 , 55 , from @entity11 in @entity9 , poses next to one of his artworks			1

@entity9 *resident* @entity4 can spend 10 hours and walk 40km to create a single design
the *mapmaker* creates them in @entity42 , where he lives during ski season , and takes beautiful photos
simply planning the intricate designs can take hours for the 55 - year - old from @entity9
