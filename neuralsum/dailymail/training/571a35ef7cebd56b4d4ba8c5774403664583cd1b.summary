by @entity1 reporter published : 08:04 est , 27 november 2013 updated : 17:22 est , 27 november 2013 @entity2 and her husband @entity3 have threatened to a lawsuit against @entity5 after it fined them $ 3,500 for posting a negative review a couple who were charged $ 3,500 for writing a bad review about an online shop have fought back and filed their own $ 75,000 lawsuit			1
@entity2 and @entity14 say their credit rating was damaged by the @entity17 fine and have appointed @entity18 to represent them			1
mr @entity14 ordered a trinket from the company in 2008 but the order was cancelled when it was not delievered within 30 days			2
mrs @entity2 then wrote a negative review on @entity24 , slamming the retailer 's ' incompetent customer service ' and ' refusal to ship products to @entity29 , @entity30 '			2
however , @entity31 sent them a demand notice three years later to get the review removed and when that was not done fined them $ 3,500			1
the company claimed mrs @entity38 had violated a ' non-disparagement clause ' buried in the sale terms and conditions			1
the couple , who live in @entity43 , @entity44 , say @entity31 reported their ' debt ' to credit agencies , and say they have since been rejected by numerous lenders			1
for the @entity51 , it all started nearly five years ago when @entity3 decided to order his wife a desk ornament from the @entity30 - based @entity17 as a @entity55 gift			1
the company was unable to deliver the trinket worth less than $ 20 within 30 days and ultimately cancelled the order altogether , leading mrs @entity2 to complain about ' horrible customer service practices ' in her online review			1
' once we put the review up we pretty much forgot about it , ' @entity2 , an executive assistant , told @entity64			2
' it was no different than writing a review , good or bad , about any company			2
' but the long - forgotten written critique came to haunt the couple last summer when @entity14 , a network engineer , got an email from @entity31 demanding a $ 3,500 fee for disparaging the company in violation of its @entity73			1
' we were blown away , ' mrs @entity2 recalled their reaction to the demand			0
nonprofit group @entity18 have now sent a letter to @entity31 threatning to file a lawsuit unless the situation is remedied			2
they have given them until december 16 to rectify the situation with the credit reporting agencies and to compensate them $ 75,000			1
the letter to @entity31 states the damaged credit rating meant they were refused a $ 1,900 loan for a new furnace which left them and their 3 - year - old son without heating for three weeks			1
a credit card and a car loan application were also rejected and they are struggling to sell their home and buy a new one , it said			0
when the family disputed the debt with credit reporting agencies , @entity31 demanded a $ 50 ' dispute fee ' on top of the $ 3,500			1
mrs @entity2 told @entity64 they were ' floored ' when they received the letter			0
she said : ' the threat of doing it was scary enough , but the extent to which they did it blew my mind			0
' she said she attempted to get the review removed from the website but when that failed refused to pay the fine			0
this is @entity2 's critical post on ripoffreport.com for which she was fined $ 3,500 the @entity31 clause stated : ' in an effort to ensure fair and honest public feedback , and to prevent the publishing of libelous content in any form , your acceptance of this sales contract prohibits you from taking any action that negatively impacts @entity128 , its reputation , products , services , management or employees			1
' @entity5 appears to have removed the clause from its terms of sale within the last couple months			2
it appeared on the website as recently as august 2013			0
the couple 's attorney , @entity139 , told @entity64 : ' no one would have expected this from doing perfectly normal , everyday and perfectly legal things			1
' ' i have the right to tell somebody else these guys ripped me off , ' @entity2 said			0
@entity149 previously said the company defended its policy , saying the clause was a ' term of sale '			0
the company also said requiring @entity2 to remove the post or face a fine was a ' diligent effort to help them avoid [ the fine ] '			2
@entity160 has attempted to contact @entity31 for comment			0
@entity2 claims she and her husband have been rejected by several lenders because @entity164 reported her ' delinquency ' to credit companies @entity2 ( pictured with son ) said the family had applications for a credit card and a car loan rejected @entity2 is not the first person to complain about the retailer , with dozens of similar criticisms on @entity24			0
moreover , the @entity175 slapped the company with an ' f rating ' in 2010 for ' not delivering products purchased online in a timely manner '			0
@entity5 today has a ' b rating '			0
@entity183 attorney , @entity182 a judge would likely consider a non-disparagement clause unconstitutional			1
' i think this is outrageous that a company like this would force a consumer to relinquish their first amendment rights to speak about their product as a condition of sale , ' @entity182 told @entity149			0
' i have a serious question about whether a court would enforce that kind of covenant because it 's massively over broad and against public policy			0
