the families of nine of the 26 people killed and a teacher wounded two years ago at the @entity4 filed a wrongful lawsuit monday against the manufacturer , distributor and seller of the rifle used in the shooting			1
the negligence and wrongful death lawsuit , filed in @entity13 , asserts that the @entity15 rifle should not have been made publicly available because it was designed for military use and is unsuited for hunting or home defense			1
' the @entity15 was specifically engineered for the @entity24 military to meet the needs of changing warfare , ' attorney @entity19 , of law firm @entity20 , @entity21 & @entity22 , said in a press release			1
' in fact , one of the @entity30 's specifications for the @entity15 was that it has the capability to penetrate a steel helmet			1
' going for the guns : the families nine of the 26 victims of the @entity4 , and a teacher who was wounded in the december 2012 incident , have filed a lawsuit targeting the makers of @entity43 rifles			1

gunman : @entity48 ( pictured ) shot 26 people on december 14 , 2012 , including his mother and 20 school children messages seeking comment from the defendants were not immediately returned			1
@entity70 , whose wife , @entity71 , was killed in the shooting , said he believes in the @entity73 but also that the gun industry needs to be held to ' standard business practices ' when it comes to assuming the risk for producing , making and selling a product			2
' these companies assume no responsibility for marketing and selling a product to the general population who are not trained to use it nor even understand the power of it , ' he said			0
the plaintiffs include @entity70 and the families of @entity89 , @entity4 , @entity4 , @entity4 , @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity4 , @entity92 and teacher @entity93 , who was injured in the shooting			2
the lawsuit seeks unspecified monetary damages			0
@entity97 , @entity98 's mother , planned a news conference later monday morning with @entity24 rep. @entity100 and @entity24 senators @entity101 and @entity102			0
the @entity4 gunman , @entity48 , shot and killed his mother @entity61 on the morning of december 14 , 2012 , before driving to the school and shooting through the entrance			0
principal @entity107 and school psychologist @entity108 confronted @entity48 at the front of the school , but he shot them dead and fired several shots at teacher @entity93 , who survived after crawling into a meeting room			0
survivor : @entity4 teacher @entity93 ( right ) is joining the families of nine victims in the lawsuit against @entity43			1
she was shot several times by gunman @entity48 , but survived the attack after crawling to safety in a meeting room			0
pictured above receive a certificate of commendation on may 6 , 2013 chaos : the scene near @entity4 on december 14 , 2012 - the day @entity48 went on his deadly rampage @entity127 , @entity128 : shooter @entity129 killed 12 people and wounded 58 when he opened fire on a film screening of @entity134			1
he was armed with an ar - 15 rifle , a 12 - gauge shotgun and at least one of two .40 - caliber handguns			0
@entity138 , @entity139 : @entity140 stole a @entity15 to shoot dead two people in the food court of the @entity143 in december 2012			1
@entity144 , @entity145 : gunman @entity146 assembled an @entity15 - style gun to go on a rampage at his father 's home and @entity153 in june 2013 , killing five people			1
@entity155 , @entity156 : @entity157 shot dead seven people , including himself , using an @entity15 at a post-homecoming party in october 2007 @entity48 then went into two classrooms where she shot 20 children and four more school personnel , including two teachers , before committing suicide as police arrived			1
in the lawsuit , lawyers for the victims say the gun is to blame for the sheer amount of casualties			2
' the number of lives lost in those 263 seconds was made possible by the shooter 's weapon of choice , ' the lawsuit reads			2
the lawsuit goes on to say that while the @entity15 is an efficient weapon on the battlefield , ' engineered to deliver maximum carnage ' , it has ' little utility for legitimate civilian purposes ' and is especially dangerous is the hands of the mentally unstable , like @entity48			1
' there is one tragically predictable civilian activity in which the @entity15 reigns supreme : mass shootings , ' the suit says			2
' @entity193 , mentally unstable individuals and criminals have acquired an @entity15 with ease , and they have unleashed the rifle 's lethal power into our streets , our malls , our places of worship , and our schools			1
' ' the risk of a mentally unstable individual gaining access to an assault rifle and unleashing its military firepower on innocent civilians is not theoretical for @entity43			2
it 's a fact , ' the law firm 's @entity208 added in the press release			0
the suit also points out that the @entity15 is only slightly different from the @entity213 , a weapon banned outside the military			2
deadly : in the lawsuit , the families claim that the @entity15 ( above ) used by @entity48 is only slightly different from the @entity213 ( below ) , a weapon banned from civilian use spot the difference ? the lawsuit claims that an @entity15 is not suited for civilian use either for home security or hunting			1
above , the @entity15 's military counterpart , the @entity213 , which civilians are banned from using instead of downplaying the military quality of the weapon , the lawsuit says the gun 's manufacturer markets the @entity15 as a combat - style gun , citing advertising campaigns and catalogs			1
one advertising campaign called the @entity15 ' the uncompromising choice when you demand a rifle as mission adaptable as you are ' while a catalogue said the weapon had ' military - proven performance '			2
' forces of opposition , bow down			0
you are single - handedly outnumbered , ' another line of chilling advertising copy read			0
in 2005 , @entity246 and president @entity247 approved a federal law that shielded gun makers from lawsuits over criminal use of their products , with some exemptions			0
in a lawsuit over the .223 - caliber bushmaster rifle used in the @entity258 - area sniper shootings that killed 10 people in 2002 , @entity43 and a gun dealer agreed to pay $ 2.5million to two survivors and six families in a 2004 settlement			1
it was the first time a gun manufacturer had agreed to pay damages to settle claims of negligent distribution of weapons , according to the @entity269			0
in that settlement , @entity43 paid $ 550,000 and the @entity272 gun dealer , where the sniper 's rifle came from , paid $ 2million			1
in 2002 , a federal judge in @entity145 ruled that @entity43 and other gun manufacturers were not responsible for a 1999 shooting spree that killed a postal worker and injured five people at a @entity280 in @entity281			1
the judge said a lawsuit by the victims ' families did not show a link between the manufacturers and the shooting rampage			0
dark day : sunday marked the two - year anniversary of the massacre , and again the town of @entity4 , @entity60 refused to hold memorial services for the horrific incident			0
however , they did acknowledge the day by hanging the flag on @entity297 at half - staff the act 's exception is for negligent entrustment lawsuits in which a party can be held accountable for selling a weapon to another party who uses said weapon to cause harm to a third party			0
in order to win their case , the @entity4 families must prove that @entity43 committed negligent entrustment by putting the @entity15 on the market			1
@entity314 , the former director of the @entity269 at the @entity269 , explained the legal argument to the @entity316			0
' the issue in this case will be whether courts are willing to construe the doctrine of negligent entrustment so broadly as to encompass a theory of liability that is based on the sale of a particular gun to the general public instead of to a potentially particular dangerous individual , ' mr @entity314 told the @entity316			0
gun lobbyists have contentiously debated the idea that manufacturers are to blame for the shootings , saying it 's not weapons who kill people - it 's the people who shoot them			2
' it â€™s very easy to blame an inanimate object			0
any kind of instrument in the wrong hands can be put to evil use			0
this comes down to intent - criminal behavior , accountability and responsibility , ' @entity343 , chief executives of the @entity345 said in a june 2013 interview with the @entity351			0
@entity352 has owned the @entity43 gun brand since a merger in 2011			2
for the victims ' families , suing bushmaster is a way of attempting to bring about change in the gun industry , an issue @entity246 has failed to address			2
' if nothing is going to change federally , we might as well try ' in court , @entity362 , brother of killed @entity4 teacher @entity89 , told the @entity316 .			0

families of nine of the 26 people killed and a teacher wounded in the tragedy two years ago suing gun producer @entity43
lawsuit claims @entity43 's @entity15 should not have been *widely* available , since it was designed for military use
