@entity7 frontman @entity6 , who has played as the sole frontman so far in this tournament , is joined in attack by @entity43			0
the @entity281 striker 's introduction against @entity58 had the desired impact as the forward found the net			2

@entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity21			1
@entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity15 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity6 , @entity43			0
tonight could be very interesting ... should @entity1 claim a 1 - 0 victory and @entity57 lose to @entity58 by the same scoreline both teams will finish the group stage with @entity294 records			1

@entity1 need a win against @entity4 and will progress to the last 16 should @entity57 lose to @entity58			1
@entity4 have already been eliminated and so only have pride to play for in this final @entity60 fixture .			0

@entity21 pulls one back for @entity1 *meaning* they need two goals in the last ten minutes to go through to the last 16
@entity6 strikes the ball into the bottom corner and gives @entity4 the lead
@entity51 and co seek historical win and progress into last 16
@entity6 's @entity4 already out of the *competition* in @entity320
@entity24 can lead @entity1 into the last - 16 with a win
they need @entity57 to lose against @entity58 in the other game
