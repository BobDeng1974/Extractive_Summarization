by @entity0 this week i had a smashing time driving @entity4 racing cars - literally smashing , i crashed their 200mph car twice			1
i was invited out to the @entity7 by @entity8 – the current @entity11 @entity10 champion , rock star and all - round good guy			1
it had been raining all morning and it 's my excuse that the wet road surface contributed to my ignominious exit of the track on the third bend			2
i was n't too bothered about my safety - we were well strapped in and had race helmets on – i was more concerned with the fact that i had signed a waiver beforehand saying that i would pay for any damage to the car			0
as the crash barrier got closer and closer i got a sinking feeling deep in my stomach , and wallet			0
@entity39 video incident cameras are usually installed on the cars – these clever devices are basically @entity43 cameras that sit on your windscreen and shows who is at fault in an accident – which is pretty important when driving £ 90,000 worth of high - performance racing car			2
nervous ? @entity0 looks apprehensive ahead of his drive gearing up : @entity0 hangs out with @entity8 ahead of his drive @entity52 who ? @entity0 looks the part as he gears up for a ride the @entity57 camera is also hugely popular for parents who are about to let their older children loose on their family car			1
sadly , on this occasion the @entity39 camera would have only shown that the problem was my poor cornering but luckily no damage was done			0
after lunch @entity8 and @entity4 racing 's @entity69 gave me a further pep talk on how to take the bends and by then the sun had come out and the road conditions were perfect			1
crash ! patient staff help to pull @entity0 's car from the gravel after his crash oops ! @entity0 says there was no damage apart from a slightly dented ego feeling smug ? @entity8 could n't help but gloat a little after @entity0 's spectacular crash @entity8 said i had the makings of a good racing driver – my commitment was total and i put the pedal to the metal at all times , i just needed some more practice			1
on my second time on the track i achieved an impressive first lap time and , buoyed with confidence , started to look for a better racing line			2
at that point disaster struck again , i dropped a gear to hit a tight right - hander and skidded right off the track again - and straight into the gravel			0
helmet hair : @entity0 checks his famous quiff after a drive around the track ask the experts : @entity0 receives a @entity105 from @entity8 and @entity69 thankfully it was n't a bad crash , the car still works fine , but the registration plate was a bit wobbly from where we hit the front of the gravel			1
the only thing that was badly dented was my ego			0
but i 've definitely got the bug for racing now and thanks to @entity119 the owner of @entity4 racing i hope to be back on the track very soon			0
@entity123 also i 'd like to say thank you to @entity125 for the lovely gift of some of her @entity129 sporting clothes			0
i think she gave them to me because she was feeling a bit sorry for me when i put the car into the gravel for a second time			0
lots of love , @entity0			1
