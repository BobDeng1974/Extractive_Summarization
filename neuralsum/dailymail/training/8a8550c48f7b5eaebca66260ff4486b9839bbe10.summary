if she had said it earlier , it would have saved a lot of work			0

' he added : ' the longer this goes on the more likely it is we may see a case in the @entity79			0
' but the @entity79 deals with things like this effectively , they ( the authorities ) handle it			0
' they are ready enough and have the capacity			0
there are a lot of doctors and nurses here who have been out there ( to @entity53 ) with @entity233 , and so who have @entity19 experience , which is invaluable			0
' it comes just hours after @entity236 appealed for calm over threat of virus reaching the @entity79			0

he told @entity86 : ' controls are costly to enforce , inconvenience people and disrupt economic activity while having little or no impact on the spread of infections			0

he told @entity86 : ' in this case , @entity19 has an incubation period of up to 21 days			0
