the @entity0 are being issued with new ammunition designed to kill the enemy outright after they condemned a ‘ shoot - to - wound ’ policy that put their lives at risk			1
the elite troops will now use bigger , heavier rounds to overcome @entity9 insurgents who are determined to fight to the death			0
the bullets upgrade – and a new range of rifles designed to fire them – were recommended in a top - secret report on @entity0 operations in @entity17			1
it called for a return to a ‘ shoot - to - kill ’ policy and for heavier rounds to be issued to troops			1
the report ’s authors described bloody clashes with @entity26 jihadists who managed to ignore their bullet wounds and carry on shooting			1
on target : @entity30 use the powerful @entity32 rifle which are designed to kill the enemy outright the rounds currently issued as standard to @entity0 troops for their rifles are 5.56 mm calibre			1
in future , the troopers will be given 7.62 mm rounds – which are almost twice as heavy and designed to kill with a single shot			0
last night , a regiment insider said : ‘ the shoot - to - wound policy was based on the assumption that once he was wounded an enemy combatant would stop fighting , and so would his comrades to give him first aid			1
‘ but this backfired against the @entity26			1
the 5.56 mm rounds did not take a big enough chunk out of them , allowing fanatical insurgents to keep on fighting despite their wounds			2
as a result , more @entity0 soldiers were shot and badly wounded			1
‘ the need for a heavier round was highlighted in the regiment ’s @entity61 report			2
@entity63 are now taking place on at least three rifles specially designed to fire the 7.62 mm rounds			0
‘ the difference in killing power between 5.56 mm and 7.62 mm is startling – the heavier rounds pack so much more of a punch			0
’ rifles being tested at the @entity0 ’s ranges in @entity73 include the @entity75 - made @entity74 ( @entity77 ) @entity76 – known as the @entity32 - h. it fires 7.62 mm rounds from a newly designed magazine that holds 20 rounds			1
accurate : prince @entity80 with his @entity82 rifle in @entity17 powerful : the @entity32 rifle fires 7.62mm rounds from a newly designed magazine that holds 20 rounds different length barrels are available for close - quarters battle and for longer - range engagements			2
the rifle is already being used by @entity91 units , including @entity30 , who participated in the mission to eliminate @entity95 leader @entity94 in @entity96 in 2011			0
the best - performing rifle of those being assessed by the @entity0 will replace the regiment ’s current standard issue weapon – the @entity102 - manufactured @entity101 , which fires a 5.56 mm round and uses the standard @entity105 30 - round magazine			1
according to military experts , the @entity101 is a versatile weapon that can be fitted with a variety of scopes and aiming devices			0
other attachments include an underslung 40 mm grenade launcher			0
the problem of 5.56 mm rounds lacking killing power in firefights is worse because the @entity26 use 7.62 mm rounds in their @entity117 and @entity118 sniper rifles			1
the @entity0 ’s report said the 7.62 mm rounds flew farther and with greater accuracy – giving the enemy a distinct advantage , especially in long - range engagements			1
the bullets upgrade was recommended in a report on @entity0 ( badge pictured ) operations in @entity17 the only advantage to the 5.56 mm rounds is that , given their lighter weight , soldiers can carry more of them			1
manufactured by @entity133 in @entity134 , they have a steel tip and core			0
the bullets are also lead - free to reduce environmental pollution			1
@entity133 has a £ 2 billion contract with the @entity140 to produce these ‘ ethical rounds ’			0
@entity145 mp @entity144 , a former @entity146 commander , said : ‘ the 7.62 mm round is a good , meaty bullet and will drop your enemy with a single hit			2
the 5.56 mm can not compete with it for stopping power and , according to many soldiers , the round has fallen short in @entity143 and @entity17			0
‘ insurgents who would have been fatally wounded by a 7.62 mm have been able to continue fighting and endanger the lives of our soldiers			0
‘ this is a positive step and i hope other regiments give consideration to returning to 7.62 mm rounds in the infantryman ’s standard rifle			0
it could save lives and win battles			0
’ the @entity140 said : ‘ our troops in @entity17 use a variety of highly effective weapons that fire a range of ammunition			0
they primarily use 5.56 mm rounds fired from the world - class @entity177 assault rifle and these have great power and accuracy			2
‘ for longer - range firefights , troops can use the general purpose machine gun , grenade machine gun , light machine gun and the 7.62 mm longer - range sharpshooter rifle			2
’ l sailors on ships and submarines are to be breathalysed to curb a culture of ‘ binge drinking ’			0
the move follows the fatal shooting of lieutenant commander @entity194 , 36 , on nuclear submarine @entity195 in 2011 by drunk able seaman @entity196 .			2
