if @entity1 survived telling a paying @entity3 fan to ' f * * * off and die ' from the touchline during a game at the @entity7 , it would be a surprise if he got the sack for grabbing an opposition player by the throat and refusing to let go of his shirt when he wanted to rejoin the game			1
it was a bizarre incident with @entity15 on saturday as the @entity16 lost to @entity17 , something @entity1 could easily have avoided or laughed off			1
instead he has added to his burgeoning reputation as something of a loose cannon			0
and that ’s a shame			0
@entity1 gets to grips with @entity17 's @entity15 during this by - now infamous incident @entity1 appeared in relaxed mood in front of the media on monday after a bizarre turn of events at @entity3 six years ago @entity1 was in charge of @entity3 in the third tier of @entity35 football : they were losing at local rivals @entity37 and could n’t even win at @entity38 , currently rooted to the bottom of the football league			1
the club has come a long way , and after a spell away from the @entity44 , @entity1 returned to lead @entity3 to the @entity45 in some style			1
he did very well not just to guide the club to the top flight , but also to finally bury their reputation as chokers			2
@entity1 needs to represent the club with much more class on the touchline , that ’s for sure			0
but in my opinion he should be judged on the strikers he ’s signed			0
since sealing promotion @entity1 has been given more money to spend than the other two promoted sides , yet @entity3 are bottom			2
@entity1 led @entity3 to the @entity45 promised land in his second stint in charge of the club in the second full season of his second stint at @entity3 , @entity1 led the foxes to automatic promotion @entity69 came in from @entity70 for a club record £ 8million last summer , and last month that record was broken again when @entity73 arrived for £ 9million			1
@entity69 started brightly but has scored just twice in his last 19 league appearances			0
@entity73 has yet to score , and after he was left out of the starting line - up on saturday , @entity1 explained that the @entity45 is ' ridiculously quick ' , and his big signing ' needs time to adjust '			1
@entity3 do n’t have time , and with the strikers who took them up struggling – @entity79 has scored once since the win over @entity81 in september while @entity82 has drawn a blank since that famous 5 - 3 victory – they need the record signings to deliver			0
@entity1 has been given the money , and he has put his faith in these two strikers			0
if they deliver the goals to keep @entity3 up he ’s been a success , if they do n’t score and the @entity16 go down , @entity1 will have failed			2
tidying up his touchline act is the least of his concerns			0
after a promising start to life in the top flight , the goals have dried up for @entity98 ( left ) @entity73 ( left ) was bought for £ 9.5m in january to solve @entity3 's lack of goalscoring prowess			1

@entity1 told a fan to ' f * * * off and die ' and grabbed @entity17 's @entity15 round the throat during saturday 's 1 - 0 *defeat*
@entity1 was the *man* who returned @entity3 to the @entity45 but they are currently bottom of the top flight , despite serious *investment*
@entity69 came in from @entity70 for £ 8m in summer , but the goals have dried up for the @entity111 after a promising start
the club record was once again *smashed* in january with @entity115 striker @entity73 arriving for £ 9m
and the fate of the @entity16 boss will *largely* *lie* on how these two fare in the business end of the season
