published : 04:33 est , 30 august 2012 updated : 14:59 est , 30 august 2012 scientists have taken an important step towards helping visually impaired people lead independent lives after a bionic eye gave a blind @entity6 woman partial sight			1
@entity8 , who has severe vision loss due to the inherited condition retinitis pigmentosa , was fitted with a prototype bionic eye in may at the @entity12			1
it was switched on a month later , and today researchers revealed the results			2
' i had these goggles on and i did n't know what to expect , and i do n't know if anyone did know what i was going to see			2
' then all of a sudden i went ' yep ' i could see a little flash and it was like a little , i suppose , a splinter			1
' there were different shapes and dark black , lines of dark black and white lines together			2
' then that turned into splotches of black with white around them and cloud - like images			2
' i can remember when the first bigger image came i just went " wow " , because i just did n't expect it at all but it was amazing			2
' the bionic eye , designed , built and tested by the @entity19 , a consortium of researchers partially funded by the @entity6 government , is equipped with 24 electrodes with a small wire that extends from the back of the eye to a receptor attached behind the ear			1
it is inserted into the choroidal space , the space next to the retina within the eye			0
' the device electrically stimulates the retina , ' said dr @entity61 , a specialist surgeon who implanted the prototype			0
' electrical impulses are passed through the device , which then stimulate the retina			0
those impulses then pass back to the brain , creating the image			0
' surgeon dr @entity61 ( r ) performing an eye examination on ms @entity8 ( @entity69 ) , who has become the first recipient of a radical ' bionic eye ' the device restores mild vision , where patients are able to pick up major contrasts and edges such as light and dark objects			1
researchers hope to develop it so blind patients can achieve independent mobility			0
' @entity84 is the first patient of three with this prototype device , the next step is analyzing the visual information that we are getting from the stimulation , ' @entity82 said			0
the operation itself was made simple so it can be readily taught to eye surgeons worldwide			0
' we did n't want to have a device that was too complex in a surgical approach that was very difficult to learn , ' @entity82			0
similar research has been conducted at @entity95 in @entity96 by researchers who have deciphered the neural code , which are the pulses that transfer information to the brain , in mice			0
how it works - the bionic eye implant uses special glasses to send data to an implant in the brain			1
it has already been implanted successfully there , researchers have developed a prosthetic device that has succeeded in restoring near - normal sight to blind mice			0
according to the @entity117 , 39 million people around the world are blind and 246 million have low vision			1
' what we 're going to be doing is restoring a type of vision which is probably going to be black and white , but what we 're hoping to do for these patients who are severely visually impaired is to give them mobility , ' @entity82 said			1
earlier this year , a @entity128 team implanted a similar implant for the first time , and have already placed it in two other patients who are waiting for their devices to ' bed in ' before they are switched on .			1

@entity6 woman was first to receive radical implant
@entity8 has *spoken* for first time of the ' little flash ' that signaled the return of her vision
*breakthrough* one of several projects around the world that could restore vision for millions
