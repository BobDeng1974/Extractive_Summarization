the watchdog is also investigating @entity73 ’s i ’m a celebrity … for using @entity74 , the seven - year - old daughter of contestant @entity58 , for a stunt , and children ’s @entity23 show @entity15 and @entity16 , after a child was left retching following a challenge which involved eating a mixture of apple sauce and mayonnaise			1
so close : @entity58 's daughter was disappointed that she missed out on seeing her mother the regulator also criticised the @entity23 for not having someone directly looking over the teenager ’s interests and suggested the broadcaster should have sought expert opinion on whether it was appropriate for him to have taken part in the scenes			1
