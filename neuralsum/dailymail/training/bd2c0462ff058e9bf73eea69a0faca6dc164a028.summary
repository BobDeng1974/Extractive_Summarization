all - seeing eye : scientists have developed a prototype contact lens that could one day provide the wearer with the news , texts and social networking imagine catching up with your texts , social networking and perhaps the news without having to log on to a computer or even glance at a smartphone			1
messages and images would simply appear in front of your eyes , generated by a computerised contact lens			0
of course , you may not always want to be bothered by such messages if you are doing anything so quaint as – for instance – reading a book or going out walking and enjoying the scenery			0
but until now the concept of info - vision – the ability to stream information across a person ’s field of vision – had belonged to the realms of science fiction , featuring in films such as the terminator series or tv shows such as @entity36			1
however , scientists have developed a prototype lens that could one day provide the wearer with all kinds of hands - free information			1
it could also be used to display directions and tv programmes			0
the lenses , which would be inserted and removed like normal contacts , could also be handy if you are indeed enjoying the great outdoors , allowing you to zoom in on distant views			0
while the amount of information that could appear in front of our faces is tantalising , the researchers insist all the components are tiny and the normal field of vision will not be obstructed			2
one day , perhaps ? how the new information contact lens could work the super-lenses are the brainchild of professor @entity61 , a contact lens - wearing engineer who specialises in making parts on the nanoscale , thousands of times thinner than a human hair			1
@entity67 's take on the development so far , he has created a lens which is implanted with tiny components , including a single led light , an antenna that picks up power and information through a wireless connection , and an electronic circuit			2
the lens was placed into a rabbit ’s eye without causing any problems to its health and the light came on			1
professor @entity61 , of the @entity85 in @entity86 , said : ‘ we have got a rudimentary display with one dot			0
if you had several dots , you could maybe create arrows , to give people directions			2
’ the professor envisions that one day we will be able to stream all the information we need directly on to the contact lens			2
he is also investigating the idea of incorporating sensors that will pick up blood sugar levels and other potentially important medical information			1
he told the @entity102 : ‘ the surface of the eye is covered in live cells and the body has to keep them alive , so they are in direct contact with the bloodstream			2
’ a bionic eye that could restore the sight to the blind is to be tested on @entity114			1
small - scale trials on the @entity116 have already produced ‘ quite astonishing ’ results			0
the tiny implantable microchip allowed men and women who thought they would never be able to see again to read a clock and identify everyday objects			0
let there be light : a microchip packed with 1,500 sensors is implanted in the back of the eye			1
this then stimulates nerves in the retina which pass signals down the optic nerve to the brain to create an image now , the wafer - thin device is to be implanted in @entity114 for the first time , with the first operations due within weeks			1
up to 12 men and women will be treated , with the surgery taking place in @entity143 and @entity144			0
if these , and similar operations in @entity148 , prove the device from @entity150 firm @entity149 to be safe and effective it could be on the market by 2013			0
most of the @entity114 treated will be middle - age and all will have retinitis pigmentosa , a hereditary disease that destroys the light - sensitive retina at the back of the eye			1
a microchip packed with 1,500 light sensors designed to replace those lost to disease is implanted in the back of the eye			1
the sensors convert light to electrical signals			0
these stimulate nerves in the retina which pass signals down the optic nerve to the brain to turn into an image			0
@entity173 , the surgeon who will lead the @entity143 arm of the trial , cautioned that the surgery is still experimental and the device does not work in all cases .			0

prototype could create hands - free information
was placed into a rabbit ’s eye without causing any health problems
inventor also looking to incorporate sensors to pick up important medical data
meanwhile , @entity114 to try out bionic eye which could *end* blindness
