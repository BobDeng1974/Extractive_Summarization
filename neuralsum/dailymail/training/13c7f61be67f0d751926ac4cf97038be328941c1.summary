by @entity0 published : 08:01 est , 6 december 2013 updated : 13:21 est , 6 december 2013 a council has made more than £ 150,000 in just two months from a yellow box junction , leaving motorists fuming			1
local motorists have accused @entity5 of ' predatory ' behaviour after it emerged that a single hatched box in @entity9 , @entity7 has been responsible for fines totaling around £ 2,500 a day			1
another box junction in nearby @entity13 town centre was almost as lucrative , raising £ 100,000 over the same period			1
a fine mess : the innocuous - looking box junction where drivers have had to pay £ 153,000 in @entity9 , @entity7 law teacher @entity17 , who was fined in october , lodged a @entity19 request after the council took over moving traffic enforcement from police			1
the figures reveal that in october and november , motorists paid out £ 153,835 in fines from the highest - grossing junction in @entity9 , and £ 100,203 from the one in @entity13			2
mr @entity17 , who was handed a fine on october 16 , said : ' it is very disturbing and i think it shows the council is not being proportionate			1
' the word that i would use is predatory			0
i do really feel the council is just seeing drivers as targets			0
' each fine costs £ 130 , but is halved to £ 65 if motorists pay within two weeks			1
the @entity7 town is in outer @entity40 and its roads are frequently gridlocked			2
cash cow : the other junction in @entity13 town centre where drivers had to pay £ 100,000 in fines so town hall chiefs introduced more of the box junctions , which are reserved for moving traffic in order to stop junctions getting blocked when traffic lights change			1
nudging into the painted area is a well - known offence in the @entity55 , and is described as ' entering and stopping in a box junction when prohibited '			1
@entity59 neighbourhood committee chairman , @entity57 , said he was ' surprised ' by the high total			0
' the idea is to get the roads moving , ' he said			0
' in my opinion it is n’t to raise revenue			0
' the dodgy lights phasing [ on the worst junction , fixed last month ] meant the traffic was tailing back			2
but that is not a reason why people should enter the box junction when the exit is n’t clear			2
' spy camera : circled , what is thought to be one of the cameras that registered motorists ' numberplates the @entity82 newspaper obtained the november figures after mr @entity17 revealed the figures for october			0
a @entity5 spokesman said : ' we always take any mitigation submitted into account when reviewing a case			0
' drivers who believe they were fined unfairly must first appeal to the council involved , then to an independent adjudicator - but many pay up , because of the time and bureaucracy involved			0
and if drivers lose an appeal at the highest level , they have to pay at the full £ 130 rate and sometimes even have to foot the council 's costs			1
communities secretary @entity102 has launched frequent attacks on councils for employing ' over-zealous ' traffic control measures , particularly through @entity106			0
by law , money from fines must be put back into road maintenance or public transport , after being used to pay for the cost of enforcement .			0

fines costing £ 130 each were handed out by @entity5 , @entity7
' predatory ' town hall chiefs have taken over traffic enforcement from police
another box junction nearby raised another £ 100,000 in the same period
