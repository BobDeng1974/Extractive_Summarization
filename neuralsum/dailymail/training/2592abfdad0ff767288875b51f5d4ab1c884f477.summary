as a textbook example of how not to handle a scandal , it would be hard to beat the @entity4 affair			1
no - one has emerged from it with any credit , with the result @entity4 ’s request for privacy and obvious need for it as he deals with his ‘ personal challenges ’ has been rudely violated			2
just imagine if last thursday , @entity4 ’s statement explaining he was taking an indefinite leave from the game gave a proper insight into his problems			1
nothing salacious , just the barest facts			0
is there one among us who would have felt the need to cast the first stone ? instead , there was a rush to fill the vacuum , with @entity28 publishing a story online that was positively cruel in its lurid allegations of @entity4 ’s party lifestyle			1
talk about kicking a man when he ’s down			0
the central claim made , though , was a serious one : @entity4 had been given a six - month suspension for violating the tour ’s anti-doping policy concerning recreational drugs			1
hiatus : @entity4 is to take an immediate break from golf getaway : @entity4 revealed his decision in a statement on thursday night and will miss the @entity44 all smiles : @entity4 ( right ) got engaged to @entity46 ( left ) earlier this year now say this is true , despite the @entity49 ’s insistence that he is not banned but on voluntary leave , would it have been the end of the world to own up to it ? it would n’t be like he would have taken steroids , would it ? there ’s clearly a path to redemption			1
and would n’t he have been left in peace to deal with his demons ? he could have come back when he was ready a new man			0
instead we ’ve had a lamentable apparent lack of transparency from the tour and @entity4 ’s hapless management company that has just allowed the sorry mess to rumble on and on			2
if the @entity28 story is wrong , why is n’t his agent expressing his fury and taking legal action ? perhaps this is yet to happen			1
if not imagine what it will be like when @entity4 does come back			2
you can picture the first question right now			0
‘ did you test positive for drugs ? ’ and so on			0
all they have done is suspend the questions for another day			0
late on friday night the tour issued a statement in the wake of the @entity28 story			1
it read : ‘ this is to clarify that mr @entity4 has taken a voluntary leave of absence and is not under suspension from the @entity88			1
’ party boy : @entity4 poses for a photo with @entity46 on @entity91 in fact , it clarified nothing and smacked of more opacity			2
many within the game believe it nothing more than an exercise in lawyerly semantics , akin to the man resigning before he is sacked			0
@entity103 ’s @entity44 captain @entity102 summed it up perfectly on @entity105			2
‘ the @entity88 policy is a very risky one because now they are reacting to events as they happen , which is not where you want to be , ’ he said			0
let ’s hope lessons are learned .			0

@entity28 published story *accusing* @entity4 of taking recreational drugs
@entity119 said he was taking indefinite leave , will miss @entity44
*situation* has been handled badly , his agent must comment
