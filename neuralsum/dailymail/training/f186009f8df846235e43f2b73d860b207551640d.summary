cool commuters might like the idea of skateboarding to work			0
but it can be difficult to balance while carrying a bag full of papers and a precious laptop and skating along busy streets			0
to solve this problem , one @entity9 inventor has come up with a skateboard built for business as it has a handy compartment inside its wooden body to carry all the bits and pieces needed for a day in the office			2
the skateboard has a compartment designed to hold keys , mobile phones , folders and even a small laptop			1
its compartment measures 18inches ( 46cm ) by 7inches ( 18cm )			1
the concealed box can be accessed by lifting a lid , or the board , of the skateboard and is lined with shock absorbent foam to protect delicate items			0
custom - made versions cost from around £ 600 ( $ 1,000 ) but the basic version that will be sold on @entity29 will cost around £ 90 ( $ 150 )			1
@entity44 designed the skateboard to hold keys , mobile phones , folders and even a laptop			1
the storage section of the ' @entity19 ' board is 18inches ( 46cm ) long and 7inches ( 18cm ) wide so that it can be used for carrying day - to - day items while skating along			1
a layer of shock - absorbent foam lines the compartment to protect fragile belongings placed inside the box			2
the skateboard looks normal until the lid is lifted up and the box is revealed , which is kept shut by two metal catches , so the contents do n’t suddenly fall out			0
mr @entity44 , 29 , from @entity62 , came up with the idea for @entity19 while he was skateboarding from class to class at university with a rucksack on his back			1
the skateboard looks normal until the rugged ' lid ' is lifted up and the container is revealed , which is kept shut by two metal catches so the contents do n't suddenly fly out in transit			0
here you can see the box element of the board and how it effectively has a double - thickness board ‘ i used to carry a rucksack with me while i did it but i soon became tired doing that for five hours every day and i knew there had to be a solution , ’ he said			0
‘ i thought it would be a good idea if i could put my stuff inside my skateboard and travel around that way			0
he developed a prototype by fixing a wooden box to an old board and placing another on top , which he attached using a hinge			0
now , the designer is custom making longboards for clients at a cost of around £ 600 ( $ 1,000 ) although special versions can cost much more			2
mr @entity44 said : ‘ i took two old skateboards and attached one on top of the other with a hinge , and then made a compartment from a piece of wood , which became my prototype			1
mr @entity44 is planning to launch a basic version of his design called @entity19 ( pictured ) on crowd funding website @entity29 next month where he will raise money to use for the manufacturing costs			1
the basic version of his design is set to sell for around £ 90 ‘ it was big enough to hold essentials like my calculator , pencil , keys , and phone			1
‘ i started using it and when i was in a design class the person leading the course said i should get it patented , which i did			0
‘ i launched my company , @entity122 and i now make customised longboards with storage compartments for people			0

‘ although i do n't think the skateboard will replace the rucksack , i think it will work great as an addition , ’ mr @entity44 added .			2

an inventor from @entity62 designed the @entity19 , which has a compartment that is 18inches ( 46cm ) long and 7inches ( 18cm ) wide

@entity44 is launching a @entity29 *campaign* so that he can manufacture basic versions of his custom - made skateboards for just £ 90
