@entity8 used these figures to work out the average @entity19 for each country and has created computer - generated images to show how the nationalities stack up against each other			1

commenting on this relatively high @entity19 in @entity13 , @entity8 said : ' @entity13 has a culture that respects food from the farm , and teaches its children to value a well - balanced diet and proper meal times			0
yet , the @entity2 culture of eating anytime is catching on in @entity13 and may be the cause of increased obesity levels			0
' @entity8 gathered the measurements from the @entity96 in the @entity2 , the @entity97 , @entity98 and the @entity99			0
he then used a computer program to create the average male image			0
this image shows the average @entity13 man the average @entity12 man , pictured , was the only group to fall in the healthy @entity19 range , compared to the other countries studied in the @entity14 , average men measure 35.8 inches ( 91cm ) and were by far the tallest of the group with an average height of 6ft ( 183.3cm )			1
