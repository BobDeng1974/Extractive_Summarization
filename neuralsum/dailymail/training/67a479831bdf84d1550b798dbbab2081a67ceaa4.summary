pick @entity0 for a dash at @entity4 @entity3 glory next summer @entity5 seems to be against young @entity7 players @entity0 , @entity8 and @entity9 joining up with the @entity3 next summer			1
all would be eligible to play at the @entity11 in the @entity12 , and many have suggested that the senior side 's younger players should drop down and get tournament experience under @entity17			1
but @entity5 believes full internationals should n't consider it , partly because they ' wo n't play with the same quality			1
' @entity5 does n't want @entity0 ( @entity21 ) and @entity8 ( c ) playing for @entity3 's @entity22 the @entity7 boss believes a player is ' never good ' when he drops down from his senior international side @entity9 will be another gunner who would be eligible for the @entity11 in 2015 ‘ once a guy has moved up to the full national team , you put him down and he is never good , ’ @entity5 said			1
‘ on the selfish front for us , when a guy has played 50 games , it is better he has a good rest during the summer			0
but , most of the time , when they move down , they are not completely at their quality			0
’ @entity5 's comments seem to contradict those of @entity8 's , who said he would be delighted to play for the @entity3 in 2015			1
@entity7 star @entity8 's comments seem to contradict those of his manager 's ' yes ( i ’d play at the @entity45 if i was asked ) , you ’d never turn your nose up at something like that , ’ said the 21 - year - old , who has 18 @entity3 caps			1
‘ but there ’s a lot that goes into that because the national team have two games around the same time as the tournament			0
so it ’s up to @entity59 to decide what he wants			0
‘ there ’s a lot of players in the @entity3 squad at the moment that could drop back down and play for the @entity3 so it ’s up to the manager to decide			2
‘ when that time comes around i ’ll have to think about it			0
@entity17 ( @entity69 , @entity3 manager ) might not even want me			2
it ’s a discussion that will be had closer to the time with the @entity3 manager , someone at @entity7 and @entity17			0
’ the line - up in red is the one that beat @entity76 in the play - off , but the blue team is what @entity3 could field many , including @entity80 , believe @entity81 should play in the @entity12 next summer			2

@entity0 , @entity8 and @entity9 eligible to play for @entity3 at @entity11 next summer
all play for @entity3 's senior team but many believe they should drop down
@entity5 is not one of them , he says they wo n't be the same player
*claims* they would not play at the same level after dropping down
