by @entity0 published : 00:37 est , 4 february 2013 updated : 20:20 est , 4 february 2013 @entity1 has unveiled a guide for the atheist from @entity6 to the @entity7 , the majority of religions have a code of rules for followers to practice			1
and now philosopher @entity1 has created a set of 10 new rules for atheists			1
the best - selling author said he was unveiling his manifesto for @entity16 in an attempt to promote overlooked virtues including resilience and humour			1
@entity21 , whose work includes a stint as a writer in residence at @entity26 , said he came up with the idea in response to a growing sense that being virtuous had become ' a strange and depressing notion ' , while wickedness and evil had a ' peculiar kind of glamour '			1
he said : ' there 's no scientific answer to being virtuous , but the key thing is to have some kind of list on which to flex our ethical muscles			1
' it reminds us that we all need to work at being good , just as we work at anything else that really matters			2
' the 43 - year - old writer , who once summarised @entity47 's work as a guide on how to lead better lives , compiled a list that atheists can look to as a moral compass			1
he emphasizes the importance of being polite which is linked to tolerance , and how sacrifice is essential for a happy family life			1
the 10 rules for atheists are : 1			2
keeping going even when things are looking dark			0
the capacity to connect imaginatively with the sufferings and unique experiences of another person			0
we should grow calmer and more forgiving by getting more realistic about how things actually tend to go			0
the writer says that like anger , humour comes from disappointment , but it 's disappointment optimally channelled 4			1
we wo n't ever manage to raise a family , love someone else or save the planet if we do n't keep up with the art of sacrifice			2
politeness is very linked to tolerance , the capacity to live alongside people whom one will never agree with , but at the same time , ca n't avoid			0
like anger , humour springs from disappointment , but it 's disappointment optimally channelled			0
to know oneself is to try not to blame others for one 's troubles and moods ; to have a sense of what 's going on inside oneself , and what actually belongs to the world			0
it 's recognising that living with others is n't possible without excusing errors			0
pessimism is n't necessarily deep , nor optimism shallow			0
confidence is n't arrogance , it 's based on a constant awareness of how short life is and how little we ultimately lose from risking everything .			2
