construction activity has grown for the last 15 months , recording figures above 50 ( or no change ) in the @entity22 / @entity11 survey the home building market grew at its steepest level since november 2003 , driven by strong demand for new housing projects , according to july data from the @entity29 report			1
overall , the index edged down to 62.4 , down from 62.6 in june , but activity remained well above the 50 level that divides growth from contraction and was above @entity36 expectations of 62			2
