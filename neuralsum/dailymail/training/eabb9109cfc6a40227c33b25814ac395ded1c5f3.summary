@entity0 has denied it ever deleted - and then reinstated - a @entity3 story about a notorious child killer under the controversial ‘ right to be forgotten ’ @entity7 ruling			1
the search giant had informed @entity3 earlier this month that a story about killer @entity10 , which appeared on the website in november 2007 , had been removed from @entity14 search results			1
the father of @entity10 's 11 - year - old victim @entity17 had described the removal of the article as ' appalling '			1
father @entity20 said : ' he has n’t got the right to be forgotten - it ’s terrible			2
' he ’s locked up in prison for life and he keeps coming up with things			0
we ’ll never get peace , this has been going on for 40 years			0
the article about the conviction of @entity51 , 61 , is just one of thousands @entity0 has removed from search results and just one of numerous @entity3 articles affected by the ruling			1
a story about a millionaire banker blamed for helping cause the global financial crisis was among the first to be hidden as was an airline accused of racism by a @entity63 job applicant			0
however , a spokesman from @entity0 early saturday said that while the article had been removed from some search results it was not at the request of @entity10			1
and he said the request had been granted to someone else mentioned in the article but that the story would still appear if @entity10 was used at the search term			1
under the right to be forgotten rule , stories are not entirely deleted by @entity0 , rather they simply will no longer appear if a certain search name is used			1
the spokesman refused to say who had asked for the article to be removed and thus granted the right to be forgotten			1
the body of @entity17 being removed from the windswept moor where @entity10 left it in october 1975 @entity10 , a book dealer and married father of one , snatched @entity34 off the street near her home in @entity40 as she went to buy bread for her mother in october 1975			1
he had been on the way to visit his wife and her new baby in hospital			0
@entity10 killed @entity34 in a frenzied attack , stabbing her 12 times , once through the heart , before leaving her body on a lonely moor in @entity102			1
he then kept quiet when an innocent man , @entity17 , was tried , convicted , sentenced and served 16 years for a crime he did not commit			0
the real killer was only captured in 2006 when a @entity107 sample @entity10 had given in relation to an attack on a prostitute in 2005 was found to be an exact match for sperm found on @entity34 's underwear			1
in 2007 , he was found guilty of murder at @entity115 and told he would not be considered for parole until 2037 , by which time he will be 84			0
he attempted to appeal his conviction in 2008 , but was rejected			0
@entity118 , executive director of @entity119 , said : ' it is deeply problematic that a private company can make decisions about things that get censored , as they will end up making mistakes			0
' the @entity126 's economics editor , @entity125 , was affected by the ruling when he had a 2007 blogpost about the former @entity130 boss @entity129 excluded from some search results			1
he said today of the @entity3 's story : ' it does not seem to be in the public interest for the " right to be forgotten " to be applied to stories such as this one			0
' paedophile convicted of @entity17 murder - after evading justice for 32 years original article that was published by @entity3 on 16 november 2007			1
@entity17 was abducted and stabbed to death by @entity10 in october 1975 @entity10 , 54 , will serve a minimum of 30 years for what the judge called ' a truly dreadful crime ' , adding that he accepted the killer would probably die in jail			1
@entity17 , from @entity40 , was abducted and killed in 1975 , in a case which resulted in one of @entity150 's most notorious miscarriages of justice			2
her body was found on @entity154 in @entity102 and @entity17 , a lonely misfit , confessed to the crime under duress			0
he was jailed and served 16 years before he was cleared in 1991 when it emerged that sperm samples taken from her clothes could not have been his , as he was infertile			0
he died the following year			2
forensic scientists used new techniques to produce a dna profile in 2000			0
and last year they found that @entity10 , who had given a sample after being arrested in 2005 on another matter , was a one - in - a - billion match			1
court records also showed that days before mr @entity169 stood trial , @entity10 had abducted a nine - year - old and subjected her to an indecent assault which led to a conviction			1
at the murder trial , @entity10 tried to have this conviction kept from the jury			2
he also argued that the sample from @entity34 's clothes must have innocently become contaminated with his dna			0
but the jury at @entity115 was not taken in			0
mr @entity180 told @entity10 , a trader in comic books : ' you kept quiet whilst an entirely innocent man was arrested , tried , convicted and sentenced for this murder			2
' @entity34 's mother april @entity185 , left , said justice had been done when @entity10 was convicted of her daughter 's murder - not before innocent man @entity17 , right , spent 16 years in jail for a crime he did not commit afterwards @entity34 's mother , who has reverted to her maiden name , @entity195 , said : ' we are relieved that after so long our quest for justice for @entity34 is now over			1
' he appeared to all the world as a caring father - and a hard - working , self - made man			2
but for 32 years , @entity203 lived with a terrible secret			0
behind his respectable facade , he was a paedophile and serial sex attacker who eventually progressed to child murder			2
while his wife and her baby were in hospital in 1975 , @entity10 snatched @entity17 off a street in @entity40 as she went to buy bread for her mother			1
he drove the 11 - year - old , who had learning difficulties , to a windswept moor , sexually assaulted her and stabbed her to death in a ' frenzied ' attack			1
to read the full story click here the @entity227 's ‘ right to be forgotten ’ legislation allows @entity14 citizens to request that links to ‘ inadequate , irrelevant or no longer relevant ’ information be removed from @entity0 search results			1
in short , @entity0 must remove articles if the impact on the individual ’s privacy is greater than the public ’s right to find it , the @entity232 found			2
the landmark case that led to the new legislation was brought by a @entity242 man who complained that an auction notice of his repossessed home on @entity0 's search results infringed his privacy			1
since the legislation was introduced in may , @entity0 has said it has received more than 120,000 requests from across @entity14 ranging from serious criminal records , embarrassing photos and negative press stories			1
an online form was launched to allow @entity227 citizens to ask for personal data to be taken down			0
the form requires links to the material the person wants removed , their country of origin , and a reason for their request			2
individuals also have to attach a valid photo identity			0
@entity0 then assesses each request individually , before deciding whether to remove information from search results			1
since may , @entity3 has had several articles taken down			0
among the most high profile articles removed was one from may 2009 describing the captivity in which @entity272 kept his family			2
it has also included a september 2010 article about multi-millionaire @entity277 mp @entity276 , who admitted hiring private eyes to spy on his local party members			0
a december 2003 column on how the schoolfriend of prince @entity283 , @entity284 , was jailed for nine months after 43 ecstasy tablets , 4.2 grammes of cocaine and three - quarters of a kilo of cannabis were found at his @entity290 flat			0
a march 2004 column by @entity293 , also on mr @entity294 , about how just weeks after he had been allowed home from prison , the @entity291 had put his university studies aside and sold his flat			0
a july 2007 story about teenager @entity299 who was given an asbo for committing 40 per cent of the offences in @entity303 , @entity304			0
an article from 2008 about drunken @entity307 student @entity306 , who drove his @entity309 round the university campus like a scene from the @entity313 job			0
an article from february 2011 about @entity63 airport worker @entity315 who accused airline @entity317 of racism after he was refused a job interview – only to be offered one when he applied two days later using a fake white @entity150 - sounding name			2
a story about @entity324 referee @entity323 , who admitted lying to @entity326 manager @entity325 about the awarding of a penalty in 2010			0

the ruling by @entity14 judges gives people the right to have ' inadequate ' and ' irrelevant ' results about them wiped from the web
