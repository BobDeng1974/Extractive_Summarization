by @entity0 @entity2 scientists have found evidence that the @entity4 was formed from the inside out			1
using data from the @entity9 - @entity8 project , scientists were able to back up predicted divisions in the chemical make - up of stars			1
their research reveals how stars in centre of the @entity4 ‘ live fast and die young ’ , shedding light on the formation of disk galaxies			1
using the eight metre @entity31 in @entity32 , they discovered the inner regions of the @entity4 were the first to form , explaining its ' flying saucer ' shape			1
when the @entity4 first evolved it is thought to have been made purely made of hydrogen and helium			0
the older the star the less it contains other contaminated elements built up over time			0
when the @entity4 first evolved it is thought to have been made purely made of hydrogen and helium			0
pictured here is the centre of the @entity4 from @entity46 the purpose of the @entity9 mission is to create a precise @entity50 map of the @entity4			0
the billion stars that @entity9 will map is still only one per cent of the @entity4 's total number of stars			2
it is @entity56 's successor to the @entity58 satellite which mapped around 100,000 stars			0
@entity58 was the very first mission for measuring astrometry - the positions , distances , motions , brightness and colours of stars			0
it is hoped @entity9 will find also reveal new asteroids , dead stars , and test current theories about our cosmos			0
its map will also become a reference frame to guide the investigations of future telescopes			0
but older and purer stars in the centre actually have very high levels of magnesium			1
magnesium is present in more efficient stars that form quickly , but bursts of magnesium also explosively shoot out of stars as they die			2
this catastrophic event can form a neutron star or a black hole , and even trigger the formation of new stars			2
because of this the astronomers have now worked out that the older stars in the centre will die before those on the outer circle where the sun sits			1
‘ the different chemical elements of which stars - and we - are made are created at different rates - some in massive stars which live fast and die young , and others in sun - like stars with more sedate multi-billion - year lifetimes , ’ said professor @entity99 , lead investigator on the @entity100			2
the findings are the part of the first wave of new findings from the @entity9 - @entity8 survey , launched by the @entity117 at the end of last year			0
‘ we have been able to shed new light on the timescale of chemical enrichment across the @entity4 disc , showing that outer regions of the disc take a much longer time to form , ’ said @entity119 from @entity2 ’s @entity120 , who led the study			1
‘ this supports theoretical models for the formation of disc galaxies in the context of @entity136 cosmology , which predict that galaxy discs grow inside - out			1
’ @entity9 , pictured , is fitted with a @entity140 camera that will also hunt for planets and asteroids			0
it cost £ 620million to build and the project cost a total of £ 2billion the new research also sheds further light on another much debated ‘ double structure ’ in the @entity4 ’s disc – the so - called ‘ thin ’ and ‘ thick ’ discs			1
‘ the thin disc hosts spiral arms , young stars , giant molecular clouds – all objects which are young , at least in the context of the galaxy , ’ explained @entity150 from the @entity151 , a co-author of the study			1
‘ but astronomers have long suspected there is another disc , which is thicker , shorter and older			2
this thick disc hosts many old stars that have low metallicity			1
’ ‘ from what we now know , the galaxy is not an ‘ either - or ’ system			2
you can find stars of different ages and metal content everywhere ’ , said professor @entity119			0
‘ there is no clear separation between the thin and thick disc			1
the proportion of stars with different properties is not the same in both discs - that ’s how we know these two discs probably exist – but they could have very different origins			0
’ in theory , say astronomers , the thick disc could have emerged in a variety of ways , from massive gravitational instabilities to consuming satellite galaxies in its formative years			1
‘ @entity195 has cannibalised many small galaxies during its formation			0
now , with the @entity198 , we can study the detailed tracers of these events , essentially dissecting the belly of the beast , ’ said @entity191 , a researcher at @entity192 in @entity193 , who co-leads the project .			0

scientists studied magnesium levels in older stars to determine their age
their data **suggests** inner regions of the @entity4 were the first to form
this supports existing theoretical models for the formation of disk galaxies
the research also sheds light on another ‘ double structure ’ in galaxy ’s disk
evidence **suggests** a thin and thick disc ' probably ' exists but that they could have very different origins
