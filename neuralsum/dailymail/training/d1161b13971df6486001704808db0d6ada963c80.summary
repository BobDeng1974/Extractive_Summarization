they had rehearsed for weeks			0
so , knowing a very proud mummy was somewhere in the audience , the children stepped up for their big moment … and in walked a policeman demanding the nativity play be stopped , for the grave offence of bad parking			1
with little regard for @entity13 spirit – or the nerves of small wise men and shepherds , never mind @entity17 – he ordered parents to move their cars , which he said were blocking the pavements outside and stopping patients parking at a doctor ’s surgery			1
put your halos up ! @entity28 @entity27 , circled , interrupts the show at @entity31 's nativity play ' @entity32 ' : @entity33 refuted claims that he was heavy handed and said he carried out his duty and that there was nothing else he could have done so as the play restarted , some parents were forced to miss their little one ’s starring role , instead trudging down the road to shift their vehicles			1
yesterday pc @entity27 was accused of ‘ petty meddling ’ and being ‘ heavy - handed ’ for interrupting the nativity play , performed by children from @entity31 in @entity47 , @entity48			1
the play , @entity50 , a humorous take on the traditional nativity scene , was held at the centenary hall in @entity47 , near @entity54 , on monday night			0
an uncle of one of the pupils at the £ 4,860 - a - year school , who asked not to be named , said : ‘ the play had been on for 15 minutes when the policeman walked in and stopped it			1
‘ most of the parents were shocked as they thought someone had committed a serious crime			1
they thought they were going to be arrested			0
regretful parking : many parents were upset as they missed their children performing in the @entity70 nativity play as they had to move their cars ‘ he said , “ excuse me , i have to stop the show as some people have parked in a bad location near the doctors ’ surgery			1
please park down the road and walk back to the hall			0
” ‘ at this stage , everyone laughed as they had all thought that someone was about to be arrested			0
he then stayed until people started to go and move their cars			1
‘ he left after saying sorry for stopping the play			0
the play then restarted even though some parents missed it			2
i think everyone was really shocked that the policeman had stopped the play because of bad parking			2
’ he said some of the parents claimed they had received parking tickets			1
but @entity33 said he had only issued one ‘ warning ’ ticket			1
' @entity97 ' : the play was held at the @entity99 , pictured , in @entity47 , @entity48 move thy car : when the car park outside the @entity104 , left , was full , parents had to park their cars on @entity107 road , right , to which @entity33 objected the uncle added : ‘ it ’s petty meddling and it was a heavy - handed response to what was really not that big a deal			1
’ but @entity33 claims the bad parking was a ‘ safety hazard ’ , explaining he had been on foot patrol when two residents stopped him and complained about it			1
of the play , he said : ‘ they ’d just finished a song and it was near the opening of the play , but there was nothing else i could have done really			0
‘ i did n’t go in there sort of spelling out the law and saying you must do this , wagging my finger or anything like that			1
it was quite low - key			2
‘ i eased in and said , “ look , i do n’t like doing this , sorry to interrupt , but there is a safety issue here			0
you ca n’t park on the pavement ; it ’s not acceptable			0
‘ if you can take this opportunity now to remove those cars			2
’ he added : ‘ it was n’t heavy - handed in any sort of shape or form			2
' it was just a nice , gentle typical neighbourhood police officer response really			2
‘ there was a lack of understanding , i think			0
not from everyone , from some people , thinking well , what ’s the problem			0
‘ they could n’t quite grasp that , yeah , you ’re parked on the pavement and people have to walk on the road it ’s a safety issue			0
’ he added : ‘ if i had n’t done anything , i ’d have got more complaints from the residents than i ’d get from a few parents			0
