@entity9 , an @entity25 asylum seeker , then tied @entity26 up using an electrical flex and forced her to summon best friend @entity28 , 18 , to the flat			1
when miss @entity28 arrived , the crazed killer stabbed her 34 times before slitting her throat - all in front of a distraught @entity26			1
@entity9 then attempted to flee to @entity33 in miss @entity6 's car but was foiled by a fellow refugee who raised the alarm			1

evil : @entity25 asylum seeker @entity9 attempted to flee to @entity33 but was foiled by a brave fellow refugee aftermath : police outside @entity6 's @entity12 flat following the double murders traumatised : @entity6 still has nightmares about the day her sister and best friend were murdered memories : @entity6 has gone on to write a book , while @entity93 ( right ) will remain in prison for the rest of his life tragically , her decision was to have appalling consequences and miss @entity6 says she still feels guilty about allowing @entity93 into her life			1

i am aware i do n't make sense			0
come back and i 'll make it all better and for once in my life i will help someone else , you and @entity147			0
i need you here and i 'll wrap @entity150 around your wounds , for they should have been mine			0

i 'm sorry for all those times you came round to the house of horrors and i did n't answer			0
i pretended there was nobody in			0
i know there 's no excuse but he would n't let me answer to you , he was always jealous of you , he knew how much you meant to me and that @entity147 was the only friend i have ever had			2
