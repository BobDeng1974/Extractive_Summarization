by @entity0 the bus is gasping and shuddering its way down the potholed street , causing my fellow passengers to tut and grumble			2
the irritating ' tssk , tssk , tssk ' tinny drumbeat from someone 's @entity8 is seeping through the cacophony of yells from school children exchanging insults at the back			2
outside the bus , a police siren is wailing			2
but what do i care ? i am cocooned in the land of nod , my head engulfed by a huge sound - proofed cushion that resembles a giant balaclava crossed with an old - fashioned diving helmet , with just my nose and mouth on display			1
out there it may be chaos , but in here i am napping in style			1
their aim was to create simple solutions to everyday needs			2
and where better to start than with the @entity49 's chronic lack of sleep ? ' power - napping improves productivity by 34 per cent , ' explains @entity38			1
' we spend so much time at work , in front of a screen or in transit , we thought : “ why not create something that helps us disconnect and dream ? ” ' all you have to do is find a place to nap , slip on the @entity64 and away you go			2
' whether it 's a noisy bedfellow , restless children , worrying about work or one too many late - night coffees , long - term lack of sleep now afflicts one in three @entity71			1
in fact , last year 's @entity72 found that poor slumberers are three times as likely to have trouble concentrating and twice as likely to have relationship problems and suffer low moods as good sleepers			2
pillow talk : @entity0 catches up on some shut - eye while on a bus as the type who wakes if there 's a glimmer of light coming through the shutters and whose boyfriend snores like a train , there 's little i would n't do for an extra 40 winks during the day			1
so , buoyed by the promise of 45 minutes shut - eye on my commute to work , i place an order for the £ 65 @entity33 - so - called because once it 's on , you are ' buried ' away from the outside world like an ostrich burying its head in the sand			1
all the pillows are handmade in @entity106 and it 's obvious a lot of love has gone into the product			2
mine arrives with its own carry bag emblazoned with the words ' @entity114 : dreams are today 's answers to @entity118 's questions '			2
the pillow is , in fact , more of a helmet , albeit one made from ultra-soft jersey padded out with ' smart micro balls ' which are similar to beanbag filling but much more fine			0
this means you can slump against the side of			0
well , just about anywhere , and not feel the vibrations from the train , bus or plane			0
despite its size , it 's as light as helium and the micro balls are coated in a special silicone , meaning they do n't make a beanbag-esque noise when you lean against them			0
once squashed down , my @entity33 just about fits in my ( admittedly sizeable ) handbag and i trundle along to start my commute			1
jumping on the bus , i leg it up to the top deck and into a much - coveted seat by the window , upon which i can rest my weary head			1
bingo ! i get out the pillow , cast a nervous glance around and pull it on			0
' as the type who wakes if there 's a glimmer of light coming through the shutters and whose boyfriend snores like a train , there 's little i would n't do for an extra 40 winks during the day			0
' i may not be able to see a thing , but i know i look daft - my boyfriend compared me to an alien when i tried it on at home			1
thankfully , anyone who has ever lived in or visited the capital can testify that @entity173 are n't fazed by anything			0
you could walk down the street barefoot in the snow and no one would blink an eye			0
after the faint sounds of a few sniggers fade away , my fellow passengers go back to playing @entity183 on their phones , leaving me free to nab the first of the day 's power - naps			1
who 's silly now , eh ? shrouded from the outside world , i find my new headgear luxuriously soft and toasty			0
despite the enclosed nature of the thing , the @entity33 is n't at all claustrophobic as it 's not tight			1
and because it 's physically wrapped around your head , it 's not going to do that pesky thing that a regular pillow does when you 're using it sitting up , i.e. falling away every time you adjust your position , leaving you crick - necked , angry and no less tired			1
indeed , it 's so comfortable and quiet inside one , there 's a real danger you could drift off and miss your stop			0
roused by the alarm on my phone as my 45 - minute journey nears its end , i alight feeling refreshed , if a little silly			1
there 's no way around it : this gizmo will ruin your hairdo			0
but on the upside , if you 're tired enough to be wearing it , it 's probable you did n't put too much effort into your barnet that morning anyway			0
after a morning in the office feeling a little more alert than normal , i donned the @entity33 again at @entity222 after my lunchtime bowl of soup - this time , popping my hands in the two holes either side of the helmet that allow you to keep your mitts nice and warm while you rest , face down , on a flat surface			1
embarrassing : @entity0 dons the pillow at a @entity222 , amusing the man sitting next to her i think it embarrassed the man sitting next to me more than it did me			0
but , being a @entity42 , he did n't say a word			0
after work , and a final five - minute snooze while waiting for a friend at the @entity239 ( where my napping was interrupted by a security guard who looked most unamused , asking me to move along ) , i headed off to take the train home			1
people at @entity247 were a little more inquisitive about my headwear			0
one lady asked me , in all seriousness , if i was wearing a dog 's bodywarmer over my head			1
but even the inevitable signalling delays did n't get me down			0
they just meant another opportunity to grab 40 winks , this time while standing			0
besides the embarrassment factor , there are other downsides to the @entity64			0
it 's warm , verging on the too warm			0
while it would be good for planes , sofas or in well - ventilated areas , wrapping a mini-beanbag around your face is not comfortable in a packed , sweaty train carriage			1
but , eager to respond to customer feedback , @entity38 and @entity272 's firm , @entity273 , recently unveiled the @entity274			0
constructed of the same jersey and polystyrene balls , this version wraps around your eyes and ears only in a @entity282 - style headband , leaving your neck and the top of your head exposed to the elements			1
you may look as if you 're living in a virtual reality world while it 's on your head , but the @entity289 can , at least , be pulled down and worn around the neck as a scarf when you 're awake , and is much less bulky			2
mock all you like , but a month after its launch , the company have 1,400 orders worth almost £ 50,000 , so they 're obviously onto something			2
after all , when you 're that tired , and a pillow is this comfortable , who gives a damn what you look like ? an adult size costs £ 65 , children £ 50 ( studiobananathings.com / buy - ostrich - pillow ) .			1

long term lack of sleep affects one in three @entity71
power - napping improves productivity by 34 *%* - *cue* the @entity33
it a £ 65 sound - proofed cushion that completely engulfs your head
much to the amusement of passerby , @entity316 gives it a spin
