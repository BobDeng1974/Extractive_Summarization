he will be at home when the awards are handed out rather than standing on stage , holding a memento that recognises his supreme efforts			0
cast a glance at the @entity9 nominees and , in a flash , you will see that one big name is notable by its absence			2
while @entity15 , the @entity17 and @entity18 midfielder , and the mercurial @entity19 make the 23 - man list ahead , @entity14 misses the cut			1
no matter that @entity14 scored 31 goals in the @entity23 , was crowned both the @entity25 and @entity24 , and came within a whisker of leading @entity27 to the title , when the prizes are distributed next january , @entity14 will be nowhere to be seen			1
@entity14 beams as he poses with the 2014 @entity25 player of the year award back in april we all know why			1
the @entity32 , @entity33 versus @entity34 in @entity35 ; as his dream is slipping away , the fuses in his mind short - circuit and he bites @entity40			1
the incident becomes front page news around the globe and a four - month ban follows			0
forget that bite on @entity46 - after which he was still named in the shortlist for 2013 award			1
this was on a much bigger stage			0
from that point of view , @entity14 must take his medicine			2
when you bring the game into disrepute in such extraordinary circumstances , you have to expect the backlash and punishments that follow			0
@entity14 , in this respect , is his own worst enemy			2
@entity14 's year took a significant turn for the worse when he opted to bite @entity40 in july but , for all that , you can not help feel the 23 - man list to be crowned the best footballer on the planet lacks sheen without his presence			1
it is sad , in some respects , because @entity14 ’s talents are so magnificent that he easily rubs shoulders with those who are in the running			2
this is not to say he would have won the @entity9			2
bookmakers rightly have @entity78 as the long odds - on favourite , having helped @entity81 win the @entity82 and @entity83 with more goals than you could imagine possible			1
if he had not bitten @entity40 , though , @entity14 should have made the podium			1
he was glorious to watch last season , a force of nature with dynamite in boots , someone who could not have done any more to lift @entity27 over a line they had not crossed for 24 years			1
@entity14 's form for @entity27 last season earned him a £ 75million move to @entity99 ‘ rehabilitation is something we respect in this country , ’ @entity27 manager @entity100 said on the night the @entity101 honoured @entity14			1
‘ he had a difficult time but once the power of @entity27 convinced him to stay and he concentrated on his football , he was incredible			0
’ that last word was not used lightly nor was it hyperbole			0
a ticket to @entity112 last season guaranteed entertainment and supporters went with the giddy anticipation of wondering what @entity14 was going to produce for his next trick			2
how about four goals , including a 35 - yard volley , against @entity120 ? what about the strike against @entity123 before @entity124 that had the trajectory of a boomerang ? or the dispossessing of @entity128 and subsequent 60 - yard sprint that ended with @entity27 ’s final goal in the 4 - 0 win over @entity132 ? @entity14 celebrates one of his four goals scored against @entity120 at @entity112 in december 2013 the @entity33 celebrates wildly after scoring against @entity132 in january as @entity27 won 4 - 0 there were hat - tricks at home , hat - tricks on the road and , in some ways , one of his most spectacular moments was one that failed to end up with a goal – think of the volley from @entity146 ’s corner against @entity147 that smashed against the crossbar from 30 yards			1
‘ from day one he was a phenomenal in training every day and in the games , ’ @entity146 reflected			0
‘ he would have been deadly for us in the @entity82			0
there ’s no getting away from that			0
everyone knows what i think of him			0
he ’ll cause mayhem in the @entity82 with @entity99			0
’ @entity14 had some highlights reel			0
cast your eye over the @entity9 list again and , though there is no arguing about the quality of those selected , a number of players did not reach the levels the man from @entity167 scaled during @entity27 ’s bid for glory			1
a tearful @entity78 picks up last year 's award in @entity171 - he is odds - on favourite to win it again without that bite , he would , quite probably , have been standing shoulder - to - shoulder with @entity78 and , in all likelihood , @entity176 or @entity177 , the totem at the head of @entity181 ’s charge to @entity182 and the @entity82 final			1
instead , when football ’s gliteratti assemble in @entity171 next january , he will be in the shadows			0
he will know it should have so been different .			0

@entity14 named @entity25 and @entity101 player of the year last season in @entity191
@entity14 scored 31 goals in the @entity23 for @entity27
@entity33 bit @entity34 's @entity40 during @entity32 and was banned for four months by @entity195
@entity14 omitted from @entity195 's 23 - man list for the 2014 @entity9 award
@entity14 would have been among favourites to win had he not bitten @entity40
