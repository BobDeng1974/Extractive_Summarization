avoided punishment : the @entity1 will not take disciplinary action against @entity4 presenter @entity3 @entity4 presenter @entity3 has escaped disciplinary action over his alleged use of the n - word while filming the hit @entity1 series			1
in unaired footage the 54 - year - old presenter was heard reciting the rhyme ' eeny , meeny , miny , mo ' before apparently muttering ' catch a n * * * * * by his toe '			1
despite the media storm surrounding the video , which was leaked in may , the @entity15 has ruled out taking further action against @entity3 as the material had not been broadcast			1
several viewers have complained to the @entity15 and asked it to review its decision not to take their complaints any further - after its senior complaints adviser said there was no case for the controversial presenter to answer			2
in a report published today , the @entity30 and @entity31 agreed that the ' incident did not engage editorial standards as the material had not been broadcast ' and noted the @entity1 had left @entity3 ' in no doubt about how seriously we view this '			1
it stated : ' the panel concluded that there was no reasonable prospect of success for an appeal			0
' shortly after the tape was made public , the @entity1 put @entity3 on a final warning and he wrote in his newspaper column that he believed he would be sacked by the broadcaster if he made another offensive remark			1

the tv presenter told his 3.3million @entity52 followers that he had made every effort to make sure he did not use the slur , but realised it might have sounded as though he had			0
in the video message posted on his official @entity52 account he said : ' a couple of years ago i recorded an item for @entity4 , in which i quoted the rhyme @entity65 , @entity67 , @entity68			2
' the full rushes show that i did three takes			0
in two i mumbled where the offensive word would normally occur and in the third , i replaced it all together with the word " teacher "			2
' now when i viewed this footage , several weeks later , i realised that in one of the mumbled versions , if you listen very carefully with the sound turned right up , it did appear that i 'd actually used the word i was trying to obscure			2
' ordinarily i do n't respond to newspaper allegations , but on this occasion i feel i must make an exception			0
' a couple of years ago i recorded an item for @entity4 , in which i quoted the rhyme @entity65 , @entity67 , @entity68			2

' and i did everything in my power to make sure that that version did not appear in the programme that was transmitted			0
' in fact , i have here the note i sent at the time to the production office			2
' and it says , " i did n't use the n - word here but i 've just listened through my headphones and it sounds like i did			1
is there another take that we could use ? " ' please be assured i did everything in my power to not use that word			0
' and as i 'm sitting here begging your forgiveness for that fact that obviously my efforts were n't quite good enough			0

' we have made it absolutely clear to him the standards the @entity1 expects on - air and off			1
' we have left him in no doubt about how seriously we view this			0
' it was alleged that mr @entity3 uttered the n - word during filming of the third episode of @entity4 series 19 as the star reviewed the £ 25,000 @entity182 and the @entity182 - which costs around the same amount			1
