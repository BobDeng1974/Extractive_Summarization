under fire : author @entity1 sparked international outrage this week for saying men who watch child porn are sentenced too harshly while defending a @entity6 friend caught on serious charges when @entity1 sparked outrage around the world by saying that men who view child pornography were being unfairly treated , the best - selling author had the case of a ‘ law school buddy ’ in mind			1
he described a man who , under the influence of heavy drinking , had downloaded pictures from a website labeled ’ 16 - year - old wannabe hookers or something ’			0
caught in a police sting , he was jailed for three years , said @entity1			1
‘ we ’ve gone nuts with this incarceration ’ , intoned the master of courtroom thrillers			0
unfortunately for @entity1 , however , the man on whom he reportedly based his controversial argument insists the author was completely wrong			1
@entity33 , whose application to be reinstated as a lawyer was backed by @entity1 after he was disbarred for downloading child pornography from the internet , told the @entity38 he fully deserved the 18 months he received in prison			1
‘ i did something wrong and i do n’t have a bit of resentment about the way i was treated , ’ said @entity33 , formerly one of @entity6 ’s top criminal lawyers			1
‘ it ’s illegal and should be punished			2
if it ’s a crime , it ’s a crime			0
there ’s a violation of the right of privacy involved			0
there ’s people now who , because of the internet , who are making child pornography so they can share it across the internet			2
there are good reasons for it to be illegal and punished			2
’ he added : ‘ they were just images that i looked at and deleted			0
it consumed about five minutes of my life and it was a terrible mistake			0
i spend my days now helping other people			0
’ @entity1 has not confirmed widespread reports that he was referring to 59 - year - old @entity33 but the similarities with his case are glaring			1
like the ‘ buddy ’ outlined by @entity1 to illustrate his point , @entity33 became a heavy drinker who downloaded child pornography only to be arrested and jailed following a ‘ sting ’ operation set up by @entity74 police			1
@entity33 , from @entity76 , @entity6 , said @entity1 had contacted him after his remarks provoked anger to assure him he had been referring to someone else			1
@entity33 , who is back practicing as a personal injury lawyer but no longer works for his prestigious family practice , admitted he had ‘ paid a heavy price ’ for breaking the law but had ‘ moved on ’			1
he was released from prison in 1999 after serving 15 months of his sentence but the scandal ended his marriage			0
online reaction : many commented that @entity1 's claims do n't take into account the victims of sexual abuse involved with child pornography he said he was now ‘ happily remarried ’ with a son at university			2
‘ i decided to pick myself up , make the best of my life and be a better husband and better father , a better person and help other people , ’ he said			0
@entity1 , the author of bestsellers such as @entity105 , @entity106 and the client , was forced to apologise for his remarks in a newspaper interview			2
outrage : fans quickly reacted to the controversial comments made by @entity1 , who is currently promoting his latest book , legal thriller @entity114 , which will be released next week author @entity1 , wife @entity116 and family attend the @entity119 opening night of a time to kill at @entity121 on october 20 , 2013 in @entity122 he insisted his comments ‘ were in no way intended to show sympathy for those conviced of sex crimes , especially the sexual molestation of children			1
’ but compounding @entity1 ’s embarrassment , it emerges that he grossly understated the extent of his friend ’s offences			2
far from merely looking at pictures of 16 - year - olds – which would n’t anyway be illegal under @entity6 law - @entity33 was accused of accessing sexually explicit images of children who in some cases were younger than 12			1
not only did he download them but he also sent some 13 images to an undercover police officer in @entity74 , resulting in a conviction for ‘ sending and receiving ’ child pornography			1
despite the seriousness of his crimes , @entity33 agrees with @entity1 on one point , he said			1
he does n’t believe that anyone who looks at child pornography is automatically a paedophile and insisted he was n’t one himself			0
‘ there ’s no doctor in the world who would say because someone looks at something on the internet , that makes them a paedophile			0
‘ the pictures [ he looked at ] were disgusting – it ’s like looking at the pictures of a horrible murder scene , which i ’ve also done			0
but it does n’t make you a murderer , ’ he said			0
‘ but they were grotesque to me and i understand why it ’s illegal and should be			0

*novelist* and lawyer @entity1 , 59 , sparked outrage this week by claiming men are wrongly sent to prison for watching child porn

the friend has now been named as @entity6 lawyer @entity185
@entity33 was arrested in 1997 sending 13 sexually explicit photos of underage girls to an undercover agent
