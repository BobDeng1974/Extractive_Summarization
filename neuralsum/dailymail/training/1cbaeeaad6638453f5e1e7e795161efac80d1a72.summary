the stunt was captured on hidden camera to promote the release of @entity47 , a horror film due out in the @entity48 next month			1
the trick involved replacing the standard mirrors inside the salon with special two - way mirrors , which the actress then sat behind			0
staff also put a horror film on the television in the store to make the atmosphere a little more tense			1
