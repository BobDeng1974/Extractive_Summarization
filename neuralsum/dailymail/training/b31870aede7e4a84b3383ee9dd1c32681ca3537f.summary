by @entity0 last updated at 4:38 pm on 27th september 2011 legal history was made today when a @entity3 patient had his appeal against being locked up heard in public			1
the mental health tribunal for @entity7 , 52 , who has been diagnosed with a personality disorder , offered a rare glimpse into the usually hidden world of the famous high - security psychiatric institution			1
members of the press were given full access to the proceedings , which despite the sensitive mental health issues being discussed , were reportable for the first time			0
secure : a patient at @entity3 ( pictured ) has made legal history by publicly appealing against detention mr @entity7 also attended the landmark hearing in a basement room of @entity24 in @entity25 , central @entity26 , becoming the first psychiatric patient to seek his freedom under the gaze of the public eye			1
after being held in secure hospitals for 25 years following a conviction for two counts of attempted wounding in september 1986 , he successfully argued that his case should be considered at an open hearing after saying he wanted to expose alleged failings in the system			1
the tribunal panel was told he did not think there was anything wrong with him and believed his discharge was ' in the moral public interest '			1
@entity44 , representing mr @entity7 , pointed out that he had not killed anybody and argued that ' to spend 25 years as a result of these incidents seems disproportionate '			1
she also suggested her client had not been properly treated for the post-traumatic stress disorder he was said to have suffered in the wake of his difficult childhood			0
the three - man panel heard he had a ' sense he is a victim of the system ' and that he ' desperately does n't want to be ( in custody ) and is angry at being there '			0
this anger could account for some of his behaviour within the hospital , his lawyer told the hearing			0
but dr @entity63 , mr @entity7 's responsible clinician , argued that the patient remained a risk to the public and to himself			1
he said : ' mr @entity7 would struggle to live independently ' adding ' i think it would be inevitable there would be an incident of violence			2
' and he told ms @entity44 there were other patients who had been detained at @entity3 for similar or even lesser offences than mr @entity7 's			1
he told the panel mr @entity7 had suffered deprivation and neglect during childhood and had later reported being abused and using cannabis , cocaine and amphetamines			1
the patient now believed he was being persecuted and had sought the public hearing in part because he feared mental health hearings were not impartial , the doctor said			2
' i believe he suffers from paranoid psychosis , ' he said , adding that mr @entity7 had a ' constant preoccupation with a conspiracy he feels he is the victim of '			2
@entity3 psychiatric hospital is home to some of @entity96 's most dangerous criminals , including @entity97 ( left ) and @entity98 outlining the patient 's behaviour , he described him as abusive and threatening towards staff at @entity3 and argued that ' the evidence is that mr @entity7 would not be able to cope with a normal environment '			2
mr @entity7 , however , could be released in about two years ' time if he complied with his treatment , the doctor estimated			1
not all the doctors who have seen mr @entity7 share that opinion about his condition however , with another medic reporting that he showed no current psychotic symptoms , the tribunal heard			2
@entity114 , counsel for @entity3 , asked : ' why would mr @entity7 have confidence if the doctors are all thinking different things ? ' but dr @entity63 said : ' we are not a precise science			0
we do n't have a blood test or an x-ray that would give you a diagnosis			0
' he added : ' i would never be in a position to make any machiavellian decisions			0
it would have to be done with a second opinion			0
' an estimated 100,000 mental health tribunals have been held in the past seven years , but of these there were only 10 applications for the hearing to be held in public			0
only one previous application for an open session was granted , and this was later withdrawn			0
@entity3 , in @entity139 , @entity140 , is home to some of @entity96 's most dangerous criminals , including @entity97 and serial killer @entity98 .			0

@entity7 , 52 , has been in secure hospitals for 25 years
he was convicted of two counts of attempted wounding in september 1986
a tribunal panel was told he believed his discharge was ' in the moral public interest '
