a dangerous strain of @entity1 has led to at least two children needing dialysis in hospital – and left angry parents asking why authorities failed to sound the alert early enough			2
the rare form of the bacteria , apparently originating in @entity10 , has struck 11 people , including five children , with seven developing kidney problems which could be permanent			1
one three - year - old girl , from @entity15 in the county , is battling the infection in hospital after being struck down last week			2
yet while the outbreak began in july , @entity29 ( @entity30 ) only began raising any alarm this week			1
it is yet to identify the source of the potentially fatal infection of @entity1 but has ruled out a @entity25 branch of restaurant chain @entity37 ’s where three victims dined in two separate groups before being struck down			1
yesterday , @entity30 contacted the families of all the victims asking relatives to give blood tests in an attempt to establish the origin of the outbreak			0
one of those who needed dialysis is @entity20 , now 21 months			1
@entity49 , three , also fell ill with @entity22 after eating at the same @entity51 's restaurant , which has been cleared of any blame by investigators @entity49 's mother @entity54 ( pictured ) also feared her son could die after finding him fitting in the middle of the night he spent four weeks in @entity57 , much of it in intensive care , and required multiple blood transfusions			1
he was at one stage left blind for ten days and had to be put into a coma for six days because it was dangerous for him to try to breathe			2
although @entity20 survived the ordeal , he was left blind for 10 days and his kidneys may never work properly again eventually he was diagnosed with the @entity1 strain , although all the diagnoses took a long time because the strain has never been found since records began in 1994			1
@entity20 ’s mother @entity71 , 25 , from @entity25 , said : ‘ the whole family thought he was going to die			1
he was totally traumatised and went through hell			0
it is ridiculous @entity29 did n’t warn people what was going on and work harder to find the source			1
’ @entity54 ’s son @entity49 , three , was in the same hospital as @entity20 , also needing dialysis and spending time in intensive care			1
he is now home after nine weeks in two hospitals but is still on a nasal drip and has permanently damaged kidneys			0
the family fear he may be in need of a kidney transplant			2
miss @entity54 , 26 , from @entity25 , said : ‘ the day after @entity49 ’s birthday in july he suddenly got very ill. first he was sick			1
then he began passing blood			0
‘ at first doctors told us it was probably gastroenteritis			0
it was only when he started leaking blood permanently they said they ’d have to admit him to hospital			0
then he got violently sick – and an x-ray and scan showed his kidneys were affected and he had to go on dialysis			0
he had to be switched to another hospital in @entity57 and stay there for five weeks			0
‘ he had fits in the middle of one night as well , his eyes were rolling , i thought he was dying , and i was screaming ‘ ‘ wo n’t someone help my baby ? ” he was unrecognisable			2
’ @entity20 , now two , was the first to pick up the rare strain of @entity22 that has hospitalised 11 people in @entity10 since july @entity49 ’s aunt , @entity116 , was then struck down by the same strain of @entity1 and was hospitalised			1
miss @entity54 is angry that @entity30 did not start publicising the outbreak until this week			0
she said : ‘ i ’m devastated that other children are now suffering – and feel that had @entity29 taken @entity49 ’s case more seriously in the first place , and put out more warnings , fewer people could have been affected			1
’ a spokesman for @entity30 said that the people affected by the strain had been struck over a lengthy period , and that while all had passed through @entity10 , not all were from there , so it took some time to pull the facts together			1
she said : ‘ all those affected and their close contacts are being followed up and further investigations are taking place to determine the likely source			2
’ cleared : three people who have fallen ill with @entity22 ate at @entity23 before they were hospitalised , but the restaurant has been given a clean bill of health @entity22 or @entity1 , is a group of bacteria that live in the intestines of animals and humans			1
many strains are harmless , but some can cause serious health problems			0
about 35,000 people are struck down by different forms of @entity1 infection every year			0
many cases are mild , such as urinary tract infections , but 1,000 a year are hit by @entity1 food poisoning which can be very serious , particularly to children and the elderly			0
the most common serious @entity1 strain in @entity157 is @entity158			0
symptoms include severe diarrhoea , stomach cramps and fever			0
infections can cause serious complications such as potentially fatal kidney problems or brain damage			1
the bug releases toxins which can affect blood vessels – leading to fits and attacking the kidneys			0
it may also harm the heart			0
infection is spread by consuming food or water contaminated with the bacteria , or through contact with infected people or farm animals			1
a severe outbreak at a petting farm in @entity183 affected 76 young children in 2009 , ten of them suffering long - term effects			2
the @entity157 ’s largest @entity1 food poisoning outbreak killed 21 people in @entity189 in 1996 .			2
