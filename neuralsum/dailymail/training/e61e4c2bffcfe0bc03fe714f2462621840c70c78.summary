by @entity0 published : 11:05 est , 5 march 2013 updated : 13:51 est , 5 march 2013 it may look like an attacker from a 1980s computer game , but @entity4 today revealed this photo taken by @entity6 of a massive cluster of galaxies two billion light years from @entity9 is an optical illusion			1
called @entity12 68 , the object is really a mirage created by the gravitational field of a foreground cluster of galaxies warping space and distorting the background images of more distant galaxies			1
this effect , called gravitational lensing , can make multiple mirror image copies of the light coming from a far - flung galaxy			1
@entity12 68 , pictured here in infrared light , is a galaxy cluster			0
@entity6 operators were stunned to see what looks like a space invader ' character - but in reality the object is really a mirage the image looks uncannily similar to the alien from the @entity38 computer game ' the gravitational field surrounding this massive cluster of galaxies , @entity12 68 , acts as a natural lens in space to brighten and magnify the light coming from very distant background galaxies , ' said @entity4			1
' like a fun house mirror , lensing creates a fantasy landscape of arc - like images and mirror images of background galaxies			0
' the foreground cluster is two billion light - years away , and the lensed images come from galaxies far behind it			2
' in this photo , the image of a spiral galaxy at upper left has been stretched and mirrored into a shape similar to that of a simulated alien from the classic 1970s computer game @entity38 ! ' this image was taken in infrared light by @entity6 ’s @entity66 , and combined with near - infrared observations from @entity6 ’s @entity68			0
in this @entity6 photo a background spiral galaxy is warped into an image that resembles a cartoon of a simulated space invader			2
the foreground massive cluster , called @entity12 68 , lies two billion light - years away			2
the brightened and stretched lensed images come from galaxies far behind it ' these distorted images of distant galaxies are a particularly fine example of this phenomenon , ' said the @entity82			0
' in the middle of the image are a large number of galaxies stretched out into almost straight streaks of light that look like shooting stars			0
' meanwhile , just above and to the right of the large , bright elliptical galaxy in the upper left of the image is a spiral galaxy whose apparent shape has been stretched and mirror - morphed into the shape of an alien from the classic 1970s computer game @entity38 ! ' a second , less distorted image of the same galaxy appears to the left of the elliptical galaxy			0
' spot the space invader : the ' clean ' @entity6 image was taken in infrared light by @entity6 's @entity66 , and combined with near - infrared observations from @entity6 's @entity68 for surveys			1

the effect , called gravitational lensing , is used to *improve* @entity6 's view of far away galaxies
