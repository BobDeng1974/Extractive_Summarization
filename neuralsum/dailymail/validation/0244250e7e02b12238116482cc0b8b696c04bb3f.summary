football supporters ' chiefs have called for proportionality in punishments for fans convicted of offences during saturday 's @entity7 quarter - final clash between @entity8 and @entity9			1
home supporters twice invaded the pitch during their side 's 2 - 0 victory over the @entity9 at @entity14 , while seats were thrown from the upper tier of the stand holding visiting contingent on to the spectators below			1
@entity9 boss @entity20 later voiced his support for lifetime bans for anyone convicted of throwing seats as both clubs vowed to take strong action against offenders , with @entity28 and the @entity29 also launching investigations			1
police clash with unruly fans in scenes reminiscent of the of the 1970s following @entity8 's @entity7 defeat of @entity9 @entity9 players look concerned as @entity8 fans invade the pitch at the end of their @entity7 quarter - final @entity8 fans celebrate by racing on to the pitch following their 2 - 0 victory over @entity9 at @entity14 insufficient numbers of police and stewards attempted to deal with the hundreds who invaded the field of play police attempt to halt fans who ran on to the pitch after @entity8 booked their place in the semi-finals of the @entity7 @entity8 fans leap over hoardings at the final whistle - while the decision to stage the game at 5.30pm is being questioned however , @entity56 , chair of the @entity57 , urged the authorities to make the punishment fit the crime			1
mr @entity56 said : ' if people do something wrong , they must expect to be sanctioned			1
i think talk of lifetime bans is over the top , i 'm afraid			1
' are we really saying that in 50 years ' time , one of these young people - if it was young people - could n't take their grandchildren to a football match ? i do n't think so			2
' you have got to have punishments which are proportionate to the offence			2
the law at the moment has a maximum 10 - year period for a football banning order , so it would be rather odd for people to start talking about lifetime bans			1
' you could go to prison for a serious violent assault at a football match and the courts might give you a 10 - year football banning order , so are we seriously saying that someone who damages a seat gets a lifetime ban ? ' we have got to retain a sense of proportionality about all of this			2
' @entity9 manager @entity20 had described the @entity100 fixture as ' tasty ' ahead of the game @entity9 goalkeeper @entity102 is mocked by an @entity8 fan following the home side 's second goal the @entity9 goalkeeper attempts to make his way safely off the field following the full - time whistle scorer @entity111 is mobbed by team - mates @entity112 and @entity114 but a supporter also joined in after the goal fans sing and chant on the pitch following @entity8 's win during what has been a disappointing season @entity8 players @entity123 ( centre ) and @entity114 ( right ) are mobbed by fans after the game goalscorer @entity127 claims fans nicked his captain 's armband as well as his left boot during the invasion the pitch invasions , one of which came shortly before the final whistle and the other after it , divided opinion with some onlookers claiming it represented little more than a collective outpouring of joy for the @entity8 supporters			1
and that is a view with which @entity56 has some sympathy			2
he said : ' it 's very important to retain a sense of perspective here			0
as far as i could see , this was a celebratory invasion not an aggressive one			0
' there is a distinction between aggressive invasions , where people are trying to attack somebody else , and celebratory ones			0
' we would certainly advise fans not to do that			0
it is a criminal offence so you always run the risk of ending up in court if you are not careful			0
it 's not advisable , but actually it 's not the biggest issue in the world , i would say about that one			0
' if there was criminal damage to some seats , that 's quite wrong and , again , anybody who is identified as being responsible for that must expect to receive some sanction			0
@entity9 forward @entity176 is escorted off the field after a row with an @entity8 fan an @entity8 supporter is escorted off by stewards after invading the pitch before full - time @entity111 is crowded by @entity8 supporters after scoring his goal in the 2 - 0 victory @entity8 manager @entity186 admitted he could understand the fans ' emotions after the victory ' it 's clearly not defensible to do that , but every saturday night in pubs and clubs up and down the country people damage things			1
it 's wrong and it 's deplorable , but one incident at one football match when these kind of things happen very regularly in pubs and clubs on a saturday night up and down the country gets blown up out of all proportion			0
' sometimes , people misbehave , at football matches , in pubs , in clubs , in the street or wherever , and that 's deplorable			0
but let 's not castigate football fans for just one incident			0
' the actual incidence of disorder at football matches has hugely declined in recent years , so that 's a cause for celebration			0
' nevertheless , it proved a difficult weekend for @entity219 football with police , who made 17 arrests , also investigating a disturbance at the @entity225 pub before the @entity8 game , while a 44 - year - old @entity228 fan is critically ill in hospital after being attacked on his way to the railway station following the @entity233 ' 2 - 2 @entity232 draw at @entity234			1
@entity56 , who wished the unnamed man a full recovery , said : ' whether they are a football fan or whether they are not , it 's totally unacceptable to assault people to any extent , but particularly to that extent , so obviously if they are caught presumably they will be brought before the courts and the law will take its course , which is entirely appropriate			2
' football fans should never be above the law			0
' the pitch at @entity14 can barely be seen as supporters cover practically every blade of grass @entity8 fans celebrate victory on the pitch after what has been a highlight of a lacklustre season @entity8 supporter @entity257 needed his hair cut and wound glued together on saturday night			1

@entity8 moved into the @entity7 semi-finals with a 2 - 0 defeat of @entity9 at @entity14 on saturday
@entity8 and @entity9 fans behaved *irresponsibly* by invading the pitch , *ripping* out seats and *abusing* players
@entity8 face the prospect of a fine in the region of *Â£* *100,000* for failing to *adequately* control hundreds of fans
@entity9 boss @entity20 called for lifetime bans for anyone convicted of throwing seats
but @entity57 chief @entity56 has called for punishments to fit the crime
goal scorer @entity127 claims he lost a boot and was *bitten* during the *chaotic* scenes
