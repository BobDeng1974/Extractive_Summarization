@entity1 ’s fastest snowboarder has released a death - defying video showing him being towed behind a commercial aircraft in @entity4			1
@entity5 , who is on the @entity1 @entity6 , reached speeds of 78 miles per hour during his world ’s first feat at the @entity10 in @entity4			1
the inspiration for the stunt came from an old black and white photo of a skier being taxied by an aircraft in @entity16 over 100 years ago , and as a result @entity5 wanted to complete the feat at the same resort			2
the video footage was released following photos showing the 22 - year - old 's feat completed earlier this month			1
@entity5 had hoped to perform the stunt on the frozen lake of @entity16 , but after the ice was considered too unstable the operation was moved to the nearby airport			2
additionally , the initial plan also featured the plane taking off and pulling @entity5 along while flying low , but again this was deemed too dangerous			0
in order to complete the stunt a long strip of snow - covered grass running parallel to the runway had to be piste - bashed			0
@entity5 , 22 , became the first person to snowboard while being towed to the back of a commercial aircraft in @entity4 the snowboarder was fixed to the @entity43 aircraft via rope and a wooden handle , which he used to hold on as he was dragged behind @entity5 attempted the stunt on a chilly , sunny day at the @entity10 near @entity16 , @entity4 a long strip of snow - covered grass parallel to the runway was prepared for @entity51 to snowboard along at @entity10 timings also had to be considered as private aircraft were landing and taking off throughout the afternoon			1
towed by the @entity43 aircraft with nothing more than a wakeboard cord attached to a wooden handle , @entity5 was unable to communicate with @entity4 pilot @entity58 for the duration of the stunt			1
further complicating the already dangerous endeavour was the fact that @entity5 was unable to snowboard directly behind the plane and instead was forced to board on its right - hand side			0
as the plane accelerated down the runway the rope slack tightened and @entity5 began speeding along in a remarkably straight and controlled manner			0
due to safety concerns , @entity5 was unable to snowboard directly behind the aircraft , so had to position himself off to the right as the plane accelerated , the rope slack tightened and @entity51 sped up along the snowy strip reaching speeds of 78mph onlookers held their breath as the aircraft powered down the tarmac , praying he would n't crash during the dangerous stunt onlookers held their breath as the aircraft powered down the runway , praying that he would not catch an edge and crash to the tarmac			1
keeping calm and composed @entity51 continued on safely through to the end before effortlessly skidding to a halt once letting go			0
and after completing one successful run , the adrenaline - junkie was keen to have another go			0
following his first successful run , @entity5 persuaded the pilot to allow him to complete two more for good measure after his third run , which reached speeds of 78mph , @entity5 celebrated with friends and family by giving his mum a big hug taking two more rides while hanging onto the aircraft , @entity51 eventually reached the impressive 78mph speed , much to the delight of his family and friends			2
an ecstatic @entity5 chatted with press after the event , adding that he 'd wished he 'd been able to go even faster – if the pilot had taken off – and hinted that there could be a follow up stunt in the future .			0
