@entity0 was stunned when @entity1 executed a textbook smash and grab — scoring an 86th - minute goal to deal @entity4 a first league defeat since the opening game of the season			1
only a tiny corner of @entity1 fans were united in song after a shot by @entity12 from distance was deflected off @entity14 and beyond @entity16 ’s outstretched arm			1
@entity16 had only been tested once before that			0
‘ we ’re staggered that we ’ve lost , ’ said @entity4 manager @entity18			1
‘ we did enough to win two or three games			1
except for not scoring a goal , we did everything right			2
i could n’t criticise anything			0

it ’s a cruel game			0
’ tempers spilled over after the final whistle with several players embroiled in a fracas			0
@entity1 manager @entity80 dragged 17 - year - old @entity81 , who was making his debut , away from a skirmish with @entity4 captain @entity14			1
‘ you do n’t see him picking on @entity29 , ’ said @entity80 afterwards , referring to his defender who is built like a rugby prop forward			0
‘ they pick on the little one			0
’ @entity18 turned toward the dugout , hands on his chest and head tilted to the skies in through the second half when @entity96 was denied , then @entity33 ’s follow - up shot was cleared on the line by a scrambling @entity31			0
he must have wondered what his side had to do to win this game			1
they played elegant football and tested keeper @entity26 several times but the @entity1 defence stood resolute			2

earlier @entity68 had disallowed a goal , probably correctly , for a push on @entity26 by @entity40 before @entity14 poked the ball into the net			0
@entity4 ’s best opportunity to establish a lead came after only three minutes when @entity33 played a tremendous ball to release @entity43			2
the striker had only the keeper to beat but his low shot to the left was palmed away by @entity26			0
@entity33 again found @entity43 in space soon after but he shot wide from distance			0
@entity1 , one of only five sides in @entity128 football still unbeaten this season , owe much of that record to experienced defensive duo @entity27 and @entity29 , who made several crucial tackles			1
‘ they were excellent , ’ said @entity80			0
the former @entity134 international striker said he was not considering promotion yet for @entity1			2
‘ if you look at the budget we have and the budget @entity4 have they are very different			2
i was playing two 17 - year - olds ( @entity50 and @entity55 )			0
at the moment i ’m enjoying @entity128 football and the whole of @entity1 is happy			2
’ @entity31 clears @entity33 's shot off the line during the match on tuesday night @entity1 goalkeeper @entity26 gives a thumbs - up with the scores level at 0 - 0			1

@entity1 captain @entity12 scored the only goal of the game late on , and it came very much against the run of play
the @entity156 remain unbeaten after 10 games this season , while the defeat *condemns* @entity4 to their first loss since *august* 10
@entity1 move up to *7th* after their win , one place outside the play - offs , while @entity4 remain top of the @entity167 despite the loss
