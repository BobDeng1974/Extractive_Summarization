by @entity0 @entity2 v @entity1 in @entity3 , two teams still without a point , but both determined to go out and make one			1
and for in - form @entity7 ? it was about putting their best foot forward for a peak - time @entity12 showdown that should turn out to be the most watched tv programme of the year so far			1
@entity14 was joined in their @entity16 studio by @entity17 , former @entity1 manager , @entity19 and @entity20			1
missing , and missed by his colleagues and the viewers alike , was @entity23 who had rushed back to the @entity25 following a disturbing break - in at his family home on tuesday evening			0
@entity39 was @entity28 , the ‘ come from nowhere ’ man who helped steer @entity1 to @entity41 before injury curtailed his @entity12 chances , whilst his namesake @entity38 was in that most current of hot seats , as @entity1 match co-commentator to the experienced @entity48			2
it is a role that he has done many times but scrutiny on performance would seem to have been ratcheted up in recent days with @entity55 ’s difficult @entity54 debut			1
@entity55 ’s @entity54 team - mates @entity57 and @entity58 , informed and confident , have impressed in co-commentary			1
good to see the engaging @entity59 joining @entity7 ’s @entity12 coverage and immediately adding that sense of curiosity and conflict that he so clearly enjoys			1
verbally sparring with @entity64 before like everybody else raving at @entity67 ’s wonder goal for @entity68			0
missing : @entity23 's presence was missed but @entity20 deputised for the @entity7 regular it has also been refreshing to hear both @entity72 and @entity73 express a fan ’s wonderment at being ‘ privileged ’ to be inside the famous @entity76			1
and often an unnecessary diversion , in this @entity12 the inspired choice of crowd shots has added genuine colour and carnival to the tv viewer ’s experience			0
they ’d be spoilt for choice again in @entity3			0
@entity7 opened the programme with the news we all feared - and expected			1
@entity89 in , not 100 per cent , but on the pitch			2
and that drove the opening thoughts of the experts			0
barmy army : crowd shots have added carnival and colour to the viewing experience of this @entity12 how fit is fit ? how dangerous is dangerous ? @entity28 still thought fit or nearly fit he was a barrel load of trouble : ' he could nutmeg a mermaid			0
' ' this is knock - out football and no mistake , ' @entity14 offered			0
not absolutely true but you knew what he meant			0
and we all felt it			0
and in a memorable sequence @entity1 players spoke directly to camera of what it meant to them to play for their country			2
simple , touching and genuine			0
‘ you ’re not supposed to enjoy watching @entity1 in the @entity12 , you know that by now			2
’ @entity48 and @entity28 , @entity38 , that is , both seasoned @entity1 watchers , were off and running			2
@entity1 started well , a @entity119 free - kick went close countered with a shot from @entity121			1
‘ a good spell for @entity1 ’ @entity48 offered a little later and it was nearly capped with a goal from @entity119			1
then in the 39th minute @entity89 scores a brilliant header			2
fit or not fit , he knows where the goal is			0
‘ it just had to be @entity89			0
’ we sort of knew it would be , and @entity89 's second - the winner - just confirmed that			1
heartbreaker : @entity89 gave @entity2 the lead in the first half in the @entity135 big moment : @entity119 equalises for @entity1 in a period of sustained pressure against @entity2 killer blow : but @entity89 stole the show with @entity2 's winner after a @entity143 error late on			1

@entity7 *repeated* their good form with the year 's most watched tv programme
@entity148 was under scrutiny after *criticism* of @entity55
@entity1 lose out 2 - 1 with two goals from @entity153 's @entity89
