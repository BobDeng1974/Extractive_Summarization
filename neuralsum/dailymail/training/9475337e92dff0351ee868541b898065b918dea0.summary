by @entity0 mosquito traps have been set up at motorway service stations because motorists returning from the @entity4 could be carrying home a deadly species			1
the @entity8 tiger mosquito , which can bite 50 times in 15 minutes and carries the life - threatening dengue fever , yellow and @entity13 fevers , hides in caravans , camping trailers and motorhomes			1
it has been spreading north from southern @entity18 and experts believe it could soon establish in the @entity21			2
deadly species : the @entity23 ( pictured ) , which can bite 50 times in 15 minutes and carries the life - threatening dengue fever , yellow and @entity13 fevers , hides in caravans , trailers and motorhomes the traps have been installed on the main routes from the @entity31 ferry ports and the @entity33 terminal			1
they resemble black plant pots and contain water to attract the insects			1
a few leaves are inserted and a small polystyrene square placed on top of the water			2
the dark , wet spaces are ideal shelters for mosquitoes to lay their eggs			2
the sticky larvae then attaches to the polystyrene			0
scientists check the traps every two weeks			2
if larvae are seen , the polystyrene is removed and bagged , and a replacement inserted			0
samples are then tested in the laboratory to identify the insect species			0
traps : mosquito traps that attract the insects have now been set up at motorway service stations ( file picture ) @entity60 , head of medical entomology at @entity62 , said : ' asian tiger mosquitoes have now spread along motorways from @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity67 through the south of @entity69 as far as @entity70			1
' but with many holidaymakers driving to the south of @entity69 , @entity67 and @entity66 the potential is there for the mosquito to enter the country			0
' if a mosquito flies into a car you ’ll swat them , but people are unlikely to know if a mosquito is sheltering inside a caravan or trailer			0
' so we ’ve decided to set up traps away from the coast where mosquitoes may escape from vehicles into the environment			1
' shipments to @entity21 of used tyres where the mosquito likes to nest are also routinely inspected			0
@entity8 tiger mosquitoes , named after their distinctive striped markings , thrive in temperate climate and can carry more than 20 exotic diseases			1
dr @entity60 said the intensive mosquito surveillance was necessary so health chiefs could plan for possible disease outbreaks and warn people about the potential threat			0
surveillance is also being extended in a triangle from @entity103 in @entity104 to @entity105 and @entity106 in @entity107 to monitor the spread of another dangerous mosquito , known as @entity110 , which can transmit @entity111 which can be fatal to humans			0
until four years , ago this mosquito was thought to be extinct in the @entity21 , but it was found in a trap in marshes at @entity116 , @entity107 , and has extended to @entity117			0
mosquitoes trapped and tested have so far been free of the virus			2
july is the peak time for mosquitoes in @entity21 , but householders can reduce numbers in their garden by emptying paddling pools , covering water butts and turning buckets , plant pots or other containers upside down to prevent collecting water which attracts the insects .			1
