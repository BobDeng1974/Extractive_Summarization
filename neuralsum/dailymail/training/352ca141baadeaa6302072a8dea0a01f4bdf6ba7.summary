@entity2 property mogul @entity9 has said three wooden boxes containing £ 1,000 in cash will be buried in secret countryside locations outside @entity14 and the @entity15 @entity9 put @entity22 on alert with his announcement that he was planning to bury three treasure boxes somewhere in the countryside earlier this month 20 envelopes stuffed with £ 50 in cash were hidden around @entity29 in @entity14			1
most were recovered within a couple of hours			0
however , the clues for the £ 1,000 boxes will be far more cryptic in a bid to baffle would - be treasure hunters			1
the clues will be tweeted to followers of the @ hiddencash handle			1
the successful treasure hunters are asked to tweet a photograph of them with their winnings to inspire rivals			1
mr @entity9 told @entity42 that he was following a formula used by @entity7 artist @entity44 who in 1979 buried a valuable golden hare encrusted with jewels in @entity47			2
mr @entity9 said he would add clues every two or three day to narrow down the locations of the buried treasure , admitting it could take several weeks mr @entity9 said the boxes will be buried in fields , somewhere in the @entity22 countryside outside of @entity14 and the @entity55 such as this idyllic location in @entity57 @entity9 launched his treasure hunt scheme in the @entity59 in @entity60 before unleashing it on the world using this the image of his squirrel @entity9 , 43 , is a @entity60 property developer who made his millions buying and selling houses in the @entity67 before moving into property a decade ago , @entity9 was involved in internet marketing , selling cars and trading diamonds			1
he said he ' discovered real estate ' aged 34			0
he told his followers : ' i have made more money in a short time than all those other businesses combined			2
there is nothing like it , unless you are exceptionally brilliant and lucky and have a knack for technology			0
' he created his @ hiddencash alter - ego in @entity59 , leaving small amounts of cash hidden around @entity60 and the surrounding area he has since attracted almost 700,000 followers as leaves cash in locations around the world			1
last week he left £ 1,000 divided among 20 envelopes hidden in @entity29 in @entity14			1
he said : ' i was so inspired by the idea that this writer could cause such fascination , that so many people could join together in search for something			0
' because the money has gone up we will make the clues much harder , much more cryptic			2
people found them too quickly when we hid them in @entity105 ; we want to really intellectually challenge hunters with this one			0
' mr @entity9 said he had no agenda other than to use social media to bring people together in the outdoors			2
‘ that ’s the key thing here – that and brightening up people ’s day , ’ he said			0
during the @entity105 experiment , the first envelope was recovered by @entity116 of east @entity14 who discovered the envelope containing £ 50 in cash and a hand written note wedged into a tree stump			2
she said : ‘ the whole point of this is a game for everyone to get involved			0
the atmosphere in the park was great			0
’ even luckier than her were @entity129 and @entity130 from north @entity14 , who were working together , who found one each – then an extra one			2
mr @entity129 said he was giving the third £ 50 to charity			0
in @entity2 the sums of money involved are generally $ 100 a time			0
after the first hunt in @entity60 the next were in @entity135 , @entity136 and @entity137 the key clue was ‘ what do @entity139 , @entity140 and @entity141 all have in common ? ’ the answer was that they were all castaways – and the cash in @entity136 was hidden close to the city ’s @entity146			0
in @entity10 , a 14 - year - old girl who found some £ 120 in her envelope wept as she told a reporter that she was going to send it to her grandmother in @entity137 to help her buy medicine			0
critics and cynics suggest the hunts are either an attention - seeking exercise by mr @entity9 , or a promotional campaign for @entity12 , and that the money would be better spent going straight to charity			1
the lucky few who found the cash , however , have no complaints			0
@entity165 from @entity166 , @entity167 , found one of the @ hiddencash envelopes during a treasure hunt in @entity167 's @entity171			1

treasure hunters will receive clues following @ hiddencash on @entity12
the treasure boxes have not been buried yet , but clues will be cryptic

the only clue is that he wo *n't* be leaving the money in the @entity15
