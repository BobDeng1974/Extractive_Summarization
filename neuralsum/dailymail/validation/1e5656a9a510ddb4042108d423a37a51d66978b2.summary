the @entity1 flight that crashed in the @entity2 came down less than a mile from an almost identical air disaster more than 60 years ago when 44 people were killed			1
the fate of the @entity6 , which appeared to drop out of the sky yesterday over the village of @entity9 , appears to mirror that of @entity12 flight 178 which crashed close by in 1953			1
the aircraft , a @entity14 , was coming into land at @entity16 , when it crashed into the side of @entity18 , close to @entity9			1
however , the plane encountered stormy weather over the @entity2 with residents in the small village of @entity39 reporting seeing the aircraft crash into the mountainside and burst into flames			1
when rescue teams reached the scene the next day , there were no survivors , with all 35 passengers and nine crew members killed			0
among those that died was @entity2 violinist @entity51			1
an @entity12 @entity14 aircraft , which flew the airline 's service from @entity28 to @entity27 in the 1950s			2
a similar model crashed in the @entity2 in 1953 less than a mile from the doomed @entity1 aircraft yesterday famous @entity2 violinist @entity51 , who was killed in the @entity12 crash in september 1953 investigators then put the cause of the crash was down to ' controlled flight into terrain '			1
this means that an airworthy aircraft , under pilot control , is unintentionally flown into the ground , a mountain , water , or an obstacle , with the pilots generally unaware of the danger until it is too late			2
yesterday 's crash in almost the exact same spot , all 144 passengers , including six crew members were killed on the flight en route from @entity79 to @entity80			0
the majority of the passengers were @entity83 and @entity84 with 16 children from the same school in @entity87 near @entity80 losing their lives			0
a @entity2 @entity90 helicopter flies over the snow covered @entity2 during a search and rescue operation			2
the crash site is less than a mile from the 1953 disaster it has been claimed that the doomed @entity1 plane may have crashed because the windscreen cracked , causing a sudden drop in oxygen that rendered the pilots unconscious			1
reports circulating on professional pilot forums suggested the black box on the @entity6 had been analysed and revealed that a ' structural failure ' was responsible for the disaster			0
it is thought the windscreen gave way , incapacitating the pilots and leaving them unable to send out a distress call			0
rescue helicopters have today resumed the search for debris and bodies at the crash site			0
as with the crash 60 years ago , there are no survivors today , search operations resumed at first light this morning in near - freezing conditions for debris and bodies at the crash site			0
reports revealed the aircraft had suffered technical issues , including a landing gear problem , a day before it was due to fly from @entity79 to @entity80			0
urgent safety checks are now being carried out on other @entity128 - popular with budget airlines - while passengers were left stranded at @entity131 , @entity132 and @entity133 yesterday after several @entity1 crews refused to work over safety fears			2
