and it seems @entity2 still has our hearts today			2
the naked chef has been voted @entity15 's favourite celebrity chef in a new survey , as well as the cook whose recipes we find easiest to follow at home			2
the survey also shows that @entity15 feel long time culinary queen and television staple @entity20 is out of date , and that the famously sultry @entity24 makes us fat			1
@entity2 , 37 , was picked as our number one by almost a fifth ( 23 per cent ) of those polled - with @entity28 second ( 16 per cent ) and @entity24 third ( 11 per cent )			1
the least popular was @entity31 's @entity30 , picked by just one per cent of the 1,000 people polled by diet firm @entity33			0
surprisingly , the nation 's cookery queen @entity34 came second bottom with just two per cent of votes			0
@entity34 , 71 , was also the chef voted most out of date - chosen by more than quarter of respondents ( 26 per cent ) , as being increasingly past her sell by date			1
foul mouthed dynamo @entity28 was almost deemed by respondents to be outstaying his welcome on our tv screens with 12 per cent of the vote with the @entity49 coming third ( 10 per cent )			0
when it comes to actually picking up the spatula and heading into the kitchen ourselves , the nation 's foodies reckon that @entity2 's recipes are the easiest to follow - with 57 per cent saying his were the most reliable			1
@entity34 came second for reliability ( 14 per cent ) and @entity24 third ( 8 per cent )			2
unsurprisingly @entity59 , who is famous for his complicated and intricate recipes such as snail porridge , came bottom with just one per cent of the votes			0
one of the most interesting findings is that people feel that if you cook @entity24 's recipes you are likely to have the most fun - but also most likely to pile on the pounds			1
@entity34 , left , is deemed out of date , while @entity24 , right , is voted as being the most fun - and most fattening it is to be expected that people fear eating the famously voluptuous chefs food will wreak havoc with your waistline			1
the @entity77 star 's chocolate hazelnut cheesecake , featured on her tv show @entity79 , famously contains more than 7,000 calories			0
@entity59 9 % 1 @entity24 31 % 2 @entity2 30 % 3 @entity28 10 % @entity82 8 % 5 @entity49 6 % she was chosen as the most calorific chef by 49 per cent of those polled - beating the @entity49 ( 11 per cent ) and @entity20 ( 9 per cent )			1
but it 's not just eating ms @entity24 's recipes that is why we blame her for piling on the pounds			2
1 @entity2 57 % 2 @entity20 14 % 3 @entity24 8 % 4 @entity81 6 % 5 @entity28 5 % 1 @entity24 49 % 2 @entity49 11 % 3 @entity20 9 % 4 @entity2 8 % 5 @entity59 6 % the kitchen temptress , @entity24 also makes us hungriest when we watch her shows - chosen by 31 per cent , ahead of @entity2 on 30 per cent and @entity28 ( 10 per cent )			1

1 @entity20 26 % 2 @entity28 12 % 3 @entity49 10 % 4 @entity2 10 % 5 @entity81 9 % ' virtually all of us have got one of his books in our homes and any idiot can follow the instructions			1
' it is interesting that @entity34 has gone so quickly from the being the nation 's favourite to being such a turn off			0
' we are learning to love food more and become a bit more ambitious with our cooking			0
itâ € ™ s why so many of us are over-weight			0
' the days of @entity34 telling us all how to boil an egg are long gone			0
it 's why @entity24 is so popular			2
