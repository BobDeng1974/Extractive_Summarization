by @entity0 published : 17:55 est , 22 march 2012 updated : 18:19 est , 22 march 2012 addiction : @entity2 turned to online poker while depressed and suspended from work a high flying headmaster who stole £ 53,000 of school funds to finance his gambling addiction was jailed for 16 months today			1
a court heard how father of three @entity2 , 41 , became depressed after he was suspended over a child 's accusation of sexual misconduct			1
following a full police investigation no action was taken against him , and he was allowed to return to school			2
but , the court heard , the police probe had taken its toll and he secretly turned to online poker , often playing into the early hours of the morning			1
he blew the family ’s £ 90,000 savings , then the £ 70,000 he got by remortgaging the family home without his wife 's knowledge , and finally turned to the school 's fund			1
@entity29 , sitting at @entity28 , heard how @entity2 knew that the charitable fund was operated within the school and not subject to @entity33 auditing			2
after he gambled away the funds a proposed extension to the school hall at @entity37 , in @entity38 , had to be put on hold			2
two anonymous letters were received by @entity33 and following the tip - off @entity2 - at the school for 17 years , the last three as headmaster - was told an emergency audit would take place			1
he cleared his desk and went home to confess to his pregnant wife what he had done and that they were in financial ruin , explained prosecuting barrister @entity51			1
@entity2 then sent a text to the chair of governors , @entity55 , asking him to come around urgently			2
in a second text he said : ' it is very big			2
i have done something very wrong that is going to have big consequences for you and for the school			2
' mr @entity55 went to see him that evening and was left in a state of shock and disbelief			2
suspended : @entity37 , in @entity38 , @entity66 , @entity67			0
the school 's head teacher @entity68 stole from its funds to finance his online poker habit @entity2 , who was immediately suspended , apologised and said that he wanted to pay the money back			1
mr @entity51 said : ' he unburdened himself to mr @entity55 and said it began about a year earlier , following a criminal investigation into the defendant			1
he was unable to sleep and turned to school funds after he exhausted his own finances			1
' ' he did not tell anyone about his gambling addiction and did not get any help because he was embarrassed			0
' the headmaster had been so trusted that other signatories signed blank cheques			0
he photocopied one and made up a legitimate reason for spending it , while the real cheque was paid into his own account			0
he had also used school computers to transfer money to himself			0
arrested and interviewed last october , he said that he used poker websites in the early hours or when home alone			1
mr @entity55 had since taken him to @entity92			0
@entity2 admitted two theft charges with eight similar offences taken into consideration , amounting to £ 53,438			0
defence barrister @entity96 said @entity2 had been a highly successful headmaster and that the school performed well in inspections			0
' he was extremely dedicated to his work - and it may be at the expense of his family life , ' he said			1
@entity2 was suspended after an allegation of sexual misconduct in july 2010 , and for ten days he was even banned from returning home to see his own children			1
when he returned that december , his accusers were still in school and his requests for help from the @entity33 fell on deaf ears			0
' he became more mistrustful and withdrawn			1
there was a tangible difference between the @entity114 who was headmaster before he was suspended and the one who returned to school , ' mr @entity96 said			1
judge @entity117 said that it was a very sad but a very serious case			0
' the most significant aggravating feature is that you were in a position of trust			0
given your role as headmaster it was a high degree of trust , ' the judge said			0
' the funds that ought to have been used for the benefit of pupils have been lost and there has been an impact on both staff and pupils at the school			0
' i also take into account the impact the unproven allegations had on your health and which , it is said , led indirectly to you gambling large amounts of money			0
