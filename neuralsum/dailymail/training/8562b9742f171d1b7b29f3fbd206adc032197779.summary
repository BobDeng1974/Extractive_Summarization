latest figures show £ 2.5billion is owed in council tax areas in @entity9 , equivalent to more than £ 100 for every home in the country , with £ 3 in every £ 100 going uncollected last year			1
the government has named @entity13 as the ' worst ' at tackling the problem , with arrears totalling £ 450 per family , compared to @entity17 in @entity18 where the figure is just £ 14			1

@entity22 councils also have some of the highest amounts of arrears per household			0
in @entity36 , north @entity22 , the figure was £ 366 , @entity37 £ 321 , @entity38 £ 299 and @entity39 £ 290			0
other councils in the top 10 include @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 and @entity46 and @entity47 , where £ 245 is owed for each of the £ 430,000 homes			2
despite increased pressure on local authorities , with deep cuts in their budgets , the amount of money they collected in council tax last year actually fell			1
just 97 per cent of the levy was paid in 2013 - 14 , compared to 97.4 per cent a year earlier			0
it means town halls ' performance is now no better than it was in 2008			0
the government insists that the growing council tax debt mountain is a ' significant potential source of income ' which councils could use to support frontline services or freeze bills			1
communities secretary @entity69 said that many of the worst offenders were run by @entity72 , who were failing to tackle the problem			0
he told @entity75 : ' the @entity72 councils which complain the most about lack of government handouts are the ones with the worst records for not collecting their own taxes and these new figures show how incompetent they are			1
' by failing to get these payments they are not only turning a blind eye to tax evasion but driving up council tax costs for honest citizens as well			1
' every penny of council tax that is not collected by town halls means a higher bill for the law - abiding citizens who do pay on time			1
' by tackling this tax loss , these figures show that there is real scope for sensible savings by councils to help pay off the @entity104 's deficit and freeze council tax down again this year			1
' however , @entity105 hit back , insisting it was working hard to reduce the amount owed and last year cut the bill by £ 33.5million			2
last year it collected £ 7.6 million in historic @entity109 arrears and around £ 280,000 of @entity111 debt			0
officials had ruled out writing off a proportion of historic debt , as some councils do , choosing instead to work on trying to claw it back from families who owe it			0
a council spokesman said : ' our collection rate is as good as other large cities , at around 95 per cent			2
however , unlike other councils we will not simply automatically write off arrears after five years			0
' we believe that people should pay their way , and letting them off the hook robs other council tax payers of vital public services			1
' this is money that the council would not otherwise have had and is helping offset the £ 156 million we have to save over the next three years due to cuts in central government funding			0
' in @entity42 , £ 30.7million is owed in arrears , equivalent to £ 277,43 for every home			2
councillor @entity137 , responsible for finance on the council , said : ' we do all we can legally to peruse the debts but in some circumstances it is not possible or financially viable to pursue the debt ; if somebody has died , or left the country , for example			2
' the decision to write off a debt is only ever taken as a last resort when all of our investigations have been exhausted or where it would no longer be cost effective for the council to peruse the case			0
' this is good accounting practice across all organisations and the @entity158 's @entity157 highlights that we manage our resources well			0
' communities secretary @entity69 said @entity72 councils were failing to tackle the problem of collecting council tax arrears , which could be used to support frontline services @entity17 is named by the government as the ' best ' council for tackling council tax arrears , worth just £ 14 per household			1
@entity168 , executive director at @entity169 , said : ' @entity170 has a robust system in place to monitor the level of @entity109 arrears			0
' this process involves regular reminders being sent out and seeking to manage arrears at the earliest point and not allowing arrears to accumulate			0
' in cases where there is no response or effort made to pay , then formal recovery action will be taken in order to protect the council			0
the low level of arrears benefits all the council tax payers in the @entity190 by ensuring that the provision that the council has to provide for non-payment is kept to a minimum			2
' the @entity26 has produced a document for councils called ' 50 ways to save ' , which includes improving council tax collection rates and reducing arrears ' as a key way of making sensible savings to help keep overall council tax bills down and protect frontline services ' .			1
