losing weight will be the answer to many people 's prayers			0
but they may not realise dramatic weight loss can have a deeply distressing side - effect : excess skin			2
this hidden downside of losing weight occurs as a result of damage to the deeper layers of skin , the dermis , which contains two proteins : elastin , which helps it retract , and collagen , for strength			2
when the skin is stretched too much through weight gain , these proteins tear and break , resulting in a loss of elasticity and strength			2
unfortunately , while losing weight causes the fat cells to lose their fat , the skin can not retract			0
it is linked unpleasant health problems , from infections to back pain			0
doctors say the excess skin after weight loss is the same skin damage that occurs during pregnancy — but all over the body			2
factors that affect how much skin is left include age , how quickly the weight was lost ( gastric bands are slower than bypasses , for example ) , and , for women , the number of children she has had			1
many patients patients develop an ' apron ' of skin around the abdomen , and loose skin under the arms , chest and inner thighs			0
this excess skin can cause a range of medical problems			0
one of the most common is intertrigo — a bacterial , fungal , or viral infection that occurs often due to the difficulty in keeping these folds of excess skin clean and dry			0
patients also find the folds of skin make it difficult to exercise			0
excess skin is a problem particularly for people who undergo weight loss surgery			0
' on the surface it seemed like my weight did n't bother me , i would n't listen when people called me names			0
but inside i was really unhappy with my body			0
' in adulthood miss @entity7 began suffering with asthma and sleep apnoea - a condition where the walls of the throat relax during sleep and interrupt normal breathing - because of her obesity			1
desperate to change , she applied for a gastric bypass on the @entity22			1
in august 2009 miss @entity7 went under the knife and within a year of having the operation had lost six stone			2
she said : ' it took a long time to adjust to eating less , but after a while it became normal			0
' i feel fantastic now - my sleep apnea and asthma have gone			2
people do n't realise how different your life is after a dramatic weight loss - almost nothing can stop me now			0
' before her weight loss miss @entity7 would typically eat a big bowl of sugary cereal for breakfast , chicken with curry sauce and chips for lunch and a large cottage pie for dinner			2
throughout the day she would gorge on crisps , sweets and pour herself fizzy drinks			0
after the gastric bypass procedure she radically changed her diet , and now eats a slice of toast for breakfast , a chicken and salad sandwich for lunch and fresh fish with steamed vegetables for dinner			1
throughout the day she snacks on fresh fruit , yogurt and crackers , drinking only water			0
within two years of having her operation , miss @entity7 had shed 13 stone			1
she now weighs 11 stone , and has managed to ditch her tent - like size 28 clothes for slinky size 12 dresses			0
but the rapid weight loss left miss @entity7 with giant folds of saggy skin			1
she has applied to the @entity22 for a tummy tuck twice but her application has been denied both times , and her last hope is to apply for a third time this year			2
the cost of such an operation from a private clinic would be around £ 15,000			0
she said : ' i try not to let my saggy skin get me down , but i do n't feel like i have my dream body yet			1
she says her stomach , legs and arms have lots of saggy skin which is preventing her from finding love			1
she said : ' i have n't been in a proper relationship since losing weight - i need to get my skin done so i can love my body ' ' both my tummy and legs have lots of really saggy skin - but no amount of exercise will shift it			1
' i do n't regret losing the weight , i 'm so much healthier now , but i long to find love			0
i just do n't know if i 'll ever be ready to share the secret that lies beneath my clothes			0
' i have n't been in a proper relationship since losing weight - i need to get my skin done so i can love my body			2
' you know what they say - you need to learn to love yourself before somebody else will			0
' i keep being turned down for the procedure because they want me to show that i have severe depression linked to my saggy skin			1
but why should i have to lie so they will fix my body ? ' i 've paid my tax and national insurance since i was 17 - so i 've paid my way			1
