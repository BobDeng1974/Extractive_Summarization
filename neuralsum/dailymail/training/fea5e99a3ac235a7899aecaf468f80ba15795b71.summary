this is the story of two players			0
the first is a young striker who does well at a club which is established in the @entity4 , but which does n’t have a recent history of challenging for cups or the top four			0
his talents catch the eye of certain clubs who are challenging for such honours			0
naturally the player wants to go and test himself at that higher level			0
he is open and honest about it , he pledges to do all he can to score goals and help his current team stay up , before making it clear he wants to move on when the season is over			1
this player is @entity22 ; he is vilified , dropped and labelled a troublemaker and a problem player , who has ‘ baggage ’			1
@entity22 has been labelled as a troublemaker despite being honest about his desire to help @entity28 @entity22 was dropped by @entity28 boss @entity29 for the weekend 's 2 - 2 draw against @entity31 @entity22 has been a success at @entity34 level and has been courted by several @entity4 clubs the second player is also a young striker , he says absolutely nothing publicly , keeps on doing well and scoring goals for his club in a relegation battle , but knows he will be allowed to leave his club for nothing , earn a bumper wage and a big signing on fee when the season is over , whether they stay up or not			1
this player is @entity49 ; he is loved and admired by pretty much everybody , and he ’s never criticised			1
i really like @entity49 , and admire his career path , as well as the way he plays			2
but is he worthy of more praise and respect just because he is not telling the fans anything about his future ? there is a strong possibility that having given the player a great opportunity in the game , @entity31 could be left with nothing this summer			1
some might say that he will be allowed to leave on a free transfer with the blessing of the @entity31 fans if he scores the goals to keep them up			1
will the same warmth be offered to @entity22 at @entity28 ? it does n’t look likely , so what ’s the difference ? is it down to a couple of incidents off the field ? there are plenty of @entity4 players who have similar – worse - difficulties but those are virtually forgotten in an instant ( @entity83 ’s @entity82 is a recent example ) , so surely it ca n’t be that			1
@entity49 ' situation mirrors that of @entity22 , yet the @entity31 striker is not viewed as being difficult @entity49 has netted eight times this season , compared to @entity22 's nine , and both men are highly courted @entity49 put @entity31 2 - 0 up at @entity92 , only to see his side pegged back by a sterling @entity28 fightback some have suggested @entity22 has been badly advised			1
really ? let ’s get this straight – he ’s gone on record and said he wants to do well for @entity28 , keep them up , and then go on to bigger things			2
he ’s been honest with the fans and everyone about his plans for the future			2
what ’s wrong with being honest ? should he be advised to lie , or not be up front with the fans who pay his wages ? and he ’s been criticised for doing an interview without the club ’s permission			2
one of the worst features of the modern game in this country is how far removed players are from fans in the @entity4			0
but worse than that , it seems players are gagged while it ’s fine for a club to say what it wants about a player - @entity22 has been in the naughty chair ? seriously , @entity29 , with comments like that is the player likely to change his mind and stay ? @entity29 also said @entity22 lacks ‘ mentors ’ , highlighting that he lost his father at an early age , and blaming this for his desire to play at a higher level and earn more money			1
i know from personal experience how growing up without a father stacks the odds against you			0
rather than stare down from some sort of mythical moral high ground , maybe @entity29 should applaud @entity22 for coming so far with so little in his favour			0
we have recently heard stories about @entity145 allegedly being late for training			0
why would a club with class like @entity28 leak information like that ? it only serves to damage the player ’s reputation			2
spend any time at any club and you ’ll know players are regularly late for training and meetings , they pay an internal fine and it never gets out			0
why is @entity22 being singled out here ? @entity22 appears to have been singled out by his club for a minor breach of discipline both @entity49 and @entity22 are said to have caught the eye of the likes of rivals @entity167 and @entity169 this is a kid who has come through a difficult early life , he ’s been given a great chance at @entity28 , and he ’s taken it			1
that football club are set to make a fortune from his sale , and assuming they stay up they will be grateful for the goals he scored to contribute to that survival bid			0
meanwhile @entity49 , also scoring goals to help @entity31 stay up , says nothing to the fans , and will make his club no money if he leaves this summer			1
so who ’s the bad guy ? neither player deserves criticism yet @entity22 is being hounded			2
sources close to @entity22 have wondered if there could be racist undertones to the vilification of this young talent : he ’s black and he was n’t born in @entity194			1
i refuse to believe that , and i sincerely hope it is n’t true			0
but what is true is that the @entity22 witch - hunt is getting ridiculous .			0

@entity22 has been open about his desire to leave @entity28 at the end of the season
he has been dropped and labelled a troublemaker because of his stance
@entity49 will be allowed to leave on a free transfer with the blessing of the @entity31 fans if he scores the goals to keep them up
will the same warmth be offered to @entity22 at @entity28 ?
it does n’t look likely , so what ’s the difference ?
