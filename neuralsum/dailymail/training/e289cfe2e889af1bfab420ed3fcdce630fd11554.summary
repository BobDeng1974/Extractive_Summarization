the growth of single parent families – most often without a father – means children are growing up without the steadying influence of a strong and caring man			0
many end up with a skewed view of life from friends , television or even pornography			1
headteachers are bringing in male mentoring schemes which replace the father and son chats that were once a rite of passage			0
pupils are being guided through topics such as the right way to ask a girl out , how to treat women and what it means to be a good pupil and friend			1
other practical help includes shaving tips , how to be presentable and money management			2
@entity5 in @entity46 , @entity47 , is introducing a scheme from next month			1
headteacher @entity4 said it was mainly aimed at pupils ‘ on free school meals who may not have a male role model in their life ’			2
‘ young men have a skewed view of what a relationship is like because of the easy access to pornography , ’ she added			1
‘ sex education often only deals with how not to get pregnant and violent relationships			0
we want this scheme to teach pupils details on establishing relationships and how to end them without breaking hearts			0
‘ i have a school full of brilliant male role models and it would be a shame to waste that			0
’ @entity76 , an art teacher taking part in the ‘ man days ’ , said : ‘ youngsters these days are very desensitised to the world due to computer games , tv and pornography			2
we need to teach them that women are not sex objects and that it is not all right to pass around pictures of them on mobile phones			2
role model scheme : teachers at @entity5 hope it will improve boys ' learning and eventually their academic results ‘ the lessons will teach boys how to approach women , how to take them out and treat them properly			1
’ boys will also be offered golf lessons , football tournaments , camping and survival skills to encourage team - building			2
girls at the secondary school – which was recently graded ‘ inadequate ’ by @entity109 inspectors – will have lessons from female teachers covering money management and career aspirations			1

earlier this year a study of family breakdown warned a million children are growing up in ‘ men deserts ’ – living without a father and rarely meeting an adult male			0
in some areas , three in every four families are headed by one parent , the @entity135 said , claiming it was causing a ‘ tsunami of family breakdown ’			0
the effects of family breakups on children are known to include poor school performance , difficulty making friends , bad behaviour , anxiety , depression and a greater chance of drug - taking or crime			0
a quarter of primary schools did not have a single male teacher in 2010			0
two decades ago , men made up four in ten teachers			1
the shift away from education was linked to the attraction of other graduate jobs and fears of allegations of inappropriate behaviour			0
but figures last month showed the number of men training to be primary school teachers has surged by nearly a third in five years			1
teacher recruitment expert professor @entity170 said : ‘ if you have n’t got a male role model at home or at school then it ’s a challenge for boys as there is nothing to counteract the sort of role model you get on television			0

teachers at @entity5 in @entity46 have *agreed* to help
boys will learn about how to treat women and how to speak to them
' young men have a skewed view of what a relationship is like because of the easy access to pornography ' , headteacher says
students also taught how to be better with money and *personal* *hygiene*
