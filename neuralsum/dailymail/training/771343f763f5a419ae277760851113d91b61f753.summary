by @entity1 @entity0 @entity2 was burnt to death in her home in 2011 @entity5 lawyer @entity2 died an ' excruciating ' death in a blaze that was lit in her bedroom at the behest of her calculating boyfriend			1
but exactly why ms @entity2 was killed remains puzzling , the sentencing judge says			1
the 31 - year - old solicitor died in a blaze that engulfed her home in @entity15 in @entity5 's north on october 27 , 2011			1
she had tried to flee but was overcome by smoke and heat			2
in sentencing the trio for her murder on monday , justice @entity19 said ' it is difficult to contemplate a more frightening and excruciating way ' to die			2
' she died alone with no possible chance of escape			2
' ms @entity2 's one - time friend @entity27 pleaded guilty in june 2013 to her role in the murder			2
the solicitor 's sometime boyfriend @entity30 and a third accused , @entity32 , were found guilty in april			1
during this trial , the @entity33 heard @entity36 ' friendship with ms @entity2 turned sour after the 31 - year - old solicitor had been intimate with her former lover and convicted criminal @entity38			0
but it took the ' cold and calculating ' @entity30 to push @entity36 ' dislike to the next level , justice @entity19 said			0
from august 2011 @entity30 sparked an affair with the insecure @entity36 and began feeding her lies and saying they could never be together while ms @entity2 was alive			1
the judge said in sentencing : ' she died alone with no possible chance of escape ' the 31 - year - old had tried to get out of her bedroom , where the inferno was lit , but had collapsed after being overcome by smoke and heat @entity36 in turn recruited @entity32 to assist in the murder scheme			0
while text messages and evidence reveal how the solicitor was killed , justice @entity19 said he remained at ' a complete loss to understand ' why			0
whatever ' so - called issues ' @entity30 had with ms @entity2 , they were ' hardly the stuff of revenge or retribution , ' he said			0

none of the allegations levelled by @entity36 at ms @entity2 was ever substantiated , the court heard			0
and @entity30 's drive to kill ms @entity2 appeared to be based on ' cold indifference to her right to live her own way , on her own terms '			0
@entity2 's mother @entity81 told the court earlier this month that she was still haunted by nightmares of her daughter dying @entity85 ( centre ) , father of murdered solicitor @entity2 , is pictured outside the @entity87 at today 's sentencing he gave @entity30 , who has shown no remorse , the heaviest sentence , setting a minimum of 27 years and a maximum of 36 years			1
despite the fact @entity36 went to ms @entity2 's home to light the fire , justice @entity19 said she was less morally culpable , owing to @entity30 's manipulation , and he sentenced her to a minimum of 18 years and a maximum of 24			1
meanwhile @entity32 , who @entity67 found played a ' passive role ' in the murder , was sentenced to at least 14 years			1
