pictured arriving at a tribunal hearing in @entity5 a family doctor cupped a patient 's breast in his hands and began breathing ' heavily and erratically ' as she underwent an examination for a severe cough , a medical tribunal heard today			1
married father - of - two dr @entity2 , 42 , locked the door of his consulting room and told the woman to take off her bra before he knelt in front of her with his head in ' close proximity ' to her nipples , it was claimed			1
he was also said to have squeezed the patient ’s right breast and appeared to be ' jittery ' during the routine chest examination			1
the woman claimed she could only see the top of the gp ’s head as he listened under her right breast			1
the alleged incident occurred in march 2012 after the 42 - year old woman known as @entity32 went to see dr @entity2 at the @entity35 surgery in @entity36 , @entity37 , where he is senior partner			1
the hearing was told she had suffered chest conditions including pleurisy , pneumonia and sarcoidosis for a number of years which required up to 60 chest examinations			1
she had previously been prescribed antibiotics			2
giving evidence from behind a screen at the @entity50 ’s @entity49 in @entity5 , @entity32 said : ' i told dr @entity2 i had a severe cough and i took a place on the couch			1
' he stood up and stood in front of me			2
i sat on the edge and he was facing me			2
he asked me to remove my top			0
he said it was so he could give me a chest exam			1
there was no screen or curtain			0
he did n’t offer me a chaperone , i ’m very certain of that , but i did n’t request one either			0
' i was wearing a bra and kept it on at that stage			0
he began to listen to my chest with a stethoscope			1
he was n’t particularly talking			0
he also listened to my back			2
i leant forward because i ’m used to having chest exams			2
' he listened under my bra strap from the front to my chest but he did n’t explain that was what he was going to do			1
he then asked me to remove my bra			0
he said it was to listen to my chest			1
' it was slightly uncomfortable but he ’s a doctor			2
he removed it entirely and put it on the bench			0
i put my arm across my breasts to cover them			0
he began to listen to my chest through a stethoscope			1
' he was listening to my chest and moved my arm away from my breast			1
he did n’t tell me that was what he was going to do and gave me no explanation			0
' i did n’t say anything about it			0
he went on his knees and held my right breast in his left hand			2
he was holding the whole breast			2
he asked me to lean forwards into him while he was still holding my breasts and i followed the instruction and then he listened underneath my breast and all i could see was the top of his head			2
' his head was level with under my breast because i remember just being able to see the top of his head			2
he was touching my nipple as he cupped my breasts to lift it with the palm of his hand			1
' he kept his hand still			0
he did n’t say anything while he put the stethoscope under my breast and he did n’t move it anywhere else			2
i thought his breathing seemed erratic			0
he had n’t discussed breathing during the exam or whether he would give me a breathing demonstration			2
' it came to an end when he got up and walked away and said i could get dressed			0
he was slightly uncomfortable but maybe that ’s because i felt like that			0
he turned away from me quite quickly and told me to get dressed			0
' i thought the chest exam was unusual while it was happening			1
it had made me feel uncomfortable as soon as it happened			0
there was n’t one particular reason why i did n’t say anything at the time			0
i just wanted to leave			0
you do n’t jump to conclusions quickly like this			0
she added : ' the door was locked when i came to leave the room			1
i recall the doctor locking the door			1
he did n’t tell me he had done that			0
when i was on the couch before he asked me to remove my top he locked the door			1
i unlocked the door to go out and i left			2
he did n’t say bye and neither did @entity137 ' @entity32 claims dr @entity2 locked the consulting room door at @entity140 in @entity36 , before asking her to remove her bra while he examined her chest			1
during the examination , she claims he ' touched her nipple as he cupped her right breast ' , to lift it to allow him to listen to her chest the woman later confided in a friend as to what happened before alerting her husband two days later			1
she made a formal complaint by letter to the surgery on may 11 and the case was referred to the @entity155			0
@entity156 , counsel for the @entity157 said : ' she says he locked the door of the room and told her he needed to listen to her lungs and asked her to remove her top			1
' he moved her to a couch and asked her to remove her bra as it was obstructing him			0
she did so , and placed her arms across her breasts			0
' he moved her arms out of the way and asked her to lean forwards and she says he placed his whole hand on her entire breast including her nipple			1
he was jittery and his breathing was erratic			0
' she brought the consultation to an end , put her clothes on and soon realised she had been subject to an inappropriate examination			0
' dr @entity2 , from @entity36 who specialises in minor surgery , dermatology and ear , nose and throat complaints , denies charges of sexually motivated misconduct			1
miss @entity156 said : ' he describes himself as being absolutely devastated to read the complaint in the letter			0
' he describes a consultation which involved two complaints by the patient - she was concerned about her chest and the possibility of pneumonia			1
' it is standard procedure that a full chest exam requires the doctor to listen to the front , back and side of the chest and because of the abdominal pain he had to listen to the abdomen			1
