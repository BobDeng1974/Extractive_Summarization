the traditionally - built cob cottage in @entity8 , @entity9 , buckled and collapsed into the street yesterday afternoon the narrow street in the seaside wall was rendered impassable after the side of the terraced house fell away how it looked before : the cob cottages in @entity8 have typically thick walls - they 're often 24 inches thick it emerged today that builders had been working to repair a crack in the front wall of the house , which is home to a couple in their 30s with children , who were out at the time			1
@entity35 , an architectural surveyor who lives in the street near the town centre , said : ' the scaffolding twisted and collapsed onto the road			1
' luckily there was no - one on the street , which is usually quite busy			0
' he added : ' cob is usually a good material for building but it can dry out if covered with the wrong render			0
' emergency services attended after a neighbour called 999			0
a @entity9 and @entity51 police spokesman said : ' there was no one in the building or on the scaffolding at the time which was very lucky			2
' the cob cottage in @entity8 is the second such building to collapse in under a week - last thursday a 400 - year - old cob cottage up the coast in @entity61 , @entity9 , buckled			1
in that incident , the owner 's father described how he fled to safety minutes before the ancient property fell to the floor			1
@entity68 said he was in his son 's house in the he heard ' cracking noises ' that got louder and louder			1
' the noises became louder so i got out , ' he said			0
' then around 20 minutes later the roof and walls came down , as if in slow motion			0
' the cob just failed			0
' scene of the collapse : engineers from @entity82 assess the damage from a cherry - picker two builders who were working in the @entity61 property at the time also escaped before the cream cottage crumpled			1
mr @entity68 , whose family have been offered accommodation by friends following the incident , said : ' until we can get inside we wo n't know what 's left intact and what is n't			2
' it could have been a lot worse - we 're just so thankful that no - one was hurt or worse			0
' the word cob comes from an old @entity100 word meaning round lump , and hands are still used to mix together the various materials to form cob when it 's used in house - building today			2
most often found in @entity108 and the south west in @entity110 , cob houses and farm buildings date back to the 14th century , and are usually made of a mix of natural building materials including clay , earth , straw , sand and water			2
known for being fireproof , cheap to build , and relative flexibility in areas of seismic activity , cob buildings typically have 24 - inch thick walls which insulate the building during winter and keep it cool during the summer , with deep - set windows and doors			2
poor people in @entity126 times often built themselves homes out of cob , as it was cheaper than the timber framed homes of the period			0
their homes were often one - roomed cottages , topped by a thatched roof , with a beaten earth floor			0
while it is similar to adobe , cob is different because it can be used in cold and wet climates - its porosity lends itself to cool damp climates .			0
