by @entity0 published : 09:30 est , 28 november 2012 updated : 12:42 est , 28 november 2012 shoppers have been left outraged after town hall bosses ditched their traditional christmas tree in favour of a ' futuristic ' £ 10,000 monstrosity			1
the towering 21st century ‘ tree ’ has left people in @entity8 town centre bemused after it appeared this weekend - with one comparing it to ' a load of space - age hamster balls '			1
the 30ft @entity15 decoration includes 41 aluminium spheres covered in more than 40,000 low energy led lights			2
the futuristic £ 10,000 tree looks out of place against the traditional backdrop in the @entity8 market square as @entity15 shoppers rush past the tree is part of a brand new £ 100,000 @entity15 display across the town funded by taxpayers and businesses in @entity8 , @entity29			1
the costly display - which includes 250,000 low energy bulbs - was thought up by business bosses in a bid to help attract more shoppers to the town during the festive season			2
but shoppers have been less than impressed by the tree			0
mother - of - two @entity38 , 38 , from @entity8 , said : ' it looks like a load of space - age hamster balls rather than a christmas tree			1
' i dread to think how much it has cost but surely @entity15 is a time of tradition , so why do they have to have an arty tree ? ' children love to see a christmas tree with all the decorations on but they are hardly going to get excited about this			1
' shoppers look on in bemusement at the 30ft futuristic @entity15 ' tree ' , which popped up in the place of the town 's traditional evergreen @entity59 , 64 , from @entity60 , added : ' it is certainly unusual - i guess people will be talking about it so in that respect it could be judged to be a success			2
' i certainly would n’t want one like this in my living room but maybe i am behind the times			0
' it looks quite futuristic but i would not say i am a big fan of it			0
' traditionally @entity8 has celebrated @entity15 by erecting a large fir tree in the @entity73 - a market square which has been in use for more than 500 years			1
but business leaders - including members of business group @entity78 which helped pay for the tree - say the town needed to break from tradition last week shoppers in @entity83 branded their new christmas tree , pictured , ' disgusting '			2
the tree became a front runner for @entity87 's worst as locals booed the switch on @entity90 , chief executive of @entity78 , defended his towns controversial futuristic structure saying its now infamous design will help get people talking about the town			2
he said : ' this is the most talked about tree in @entity99 - probably in the @entity87 this year			1
“ love it or hate it , everyone is talking about it , and thousands of people are heading into @entity8 to see it and make up their own minds			0
' most other towns would give their right arm to have this amount of conversation about them at this time of year			0
' but that response did n’t impress traditional shopper @entity112			0
he concluded : ' i would have just liked a normal christmas tree			0
' i keep wondering when the real tree and decorations are going to be delivered			0
' in @entity83 , @entity117 , last week pantomime stars @entity118 and @entity120 were jeered by crowds who were shocked by the ' atrocious ' decorations as they tried to turn on the lights			0
the pathetic tree did not look like it was in the @entity15 spirit with merely a handful of lights - leading residents and business leaders to slam it as having the ' worst decorations in @entity87 '			1
@entity132 , pictured , stands next to the limp and lifeless christmas tree before red - faced council bosses removed it at the dead of night in @entity138 , @entity139 , last year another contender for the worst decorations goes to a pathetically limp christmas tree planted in the centre of @entity138 , @entity139 , last year			1
it was judged to be so lifeless it was removed by embarrassed council bosses in the middle of the night before december even arrived			1
in 2009 a fake tree in @entity149 , @entity150 , offended locals so much that it was vandalised and town bosses were forced to take it down and replace it with something more traditional - a 30ft @entity157 spruce			0
the astroturf clad £ 14,000 ' tree ' was compared to a witches hat and a traffic cone by disgusted residents			0
it had originally been erected because of ' elf and safety fears that a traditional tree could blow over this 2009 tree - costing £ 14,000 - upset people in @entity149 , @entity150 , so much that it was vandalised			0
town hall bosses had to give in and erect a real tree more impressive at night : but despite a dazzling opening display some @entity8 residents are still waiting for the ' real ' decorations to be delivered			1

tree is part of a £ 100,000 @entity15 display in @entity8
council bosses defend it as ' the most talked about tree ' in @entity87
one mother said it is ' a time of tradition ' and children will be *disappointed*
