by @entity0 at first glance this collection of colourful containers looks more like a game of @entity5 than a hotel			0
but unlike the popular game of wooden blocks , the structure is not intended to tumble over , but instead offers a flexible design for a hotel that can grow , shrink and constantly change – as each room can be slotted in and out of a clever frame			0
the @entity14 is designed to be made of recycled shipping containers , transformed into rooms which could be themed and branded by companies , combining accommodation and advertising			1
jenga ? the structure might appear precarious , but it could be be made up of shipping containers that slot into a metal frame , enabling hotel rooms to be placed in a balanced way , much like the aim of the popular wooden game , @entity5 the building ’s modular design , which is tipped as a favourite to win the @entity31 , would allow for rooms to be traded in and out without disturbing the surrounding containers , because of its ‘ hive - like ’ structure			1
a ' core ' structure at the heart of the building would maintain structural integrity and act as a vertical lobby to connect different containers			0
the hotel concept would offer a flexible design if built , which could grow , shrink and constantly change - as each branded room ( pictured ) could be slotted in and out of a clever frame the building 's modular design , which is tipped as a favourite to win the @entity31 , would allow for rooms to be traded in and out without disturbing the surrounding containers , because of its ' hive - like ' structure			1
a crane is positioned on top of the structure to lift the pre-fabricated containers into place @entity56 - based architects @entity54 said its concept could offer lots of advertising opportunities for brands as portions of the hotel could be changed and containers temporarily sponsored by companies like @entity65 , which could design spaces inside and out , so the room is themed ( pictured ) and also doubles as a billboard @entity56 - based architects @entity54 said its concept could offer lots of advertising opportunities for brands as portions of the hotel could be changed and containers temporarily sponsored by companies like @entity65 , which could design spaces inside and out , so the room is themed and also doubles as a billboard			1
the firm claims that its design would give fans of brands the chance to stay in a place that is totally of a company ’s aesthetic			0
for example , a container designed by a fashion brand might include decor echoing popular designs , while one imagined by a car company , could feature team colours and even a modified car as a piece of furniture			0
the @entity14 is designed to be made of recycled shipping containers , transformed into rooms which could be themed and branded by companies , combining accommodation and advertising here , the layout of the hotel is explained			1
a ' core ' ( in yellow ) connects removable containers , while ' plant rooms ' ( in blue ) provide garden spaces in between layers of branded containers as partnerships with brands begin and end , the exterior would change and the layout of the hotel evolve , grow and shrink based on demand for accommodation			1
although presented as a hotel , the architects see other possibilities for @entity14 and think a more basic version of the design could be used in emergency housing or medical care units			1
they also envision that in the future people could own containers that serve as mobile apartments or offices so that when they travel , their home could travel with them			0
as partnerships with brands begin and end , the exterior would change and the layout of the hotel evolve , grow and shrink based on demand for accommodation the hotel would give brands an opportunity to advertise to the outside world as well as let people stay in a themed room			0
it is not known whether the price of advertising would subsidise the price of staying in such a hotel of the future the architects envision that in the future people could own containers that serve as mobile apartments or offices so that when they travel , their home could travel with them			2
here , a diagram shows how a metal container might slot into the main metal frame the winners of the @entity31 – which recognise ‘ concept deign , creativity and potential impact on the industry ’ - will be announced next month at the @entity153 in @entity154			2
the architects explained that the idea for their concept hotel ‘ lies in the idea of maximum flexibility and mobility , a trend that is embodied in our modern way of life ’			2
a container designed by a fashion brand might include decor echoing popular designs , while one imagined by a car company ( such as the concept pictured ) , could feature team colours and even a modified car as a piece of furniture here , the modular approach to the structure is explained			2
pre-decorated containers could be slotted into the metal frame and connected to hotel infrastructure so they could have access to water as well as stairs			0

@entity56 - based architects @entity54 said its concept could offer lots of advertising opportunities , although there are no plans to build the hotel yet
the design could also be *adapted* for emergency housing or medical care units as well as portable homes
