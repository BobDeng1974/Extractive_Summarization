he might be retiring from the @entity1 but it appears that prince @entity2 wo n't be ending all of his military commitments			1
today , the 30 - year - old royal revealed that he will be taking part in an epic 1,000 mile trek through the @entity7 as part of a fundraising drive for walking with @entity10			1
speaking during the launch of @entity12 at @entity14 's @entity13 , the prince said he was ' delighted ' to be taking part in the trek and is ' looking forward to it '			1
' the public ’s support for our @entity27 continues to be extraordinary , ' he said			0
' however , as the memory of our military commitments in @entity31 and @entity32 fade , we must encourage people to continue supporting our servicemen and women ; particularly those who are seeking to transition into civilian life			1
' this process can be challenging , as it is for anyone seeking a new career			0
as i make this transition myself , i 'm determined to do all i can to help others			0
' today 's visit to the @entity13 comes just 48 hours after @entity43 announced that he is to retire from the @entity1 after a 10 - year career that included two tours of duty in @entity32			0
@entity48 : despite announcing his retirement from the @entity1 , @entity2 was on typically cheeky form difficult : @entity2 spoke of his own plans and said making the transition to civilian life would be ' challenging ' expedition : @entity2 will join wounded servicemen for part of a 1,000 mile trek through the @entity7 announcement : @entity2 's plans were revealed less than 48 hours after it was announced he is leaving the @entity1 before he hangs up his boots , @entity2 will spend four weeks with the @entity62 , splitting his time between @entity64 , @entity65 and @entity66 , and will continue on to @entity67 for an official tour			1
much of the summer will be spend in @entity69 , where the @entity2 will occupy himself with charity work , much of it conservation focused , according to @entity43			1
returning to the @entity7 in the autumn , @entity2 will then join the core team of five wounded veterans taking part in the walk of @entity7 which gets underway on the 22nd august in @entity78			1
the epic trek , which , it is hoped , will result in wider public awareness of veterans ' needs , will end in @entity14 on the 31st october			2
unfazed : @entity2 smiled and clutched his speech as he listened to veterans talk about their experiences long association : @entity2 has accompanied injured servicemen on two previous expeditions one of the boys : @entity2 was on typically cheeky form and enjoyed chatting to soldiers at the reception @entity2 is no stranger to the charity 's lengthy expeditions , having previously taken part in walks to the @entity99 in 2011 and another to the @entity100 in 2013			1
for the latter , the @entity2 was joined by a star - studded crew that included @entity105 actor @entity104 , as well of wounded veterans - some of whom were at the @entity13 for the launch			2
watched by an audience that included walking with the @entity113 co-founder @entity112 , @entity2 made an impassioned speech about the need to help veterans and outlined his hopes for the trek			1
' @entity12 will cover all parts of the country , ' he explained			0
' walking through the communities in which our service personnel and veterans grew up and now live			0
' in doing so , @entity12 will give everyone the opportunity to meet these remarkable men and women			0
achievement : the five - strong team will walk 1,000 miles through the @entity7 , starting at the end of august helping out : @entity2 's last trek with @entity133 took him to @entity134 race : the 2013 expedition saw the prince join wounded servicemen as they walked to the @entity100 ' people up and down the country will get to see first - hand the determination and resolve of those who have served , and in particular those who have been injured or suffer hidden wounds			1
' they will see that whatever their circumstances these men and women are looking to the future			0
they are looking to employers to give them the chance to keep making a contribution to our communities			0
' these men and women want to continue to serve their country in whatever way possible			0
ptsd and mental injury can make life a daily struggle , but we should not assume that everyone leaving the military faces these challenges			2
' it 's also important to keep mental health issues in perspective			0
we should remind people that nearly all cases end well , whether it be total cure , adjustment of life , or the ability for the individual to accept and admit the issues that face them , amongst a tricky culture of stigma			2
involved : @entity2 , pictured arriving at the @entity13 , has long championed wounded soldiers projects : as well as @entity133 , he also spearheaded the @entity182 retirement : @entity2 will be seconded to the @entity184 for a month before he leaves the @entity1 ' it is a delicate balance between being ready to support those who need it and recognising the valuable role those who have served in the military can play in civilian life			1
' @entity2 's work with @entity193 echoes his previous efforts , most notably last year 's hugely successful @entity182			2
although the event will not take place this year , aides are keen to emphasise that prince @entity2 's championing of wounded servicemen will continue post-retirement			1
he will also continue to take part in military events , beginning with a trip to @entity203 next month to mark the centenary of the @entity206 campaign next month			2
the battle was one of the bloodiest of @entity209 and resulted in the deaths of approximately 43,000 @entity7 soldiers , 8,709 @entity212 and 2,721 @entity67			0
@entity2 , who will be based in @entity212 when the event takes place , will fly to @entity203 and will be joined by @entity215 for a memorial service .			0
