as the world spotlight shines on a @entity2 courtroom in the trial of the ' @entity4 ' @entity5 , hidden in the shadows are the forgotten women who served as guards at @entity10 ’s death camps			2
now , seven decades on and in the twilight of their lives , these former @entity12 guards who ruled the human slaughterhouse @entity13 with an iron fist will go to their graves having escaped justice			1
of the 3,700 women who served at @entity21 death camps , just three were investigated by prosecutors in @entity23 for their roles as accomplices to mass murder			2
those ' merciless ' women who traded femininity , motherhood and marriage to wed themselves to the dark side of @entity10 's @entity21 include @entity55 a guard at the notoriously brutal women ’s concentration camp of @entity32 , in northern @entity23 , she was remembered by survivors as a feared woman who beat prisoners and unleashed on them her alsatian dog			1
a fanatical @entity21 , the dog handler patrolled the camp with her @entity66 she had trained to bite at the inmates ' genitals			1
she was transferred to @entity13 where she and her teeth - baring dog were feared by the prisoners kept as slaves and worked in the sweatshop factories around the camp			1
one female prisoner after the war testified : ' there was a woman there with a kindly smile that masked a hideous nature			0
she was ramrod straight and had a snarling dog that was indoctrinated to hate the prisoners			2
' we would be forced to stand stock still for hours and if anyone moved in the cold or the heat , the dog was unleashed			0
many people did not survive the maulings			2
' brutal : the women patrolling the death camps were just as bad as their male counterparts			2
pictured : female overseers at @entity96 , having been taken prisoner by the @entity98 in april 1945 tortured : prisoners look out from behind a barbed wire enclosure at the @entity102 concentration camp - where 41,500 died - in @entity23 in 1945			1
they and their relatives look likely to never get the justice they deserve survivors : @entity108 prisoners pictured when the @entity21 concentration camp of @entity102 , near @entity110 , was liberated by @entity112 troops at the end of april 1945			1
many of the @entity21 guards got away with their crimes by claiming they were just following orders she began an affair with an @entity12 man while serving at the camp and was discharged from the service in 1943 when she fell pregnant			1
after the war , in @entity125 , which was behind the iron curtain , the communist authorities tried her for her wartime role and she was sentenced to 15 months in jail for ' mistreatment of and thefts from prisoners in her charge '			1
now 94 , she still lives in the state and refuses to speak about her terrible past			2
nevertheless , unlike 93 - year - old @entity5 , a former @entity12 sergeant being tried on 300,000 counts of accessory to murder , @entity29 has been told there is no case for her to answer			1
another to get off scot free is @entity35 , a ' hard - faced ' woman who worked in the feared @entity12 under her maiden name of @entity144			1
she was a harsh disciplinarian who beat prisoners as punishment for petty rule infractions			2
@entity35 was also in charge of the standing cells - small , dark rooms where up to 15 people at a time were crammed into			1
it was not uncommon for her to leave prisoners in these rooms for days on end , causing the death of some or all of those confined			1
@entity144 formed a romantic relationship with ss dr @entity159 but she abruptly ended it when he criticised the hideous experiments on prisoners carried out by notorious ' @entity163 ' dr @entity162 on inmates			1
she was a true believer in the @entity21 racial policies that decreed @entity47 , gypsies and @entity168 were ' lesser races ' who deserved nothing else			0
she appeared at the @entity172 of former guards and overseers in @entity175 in the 1960s - but escaped jail			2
and now prosecutors say she is also too old and frail to be tried in court			0
court : ss sergeant @entity5 , known as ' the bookkeeper of @entity13 ' , pictured during the war and today			0
he is charged with complicity in the killing of 300,000 @entity47 at the camp @entity5 , pictured , told the court that he is ' morally responsible ' for the mass slaughter even though he did not participate personally in any violence trial : people like @entity13 survivor @entity190 , left , from @entity192 and her 23 - years - old granddaughter @entity195 , have traveled from all over the world to witness one of the few prosecutions held possibly most frightening of all is @entity199 , who revelled in the power she yielded to play ' @entity201 ' in choosing who should live and who should be sent to the @entity13 gas chambers			1
now 92 , she was formerly an @entity12 guard at @entity205 in @entity206 , @entity207 , where an estimated 235,000 people were murdered during @entity42			1
prosecutors have traced her @entity12 identity card			2
the card , bearing the number 312 , has been authenticated , which proves she was there			0
it carries the inscription : ' the holder is authorised to bear arms ' - meaning she was a pay - grade above ordinary guards usually only sanctioned to carrying a ' schlagstock ' - a ' beating stick			0
' after service in @entity205 she was sent to @entity13 , where she was based at @entity13 - the gas chambers complex where 1.1million prisoners were exterminated			1
before the camp fell to the @entity229 she was shipped back to @entity23 and escaped justice at the end of the war			0
but officials at the @entity236 authority have , it is understood , testimony from several now deceased prisoners that she was a ' cruel ' and ' merciless ' guard who beat them with leather whips and who was present at the infamous railway ramp where daily ' selections ' were made about who should live - and who was to be gassed			1
now wheelchair bound , she was tracked down by the @entity2 daily newspaper , @entity248			0
her daughter said : ‘ we know that my mother had something to do with @entity13			0
we have tried to talk with her about it but her memory does n’t really function any more			0
’ a recent drive to find the last of the guards before they die of old age has seen posters put up around the country , and 30 arrests made in february of last year			0
and prosecutors have still to decide on his case and a handful of others , but few are convinced that justice will be done			0
to many , particularly @entity47 persecuted ruthlessly by the @entity269 , this is all a case of ' too little , too late '			0
according to historian @entity271 , of the 6,500 members of the @entity12 who served in @entity13 and survived the war , only 29 were convicted in @entity23 and reunified @entity23 , while about 20 were convicted in @entity274			2
efforts were no doubt hampered originally by the judiciary , police and civil service which were , in the post-war years , full of former @entity269			0
vicious : another was accused of making as many as 15 people stand for days on end in a tiny cell , a punishment which left people dead - but she will never be brought before the court to answer to the law getting away with it : of the 6,500 members of the @entity12 who served in @entity13 and survived the war , only 29 were convicted in @entity23 and reunified @entity23 , while about 20 were convicted in @entity274 ' unfortunately , very few people who committed the crimes had to pay for them , ' said @entity294 , the @entity295 's top @entity21 hunter			1
he added : ' the passage of time in no way diminishes the crimes ...			0
it 's only a shame that this kind of legal reasoning was not applied previously , because it would have led to many , many more cases of people who definitely deserved to be brought to justice			1
' @entity305 , the head of @entity23 ’s special prosecutor ’s office , which is responsible for investigating @entity21 era war crimes , who has worked to locate the remaining ss criminals and bringing them to justice 1986			0
' we owe it to the victims and to their families , " he said			0
" i want to do my job well for as long as it takes			0
the dead and the families of the dead deserve nothing less than to see justice done			0

@entity12 guard @entity325 trained her @entity66 to bite at inmates ' *private* parts
@entity35 locked up to 15 prisoners in a tiny ' standing cell ' for days
@entity199 revelled in the power of playing ' @entity201 ' with people 's lives
she picked who lived and who was sent to the gas chambers to die
but all three women - now frail and in their 90s - will never face justice
