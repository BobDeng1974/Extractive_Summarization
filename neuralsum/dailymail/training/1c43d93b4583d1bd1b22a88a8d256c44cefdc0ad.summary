' we darted her in the rump and moved off quickly to allow the drugs to take effect with minimal stress to the animal			0
' as we watched her fall asleep we noticed there was a " complication "			0
' there was one tiny cub on the slope near the adult and when we got closer there was another tiny cub in the shallow scraping under where she was sitting			0
