@entity0 has suffered from hair loss since his early twenties and today reveals the results of his third hair transplant			1
the celebrity big brother star , 33 , had two transplants but his hair continued to fall out , so he has now undergone his third in just two years			1
model @entity0 confesses that thinning locks ate away at his confidence until he could see no way out but to fork out on a third operation			1
the actor and reality star from @entity22 , @entity23 , says that without the surgical help , he would have lost most of the hair at the front of his scalp by now			2
speaking just before going on @entity28 's @entity5 , @entity0 said : ' there is no doubt this has changed my life			1
i have been losing my hair since my early 20s			1
' nature 's plan was for me to have thin and patchy hair across the top of my scalp			2
but the great thing is , we do n't have to follow nature 's plan			2
' hair transplant technology has improved so much in the last five years and i have been able to keep hold of all my hair and wear it in my the same way as i did when i was in my teens			1
' i was keen to get it done before going on celebrity big brother so my hair would look great on the show			2
' he had two transplants but his hair continued to fall out , so he has had a third in just two years			2
model @entity0 confesses that thinning locks ate away at his body confidence @entity0 had 1,200 grafts - around 2,200 individual hairs - moved from the side to the front of his scalp @entity0 has had all three procedures with hair transplant surgeon @entity62 at @entity64 in @entity65			1
dr @entity62 is the hair loss expert on the @entity68 medical show embarrassing bodies and he has also carried out two hair transplants on the programme 's presenter @entity71			1
@entity0 could have potentially slowed down his hair loss by taking the clinically proven hair loss drug @entity75			1
but two per cent of men who take the drug experience a dip in their sex drive - and @entity0 did n't want to take his chances			1
' it may only be two guys in a 100 but i did n't want to take the risk , ' he laughed			2
and although the costs are enormous , @entity0 said that keeping hold of his hair had done wonders for self - esteem - and has made him look five years younger			1
he said : ' no man wants to be bald when he is older			0
' losing your hair is one of the most demoralising things that can happen to a man as he ages			1
you do n't feel nearly as good about yourself and it eats away at your body confidence			2
' for me , i was worrying about my thinning hair when i was attending auditions			2
i would be thinking , " have they seen my hair ? are they going to give me the job ? " ' it was becoming a big distraction			2
' i 've read research saying that baldness can make men look 10 years older			0
i would say keeping hold of my hair has made me look at least five years younger			2
the difference in my self - esteem is immeasurable			0
' his hair was still receding in this area , particularly at the temples and @entity0 admitted that he would n't hesitate to have a fourth procedure if his hair loss continued			1
he said : ' i 'm not too interested in taking @entity75			0
hair loss is a continual process but i am hoping that mine will level off as i approach my mid- 30s			1
' i would have a fourth procedure			0
but let 's hope that is not necessary			0
' lots of other stars have had multiple procedures			0
@entity129 has had three and he looks amazing			0
' @entity130 has had two and it looks like he might well need a third			2
' @entity0 had 1,200 grafts - amounting to around 2,200 individual hairs - moved from the side to the front of his scalp where his hair is still receding , particularly at the temples			1
@entity0 pictured having a conversation with @entity142 on celebrity big brother yesterday @entity0 , pictured after the procedure , says losing his hair was demoralising dr @entity62 , who specialises in treating celebrities , said @entity0 had the same @entity147 technique as @entity148 captain @entity130			1
he said : ' what we 've noticed in the last five years is that the age of our patients is coming down all the time			0
a third of men suffer hair loss by the time they are 30			1
' more of them are deciding to have transplants immediately rather than waiting until middle age			0
why suffer 20 years of loss of confidence if you can sort your problem now ? ' for people in the public eye , their image is their career			0
you do n't see a lot of bald models or tv presenters			0
' a simple procedure such a hair transplant can make an enormous difference to a man 's life			1
' we have seen a lot of men " doing a @entity130 " and coming in for one , two or even three hair transplants like @entity0			1
bookings have gone up 25 per cent since @entity130 went public			2
' the star started losing his hair in his early 20s			2
pictured , left , before his first transplant and , right , after in october , @entity0 shaved off his enormous bushy beard as he prepared to undergo his third hair transplant in just two years			1
' losing that beard has taken a decade off me , ' he said			0
' there is no doubt a beard ages you			0
people associate them with middle - aged men			0
' the star has already had two hair transplant procedures after first losing his hair in his early 20s			1
he believes he damaged his hair follicles by pulling it back in a tight ponytail			2
he also thinks he hastened his hair loss by over-bleaching			1
before his third transplant @entity0 said : ' all the transplanted hair is permanent - the problem i have is that i am still losing my natural hair			1
' ' these procedures have completely changed my life			0
they have given me so much more confidence and enabled me to wear my hair just the way i like			0
' @entity62 from the @entity64 ( left ) @entity62 from the @entity64 in @entity65 , said : ' hair transplantation is the only method that is guaranteed to overcome hair loss and regain hair			1
medications can halt hair loss but they will not lead to the regrowth of lost hair			1
' there are two types of hair transplant			1
in both cases , transplantation can be done so well that often a barber or stylist can not even tell that grafts have been placed			0
the transplanted hair is permanent and in nearly all cases will stay in place for the rest of the patient 's life			0
' the most popular and cost - effective method is called @entity238 – popularly known as ' strip harvesting ' - where hair follicles are removed in a ' strip ' of skin from the back or side of the head and moved to the thinning areas at the top of the scalp			0
' the second technique is called @entity147			0
it is more expensive than strip harvesting and is the procedure which was used on @entity130 for both his hair transplants			1
the main difference is the hair follicles are removed and transplanted individually as opposed to in one single strip			0
it is more time consuming – and therefore more expensive – than strip harvesting			0
this method is particularly popular with men who like to keep their hair short because there is virtually no scarring			0
in @entity147 , or @entity147 , individual follicles are extracted directly from the back or side of scalp , usually one at a time			0
there will be some minor scarring – which looks like pin pricks – immediately after the operation but this disappears during the healing process which takes approximately 5 - 7 days after which any redness or slight swelling in the treatment area will have subsided			0
@entity279 had these red pin pricks at the back of his scalp following his @entity147 procedure earlier this year			0
@entity147 generally has a quicker patient recovery time and lower post-operative discomfort than strip harvesting			0
@entity0 also shaved off his beard as he prepared for his third hair transplant in two years			1

@entity0 , 33 , believes bleach and ponytails contributed to his hair loss
he has now had same £ 6,000 hair transplant as @entity130 three times
@entity0 has n't ruled out having a fourth transplant if he keeps losing his hair
