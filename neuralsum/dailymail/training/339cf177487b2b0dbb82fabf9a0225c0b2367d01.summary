@entity1 winger @entity0 scored twice as @entity2 booked their place in the semi-finals of the @entity6 by beating @entity7 3 - 0			1
@entity0 , who has scarcely played during his loan spell at @entity9 from @entity10 , struck his goals either side of one from @entity15 striker @entity14			1
the second in particular was a magnificent strike , as @entity0 cut in from the right wing and curled a beautiful dipping shot over the dive of @entity7 keeper @entity21 to make it 3 - 0			1
@entity2 's @entity0 ( second left ) celebrates scoring his side 's second goal in the 3 - 0 win over @entity7 the players celebrates their first goal as @entity2 comfortably cruised into the @entity6 semi-finals @entity0 ( left ) and @entity14 ( right ) run off in celebration following the former 's second goal @entity2 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity32 ; @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 ; @entity0 ( @entity37 79 mins ) , @entity38 ( @entity39 86 ) , @entity40 , @entity41 ( @entity42 90 ) ; @entity14 , @entity43			1
goals : @entity41 ( 4 , 61 ) , @entity14 @entity45 ( 4 - 5 - 1 ) : @entity46 ; @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 ; @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 ( @entity55 56 ) , a @entity48 ( @entity56 81 ) ; @entity57 ( @entity58 46 ) booked : @entity54 , @entity48 , @entity53 , @entity50 sent off : @entity59 93 @entity0 , despite his lack of playing time in @entity62 , is an established name in @entity2 , and has been a regular for @entity66 ’s side in @entity7			1
but for 24 - year - old striker @entity14 , on loan from @entity15 , this was his first international start , and it brought his first international goal			1
the @entity71 forward also helped provide another on his full debut , as the @entity2 saw off @entity7 with incredible ease			0
@entity2 were helped greatly by some woeful @entity45 defending , in particular for @entity14 ’s goal shortly before half - time			2
centre back @entity49 made such a hash of his clearance that it trickled straight into the striker ’s path on the edge of the box , and @entity84 , with no defenders in sight , finished coolly through @entity21 ’s legs			0
a fan waits for the start of the quarter - final match in @entity91 with ' 2015 ' glasses on his face @entity94 ( centre ) advances with the ball past @entity7 defender @entity50 ( right ) it was the crowning glory on an excellent display from the @entity100 - born forward , who also had a hand in the first goal , scored by @entity0 , in just the fourth minute			1
@entity14 drove at the @entity7 defence before feeding @entity41 in the box			0
the @entity106 forward took the ball away from goal before rolling it across the box , for @entity43			0
but despite the striker arriving ahead of the ball , it still arrived for @entity0 to convert emphatically at the far post			0
from that point on @entity2 were in control without ever having to get into top gear			0
guinea - who only reached the quarter - final through the random procedure of drawing lots - were disappointing from start to finish			2
they had promised to lift their @entity127 - ravaged nation with a win after their mid-week reprieve , but never looked capable of scoring			0
@entity2 's fans cheers for their team during the @entity6 quarter - final match on sunday @entity54 , excellent throughout the group stages , was extremely disappointing before being replaced shortly before the hour , while @entity136 , inexplicably preferred to @entity137 up front , was appalling until half - time , when he was hooked			1
even the usually lively @entity51 was strangely subdued , as the @entity140 failed to muster a single shot on target			0
to add insult to injury they had @entity21 sent off in stoppage time for bringing down @entity43 with a flying kick when the former @entity149 man was through on goal			2
@entity21 might have been shown a red card an hour earlier for a needless shove on @entity0 , so he could have few complaints about his late dismissal , which saw an outfield player between the posts for the final few seconds			2
@entity2 's players celebrate their second goal during the 3 - 0 victory over @entity7 in @entity91 on sunday the win will take @entity2 through to face hosts @entity7 , and barring complacency - or the sort of fortune that the home side enjoyed on saturday night in beating @entity167 - it is hard to see them failing to make the final now			1
it is a far cry from the shocking performances of the first two games , when @entity66 seemed unable to coax the best from his talented squad			0
but in @entity0 and @entity84 he seems to have found a new generation of threatening forwards			0
@entity7 defender @entity49 ( left ) and @entity2 's @entity43 ( right ) compete for the ball			2

@entity2 beat @entity7 3 - 0 at the @entity91 on sunday
the @entity2 progress to the semi-finals of the @entity6
@entity1 's @entity0 scored twice for @entity2 during quarter - final
@entity15 striker @entity14 got @entity2 's other goal
guinea *goalkeeper* @entity21 was also sent off in stoppage time
