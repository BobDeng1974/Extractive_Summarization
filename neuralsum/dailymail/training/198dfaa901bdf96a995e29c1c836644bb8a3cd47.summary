but @entity6 may not have been expecting this scathing verdict on his speech – from a rather bored looking schoolboy			2
the pupil made what appeared to be an obscene gesture with his middle finger yesterday as he sat through mr @entity6 ’s talk at his school			1
at other points in the speech , the ginger - haired boy seemed to have virtually nodded off			0
he was pictured with his eyes closed , resting his head in his hands			0
deputy prime minister @entity6 was setting out his plans for helping school leavers but the audience seemed unimpressed this pupil at @entity26 in @entity27 appeared to be sending a not - so - subtle message to the deputy pm dressed in a navy blazer and striped tie , he appeared to try to hide his middle - finger gesture by holding his hand against his face			1
it did not impress the girl sat next to him , however , who was seen giving him a dismissive look			0
mr @entity6 apparently did not notice			2
the @entity40 leader was making a speech to around 500 young people at @entity26 in @entity27			2
he announced that youngsters will be able to gain help at jobcentres from the age of 16 , but that jobless teenagers will be forced to improve their maths and @entity50 skills or lose their benefits the deputy prime minister said 18 - 21 - year - olds who left school without a grade c at @entity56 will be put on compulsory training courses as soon as they sign on to the dole			1
the crackdown is part of a package of measures aimed at preparing young people for the world of work , including better careers advice , more work experience and @entity69 helping under - 18s for the first time			1
one in seven young people in the @entity72 are not in school , work , or training , according to new figures released today			0
schools will be made to offer better careers advice while @entity69 will be able to help 16 and 17 - year - olds , mr @entity6 said the deputy prime minister 's speech struggled to inspire many students , but he ploughed on in total , 844,000 16 to 24 - year - olds are considered ' @entity86 ' - not in education , employment or training - although the numbers are falling , government data shows			1
the @entity92 said that the proportion of @entity94 in this age group is the lowest it has been since 2008			0
almost four in 10 16 - 24 year - olds do not have good qualifications in maths and @entity50			1
under new plans to prepare school leavers for work , 18 - 21 year olds signing on at @entity69 will have to prove their skills			1

the scheme will be piloted in @entity110 , @entity111 , @entity112 , @entity113 and @entity114 from this autumn , using both face - to - face training and online support			0
mr @entity6 said : ‘ from day one of signing up for unemployment benefit , these young people will need to show they have those @entity105 and @entity50 qualifications that every job demands			1
‘ if they do n’t , their adviser will get them on that training immediately to ensure that if you ’re not earning , you ’re still learning			0
‘ we ’re looking at using the latest online learning technologies , so you can fit this training around the other responsibilities in your life			0
‘ if you do n’t do this training , you wo n’t get your @entity133			0
’ if the young people then get a job , the training will continue to ensure they have the kills to progress in the workplace , mr @entity6 added			2
‘ if these pilots are successful , i want to see them rolled out across the country : putting earn or learn at the heart of the support we give you			0
’ for the first time @entity69 will also be told to help 16 and 17 - year - olds looking for work			1
mr @entity6 said rules banning advisers from working with under - 18s ‘ just seems wrong ’			2

careers advice for many teenagers is a ‘ tick box exercise squeezed into a lunchtime break ’ , mr @entity6 says			1
in a speech to around 500 young people at @entity26 , south @entity27 , mr @entity6 is unveiling measures which he says will help stop young people becoming ' neet ' ( not in education , employment or training )			1
he cites a recent @entity196 study which found that just one in five schools were giving all of their pupils detailed career support			0
mr @entity6 said : ‘ for a lot of the young people i meet , careers guidance currently feels like a tick box exercise squeezed into lunchtime break with a busy teacher , who no doubt already has a lot on their plate			2
‘ so , we are issuing new guidance for schools , in the next few weeks , that will set out just what good careers advice should look like			1
' and not take - it - or - leave - it guidance			0
to make sure it 's being followed , @entity196 will be looking more closely at the quality of careers advice and support available when they inspect schools			2
’ in 2010 , mr @entity6 angered students when he abandoned his general election pledge to vote against any increase in university tuition fees .			0
