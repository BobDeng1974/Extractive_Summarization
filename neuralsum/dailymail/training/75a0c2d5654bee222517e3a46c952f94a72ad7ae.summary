by @entity0 it may sound like a joke - a robotic stand - up comic winning a science photography prize			0
but it 's true , in a sense			0
an image of a robot performing a comedy routine in front of an audience has won the first @entity13 photographic competition			1
the show by @entity15 was part of a study called @entity18 : human vs robot , by @entity21 , a phd student at @entity22			1
competition winner : the picture called @entity25 , by @entity21 , a phd student at @entity22 the performance at @entity28 's @entity27 alongside comics @entity29 and @entity30 won the competition for photographs that demonstrate science in action			1
mr @entity21 , from @entity36 's cognitive science research group , used the robot alongside live comedians in a series of settings to research performer - audience interaction			1
mr @entity21 said he was thrilled to have won , and added : ' this ground - breaking research is helping us to understand both what makes for a great performance and what makes for a compelling audience experience			1
' we use new technologies to analyse people 's moment - by - moment responses , so while teaching a robot stagecraft was fun , it was the ability to read and react to the audience that made it work			2
' mathematical analysis can make you fly , by dr @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity61 , @entity62 , which got 1st place in the @entity65 section @entity66 in @entity67 , by mr @entity68 , @entity69 , which got second place in the innovation section @entity73 - huge advances on microscale level , by ms @entity75 , @entity76 , which won first place in the @entity79 section @entity15 is a @entity81 - made robot equipped with cameras , depth perception and facial recognition			2
it is capable of reacting to its audience and adapting its script accordingly			0
the battery - powered robots are produced in a factory in @entity92 , @entity93 , where it takes engineers around a week to build one of the human - like machines from scratch			0
a single robot starts at around Â£ 55,000 each			0
@entity15 can also be controlled remotely by people using a tablet in another room , while his facial expression can also be changed			2
other winners in the competition included pictures of an apparently levitating maths teacher , a 3 - d printer creating objects in bronze and an image of lung cancer cells			0
discovering , designing , developing together , by @entity113 , phd student with the @entity116 research group , @entity115 , which got second place in the @entity65 section manufactured with @entity119 , by dr @entity120 , a @entity121 at @entity122 , @entity123 ( @entity124 ) @entity125 , which got third place in the innovation section the deposition head and a complex hollow part being printed in bronze metal , this required firing in a kiln to produce a solid bronze part , by @entity134 , @entity135 , which got third place in the equipment section surprise ! wrinkles simulated by mr @entity140 , @entity141 , which got third place in the weird and wonderful section in the national science photography competition from nano - molecules to mega-structures , by dr @entity147 , the @entity148 , which got second place in the equipment section graphene @entity151 , by professor sir @entity152 , and dr. @entity153 , @entity148 , which got second place in the @entity156 section subterranean sampling , by dr @entity158 ( @entity159 ) , @entity148 , which got third place in the @entity156 section the @entity162 equation , by professor @entity163 , which got second place in the weird and wonderful section lung cancer cells taking up carbon nano - needles , by @entity168 and @entity169 , @entity28 , which got first place in the innovation section playing @entity172 , by dr @entity173 , @entity22 , which got third place in the @entity65 section @entity177 instability by @entity178 , @entity62 , which got first place in the @entity156 section			1
