a neighbour , who would not be named , said : ' it 's been hell living here for several years now and the worst of it is that the @entity28 actively promotes the barns for parties and weddings			1
' there have been more and more parties over the last few years and it 's getting to the stage that we are using the @entity49 's name in vain when we hear the music or the wedding speeches			1
' we do n't want to upset the church , but we do n't want drunken wedding guests wandering around shouting outside out houses			1
' locals claimed that another late night venue at the church would make things ' ten times worse '			1
churchwarden @entity0 admitted neighbours had ' good grounds ' for complaint and said church leaders are now investigating soundproofing at @entity23			0
he said : ' there is no argument - we completely agree with them			0

our acoustic consultants have advised us that we are now near a solution that will satisfy acoustic regulations			0

' but neighbours were furious the church had also applied to host parties at the nearby @entity108 which is normally used for children 's parties			2
@entity111 , whose home @entity113 is opposite the church , said said : ' the use as a church is not a problem - it 's all these events they have - we hear the music the whole time			0
' they have a terrace at the back which people sit out on and we get a lot of noise and disturbance from that			0
' he added the late licence application , if approved , would make the noise ' ten times worse '			1
' we would have people not just on the terrace but milling around between the two buildings with no enclosure to mute it , ' he added			0
another neighbour , who did not want to be named , said : ' it 's been like living opposite a nightclub			2
' it sometimes feels like we 're actually in there , being able to hear the words of every song , and the doors and windows shaking from the heavy bass			0
' it 's been stressful for us all knowing we have weekend after weekend of disturbance to endure and sometimes just not wanting to be at home at a time when we should be able to relax			0
' @entity153 have also lodged their objections with concerns over noise and traffic			0
the local district council has given @entity159 until wedding season to sort out the noise issues , with church leaders promising to investigate soundproofing			0
