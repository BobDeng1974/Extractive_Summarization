@entity4 is normally administered by a doctor to a patient with a valid prescription after a face - to - face consultation			2

it is thought the 51 - year - old , who lives in a £ 4million townhouse in @entity28 , @entity29 , made more than £ 1million from the scam the 2012 @entity33 investigation alleged @entity6 told nurses to use @entity4 prescribed for one patient on another and actively encouraged them to not pay adequate regard to a patient ’s medical history before administering the jabs			1
the millionaire – who also owns a six - bedroom @entity73 mansion with a nearby private stable for his seven polo ponies and properties in the @entity77 including a £ 1million chalet and a hotel – boasted in his company newsletter that he carried out 50,000 remote prescriptions , suggesting he made £ 1.5million from the phone calls alone			2
his company , one of the @entity86 ’s largest purchasers of @entity4 , charged patients from £ 200 for a treatment			0
he was filmed telling nurses : ‘ strictly speaking , a vial with a patient name on should only be used on that patient			0
we use it on a number of people			0
is it ever an issue ? no. it is not legal but it ’s what everybody does , doctors , professors , me			0
just order a vial in your name – it ’s not policed at all			0
’ @entity6 also suggested that if nurses could not contact him before giving @entity4 they should go ahead and he would authorise it afterwards			2
he was condemned for his ‘ flippant , cavalier and deplorable ’ attitude at a @entity108 for carrying out the training courses at his @entity11 clinic ( pictured ) suspending him following a hearing in @entity113 , the panel said : ‘ the findings against dr @entity6 are wide - ranging , some are repeated and involve the potential to place patients at risk of harm			1
his conduct ... could properly be described as deplorable			0
’ in a letter to the panel , dr @entity6 said : ‘ i can understand that on a busy ward with lots of different vials and lots of different patients , to use vials between patients would be dangerous			1
' however , in the context of @entity4 where you have a single practitioner administering a single medication to one patient at a time , i would contend that that is not dangerous , but i have not been accused of doing it			0
i do not encourage nurses to do that			0
’ in the wake of the investigation into @entity6 , the @entity144 has banned doctors from remotely prescribing cosmetic injections such as @entity4 , meaning they must hold a face - to - face consultation .			2
