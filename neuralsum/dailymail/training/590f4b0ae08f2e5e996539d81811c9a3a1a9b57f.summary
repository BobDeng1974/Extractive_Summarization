at every @entity3 game this season , @entity1 's scouts have monitored @entity6 's every move			1
where he goes , they go			0
from the moment his season began with two goals against @entity12 , the @entity9 striker has been on the wishlist of @entity14			1
since then he has gone on to score 35 times for @entity3 as they power their way towards the @entity18 title and the @entity20 final			2
now he is right at the very top of it			0
they hope that @entity6 , who is leaving the @entity36 after the @entity20 final on may 24 , will lift the curse of the @entity1 striker			1
since @entity41 bought the club in 2003 , they have been through every striker in every major league across @entity45			1
arguably only @entity46 , who struck the winning penalty against @entity48 in the 2012 @entity20 final , is the only real success			2
over the years @entity41 has thrown nearly £ 200million at the problem			2
big man : at 6ft 3in @entity6 has no problem going toe - to - toe with the likes of @entity56 shove off : @entity6 confronted @entity56 during the first leg at the @entity36 @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity46 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity72 are among the imports			1
among that lot , @entity46 is way out in front			2
in the history of the @entity78 , only three @entity1 players have won the golden boot as the leading goalscorer			2
@entity82 - @entity81 scored 23 times in 2000 - 01 , but the @entity85 forward was before @entity41 ’s time			1
@entity46 won it twice ( 2007 and 2010 ) and @entity64 held off @entity88 to win it in 2009 , just four months after his £ 15m move from @entity91			0
it is @entity41 ’s dream to bring in a forward that he can drool over when he makes those occasional appearances in his executive box on the halfway line at @entity97			1
@entity98 knows , he has tried enough times			0
next season @entity14 , who has complained throughout the season about the quality of his strikeforce , has promised him that @entity6 will be the answer			1
although his accidentally - on - purpose criticism of his strikers with @entity106 + was made public , he had been complaining about his forwards long before that was aired			0
it was in the coaches ’ room at @entity111 , minutes after @entity1 ’s 3 - 1 victory at @entity113 , when @entity14 complained bitterly to those present about their class			1
in games against @entity48 in the @entity118 and @entity119 in the @entity120 at the @entity121 , @entity67 was the only orthodox striker to score for the club			2
@entity67 , @entity71 and @entity72 , signed in an emergency on august 29 when @entity124 went into financial meltdown , had yet to get off the mark in the @entity78			0
@entity14 wanted to address it and @entity6 ’s arrival , for a fee of £ 32m , is believed to be the answer			1
@entity6 has impressed @entity1 ’s scouting department and number crunchers at the club are convinced he will be the answer next season			1
not the player he once was : @entity67 has failed to justify his £ 50m transfer fee flops : strikers @entity62 ( left ) and @entity60 ( right ) were failures at @entity1 moved on : @entity66 is another front man who failed to live up to expectations at @entity97 his development has been remarkable , returning from a successful loan spell at @entity144 in 2012 to get his career at @entity3 underway			1
he is the first of a couple of arrivals that @entity14 is convinced will turn @entity1 into genuine challengers for the @entity78 and @entity20 next season			1
at 6ft 3in , @entity6 can look after himself in the heat of battle			0
this guy is not afraid to tread on a few toes			0
in the @entity36 , in the first leg of the @entity20 semi-final against @entity1 , @entity6 deliberately thrust his chest into @entity56 during the opening exchanges			1
it was a mild incident , easily missed , but it showed that @entity6 is not afraid of the physical side of the game			0
next season , when combat starts in the @entity78 , those qualities will come in handy			0
big shoes to fill : @entity46 is the only striker to have achieved true success in the @entity41 era get me a goalscorer ! @entity14 has lamented the quality of his strikeforce this season he is not a technical player and it may take time for him to settle into @entity9 ’s system at the @entity176			1
@entity6 ’s debut for @entity179 ’s side , against @entity180 in the @entity181 in february , was uneventful			0
some at @entity1 still needed convincing but @entity1 are not the type of team to have possession for possession ’s sake			0
under @entity14 , they have a different way of playing			0
next season the team will be set up around @entity6 , programmed to deliver the ball into the penalty area			2
from there , he is exceptional			0
he shows no fear , instantly grabbing the ball at @entity97 in the @entity20 semi-final second leg after substitute @entity72 had tripped him			0
from the penalty spot , @entity6 put @entity3 into a 60th minute lead with a drilled effort into the top corner of @entity202 ’s net			1
that finished off @entity1 , but even then he knew where he would be playing his football next season			2
this time , they hope to strike lucky .			0

@entity1 want to sign @entity6 from @entity3
@entity14 has *targeted* @entity6 for the entire season
@entity211 boss is frustrated with club 's lack of *firepower*
@entity41 has suffered succession of flops among big - name strikers he has bought , *including* @entity62 and @entity67
@entity1 hope @entity6 can emulate @entity46 's feats at @entity97
