by @entity0 published : 20:46 est , 25 february 2014 @entity2 : 06:11 est , 26 february 2014 ambition : unite leader @entity4 told @entity5 he feels union influence on @entity7 is imperative @entity9 's controversial reform of @entity7 's structures will allow the unions to tighten their grip on the party , @entity4 boasted last night			1
mr @entity4 , militant boss of the giant @entity15 union , said he ' certainly ' expected to emerge with more power from a set of reforms that are meant to convince voters that @entity7 is not simply doing the bidding of its union paymasters			1
mr @entity9 pledged to shake up @entity7 's links with the unions last year in the wake of the @entity26 vote - rigging scandal , when @entity15 was accused of trying to fix the selection of a new candidate for the safe @entity7 seat			1
a watered - down package of reforms is set to be rubber - stamped by party chiefs at a special conference this weekend , although they will not be phased in programme fully for five years			0
but mr @entity4 told the @entity34 's @entity5 that he expected the reforms to give the unions ' more influence ' in the running of the party than they have already			1
asked if @entity15 could emerge with more power , he said : ' we certainly could , if we work hard enough , and @entity15 intends to , we intend to go out and persuade our members actively to a whole host of different mediums to join the @entity7 ... because of course we believe that in recent years the party has lost the values that trades unionists bring to the party and we want to have more influence in the party			2
' he said it was now ' central to @entity15 's political strategy ' to persuade activists to sign up for a new category of ' affiliate ' membership of @entity7 , which will give them full voting rights on a par with mps in leadership elections			1
the intervention is deeply unhelpful for mr @entity9 , who has repeatedly denied @entity63 claims that his reforms are a sham that will increase the influence of the unions rather than curb it			2
@entity69 chairman @entity68 last night seized on mr @entity4 's comments as evidence that the reforms would have little more than a cosmetic impact			0
' the unions still dictate @entity7 's policy , push the leader around and choose the candidates , ' mr @entity68 said			2
' @entity9 is too weak to stand up to his union paymasters and therefore will never be able to stand up for the hardworking people of @entity80			0
' his words come as @entity7 leaders , such as @entity9 and @entity83 , intend to show their distance concerns : @entity4 said he feels talk of a @entity88 coalition shows the party is losing its roots in a further flexing of muscles , mr @entity4 also warned mr @entity9 to rule out a post-election coalition with the @entity94			1
mr @entity4 , whose union is @entity7 's biggest donor , said : ' one of the things that people are looking for is something different and i 'm afraid that the reason why politicians are not particularly popular at the moment is people do n't see any differences so i think they 're looking for people who have courage of their convictions			2
' @entity7 , i hope , win the next election outright , but if they are the biggest party then my view is @entity9 should have the courage of his convictions and govern on a minority government			0
' the real test comes in 2015 when the @entity80 people have chosen , and my advice , my view is that @entity9 should n't be sucked into a @entity88 pact , he should have the courage of his convictions if we are the largest party , he should govern			0
' and he should challenge those coalition parties to bring him down if necessary and go back to the people so that there 's a stark alternative			0
' his comments come amid reports that @entity126 is preparing to rule out a future coalition with @entity128 .			0

unite leader @entity4 says reforms will give unions more influence
activists signing up as @entity7 members now ' central strategy ' , he said
@entity9 pledged to shake up links in wake of @entity26 vote - rigging scandal
@entity4 also issues call for @entity9 to rule out coalition with @entity94
