by @entity0 published : 14:38 est , 21 october 2013 updated : 19:20 est , 21 october 2013 @entity1 has been accused of unnecessarily hiking their prices in @entity3 by the country 's state - controlled media			1
in a seven - minute report aired by television channel cctv , broadcasters claimed a tall latte in @entity10 is more expensive than in @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13			1
but the worldwide coffee chain dismissed the damning report , saying you can not compare different markets			1
the story on sunday gave the price of a @entity10 latte as 27 yuan ( $ 4.42 ) , compared with 24.25 yuan ( $ 3.97 ) in @entity11 , 19.98 yuan ( $ 3.26 ) in @entity12 and 14.6 yuan ( $ 2.39 ) in @entity13			1
under attack : this @entity1 coffee house in @entity10 is one of many that supposedly mark up their lattes it follows a stream of attacks on the @entity29 - based firm from @entity3 's state - run newspaper @entity30 , accusing it of ' profiteering '			1
the publication 's latest article on the topic was headlined : ' @entity1 ca n't justify high prices in @entity3			2
' analysts say the recent outcry is partly an official response to public frustration over high prices for imported goods			0
but it is one of many attacks on overseas firms , that experts warn will raise alarm in the international business community			0
@entity10 - 27 yuan ( £ 2.74 ) @entity11 - 24.25 yuan ( £ 2.46 ) @entity12 - 19.98 yuan ( £ 2.03 ) @entity13 - 14.6 yuan ( £ 1.48 ) earlier this year , @entity49 tech giant @entity48 was accused of ' unparalleled arrogance ' towards @entity3 customers in a barrage of attacks earlier this year by state media			1
the criticism stopped after @entity48 ceo @entity56 apologised			0
foreign baby food manufacturers and pharmaceutical firms have also been targeted by authorities over allegations of price - fixing and corruption over the past year			2
the media focus on @entity1 was because ' most probably @entity1 is the biggest and most famous ' coffee chain in @entity3 , said @entity65 , managing director of the @entity66			1
' for the past few months , i 've been very concerned about ... any foreign - owned company , because it looks like the local government is trying to do something to restrict foreign companies , ' he added			0
in a statement , @entity1 said that its pricing in different cities is based on a variety of factors , including infrastructure investment , real estate , currency valuation and labour costs			2
' each @entity1 market is unique and has different operating costs , so it would be inaccurate to draw conclusions about one market based on the prices in a different market , ' the company said			2
outrage : according to the report , a tall latte from this @entity11 outlet is 28p cheaper than coffees in @entity3 ' we continue to be humbled by the support we have received from our customers and the relevant authorities within the @entity3 government , ' it added			1
but on its verified account on @entity3 's hugely popular microblogging site @entity102 , it posted a photo of a pencil with a toy horse on its end - a visual pun on a highly offensive @entity3 obscenity			0
@entity1 opened its doors in @entity3 in 1999 and now has more than 1,000 stores in the country and growing			2
@entity3 is likely to overtake @entity111 as @entity1 ' second - largest market after the @entity49 next year , and it is aiming to reach 1,500 stores by 2015 , according to a spokeswoman			1
analysts said price differences could be explained not only by @entity1 ' varied operating costs across the globe but also by the different role the coffee chain plays in the lives of @entity3 consumers			1
in the @entity49 , @entity1 gets much more of its revenue from takeaway sales			2
but in @entity3 most business comes from customers who take their time inside the store , noted @entity130 , a senior analyst with the @entity132 - based @entity131			0
other cases : @entity48 ceo @entity56 also had to answer to attacks from @entity3 state - run media after being accused of poor customer treatment earlier this year			0
pharmaceutical firms have also been targeted ' in @entity3 , it 's a different positioning and a different value proposition , ' he said			0
' they invest more in making these stores themselves more premium options and making more of the environments as well			0
' one new location opened in @entity10 last month is a glistening two - storey , 24 - hour store featuring live music at the weekend			1
@entity65 noted that while @entity1 ' prices may be cheaper outside @entity3 , they are on a par with - and in some cases , cheaper than - those of its foreign competitors within @entity3			1
some internet users mocked the @entity158 report			0
' the price of housing , cars and gasoline , internet service and taxes in @entity3 are all more expensive than in other countries , ' argued one @entity102 user			0
' why ca n't @entity1 be more expensive , too ? '			0
