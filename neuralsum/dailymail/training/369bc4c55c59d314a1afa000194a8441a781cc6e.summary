come rain , shine or snow , a military enthusiast has found a way of making sure his children always get to school on time - by dropping them off in his 17 tonne tank			1
@entity9 , owner of @entity11 driving events company , regularly drives around his sons @entity13 , 13 , and @entity14 , 16 , in one of his impressive fleet of more than 120 military vehicles , worth £ 2million			1
the 53 - year - old from @entity19 , said people often did a double take when they saw him driving one of his road legal tanks , many of which weigh more than 17 tonnes , around town at speeds of up to 40mph			2
they ca n’t believe it , and when they see the tax disc which verifies it ’s road legal , they ’re even more gobsmacked , ' he said			0
' my children love it , the tanks are a bit of a tourist attraction , but i can imagine they 're probably even a bit bored of it now , it 's just the norm for them			2
' ' their friends ca n't get enough of it though ; i just think all the attention is funny			0
' when taking his sons for a spin to school , the dad - of - two will often drive his 17 tonne @entity70 armoured personnel carrier - which mot exempt - instead of a car , teasing police and stunning follow motorists by revving its eight litre , two stroke engine and intimidating passers - by with its sheer enormity			1
@entity14 and @entity13 's school friends were blown away by the family 's unusual mode of transport to the school gates @entity9 said his children love the tanks but admitted they might even be a little bored by the vehicles which the boys simply considered ' the norm ' both of his sons have been driving tanks themselves since the age of eight at the family 's private farm the 17 tonne @entity70 armoured personnel carrier ( pictured ) has an eight litre , two stroke engine and is mot exempt everyone is desperate for a ride in the tanks which make up his fleet of more than 120 military vehicles , especially his sons , who have both been driving tanks on his private farm since they were eight			1
tanks are able to be declared road legal once owners de-activate any weapons and fit road - ready rubber tracks			0
if the armoured personnel carrier is over 25 years old it does not require an @entity112			2
dependent on size , weight and intended usage , vehicles can also be road tax exempt			2
a special h driving licence is then required to drive on @entity121 roads			0
@entity9 said : ' when we drive through town , everyone waves as if their hands are going to drop off			0
' the police often grin or look the other way and most of them do n't know what to do , it 's not every day you see a tank rolling into town			0
' all the children love to take pictures			0
it 's sometimes difficult when i drive it down hills , we 'd had some close calls , and i took the fuel cap off a bus once when it got too close			0
' but in my 20 years driving tanks i 've never had one crash , i 'm always extremely careful , especially with the kids			1
' tank collector @entity9 bought his first armoured vehicle , a @entity148 for £ 1750 , more than 20 years ago			1
since then , he has amassed a fleet of more than 95 operational tanks - the most valuable being a 1948 @entity151 worth an estimate £ 50,000 - which he uses on his off road military fun park at @entity155 , @entity156			2
the armoured vehicles have been used for weddings , funerals , in films , stag and hen parties			1
most recently , one full size army tank was driven down @entity164 as part of the dvd and blu - ray release of @entity168 3			0
but for @entity9 , running his children to school , or even taking a trip to the shops in an armoured vehicle has become the norm			1
the military enthusiast admitted he had the occasional close call when driving the tanks but said in 20 years , he had never had one crash one of those ' close calls ' came after he accidentally took the fuel cap off a bus while driving when it got too close but he said he was always extremely careful tank collector @entity9 bought his first armoured vehicle , a @entity148 for £ 1750 , more than 20 years ago , and since then , he has amassed a fleet of more than 95 operational tanks he uses some of his off road military vehicles in a military fun park at @entity155 , in the village of @entity188 , in @entity19 he said : ' my partner @entity189 and kids are very supportive with all of them getting stuck in and helping out and getting involved on the farm			1
' my partner even instructs sometimes , but i think she likes the more glamorous jobs , such as the film shoots and corporate events			0
' but despite what people think , i 'm not from a military background ; my interest in tanks was a spur of the moment fascination			0
' i bought my first tank 20 years ago and it just snowballed from there			1
