by @entity0 published : 12:30 est , 14 june 2013 updated : 12:40 est , 14 june 2013 queen of shops @entity2 has condemned the government over a decision to allow @entity6 to build a vast new supermarket on the seafront at @entity9			1
the retail guru , who was hired by @entity11 to find ways to rescue dying town centres like @entity9 , described the decision as ‘ a very sad day ’			1
she has become an outspoken champion of small retailers and fought to try and revive town centres ravaged by the impact of large supermarkets			1
battle : retail guru @entity2 has been hired to revive @entity22 's ailing high streets however , she has effectively been overruled by the equally combative @entity23 , the secretary for communities and local government , who has approved the @entity9 scheme			1
the new @entity6 , which had been fought by local residents and traders , will be a massive 82,000 square feet and sit on what is a key site on the seafront			1
the news will confirm suspicions that the original decision to hire @entity2 was more of a publicity stunt than a genuine attempt to help struggling high streets			2
for her key recommendations , which included cutting business rates and putting a brake on new shopping centres , have both been rejected			0
threat : @entity2 argues that places like @entity9 need to be protected from the impact of large supermarkets so that small businesses have a fighting chance rather a penny - pinching and lack lustre funding scheme , called the @entity2 , has been set up to give small grants to a few town centre committees to support things like local markets			1
last night , she condemned mr @entity23 ’ decision to back the scheme , saying : ‘ this is a sad day for @entity9			2
‘ the time , energy and genuine care the people of @entity9 have put into rebuilding their high street is being completely undermined by the @entity62 , @entity23 mp who has signed off an 82,000 square feet edge - of - town @entity6 development			1
‘ if government really believes in town centre first , how can they do this ? ’ she was selected by the prime minister to front a review of high streets on the strength of her record as a @entity78 tv presenter , where she was shown helping small independent traders turn around failing businesses			2
overruled : secretary of state for communities @entity23 mp has signed off an 82,000 square feet @entity6 development in @entity9 despite miss @entity85 ' protestations however , it is clear that she has been left disappointed by the outcome of an initiative that has been dismissed by retail industry experts as mere window dressing			1
‘ i did this in between running a business , in between filming and having a family			0
you try your best … i just wish i had been better advised , ’ she said			0
in april , miss @entity2 accused the former @entity6 boss , sir @entity98 , of talking ‘ crap ’ when he described the rise of supermarkets as progress			1
she said : ‘ that 's absolutely crap			0
what happens is that 50p of every pound is spent on food			0
if you take that off the high street and put it into a 40,000ft out - of - town store and you provide free parking and everything under one roof , then you start to take away not only the food shops , but also the chemist , the fashion shops , the butcher … you start to displace the whole high street			0
’ one episode of her @entity78 tv series ‘ @entity121 of the @entity122 ’ involved focusing on @entity9 and breathing new life in to its shopping streets			2
last year , she told residents she was keen to help their fight against @entity6 , saying she was ‘ passionate ’ about the effects of big stores diverting business away from high streets			2
expertise : @entity11 hired miss @entity2 to be his retail expert back in 2011 , charged with tackling the decline of towns all around @entity22 miss @entity2 wrote to mr @entity23 last year urging him to reject the @entity6 plan which she described it as a ‘ disturbing threat ’ to @entity9			1
retail expert , @entity139 , the former chief executive of @entity140 , described the news on @entity142 as a ‘ slap in the face for @entity85 ’			0
local trader @entity145 , former chairman of the @entity146 , said he feared a lot of smaller businesses could end up closing as a result of the new @entity6			1
‘ i do n't think it 's good for our seafront at all ... i 'm sure it 's going to take business away from coffee shops , local cafes , and things like that , ’ he said			0
designer @entity159 is at the forefront of a campaign to redevelop @entity9 ’s seafront around a heritage - themed amusement park			1
the new @entity6 store would sit alongside this and could , in theory , wreck the design			2
regeneration : designer @entity159 is also supposed to be saving @entity9 's town centre with a heritage - themed amusement park mr @entity159 said he hoped @entity6 could be persuaded to give its store a vintage feel			1
‘ we will kick them in the b * * * * * * * until they say they will , ’ he said			0
a letter to the developers from mr @entity23 ’ department said the supermarket plan was ‘ acceptable ’ and ‘ would perform the economic , social and environmental roles of sustainable development towards which it aims ’			0
while the government has given its approval , the application is still at the centre of a judicial review supported by residents which could overturn the decision			0
@entity6 said : ‘ @entity6 is a tenant in this developer - led project			0
the developer ’s application is now subject to a judicial review			0
we look forward to the outcome			0

an 82,000 square foot @entity6 is arriving in @entity9 , outraging @entity2
miss @entity2 was hired by @entity11 to champion small businesses
