by @entity0 last updated at 8:51 am on 26th october 2011 @entity2 could have let @entity2 live if he had wanted to , a court heard today			1
instead he held her by the throat until she fell limp in his hands , jurors at @entity5 were told			1
in a closing speech to jurors , prosecutor @entity11 said the 33 - year - old could have just walked away			1
closing speeches : jurors will hear the final prosecution and defence cases in the murder trial of @entity2 , right , who has already admitted killing @entity2 inside her flat he insisted that when @entity20 went to miss @entity22 's flat in @entity23 , @entity5 , he had sex on his mind			1
mr @entity26 told jurors that , once inside her home , there was a struggle - denied by @entity20 - as miss @entity22 fought for her life			1
' to accept it , it means he had to overcome her , he had to be stronger and maintain his purpose to ensure she did not escape , ' mr @entity26 said			2
' he knew what he was doing			2
he was in control and he knew she would die and he held her neck long enough , and coupled with a smothering second hand , to be sure that she would			2
' it goes to his intent and his intention to kill or cause really serious bodily harm			2
' family : @entity2 , mother @entity47 , father @entity48 , left , boyfriend @entity49 , second left , and brother @entity50 arrive at court today killer : a prison van carrying defendant @entity20 arrives at @entity5 today mr @entity26 went on : ' he knew she was struggling and fighting , he knew she was in pain , he knew she was frightened , he knew she could n't breathe			1
' instead of letting go and releasing his grip and letting her live , he carried on and on and on until she went dead in his hands , her life extinguished			2
' during mr @entity26 's speech , @entity20 did not look up from the dock , instead staring at the floor and keeping his head in his hands			1
miss @entity22 's parents , @entity48 and @entity47 , her brother @entity48 and boyfriend @entity49 sat quietly in the front row of the public gallery , as they have done throughout the trial			2
on occasions mrs @entity22 looked tearful			2
@entity2 , 33 , denies @entity75 's murder but has admitted her manslaughter			2
during the trial at @entity5 the @entity78 engineer described his actions as ' horrendous ' as he showed jurors with his own hand how he strangled his next - door neighbour			1
@entity20 said he had been attracted to 25 - year - old @entity22 and ' made a pass at her ' when she invited him in to her flat in @entity23 , @entity5			2
the prosecution maintain @entity20 's assault was sexually motivated - an accusation rejected by the defence			1
mr @entity26 said today that @entity20 had intended to kill the landscape architect or cause her really serious harm because he gripped her throat for long enough and hard enough to end her life			2
' twenty seconds is a long time , ' mr @entity26 said			1
girlfriend : @entity20 pictured with his girlfriend @entity95 at @entity96 ' whatever , in fact , the period of time was - it might have been less , it might have been more , perhaps 15 seconds , 20 seconds or 30 seconds - but it is a long time when you have your hands around the throat of another person			1
' it is when someone has their hands around your throat and they are squeezing and squeezing to such an extent that you can not breathe			0
' @entity2 knows how long he held her throat , you may think			0
' every second means a continued determination to kill			0
it is not a few seconds but a significant period of time			1
' it is long enough and hard enough , a sustained , continuous period of pressure of sufficient force to cause the body to react as it does			0
' it is a long time to imagine the holding of a neck , the sounds , the fight , the fear in the eyes of the victim - all directed at @entity2			1
' because he was facing @entity2 all until the person goes limp			0
' it is a long time to hold anyone forcefully , yet alone around the neck			1
' it takes no time to realise what consequences are from what the person holding your neck is intent on doing			1
' mr @entity26 said strangulation was not something done on the ' @entity148 '			1
' there is no use of a weapon , a knife or a blunt instrument but a hand , ' he told jurors			1
' it brings a unique connection between the attacker and the victim			0
the two people are joined in the moments leading up to death			1
' the hand of the attacker feeling the neck of his victim			0
' the other hand smothering her mouth - the distance perhaps the length of @entity2 's arm			0
' it is a method of killing that takes time and it is n't done in the spur of the moment			1
' it is not instantaneous , unlike the insertion of a knife			0
' it is protracted and it is persistent and it requires quite deliberate acts and a determination to carry on and carry on despite the reaction and the actions of the victim			0
' it involves a deliberate choice to rule out the decision to stop and release the grip			0
' you carry on until the person presumably in your hand , after the person has stopped , you let them fall to the ground			0
' together : @entity2 and her boyfriend @entity49			0
miss @entity22 ' father @entity48 and mr @entity49 watched intently earlier in the trial as @entity20 told a jury he had not been sexually aroused as he killed her mr @entity26 described @entity20 as ' shrewd ' and accused him of making ' careful decisions '			1
' @entity2 is very clever , he is intelligent , ' he told jurors			1
' there is another side to @entity2			0
he is dishonest , deceitful and he is a liar			1
' mr @entity26 also accused @entity20 of making up his recollections of the night of december 17 last year to match his account			0
he told jurors that when @entity20 gave evidence , he answered ' ca n't remember ' to more than 80 questions from him			1
jurors have been told miss @entity22 suffered 43 separate injuries when she was attacked			1
defence qc @entity216 closed his case yesterday and addressed the jury today after prosecutor mr @entity26 had spoken			1
he said he was not going to excuse the defendant 's actions and appealed to the jury to reach a verdict based on the evidence alone			1
' i am not going to ask you to excuse his conduct after the killing , there can be no excuse , ' mr @entity216 said			1
' if either of us set out to win a popularity contest , i would lose and rightly so			0
mr @entity216 called @entity20 's behaviour ' dreadful ' and added : ' but it does not alter what was in his mind at the time it happened			2
' there is only one thing that i can ask and that is a verdict based on the evidence heard in this court , nothing more , nothing less			2
' mr @entity216 said jurors should reject the prosecution assertion that miss @entity22 's death was ' planned , premeditated and sexually motivated ' as the evidence did not support it			1
he said the prosecution case could not explain how @entity20 had got inside miss @entity22 's flat and suggested the defendant 's evidence of being invited in was correct			2
mr @entity216 said prosecution claims that @entity20 had picked up miss @entity22 's cat and taken it back to her flat were not supported by the evidence			0
' that goes a long way to destroy the suggestion that this killing was planned , ' mr @entity216 said			1
the barrister also asked the jury to accept @entity20 's view that miss @entity22 's death happened after 9.35pm and not shortly after she arrived home at 8.45pm			2
he said the witness reports of screams coming from @entity265 were more likely to be students celebrating the end of term than miss @entity22 's desperate fight for life			0
' these noises had nothing to do with this case at all			0
they are certainly a red herring , ' he said			0
mr @entity216 said the attack on miss @entity22 was very short and the jury should not hold it against @entity279 that he could not recall every detail when giving evidence			0
' i am going to invite you to conclude this was a very short , fast - moving incident which would have been over in less than 30 seconds , ' mr @entity216 said			0
' that is what this case is about - whether or not @entity2 had formed an intention to kill or cause serious harm to @entity2			0
' there was a few seconds of madness			0
' we would invite you to say the fact he can not provide a second - by - second account in what happened in that fast - moving , dynamic situation is really not surprising			0
could you really expect it of anyone ? ' mr @entity216 concluded : ' we invite you to reject the prosecution 's suggestion this was planned , to reject their suggestion it was premeditated , to reject their suggestion it was sexually motivated , and to reject their suggestion she was killed at about 8.40pm			1
' we invite you to come to the conclusion that the evidence points to it being unplanned , unpremeditated , without sexual motivation and with death occurring after 9.35pm			2
' the trial was adjourned until tomorrow when the judge , mr @entity318 , will begin summing up			0
landscape architect @entity22 was last alive on the evening of december 17 last year			0
she was reported missing two days later when her boyfriend @entity49 returned to their ground floor flat in @entity265 , @entity23 , @entity5 , after a weekend away			0
police launched a massive hunt for the university graduate but her body was found by dog walkers on christmas morning in a country lane in @entity328 , @entity329 - just three miles from her home			0
the net closed in on @entity279 and he was arrested on january 20 when police matched his dna to samples found on miss @entity22 's body and clothing .			0

strangulation ' is a method of killing that takes time and it is n't done in the @entity148 ' says prosecutor in closing speech
@entity346 calls on jurors not to be taken in by ' intelligent ' defendant labelling him ' dishonest , deceitful and a liar '
defence said court should reject the assertion that her death was ' planned , premeditated and sexually motivated '
