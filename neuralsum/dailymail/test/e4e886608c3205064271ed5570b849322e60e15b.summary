defeated : @entity0 lost at the @entity1 in 1815 guests attending a service in @entity4 to mark the 200th anniversary of the @entity1 have been told not to act in a ' triumphalist ' way – to avoid upsetting the @entity7			1
invitations to the service at @entity10 advise that it will avoid glorifying the @entity13 's historic victory over @entity0 in 1815			1
but last night the move was criticised by politicians , who said it ' took political correctness to an absurd new degree '			1
the invitation to the @entity21 event says : ' the service , although related to a military victory , is not in any way glorifying war , nor must it be seen as triumphalist			1
' instead , the service – to be attended by members of the @entity28 and senior political and military figures – will focus on the ' pan-european ' implications of the battle and the century of peace that followed			1
conservative @entity33 , who is bidding to be re-elected as a @entity36 mp , said : ' @entity1 was a triumph of good versus evil			1
@entity0 was responsible for between three million and 6.5 million deaths			0
' two hundred years on , it is ridiculous to spare the blushes of the @entity7 by not celebrating the battle for what it was			0
what next ? will we ask @entity7 to apologise for the @entity45 ? ' the service of commemoration , to take place on the 200th anniversary of @entity1 on june 18 , will be the centrepiece of a series of events to mark the battle			1
@entity1 200 chairman , @entity56 sir @entity54 , defended the ' no triumphalism ' theme			2
asked if it looked as though the service was designed to avoid embarrassing the @entity7 , he said : ' some people may read it like that but it 's not how we look at it			0
' he added that the enemy at @entity1 was @entity0 – not @entity7 as such			2
the commemoration was highlighting the effect of the battle on @entity72 , not the military campaign or the battle itself			0
' what @entity1 brought in was an extended period of peace in @entity72 after a particularly horrible 20 years of war , ' sir @entity76 said			2
' the commemoration looks forward to the @entity72 harmony that followed it			0
' @entity84 , author of @entity85 , a new book about @entity1 , said @entity13 would not have objected to the non-triumphalist tone			0
he added : ' the @entity13 strongly believed in the restoration of the status quo after the battle , including the restoration of the @entity93 monarchy in @entity7			0
