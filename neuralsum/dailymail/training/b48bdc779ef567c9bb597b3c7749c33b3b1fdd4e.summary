by @entity0 published : 07:17 est , 19 november 2012 updated : 09:49 est , 19 november 2012 an angry father has criticised a school after his eight - year - old son was ordered to wear a fluorescent yellow jacket as a dunce hat - style punishment for misbehaving in class			1
@entity9 was ordered to wear the high visibility jacket for three weeks after he was told off for throwing leaves at other pupils who had been bullying him			1
furious dad @entity14 , 59 , slammed staff at @entity16 in @entity17 - accusing them of making his son wear the equivalent of ' a dunce ’s cap '			2
humiliated : @entity9 ( left ) was forced to wear a fluorescent yellow jacket ( file picture right ) as a punishment for three weeks			1
his father @entity14 ( left ) said he was shocked by the punishment from @entity29 primary school @entity30 , a retired lecturer at @entity31 , said : ' it ’s like making him wear a dunce ’s cap			2
it ’s unacceptable and demeaning for my son			0
' there have been times when he does n’t want to go to school and has been pretending to be ill and it ’s because of the jacket			2
' i am shocked - this is not the way to treat an eight - year - old and i am sure it is more disruptive to have him wear this jacket			1
' he said @entity9 was made to wear the jacket after he stuffed leaves down the shirts of children who had bullied him			1
humiliated @entity9 , who is the youngest of five children , said : ' i do n’t like going to school because i have to wear the jacket			1
punishment : @entity16 and @entity60 in @entity17 make students who misbehave wear a fluorescent jacket as a punishment ' it makes me feel nervous when i wear it because i know other people are looking at me			2
' after his son came home in floods of tears after being tormented about wearing the jacket , dr @entity9 demanded the school , which caters for 470 pupils aged 3 - 11 , scrap the punishment policy			1
but headteacher @entity74 , defended the move - claiming it shames pupils into behaving			0
she said : ' we have been trialling the scheme of jackets and we have seen improvements in some children ’s behaviour			0
' they are in no way used to shame the children or to make them look as if they are doing community service			0
' when children ’s behaviour falls below standards , we are keen to see this change by rewarding children when they make the right decision			0
slammed : parents believe humiliating students is not the right form of punishment ' with the jackets , the teachers know who to give praise to and reward more			0
' but parents at the school are demanding the punishment jackets are axed			0
dad - of - three @entity105 , 40 , whose eight - year - old son attends the school , said : ' the school should be able to control pupil behaviour with words rather than shaming them			1
' this policy actually encourages pupils to bully and pick on those who are different , it ’s a backward approach which should be stopped immediately			0
