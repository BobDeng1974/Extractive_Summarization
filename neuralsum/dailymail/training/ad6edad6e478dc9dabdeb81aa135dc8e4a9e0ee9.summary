by @entity0 published : 08:07 est , 15 may 2013 updated : 08:08 est , 15 may 2013 as far as the men of @entity5 617 squadron were aware , the piece of paper pinned to the noticeboard in may 1943 was simply a list of those required for a night training run			1
but the 133 names on ' @entity11			0
' were destined to play a crucial role in the war , as they had actually been assigned to fly in the @entity16 raid			2
the battle order document - which lists the names of all the crew in 19 @entity21 bombers who were to take part in the pivotal operation to flood the industrial heartland of @entity25 - is one of only two known to exist , and is set for auction tomorrow on the 70th anniversary of the legendary attack			1
it belonged to air commodore @entity31 who , after the successful mission , put a poignant pencilled line through eight of the bombers that were lost			1
although they would not know until the last minute , the 133 names of @entity5 crewmen on ' @entity11			2
' had been assigned to fly in the @entity16 raid			2
of the 19 bombers , eight were downed , indicated by a pencil line just through the captain 's name , as was common practice			1
the three waves of attack were marked as @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49 the numbers to the right of each row show the time the planes returned to base a group picture of the @entity16 squadron			2
it was only four hours before the 19 planes took off for @entity25 's @entity58 that the crews were informed of their mission , codenamed @entity61 it was common practice to only pencil out the name of the captain to signify a downed bomber - each containing a crew of seven			1
for security reasons , only a handful of senior officers knew the details and objective of the mission until the last moment			1
so secret were the plans that the battle order pinned up on the @entity5 noticeboard that day was entitled ' @entity11 ' to make it appear to the men it was a normal training run			2
it was only four hours before the 19 planes took off for @entity25 's @entity58 that the crews were informed of their mission , codenamed @entity61			1
the first name on the sheet of paper was legendary wing commander @entity87 , who led the squadron and was told about the raid three days before			1
using the bouncing bomb invented by engineer dr @entity92 , seven @entity90 struck the @entity94 and @entity95 dams , causing catastrophic flooding and wiping out scores of armament factories			2
on his copy of the flying programme , @entity99 noted the times eight of the 11 bombers returned to @entity105 , @entity106 , with @entity87 's plane being the penultimate one at 4.15am			1
the first name on the sheet of paper was legendary wing commander @entity87 ( left ) , who led the squadron and was told about the raid three days before			1
right , an aerial reconnaissance photo taken on may 17 , 1943 showing the breach in the @entity113 in the @entity58 caused by @entity16 's raid during the previous night only one other copy of the battle order document is known to exist today and that is held at the @entity5 museum in @entity119 , @entity106 , and does not include any personal annotations on it			1
although the mission was hailed a success , 53 crew members were lost and three were taken prisoner of war			1
the document is being sold tomorrow on the 70th anniversary of the @entity16 ' raid after being put up for auction by the son of a late @entity5 flyer			1
wing commander @entity133 , 90 , flew with @entity16 after @entity61			1
he said : ' there were n't many copies of these night flying programmes printed			2
' one would have been on the officers ' ops board and another on the @entity140 ' board			0
' the men had been practising low - level night flying for several weeks before the dams raid but had no idea what or when the mission was			1
' the programme document would have been pinned up during the day but @entity148 only gave the clearance for @entity61 at 4.45pm			0
' the first @entity21 took off at 9.30pm			0
in between the two times , the men would have had briefings			0
the routes were already planned and the navigators had to plot them on their maps			0
' @entity87 led the way			1
he bombed the @entity94 dam first and then directed other aircraft circling to go in and drop their bombs			0
he then ordered the aircraft to go to the @entity95 dam and attack that			0
' the times back and the losses would have been officially recorded but clearly this was @entity167 's own personal record			0
' the 13in by 8in sheet of paper was later mounted in the the frame			0
at some point , it was donated to a museum , possible at @entity175 , @entity176 , as wording on the frame states the item had been kindly loaned by the executors of the @entity181			0
@entity182 , of @entity184 auctioneers of @entity185 , @entity186 , said : ' it is being sold by the son whose father served in the @entity5			2
sadly , he does n't know where or how his father acquired it			0
' there is one copy of this document at the @entity119 museum and this one was clearly made at the same time as it is in the same print and had identical folds , which would suggest the two documents were folded together			0
' the document has a pre-sale estimate of £ 1,500			0
the @entity204 's front page from may 19 1943 , which carried reports of the @entity16 raid under the headline : ' heart of @entity58 flooded ' the @entity5 's @entity210 , a @entity21 bomber , will perform a fly - past of a @entity214 reservoir at around 12.50pm on thursday			1
the plane , @entity216 's last operational @entity21 , will be joined by two spitfires and two @entity218 from today ’s @entity16 for three spectacular runs down the @entity220 and strafe the @entity224 - just as @entity87 and his men did so many times in those ‘ bloody dangerous ’ training runs			2
earlier on , the devoted locals who run the little dam museum will also be holding their annual memorial service			0
more than 400 veterans are also expected to gather at @entity105 in @entity106 , where the @entity16 squadron was based			0
among them will be members of @entity87 ’s family along with two veterans of the raid , and the daughter of bouncing bomb inventor @entity92			2
on friday , there will be an international service at @entity238			0
but thanks to the health - and - safety brigade , few members of the public will be able to be there , too			0
@entity244 , which owns the dam , and other public sector ‘ stakeholders ’ have decreed heavy traffic on country lanes would pose an unacceptable threat to the emergency services			0
@entity252 carried 9,000lb of bouncing bombs for the @entity61 raids on @entity25 's @entity58 dams			1

for security reasons , only handful of senior officers knew details and objective of mission until the last moment
@entity5 's 617 squadron flew 19 @entity90 at night , on may 16 , 1943 , to destroy three dams in @entity58 *valley*
