by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor inflation has risen for the first time in 10 months , dashing hopes of an early end to the squeeze on family incomes			2
travel firms bumping up plane and ferry ticket prices by a fifth for the @entity13 holidays were a major factor in the rise in the @entity16 to 1.8 per cent			1
latest figures show annual wage increases were stuck at 1.7 per cent , meaning incomes are still being outstripped by the rising cost of living			2
the rise in inflation to 1.8 per cent means prices are still rising faster than wages , which are up by 1.7 per cent today ’s figures are the first rise in @entity27 since june 2013			1
the @entity28 said : ‘ this means that a basket of goods and services that cost £ 100.00 in april 2013 would have cost £ 101.80 in april 2014			1
’ a sharp rise in transport costs was by far the largest factor for the increase in overall prices , the @entity28 said			1
‘ prices , overall , increased between march and april 2014 , compared with a fall between the same two months a year earlier			1
‘ @entity40 fares and sea fares were the two largest contributors to the rise , with prices increasing by 18 per cent and 22 per cent on the month respectively			1
‘ this compares with a fall of 6 per cent and a rise of 3 per cent for air fares and sea fares on the month a year ago			1
the timing of @entity13 was likely a factor in both cases			1
’ transport costs , especially air and sea fares , were the biggest factor in the increase in inflation labour leader @entity58 was put on the spot about his own finances @entity58 was today accused on live tv of being out of ‘ touch with reality ’ after underestimating his family 's weekly food shopping bill			1
the @entity68 leader , who has attacked the government over the cost of living , claimed he spent around £ 70 or £ 80 a week on groceries			0
but he appeared taken aback when told the average bill for a family of four is more than £ 100 , as he claimed his £ 140,000 salary meant he was ‘ relatively comfortably off ’			2
appearing on @entity80 ’s @entity79 , mr @entity58 claimed the ‘ cost - of - living crisis is the biggest issue that our country faces and i am determined we tackle it ’			1
but he was put on the spot about how much it really costs to feed a family of four			0
asked about the average weekly household grocery bill , mr @entity58 responded : ‘ it depends on how much you are spending			1
’ pressed on his own family 's bill , mr @entity58 said : ‘ we probably spend £ 70 , £ 80 a week on groceries at least , probably more than that			1
‘ the point is that different families will have different costs that they face but what i am clear about is that there is a crisis facing so many people			0
’ but tv presenter @entity100 took him to task for appearing out of touch			2
she told him : ‘ the average weekly bill for a family of four is more than £ 100			2
so you are going to be spending significantly more than £ 70 or £ 80			0
‘ people will say one of the problems with politicians is they are actually talking about something but not in touch with reality			1
’ the cost of clothes and shoes also rose between march and april , having remained flat a year ago			1
the price of food and drink fell by 0.5 per cent , with vegetables down after a better growing season this spring			0
ministers had hoped to see wages over-take inflation by now , which would have meant people felt better off each month			2
@entity126 chief secretary to the treasury @entity127 said : ‘ ' today 's figures are further evidence that our long term plan to fix the economy is working			0
‘ low inflation helps families cope with the cost of living and helps businesses plan for the future			0
‘ as a result of the @entity126 and our coalition partners taking the difficult decisions needed to stick to the economic plan we are now seeing a pattern of strengthening growth , strong job creation and stable prices			0
‘ these factors are combining to create the right climate for the increased business confidence and investment that we need to secure this hard earned recovery			0
' experts at @entity156 said the rise in inflation looked likely to be a ‘ blip ’ almost entirely reflecting the timing of @entity13			1
capital 's @entity162 economist @entity161 said the trend should continue to be down over the rest of 2014 as commodity prices stabilise , import prices fall and supermarkets and other retailers step up competition			0
he said : ‘ we continue to think that @entity27 inflation should ease to as low as 1 per cent by the end of this year and remain comfortably below the 2 per cent target in 2015			0
’ but @entity175 , of @entity176 , said there were tentative signs of wages picking up , with momentum building over the coming year and good indications of hiring intentions			2
‘ in an environment of firm economic growth and strengthening corporate pricing power we feel that @entity27 will gradually grind higher over coming quarters , ’ he said			0
the @entity187 said last week that it expected inflation to remain at or below its 2 per cent target for the next few years , easing pressure on it to hike interest rates			0
it has been helped by a 10 per cent rise in the value of sterling since last year , keeping the cost of imported goods down			2
a @entity199 spokesman said : ‘ the latest figures show that inflation remains below the target rate and well below half of the peak in september 2011			0
‘ @entity206 inflation and rising job numbers show that the government 's long - term plan is working and @entity162 is coming back			0
‘ the biggest risk to economic security would be abandoning the plan that is creating a brighter economic future			0

@entity215 rise to 1.8 **%** in april , first increase since june 2013
air and sea fares biggest factor in increase as prices rose in @entity13 holidays
wages are only up 1.7 **%** year - on - year so the income squeeze continues
@entity58 accused of being ' out of touch with reality ' on his shopping bill
