it is also turns out to be an indication that their personality is also on the spicy side			0
a new study has found that people who like stimulating their taste buds with meals such as a vindaloo curry also have risk - taking personalities			2
spicy : people who like stimulating their taste buds with meals such as a vindaloo curry also have risk - taking personalities , a report shows researchers in the @entity21 tested 200 people to see how they reacted to certain adrenalin pumping sensations , such as standing on the edge of something or watching highly suspenseful movies			1
dr. @entity27 of the @entity28 and @entity29 in @entity30 says the correlation between risk taking and spicy food makes sense they were then given a small amount of capsaicin - the active ingredient in chilli peppers - in a glass of water and and asked to swish it around their mouth			1
those who said they liked the spicy taste were the same ones who enjoyed the adrenalin rush of risky behaviour			1
the test , known as @entity53 ’s inventory of @entity54 , was carried out by researchers at @entity56 in @entity57			0
the @entity59 test is used by scientists to determine each person ’s level of risk taking behaviour			0
dr. @entity27 of the @entity28 and @entity64 and @entity29 in @entity30 says the correlation between risk taking and spicy food makes total sense to him			2
he said : ' there ’s a long - standing hypothesis that risk takers are adrenaline deficient and that they take risks to get that adrenaline and feel better			1
' so they ’ll work with bombs or in other high risk environments and then they ’ll feel normal			0
' similarly , when you eat hot spicy food , it gives you a little bit of pain and therefore enhances your adrenaline level			0

researchers in the @entity21 tested 200 people to see how they reacted to certain adrenalin pumping sensations
those who liked spicy taste were whose who enjoyed the adrenalin rush of risky behaviour
