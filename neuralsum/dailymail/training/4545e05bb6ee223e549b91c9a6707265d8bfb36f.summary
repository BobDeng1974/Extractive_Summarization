by @entity0 published : 06:51 est , 9 april 2013 updated : 01:47 est , 10 april 2013 there was speculation that @entity3 may have pulled its ambassador out of @entity5 after a removal truck was seen at its suburban west @entity8 embassy yesterday			1
boxes were loaded into a shipping container at the property in @entity12			1
an official at the property denied that it was being evacuated , saying that speculation of a withdrawal from @entity5 was ' ridiculous and not true '			2
a large container was reversed into the @entity3 embassy in west @entity8 , leading speculation that the ambassador is being pulled out of the @entity5 police held traffic so the container could be moved into position at the embassy in @entity12 but the man , who refused to give his name , would not explain why possessions were being removed from the building or say whether ambassador @entity30 was relocating			1
he said : ' i wo n't say anything about this			0
we have said everything we are going to say to the @entity36			0
' the country 's regime has a reputation for extreme secrecy , such as censoring its citizens and allowing only a small number of visitors through its borders , who are closely monitored during their stay			2
speculation that the country 's ambassador was preparing to leave the @entity5 was prompted earlier this week when a sign appeared on a tree outside the property warning that ' loading ' would take place on tuesday			1
an individual at the property previously said that a secretary was leaving the @entity5 having come to the end of his term and that a replacement secretary would arrive shortly afterwards			1
the seven - bedroom property , which has been @entity3 's embassy since 2003 , is often a focal point for demonstrations against the oppressive regime			1
built in the 1920s in a residential suburb , it is a far cry from the more luxurious ambassadorial properties of other nations in central @entity8			0
boxes were seen being brought out of the house into the waiting lorry , that had been reversed up to the door to try to shield the action from waiting cameras the move came on the day that @entity3 sent more shivers through the international community by warning foreigners living in @entity80 to flee because the region was on the verge of nuclear war			1
' the situation on the @entity85 is inching close to a thermonuclear war … @entity3 does not want to see foreigners in @entity80 fall victim to the war , ' the government mouthpiece , @entity89 news agency , said			2
' all foreign institutions and enterprises and foreigners , including tourists , are requested to take measures for shelter and evacuation in advance for their safety			0
' the latest threat came as @entity3 's anxious neighbours beefed up their defences			1
getting out ? a sign outside the @entity3 embassy suggests the ambassador could be quitting @entity8 - as there will be ' loading ' on tuesday morning quitting @entity8 ? the seven - bedroom ordinary home that is the @entity3 embassy where ambassador @entity30 lives honour : @entity30 , the @entity3 ambassador , presents his credentials to the @entity112 in a private audience at @entity114 last year @entity115 ordered @entity117 missile batteries to be deployed in the centre of @entity119 amid growing fears @entity3 may be preparing a new missile test			1
the new threat appeared to be an attempt to scare foreigners into pressing their governments to get @entity126 and @entity127 to act to avert a conflict			0
analysts see a direct attack on @entity127 as extremely unlikely and there are no overt signs that @entity3 's 1.2 million - strong army is preparing for war – let alone a nuclear one			1
@entity115 's chief cabinet spokesman said the government is ' doing all we can to protect the safety of our nation ' threats : dictator @entity142 , pictured here pointing a pistol , has repeatedly threatened to attack @entity80 and the @entity144 few embassies in @entity80 have advised their citizens to quit the country			2
the @entity144 , which has also been threatened by @entity148 , says there are no imminent signs of threats to @entity144 citizens			0
earlier yesterday , @entity3 workers failed to turn up for work at a factory complex operated with @entity80 , effectively shutting down the last major symbol of co-operation between the hostile neighbours			0
analysts say @entity148 's war rhetoric also has a domestic purpose – to bolster support for @entity142 , 30 , the third member of his family to lead the country			0
but @entity167 secretary general ban ki - moon warned that soaring tension on the @entity85 was ' very dangerous ' – and said ' any small incident caused by miscalculation or misjudgment ' might ' create an uncontrollable situation '			0
the @entity144 military commander in the @entity174 , admiral @entity175 , said @entity3 's pursuit of nuclear weapons and long - range ballistic missiles represented a ' clear and direct threat ' to the @entity144 and its allies in the region			2
admiral @entity175 said the @entity144 military and its allies would be ready if @entity3 tried to strike .			0
