parts of the @entity1 are becoming no - go areas for police because minority communities are operating their own justice systems , according to the chief inspector of constabulary			1
the rise in ‘ community justice ’ means crimes as serious as murder and sexual abuse are going unreported – a situation reminiscent of @entity13 in the height of the @entity15			1
@entity16 said police officers were simply never called to some neighbourhoods , where law - abiding people rather than criminals administer their own form of justice honour killings , genital mutilation , and domestic violence are some of the offences thought to be unreported he said : ‘ there are some communities born under other skies who will not involve the police at all			1
i am reluctant to name the communities in question , but there are communities from other cultures who would prefer to police themselves			1
‘ there are cities in the @entity43 where the police never go because they are never called			1
they never hear of any trouble because the community deals with that on its own			2
‘ it ’s not that the police are afraid to go into these areas or do n’t want to go into those areas , ’ he said			2
‘ but if the police do n’t get calls for help then , of course , they wo n’t know what ’s going on			1
’ honour killings , domestic violence , sexual abuse of children and female genital mutilations are some of the offences that are believed to be unreported in some cities			1
last december , three members of a self - styled ‘ @entity68 ’ vigilante group were jailed for harassing , intimidating and assaulting people in @entity70 while claiming they were enforcing sharia law			1
chief inspector of constabulary @entity16 warns police officers are never called to some areas in an interview with @entity76 , mr @entity16 said : ‘ it could be anything			2
[ honour killings ] are the most extreme case			1
there is no honour in it			2
’ @entity86 mp @entity85 said the rising number of unreported crimes was a damning indictment of our police			1
he told the @entity92 last night : ‘ directly elected police commissioners are an attempt to give people a direct say over the way people are policed			2
elsewhere the administering of justice often is ineffective and there is a great deal of incompetence in the system			0
‘ people do n’t feel they can count on their police			0
instead of placing blame with ethnic minorities , we should ask what it is that is wrong with the criminal justice system			0
’ although mr @entity16 did not specifically refer to any ethnic group , there have been growing concerns over the emergence of sharia courts in some @entity68 communities			0
senior police officers said they disagreed with the description given by mr @entity16 , who became chief inspector in october 2012			0
he is the first person from a non-police background to hold the post			0
but @entity124 , chief constable of @entity125 , said : ‘ i do n’t know if he ’s talking about @entity126 , but i have only had one conversation with him since he took office and it was n’t about this			0
‘ his characterisation of these communities as born under other skies is just wrong			0
many members of communities in @entity126 are @entity1 - born and i find that a very odd expression			0
’ mr @entity16 insisted that public trust in the police needed to be restored for a functioning justice system			1
he said the police ‘ are not a paramilitary force – they are citizens in uniform ’			0
a spokesman for the @entity143 said : ‘ we all rely on the police to protect our communities and this can be only done through full co-operation and partnership			0
‘ co-operation is particularly important for @entity68 communities who have experienced a rise in islamophobic hate crimes			0

rise in ' community justice ' in @entity43 cutting number of police calls
forces warn genital mutilations and honour killings are being kept *hidden*
follows *conviction* of @entity165 last year for ' enforcing sharia law '
