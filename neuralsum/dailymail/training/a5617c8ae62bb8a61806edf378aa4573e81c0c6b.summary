one can almost hear the buzzing of the neon lights and the flickering of a strobe as they as they provide a beacon for some @entity36 to grab a bottle of beer , stay the night or do their laundry			0
and even though many of the stores are closed , the luminous , energetic colors remind us all that here is a city bursting full of life			0
glowing : at this liquor store , you 're spoilt for lighting ... if not for choice ! the photographer @entity69 calls her series ' expired @entity4 : an ongoing series of exploration of @entity4 at night ' ms. @entity69 says she looks for run down buildings that hold a forgotten beauty and photographs them with expired , 35 - year - old film			2

lost in translation : at this @entity4 laundry , even @entity91 script does not escape the clutches of the neon press ... @entity95 : impress your friends with a stay at the ' @entity99 ' where color tv with questionable entertainment is still a feature ! @entity104 red : life can be lived at this @entity107 liquor store with lottery , money orders , groceries and beer amongst the items that can be picked up now showing : bold and bright , drinkers would not have a hard time finding a pick - me - up near this store open all hours : no signs of life outside this sinister looking ' theater ' in the neighborhood : renters would find themselves stumbling to and from this charming and conveniently located cocktail bar in the early hours signing off : it looks like the only thing that was n't delivered was the ' q ' in this sign lights off : maintenance standards at the @entity130 reached such depths , they rebranded to ' lace ' ! vacancy : a cosy night with so few guests , you 'd know them all by dinner an @entity4 original ? it seems the connecting orbits motif has been around longer than anyone realised lighting up : there is a warming constancy to the shop level lightning get the message : how many open signs does one shop need ?			1
