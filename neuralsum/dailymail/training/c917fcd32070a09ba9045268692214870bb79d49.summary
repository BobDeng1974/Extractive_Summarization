@entity1 manager @entity0 has dismissed speculation linking him with a move for @entity5 forward @entity4			1
the 19 - year - old , who has risen to prominence for both the @entity8 and @entity9 in the last 12 months , is yet to agree a new deal at @entity11 and there have been suggestions that @entity1 were keen to lure him to @entity15			1
but former @entity16 boss @entity0 pointed out that they already have plenty to choose from in attacking areas so he sees no reason to sign @entity4 , despite acknowledging his undoubted pedigree			1
@entity4 , still only 19 , has become a central figure for both @entity5 and @entity9 this season ' @entity4 is a player of great quality , certainly one of the best in @entity25 , ' he told @entity26 ' but we already have extraordinary talent here			2
' given @entity29 notched his 15th league goal in seven games as @entity1 romped to a 5 - 0 win over @entity33 on saturday it is easy to see why improvements in that area may not be a priority for @entity0 - especially when he also has the likes of @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 and highly - rated youngster @entity42			2
' to think of another striker for the @entity1 attack is really extremely difficult , ' he added			0
' it 's clear that @entity4 is not in our plans			2
' @entity1 boss @entity0 said that , although @entity4 is a great player , they have no plans to sign him the 55 - year - old @entity51 is set to get a much closer look at @entity4 when his side travel to @entity54 to face @entity5 in the @entity55 on wednesday			1
@entity0 has insisted that he will make no special plans to deal with the threat posed by @entity4 because he instead prefers to focus on the danger posed by teams as a unit			2
but one player in the @entity5 ranks who may capture @entity0 's imagination is @entity65 after the @entity51 admitted he dreamt of pairing the former @entity9 captain with @entity68 during his time at the @entity70			1
@entity0 said that with the attacking talent @entity1 already have , it 's difficult to imagine signing another forward @entity0 , who won the @entity55 twice during his eight - year spell at @entity70 from 2001 to 2009 , revealed that he made failed overtures to sign the 34 - year - old			1
he said : ' we had sounded him out but @entity65 's bond with @entity5 was unbreakable			0
' i do n't remember exactly what year it was but we did try			0
of course , i wanted to pair him up with @entity68 , it was a fantastic combination			0
putting @entity65 in midfield with @entity68			0
it would have been fantastic			0
' @entity0 also revealed he tried to sign @entity65 for @entity70 so he could pair him with @entity68			0

@entity0 said he is not *interested* in signing @entity4
but the former @entity16 boss did *praise* @entity4 's ability
@entity0 said @entity1 already have plenty of attacking *options*
@entity5 and @entity1 are in the same @entity55 group
the two sides will face each other at @entity11 on wednesday
