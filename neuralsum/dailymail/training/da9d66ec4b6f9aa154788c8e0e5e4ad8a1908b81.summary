by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 09:15 est , 8 march 2013 updated : 09:19 est , 8 march 2013 @entity3 leader @entity2 enjoyed dinner with media boss @entity5 this week , in a fresh sign of the anti-eu ’s emergence as a significant political force			1
the @entity10 @entity3 is riding high after coming second in the @entity11 by - election , pushing the @entity13 into a humiliating third place			1
news that mr @entity5 has hosted mr @entity2 for dinner – thought to be the first of its kind – will be seen as a fresh blow for @entity21 ’s conservatives , who had previously relied on the support of the @entity5 empire			2
write caption here the two men dined at mr @entity5 ’s @entity28 flat on tuesday night			1
they discussed the possibility of a @entity3 pact with the @entity13 , but only if mr @entity21 was ousted as leader			1
@entity3 is growing increasingly confident of winning the elections to the @entity34 next year , and mr @entity2 told mr @entity5 he could win half of all the seats up for grabs , the @entity32 reported			1
last night mr @entity5 claimed mr @entity2 was ‘ reflecting opinion ’ and suggested new leaders are ‘ emerging on distant horizon ’			0
in a new opinion poll , carried out by former @entity42 donor @entity41 , 12 per cent of people said theyb would vote for @entity3 in a general election , compared to nine per cent for the @entity46			2
while @entity3 has traditionally been seen as a threat mainly to the @entity13 , appealing to party traditionalists on issues like @entity50 and immigration			1
mr @entity2 's success has spooked the @entity13 , but @entity46 president @entity53 has warned the @entity20 not to trumpet policies which appeal to ' the man in the pub ' but a separate survey carried out in the wake of the @entity11 by - election suggested that much of the @entity3 support came from voters from all the major parties , keen to deliver a stinging rebuke to the @entity65 elite			1
it revealed that 22 per cent of 2010 voting @entity13 switched to @entity3 , along with 19 per cent of @entity46			1
@entity21 tried to move on from the @entity11 result with a major speech on the economy in @entity70 , @entity71 another poll this week suggested that 38 per cent of people would now ‘ consider ’ voting for @entity3			1
mr @entity5 took to @entity74 last night with political observations about his @entity50 visits this week - drawing parallels between the @entity10 and @entity78			2
‘ politics both places very fluid , economies going nowhere			0
new leaders emerging on distant horizon , ’ he wrote in one post			0
‘ @entity84 wracked by discontent and resentment of @entity87			0
glad we contributed to @entity10 resisting the @entity89 over many years , ‘ @entity90 , @entity91 , few excellent , frustrated ministers			0
’ meanwhile , @entity46 president @entity53 has warned the @entity13 against trying to woo @entity3 supporters with populist policies			2
mr @entity53 told @entity96 : ‘ what @entity21 has not understood , what @entity98 got so wrong , is that saying things that the man in the pub tends to chime with does n’t win you an election			0
‘ because those people when they ’ve sobered up realise it sounds ridiculous			0
the other thing is @entity3 prove that their vote is not just about @entity50 at all			0
‘ it ’s a general discontented , broadly right wing but not exclusively , protest vote			0
so @entity21 is fighting the wrong issues			0
