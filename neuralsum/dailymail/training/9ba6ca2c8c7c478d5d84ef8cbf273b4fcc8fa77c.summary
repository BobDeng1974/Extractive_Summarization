by @entity0 published : 11:08 est , 21 june 2012 updated : 11:08 est , 21 june 2012 the family of a cancer - stricken little girl pleaded for help today after they faced the dawning reality that she could die stranded in @entity7			1
@entity8 flew to the city of @entity10 earlier this month to undergo specialist treatment , but unlike others , the bed - ridden seven - year - old has not responded successfully			1
she is unlikely to survive now that the cancer has spread to her lungs and brain , but doctors have refused permission for her to fly home to @entity20 , @entity21 , without medical support			1
and the family are now battling to raise the £ 140,000 they need to fly her back home in a special private jet			1
sick : @entity8 has not responded well to treatment and her family need £ 140,000 to fly her home because of her worsening condition , @entity8 requires specialist equipment to keep her alive and only a private jet has the space and facilities to cater for her needs			1
with the charter from @entity10 to @entity38 costing £ 137,196 , plus another £ 1,643 to fly a medic overseas , the family are desperate to find ways to raise the cash			1
speaking from @entity10 , @entity8 ’s mother @entity42 said : ' we want her to be surrounded by friends and family that love her , not strangers			1
' she was in quite a bad condition when we came but now she ’s critical			1
the charity that we ’re involved with is already having to fork out money that we do n’t have			2
' any support we can get to help her back home would be a massive help			1
i am hoping for a miracle where we can take her home and have her for a little while			1
support : @entity8 with father @entity60 receiving treatment			1
her family want to leave @entity7 and be at home ' my best case scenario is to get home , so that if she was going to die she could be surrounded by her family and friends			1
' tragic : @entity8 before she was first diagnosed with cancer in 2009			2
her family have previously flown her to @entity68 for treatment @entity8 was diagnosed with stage four @entity71 three years ago and the family have previously flown to @entity68 so she can receive immunotherapy			1
earlier this month she flew out to the @entity74 in @entity7 to try photodynamic therapy			2
but , @entity8 , who is big sister to @entity76 , 22 months , has been one of the few patients not to respond to a special injection to make the tumours easier to break down			1
@entity42 said : ' she had the injection			2
we knew it would make her worse and then make her better			2
' it ’s made her worse , but she never seemed to get better			2
all the other people who have had the injection have been getting better after two or three days			2
' now she ca n’t even hear me			2
i was trying to tell her that i love her , but she could n’t			2
' i was holding her hand and telling her to squeeze if she could hear me , but she did n’t even move			0
' i am hoping for a miracle			0
i want her at home , surrounded by people that love her			1
' @entity42 , who is 25 weeks pregnant , also fears @entity8 might not live long enough to see her sibling			0
she said : ' it ’s always in the back of my mind that we might have a chance of losing @entity8 before i have this baby			0
' it makes me cry			0
it makes me think why is she like this and so unwell			0
@entity8 is just in absolute agony - but does n’t ever complain			0
she ’s always putting everyone else first			0
@entity8 before she was first diagnosed with cancer in 2009 with her mother @entity42 who is pregnant ' before she took a turn for the worst i would lay in bed with her , because i help rub her tumours , which helps with the pain			0
' she said ‘ mum you ’re pregnant and you have a sore back , you should n’t be doing this ’			0
' i said ‘ @entity8 , pregnancy is normal - cancer is not ’			0
@entity42 even had an ultrasound to determine the sex of the baby at @entity8 ’s special request			0
she said : ' she got her dad to wheel her through in absolute agony and we found out it was a boy , which is what she wanted			0
' @entity8 , pictured with her parents before the cancer struck , is now being monitored round the clock doctors , who have transferred @entity8 to a high dependency ward , are now monitoring her around the clock			1
and @entity42 and her husband @entity60 take shifts spending time with @entity8 while the other watches @entity76			0
hospital rules restrict them from staying in @entity8 ’s room overnight			0
instead @entity42 and @entity60 take turns sleeping outside her door on the floor			0
@entity42 ’s close friend @entity140 appeal to @entity142 residents to donate money to helk fly the family back to @entity20			1
she said : ' they ’ve been through so much			0
we have got to get them home			1
it ’s @entity149 phoned it was the worst call ever			0
' anyone interested in donating can visit www.justgiving.com/olivia-downie-appeal			0

doctors refuse to let her fly home to @entity21 without medical support
family must *pay* for a private jet big enough for the specialist equipment
