by @entity0 a powerful new film has highlighted the increase in homophobic attacks in @entity4 ahead of the @entity5 following the passing of an anti-gay ‘ propaganda ’ law			1
the film , ‘ @entity14 and gay in @entity16 ’ , from a @entity11 film released in partnership with @entity13 , found that homophobia was ingrained in everyday people in the street , with one even comparing homosexuality to zoophilia			2
in june , president @entity22 signed into law a bill punishing people for homosexual ‘ propaganda ’			1
part of his activism is to teach gay teenagers about how to protect themselves online from the likes of violent vigilante groups @entity50 , a taxi driver for the gay taxi service in @entity39 ' @entity52 '			1
unlike the activists he is cautious about being open with his sexual orientation			0
the law imposed fines on those who disseminate information aimed at minors ‘ directed and forming non-traditional sexual setup ’ , or which may cause a ‘ distorted understanding ’ that gay and heterosexual relationships are equal			2
activists and celebrities have repeatedly called on mr @entity22 to repeal the law but to no avail , while there have been calls to boycott @entity5			1
only on friday , mr @entity22 said that gay people would be welcome at the @entity72 , but in a sign of the persecution the homosexual community is under in the country , he said : ' they must leave children in peace '			1
last week , the powerful @entity79 – of which approximately 64 per cent of @entity4 identify themselves as – demanded one step further , calling for a national referendum on criminalising homosexual relationships altogether , a return to a @entity85 law enacted by @entity86			2
@entity87 and @entity88 , two of @entity4 's core @entity44 activists an @entity44 activist is unlawfully arrested after a one - man picket at an @entity37 boycott protest , outside the @entity5 headquarters in @entity39 @entity87 , @entity88 and other @entity44 activist staging an action in moscow in july 2013 to draw attention to the rise in suicides among gay teenagers since the anti-gay propaganda law was passed ‘ the one reason the law was installed in the first place was to please the @entity79 majority , ’ explained @entity102 , a @entity103 - based journalist originally from @entity104			1
‘ he [ @entity22 ] is looking for enemies			2
in @entity4 , homosexuals and gay rights activists are labelled as foreign agents			0
‘ you have such a vast majority of people who are @entity79 who potentially feel this way , those are his voters , that he is not going to step back and say “ actually gay people are ok ”			1
' the video highlights the abuse that homosexuals receive in the streets , with activists regularly attacked			0
they have gone to extraordinary lengths to protect themselves from persecution – from both official channels and @entity129 vigilante groups			0
the gay community has their own taxi service , while there are @entity44 self - defense classes			1
there are also videos on @entity42 held by activists , such as @entity137 , who has teaches gay people how to protect themselves from such groups			1
ms @entity139 , who filmed the documentary along with @entity141 , told @entity142 that she was particularly struck by the attitudes and reaction of everyday people in the street			0
‘ what i was particularly struck by was talking to a random person on the street , who in a very calm voice says they ca n’t be like @entity152 , “ we have our own traditional conservative values , and at the moment in @entity152 , they ’re legalising paedophilia , they ’re legalising zoophilia , they have zoo brothels ” , and this guy just looked like a regular professional on the street			0
there has been a rise in vigilante groups , like the @entity164 , that hunt down homosexuals online and make @entity42 clips of how they abuse them			0
here , two members of the group are humiliating a young @entity173 man @entity4 's @entity22 meets with volunteers taking part in the preparations for @entity5			2
on friday , he said gays should feel welcome at @entity5 , but must ' leave the children in peace ' ‘ the other thing when i felt the hatred the most , was when one of the activists @entity184 passed away , and we had a funeral and a memorial , so the gay rights activists we had been following joined , and the plan ( spread via social media ) was to hold a minutes silence for @entity184			1
‘ so of course , violent homophobes and various neo-nazi groups and orthodox thugs showed up because they heard about it			2
i did n’t expect this because somebody passing away is a sad moment			0
' it ’s not the place you expect people showing up to basically try and beat these people up			0
luckily there was a heavy police presence			0
‘ so many violent people trying to pick fights and getting dragged away , and you could tell they were looking at me to see what side i was on , so much hatred			0

law passed in june punishes people for homosexual ' propaganda '
@entity22 said gay people welcome at @entity5 but must ' leave children alone '
neo-nazi groups and @entity79 ' thugs ' *intimidate* gay community
persecuted gay people have their own defense groups and taxi service
