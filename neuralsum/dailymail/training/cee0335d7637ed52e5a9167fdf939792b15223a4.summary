former @entity1 star @entity0 says @entity3 fans are failing to offer their team the necessary support on big @entity7 nights			1
@entity0 , who won the @entity8 twice with @entity1 , said that atmospheres like @entity10 and @entity11 fire their teams up on @entity7 nights			2
but @entity3 's @entity14 does n't have the same impact , according to the @entity17 midfielder			2
@entity0 was critical of @entity3 fans leaving the stadium almost empty at 7.15 on tuesday the former @entity1 star said he thought @entity3 fans did n't realise how much the competition means ‘ the crowd need to get behind this team they need to create a special @entity7 atmosphere , ' @entity0 told @entity26 ahead of @entity3 's home game with @entity28 , which was watched by 37,509 fans , nearly 10,000 down on capacity			1
‘ i was lucky enough to play at @entity10 and we always talked about the atmosphere on a tuesday night , the special atmosphere you create , and the crowd is rocking when you go out for a warm up			0
‘ at quarter past seven and there 's empty seats everywhere			0
@entity0 played in the @entity8 throughout his @entity1 career and enjoyed the ' special ' occassions ‘ when you come here it just does n't have a @entity7 night feel to it			1
you go to @entity46 , you go to @entity10 , you go to @entity47 , they have a special feeling for it			0
' @entity0 also suggested that the @entity3 fans do n't appreciate how fortunate they are to be facing @entity51 's elite clubs			1
‘ tonight i do n't think there is [ a special atmosphere ]			0
i do n't think they realise what a big game this is			0
‘ they 've got the team , they 've definitely got the players , the quality is definitely there , but do the crowd realise how lucky they are to be in this competition ? i do n't think they do			0
’ another @entity1 legend @entity66 also hit out at @entity3 's fans			2
the former @entity69 captain tweeted : ' how many empty seats are there at the @entity3 vs @entity28 game by the way ... big cl game & fans would rather @entity76 or something at home '			1
the @entity80 defender continued ' expanding the stadium for what though ? ? for who though ? ? ' like @entity85 's facebook page			0
the fans did get behind their team after @entity3 took the lead after three minutes through @entity89 the @entity69 and @entity1 star won the competition twice and puts much of his success down to the fans video plenty of points still to play for - @entity97			1
