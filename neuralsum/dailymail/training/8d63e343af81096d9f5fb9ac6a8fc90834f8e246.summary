by @entity1 reporter @entity2 is learning that people really like their sliced cake loaves			1
the @entity6 - based coffee company says it will start bringing back its cake slices in response to customer feedback			1
the company had been getting rid of the slices that came in banana , iced lemon and pumpkin flavors as part of a staggered rollout of its pricier new baked goods			1
in their place , @entity2 offered what looked like miniature loaves that cost $ 2.45 , an increase of 20 cents			2
not so great : some regulars of the coffee chain complained after many stores got rid of the sliced cake loaves in favor of upscale @entity28 pastries , but a spokeswoman for @entity2 said the treats will be reintroduced in coming weeks bring it back : the @entity6 - based company had previously rid their stores of the pumpkin , iced lemon and banana loaves for pricier pastries under the @entity28 label @entity39 , a @entity2 spokeswoman , said the company realized that ' people really like the familiar , sliced cake			1
' she noted that the cake slices will still be made with new recipes and carry the higher prices			1
without providing details , she said the slices will return ' in coming weeks			2
' the new baked goods , which are warmed up in the @entity2 ovens , have so far been rolled out to roughly half of the company 's 11,500 @entity52 locations			1
that means about half of stores never got rid of the cake slices			1
going stale : @entity2 has made significant effort to improve upon its criticized line of less - than - stellar baked goods in the last few years , in part by buying up @entity28 , a @entity63 - based bakery , in 2012 strategy : getting the menu right is critical to @entity67 ¿ @entity52 growth strategy			1
in a saturated coffee market , the company is trying to entice more customers to add a pastry or croissant to their latte orders @entity2 , which has long been criticized for its underwhelming baked goods , has been trying to boost sales by convincing more people to get a bite to eat with their drinks			1
in 2012 , the company bought a small bakery chain called @entity28 that it said would start producing its baked goods with better ingredients			1
among the new items that have been hitting some stores are savory croissant squares and the sweet loaves that look like rectangular cakes , instead of the slices previously offered			2
one reason the new shape of the cake loaves is n't going over well may that they do n't look as big			0
' the look a lot smaller , and they 're priced higher , ' said @entity96 , a barista at a @entity2 cafe in @entity99 , @entity100 , who said the new baked goods are doing ' terribly ' relative to the previous baked goods			0
@entity96 noted that the biggest sellers tend to be breakfast sandwiches or other foods that make people feel full , rather than the smaller ' status consumption foods ' @entity2 seems to be pushing			0
not just coffee : selling more food is part of a strategy to expand beyond coffee into everything from tea to alcohol			0
@entity2 is adding beer and wine , along with appetizers , to thousands of locations in the @entity52 she said some of the new offerings , like the croissant squares , came across as ' too fancy			0
' another item that customers seem to miss is the reduced fat cinnamon swirl coffee cake , @entity96 said , noting that the company did n't introduce a replacement for the offering in the revamp			2
' when we launched ( the new baked goods ) , they held a big meeting and told us how awesome it was going to be			0
we ended up having to throw away tons of it , ' she said			0
@entity2 maintains that the new baked goods are being well - received overall			2
in january , chief operating officer @entity140 said that croissant sales had doubled in stores where the new recipes were introduced			0
but it 's not clear if the spike was the result of people giving new items a try			0
but @entity140 also conceded that the rollout is ' complex , ' particularly since the new baked goods have to be warmed up			0
the danger is that the extra step could slow down operations , which in turn could drive away impatient customers , particularly during the busy mornings .			0
