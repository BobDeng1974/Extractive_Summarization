by @entity0 published : 16:20 est , 3 may 2012 updated : 17:42 est , 3 may 2012 police have begun removing the last anti-war protest tent outside the houses of @entity4			2
the move came after the @entity6 lifted an injunction leaving @entity8 free to clear the tent from @entity10			0
the injunction had been in place while veteran peace campaigner @entity12 challenged the legality of new bylaws giving the council power to remove tents and sleeping equipment from the road and pavement around the square			1
removal : police officers removing the last of the anti-war protest tents outside the @entity23 ms @entity12 , 53 , has been conducting an authorised 24 - hour vigil on the east pavement of @entity10 since 2006 and obtained her injunction against the council preventing it from enforcing the bylaws			1
she co-operated with police officers as they moved her tent into a removal vehicle , even helping them to lift it			0
she said : ' this is not the end			0
we are going to go to the @entity36			1
if we lose at the @entity36 we are going to go to @entity37			1
' however , she added : ' in a way this is a liberation for me			0
it is a big responsibility for me to have this in @entity10			0
last chapter : the last anti-war protest tent in @entity10 is loaded onto a van by the police removed : a large box which was the focal point of ms @entity12 's site could be auctioned off to raise money for an @entity52 orphanage ' of course it is also a very profound statement , that is why i wanted to make the signs so large			1
it has had a big impact , bigger than i could ever have imagined			0
' my site has been photographed every day			2
' ms @entity12 has been offered assistance by @entity8 to find temporary housing			1
@entity8 leader @entity63 said : ' we have worked hard to find a solution to this problem without prohibiting the rights for free speech and protests			0
however , for some time what is a public open space has been dominated by tents and encampments which have restricted its use			0
protest : @entity12 standing outside her @entity10 protest box in may this year ' the @entity6 also took this view after a full and fair hearing			1
it concluded the protesters did not have the right to inhabit a public square designed for everyone to use			2
' throughout this process we have sought to find a solution by talking to the protesters involved			0
' people will always be allowed to protest in @entity10 - what is not reasonable is setting up permanent camps there			2
' the case arose after the @entity91 and @entity90 came into force which authorised the local council and police to remove sleeping facilities , including tents			0
last hurrah : ms @entity12 co-operated with police officers even helping them to lift her protest tent from @entity10 they can also remove equipment used for noisy protests			1
many have regarded protest tents in the square as an eyesore before the @entity107 and @entity108			2
lifting the injunction preventing the removal of ms @entity12 's tent , high court judge sir @entity109 said the new bylaws were not interfering with ms @entity12 's democratic right of protest - a right the courts ' jealously guard '			1
he said : ' the right to protest is not affected save to a very , very limited extent that the claimant can not have a tent or other similar facility in @entity10			0
' police officers said that once removed , the large box which is the focal point of ms @entity12 's site will be kept for 28 days , unless it is claimed , before it can be destroyed			1
ms @entity12 said that she intends to claim the box and auction it to raise money for an orphanage in @entity52			1
protest : officers searching tents in 2010 when the anti-war camp in @entity10 was far larger			0

peace campaigner @entity12 has been holding a 24 - hour vigil in the square since 2006
despite *apparent* *defeat* she *pledges* to go to the @entity36 and @entity37 if necessary
a large box which was the focal point of ms @entity12 's site could be auctioned off to benefit an @entity52 orphanage
