' with everyone from @entity76 to @entity83 drinking green smoothies recently , you ’d be forgiven for thinking this is just another beauty fad			2
' we all know that we ’re probably not eating enough greens , yet our greens contain the most vitamins and minerals of any foods we eat , and are the most important category of foods to consume on a daily basis to help keep us healthy			2
' @entity165 can be high in vitamin @entity166 , which can help reduce tiredness , and magnesium , which is found in dark green vegetables and can act as nature ’s tranquiliser , helping to keep us de-stressed and relaxed – so it ’s no wonder so many busy celebs are trying it !

' @entity256 smoothies containing the ingredients seen in @entity76 and @entity3 ’s can be high in vitamin @entity166 , which can help reduce tiredness			0
' the spinach in @entity76 ’s signature smoothie is high in magnesium , which is found in dark green vegetables and can act as nature ’s tranquiliser , helping to keep us de-stressed and relaxed – so it ’s no wonder so many busy celebs are trying it ! ' you ’ll notice that a lot of models are now adding green supplements to their juices , to up their nutrient intake even further			0
for instance , a daily serving of the @entity183 wholefood @entity184 contains iron content equivalent to nine cups of spinach ( 270g ) and the same @entity166 content as a 32oz steak – vitamin d in particular is important for winter , as this nutrient is produced by natural sunlight , and long cold winters can cause @entity131 to become deficient , meaning it ’s important to top up where possible			0
