emoticons such as smiley and sad faces are changing the way our brain works , @entity1 researchers have claimed			1
they say the use of the punctuation faces trigger parts of the brain usually reserved for looking at real faces			1
they believe this may be the key to their popularity - as we process them as a real face			2
researchers found that our brains adapt so that we process emoticons as if they were a real face : p i am sticking out my tongue : ^ p i am sticking out tongue , and i have a nose @entity26 i am sticking out tongue , and i have sunglasses : { i am having a hard time ;-) winking at you : - d i am laughing happily @ } - > -- rose for you ( to show affection ) ^ o i am snoring > :-( i am annoyed ' emoticons are a new form of language that we 're producing , " dr @entity35 of the school of psychology at @entity39 in @entity40 told @entity41			1
' and to decode that language we 've produced a new pattern of brain activity			1
' the researchers say that we pay more attention to faces than most other things we see as we try to ' read ' them for emotion			2
the team wanted to see if this was the case with emoticons			1
the team showed 20 participants images of real faces , smiley face emoticons ( involving the use of a colon , hyphen and parenthesis ) , and a meaningless string of characters			1
they used electrophysiology to determine the pattern of electrical activity in the brain when the participants viewed the different images , and found we react to emoticons ion the same way			1
emoticons have become massively popular , being used in text message and online conversations , along with art projects such as this @entity80 the researchers admit the were stunned by the results			1
' there is no innate neural response to emoticons that babies are born with			2
' before 1982 there would be no reason that ' :-) ' would activate face sensitive areas of the cortex but now it does because we 've learnt that this represents a face , " said @entity87			2
' this is an entirely culturally - created neural response			0
it 's really quite amazing			0
' one of the earliest appearances of the emoticon appears in an 1862 transcript of a speech by president @entity103			0
the transcript records the audience 's response to @entity103 's droll introduction as " ( applause and laughter ; )			0
" however , the modern usage began when a joke about a fake mercury spill at @entity113 was posted online and mistake for a genuine warning			0
following a debate , on sept. 19 , 1982 , faculty member @entity116 entered the debate with the following message : i propose that [ sic ] the following character sequence for joke markers : :-) read it sideways			0
actually , it is probably more economical to mark things that are not jokes , given current trends			0
for this , use : :-( seperately the yellow smiley face symbol pre-dates and was developed independent ; y , although the two have now merged in many people ' ; s minds			0
a freelance artist called @entity133 designed the original yellow smiley face to be used on a button to try and boost morale at a recently merged insurance company			0
he made $ 45 for his design , which was eventually adopted by hippy , then rave culture where is appeared n clothing and ectasy tablets .			2

emoticons first appeared in the 1980 , and have become *hugely* popular
@entity1 *experts* sat they are changing our brain activity as we adapt to decode them
