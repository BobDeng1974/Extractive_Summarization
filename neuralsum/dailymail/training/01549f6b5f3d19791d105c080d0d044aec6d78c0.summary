there can be no relaxing into paternity leave for @entity2 , not when trying to fend off the remarkable charge of @entity4 back towards the world no 1 ranking			1
@entity2 has left wife @entity7 and new - born son @entity8 behind to defend the @entity9 this week , knowing that @entity4 is close to striking a blow for the supposed tennis geriatrics by joining fellow 33 - year - old @entity12 at the summit of the season - end rankings			2
if the @entity16 wins this last significant @entity18 event of the year and @entity2 fails to make the final then the @entity15 will effectively hand over the position next monday			2
@entity15 @entity2 , during practice ahead of the @entity9 , is defending his title this week the world no 1 , with @entity24 , faces a challenge to stay at the top of the rankings from @entity4 @entity4 , holding the @entity29 title on sunday , could replace @entity2 at the top of the rankings next month even if @entity4 fails to reach the summit here he can still topple @entity2 if he significantly outperforms him at the @entity31 in @entity32			1
all this is happening slightly over the head of @entity35 , despite his recent surge of form , and he plays his first match in the @entity40 capital tomorrow — against either @entity41 or @entity43 ’s @entity42 — after winning the @entity45 final			1
@entity4 has not won a major since @entity47 and few would have expected him to rebound from a difficult 2013 with a season of such consistency			2
he has won two masters - level events , three regular @entity18 tournaments and reached five finals , including @entity53			0
@entity2 , practising groundstrokes in @entity55 , returns to the tour after the birth of his first child last week @entity35 , celebrating winning the @entity45 , is set to qualify for the @entity31 @entity35 can seal qualification for the @entity31 by reaching the quarter - finals of this week 's @entity9			1
even if he was to lose his opening match , all of the following would have to happen for him to miss out on the season - ending finale in @entity32 : whether he reaches the top spot will depend partly on how much energy he has , and on whether @entity2 manages to finish the season strongly			0
despite his new arrival he insists he is well prepared ahead of tonight ’s match with @entity70			0
@entity2 , who was gloriously outplayed in the @entity72 semi-final by @entity4 earlier this month , is not close to his rival but praised his evergreen qualities : ‘ i have a lot of respect for what he does , he ’s playing some of his best ever tennis this season , ’ said the 27 - year - old			0
‘ last year was his worst in 10 years but i never signed him out			0
he ’s coming close behind in the rankings and i ’m sure he ’s going to be very motivated , it ’s pretty much open			0
’ @entity2 and wife @entity82 become parents for the first time last week , calling their son @entity8 @entity87 , celebrating his @entity29 title , has been in fine form this season after a difficult 2013 campaign			1

*reigning* @entity9 champion defends his title after the birth of his son

the @entity16 , now 12 matches *undefeated* , won the @entity29 title on sunday
