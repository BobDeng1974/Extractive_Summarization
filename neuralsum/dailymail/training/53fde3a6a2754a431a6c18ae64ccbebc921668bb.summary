@entity1 was last seen on october 6 when she visited her *granddaughters* close to her home in @entity13 , @entity14
when she failed to go to work the next day , her daughter went to her house and found her purse still on the kitchen counter and the doors locked
the only thing that was missing was an opener for the garage
authorities say they *suspect* foul play but they do not have enough evidence to say a crime occurred
she was the owner of a *successful* truck company so they are looking into her *customers* , employees and competing companies , cops said
