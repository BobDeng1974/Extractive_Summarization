' @entity30 commissioner @entity113 said today : ' what we have seen in this investigation and others we have done into the way @entity24 deal with victims of domestic abuse is that there is sometimes a disconnect between the policies and practice of the force and what is actually happening on the front line			0
' there is a need to tackle a culture on the front line , which appears to minimise and dismiss the impact of domestic violence , to make sure that we do not see further examples where victims are let down with catastrophic outcomes			0
' there were opportunities for officers to take more robust action in this case and those opportunities were missed			0
' we are concerned that this is one of a number of @entity24 cases we are investigating , and hope that the force and its officers are learning from our and @entity151 's recommendations so that the service it provides improves			0
