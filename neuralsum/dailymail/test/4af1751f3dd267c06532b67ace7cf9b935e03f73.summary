activated charcoal is thought to act as a ' detox ' are you the first to jump on the latest food fad bandwagon ? do you regularly ' detox ' with a green tea or a wheatgrass juice ? or pack your diet full of flax seeds and acai berry - all in the hope of improving your cholesterol , preventing cancer and promoting weight loss ? every day across the world scientists publish countless studies into the health benefits of various foods			1
for example , acai berries have been linked to weight loss and cancer prevention , flax seeds are thought to help lower blood pressure and reduce the risk of heart disease , while coconut oil has been hailed as a weight loss aid			1
more recently charcoal , freekah , spiralizing and bone broth have emerged as the latest craze in healthy eating			1
each comes with its own promise , with claims of ' melting away fat cells ' , ' supercharging the metabolism ' , and ' regenerating and revitalising '			1
but what is the truth ? i am often asked in clinic about fad diets and products by patients , desperate to find a quick way to shift the pounds			1
some of these fads are clearly bonkers , with no scientific evidence to back them up			1
others have some basis in common - sense and may be worth including in the healthy , balanced , real - food appproach to eating that is the only way to succeed in the long term			1
i asked @entity57 , our @entity58 dietitian , to pick the ' miracle ' foods from the fads ... @entity63 due to its use by medical professionals in the effective treatment of toxic poisoning , some believe that taking active charcoal , often in the form of a capsule can ‘ detox ’ the body			1
however it ’s not as easy as that ; the charcoal will only remove certain poisons and only if they have recently been ingested and are therefore not yet absorbed			1
is it worth trying ? no. firstly , ‘ detoxing ’ is a word my colleagues and i do n’t agree with			1
we should be aiming for an everything in moderation approach rather than a ‘ binge - detox ’ cycle			1
secondly , activated charcoal has only been shown to be effective for acute poisoning such as certain drug - overdoses , not an accumulation of toxins over time			1
and what are these accumulated ‘ toxins ’ ? calories ? fat ? carbohydrates ? as far as we ’re concerned , all of these contribute to a healthy balanced diet - just do n’t overdo them			1
the spiraliser gadget turns various vegetables into spaghetti , helping to boost weight loss @entity103 this new gadget is getting everyone in a spin			1
take vegetables such as courgettes and carrots and turn them into low - carbohydrate ' spaghetti ' in just a few seconds			1
great to up your veg intake , increase your fibre intake and reduce your calorie intake , but is it really a healthy addition to the kitchen ? is it a healthy craze ? well , yes and no. we should all be aiming to get as much veg into our diet as possible as it provides us with a low calorie source of fibre , vitamins and minerals			1
but be careful not to use the spiraliser vegetables as a replacement for complex starchy carbohydrates like pasta , which are required for energy and other important nutrients			2
if you ’re topping your spaghetti dish with spiralised veg or they ’re accompanying a meat and potato dish then go for it , have as much as you like			1
but using the spiraliser to replace carbohydrates in your diet can lead to tiredness , fluctuating weight patterns and poor concentration			1
@entity146 @entity147 is so last year … this new grain on the block is what everyone ’s talking about now			2
@entity146 is a young green wheat which is roasted to remove the husks , giving a smoky , nutty flavour which is popular in the @entity155			2
should i give it a go ? yes			2
it ’s easy to cook and can be added to salads , soups and rice dishes easily and deliciously			2
it ’s a low glycaemic index type of carbohydrate with four times the fibre count of quinoa , so will help to keep you fuller for longer and is good for heart health			2
it also boasts plenty of vitamins such as calcium and iron			2
the only downside is that it ’s pretty expensive			2
@entity177 how many times have you heard about ‘ good bacteria ’ and wondered what it ’s all about ? you may also have heard about pre and probiotics			2
it ’s all based on the principle that our bodies are absolutely filled with bacteria , most of which are good ; in fact we would n’t be able to survive without them			2
fermented foods , including pickled cabbage , act as a probiotic - encouraging the growth of ' good ' bacteria so it seems right that we should treat them right by adding pre-biotics to our diet to encourage growth of the good bacteria and maybe try a daily probiotic which contain cultures of good bacteria to add to our gut population			1
fermented foods such as yoghurt , cheese and @entity209 pickled ingredients such as @entity210 ( pickled cabbage ) are an example of probiotics			1
are they good for me ? yes			2
there ’s more and more evidence to suggest that having a healthy population of bacteria is important for eveything from a smooth digestion process to preventing side - effects of antibiotic medication			0
taking a daily probiotic is also fairly easy in the form of a probiotic yoghurt or yoghurt drink			1
@entity228 it 's now being claimed that the intake of sprouted wholegrains can have health benefits over and above those delivered with your plain old standard wholegrains such as rice , wheat and oats			0
the theory goes that we harvest our grains prematurely , not allowing them to sprout , like an onion would if left			0
bone broth has a much lower salt content than shop bought soups , helping lower blood pressure when sprouted , we are able to digest the grains more readily and absorb more nutrients such as protein , b vitamins and minerals such as iron and calcium			0
there ’s lots of evidence emerging of their impact on health such as decreasing blood pressure and fighting diabetes			0
should i invest at the supermarket ? maybe			0
they may provide you with lots of vitamins and minerals which you would n’t naturally yield from the standard grain , but they ’re a fairly expensive product			0
you can also find these vitamins and minerals from a varied diet containing plenty of fruit , veg , calcium - rich dairy products ( or alternatives ) , wholegrains and meat , fish or alternatives			0
@entity286 this has recently made famous by the health - conscious chefs the @entity291 sisters			0
in fact , it ’s been around for centuries and has always been used as stock , as a base in soups and saucy dishes			0
it ’s also well - known for its health benefits , with the bone - boiling process leaching out amino acids , collagen - for skin and bone health - and other important vitamins and minerals			0
adding onions or leeks , carrots and celery , and any other old veg that you have lying around , will add antioxidants along with flavour			0
shall i join the club ? yes your mother , grandmother and great - grandmothers have probably been using this recipe for hundreds of years			0
traditionally it is used to add flavour to dishes but it ’s also a great way to add nutrients without much effort			0
plus it has a much lower salt content than using shop - bought stocks , so is much better for your blood pressure			0
... but now a word of warning food fads are named such usually because they ’re an unsustainable fashion trend			1
some can even be dangerous			0
have a think to yourself when you hear of the new craze ; are you being advised to ingest something which sounds inedible ? would i find it hard to keep the changes up long - term ? if so , they ’re probably not a sensible idea			0
another point to remember is that just because they ’re being sold in a health food or wholefoods shop , it does n’t mean they ’re ‘ healthy ’			0
you can still buy chocolate from these shops			0
sorry to burst your bubble , but just because you buy it from a health food shop , it does n’t magically become healthy			0
we would suggest that you do your research before rushing into anything			0
