by @entity0 @entity2 's marijuana enthusiasts are in for a treat			2
while similar consoles do already exist for registered dispensaries in states where the drug is approved for medical use , never before has a machine been aimed at the recreational user ; enabling customers to purchase marijuana directly , rather than over the counter as it were			1
the appropriately emerald - hued @entity4 , manufactured by @entity14 , was unveiled on saturday in @entity15 , @entity2 , stocked with @entity16 marijuana			2
and while the console wo n't be available to the general public quite yet , its first outing certainly generated excitement			0
revolutionary : the green - stocked @entity25 machine was unveiled at a private event in @entity15 , @entity2 on saturday @entity27 , ceo of the machine 's parent company , @entity28 , who spoke to @entity31 , describes the weed - purveying robot as : ' an automated , age - verifying , climate - controlled marijuana dispensing machine			1
' and while it does appear to take the convenience of buying marijuana to new levels of easy , the company claims it has covered its bases in terms of security			0
@entity43 : the dispenser ( pictured ) is aimed at recreational marijuana users in the future , but is still only available for medical - use license holders ' [ the user ] would swipe their driver 's license at which point multiple cameras would allow us to use some advanced biometrics to make absolutely certain that the person who swiped the card is the owner of that card , ' mr @entity27 explained to @entity57 while speaking at the launch			1
' i 'm a father of a 12 - year - old daughter and i would n't want her having access to it , so we paid close attention to that			0
' for those who do meet the right criteria however , it 's a simple case of : ' @entity68 and get verified			0
retrieve products and depart using appropriate bagging solution			0
' hopes for a greener future : @entity75 - based @entity74 ( left ) currently caters for the medical - use only niche but @entity25 ( right ) hopes that it can capitalize on @entity2 's legalization of marijuana for recreational use too the machine is currently housed at @entity16 , an @entity15 medical dispensary ; so will still not yet be available for recreational users ' at this point ' - essentially until the company feels it â€™s ready			1
only last year , @entity85 , ceo of @entity74 , a @entity75 - based weed vending machine for medical use only , predicted that the transition from machines such as his , to those available to the general public such as the @entity25 model , was ' a couple of years down the road '			1
some people want to see this free - flowing marijuana			0
they want to go from federal and state ban to marijuana for everybody ' some people want to see this free - flowing marijuana			0
they want to go from federal and state ban to marijuana for everybody , ' mr @entity85 - also known as ' the @entity101 of medical marijuana dispensing ' - said to @entity105			1
' we do n't believe that can happen			0
in order to gain respect and trust , it 's better to go through gradual , medical adoption			2
' however , since both @entity2 and @entity114 recently legalized the drugs recreational use , it 's likely that a whole wash of ambitious companies will be hot on the heels of @entity25 's business model , and sooner than many predicted .			1

machines already exist on the market in @entity75 medical dispensaries , but the @entity25 machine will focus on the recreational user
