by @entity0 published : 09:20 est , 25 january 2013 updated : 13:04 est , 25 january 2013 a new book about @entity2 on the run after @entity4 shows how governments around the world torpedoed efforts to hunt down the worst of the @entity10 murderers for decades out of ' vested interests '			1
' @entity12 : @entity14 's dictatorships and the @entity15 , ' by @entity17 historian @entity16 , calls the half - hearted efforts of postwar governments a ' coalition of the unwilling			1
' he says the @entity22 feared prosecutions would expose mass collaboration with the @entity2 , the @entity14 feared a spotlight on their own murderous regimes and the @entity28 @entity27 wanted to help ' old comrades ' get away			1
one that got away : the ' perverted @entity31 of @entity33 ' dr @entity32 , ( left ) was able to flee to @entity14 while former comrades @entity35 ( centre ) @entity37 ( right ) were hanged for war crimes these were not the ' little fish ' of the @entity42 extermination programme but people like ' @entity44 ' @entity32 , who chose victims for the gas chambers , and @entity48 , responsible for 150,000 deaths at the @entity42 extermination camp of @entity51			1
while a physician at @entity33 , @entity32 consigned arrivals to the gas chambers and carried out appalling experiments on @entity58 , most of whom died in agony without anaesthetic			2
@entity32 , who murdered hundreds of children in warped medical experiments , died in @entity63 in 1979 another one that governments conspired together to keep free was s.s. colonel @entity67 , one of the developers of the mobile ' gas vans ' used to kill @entity58 before the static death camp gulag was built			1
@entity16 found documents in @entity17 archives which showed that an official of the @entity17 foreign ministry deliberately delayed his own government 's request for his extradition from @entity79 for 14 months in order for him to prepare to flee elsewhere			0
' the @entity17 judiciary in particular was guilty of serious lapses , ' said @entity16 , a history professor who trawled through long - sealed archives to prove the extent of collusion in keeping history 's greatest war criminals at large			0
@entity88 murderer @entity67 was even able to travel between @entity14 and @entity27 as a company rep without hinderance			2
it was n't until 1961 that he was indicted for 100,000 murders but he never faced justice , dying from a heart attack in @entity79 instead after his adopted government refused an extradition request			0
damning minutes of an @entity98 executive committee meeting in 1962 shows up the @entity22 attitude to the killers			2
@entity98 secretary general @entity101 , responding to a request from @entity58 organisations to more vigorously track them down , stormed : ' why should war criminals be prosecuted since the victor always imposes his laws , anyway ? among the @entity2 to escape trial were s.s. colonel @entity67 ( left ) who helped to develop mobile ' gas vans ' and staff sergeant @entity48 ( right ) responsible for 150,000 deaths at the extermination camp of @entity51 ' no international entity defines the term " war criminal			1
' " @entity101 said he regarded the criminal prosecution of @entity42 crimes as ' victor 's justice			0
' ' as henchmen of the @entity121 regime , the @entity22 collaborated with the @entity2 until 1944 , ' said @entity16			0
' they stood opposed to the criminal prosecution of @entity42 crimes			0
' his book will be published in @entity125 later this year .			0
