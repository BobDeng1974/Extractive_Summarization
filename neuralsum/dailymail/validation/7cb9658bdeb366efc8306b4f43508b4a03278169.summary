the non-xv , if you like , had a point to prove but also wanted to create some intensity in the session , particularly at the breakdown , to make sure we were accurate as a team			2
‘ they did that and were a huge challenge for us defensively			0
we had talked in the review of the @entity82 game about being accurate at the breakdown and sharp			1
those components came into play and it was the type of session you need sometimes in the lead up to a big game			0

’ @entity22 conceded that @entity2 needed to clear the air with a no - holds - barred session			1
what he also needed was to see some of his fringe squad operating at that intensity , so he paid close attention to @entity144 centre @entity142 and @entity63 ’s cross-code recruit @entity62			0
