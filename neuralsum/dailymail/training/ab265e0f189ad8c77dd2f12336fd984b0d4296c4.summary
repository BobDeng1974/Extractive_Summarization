by @entity0 @entity2 's decision to remove @entity3 as @entity4 is an act of folly for which our children will pay a heavy price			1
@entity3 is the one man in the @entity10 who entered office with a clear vision of what he needed to change in his department and proceeded to force through his reforms against visceral resistance from the @entity17 , teachers and his own civil servants			1
for four years , he has been a lightning conductor for their hatred			2
now that he is to step down , the prime minister has handed a trophy to his enemies			2
will @entity32 , @entity3 ’s successor , be able to withstand the brickbats and bullying tactics of the @entity17 ? for the bone - idle education system bureaucrats , teachers ’ union bosses and the @entity39 ideologues who dominate the education establishment , @entity3 ’s departure is a cause for rejoicing			1
when he first took on the role , he signalled a revolution by renaming his ministry			0
out went the vapid ‘ @entity48 ’ in favour of plain old ‘ @entity50 ’			0
here , at last , was a conservative education secretary who was not ashamed of old - fashioned views : that children go to school to learn , not to have fun ; that classroom discipline is essential ; that knowledge is better than ignorance			0
the @entity3 revolution has been driven through with messianic zeal			1
although the teaching unions have fought him tooth and nail all the way , the results of @entity3 ’s actions are already transforming the prospects of the younger generation			1
it is a tragedy that the man whose courage and energy started this revolution is now to be denied the chance to finish the job			2
adopted as a boy by an @entity76 family of modest means , @entity3 has risen by his own efforts			1
in the @entity79 of the privileged and the entitled , he was the scholarship boy who made good			0
he also stands in stark contrast to his @entity82 counterpart , the @entity81 , a son of privilege			0
@entity3 ’s great , transformative insight was that our education system had departed too far from the traditional aim of passing on our @entity89 culture — ‘ the best which has been thought and said ’ — in favour of a vague notion of developing ‘ skills ’			1
bravely , he immediately set about filling the intellectual vacuum left by decades of the @entity17 ’s ‘ progressive ’ education policies			0
he did so with a bloody - minded determination to give every child the best possible chance of success in life			0
he insisted that pupils should learn history , especially @entity89 history , as a continuous narrative rather than as isolated incidents : ‘ @entity104 ’ , ‘ the @entity105 ’ , ‘ @entity106 ’			0
he demanded that they should read the classics and learn poems by heart			0
he wanted children to emerge from school as rounded , educated , articulate adults , capable of competing with the best in the world			0
despite his reputation as the teachers ’ bogeyman , @entity3 has inspired hundreds of dedicated young men and women to found new free schools			1
parents have eagerly embraced the greater choice available as they chose a school for their children			0
yesterday , the gloating of the @entity17 over @entity3 ’s demise spoke volumes about how effective he ’d been			1
among them was the far - @entity131 leader @entity130 , who sneered that his departure would be a lovely end - of - term surprise for her members and boasted that their strikes had claimed his scalp			0
reaction : on the front page of the @entity131 website , a huge picture of @entity3 had been posted with the caption : ‘ gone ! ' pictured right , he looks down during his appearance on the @entity140 show earlier this month on the front page of the @entity131 website , a huge picture of @entity3 had been posted with the caption : ‘ gone ! ’ grinning from ear to ear , @entity81 looked as if he could hardly believe his luck			1
on @entity151 , there was crowing from the left - wing commentator @entity152 , who said : ‘ cheers , whoops and other outbursts of jubilation sweep the nation ’s staff rooms as disastrous @entity3 stripped of education and demoted			1
’ @entity3 ’s removal is fraught with risk			1
in his absence , the education department is like @entity164 without the prince			2
will @entity32 , @entity3 ’s successor , be able to withstand the brickbats and bullying tactics of the @entity17 ? already , yesterday , union leaders were calling on @entity32 to abandon his reforms			1
@entity82 remains ideologically opposed to the educational principles and traditional values that underlie the @entity173 revolution			0
the fact that his @entity82 shadow @entity81 pays lip service to free schools and other parts of the @entity3 legacy should not deceive us			2
in a cabinet of conformists , @entity3 has always been his own man			1
in the 20 years that i have known him , both in journalism and politics , i have never once seen @entity3 betray his principles			2
such integrity is very rare in a politician at any time and even rarer in the @entity191 of today			0
@entity2 ’s demotion of @entity3 is a tragic demonstration that he does not understand what his own government will undoubtedly be remembered for			2
together with @entity197 ’s war on @entity89 ’s bloated welfare dependency culture and @entity200 ’s success at the @entity201 , @entity3 got things done			2
when historians look back on the @entity205 , they will recall that it turned round the economy , reformed welfare and started to restore sanity to our schools			0
but by taking his most brilliant minister out of the political front - line , @entity2 has put the future of education in this country in jeopardy			0
n @entity0 is editor of @entity218 .			1

editor of @entity218 believes @entity3 's *ousting* is an act of folly
*suggests* the @entity4 was the one man who had a ' clear vision '
claims his department is now like ' @entity229 '
