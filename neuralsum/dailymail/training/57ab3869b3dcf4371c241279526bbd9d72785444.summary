@entity0 is demanding a £ 10 billion carve - up of @entity3 ’s @entity2 – including aircraft , ships and the transfer of up to 9,200 regular and @entity8 troops – if @entity10 votes for independence			1
the @entity13 leader insists his country ’s share of the @entity3 ’s military assets should be handed over free of charge so his government can form its own navy , air force and army			1
but last night , experts said his asset - stripping of @entity3 ’s @entity2 would severely damage the @entity3 ’s military capability			1
policy documents reveal the full inventory of supersonic jets , fully armed warships and army battalions the @entity10 nationalists expect to get their hands on if there ’s a ‘ yes ’ vote this thursday – with the @entity40 facing the heaviest losses			0
from the current fleet – already the smallest in the @entity40 ’s 500 - year history – they want two fully armed @entity46 frigates , such as the @entity10 - named @entity47 and @entity48 , four anti-mine vessels , two offshore patrol vessels , up to six patrol boats and a number of auxiliary support ships			2
the @entity13 also says it needs 2,000 regular sailors and 200 reservists and expects the @entity40 to provide most of these personnel			2
@entity0 is demanding a £ 10 billion carve - up of @entity3 ’s @entity2 – including aircraft , ships and the transfer of up to 9,200 regular and @entity8 troops the nationalists also expect the @entity64 to provide ‘ most of the equipment ’ needed to get @entity10 ’s air force off the ground			1
this raises the prospect of the @entity64 supplying up to 12 @entity71 combat jets , six @entity73 transport aircraft and a squadron of up to ten support helicopters such as @entity76			0
the @entity64 is also expected to provide personnel to help the @entity13 reach its target of 2,000 regular airmen and 300 reservists			0
from the @entity26 , the @entity13 wants three infantry battalions – with the @entity10 - raised @entity83 , @entity28 and @entity84 most likely to go – and other units too			1
included on the party ’s shopping list are two light armoured reconnaissance units , two light artillery units , engineering and aviation units , as well as troops expert in areas such as communication , transport , logistics and medical services			0
the @entity13 leader insists his country ’s share of the @entity3 ’s military assets should be handed over free of charge so his government can form its own navy , air force and army @entity108 chiefs are already committed to spending £ 36 million in golden - handcuffs payments in a bid to keep highly skilled personnel			1
but with the @entity13 pledging to improve soldiers ’ terms and conditions , experts said the enticements might amount to ‘ bribes for troops ’			2
professor @entity120 said : ‘ you could get issues of competition between the @entity10 and @entity3 forces			1
’ @entity8 and explosives and ordnance personnel would be handed over too			0
the @entity13 says that to recruit the 3,500 regular troops and 1,200 reservists it requires , it will negotiate with the @entity108			2
but mr @entity0 ’s plans came under attack last night from a former head of the @entity40 , @entity132 , who said : ‘ these reductions to the @entity40 , the @entity64 and the @entity26 would have a major impact on the @entity3 ’s defensive capability			2
our capability to defend the @entity137 will be diminished and the @entity10 wo n’t have the ability either			0
we ’ll all lose out			0
’ how @entity10 will establish its defence forces by 2016 – when independence would be declared in the event of a ‘ yes ’ vote – was questioned by professor @entity120 of the @entity143			1
he said last night : ‘ it is not realistic to manage all these capabilities by day one and how long it takes would rely on the level of @entity3 support			0
while 9,000 troops sounds affordable it is not realistic to increase the numbers of personnel to 15,000 [ the @entity13 ’s ten - year target ] on the same £ 2.5 billion annual budget			1
’ an @entity108 spokesman said : ‘ @entity10 is safer and better defended as part of the @entity3 , protected by the full range of @entity3 defence capabilities , and benefiting from the manpower , bases and military equipment that the @entity163 provides			1
’ @entity10 ' @entity164 will get just 720 spies to fight terror by @entity167 for the @entity168 an independent @entity10 will leave the rest of the @entity3 exposed to acts of terrorism from groups such as @entity173 , security experts warned last night			1
they say that on the day of independence @entity10 will lose the services of @entity178 , @entity164 and @entity179 and the rest of the @entity3 ’s intelligence - gathering operations			1
its newly created @entity10 security and intelligence agency is expected to be left with just 720 spies to defend the new state – and it will no longer be able to rely on the cooperation of the @entity187 agencies , who view @entity10 with deep suspicion after the release of @entity191 bomber @entity190			0
an independent @entity10 will leave the rest of the @entity3 exposed to acts of terrorism from groups such as @entity173 , security experts warned @entity194 , the former independent reviewer of anti-terrorism legislation , said : ‘ there have been many terrorist issues which have been of shared interest to the police in @entity10 , the @entity3 and the various control authorities			1
it ’s hard to imagine @entity10 would be anything like as secure if it obtained independence			0
' it would be very difficult for the new security agency because any serving security service personnel would be @entity3 and their contractual loyalties would be to the @entity3 , not @entity10			2
’ @entity208 , an expert on the threat posed by @entity211 extremists , said that there were ‘ real concerns ’ over how @entity10 would be able to monitor returning jihadis			0
he said : ‘ they will lose a lot of capability and as result the rest of the @entity3 would be more vulnerable			0
’ expert analysis by the @entity143 , @entity3 ’s leading defence and security think - tank , concludes @entity10 will be excluded from the ‘ five eyes ’ intelligence sharing programme of @entity3 , @entity187 , @entity224 , @entity225 and @entity226			1
and former security minister @entity132 warned that @entity3 and @entity187 could be forced to spy on @entity10 , which will be considered an alien state			2
if @entity10 does n’t have the resources or wherewithal to guard against @entity232 extremists who have returned from @entity233 and @entity234 then the @entity3 will have no choice but to treat @entity10 as hostile			2
he said : ‘ from the moment they separate they become a foreign country			0
as far as @entity164 is concerned , they ’re aliens			0
they have n’t thought this through			0

@entity0 wants aircraft , ships and the transfer of up to 9,200 regular and special forces troops if @entity10 votes for independence
