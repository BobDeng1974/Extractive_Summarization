by @entity0 published : 05:55 est , 20 november 2012 updated : 06:54 est , 20 november 2012 a woman was left in agony after her hot water bottle burst scalding her chest and arm			1
@entity6 , 63 , needed a skin graft and spent eight days in a specialist burns unit			2
she leapt into a cold bath at her home in @entity11 , @entity12 , until paramedics arrived			0
' i was in the bath for about an hour i did n't want to get out it was so painful , the heat on my chest was unbearable , ' she said			2
@entity6 with the burst hot water bottle that left her with painful burns researchers at @entity22 say that the numbers needing hospital treatment for hot water bottle burns has risen in the last two years			1
but they say these admissions only represent a handful of the true numbers suffering injuries as most will not go to hospital			0
the researchers say rising numbers of families are using them as a ' cost - effective ' way of staying warm in the hope of saving on their energy bills			2
another reason for the increase is that people are buying cheap hot water bottles from abroad made from rubber that easily perishes			1
mrs @entity6 , 63 , said : ' the hot water bottle i used was only about 14 months old			1
' i will never use one again			0
i 'd warn people to think twice about using them			0
now i use a cherry stone or wheat bag for warmth			0
' mrs @entity6 said she took a covered hot water bottle , that she had bought at a high street store , to bed after feeling unwell			1
but as she pulled it on to her chest the bottle split and hot water , poured from the kettle just half an hour earlier , emptied on her chest and down her left arm			1
mrs @entity6 said : ' a five to six inch split just appeared and i was covered in hot water			1
' i screamed for my partner to come up , i took my cotton top off and put cold flannels on			0
' we rang @entity64 who advised me to get in a cold bath and call for an ambulance			0
' mrs @entity6 had a skin graft at @entity69 in @entity70 paramedics dressed her wound and took her to @entity73 where she was given morphine and from there she went to @entity69 , @entity70 , to be assessed			2
she added : ' they thought i may not need a skin graft , but when i went back for another appointment there was one patch on my left breast that had a deep burn			0
' i ended up needing a skin graft taken from my thigh			0
it is still painful at the movement is difficult			0
the graft site on my thigh is also very sore			0
' mrs @entity6 still has regular appointments at the @entity88 and @entity89 at @entity69			2
@entity90 , @entity91 at @entity22 , said : ' it is clear there is a need to increase awareness of the ability of hot water bottles to cause significant long - term burn injuries			1
' we encourage people to look for the @entity102 safety standard when buying hot water bottles			1
' the @entity64 does not compile figures on the numbers of patients needing treatment for hot water bottle burns			1
but last year more than 1,800 were admitted to hospital following injuries caused by hot water or other hot fluids , which would include hot water bottles .			2
