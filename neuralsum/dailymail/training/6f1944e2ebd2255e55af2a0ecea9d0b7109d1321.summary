a taxpayer - funded youth group has drawn up controversial plans for @entity3 ’s first school for gay , lesbian , bisexual and transgender pupils			1
@entity7 wants the school to cater for children aged 13 and older who have been bullied and hopes the idea will be copied across the country			1
organisers yesterday denied that the school would become a ‘ ghetto ’ for gay children and said mainstream schools can be ‘ one of the last bastions of homophobia ’			1
@entity31 , the group ’s strategic director , said the idea was based on the @entity34 in @entity35 , named after the @entity37 politician later played by @entity38 in a @entity40 movie			1
she visited the @entity42 school last year , and said she had secured a meeting with officials at the @entity45			0
but @entity47 mp and former education minister @entity48 said : ‘ we need to do a lot more to combat homophobic bullying and to create a more tolerant society			1
@entity53 , 14 , killed herself in misplaced fear that her @entity56 parents would reject her ‘ but i can not see how segregating a group of young people identified by their sexuality can aid better engagement and understanding			1
‘ the way to achieve more integration , understanding and empathy is not by segregating members of one group , and this would seem to me to be a step backwards from achieving tolerance			1
’ @entity74 deputy leader and education spokesman , @entity71 said : ' this idea does nothing but foster division			2
“ at a time that successive governments have closed all but a few special schools , why this sudden exception , if not for reasons of political correctness ? “ integration is the key to understanding , and it is utterly bizarre to be taking a step that highlights differences and adds nothing of value to a child ’s education			1
' miss @entity31 said her organisation has carried out a survey of gay , lesbian and transgender young people which found many felt teachers had been unsupportive and in some cases simply urged them to ‘ ignore ’ bullying			0
‘ teachers in mainstream schools have problems in tackling issues like homophobic bullying and coming out , ’ she said			1
‘ unfortunately , schools can be one of the last bastions of homophobia			2
‘ we have also seen tragic cases such as that of @entity53 , a 14 - year - old who committed suicide in a park in @entity117 because she was struggling with coming out and was worried about telling her parents			1
‘ it ’s to combat problems like those that we want to work with schools and pupil referral units to help young people who are struggling in mainstream education			1
’ the group received a grant for £ 63,000 from the @entity128 to enable it to purchase the building where it is based , the @entity131 in central @entity117			2
and it used part of the funding to conduct a feasibility study into setting up a school			0
miss @entity31 paid for the visit to the @entity37 out of her own pocket			0
miss @entity31 said that by coincidence education secretary @entity139 was also visiting the @entity34 last year at the same time she was there			0
she also praised the ‘ climate of change ’ within the department towards homophobic bullying in schools			2
city : city council officials in @entity117 ( pictured ) say they are open to the idea , which is in early stages a source close to education secretary @entity139 told the @entity152 : ‘ there is simply no way that we will approve a free school specifically for @entity158 young people			2
‘ pupils regardless of their sexuality should be educated in mainstream schools which should be equipped to tackle any bullying that should occur			1
’ miss @entity31 said the proposed school would also be open to pupils who were not gay or transgender but felt more comfortable in such an environment and those who are questioning their sexuality			0
critic : mp @entity48 said the idea would segregate students from one another even more @entity7 is a regional organisation that seeks to support lesbian , gay , bisexual and trans young people in the @entity176			1
it receives funding from a raft of state funded bodies , including the region ’s councils and parts of the @entity184			2
it also says its work is ‘ supported by ’ the @entity186 , @entity187 and @entity188			0
miss @entity31 said she intends to wait until after the @entity189 to decide whether to go ahead with an application to set up a free school , with the first pupils starting in around three years ’ time			0
she said around two - thirds of the anticipated 60 pupils would be full - time , with the rest attending for around a day a week from their usual schools			1
‘ the last thing we want is for young people to fall out of mainstream education permanently , or for this to become a ghetto for lesbian , gay and bisexual students , ’ she said			0
‘ this would be somewhere that students who are struggling with the negative effects of issues like bullying could attend classes for a period of time while ensuring they get the grades they are capable of			0
’ she said children would not be enrolled in the school as their first - choice secondary , but referred there if they were having problems in mainstream education , potentially staying for a year or more			2
a spokesman from the @entity128 said the grant was to help the group purchase the community centre from @entity224 and was not to set up a school			2
a spokesman said : ‘ the @entity128 has not funded this school			0
’ ‘ rather , through the organisation @entity229 , grants have been given to local areas wishing to run buildings for community uses			0
’ a spokesman for @entity224 said : ‘ we supported @entity235 in their bid for funding to look at the feasibility of expanding their premises and developing the work they do			0
‘ one of their development ambitions is around how they might make additional educational support available to @entity158 young people			0
we ’ve had an initial discussion with them about that , but there are no current plans that we ’re aware of to open a @entity158 school in the city			0

centre for 60 *teenagers* is by taxpayer - funded @entity7
group says it could *prevent* suicides like that of @entity53 , 14
but @entity262 said idea would not reduce *prejudice* in mainstream schools
