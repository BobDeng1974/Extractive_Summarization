without @entity1 , @entity0 would be bottom of the @entity3			1
without @entity1 , @entity4 probably would n’t be in a job			1
and this , do n’t forget , is the same @entity1 with whom the management team had become disillusioned during his season - long struggle for form and fitness last time around			1
they kept faith and , now , the future of @entity4 and the club rests with their no 9			1
@entity1 ( centre ) beats @entity17 to ball to score @entity0 's first goal against @entity20 @entity1 ( right ) scores his and @entity0 's second goal to rescue a point against @entity20 @entity20 keeper @entity23 is left helpless as @entity1 celebrates scoring his second goal indeed , in scoring four goals from three matches already this season , he has doubled his league tally from the entirety of last term			1
his point - saving braces – against @entity31 and now @entity20 – mean @entity4 will remain in charge until they face @entity33 at @entity34 a week on saturday and almost certainly beyond			1
@entity35 remain in the bottom three and without a win in seven , equalling their worst run from the outset of a @entity3 campaign			2
but @entity1 has given his under - fire boss a timely lift			1
for no matter his declarations of ‘ strength ’ and ‘ resilience ’ , the strain was beginning to show			0
‘ you need that player who can score under pressure and when you need one desperately – he did that twice , ’ said @entity4 , reflecting on @entity1 ’s close - range hook from an impossible angle and his poached finish to salvage a draw			1
‘ he gives us a real cutting edge			0
his first goal is top drawer , trust me			0
to score from that angle is very difficult			0
the second goal again was very good technique			0
to have him back and scoring goals is huge for us			2
@entity1 gestures to manager @entity4 after scoring his first goal @entity4 congratulates @entity1 on his two goals as the striker is substituted some @entity0 fans continued to call for @entity4 to be sacked before the match @entity4 was relieved to get a point against @entity20 after another troubled week at @entity0 ‘ i can now hopefully look to the next game			1
it ’s a massive chance to get a win and we ’ve got to try and take that			2
’ @entity1 ’s goals cancelled out @entity73 ’s 17th - minute opener and former @entity76 @entity75 ’s second - half dink which restored @entity20 ’s lead , and sent them momentarily to joint second			1
@entity0 ’s @entity81 striker also netted twice during a 2 - 0 win at the @entity83 in april , 2012 and that was in the midst of a run which included 11 in eight games			1
but @entity1 was making his first start on saturday since breaking his kneecap in april , and insists he ’s still some way off his free - scoring best			1
‘ for me i ’m not “ back , back ” , ’ he said			0
‘ i ’m not on fire ! i ’m just working hard at the moment			0
i got an opportunity and i scored , i ’m just doing my job			1
@entity73 edges out @entity95 before scoring @entity20 's first goal @entity75 chips the ball over @entity0 keeper @entity98 to score @entity20 's second goal ‘ but i need to do a lot more for this team , i need to get better			1
two years ago i was like fire , scoring goals , but last year it was n’t that way			2
i need to keep going			0
’ owner @entity107 was there to witness @entity35 ’s comeback , but still there were calls for him and @entity4 to go			2
one cutting protest banner read : ‘ @entity113 ’ – not a @entity114 , our form in 2014 ′			2
and @entity1 admitted : ‘ it ’s a very difficult time for the team			2
it ’s three points we need			0
it ’s not easy , it ’s very hard at the moment			0
‘ the fans are not happy			0
the players need to believe in themselves and work hard , and it will come good			0
the @entity3 is not easy			0
it ’s not finished yet			0
we ’re only a few games into the season , maybe it will turn			2
‘ this moment is not easy for the manager , and it ’s not easy for the players too			0
it ’s about belief and working hard and one day maybe we will come good			0
’ @entity1 is certainly coming good for @entity4 right now .			1

striker scored twice as @entity0 drew 2 - 2 with @entity20 on saturday
@entity0 's no 9 has now scored four goals in three games this season
@entity1 struggled for form and fitness last season
@entity143 keeps @entity4 in a job but @entity0 still without a win in seven
