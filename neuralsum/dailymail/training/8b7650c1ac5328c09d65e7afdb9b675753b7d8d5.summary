by @entity0 published : 16:03 est , 21 september 2013 updated : 05:56 est , 22 september 2013 they look worlds apart – a trunk road buzzing with traffic and the stunning beauty of remote heathland			1
yet these astonishing photographs show how what was once a notorious traffic bottleneck has been returned to nature			0
just two years ago , the busy @entity11 skirted the edge of the @entity14 ’s @entity13 , near @entity15 in @entity16			1
now the road has vanished – moved deep underground – where more than 1,000 vehicles an hour thunder unseen through the £ 371million , 1.25 - mile @entity35			1
before it opened , this stretch of the main @entity38 to @entity40 road was regularly clogged as drivers were funnelled on to its single lanes between sections of dual carriageway			2
more jams were caused by traffic lights as the @entity11 wound through @entity15 village			1
today , the @entity13 is reunited with @entity22 and the peace and quiet of the old route are a tribute to nature ’s ability to regenerate itself			1
now the road has vanished - moved deep underground , where more than 1,000 vehicles an hour thunder unseen through the £ 371m , 1.25 - mile @entity35 @entity57 construction of the tunnel started in 2008 and when it opened in july 2011 it became the longest under - land road tunnel in the @entity60			1
the development is said to have reduced peak - time journeys by 20 minutes			2
above ground , the project has opened up new routes for joggers , cyclists and ramblers – among them @entity70 star @entity69 who is regularly seen walking his dogs on the common			0
and wildlife has benefited too			0
protected birds such as @entity76 warblers , woodlarks and nightjars , and heathland species such as silver - studded blue butterflies are now colonising the new wilderness for the first time in living memory			2
before the @entity35 opened , this stretch of the main @entity38 to @entity40 road was regularly clogged as drivers were funnelled on to its single lanes between sections of dual carriageway @entity90 , owner of the @entity14 ’s @entity91 in @entity15 , said : ‘ we ’ve seen a large increase in walking groups and cyclists and ramblers and people coming here for the day from @entity38			1
‘ the difference is the lack of traffic here now			0
it used to take five or ten minutes just to cross the road			2
’ around 92 per cent of the soil shifted to create the tunnel has been relaid on top of the old road , sown with heather and planted with 200,000 new trees and shrubs as part of a @entity113 restoration project			2
the @entity114 and its contractors , @entity116 , also landscaped the area to begin to restore it to its natural contours , using 320,000 cubic metres of soil			0
@entity120 , 76 , a member of the @entity121 and @entity122 , said : ‘ since the tunnel opened , it has transformed the whole place			0
‘ the air quality is amazing and the noise levels nil			0
‘ the fact the old @entity11 is now a path is lovely			1
and over time it will only get better			0
‘ you really get the feeling you are in the middle of nowhere			0

the busy @entity11 used to skirt the edge of the @entity14 ’s @entity13 , near @entity15 in @entity16
road has now gone , moved deep underground , where over 1,000 vehicles an hour pass through £ 371m , 1.25 - mile @entity35
