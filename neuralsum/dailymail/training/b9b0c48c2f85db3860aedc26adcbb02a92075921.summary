the image of a smiling and waving @entity1 in his presidential limousine moments before he was assassinated is burned into the national consciousness			1
we all know the outcome of that tragedy , but one of the key pieces of evidence from the day - the @entity10 limousine - went on to serve four more presidents before it was finally retired in 1977			2
the car draws crowds at the @entity15 in @entity16 , @entity17 , where it ended its long journey			1
historic artifact : the @entity1 presidential limo is now drawing crowds at the @entity15 when president @entity1 was assassinated in 1963 , he was riding in a motorcade through @entity24 in the 1961 @entity26 four - door convertible			1
completely open at the top , the car , code - named @entity28 100 , had no armor or bullet - proof elements whatsoever , a fact incomprehensible today			0
' the tires were not bulletproof			0
there was no bulletproof glass			0
it did have a removable plastic top , but , again , it was just @entity39 , ' @entity36 , curator at the @entity15 , told @entity40			2
' it was no , no bullet resistance in that material			0
it 's amazing to think of it , but they just did n't anticipate that kind of problem			0
' uncomfortable : president @entity48 , @entity48 seen here in the @entity51 limo with wife @entity52 , never liked traveling in the car in which president @entity1 had been killed the custom - built car cost $ 200,000 and had features including retractable steps for @entity60 agents and two radio @entity62 's assassination , the car was driven directly back to the @entity64 so it could be examined as part of the investigation			1
' they determined that the most practical thing to do was just to rebuild this existing car rather than to start from scratch , so , yes , they took the car down to the frame and rebuilt it as a true armored vehicle , ' @entity36 told @entity40			0
' the biggest change they made in modifying the car was putting in a permanent roof that could not be removed , and they surrounded the whole vehicle with bullet - resistant glass			0
' third president : @entity83 had a hole cut in the top of the car so he could stand to wave to crowds the @entity64 approved a plan for a re-vamp of the car in december 1963			2
it was completely armored , a top was added and it was given a paint - job in ' regal @entity93 with silver metallic flakes that glitter under bright lights and sunshine			1
' @entity48 was two cars behind @entity1 the day of the assassination			1
after he was sworn in as president , he occasionally had to ride in the car			0
according to @entity36 , he disliked the blue paint job the car had been given because it was too similar to the original color			0
long service : actor @entity106 campaigns with president @entity107 in the presidential limo in 1976 , the year before the car was retired from the @entity51 fleet unforgettable : despite 50 years passing since @entity1 's death , the tragic day remains fresh in the collective consciousness of @entity113 it was promptly painted black , but @entity48 was never comfortable riding in the car and avoided it whenever possible			1
when president @entity83 had use of the car , he had a hole cut in the roof as a hatch , so that he could stand up and wave at crowds			2
presidents @entity107 and @entity123 also used the car , until it finally reached the end of the road and came to a stop at the @entity15 .			1

following the @entity1 assassination , the presidential limousine was put back into service
it was completely armored and a roof was added
the 1961 @entity10 limo served presidents @entity48 , @entity83 , @entity137 and @entity123
it is now on *display* at the @entity15 in @entity16 , @entity17
