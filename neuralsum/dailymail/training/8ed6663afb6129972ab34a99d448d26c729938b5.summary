the image board site soon grew to by much more , and quickly became one of the biggest websites in the world			0
the biggest difference between 4chan and other websites however is that it allows commenters and contributors to post anonymously , giving many free reign to do things they would not do otherwise			2

@entity244 users hacked his site , and the overwhelming winner was @entity238			0
the @entity247 did not ultimately make the trip			0
@entity249 – in what may have been their most vicious attack to date , members of @entity244 began to cyberbully an 11 - year - old girl after claiming she was having a relationship with an older man			2
