by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 22:35 est , 15 october 2012 updated : 18:11 est , 16 october 2012 @entity3 's biggest task tonight in the second presidential debate will be to woo back ‘ waitress moms ’ so crucial to his re-election , after a poll showed @entity6 has stole their votes in the first showdown and they are now neck and neck among women voters			1
according to a @entity17 / @entity16 poll of 12 swing states , @entity6 leads @entity3 by 12 points among men			1
but it is his surge among women voters to within one point of @entity3 that has given him a four - point overall lead that sets him on course to win the @entity26 on november 6th			1
the poll , released on the eve of the second presidential debate in @entity30 , @entity31 , marks an apparent end to months of double - digit @entity3 leads over @entity6 among women and has plunged @entity35 into panic mode			1
debate prep : president @entity3 spent the weekend in @entity38 , @entity39 preparing for the debate while @entity6 based his debate preparations at a @entity42 in @entity43 , @entity44 new format : unlike the first debate , the second meeting will be in a ' town hall ' format in which undecided voters will pose questions to the candidates unlike the first debate , the second meeting will be in a ‘ town hall ’ format in which undecided ordinary voters – probably about a dozen – will pose questions			1
at least half of them are likely to be women			0
in addition , the debate will be moderated by a woman - @entity63 ’s @entity62			0
@entity35 traditionally enjoy a marked advantage among women			0
@entity67 ’s 1996 re-election was said to have been based on winning over middle class , aspirational so - called ' soccer moms '			0
but @entity3 ’s popularity among females has plummeted after @entity6 ’s commanding debate performance in @entity73 nearly two weeks ago			2
vice-president @entity75 's bullying display over @entity6 's running mate @entity76 also left many women voters feeling alienated			1
tied : @entity6 is now neck and neck with president @entity3 among women voters , according to a new @entity17 survey within an hour of the @entity17 survey being released , the @entity3 campaign – which recently mocked @entity83 for questioning poll methodology , went on the offensive against the 75 - year - old polling firm			1
reporters were sent a memo from @entity3 pollster @entity90			0
in it , he said : ‘ ' the latest @entity17 / @entity94 survey showing president @entity3 and governor @entity6 tied with women in battleground states ( 48 - 48 ) is an extreme outlier , defying the trends seen in every other battleground and national poll , ' said @entity90			1
overall , @entity6 has 50 per cent of support among likely voters in the 12 battleground states , while @entity3 is trailing with 46 per cent support , according to the survey			1
without winning women , @entity3 's path to victory in november is complicated , if not impossible			2
the memo includes a chart of selected surveys from a handful of battleground states that give @entity3 a 10 - point lead over @entity6 among women nationally			1
' this implausible result among women appears to not even provide an accurate reflection on the electorate today , making its value questionable , ' @entity90 insisted			0
women tend to start paying close attention to election campaigns later and are more open to persuasion than men			0
this makes female voters , particularly the blue - collar ‘ waitress moms ’ whose families have been hard - hit by the recession and unemployment , the most - prized group of swing voters in 2012			1
fighting for women : female voters , particularly the blue - collar ‘ waitress moms ’ whose families have been hard - hit by the recession and unemployment , are the most - prized group of swing voters in 2012 @entity140 , a veteran @entity35 pollster , told ‘ @entity16 ’ : ‘ in every poll , we 've seen a major surge among women in favourability for @entity6 ’ since the @entity73 debate			1
‘ women went into the debate actively disliking @entity6 , and they came out thinking he might understand their lives and might be able to get something done for them			2
’ unlike the first presidential debate , tonight 's debate will be in a ' town hall ' format , meaning candidates will answer questions from members of an audience , rather than a moderator			2
there are 80 audience members total , which were selected by @entity17 from a sample of undecided voters who live near the debate 's location in @entity30 on @entity169			0
the participants had to submit their questions ahead of time			0
the debate moderator , @entity63 's @entity62 , will decide who to call on during the debate based on her reviews of their submitted questions			0
the candidates will have two minutes to respond to each question , after which the moderator can ask a follow - up question of her choosing			0
the candidates will have one minute to respond to the moderator 's question			0
the ' town hall ' format is designed to be more relaxed and conversational , with the candidates free to walk around the forum instead of remaining confined behind a podium or a desk			0
but the format also lends itself to more opportunities for unplanned or candid events , such as the 1992 debate where president @entity197 was caught on camera checking his watch			0
she added that while @entity3 currently maintains an edge among women voters , the changed views of @entity6 could be ‘ a precursor to movement ’ in greater numbers towards the @entity83 nominee			1
‘ it opens them up to take a second look , and that 's the danger for @entity3			0
' @entity35 were scrambling monday to maintain their historical edge among female voters			0
party officials held a conference call in an effort to raise alarm over how a @entity83 administration would impact women 's lives negatively and the progressive group @entity221 released an ad starring three @entity224 actresses who claimed @entity83 would try to end abortion rights for women			0
the @entity6 campaign , on the other hand , touted the survey 's findings as proof that women are increasingly concerned about the economy instead of issues like birth control			2
republicans said the survey shows women feel @entity6 is better equipped than @entity3 to spur economic growth			2
@entity6 's path to winning a greater share of the female voting bloc has been long and arduous			2
he trailed the president by 18 percentage points among female voters in a @entity17 survey from april , around the time that @entity35 were attacking @entity83 for ' waging a war on women ' by supporting legislation that would limit insurance coverage for contraceptives			1
that 's when @entity6 's advisers decided to step up the visibility of his wife , @entity256 , on the campaign trail to try and make @entity6 more relatable as a husband and a father			2
wooing women : first lady @entity261 and @entity6 's wife , @entity256 , have been helping their husbands appeal to women on the campaign trail the campaign also organized ' women for @entity6 ' grassroots groups in battleground states across the country and began cutting dozens of television ads that featured clips of @entity256 talking about mr @entity6 's ' softer ' side			2
the strategy has helped @entity6 slowly chip away at @entity3 's lead among female voters and after the president 's decidedly lackluster debate performance earlier this month , @entity6 appears to be finally closing the gender gap			1
as @entity6 looks to maintain the progress he 's made among female voters , he 's likely to tread lightly on topics such as abortion and birth control during tonight 's debate -- and to pivot back to the economy whenever possible			1
introducing @entity256 : @entity6 's advisers decided to step up the visibility of his wife , @entity256 , on the campaign trail to try and make @entity6 more relatable as a husband and a father in the lead : overall , @entity6 has 50 per cent of support among likely voters in 12 battleground states , while @entity3 is trailing with 46 per cent support , according to the @entity17 survey high stakes : president @entity3 's supporters are hoping for a stronger performance from their candidate in tuesday 's debate after his lackluster first performance president @entity3 , on the other hand , will be looking for every opportunity to remind female voters of the measures he has enacted while in office that target women , such as the @entity312			1
he will also be looking for every chance to remind women that that he was raised by a single mom and that he is the father of two daughters .			0

@entity6 is heading into the second presidential debate with a four - point lead over president @entity3 , according to the latest @entity17 survey
@entity6 's lead stems from a recent surge in support from women voters
female voters , particularly the blue - collar ‘ waitress moms ’ whose families have been hard - hit by the recession and unemployment , are the most - prized group of swing voters in 2012
@entity3 's campaign is *criticizing* the poll numbers as *skewed* and ' extreme '
