when thinking of secretaries , one ’s mind could slip to the glamorous women walking around the @entity5 offices of @entity6			1
but data shows that the most common occupation for women today is still the same , with around 4million @entity11 women working as administrative assistants			1
the information comes as something of a shock , as better access to higher education has allowed women to enter in a highly competitive job market			1
working women : census data from 1950 and 2010 shows that the number one job for women has been secretary in both cases , though the job is more @entity29 , citing the most recent census data , says that of the 4million workers who worked as administrative assistants between 2006 and 2010 , a full 96 percent were women			1
the most common job in 1950 was also for the role of secretary			1
the website notes that generalists – that is , people who have a variety of skills needed in an office environment – are always in high demand			0
that could help explain why nurses and nursing aides were the fourth and fifth most common jobs , respectively			1
the data could be surprising to some who still picture secretaries as either naïve typists from @entity50 , such as @entity52 ’ character @entity51 in ‘ @entity53 , ’ or curvaceous sex kittens like @entity55 ’ @entity56			0
but following the @entity58 , there was the need for extensive paperwork , filing , and scheduling to replace what was once a largely agrarian society			0
according to the @entity66 , administrative assistants have steady work with a median pay of around $ 34,600 annually , or $ 16.66 per hour			2
mad women : @entity56 and @entity51 from @entity70 's ' @entity53 ' both started as secretaries and endured harassment from their male co-workers the @entity66 predicts that between 2010 and 2020 , the date of the next national census , the field will grow 12 percent			2
2010 median pay : $ 34,660 annually / $ 16.66 per hour entry - level education : high school diploma or equivalent number of secretaries in 2010 : 4,010,200 job outlook in next ten years : 12 % employment change between 2010 - 2020 : 492,000 source : @entity66 the information is contrasted by the best jobs for women , which , according to @entity88 , are diagnosing doctors , other health professionals , medical scientists , and lawyers			1
the role of secretary was one that , until the 1880s , was predominately filled by men , according to the @entity98			2
but with the invention of the typewriter , more women entered the workforce , many of them working as typists or filling other clerical positions			0
by the 1930s , many secretarial positions were filled by women , and by the age of ‘ @entity53 , ’ most every office had secretaries , typists , and other such workers			0
a movement in the 1970s turned the tables on the term ‘ secretary , ’ and fought against some of the ways these workers were treated in the ‘ @entity53 ’ era			0
and , as the @entity122 notes , administrative assistants today do much more than take down correspondence and file paperwork			0
many of them also serve as office administrators , managing the workflow of entire offices .			0

administrative assistant still *top* most common job for @entity11 women
however , job *descriptions* and expectations of role has changed *significantly*
