babies are ten times more likely to develop autism if they have a brother or sister with the condition , according to the biggest - ever study of its kind			1
it found that a child ’s risk of being diagnosed with the developmental disorder also doubles if they have a cousin with the condition			1
the study of two million children came after scientists at @entity19 were asked by numerous parents what their chances were of having a second autistic child			1
discovery : babies are ten times more likely to develop autism if they have a brother or sister with the condition , according to a new study			1
the risk of being diagnosed also doubles if they have a cousin with the disorder the study looked at the medical records of all children born in @entity39 between 1982 and 2006 , to see how those with autism were related			1
of the two million children , 14,516 were diagnosed with an ‘ autism spectrum disorder ’			2
those on the spectrum find it difficult to socialise with other children , and struggle to read the subtle signs in people ’s speech , faces and body language			0
however , there is a wide range in how badly sufferers are affected and how they respond			0
research site : the study of two million children came after scientists at @entity19 ( pictured ) were asked by numerous parents what their chances were of having a second autistic child some withdraw into their own worlds , rarely smiling , while others react with aggression or obsessively follow repetitive routines			1
many need substantial support into their adult lives , with some parents left struggling to cope			0
study author dr @entity69 , of @entity19 and the @entity70 in @entity71 , said parents with an autistic child needed to think carefully about enlarging their family			2
‘ some will want to avoid having another autistic child , but for others it wo n’t be a problem , ’ he added			0
but dr @entity79 , of the @entity80 , said parents of autistic children were ‘ well aware of the significant challenges involved in raising them ’			0
she said : ‘ parents can only make a decision about having another child based on what ’s best for their family			0
’ she also noted that many of those who develop the condition are born into families with no history of it			0
autism is much more common in boys than girls ; overall , the chance of having a boy on the autistic spectrum is about one in 50			2
this increases to one in five if the boy is born to a couple who already has an autistic child			0
accountable : ' environmental factors ' - such as premature birth - account for 50 per cent of a child 's chance of being autistic , says the study			1
but most of these factors appear to be outside the control of parents ( file picture ) by contrast , the chance of a girl having autism is lower , at about one in 200			2
consequently , the chance of a baby girl developing the condition if she also has a sibling with it is one in 20			0
the study , published in the @entity128 , also found genes account for 50 per cent of a child ’s chance of being autistic , with ‘ environmental factors ’ accounting for the remaining 50 per cent			1
previous studies of twins have suggested genes play an even higher role – as high as 90 per cent			0
but dr @entity69 said most of these environmental factors – such as premature birth – appeared to be outside the control of parents .			1

babies ten times more likely to develop autism if sibling has it , says study
researchers found risk also doubles if child has cousin with the disorder
study by @entity19 looked at records of two million children
genes found to account for 50 per cent of child 's chance of being autistic
' environmental factors ' , like premature birth ' , account for other 50 per cent
