a shocking video that appears to show @entity2 rebels torturing a group of @entity5 detainees has appeared on @entity6			1
the footage shows a dozen or so men - suspected by @entity2 rebels of fighting for the toppled government of @entity12 last year - held in what looks like a caged zoo enclosure			1
they each have their hands tied behind their back and are sat on the cage 's dirty floor			2
more objectionably , each has the old @entity2 flag stuffed into his mouth			2
the man filming the scene , who remains off - camera , can be heard shouting : ' eat the flag , you dog			2
patience you dog , patience			2
' it is impossible to verify whether the video , which was leaked onto @entity6 last week , is genuine and where and when it was filmed			1
it has emerged as the @entity54 this week said that the @entity2 revolutionary brigades accused of torture still hold captive three - quarters of detainees from the country 's civil war			1
a lack of judicial police has prevented the government from taking control of more jails , the @entity54 said on wednesday			2
up to 6,000 detainees are estimated to remain in brigade facilities , while the @entity68 has taken charge of eight detention centres holding 2,382 people			1
the figures were revealed to the @entity73 by @entity74 , the @entity54 special envoy for @entity2			2
many of the detainees are @entity77 whom their captors accused of being @entity12 mercenaries , based in some cases purely on the fact that they have darker skin			1
jeered : the men are suspected of fighting for the toppled government of @entity12 last year humiliating : while a crowd of men gather round the enclosure shouting , their prisoners are made to hop on the spot the @entity54 human rights agency and aid groups have accused the brigades of torturing detainees during @entity2 's nine - month civil war			1
mr @entity74 has urged the @entity68 to accelerate the process of asserting government control over detention centres			0
but he said : ' progress continues to be complicated by insufficient numbers of judicial police			0
' he added : ' we will continue to work closely with the authorities and to encourage them to ensure that inspections of known facilities are undertaken , that secret locations are identified and brought under government control , and that abuses are investigated			0
' accusations of the mistreatment and disappearances of suspected @entity12 loyalists are embarrassing for @entity2 's ruling @entity116 , which has vowed to make a break with practices under @entity12 and respect human rights			1
it is also awkward for the @entity122 powers which backed the @entity124 rebellion and helped install @entity2 's new leaders			0
the @entity73 meets in @entity126 on wednesday			0
it heard that up to 6,000 detainees are estimated to remain in @entity2 brigade facilities racism ? rebel fighters hold captive a @entity5 man out of control : rebel fighters question another sub-saharan as they search for @entity12 army soldiers in @entity136 in august @entity12 's 42 - year rule collapsed when his forces fled @entity136 in august , and the last of the fighting in @entity2 ended in october when he was captured and killed by rebels			1
@entity2 ambassador @entity142 told the @entity73 that detainees held by the government , including a number of former @entity12 ministers and senior officers , were treated well			1
mr @entity142 said : ' however , let me say that there are areas where the state has not been able to control			0
there is not police or courts in those areas			0
' we can not be responsible for all excesses everywhere			0
we are against them , we object to them and we hold the perpetrators of such acts responsible			0
' mr @entity74 said that while the armed brigades lacked clear lines of command and coordination , they continued to perform important security functions often for long periods without payment			0
he said : ' contrary to the impression given by some media reports , although they seek guarantees that the transformation for which they have fought is securely on track , there is little indication that they wish to perpetuate an existence outside state authority			0
