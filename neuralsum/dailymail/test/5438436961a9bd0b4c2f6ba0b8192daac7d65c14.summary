it will not worry @entity2 one iota that his victory over @entity4 on friday night may have lacked the drama or controversy that accompanied their @entity8 semi-final in january			1
instead the world no 4 – next week to be world no 3 – was all business as he produced a performance of clinical excellence to take down the powerful @entity14 6 - 4 6 - 4 in an hour and 42 minutes			1
he is through to sunday 's final of the @entity16 where the @entity17 will face his growing nemesis , @entity18 after he dispatched @entity19 in straight sets			1
@entity2 reacts as he reaches the @entity16 final with a 6 - 4 , 6 - 4 win over @entity4 @entity2 reacts after winning the final point before shaking hands with @entity4 as he heads into the final the @entity14 star could not contend with @entity2 's selection of shot making in @entity29 it will be @entity2 ’s first masters level final since he won the title in what is his home from home two years ago			1
that fact backs up the belief that he is returning to the kind of form last seen from him in the first half of 2013 , which led to him winning the @entity41 title			0
since then there has been back surgery , a new coach in @entity45 and a revamped support team and all manner of setbacks			2
but a @entity50 final , making the last four of @entity52 and now the final here tells the story of his improvement this season			2
occasionally there have been periods of wandering concentration in the past week but his mind was very focussed			0
it may have helped that ex assistant coach @entity63 was sitting in @entity4 ’s corner accompanied by ex-fitness coach @entity65 , who is now also working with the @entity14			1
but there was none of the highly - charged atmosphere of that night in @entity69			0
@entity70 , who he is marrying next week , kept a much lower profile this time , hidden beneath the wide - peaked straw hat protecting her from the fierce @entity29 sun. the 27 - year - old was in clinical form as he set up a final showdown with @entity18 there is no love lost between @entity2 and @entity4 , especially after this year 's @entity8 semi-final @entity2 was annoyed after @entity4 asked for one of the balls to be taken out of play during the first set both players thought it necessary to question the umpire as events unfolded in the first set @entity4 questions the chair umpire following an overruled call at the @entity92 evnt @entity2 and his close friend @entity63 have now regained the equilibrium in their relationship , but the @entity17 admitted afterwards that there are still extraneous factors with him playing @entity4 , who he does not especially like			1
“ it was different from then ( @entity69 ) for sure , but it was still not easy even if it appears that way , ” he said			0
“ it ’s still a bit tricky and not a comfortable situation			0
i ’m quite pleased with the way i have handled the emotions in both these matches			0
” @entity2 has played more matches on this @entity111 court than any other outside @entity41 ’s @entity112 and the @entity113 , and knows what to expect in conditions that are usually heavy and humid with a brisk breeze			2
@entity2 's fiancee @entity70 was back in the stands wearing the same wide brimmed hat @entity4 's model fiancee @entity119 cools down with some water as she watches her beau @entity2 's former coach @entity122 ( left ) and trainer @entity65 ( right ) switched camps to join @entity4 “ when the conditions are like that , @entity124 can still generate a lot of power			1
but when i 've played him on some of the quicker surfaces , i feel like i 've been able to hit through the court and make him move a lot			0
“ it ’s been a long five or six weeks for me so i wanted to try and conserve as much energy as i can			0
i obviously have some days off next week to relax			0
” @entity2 had a fairly clear game plan , taking some speed off his first serve to increase its percentage and not allow @entity4 too many looks at his more vulnerable second delivery			2
he also sought to exploit the 6 ’ 5 ” @entity14 ’s slightly cumbersome movement and prevent him from hitting too many of the bazooka forehands that had helped the @entity14 forge a 6 - 5 record in their previous encounters			1
@entity2 stretches to make a return as he battles to win a place in sunday 's final @entity2 can not hide his delight as he throws his sweatbands into the crowd after the game @entity2 , now sure to overtake @entity153 in the rankings to close on @entity155 at two , took advantage of two wobbly @entity4 service games at the start of each set , but was then unable to hold his serve before breaking again			1
the only whiff of controversy came after four games of the match when @entity4 , whose whingeing makes @entity2 appear positively laidback , complained about the state of the balls			1
it did not impress his opponent			0
at this time of year it might be appropriate to describe him as doubting @entity170 and @entity2 was in such purposeful mood , and serving so consistently , that he comfortably held onto his lead in both sets .			2

@entity176 no 1 *defeated* @entity4 6 - 4 , 6 - 4 to reach @entity16 final
there 's no love lost between the pair after controversy at @entity8
@entity122 and @entity65 switched from @entity2 's team to the @entity14 's
