by @entity0 published : 04:55 est , 29 april 2013 updated : 09:48 est , 30 april 2013 as summer arrives and sleeveless dresses hit the shops , many women will look mournfully at their less - than - toned arms			1
it is , therefore , possibly no surprise that plastic surgery to reshape the upper arm is soaring in popularity			1
the latest statistics released by the @entity11 ( @entity11 ) show that arm lifts in women have rocketed more than 4,000 per cent in the last decade			1
@entity15 's toned arms are thought to be inspiring people to undergo arm lift procedures the report says that the trend is fuelled , in part , by sleeveless fashions and more focus on strong - armed celebrities			1
in 2000 , more than 300 women had upper arm lift procedures in @entity26			1
last year , more than 15,000 did			1
@entity27 is a procedure to remove excess skin and fatty tissue from the upper arm			1
it is normally carried out under general anaesthetic and involves a cut being made from the elbow up to the armpit			0
this allows for the removal of the excess tissue meaning that the circumference of the arm reduces			0
the procedure leaves a thin scar along the inside of the arm			0
complications involve persistent swelling of the arm , infection , bruising and bleeding			0
there can also be nerve damage which causes numbness in the arm			0
upper arm lifts can include liposuction or a surgical procedure known as brachioplasty , in which loose skin is removed from the back of the arms			1
‘ women are paying more attention to their arms in general and are becoming more aware of options to treat this area , ’ said @entity11 president @entity60			1
‘ for some women , the arms have always been a troublesome area and , along with proper diet and exercise , liposuction can help refine them			1
‘ others may opt for a brachioplasty when there is a fair amount of loose skin present with minimal elasticity			2
’ doctors say there is no single reason behind the increase , though celebrities from the @entity83 to the red carpet may be having an influence			2
a recent poll conducted on behalf of @entity11 found that women are paying closer attention to the arms of female celebrities			1
actresses @entity92 ( left ) and @entity93 ( right ) have some of the most admired arms according to the poll , women most admire the arms of first lady @entity15 , followed closely by @entity92			1
actresses @entity93 and @entity98 , and daytime tv talk show host @entity99 , were also recognised for their toned arms			1
‘ i think we are always affected by the people that we see consistently , either on the big screen or on tv , ’ said @entity103 chair @entity102			0
‘ we see them and think , “ yeah , i 'd like to look like that ”			0
’ that is what happened to 24 - year - old @entity113 of @entity114 , who says she was inspired by the arms of the first lady			1
‘ i looked at @entity15 and said “ oh my gosh , i want her arms ”			2
when i first started losing weight and started to tone up , i had her image in my head			0
’ that was three years ago			0
today , ms @entity113 has lost more than 12 stone and continues an amazing transformation through diet and exercise			0
actress @entity98 ( left ) and talk show host @entity99 ( right ) were also named as people with enviable arms however , despite losing so much weight , ms @entity113 says she still was not entirely happy			2
‘ i had a lot of excessive skin around my upper arms , ’ she said			1
‘ every time i looked in the mirror there was a reminder of a heavier person and i just could n't get rid of it			0
’ as a result , ms @entity113 contacted dr @entity102 , who performed a brachioplasty			2
‘ @entity113 had the perfect arms for this procedure , ’ said dr @entity102 , ‘ but it 's not for everybody			2
’ in 2012 , 15,457 people in the @entity26 had an arm lift			1
this was an increase of three per cent since 2011 and 4,473 per cent since 2000			2
of those patients , 15,136 were women			2
the surgery is most popular with patients over 40			2
the majority , 43 per cent , of patients were aged between 40 and 54 , 33 per cent were over 55			0
the average cost of the operation was £ 2,500			0
a brachioplasty requires an incision from the elbow to the armpit , generally on the back of the arm , leaving a visible and permanent scar			2
for ms @entity113 , the scar was much easier to deal with than the excessive skin , but dr @entity102 warns patients to carefully consider the pros and cons before having an upper arm lift , particularly a brachioplasty			1
‘ it 's a trade - off			0
we get rid of the skin , but we leave a scar , ’ he said			0
‘ so , as long as there 's enough improvement to be made in the shape of the arm to justify the scar , then it 's a great procedure			0
’ dr @entity102 stresses the importance of proper diet and exercise as part of a healthy lifestyle to all his patients , but says some women simply can not achieve the look they want on their own			2
many who simply want to tighten and tone their upper arms , but do n't have a lot of excess skin , opt for liposuction instead of a brachioplasty			1
‘ we are genetically programmed to have different accumulations of fat in different areas , and for some women the arms can be a problem area , ’ said dr @entity102			1
‘ the arms are a very noticeable area and if excessive fat and skin are an issue , they tend to look more out of proportion than the rest of the body			0
’ that was certainly the case for ms @entity113 , but not anymore			0
she says she never expected surgery to make her arms perfect , just more normal			1
‘ well - proportioned is what i was going for , and i 'm very happy			0
it was well worth the investment , ’ she said			0
‘ i would do it again			0
