a @entity1 family has received more than £ 23,000 in compensation from a tour operator after their @entity5 holiday was ruined when each of them fell ill with ‘ horrendous ’ gastric symptoms			1
@entity9 , his wife , @entity11 , and their 26 - year - old son , @entity12 , all suffered stomach cramps , diarrhoea , vomiting , fever and headaches during their two - week stay at the @entity20 hotel , southeast of @entity21 , in october 2011			1
@entity11 , 45 , was diagnosed with gastroenteritis and is still suffering from gastric - related symptoms , although her husband and son have both made a full recovery			2
compensation : the @entity30 family fell ill while staying at a @entity31 in @entity5 @entity32 still suffers from symptoms three years after the nightmare holiday @entity9 , 47 , told @entity35 : ‘ she ’s still quite bad			1
she came back with a very bad case of gastroenteritis and every now and again she ’s still really bad with it			0
‘ this has just really sort of rocked her			0
’ in their claim , the family , from @entity40 , @entity41 , complained about unsanitary conditions in the three - star resort ’s restaurant			2
they said chicken was undercooked , food was served on damaged and dirty crockery on occasion , and uncovered and reheated food was left out for long periods of time			0
they also claim to have seen cats roaming free in the restaurant			0
the family fell ill just a few days into their two - week stay at @entity61 in october 2011 @entity9 , formerly a manager in the food and drink industry , said : ‘ we were appalled by the state of the restaurant when we arrived and it is n’t something i expected from a three - star resort , it was disgusting			1
‘ we even overheard staff at one point saying that they would not eat in the restaurant			0
‘ we all fell ill with horrendous symptoms a few days into the holiday			1
this meant that we were not able to go on any excursions or explore the local area as we had hoped because we had to stay at the hotel as we felt too ill to travel			0
‘ my wife is still suffering with stomach issues which she finds very uncomfortable and at times embarrassing			0
we did not expect our annual holiday to turn out the way it did			0
‘ we are pleased that our legal battle is now over and feel like we can finally move on from our ordeal			0
’ the @entity87 say their ' horrendous ' symptoms prevented them from going on excursions the @entity87 , who booked online with @entity90 , hired solicitors from @entity92 to pursue a claim against the @entity95 - based tour operator			1
@entity92 said @entity90 denied any liability and a £ 23,600 settlement was reached after it issued court proceedings			1
@entity99 , a legal specialist with @entity92 ’s international personal injury team said : ‘ what was supposed to be a lovely family holiday with their son became ruined by illness			0
the family saved up hard for their trip and it ended up being one they will never forget , for all the wrong reasons			2
‘ @entity90 denied liability , @entity113 proceedings were therefore issued			1
‘ we are pleased that a settlement has been agreed that reflects the illness each family member endured while at the hotel , and also takes into account the on - going altered bowel habits @entity11 faces as a result of the holiday			1
’ @entity35 has contacted @entity90 for comment .			2
