@entity0 and @entity1 received mixed news on tuesday as @entity3 insisted it is ‘ business as usual ’ following a shoulder scare — only for club captain @entity6 to be ruled out for the season			1
@entity3 pulled out of saturday ’s @entity9 opener against @entity10 after experiencing pain as a result of a stinger he suffered in pre-season			1
given @entity18 ’s injury history — he sustained a career threatening neck injury two seasons ago and last year needed extensive surgery on torn knee ligaments — there were fears the @entity0 and @entity26 flanker could be facing another extended spell on the side - lines			1
but , speaking exclusively to @entity30 , the 28 - year - old revealed he is fit and ready to face @entity31 at @entity32 on saturday			2
business as usual : @entity26 flanker @entity3 told @entity30 he is ready to make his comeback blow : @entity0 lock @entity6 will be sidelined for several months after undergoing knee surgery ‘ it ’s business as usual as far as i ’m concerned , ’ he said			1
‘ i felt a bit of a twinge in the shoulder in training last week and we decided the safer option was to miss one game rather than risk a longer period of time off			2
the idea is to play against @entity31			0
‘ it ’s the first full pre-season i ’ve had for a long time and i ’m feeling really good			0
i ’ve put on some weight and am weighing in around 109kg ( 17st 2lb ) but the speed tests say i ’ve maintained my speed			0
‘ i ’ve got a new knee and a new neck and i ’m feeling stronger and fitter than i have done in years			2
my hunger for success is as strong as ever			0
’ the news was not so good for @entity3 ’s team - mate @entity6			1
the highly regarded lock , a member of @entity0 ’s elite player squad and an outside bet for next year ’s @entity61 , had knee surgery last week to repair damage sustained playing for @entity0 against @entity64 in @entity65 in june			2
‘ it ’s horrific for @entity6 in many ways , ’ said @entity1 director of rugby @entity66			1
‘ it ’s a critical year for us and for him with the @entity61 coming up and the likelihood is that he is not going to play a game between now and pre-season next year			0
’ @entity6 played on for 20 minutes after suffering the injury , which was only spotted when he returned to @entity1 following the tour			1
confirmed : @entity1 boss @entity66 made @entity77 his captain at the start of the season ‘ he has had his acl reconstructed and he will be pretty much out for the season , ’ @entity66 added			1
‘ those things do n’t show up well on scans and it looked relatively ok , so the first option was to rehab it and see how it settled			0
but it was n’t settling so we had another look and it ( @entity91 ) was hanging on by a thread so the surgeon put him back together			0
’ @entity6 was not the only @entity0 hopeful to be dealt an injury setback as @entity96 revealed their 24 - year - old goal - kicking full back @entity97 , who missed the bulk of last season with a groin problem , suffered significant knee ligament damage in saturday ’s loss to @entity106			1
meanwhile premier @entity107 have ruled out any possibility of a change to the structure of the league following calls from @entity115 chief executive @entity114 to scrap the play - offs and introduce a fixture list more akin to @entity119 football , with the side finishing top of the table at the end of the regular season being crowned champions			2
@entity115 lost last season ’s play - off final in the dying minutes of extra time to @entity129 after topping the league by nine points			0
‘ there are no plans to change the structure of the competition , ’ said a premier @entity107 spokesman			0
@entity139 wing @entity137 has signed a new deal that will keep at the @entity141 until 2017			0
reinforcements : @entity65 lock @entity143 has joined the @entity1 ranks			1
