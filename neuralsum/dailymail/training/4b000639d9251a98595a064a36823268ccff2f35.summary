by @entity0 published : 05:42 est , 23 march 2013 updated : 07:02 est , 24 march 2013 around one in five @entity2 students have disappeared without paying back millions of pounds in loans to study at @entity5 universities			1
twenty - two per cent of students from @entity8 member states have not be ' traced ' after graduating - leaving @entity5 taxpayers to pick up the bill			0
a study by the @entity12 , reported by the @entity13 , revealed that @entity8 students were much less likely to repay their loans at all and more likely to go missing			1
studying : students from @entity8 member states are allowed to apply for government loans to take @entity5 courses in the past six years almost £ 400 million in @entity19 loans had been made to students from @entity2			1
@entity5 taxpayers handed out more than £ 100 million in loans in 2010 - 2011 to fund the @entity5 education of those from countries such as @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29			1
these students can apply for the same government support as @entity5 students to complete courses here , but critics do not believe the repayment of their debt is as vigorous in their own countries			2
the @entity5 system of repayment means students reduce their debt with direct payments to the taxman through @entity43 when salaries are over £ 21,000 a year			2
working : almost a quarter of @entity8 students disappeared without making repayments on their loans there are fears that hundreds of millions of pounds in loans to @entity8 students may be written off and the bill is likely to rise with the introduction of tuition fees of up to £ 9,000 for the first time last september			1
the @entity13 reported that parliamentary research carried out for @entity57 mp @entity56 , analysed @entity8 students who claimed loans up to 2010			0
it found that @entity8 students were ' much more likely to have not been traced ' after graduating , with 22 per cent failing to tell the @entity59 where they were			0
this compared with just two per cent of all borrowers			0
mr @entity56 told the paper : ' i think this should raise serious questions with the government about how effective we are at getting our money back through the student loans system			0
' this is clearly an issue that needs a lot more attention particularly as tuition fees rise			0

in the past six years almost £ 400 million in government loans had been made to students from @entity2
