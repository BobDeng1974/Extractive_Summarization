a woman who has spent 13 years trying to find a couple whose wedding photo she discovered in the rubble of 9/11 got the thrill of a lifetime yesterday when she finally got to speak to someone from the picture , and learn that all are alive and well			1
every year since the horrible attacks took place in @entity12 , @entity9 has posted a scanned image of a photograph of six people at a wedding , and each year she got no response			1
the man she located was the photo 's owner , @entity28 , who had it on his desk on the 77th floor of 2 @entity23 when the building collapsed back in 2001			1
he is pictured in the background of the photo , taken at a friend 's wedding			2
the photo came into ms. @entity9 's possession back in october of 2001 , when a friend who uncovered it in some of the rubble near the sight passed it off to her , and asked that she do something meaningful with it			1
and after 27,000 retweets from the likes of @entity54 yesterday , that something meaningful finally happened she was able to speak to mr. @entity28 , who still lives in @entity12 with his wife , @entity56			2
he was quick to thank both mr. @entity54 and ms. @entity9 on @entity58			0
safe and sound : photo owner @entity28 's wife @entity61 is seen here new friends : @entity28 ( right ) who had the photo at his desk on the 77th floor of 2 @entity23 , tweeted out his thanks to ms. @entity9 for seeking him out ( left ) ' it 's a beautiful , joyful moment captured in time and it was such a contrast to what i saw at @entity71 , which was still burning when i was there , ' ms. @entity9 told @entity72			1
' so , if it had a relationship to 9/11 , i wanted to keep it safe until i could return it to its owner			0
there 's so much beauty and happiness in the photo that i just felt committed to the task			0
' ' every year i go dig it out , ' @entity9 told the @entity85			0
' i ’ve been posting it for years , and it ’s literally never gone anywhere			0
' ' i ’ve never dismissed the idea that it could just be a photo that was in a neighboring building that had its windows blown out , ' @entity9 also told the newspaper			2
' i ’ve tried over the years to resist putting a story to it			0
' @entity28 's wife @entity61 is seen here			0
