@entity1 president @entity0 has hit out at @entity2 , claiming he can ' get the hell out of our way ' if he does not want to return to the @entity6			1
@entity2 , who signed for the @entity8 club six months ago on a four - year - deal , is currently being paid £ 90,000 a week and has played 16 matches for his new side			1
despite scoring 11 goals in his time there - an impressive goals - per - game ratio - @entity2 is said to be looking for a premature end to his spell in the @entity16 , in favour of a move back to the @entity19			2
@entity2 has not settled well into the @entity6 , and wants a quick return to @entity24 deadline day moves to @entity26 and @entity27 fell through , but the former could still be an option for @entity2 speaking at @entity30 , @entity1 president @entity0 said : ' i personally do n't think @entity2 will come back			1
i think if he does n't want to be here you get rid of him			0
' my attitude is , if you want to be here and buy into what we 've been doing , let 's go ... i will be with you every day			0
if you do n't want to be here , get the hell out of our way			0
' @entity2 was linked with deadline day moves to @entity26 and @entity27 , but after both fell through the @entity47 striker is said to be exploring other avenues			0
@entity1 though , are in pole position when it comes to selling the want - away forward			0
@entity2 still has three - and - a - half - years left on his deal , and his club will want to hold out until january to enable them to recoup some of their £ 6 million transfer fee			1
@entity0 was quick to compare @entity2 to @entity56 , a success story of promoting the @entity6 around the globe			1
' has @entity2 ultimately adapted as well as @entity56 did ? ' @entity56 had more character , more grit , more determination than any player i 've ever been around			2
never once did he run , hide or fade away			0
' @entity2 has been with @entity1 for less than a year but he could be on the move again			2

@entity2 is likely to leave @entity1 in the near *future*
@entity2 moved to the @entity6 this *summer* , but wants to return to @entity24
the *31* - year - old @entity70 striker is currently being paid £ 90,000 a week
he is only six months into a four - year - deal , but is unlikely to play again
@entity1 president @entity0 says @entity2 has not adapted well
he compared @entity77 to @entity56 , who ' never ran or hid ' in the @entity6
