by @entity0 published : 09:01 est , 24 july 2013 updated : 09:01 est , 24 july 2013 a grieving twin has pledged to complete the bucket list her sister never could - and demands on it include going to a gay bar , getting arrested , and ' farting loudly in a lift '			1
cystic fibrosis sufferer @entity8 , 21 , had been preparing for a life - changing double lung transplant last month when she took an unexpected turn			1
her twin @entity12 was in @entity13 when she got the call saying @entity8 had just hours to live			1
she rushed back to @entity15 in @entity16 in time to say a final goodbye			1
wicked sense of humour : @entity8 , who died last month aged 21 , and wrote a bucket list that her twin sister @entity12 is planning on completing for her now @entity12 is determined to complete her sister 's 57 bucket list wishes , which includes getting tattoos , jumping out of a plane and posing naked for a life art class			1
she has already bought a pair of shoes worth more than £ 100 - some pink strappy high - heels from @entity31 - and named a star @entity8			1
@entity12 said : ' @entity8 wrote down so many things she wanted to do but her illness did n't allow her to do them			1
' it 's funny how many of them involved nudity ! but that was @entity8 - she loved a laugh			1
' one thing i do n't do is heights so i wo n't be jumping out of any planes , but i 'll do everything else i can			2
' i 've had friends and family , some overseas in @entity47 and @entity48 , get in touch to say they want to help , which is just as well			1
' doing it for my sister : @entity55 is planning on carrying out everything on the bucket list of her late sister @entity8 the girls ' father @entity59 , 59 , said : ' i think @entity8 was a wee bit fly when making that list			1
' it 's as if she knew she would n't manage to do all of those things herself and that @entity12 would end up taking it on			1
she had a wicked sense of humour			1
' when @entity12 made it to the hospital @entity8 was already unconscious			1
@entity12 said : ' she could hear me , she definitely could			1
i said " i love you " and she twitched			2
she knew better than to die before i got back to see her one more time			1
' @entity8 was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis as a baby but all the way through primary we were very similar			1
' it was in high school that our lives became very different			2
she was in and out of hospital and taking up to 30 pills a day and on oxygen 24/7			2
our parents bought a camcorder to take with us on holiday when we were five and there 's footage of @entity8 singing @entity89 songs , flinging back her feeding tube as if it was her hair			1
' that 's what she was like			1
she was positive and funny and tried to make us all feel good			2
' the girls : @entity12 , left , and @entity8 were very similar throughout primary school but their lives became different in high school when @entity8 started spending more time in hospital and taking up to 30 pills a day the family also hope to start a trust fund in @entity8 's name to support young cystic fibrosis sufferers and their families			1
their mother @entity104 , 56 , said : ' there are no respite centres for cystic fibrosis sufferers in @entity109 , and i know it would have really helped us when @entity8 was unwell			1
' once charitable status has been confirmed , people will be able to donate to the trust and log on to the site to watch @entity12 and her friends power through the list			1
