by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter @entity4 nurses failed to act on a doctor 's order to maintain a constant watch on @entity8 , the @entity9 patient who was found dead in a stairwell 17 days after going missing from her hospital bed			1
citing the results of a @entity15 investigation , the @entity12 claims a doctor instructed staff in writing that the 57 - year - old was never to be left unattended			1
the report contradicts the account hospital officials gave after @entity22 's body was discovered			1
they said nurses were instructed to check on @entity22 every 15 minutes			2
both the hospital and the @entity27 share in the blame for the death of @entity22 , whose body was found in a stairwell more than two weeks after she vanished from her room september 21			1
@entity8 , 57 , was missing over two weeks before a worker stumbled across her decomposed body in the stairwell of @entity4 the hospital , along with the @entity27 , have been found to share in the blame of @entity8 's death , with nurses failing to keep proper watch of her family and friends spent days distributing these flyers all over @entity45 , believing the hospital had properly checked the premises and that @entity8 had wandered off into the streets she was admitted to the hospital on september 19 for a bladder infection and disorientation			1
a day later she wandered into a nursing station saying she worked at an airport , with a doctor reminding a nurse that @entity22 required around - the - clock observation			0
on september 21 she vanished			1
the hospital said both they and police conducted a thorough search of the premises looking for @entity22			1
her body was eventually found by a maintenance worker on october 8 , more than two weeks after she went missing			1
the stairwell where she was found was never searched			0
the probe was conducted by state health inspectors on behalf of the @entity15 - the federal agency that decides whether hospitals meet minimum standards to be eligible for @entity15 payments - and involved interviews of dozens of hospital staffers and sheriff 's deputies			2
the report has not been publicly released but was obtained by @entity12			0
it found ' systemic ' failures at the hospital and said officials there never worked out an emergency plan with the @entity27			0
@entity8 officially died of dehydration and liver problems associated with alcoholism			0
medical examiners were unable to determine exactly when she died after being missing for 17 days that created the risk of a ' chaotic and poorly coordinated ' response that led to @entity22 's death , the report said			2
the hospital and @entity27 have both said they are making changes to avoid a repeat of what happened			0
' many of the changes outlined in the ( report 's corrective plan ) already have been implemented , and we can assure ms. @entity8 's family , and all our patients , visitors and staff , that we are a safer organization today , ' hospital officials said in a statement to @entity12			2
@entity105 , the @entity22 family 's attorney , said the report revealed a startling number of breakdowns			0
' this defies logic that the sheriff blames the hospital and hospital blames the sheriff and nobody did anything to find @entity8 , ' he said			2
hospital officials told the investigators that they have long wanted to replace the @entity27 and contract out for better security , but have been barred from doing so by the board of supervisors every year since 2009			0
the probe concluded that the hospital 's inability to upgrade security alone resulted in the death of @entity22 , 57 , who had been admitted for treatment of a bladder infection and for being disoriented			1
but the hospital itself bears plenty of blame for what happened to @entity22 , the report said , starting with nurses ' failure to carry out written orders two days before she vanished : " never leave patient unattended			1
" an autopsy found @entity22 died of dehydration			2
she also had liver problems related to alcoholism			0
the autopsy was unable to determine her time of the death , but found it was several days before she was found			0
her family and friends spent days distributing flyers around the city , believing she had wandered off from the hospital and that the hospital had been properly searched .			0
