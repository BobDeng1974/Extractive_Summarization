by @entity0 published : 04:35 est , 23 november 2012 updated : 07:07 est , 23 november 2012 two nurses who ignored the plight of an epileptic girl who died after she inhaled her own vomit in a hospital bed face being struck off			1
@entity6 , 17 , suffered five seizures in the space of 24 hours after being admitted to the @entity9 in @entity10 , @entity11			1
but senior nurses @entity13 and @entity15 failed to ensure she was looked after properly as the 17 - year - old ’s brain was starved of oxygen , a tribunal heard			1
neglect : nurses @entity15 , left , and @entity21 , right , failed to properly care for epileptic teen @entity6			1
she suffered five seizures in the space of 24 hours and died after choking on her own vomit @entity15 had witnessed two of @entity6 ’s fits , one of which lasted for six minutes			1
@entity6 died four days later , with hospital neglect contributing to her death in march 2007			1
they both face being struck off after the @entity29 panel in central @entity11 found the nurses ’ fitness to practice impaired by reason of misconduct			0
panel chair @entity34 said : ‘ the failure to ensure neurological observations were undertaken and recorded was a breach of duty of care serious enough to constitute misconduct			0
‘ every patient must always be monitored and observed , and these observations recorded			0
this requirement is so basic that every nurse should be aware of it			0
tragic : @entity6 had learning disabilities and was a life - long sufferer of epilepsy ‘ not doing so makes it is impossible to accurately assess whether the condition of the patient is improving or deteriorating and make decisions on whether to call for medical intervention , which must be taken expeditiously			2
‘ the panel notes the coroner ’s finding in this case that basic standards of practice for neurological observation were not followed			0
‘ while not attributing blame for the death , this observation serves to underline the potential risk to patients if standard observations are not undertaken			0
’ @entity13 was in charge of the @entity67 where @entity6 , of @entity68 , north @entity11 , was taken after suffering two epileptic fits in @entity70			1
she failed to ensure neurological observations were carried out after @entity6 suffered a seizure at 12.10pm , on march 26 , 2007 , and did so again after a fit the next morning at around 7.40am			1
night shift nurse @entity15 admitted failing to ensure observations were taken following three fits during the night			2
@entity6 , who had learning disabilities and was a long - standing sufferer of epilepsy , was admitted to the hospital at 5am on march 26 , 2007 with vomiting and fever			2
both nurses have admitted they failed in the care that @entity6 received in the days she before her death , on april 1			1
failure : the @entity9 in @entity10 , @entity11 , where @entity6 was taken in march 2007 an inquest in march 2008 into @entity6 ’s death heard admissions from hospital staff that basic care had not been given			1
the 17 - year - old had inhaled vomit after a seizure and had suffered irreversible brain damage			2
the hearing resumed this week after being adjourned in august			0
@entity13 , who now works in a care home in @entity99 , earlier told the hearing of her regret over the failures to properly care for @entity6			2
she said : ‘ i would have , looking back in reflection , not stood over the nurses but been near enough to be confident the patient was being looked after			0
‘ i would make sure the observations had been done , not naively expect them to have been done			0
’ asked what she would do differently if she was working that shift again , she replied : ‘ everything			0

@entity6 , 17 , suffered five epileptic fits in the space of 24 hours
@entity21 and @entity15 failed to look after her properly
