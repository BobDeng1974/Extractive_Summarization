* the damiana aphrodisiaca ingredient present in @entity16 ’s elixirs is traditionally used as an aphrodisiac by @entity68			1
@entity19 is a wild shrub that grows in @entity68 , @entity70 , and the @entity71			1
the leaf and stem of the @entity75 leaves have been used as to boost sexual potency by the native peoples of @entity68 , including the @entity78 , for many years			1
historically , it was used primarily as an energy tonic and an aphrodisiac for both male and female sexual stimulation			0
' @entity19 ( @entity83 ) is found throughout @entity68 , @entity70 and the @entity84			1

' in @entity97 it is renowned for its sexual enhancing qualities and positive effects on reproductive organs			0

@entity16 is most well known for being a longevity promoting agent , although this claim is not fully supported			2
it does appear to interact with hormones in the body , both testosterone ( where aside from containing a negligible amount , it can enhance testicular production of testosterone ) and estrogen ( where it increases estrogen in post-menopausal animals , and might selectively reduce the effects of estrogen in youth )			0
however , these effects on hormones are quite unreliable and hard to predict although they occur at reasonable dosages			0
