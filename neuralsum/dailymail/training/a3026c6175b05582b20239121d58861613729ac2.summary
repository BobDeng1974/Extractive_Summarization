cinnamon could be a secret weapon in the battle against @entity3			2
scientists have found that the spice is the source of a chemical that can protect the brain			0
our liver converts cinnamon into sodium benzoate , an approved drug used in the treatment for neural disorders			1
in a study of mice at @entity18 in @entity19 , a team of researchers found that the chemical then enters the brain , stops the loss of proteins that help protect cells , protects neurons and improves motor functions			1
@entity28 ( left ) and @entity29 ( right ) have both been diagnosed with @entity3 's			2
the study shows that cinnamon could potentially be one of the safest approaches to halt disease progression in patients lead researcher professor @entity36 told the @entity37 : ‘ cinnamon has been used widely as a spice throughout the world for centuries			1
' this could potentially be one of the safest approaches to halt disease progression in @entity3 ’s patients			1
’ professor @entity36 said tests had shown that @entity48 cinnamon is better at halting @entity3 's as it is more pure			2
he said the next step is testing cinnamon on patients with the disease			0
the study found that after being eaten , ground cinnamon is converted into the chemical sodium benzoate , which then enters the brain , stops the loss of @entity57 and @entity58 - 1 , protects neurons , normalises neurotransmitter levels , and improves motor functions in mice with @entity3			1
professor @entity36 said : ' understanding how the disease works is important to developing effective drugs that protect the brain and stop the progression of @entity3 's			2
' scientists have found that the spice is the source of a chemical that can protect the brain			0
our liver converts cinnamon into sodium benzoate , an approved drug used in the treatment for neural disorders parkinson 's disease is a slowly progressive disease that affects a small area of cells within the mid-brain known as the substantia nigra			1
gradual degeneration of these cells causes a reduction in a vital chemical neurotransmitter , dopamine			0
the decrease in dopamine results in one or more of the classic signs of parkinson 's disease that includes : resting tremor on one side of the body ; slowness of movement ; stiffness of limbs ; and gait or balance problems			0
the cause of the disease is unknown , but both environmental and genetic causes have been speculated by experts			0
while one in six patients are diagnosed before age 50 , it is generally considered a disease that targets older adults , affecting one of every 100 persons over the age of 60 .			0

liver converts spice into sodium benzoate - used to treat neural disorders
@entity118 enters the brain , protects neurons and improve motor functions
could potentially be one of the ' safest approaches to halt @entity3 's '
