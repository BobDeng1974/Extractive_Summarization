by @entity0 published : 17:00 est , 7 december 2013 @entity2 : 17:10 est , 7 december 2013 there is nothing initially surprising about @entity5 , near the centre of @entity7			1
at the top is a perfectly standard busy shopping street			1
but a few minutes down the hill , and past a park , there is a large and very pretty cemetery , dotted with yew trees , with lush grass growing among the headstones			1
at the very bottom , before a thick wood of oak trees and behind the iron gate , appears a @entity22 house			1
with gothic arches , stained - glass windows and a sturdy wooden front door , it brings to mind the @entity27 in @entity28			1
authentic : @entity29 , set in the @entity30 in @entity7 , was built in the 1840s for the cemetery groundskeeper a cemetery may seem a strange place to live			1
but if you want a quiet setting , easy access to a busy city centre and an old house with a history , then five - bedroom @entity29 , set in the @entity30 and on the market for £ 390,000 , might be ideal			1
‘ as soon as we saw the lodge , we knew we had to have it , ’ says @entity42 , 70 , who used to run a water taxi business on @entity7 quayside			1
now retired , he and wife @entity48 , 67 , want to move somewhere with more outdoor space for their collection of vintage cars			1
‘ the house was built in the 1840s – about the same time as the cemetery and chapel – for the groundsmen who maintained the graveyard , ’ @entity42 explains			1
indeed , when they moved in , the house was very basic , with just a couple of large rooms and not even a proper staircase			1
the @entity65 have maintained the original church - like feel while also making a cosy living area			1
gothic romance : one of the five - bedroom @entity29 's sitting rooms has stained glass windows ‘ we wanted to create an open - plan space downstairs which was n’t chilly , ’ says @entity42			1
this is successfully achieved by having three rooms – the sitting room , kitchen and dining room – all flowing into each other , with no doors			1
the 15ft - high ceiling of the sitting room has gold mouldings			1
a wood burner ensures that the room is pleasantly warm			1
‘ there is underfloor heating as well , ’ @entity42 points out			2
this comes up through a church - style green painted iron grate			2
all the windows in the house have stained glass			2
in this room , the sun shines through yellow and green glass			2
the kitchen has an @entity97 as well as a double oven – @entity48 finds it easy to cook for 20 when they have the whole family over for @entity102 , including their two children and four grandchildren			2
the dining room leads through to another sitting room – with high ceilings and a massive original fireplace			2
these windows are stained red and blue			2
upstairs are two bedrooms and a bathroom , which the couple use as a master suite , with the smaller bedroom acting as a dressing room			2
it is downstairs – down a winding ornate red iron staircase – that the house takes on a @entity122 - like quality			2
hero : @entity124 was awarded the @entity125 for rescuing wounded comrades during the @entity127 in 1862 here , below the house and where women used to make the funeral wreaths , there are three further bedrooms and two more bathrooms			0
‘ when we have family to stay , we all feel as though we have our own space , ’ says @entity42			0
in the main bedroom , a @entity138 window leads out into the garden , and an en suite bathroom has a @entity142 - style painted red glass door			0
‘ i did that myself , ’ @entity42 says proudly			0
a huge green - tiled bathroom has mirrors around all the walls and a working fireplace next to the porcelain bath			0
‘ @entity149 the fire , light a few candles , and it ’s bliss , ’ says @entity48			0
the garden is walled , with a @entity22 - style summer house and a three - car garage which has a utility room , including a washing machine , sink and toilet			0
‘ this could be used as separate accommodation , ’ muses @entity42			0
he uses it for his vintage car collection , which includes a 1935 @entity164 , one of the procession cars from the funeral of @entity168			0
for some , the thought of being surrounded by gravestones may be disturbing , but in fact there is an air of quiet peace			0
walking up the hill to the chapel , where there is a separate visitors ’ centre and cafe , friendly dog - walkers nod and smile , and the gravestones make fascinating reading			0
on one lies a poppy wreath , left over from @entity186			0
although the engraving on the headstone is now faded with time , captain @entity187 , @entity125 , is still remembered by @entity7 residents			1
the cemetery also contains the final resting place of another @entity125 hero , naval rating @entity124 , who was awarded the honour for rescuing wounded comrades during the @entity127 in 1862			0
when the cemetery ’s gates close every afternoon , the @entity65 ’ grandchildren can play in the 34 acres of grassy cemetery			0
‘ it ’s beautiful and safe for them , ’ says @entity48			0
‘ this stunning @entity207 listed property is one that ’s brimming with character and history , ’ says @entity203 at estate agent @entity204			0
‘ this is one of those unique homes that are rarely available			0
’ @entity212 , 01752 223 355			0
