grand design : the 3,500sq ft property on @entity14 in @entity15 spreads over four floors and includes large rooms with high ceilings , a kitchen , a lift and a staircase with wood and ironwork railings creature comforts : the group of nine - including students and those ' in - between jobs ' - move mattresses into the building ' better than a sleeping bag on a park bench ' : one squatter said it was nice to be able to show that buildings like this can be used in a positive fashion they gained entry to the building , which is classed as a commercial property , through an open window in the early hours of sunday morning			1
the group , who had previously squatted in an empty post office in @entity91 , were evicted from the building two weeks ago			2
the former bank , which is believed to have been empty for around a year , is still connected to both water and electricity , although the internal lift has broken down			2
@entity11 confirmed it is their building			2
police attended to inspect the property , but left after confirming no damage had been caused , that it was a commercial property , and that the occupation was a civil matter			1
home improvements : the former bank is still connected to water and electricity ... although the internal lift has broken down ' too good an opportunity to miss ' : film student @entity110 ( left ) , 34 , and gardener @entity111 , 42 , moved in on sunday after being evicted from an empty @entity112 in @entity91 chill - out zone : the squatters gained entry to the building , which is classed as a commercial property , through an open window the high life : the squatters believe the property would cost around £ 81,000 a year in rent plus more than £ 40,000 in business tax squatter @entity111 , 42 , who has lived in @entity15 for the last three years , said : ' we noticed the building a few weeks ago			1
we were evicted from our previous place and it was too good an opportunity to miss. ' we were last in an industrial unit , it was a bit cold , it ’s somewhat nicer here			0
' this is property owned by @entity29 , private banking			2
it used to be one of their private banking offices and @entity29 , being 46 % owned by taxpayers , they from here advised high yield individuals , specialising in offshore accounts , advising individuals wishing to invest between £ 2million and £ 20million offshore			2
' and while the bankers are still getting bonuses , there are homeless people like us that are trying to get secure accommodation			0
' we are just looking for somewhere to live and as a group of homeless people we ’re enjoying getting one back at the financial system which always seems to get public money thrown at it when they ’re in trouble			0
' bank bashers : the group has hung two large posters on the outside of the property that read ' best squat evah ! ' and ' another banking mess up ! ' nothing to see here : police attended to inspect the property , but left after confirming no damage had been caused said the occupation was a civil matter another squatter , @entity173 , 34 , added : ' obviously it ’s a massive upgrade from having a sleeping bag on a park bench and is nice because of who the owners are and the way it was being used before			1
' it ’s just nice to be able to show that buildings like this can be used in a positive fashion			0
' the squatters expect to be in the building for three to four weeks and have been reassuring their new neighbours that their stay is temporary			0
' the ones that have come up to us have been quite supportive , ' mr @entity111 said			0
' we ’re not going to be partying or causing a nuisance or an annoyance while we are here			0
' in @entity15 you have one in five shops or commercial premises that are empty , that seems to increase by the month , they could be put to use to house homeless people			2
' he added he would like to see a greater understanding of how easy it is to lose a house and become homeless and for more compassion to be shown towards squatters			0
changing rooms : many of the large empty offices have been been or will be converted into bedrooms money matters : the squatters said the bank used to specialise in offshore accounts , advising clients wishing to invest between £ 2m and £ 20m squatters have occupied a number of buildings in @entity15 , including the £ 3 million mansion , @entity218			1
a new law came into force last month that means that people who occupy residential properties without permission could be jailed for six months and / or be fined up to £ 5,000 , as it is now a criminal offence in @entity225 and @entity226			0
in the past , squatting was a civil matter , and the police were only called if criminality was suspected			1
the squatters said the property in @entity14 is classed as a commercial property and therefore is not affected by the new law			1
' it is worrying that last week a 21 - year - old man in @entity236 was sentenced to 12 weeks in prison for squatting in a residential property , ' mr @entity111 said			0
' but this is a commercial building			0
factories , warehouses , pubs , offices have been excluded in the consultation			0
' mr @entity173 added : ' i think that ’s something that ’s going to get worse in the next six to 12 months , with the changes to benefits , under 25s not being able to apply , the age limit being raised from 30 to 35 with regards to single occupancy , and that sort of thing , but also generally as the cuts start to kick in it will start to drag more and more people into this kind of situation			0
