@entity0 and @entity1 had to be pulled apart as they squared off ahead of their strawweight clash in @entity5			1
@entity0 , at only 21 and with just five fights behind her , has already ruffled feathers after being one of a select few to sign an individual contract with @entity11			1
and @entity1 was clearly riled during the traditional staredown in @entity13			2
@entity1 and @entity0 face off during the weigh - in @entity1 and @entity15 will face each other in the @entity17 on saturday night @entity0 steps on the scale during the @entity20 fight night weigh - in event at the @entity21 @entity0 fights for the second time under the @entity20 banner when she takes on @entity1 @entity0 and @entity1 had to be separated after getting too close during the traditional staredown at 21 , @entity15 has been hyped as the @entity20 's next big thing despite only having fought five times she said : ' i think i 'm a better striker than @entity0 , a better grappler than @entity0 , i have a better submission skill set than @entity0 , i 'm stronger than @entity0 and more athletic than @entity0 so i believe i 'll be able to take the fight wherever i want to			1
' i 'm glad @entity0 has a lot of hype around her because i feel when i beat her it will make the victory that much sweeter and feel that much more rewarding and it will make people respect me more			2
' at only 21 and with just five professional fights to her name , @entity15 has enjoyed a spectacular rise since her first bout in 2012			2
after three wins and a decision defeat , she was signed by the @entity20 for the newly - formed @entity45 and initially selected to appear on the @entity46			1
but due to her being under 21 at the time , she was unable to take part and instead made her debut against @entity50 last november , stopping the 24 - year - old in the third and final round			1
' it 's very surreal , ' @entity0 said			2
' even the fact i 'm part of the @entity20 is a huge experience			0
it 's a blessing and i do n't think it will set in for a very long time			0
@entity0 admitted it feels surreal to be part of the @entity20 having made her debut aged 20 @entity15 works out in the week of her next fight , against @entity1 in @entity5 on saturday night @entity0 made a winning start to her @entity20 career , stopping @entity50 in the third round ' we were backstage at one of the other weigh - ins and someone threw it out , would you fight @entity1 and i said yeah and took the fight right away			1
' i 'm very excited about the match - up , stylistically it 's a good one for me			0
' as of right now , the only thing on my mind is winning this fight			0
i hope to win every fight the @entity20 offers me and see where this crazy journey can take me '			0
@entity15 has a realistic chance of becoming the @entity20 's youngest - ever champion			1
that record belongs to light - heavyweight @entity82 who won the title in 2011 aged 23			0
' obviously , that would be huge , and that would be awesome ; i try not to think about it and try not to focus on setting records , ' she told @entity89			0
' i strictly want to beat every opponent i face whether it 's for a title or for a small show			0
the only thing for me is winning my fights and being the best athlete i can be			0
' victory for @entity15 will take her closer to a title shot as she bids to become the youngest - ever champion			1
