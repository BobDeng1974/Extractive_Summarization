by @entity0 for @entity1 a determined soon - to - be bride finally fulfilled her lifelong dream of meeting her birth mother before walking down the aisle ; after a woman - the sister she never knew - reunited them on @entity9			1
@entity10 , 22 , now based in @entity11 , @entity12 , was born in the nearby town of @entity14 and was given up for adoption by her mother @entity16 at birth			1
@entity16 already had two children and was single , broke , unemployed and homeless at the time			0
@entity10 , who appears to hold no grudge , tells today of the moment they were reunited : ' it 's more than i could have ever dreamed it would be ... i do n't even think we said " hi "			1
we just said " i love you			0
i 've waited so long to meet you "			0
' reunited : @entity10 ( left ) always dreamed she 'd meet her birth mother , @entity28 ( right ) before she got married			1
her wish finally came true ( pictured ) when they were matched on @entity9 success : @entity10 posted this photo ( left ) to @entity9 , which was shared by hundreds of people and eventually seen by a woman who turned out to be her sister , and who sent the post to their mother ( right ) ' when , in middle school , @entity10 started looking for her birth mother , her only resource was the name of the hospital she was born in , which had no records of @entity10 even being there			1
so more recently , when a work colleague suggested posting a photo of herself on @entity9 holding a letter appealing for information - despite initially thinking it was ' dumb ' - she went ahead			1
within two days , she had a hit			0
a young woman called @entity53 had been searching for the sister she knew her mother had given up for adoption			2
she saw the post , recognized how similar the pair looked , and sent @entity59 a photo of herself and a message theorizing that they could be sisters			2
@entity63 lost sisters : @entity53 ( right ) knew her mother had given her sister ( left ) up for adoption at birth , and when she saw @entity10 's post , she noticed how similar they were and contacted her tearjerker : @entity10 ( front ) said of her first meeting with @entity16 ( back ) , ' it 's more than i could have ever dreamed it would be ... i do n't even think we said " hi "			1
we just said " i love you			0
i 've waited so long to meet you " ' attempts : @entity16 sent @entity10 ( pictured as a child ) loving letters ( left ) every year through the adoption agency , but when it closed down , the only tie she had to @entity59 was severed old times : @entity16 ( pictured as a younger woman ) was already a single mother - of - two			1
she was broke , unemployed and homeless at the time , and felt she could n't give @entity10 ( pictured at birth ) the life she deserved @entity10 recalls her instant response to seeing the photo of her sister : ' it was unbelievable ! she 's got my nose			1
she 's got my eyes			0
she 's got my features ! she 's definitely my sister			2
' ' she 's got my eyes			0
she 's got my features ! she 's definitely my sister ' in turn , @entity53 sent her mother @entity16 a photo of @entity10 , and @entity16 immediately knew ' it had to be her			1
' a few weeks later , just before @entity10 's wedding to now - husband @entity102 , the mother and daughter met in person ; a memory @entity10 says ' will last a lifetime			1
' baby joy : @entity10 ( left ) pictured with her now - husband @entity102 ( right ) , became a mother herself in february when she gave birth to baby @entity102 ( center ) , now six months old emotional : having her son made @entity10 ( right ) look at @entity16 's ( left ) decision in a different light			1
' i could never give him up like that , ' she says of @entity102 @entity16 claims she did n't know what else she could have done with her baby @entity10 in her situation at the time , but insists that she changed her mind about giving her up when she was born			2
she says she was told it was ' too late ' and a nurse took @entity10 away			2
@entity10 grew up with two adoptive brothers and was a keen sports player in school			2
she says that although she had a ' great ' childhood , she always felt there was ' something ' missing			0
this became all the more poignant for @entity10 when in february , 22 years later , she gave birth to her own child ; a now six - month - old son called @entity134			2
the motherly love she felt made her look at @entity16 's decision to give her up for adoption in a different light			0
' i could never give him up like that , ' she says of @entity134			0
' for her to do that , that 's something she 's really strong to do			0
' her own family : @entity10 ( left ) pictured at her wedding to @entity134 ( right ) with son @entity102 ( center ) , says that although she had a ' great ' childhood , she always felt there was ' something ' missing happy ending : @entity16 , pictured with @entity10 ( right ) attended the wedding and she now lives a three hour drive from @entity10			2
the pair text with each other almost every day @entity16 was one the one to hand - pick @entity10 's adoptive family			1
she says she never forgot about the daughter she gave away , and ' prayed ' for her constantly			0
she also sent @entity59 a birthday card every year through the adoption agency , as well as letters telling her how much she loved her			0
it is unclear whether any of the letters ever reached @entity10 , but the agency closed down and the only tie she had to @entity59 was severed			0
after finally being reunited all these years later , @entity16 attended the wedding and she now lives a three hour drive from @entity10			1
the pair text with each other almost every day .			0

@entity10 , 22 , posted a photo and a letter to @entity9 to try and track down her birth mother
a woman who turned out to be her *biological* sister recognized their similarities , and reunited @entity10 with their mother
@entity10 's birth mother attended her wedding soon after , and they *remain* close to this day
