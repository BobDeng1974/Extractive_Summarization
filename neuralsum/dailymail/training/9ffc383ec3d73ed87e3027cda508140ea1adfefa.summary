' i did some really stupid things without thinking , ' said @entity4			0
' it 's caused so much damage to so many people			0
there is more to me than this salacious and lurid story			0

' the original sentence was not erroneous – only the record needed to be corrected , ' deputy district attorney @entity46 wrote			1
it was not clear whether @entity18 would hand down the new sentence at monday 's hearing or sometime afterward			0
last month the judge refused a request to throw out @entity4 's conviction , but granted him a resentencing hearing , writing in her ruling that the court ' failed to state specific reasons for imposing full consecutive sentences ' as the law requires			1
@entity4 , the great - grandson of cosmetics giant @entity5 , was arrested in 2000 and charged with giving three women the drug ghb and raping them at his beachfront home while they were unconscious			1

the judge set an april 4 sentencing hearing for @entity4			0
attorneys for the @entity5 heir had argued he deserved one , in part because his original attorneys presented weak defenses at trial and that one lawyer , @entity87 , gave him ill - conceived advice to flee to @entity72			1
bounty hunter and tv star , @entity74 told @entity111 that @entity87 gave him very useful clues as to @entity4 's location			1

last month , he revealed that he was tipped off about @entity4 's location by the fugitives own attorney as @entity111 reports , @entity87 passed away in april 2011			1
the lawyer had always refuted the idea that he had given away his client 's hiding place			1
but according to ' dog ' the attorney did give him the information , in a very subtle way			0
' @entity87 became very nice to me , ' @entity74 explained to @entity111			0
' we used to tease each other			0
and at one point he said to me , " i ’m going to tell you something @entity83 , so do n’t be so dumb			0
" and then he said , " the guy ( @entity4 ) speaks @entity134			0
do you get it ? " ' the bounty hunter immediately understood			0
' i had leads that pointed to @entity138 and @entity72 , ' he said			0

' although several witnesses did describe @entity4 as ' childlike , ' it appears that this was primarily because he did not have to work at a regular job due to the fact that he had a trust fund , and he lived the life of a carefree ' beach bum , ' @entity18 wrote			0
she added that @entity4 , who spent much of his time surfing , described himself as being involved in real estate and stock trading , and that he did not appear to have a low iq			0
