two extremely rare elephant twins have been born on a game reserve in south - east @entity2			1
the unnamed babies were spotted on the @entity4 in @entity5 this week , watched over by their mother and the rest of the herd			0
less than one per cent of elephants born are twins , and the last reported set in the area born in 2006 , to a cow in @entity13			2
although the twins ’ father is no longer in the picture , @entity17 is getting plenty of help from the rest of the herd in caring for her young ones			2
@entity4 management have yet to establish the sex of the twins , as they are giving @entity17 space to nurse and feed her young ones to ensure they have the best start			0
‘ mortality of one of the twins usually occurs as the increasing demand for milk by two calves can not be met by the mother and the less dominant of the two calves usually can not gain access to its share , so this is the best start , ’ elephant specialist , dr. @entity38 , formerly of the @entity39 at @entity13 said			0
helping hands : @entity17 takes her young twins to drink alongside another elephant cow and her young camera shy : the twins hide behind their mother on the @entity4 , @entity2 time to go : the twins and @entity17 are being left alone by reserve staff so the three can bond in peace			1
