by @entity0 published : 07:18 est , 20 january 2014 updated : 08:47 est , 20 january 2014 the way police dealt with neglect allegations concerning a four - year - old boy , who was eventually starved to death by his alcoholic mother , are to be investigated			1

at her trial at @entity37 , it emerged that a range of agencies , including police officers , had contact with her family but no - one spotted the danger the children were in			0
the court also heard how @entity14 's father , @entity48 , raised concerns with officers after he was arrested for attacking @entity28 , but detectives said the claims were investigated and no problems found			1
the @entity9 said it is now investigating @entity11 ’s handling of concerns raised about @entity14 ’s welfare			2

it will also look at why the matter was not referred to the @entity9 in 2011			0
@entity9 commissioner @entity74 , who will oversee the investigation , said : ' the death of @entity14 was a truly shocking example of the most cruel neglect imaginable and at the heart of it lies the loss of a young life			2
' our investigation will examine what action @entity11 took and also why the contact was not referred to us in 2011			0
' police had extensive contact with @entity28 and her family over a number of years but mainly because she was a victim of repeated domestic violence			0
a serious case review in @entity14 's case published last year concluded that the child was ' invisible for almost a lifetime '			2

squalor : the child 's body was found in awful conditions in a bedroom at @entity28 's house @entity28 was living in what the report described as ' breathtakingly awful ' conditions with five of her young children as well as @entity14 's mummified remains when shocked police entered her four - bedroom house in september 2011			1
a jury found she had allowed @entity14 to starve to death in december 2009 and left his body in a cot with a teddy			2
