@entity1 - hour commuters might have been forgiven for thinking that the audacious armed ambush of a prison van was part of a scene for a television crime drama – but it was all too real			1
they watched in horror as a car was driven across a busy road into the side of the van , forcing it to a halt			1
three men wearing balaclavas leapt out of the car and a guard on the armoured @entity18 van was threatened with a sawn - off shotgun as the men smashed the van ’s windows with axes and sledgehammers			1
it was quickly abandoned on a side street , and two men sped off on a motorbike , while the others ran into the @entity53 council estate in @entity43			2
a witness said : ‘ i saw a dark green car with three men in it			0
i thought it was a bit strange and kept looking back to see what the car was doing			0
then i saw the car pull across the road straight into the side of the transit van and the men smashed the windscreens			1
‘ i kept walking and called the police and i could hear the smashing of screens			0
i looked back because i ’d heard some more shouts and there were some men running towards me , so i just sprinted as fast i could into the estate			0
’ last night , police were hunting @entity78 , 31 , and @entity79 , 20 , who were being taken to nearby @entity81 @entity80			1
they warned members of the public not to approach them			0
@entity27 was on trial for conspiracies to kidnap , rob , commit arson and possess a firearm			2
@entity79 was due to be sentenced after admitting conspiracy to commit robbery			0
the men were being transported from @entity92 , @entity93 ’s first privately financed prison , which is run by @entity94 , the firm behind the @entity96 security fiasco			0
one of the men had been apparently using a mobile phone to post messages on his @entity101 page in recent weeks			1
a @entity104 source said a call or a text could have been sent to alert the ambushers			1
a spokesman for @entity18 , the prisoner transport firm , said : ‘ we are liaising with @entity111			2
’ last night , a woman , 28 , and a man , 24 , were arrested on the @entity53 estate on suspicion of being involved in assisting an offender			0
they remain in police custody for questioning			0
police have warned they are ' a risk to the community ' and were dubbed the ' most wanted men in @entity93 ' as a major manhunt got underway			0
@entity28 , from @entity43 , was charged in january after a stolen @entity123 he was in was chased and cornered by police following a gangland shooting which left a 20 - year old man injured			1
on his @entity101 page @entity28 appeared to have posted pictures of himself larking about with other inmates at @entity130 and flexing his muscles for the cameras			2
eyewitnesses reported seeing a green car drive across the carriageway of the road before smashing into the side of the white van , before a group of men ran into the nearby @entity53 estate			1
one said : ‘ i crossed the road and saw a dark green car with three men in it			2
i thought it was a bit strange and walked past and kept looking back to see what the car was doing			0
looking : a police officer stands guard at the crime scene where two men escaped from a prison van in @entity43 probe : a forensic officer retrieves evidence at the crime scene where two men escaped from a prison van ‘ i then saw it pull across the road straight into the side of the transit van and ( the men ) smashed the windscreens			1
i kept walking and called the police and i could hear the smashing of screens			0
‘ i looked back because i 'd heard some more shouts and there were some men running towards me so i just sprinted as fast i could into the estate			0
i was pretty scared , to be honest			0
’ about 150 yards further along the road , on the opposite carriageway , a dark - green @entity46 had been abandoned in the road , surrounded by a police van and a police car			1
both the prison van and the @entity46 were cordoned off by police tape while officers searched the area for clues			1
a police helicopter called @entity185 99 could be seen hovering overhead			0
looking for clues : a forensic police officer takes photographs at the crime scene where two men escaped abandoned : police were searching the @entity46 car believed to have been used during the attack in @entity43 there was a huge police presence in the area around @entity43 , including police dogs , as the hunt continued for the men who it is believed have been sprung from the van			1
a @entity104 source suggested the ambush would probably involve one of the escapees having access to a smuggled mobile phone - of high value inside jail with inmates banned from having them			1
a phone call could then be made or a text sent to let the armed gang know which prison van they were in and so which vehicle to target , among the many vans making their way from jail to court			1
the ambushed van which has @entity219 was operated by prisoner escort firm @entity18 and was on its way to a court from privately - run @entity92			2
@entity92 is run by @entity94 , the firm behind the @entity96 security fiasco , and was the first designed , constructed , managed and financed private prison in the @entity93			0
the category b jail takes young offenders and adult male prisoners either sentenced or on remand from courts in @entity230 , @entity231 and @entity232 and can hold up to 1,324 prisoners			0
