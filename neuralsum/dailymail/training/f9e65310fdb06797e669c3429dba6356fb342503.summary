a high court judge has ordered two men to stay away from teenage girls in a landmark legal ruling to prevent sexual exploitation			2
it came after social services bosses in @entity7 became concerned about the welfare of a vulnerable 17 - year - old girl who is in the care of the @entity11 who was seen with the men			1
mr @entity14 granted long - term injunctions against the two men - aged 27 and 31 - after social workers and police raised concerns that the girl was at risk of sexual exploitation			1
he barred the men from approaching the girl until she turned 18 , and from approaching ' any female under 18 ' , with whom they were not personally associated , following a public hearing in the @entity28 of the @entity28 in @entity29			1
a high court judge has ordered two men to stay away from teenage girls in a landmark legal ruling to prevent sexual exploitation he is due to analyse evidence against several other men at a hearing in @entity29 on wednesday			1
a lawyer representing @entity37 told mr @entity14 bosses had launched civil court proceedings against a number of men with the aim of protecting youngsters who may not understand what was happening to them			1
@entity45 said @entity46 had supported the council 's move			0
she said the council and police had identified a ' number of individuals ' found to be ' inappropriately ' in the company of the 17 - year - old girl			1
lawyers thought that there was not enough evidence to secure criminal convictions - on a beyond reasonable doubt basis - ' at the current time '			2
mr @entity14 granted long - term injunctions against the two men - aged 27 and 31 but they thought that there was enough evidence to obtain civil court injunctions - on a balance of probabilities basis			1
miss @entity67 said if long - term injunctions were made , and any of the men were found ' in the company of a vulnerable child ' by @entity46 or @entity37 , then lawyers would ask a judge to impose jail terms for contempt of court			1
' vulnerable children and in some case adult victims have often been groomed , persuaded or threatened , ' miss @entity67 told the judge			2
' it can be difficult to empower the victims to come forward and give evidence against the perpetrators of the exploitation			0
' this case does not rely upon the victim to give evidence			0
' she added : ' @entity37 have taken this innovative legal step with the support of @entity46 to help remedy that situation and to protect vulnerable persons where they are frightened or lack understanding of what is happening to them			1
' miss @entity67 referred to investigations in ' other localities '			0
and she said there had been concerns that the only way to disrupt such ' behaviour ' was to place a child who was the focus of concern in secure local authority accommodation			2
but she said @entity37 hoped that by seeking court orders against men , ' inappropriate behaviour ' would be disrupted and victims would get the message that ' this is not down to you '			1
children 's charity the @entity113 backed the council 's approach			0
officials said social services bosses had taken a brave , if possibly controversial , step			0
' we absolutely support this move as its ultimate aim is to protect young girls who are potential sexual abuse victims , ' said @entity125 , head of the @entity113 's programmes tackling sexual abuse			0
' this is a serious child protection issue as several recent grooming cases have graphically shown and the authorities must use every weapon in their armoury to stamp it out			2
' we know that many victims do not realise they have been groomed by calculating offenders who are simply targeting them for sex and sometimes to ' sell them on ' to other abusers			0
our work in this area shows it is a sickening and insidious crime which severely damages many young lives			0
' he added : ' this is a brave step that may prove to be controversial but any measured effort to stop the foul activities of those seeking to exploit vulnerable children is to be welcomed			2
' mr @entity14 was told how police had seen the 17 - year - old girl getting out of a @entity151 containing the two men - who were aged 27 and 31 - in the early hours of the morning in early october			1
police said she had waved to the men and walked away			1
they said the car had then sped off and gone through a red light			0
miss @entity67 said police had stopped the car , arrested the men , found a half - empty vodka bottle on the back seat and a mobile phone which had been used to call the girl			1
officers had spotted the girl walking in a street a short time later			2
she had smelled of alcohol and had asked : ' what are you doing to my boys ? ' the men said they had seen the girl walking in the street in the early hours , had been concerned for her safety and had offered her a lift			1
mr @entity14 said he was satisfied that the men were ' seeking to sexually exploit ' the teenager			0
a lawyer representing @entity37 ( pictured ) told mr @entity14 how bosses had launched civil court proceedings against a number of men with the aim of protecting youngsters who may not understand what was happening to them ' the explanation that a 27 - year - old man and a 31 - year - old man pick up a 17 - year - old girl in the early hours of the morning in some way to protect her is , i am quite satisfied , culpable nonsense , ' said the judge			1
' i am satisfied , so that i am sure , that the reason why they invited ( the girl ) into their car was for nefarious purposes			0
' he added : ' i am quite satisfied given the totality of the evidence that they were seeking to sexually exploit this young vulnerable woman			0
' mr @entity14 has ruled that the 17 - year - old girl can not be identified			1
he has also ruled that the two men can not be identified			0
the judge heard that police had concerns for the ' safety and well - being ' of the men and their families			1
he was told that officers wanted to assess ' likely community reaction ' if the men 's identities were revealed in the media - and consider steps which may be required to protect them and their families			1
mr @entity14 said his ' starting point ' was that the media should not be prohibited from identifying the men			0
he said he would consider whether to allow their identities to be revealed on wednesday , after police safety assessments had been made			0
journalists at the hearing told mr @entity14 that they were concerned about such a reporting restriction being imposed			0
the judge said there was a ' high degree ' of public interest in the case - and he said he understood that concern			2
miss @entity67 told the judge that the council had run up more than £ 30,000 in legal bills			0
and she said officials wanted the men , one of whom was unemployed and one of whom worked at a newsagent 's , to each contribute around £ 2,000 towards those costs			0
lawyers for the men , one of whom was legally - aided , said neither could afford to pay .			2
