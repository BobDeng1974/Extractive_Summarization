' @entity106 , @entity107 , founder and promoter of @entity6 , told @entity110 : ' for me the best thing about @entity6 is the inclusive and communal nature of the event , which we promote above all things , and the fact that whether you own only a couple of rap albums or are a fully committed hip hop fan you can get on that stage and feel like a real rap performer for those three or four minutes			2
' if hip hop is n't your vibe but you still like to let loose on the mic , @entity123 is playing host to three of the live karaoke events – @entity130 , @entity6 and @entity131 – who are joining forces for what they call @entity135			1
