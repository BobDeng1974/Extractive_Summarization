by @entity1 reporter published : 20:04 est , 15 september 2013 updated : 07:21 est , 18 september 2013 earlier this year , the embattled head of the @entity4 sir @entity3 , pictured , implied there had been only one such payment health service bosses have spent £ 4million in just three years secretly gagging whistleblowers concerned about patient care			1
a total of 133 doctors , nurses and other staff have been quietly paid off in return for not speaking out			1
yet earlier this year , the embattled head of the @entity4 sir @entity3 implied there had been only one such payment			2
it followed revelations that @entity19 , former boss of @entity20 , was given £ 500,000 to leave quietly after repeatedly warning that targets were being put ahead of patients			1
he was made to sign a back - door deal known as a judicial mediation arrangement			1
this meant the money he was given was never declared to the @entity27 , which controls the @entity4 ’s purse strings			2
when sir @entity3 was quizzed about the gagging order by @entity31 a few weeks later , he said : ‘ it was the only one that i had ever come across			0
’ in march at a hearing of the @entity34 , he added : ‘ it is the first time in my experience i have ever seen that done			0
’ but figures obtained by @entity40 mp @entity39 sharply contradict his assertion			1
they show 41 such payments were made last year alone			1
unlike normal gagging orders , these ‘ secret ’ orders do not have to be signed off by the @entity27			0
this meant the figures did not emerge in previous revelations and the public had no way of knowing that they exist			2
however , mr @entity39 was able to obtain the data via a parliamentary question to the @entity54			2
sir @entity3 is leaving his £ 211,000 - a-year post as @entity4 chief executive next march having faced widespread criticism he failed to act over the @entity59 scandal , where hundreds of patients died from neglect			2
he also stands accused of presiding over a culture of secrecy in which managers are encouraged to gag staff daring to speak out			0
after becoming known as the ‘ man with @entity67 ’ , he faced demands from mps and medical professionals to leave immediately and forgo his £ 2million taxpayer - funded pension pot. mr @entity39 said : ‘ it appears @entity3 either did n’t know about this failure within the @entity4 which led to it wasting millions of pounds even though he is the accountable officer for this money			1
‘ the other explanation is that he did know			0
if this is the case , he ’ll need to write a letter to @entity79 explaining why he did n’t tell the truth			0
a total of 266 doctors , nurses and other staff have been quietly paid off in return for not speaking out ( posed by models ) ‘ it ’s a patient safety issue first and foremost			0
you now have 133 fewer senior people flagging concerns that may have led to discussions and possibly more money to resolve the issues			0
’ the figures show that 77 @entity4 trusts , including hospitals and gp bodies , spent £ 3.9million on judicial mediation deals for 133 staff from 2009/10 to 2012/13			1
but the @entity54 refused to disclose the size of the payments and would not name the trusts involved			0
judicial mediations are usually arranged when an employee has gone to a tribunal , for example claiming unfair dismissal			0
these figures do not include the more common gagging orders for staff who agree to leave quietly without taking legal action			1
separate data shows that the health service spent £ 15million paying off 600 staff since 2009 in payments approved by the @entity27			1
senior consultants paid up to £ 72 an hour for working evenings and weekends dr @entity120 , who raised concerns about the clinic which sent @entity123 home , said : ‘ from the top there is pressure to cut costs and meet targets			0
‘ the bullying comes from the top down			0
’ health secretary @entity132 has told @entity4 trusts not to use gagging clauses but critics said bosses will find ways round this .			1
