by @entity0 published : 00:09 est , 28 january 2014 updated : 00:33 est , 28 january 2014 multi-millionaire venture capitalist @entity2 has appeared on @entity3 to address the outrage over his comments in an op ed to the @entity7 comparing the ' progressive war on the one percent ' to the persecution of @entity10 in @entity11			1
the appearance was less an apology and more a re-assertion of his viewpoints , with some bragging about his wealth thrown in			0
@entity2 said he ' regrets ' using the word @entity20 but said he does not regret the message ' at all			1
' in danger : the ' creative one per cent ' says @entity2 , is being threatened after mentioning that he had spoken to @entity23 of the @entity24 - twice - @entity2 said that @entity20 was a ' terrible word to have chosen , ' but apparently did not regret the broader comparision of the ' demonization ' of the one per cent with @entity28			1
@entity2 said he used the word because during @entity32 , ' they broke the windows at @entity34 , they marched up to our automobile strip and broke all the windows in the luxury car dealerships			1
' he noticed police standing by watching , he said , and thought , ' well , this is how @entity20 began			2
' interviewer @entity41 questions @entity2 as to the relevance of the analogy , to which @entity2 responds : ' the @entity10 were only one per cent of the @entity45 population			1
most @entity46 had never met a @entity10			2
and yet @entity47 was able to demonize the @entity10 , ' he said			2
' my point was that when you start to use hatred against a minority , it can get out of control			1
' the creative one per cent are threatened			2
' useful : @entity54 with his ' underwater airplane ' he goes on to say that his friend and former business partner @entity58 , who fled to @entity60 to escape the @entity61 , would have agreed with him - if he was still alive			0
when asked what should be done to improve the lives of ' the 99 per cent , ' @entity2 said , ' i think that the solution is less interference , lower taxes , let the rich do what the rich do — which is get richer , and along the way they bring everybody else along with them , when the system is working			1
' bafflingly , @entity2 took the opportunity to point out that his watch - a @entity76 - ' could buy a six - pack of @entity77 ' and smugly corrected @entity78 on his ' underwater airplane			1
' the final nail in his coffin may have been when he spoke of the reason for his inflammatory letter in the first place : someone called his ex-wife romance novelist @entity85 a ' snob			0
' this offensive slight sent the self - described ' classical self - made man ' into defense mode			0
' so i thought since i 'm a knight - i 'm a literal knight of the @entity90 - i would get on my horse and charge forth in her defense , ' he told a bemused @entity78			0
' six pack of @entity77 ' : the incredibly expensive @entity76 watch - yours for the price of a family home - that @entity2 wears shining armor : @entity2 did n't appreciate his former wife @entity85 being labeled a snob - so wrote an inflammatory letter comparing the one per cent to persecuted @entity10 in @entity103 @entity2 , who repeatedly spoke of his ' message ' helpfully boiled it down to the viewer to this : ' it 's absurd to demonize the rich for doing what the rich do , which is get richer by creating opportunity for others			1
' i think the solution is less interference , lower taxes , let the rich do what the rich do			0
' the @entity120 one per center was widely ridiculed after the @entity7 published his letter comparing criticism of the super-rich to the @entity125			2
he wrote another letter sunday , this time to @entity3 , in which he compared the ' occupy ' movement to @entity130 rise to power fascism in @entity11			1
' in the @entity11 area it was racial demonization , now it is class demonization , ' wrote the @entity138 venture capital firm co-founder			0
he also expressed ' shock ' over the windows broken at luxury dealerships and banks in @entity143 while the press ' focuses its wrath on the one per cent			0
the letter was written as a @entity138 spokesperson immediately moved to distance itself from @entity2			2
' @entity2 has not been involved in @entity138 for years , ' the firm tweeted			0
' we were shocked by his views expressed today in the @entity7 and do not agree			0
' today , @entity2 suggested the firm had ' thrown him under a bus , ' and hinted that it was suffering in his absence			0
' as i ’ve distanced myself from the firm , there ’s been a corresponding decline in the firm , ' he told @entity78			0
not backing down : billionaire @entity2 clarified his saturday @entity11 reference by comparing the ' occupy ' movement to @entity130 rise to power fascism in @entity11 the second letter was written after @entity3 contacted @entity2 to clarify what he meant in his original letter to the @entity7 , according to @entity167			1
@entity2 opened his letter to the journal : ' writing from the epicenter of progressive thought , @entity143 , i would call attention to the parallels of fascist @entity11 to its war on its " one per cent , " namely its @entity10 , to the progressive war on the @entity176 one percent , namely the " rich			1
" ' mr @entity2 describing the hatred attracted by @entity179 workers in @entity143 and an incident in which his former wife author @entity85 was branded a ' snob ' in the @entity183 in a row over the height of her hedge			2
' this is a very dangerous drift in our @entity176 thinking			0
@entity20 was unthinkable in 1930 ; is its descendent " progressive " radicalism unthinkable now ? ' he continued			2
@entity20 translates as ' the night of broken glass ' and refers to coordinated attacks on @entity10 in @entity11 on november 9 1938 , as authorities looke on and did nothing			1
superyacht : mr @entity2 commissioned the $ 150m yacht @entity198 which he later sold mr @entity2 , 82 , was educated at @entity199 before gaining an mba from @entity201			1
he founded venture capitalist firm @entity138 in 1973 and has served as a director on boards of companies including @entity205			0
he recently spent $ 150 million building a super yacht called @entity198 and lives on a 60th floor , 5,500ft penthouse overlooking @entity209			1
before that , he was a general manager credited with building @entity211 into the huge company it is known as today and started a successful laser company based on his own invention			0
comparisons : mr @entity2 referenced the @entity20 attacks on @entity10 in @entity11 in 1938 protests : mr @entity2 also discusses the protests in @entity143 against @entity179 buses and tech workers driving up the area 's cost of living his comments comparing criticism of the rich to the @entity61 persecution of the @entity10 that resulted in six million deaths raised many an eyebrow			1
' the parallel of @entity11 and some people getting kind of annoyed by the tech bro dudes is exactly zero , ' @entity229 wrote on the @entity234 blog			0
author and @entity237 writer @entity236 tweeted : ' as someone who lost numerous relatives to the @entity11 gas chambers , i find statements like this revolting & inexplicable			0

@entity245 , 82 , appeared on @entity3 to address his *controversial* op ed letter to the @entity7
he compared the ' progressive war on the one per cent ' to the persecution of @entity10 in @entity11
he also likened @entity32 with @entity20
@entity2 said he ' regrets ' using the word @entity20 but is not sorry for his ' message '
' my point was that when you start to use hatred against a minority , it can get out of control , ' he said
the minority in question , one percenters , are ' threatened '
@entity2 added that we should just ' let the rich do what the rich do - get richer and create opportunities for others '
@entity2 is worth $ 8 billion and recently built a superyacht worth $ 150 million
