a high - density configuration would see @entity12 install up to 364 seats on each retrofitted plane , almost 100 more than it currently has on many of its three - class 777s , @entity10 reported			1
the @entity18 - based carrier would add a seat to every row in economy – bringing the total to ten per row – and shrink the size of its business class while leaving its premium economy class untouched with nine seats per row			1
many new @entity6 777s are being built with ten seats per row in economy class cabins passengers are pictured on board an @entity33 @entity6 which seats 10 passengers per row @entity10 spoke to an anonymous source and quoted airline documents that reveal a proposal to have 28 seats in business class , 98 in premium economy and 238 in economy on some aircraft			1
it did not say how many planes would be retrofitted , but added that many new 777s built by @entity6 have 10 seats per row in economy			2
under that configuration the middle section has four or five seats in each row while each outside section has two or three seats			2
a @entity12 spokesman declined to comment on the report			0
he told @entity56 : ‘ we evaluate lots of options across our fleet and have n’t made any further announcements specific to the 777 fleet			1
’ inside a @entity6 economy class cabin which seats nine across ; many new planes seat ten across according to @entity12 ’s website it has four versions of the @entity68			1
two versions fly between the @entity70 and @entity71 with eight seats in first class , 40 in business , 110 or 113 in economy plus , and 108 in economy for a total of 266 or 269			0
a third version seats 50 in business , 72 in premium economy , and 145 in economy ( 267 in total ) the fourth version flies to @entity83 , carrying 32 in first class , 98 in premium economy and 214 in economy ( 344 total passengers )			0
the seat pitch ( the space between seats ) on all of @entity12 ’s @entity91 is 32in while the seat width is 18in or 18.3in			0
@entity93 , travel expert at @entity95 , said if @entity12 changes its configuration to ten abreast in economy it will likely do so on routes where it does n’t have a lot of traffic in its pricier business class			2
he said : ‘ if there ’s not a lot of high - revenue business it allows ( an airline ) to obviously drive additional revenue by getting more bums in the seats in economy at a price that people are more willing to pay			0
’ he said the seat pitch is n’t likely to change when an airline goes from nine seats in a row to ten , but the seat width will shrink			2
‘ if you can cope with a narrower seat , and many people can , it probably wo n’t make a huge amount of difference			0
’ @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity33 , @entity126 and @entity127 are among the carriers which currently have ten seats per row on all or some of their @entity91			1
when an airline adds a seat to every row in economy it does n’t necessarily translate into cheaper fares for consumers , said mr @entity93 .			0

@entity10 said the configuration would see up to 364 seats installed
economy class cabin would have ten seats per row instead of nine
airline spokesman said it has no ' announcements specific to the 777 fleet '
