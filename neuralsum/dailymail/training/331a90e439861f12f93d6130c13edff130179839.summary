by @entity0 the world has wanted to develop holograms ever since princess @entity3 used it to appear before @entity5 in @entity6			2
now , more than three decades later , the hologram could be edging closer to reality with a gadget that allows you to view projected 3d images in space , from any vantage point			1
the technology , dubbed ‘ @entity18 ’ , has been created by a pair of @entity16 artists who claim to be able to project 3d objects as large as 30cm ( 12 inches )			1
this technology , however , is different			1
it has been eight years in development and is the work of @entity31 - based artists @entity32 and @entity33			1
miss @entity34 is quick to point out that the system is not actually a 3d hologram			1
pictured is the @entity40 probe @entity39 projected using the system ( left ) and a jellyfish shown on the right ' @entity6 : @entity44 – a @entity44 sparked our imaginations of what might be possible in the future by showing @entity49 and @entity50 playing a holographic chess - style game the baby is the artist 's son a few days old			1
the boy in the photos looking at the baby is the same boy now at five years old ‘ we use the term holographic to help to describe it because there is nothing else like it , it 's a device that produces 360 degree video objects , ’ she said			1
‘ it exploits persistence of vision , video projection and a number of engineering inventions			1
‘ beyond that , we ca n't really tell you much more because it 's going through a patent process			2
’ so far the system displays a number of moving objects which includes the couple ’s baby son at a few days old , a jellyfish swimming in air and the @entity82 voyager 1 probe			1
' every element of making was a huge challenge , ' they said			2
' the first version we made was quite abstract and flickered heavily , it was a bit like the very first tv , not easy to see the image but enough to see the possibilities			0
' referencing princess @entity3 ’s iconic appearance in @entity6 ( left ) as a @entity39 moving holographic message , help me @entity94 ( right ) is an investigation of remote relationships , intimacy and dislocation ' when you actually stand there with them floating in front of you they have a life that you connect to in a very different way than you would with a film or video , or even a 3d film			1
' ' this is what we mean by intimacy and dislocation , that your connection to voyager , the iconic messenger from earth , and the ideas it embodies become physical , ' the artists added			1
but they hope their technology can also be used for practical applications , such as creating 3d drawings and computer designs			1
the system is currently in its prototype stage , although the designers said they may commercialise it in the future			0
@entity129 will be on display at the @entity132 - w exhibition , through which it won an award , at the @entity135 from until august 31			1
it may have taken 36 years but the iconic holographic chess game from ' @entity44 : a @entity44 ' just took a step closer to reality thanks to a pair of augmented and virtual reality specs			0
the @entity143 system uses a pair of glasses fitted with a micro-projector on each lens that beams images in @entity39 onto a specially - designed flat surface			0
these images can then be moved and interacted with using a remote control wand			0
' @entity151 is a projected augmented reality system that displays holographic - like 3d projections right in front of you , ' said the system 's @entity157 - based maker @entity159			2
@entity151 's system is made of a pair of glasses and a surface			0
the frames of the glasses are fitted with two micro-projectors - one for each eye			0
each projector beams a perspective view of a stereoscopic @entity39 onto the retro - reflective surface			0
a tiny camera , fitted between the projectors , scans for infrared identification markers placed on this surface			0
the camera uses these markers to precisely track a player 's head position and orientation in the physical world			0
the so - called @entity179 can be used as a joystick and a ' 3d input device			2
' the handheld part of the wand has buttons , a trigger , and a thumb stick			0
the wand also tracks its own movement in 3d space , allowing players to interact with virtual environments			2
the @entity143 system uses a pair of glasses , pictured , fitted with a projector on each lens			0
each micro-projector receives a video stream via a @entity200 connection and beams these images in @entity39 onto retro - reflective sheeting			0
the images can then be moved and interacted with using a remote control wand			0

' @entity206 ' gadget can project 3d objects as large as 30cm ( 12 inches )
it was developed by @entity16 artists @entity32 and @entity33
so far the gadget can display a number of moving objects including the couple ’s son as a baby , a jellyfish swimming in air and the @entity40 probe
technology could *someday* be used for practical applications , such as creating 3d drawings and computer designs
