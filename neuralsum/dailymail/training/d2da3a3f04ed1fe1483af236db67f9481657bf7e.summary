and that 's good news for animal breeders in both countries looking to make more @entity1 - @entity10 calves			1
despite most trade with @entity1 being illegal , the @entity10 sent nearly $ 2million dollars worth of bull semen to the @entity14 nation in 2012			1

while the number seems like a lot , it 's nothing compared to the $ 26.2billion sent to our biggest trading partner - @entity29			2

others - $ 20,000 it 's not the most exported item to @entity1 , but it 's still in the top 10			1
foods like rice , lentils , chickpeas and butter top the list			0
in addition to sending food , the @entity10 sends products to help @entity1 make their own , like vegetable and fruit seeds , fertilizer and animal feed			1
the bovine semen is one part of that effort , helping to sire more cows as beef production has become an important issue in @entity1			1
the country has made it a goal to be self - sufficient in all types of meat production by 2016 , and they plan on investing the equivalent of $ 735million @entity10 dollars into the industry over the next three years according to @entity84			1
' currently , despite the great potential in the field of animal production and the creation of a number of agro-livestock farms , there are still many challenges in the industry , and some livestock enterprises operate only at 20 to 30 per cent of their production capacity , ' said @entity96 , head of the @entity97			0
