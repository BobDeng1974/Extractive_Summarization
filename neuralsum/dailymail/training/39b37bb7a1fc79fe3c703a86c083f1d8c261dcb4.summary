to go free ? the application follows a lacklustre prosecution case against @entity2 ( pictured during his trial last month lawyers for @entity2 have launched an application to have his murder trial thrown out of court , paving the way for him to fly back to @entity9 a free man			1
the application follows a lacklustre prosecution case against @entity2 which has produced little or no concrete evidence linking the 34 - year - old businessman to the honeymoon murder of his 28 - year - old wife , @entity16 , four years ago			1
the state 's case – that @entity2 recruited a taxi driver to organise the fatal shooting disguised as a carjacking in a rough township – struggled to gain traction during the testimonies of 16 witnesses following a string of successful rulings in favour of the defence			1
a central plank of the prosecution case - that @entity2 led a secret gay life that motivated him to want to be out of his new marriage - fell away on day one of his @entity35 trial last month following a dramatic admission that he was a ' bi-sexual ' who had paid gay prostitutes , frequented clubs and surfed ' hook up ' sites to satisfy his sexual urges			1
and today , defence lawyer @entity43 opened his application by slamming the state 's ' sole witness ' to @entity2 's alleged role in his wife 's murder as ' lacking in credibility '			1
taxi driver @entity51 was , according to the prosecution , recruited by @entity2 to organise hitmen to a fake carjacking as the cover for his wife 's death			1
mr @entity43 asked the judge - who will alone rule on whether to clear @entity2 - to agree that his client could not be convicted on the strength of what the driver told the court - testimony of ' such poor quality it can not be reliable , ' mr @entity43 said			2
' @entity51 is the pillar on which the state 's case is built			0
if that fails , the whole state 's case fails with it , ' he told the @entity71			0
he added that there was no doubt that there was a conspiracy targeting mrs @entity76 , but asked : ' was the accused part of this agreement ? what were the terms of this agreement ? ' the mere fact that yes , there was a hikacking , the lady was robbed ... the question is , was the accused part and parcel of this conspiracy ?			0
' this ( application ) will stand or fall with @entity51 's evidence			2
' little evidence : defence lawyers say the prosecution case has produced little or no concrete evidence linking the 34 - year - old businessman to the honeymoon murder of his 28 - year - old wife , @entity16 , four years ago ( pictured together before @entity16 's tragic death ) after dismissing @entity51 's statements to police and evidence to the court as ' riddled with contradictions ' , mr @entity43 moved on to the incredibility of the story that @entity2 had hired him to kill someone within minutes of meeting him			1
' how probable is it that this foreigner would arrive in this country and within half an hour asks him ( tongo ) to find a hitman to kill someone ? ' mr @entity43 asked the court			0
' this is one of two or three huge improbabilities - which can not be irrelevant			0
' mr @entity43 referred to @entity117 footage of the newlyweds kissing and posing for photographs at the @entity120 as they waited for @entity51 to collect them on the night mrs @entity76 was killed			0
' we ask ourselves how probable it is that this man knowing that this person he is kissing will be dead within an hour , ' he said			0
@entity2 has spent the last few days meeting his family and legal team at the high - security psychiatric hospital , where he has been held since his extradition from @entity9 in april , to agree a strategy for the end of his trial			2
in the best possible outcome for him , judge @entity133 could clear him of all charges and free to board a plane back to @entity9 within days			0
upbeat : @entity2 has spent the last few days meeting his family and legal team at the high - security psychiatric hospital , where he has been held since his extradition from @entity9 in april , to agree a strategy for the end of his trial fighting charges : @entity2 was pictured moving boxes inside the @entity143 hospital , @entity144 yesterday and appreaded also to have a pair of boxing gloves even if the judge , who sits with two assessors and no jury , does concur with the prosecution that the trial should run its course – @entity2 may still not have to face tough questioning in the witness box			1
his legal team are entitled to call no witnesses in @entity2 's defence – only give their closing argument - and the judge could still rule that there is insufficient evidence before the court on which to convict him ' beyond reasonable doubt '			1
the public gallery was packed for the unusual application brought on day 23 of the high - profile trial			0
the families of both @entity2 and his dead wife were also in court , as they have been every day of his trial			2
@entity2 looked particularly animated as his lawyer introduced five themes of arguments in support of his application			2
his eyes darted between mr @entity43 , the judge and the three benches filled with reporters .			0

application follows lacklustre prosecution that has produced little evidence
prosecutors claim @entity2 hired taxi driver to organise murder of wife @entity16
today defence team slam ' sole witness ' taxi driver as ' lacking credibility '
