the archbishop of @entity1 , the @entity2 @entity0 , pictured , has accused payday lenders of practising usury and lending money at unreasonable rates shutting down payday lenders such as @entity8 could leave society at the hands of men who ‘ send people round with baseball bats ’ , according to the archbishop of canterbury – who previously condemned the company			1
the @entity17 last week defended its decision to invest in @entity8 saying it believed its money could improve the behaviour of companies that are less than ‘ morally perfect ’			1
it came after the @entity22 announced it is considering launching a criminal investigation into the controversial payday loan firm ’s bogus legal letters sent to tens of thousands of customers			0
the archbishop of @entity1 , the @entity2 @entity0 has accused payday lenders of practising usury and lending money at unreasonable rates			1
but at a lecture in @entity30 earlier this month he warned that putting such firms out of business before an alternative is in place could make things worse by leaving poor people at the mercy of criminal loan sharks			0
‘ of course i am concerned – and this has a lot to do with the future of the @entity22 , the future of the financial services industry in this country – that if you knock payday lenders on the head before there is a viable alternative , in many parts of the country , the only place people can go is loan sharks ’ , he said			1
‘ those are the criminal lenders as opposed to the payday lenders about whom we may argue amongst ourselves , but i would argue are charging usurious rates of interest but are perfectly legal and overseen			1
‘ they do not send people round with baseball bats			0
one of the worries at the moment is if payday lending declines very rapidly and credit unions do not take up the slack , where will people turn ? there is a danger of a gap in the market			0
’ the archbishop ’s comments are the latest revelations in the turbulent relationship between the @entity17 and @entity8			2
he was previously one of the most vocal critics of payday lenders and publicly declared that he would compete @entity8 out of business with a network of church - backed credit unions			1
but in an embarrassing u-turn the @entity17 changed its stance this week when it was revealed that it will continue investing in @entity8 , after the archbishop realised that the @entity17 ’s financial arm , the @entity89 , had holdings in the firm , which are believed to amount to between £ 75,000 and £ 90,000			2
the church ’s decision came after a review by its @entity95 , the body which counsels church financiers on the morality of their investments			0
last week @entity22 watchdog the @entity101 revealed @entity8 would have to pay £ 2.6million compensation to 45,000 people sent letters from two invented debt recovery firms ( file picture ) the @entity17 commissioners are said to have calculated that they will lose between £ 3 million and £ 9 million if they take their money out of @entity8			1
and a review by its @entity95 , the body which counsels church financiers on the morality of their investments also justified its continued investment in the morally unscrupulous company			0
in the report , group chairman @entity115 said that the row had ‘ highlighted some misconceptions about ethical investment , and in particular that its objective is to achieve a morally perfect portfolio ’			2
he said : ‘ it is no more realistic to desire that they invest only in morally perfect companies than it is to desire that any of us should relate only to morally perfect individuals			1
‘ when engaging with companies the investing bodies seek positive momentum not perfection			0
we usually only recommend divestment where we see no genuine desire for change			0
’ @entity8 was publicly castigated and was forced to pay out £ 2.6m in compensation this week when it was found to have sent out letters from fake law firms to tens of thousands of customers chasing them for money			2
the @entity101 is meeting with officers from the @entity22 this week to discuss whether there is enough evidence to start a criminal investigation into the firm .			0
