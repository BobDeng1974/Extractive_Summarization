the world 's oldest primate - dating back 55 million years and small enough to fit in the palm of a hand - has been discovered by scientists			2
named @entity6 achilles and smaller than the pygmy mouse lemur , the tiniest living primate , it was unearthed near the @entity10 in central @entity11			1
even though it weighed under an ounce , the minute animal provides a vital missing link in human evolution			1
its almost complete skeleton marks a pivotal moment on the tree of life when the branch leading to modern monkeys , apes and humans split from that of the nocturnal lemur - like tarsiers of south east @entity28			1
even though it weighed under an ounce , the minute animal provides a vital missing link in human evolution researchers say the new skeleton , which is described in the journal nature , supports the more recent view that @entity28 was the continent of origin for primates , not @entity41 as previously believed			1
small eye sockets reveal it was active by day			0
paleontologist dr @entity44 , who led the research , said : ' this region would have been a large series of lakes , surrounded by lush tropical forests during the early @entity50			0
' our analysis shows this new primate was very small and would have weighed less than an ounce			2
' it had slender limbs and a long tail , would have been an excellent arboreal leaper , active during the daytime , and mainly fed on insects			0
' closest living relatives : the tarsier ( @entity63 ) is considered endangered and only found on islands in @entity28 ; the pygmy mouse lemur is the tiniest living primate and is found on the island of @entity68 tree - dwelling @entity6 would use its chimpanzee - like opposable big toe to cling onto the branches			1
dr @entity72 , of the @entity73 in @entity74 , said : ' @entity6 differs radically from any other primate , living or fossil , known to science			2

an artistic reconstruction of @entity6 in its natural habitat of trees in central @entity11 dr @entity72 , of the @entity73 in @entity74 , said : ' @entity6 differs radically from any other primate , living or fossil , known to science			1
' @entity6 differs radically from any other primate , living or fossil , known to science and represents a big step forward in our efforts to chart the course of the earliest phases of primate and human evolution ' dr @entity72 ' it looks like an odd hybrid with the feet of a small monkey , the arms , legs and teeth of a very primitive primate , and a primitive skull bearing surprisingly small eyes			1
' it will force us to rewrite how the anthropoid lineage evolved			0
' the skeleton was digitally reconstructed using state of the art scanning techniques , allowing to establish the fossil was radically different from any other primate , living or extinct			0
anthropologist dr @entity117 , of @entity118 , said : ' this is the oldest primate skeleton of this quality and completeness ever discovered and one of the most primitive primate fossils ever documented			1
' the origin of primates sets the first milestone for all primate lineages , including that of humanity			2
' although scientists have found primate teeth , jaws , occasionally skulls or a few limb bones from this time period , none of this evidence is as complete as this new skeleton from @entity11			1
' with completeness comes more information and better evidence for the adaptive and evolutionary themes concerning primate evolution			2
it takes guessing out of the game			0
' dr ni , of the @entity147 in @entity148 , first came across the fossil years ago while doing fieldwork			0
it had been found by a local farmer and was later donated to the university			0
it was encased within a rock that was split open to reveal fossils and impressions of the primate on each side of the two halves			2
the quarry where it was discovered was once a lake where many ancient fish and bird fossils from the same era known geologically as the @entity50 have been dug up			0
dr @entity44 said : ' @entity6 marks the first time we have a reasonably complete picture of a primate close to the divergence between tarsiers and anthropoids ( primates that include monkeys , apes and humans )			1
' it represents a big step forward in our efforts to chart the course of the earliest phases of primate and human evolution			1
' their study included a three dimensional , high resolution reconstruction , aided by high tech scanning of the fossil at the @entity190 in @entity191 , @entity192 .			0

*archicebus* achilles was found near the @entity10 in @entity11
@entity196 marks pivotal moment in human evolution
' one of the most primitive primate fossils ever documented '
discovery supports view that primates originated in @entity28 , not @entity41
