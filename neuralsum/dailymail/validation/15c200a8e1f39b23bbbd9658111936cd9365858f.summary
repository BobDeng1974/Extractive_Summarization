now it ’s not often that i can claim to be ahead of a fashion trend			0
but a few weeks ago i was invited to a photoshoot to give my verdict on a new range of suede clothing — apparently , the must - have fabric this season , as we experience a @entity11 revival			1
as someone who remembers the @entity11 all too clearly , and who boldly wore some of its more questionable offerings the first time round , i was interested to see how i felt about it now			0
i did n’t know i was about to try out a garment that has since fuelled a major fashion debate and divided @entity21 ’s women , who , it seems , all have an opinion on that skirt , as it is now known			1
’ yet when i spotted it a few weeks ago , it was just one of several suede garments hanging on a rail , so i had the chance to judge it in an unbiased and objective way			1
i did n’t much like it			0
i found the suede stiff and heavy , and the colour and shape channelled the @entity11 cowgirl look a little too closely for comfort			1
some fashions are best left unrevisited and this length and shape of suede skirt seemed one of them			1
soon after that , all hell broke loose as various fashionistas were spotted wearing the skirt			1
it was photographed on the lithe and youthful hips of people who know a lot more about fashion than me — first @entity69 , then socialite @entity70 at @entity71 , both of whom obviously liked it enough to happily endorse it			1
@entity76 heralded it ‘ pure @entity84 chic ’ in reference to the star of the @entity11 film @entity81 , and suddenly it was the next big thing			0
@entity69 ( pictured ) was spotted in the @entity39 skirt in february this year well , i can be as easily influenced as anyone , and a horrible guilt crept over me that i had n’t spotted this as the wonder garment everyone else had			1
i wondered : should i rush out and grab one from @entity39 ? well , not much point , as it wo n’t be on sale to us ordinary punters until april 10			1
so , should i trust my first feeling that it was n’t for me ? after a bit of thought , i came full circle back to my original decision : i ’m still not a fan			0
yesterday , @entity104 columnist @entity103 was one of the first to shout ‘ @entity105 ! ’ when she criticised @entity39 for its aggressive marketing of the skirt , which , she felt — correctly in my view — seemed to use a lot of energy that could have been better focused on producing affordable fashion that does n’t follow any trend			1
‘ just because a couple of @entity116 have given it their stamp of approval , we loyal @entity39 customers are meant to flock like good little style sheep to get our hands on one , too , ’ she said			1
‘ ca n’t @entity39 see how patronising this is ? ’ for this suede skirt did n’t work in the @entity11 and it does n’t really work now			1
when i was young , most suede skirts and jackets were stiff , unyielding garments produced in a gingery tan colour that did n’t flatter anyone — especially those of us with gingery , tan - coloured hair — and it often felt like wearing thick cardboard			2
sadly , this reincarnation gave me flashbacks			0
the unsuppleness and heavy feel of the suede may mean it will last for ages , but you ’ll know about it while you ’re wearing it : the waistband is far from forgiving and i ca n’t imagine it will give much across the hips when you sit down , making it stick out unattractively in front			2
i ’m not crazy about the mid-calf length , either			0
unless you have the endless legs of a model , it ’s hard to carry off			0
it would look better with boots , of course , but with spring already here i ’m hoping those can be left in the wardrobe			0
and i ca n’t see how the white stitching on hips and tummy can be flattering			0
sorry , @entity39 , i ’m giving it just three out of five : wearable for a few outings , after which it would be confined to the back of my wardrobe , never to be worn again			1
a costly foray into a brief trend — something that , at my age , i have mostly learned to avoid			0
@entity165 @entity27 ( pictured ) loved this flattering suede dress from @entity167 , finding the whole outfit comfortable and well fitting , without the stiffness of some other suede garments wraparound suede dress , £ 199.99 , hm.com suede block - heeled sandals , £ 129 , reiss.com @entity174 , £ 39 , reiss.com @entity176 diamond ring , £ 210 , monicavinader.com my favourite : it ’s an excellent price and a beautiful and flattering berry colour , which suits most skin tones			1
the suede is wonderfully supple and comfortable and fits well			2
it certainly does n’t have the stiffness that some other suede garments have , and the just - above - the - knee length is elegant and suits the shape of the dress			2
who would have thought i ’d want to be back in a wrap dress again ? i thought we were over those for some time			0
the fabric updates this classic look			0
i love it — especially the great price			0
5/5 should you fake it ? the suede culottes @entity27 is sporting here did not get a good review with the stiff fabric and odd shape granting them a paltry 2/5 @entity204 top , £ 129 , baukjen.com @entity206 culottes , £ 24.99 , hm.com heels , £ 225 , russellandbromley.co.uk no ! no ! no ! culottes tend to look stiff and oddly shaped unless they ’re made in a fluid fabric			1
these certainly do n’t suit me , and i ’m proving that here beyond any reasonable doubt			0
they cut off my legs at the least flattering part , the calves , and look more dickensian urchin than fashion - forward fabulous			0
the faux fabric does feel like the real thing , but i suspect that it might crease			0
if i wanted some suede trousers i ’d save up for a better design			1
2/5 @entity222 and @entity223 @entity27 ( pictured ) says this suede top may be worth the £ 249 you 'd have to shell out to buy it			1
she found the item ' extremely chic and wearable ' , saying it would work with tight jeans or a smart skirt suede top , £ 249 , baukjen.com @entity233 jeans , £ 180 , trilogystores.co.uk heels , £ 5 , everything5pounds.com @entity236 necklace , £ 85 , stelladot.co.uk deceptively simple , this little suede top just might be a really good investment as it ’s extremely chic and wearable , whether teamed with tight brand jeans or a smart skirt			1
i love the boxy on - trend cut and the sleeve length makes it suitable for any occasion , as well as being long enough to keep the spring chill off and hide any imperfections			0
this suede is so thin and soft it feels like silk , and i like the tunic slit at the top			2
4/5 make a splash another top scorer was this lilac suede dress			2
@entity27 ( pictured ) says it fits beautifully , skimming fluidly over the body , with the colour adding to the classy look suede dress , £ 429 , baukjen.com blue necklace , £ 50 , stelladot.co.uk suede strappy sandals , £ 250 , lkbennett.com this fits so beautifully and skims fluidly over the body			1
yes , it costs a lot , but it really does look expensive and the lilac is stunning and classy			2
the suede has an almost silky feel			2
i adored wearing this , but the danger of ruining it with smudges would make me wary of splashing out the serious cash			0
remember that suede needs a lot more care than leather , tending to show rain spots and stains easily , and the soft top layer can wear off after a lot of use			2
it may be worth protecting expensive suede garments with a special spray , and they will also need expert cleaning			0

the *a-line* , suede skirt has had people talking all week , with mixed reviews
it has been also *touted* as the item that will ' save ' @entity39 and costs £ 199
