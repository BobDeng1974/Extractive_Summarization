by @entity0 published : 14:52 est , 26 april 2013 updated : 15:48 est , 26 april 2013 under fire : more than 1,000 women are suing the makers of contraceptive device @entity4 , claiming that it ' causes blood clots ' over 1,000 nuvaring users have filed lawsuits against @entity9 , the pharmaceutical company that manufactures the contraceptive device , alleging that it has caused them to suffer blood clots			1
the plaintiffs have taken their cases to a federal district court in @entity16 , and are claiming that the company did not adequately test or label the device before it hit the market in 2002			1
the particular way the rings deliver hormones to the body plays a part in their risk factor , say the plaintiffs			0
unlike other methods of contraceptive , @entity4 emits hormones directly into the bloodstream			1
expert witnesses for the lawsuits say that the hormone ' spikes ' that women experience when using the device may make them more susceptible to blood clots			1
there are currently no studies to support or refute this claim			0
@entity40 , a former @entity4 user , told @entity41 that she began using the device in 2008 because it was more convenient than other birth control methods			0
she cited the fact that the ring requires less discipline than a once - a - day - pill , since it is inserted into the vagina and removed once a month			2
in 2010 , mrs @entity40 , who was 22 at the time , was out to lunch with her father when she suddenly fell ill outside the restaurant and ' spat up quarter - size chunks of blood onto the cement '			2
as a young , healthy non-smoker , the @entity58 , @entity57 resident did not fit the profile of someone susceptible to blood clots			1
for ten days , doctors at a hospital administered anticoagulants to thin her blood as they tried to determine the health issue			0
finally , they agreed that her @entity4 was responsible for putting her at risk to blood clots			1
now , mrs @entity40 and more than 1,000 other women are suing @entity9 for claims that it has caused them to suffer blood clots ; in some of the cases , the clots were fatal			1
but studies looking at the risks of the device have obtained contradicting results			2
@entity4 stops ovulation by releasing a combination of the hormones estrogen and progestin into the body			0
dozens of studies - including a recent one funded by the @entity89 - have found that women taking contraceptives like @entity4 , which contains a third - generation progestin , are 1.4 to four times more likely to develop blood clots than those taking contraceptives with second - generation progestin			1
the study , which examined the health histories of over 835,000 women , revealed that those who used a vaginal ring like @entity4 were more at risk for venous thrombosis - a blood clot that forms in a vein - than those who use oral contraceptives			1
the @entity4 , which first hit @entity109 markets in 2002 , is a small , flexible ring made of transparent plastic			0
when inserted into the vagina , it releases the hormones estrogen and progestin into the blood stream , preventing ovulation			2
the most common side effects according to @entity117 are headache , weight gain , nausea , breast irritation , and vaginal irritation			0
a website for the device warns women not to use it if they are pregnant , smokers , or have a history of blood clots			1
@entity129 estimates the number of @entity4 users at over 1million worldwide			0
other experts , however , have asserted that there is no increased risk at all associated with these hormonal contraceptives			0
indeed , some claim that the allegations against contraceptive methods have done more harm than good , since they have frightened women out of taking birth control precautions altogether			0
a group of more than 20 researchers published a letter in the @entity145 and @entity146 this month , claiming that studies opposing these contraceptive devices do n't take into account certain variables , like obesity , which is a main risk factor leading to blood clots			2
so far , the cases against @entity4 have not held up in court			0
last week , a @entity157 judge threw out seven suits against @entity4 , explaining that the women did not sufficiently prove that the devices were the cause of their blood clots			1
and even though mrs @entity40 and her fellow plaintiffs claim that @entity9 did not adequately test the device before it hit shelves , executives at the company have maintained that their product is an effective and safe method of birth control			1
@entity171 , a spokeswoman for @entity9 , said in a statement : ' we are confident the company has provided appropriate and timely information about @entity4 to consumers and the medical , scientific and regulatory communities			2
' many of the cases against @entity9 will face trial in the federal court system starting this october .			0

women claim the vaginal ring - which emits hormones directly into the bloodstream - has caused them to suffer *potentially* fatal blood clots
they also allege that @entity9 , the company that manufactures the device , did not adequately test or label it to warn users of its risks
