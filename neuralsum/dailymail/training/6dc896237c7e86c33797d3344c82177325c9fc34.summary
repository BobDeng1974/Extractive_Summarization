two major @entity1 air carriers are being at risk of hefty fines after their customers were stranded for seven hours as runways turned into a ski slope over the weekend			1
it was a nightmare near @entity8 , @entity9 , as passengers on six @entity12 planes and one @entity14 plane say they were stranded on the tarmac at @entity16 for seven hours or more			1
they were being diverted from @entity18 - area airports on saturday - and the ordeal continued after they were let off and had to spend the night on beds and chairs in terminals			2
@entity29 had made conditions difficult under the so - called tarmac delay rules put in place last year , both airlines , could be slapped with a fine of $ 27,000 per passenger , @entity31 reported , a whopping $ 18,900,000 for @entity12 alone			1
a passenger on one of the diverted @entity12 planes says the crew ran out of snacks and bottled water for the last few hours of the delay			1
‘ the toilets were backed up , ’ said @entity45 newspaper reporter @entity44 , who was traveling to cover the @entity46 against the @entity47			1
‘ when you flushed , nothing would happen			0
’ his plane took off from @entity52 for @entity53 at around 9am			0
after being diverted to @entity8 , the plane sat on the tarmac between around 1:30pm and 9pm , he said			1
a @entity12 spokesman said six of its planes , carrying a total of about 700 passengers , were diverted to @entity8 as a result of a ‘ confluence of events ’			1
these included equipment failures at @entity53 and @entity18 's @entity67 that prevented planes from landing in low visibility			2
the @entity12 spokesman declined to specify how long the planes sat on the tarmac at @entity16 , but noted that 17 other flights with different carriers were also diverted to the airport			1
frustrated : passengers were left without food , water or working bathrooms and journalist @entity44 , pictured second row on right with his head turned , tweeted his annoyance once the planes landed at @entity16 , the @entity12 spokesman said that intermittent power outages at the airport made refuelling and deplaning difficult			1
@entity87 , of @entity88 , said she got calls and emails from passengers and worried family members regarding at least four flights that were stranded on the tarmac for up to 10 hours			2
' the toilets were backed up			0
when you flushed , nothing would happen ' @entity44 @entity98 and his wife were on one of those planes , an @entity14 flight that had originally been headed to @entity67 after taking off from @entity104 airport in @entity105			1
after being diverted and landing in @entity8 at 2:30pm , mr @entity98 said passengers were given various reasons for being held on the tarmac			2
these included the need to refuel and de-ice and the airport 's limited capacity for handling international flights			0
he and his wife were eager to get back home to their two young sons in @entity118 , @entity119			0
but they realised they did n't have it as bad as the parents who had infants on the plane			0
@entity126 vented : mr @entity44 , a reporter with the @entity127 on the flight to cover a football game in @entity130 , kept his followers updated while on board ‘ there was a lady in front of us with an 18 - month - old daughter , ’ mr @entity98 said			1
‘ another woman came by to borrow diapers because we could n't get to our luggage			0
’ ' there was a lady in front of us with an 18 - month - old daughter			0
another woman came by to borrow diapers because we could n't get to our luggage ' @entity98 after spending the night at the airport , mr @entity98 was lucky to find two seats on sunday on an afternoon flight home to @entity150			2
but the headache is not over yet as his luggage was headed to @entity67 because the @entity8 airport crew was n't able to handle international luggage , mr @entity98 said			0
an @entity14 spokesman said the passengers were n't allowed off the plane by customs at the airport			2
in a recording obtained by liveatc.net , the pilot on the @entity12 flight from @entity52 was forced to call for police back - up when passengers grew hostile			1
he said : ' i got a problem here on the airplane , i 'm gon na need to have the cops on board			0
there 's a cop car sitting in front of me right here right now			0
' i need some air stairs brought over here and the cops brought onboard the airplane			0
' passengers : mr @entity44 , left , was exhausted after the ordeal , while a passenger who would only identify himself as @entity180 , right , said he was furious @entity181 , who was on a @entity12 flight from @entity183 to @entity67 , said his plane was diverted to @entity16 and sat on the tarmac for seven hours			1
the crew picked up rubbish regularly and handed out water and snacks and ‘ everyone held their cool , ’ he said			0
but his frustrations grew with each status update - as the reasons for the delay kept changing as the hours passed			1
' i got a problem here on the airplane , i 'm gon na need to have the cops on board			0
there 's a cop car sitting in front of me right here right now			0
i need some air stairs brought over here and the cops brought onboard the airplane ' pilot on @entity52 plane early on , passengers were told that the plane was just being refuelled and would fly out soon , he said			2
then they were told it was being de-iced			0
then there was an emergency on another plane			0
‘ we were told we were the third plane in line to get to the gate when we landed , ’ he said			2
‘ then we stayed on the plane for seven hours			0
’ mr @entity44 of the @entity127 newspaper in @entity45 , who was on another @entity12 flight , reported a similar sequence of updates			1
' lady on board just broke down , ' he tweeted at one point			0
' like that guy who cried in his cell at the beginning of @entity234			0
can someone sneak me in @entity237 ? ' the saga continued long after passengers were let off the plane			0
the power outages from storms in @entity9 made booking hotel rooms difficult			2
as a result , many passengers just slept at the airport , mr @entity44 and mr @entity181 said separately			2
help required : passengers on board dialled 911 after hours of being told they could n't leave			1
fire and police crews arrived when they awoke , hundreds of passengers had to wait in line for hours just to figure out which flight they would be on			1
‘ that was most disappointing part , ’ mr @entity44 said			0
‘ it seemed like there was no plan when we got off the plane			0
’ in the morning , mr @entity44 said he and several other passengers rented a van to drive to @entity130 rather than wait for the afternoon flight @entity12 had scheduled to @entity53			1
it 's not the first time @entity12 has had problems with tarmac delays			2
the @entity18 - based airline also made headlines in 2007 when snow and ice storms stranded its planes for nearly 11 hours at @entity18 's @entity67			1
such high - profile delays helped prompt a regulation last year that fines airlines for holding domestic flights on the tarmac for more than three hours			1
this year , the rule was extended to apply to international flights that are held on the tarmac for more than four hours			0
still delays : stranded passengers rested on cots at @entity16 , a day after the snowstorm in @entity287 , @entity9 , forced them to stay on board the plane however the @entity290 often does n't enforce the fines to their full extent unless delays are extreme			1
passengers also do not get a cut of the fines			2
low - cost carriers are more prone to tarmac delays because letting passengers off planes can cost an airline a lot of money , said ms @entity87 of @entity88			1
if a plane is diverted because of a reason within the airline 's control , such as a mechanical failure , ticket contracts usually state that passengers will be reimbursed for hotels , food and transportation			1
that means airlines do everything in their power to keep passengers on board in hope that the plane will be able to take off again			2
@entity12 said that passengers who were diverted to @entity16 would be reimbursed for their fares and hotel expenses			1
a spokesman for the @entity325 & @entity130 , which oversees @entity53 and @entity67 airports , could not say how many flights were diverted because of equipment failures .			0

@entity12 could be hit with more than $ *18,000,000* in fines .
