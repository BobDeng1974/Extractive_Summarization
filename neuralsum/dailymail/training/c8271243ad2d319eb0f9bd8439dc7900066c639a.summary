cyclists and motorists are well known for their mutual dislike of each other , with both parties accusing the other of hogging the road			0
and this unfortunate @entity8 driver certainly has n't helped relations			1
cyclists were stunned to see the motorist driving his car on a narrow cycle bridge over a railway line			1
tight spot ! the unfortunate driver kept apologising and telling cyclists he had made a terrible mistake cyclists watched in disbelief as the motorist drove his car over the £ 2m bridge reserved for pedestrians and cyclists in @entity24 they heard the £ 2 million bridge ' creaking and cracking ' as the driver squeezed onto the famous covered bike bridge in @entity24 city centre			1
the man , who was in his late 50s , eventually realised his mistake , profusely apologised , and reversed all the way back down the bridge at the north end of @entity24 station			1
cyclist @entity35 , 43 , did a double - take when she spotted the driver on the way home from her yoga class			0
she cycled past him , then went back and asked him if he knew what he was doing			0
' a lot of cyclists were giving him a really hard time , but he kept saying he was really sorry and had made a terrible mistake , ' said mrs @entity35 , who photographed the car			1
' i could hear a bit of creaking and cracking , so i hope the engineers made the bridge strong enough for a car , as it 's much heavier than a bike			2
' he was n't trying to take a short cut , he really had made a big mistake and i actually felt quite sorry for him			2
' after realising his mistake , the motorist reversed - but not in time to stop the bridge groaning under the weight of the car the bridge was built 23 years ago and has a red path for cyclists on the left and a slightly raised one for pedestrians on the right			1
it was designed to be a quick and safe off main - roads - route from the city centre to the south - eastern suburbs of the city for cyclists , so they could avoid cars			0
the bridge was given a £ 500,000 face lift seven years ago , when the floor was replaced			1
councillor @entity79 , from the city council , said : ' i think he needs to get his eyes tested			0
' how someone can mistake what is clearly a narrow cycle path and footbridge for a road bridge is beyond my imagination			2
' i have never heard of this happening before and the bridge has been there for more than 20 years			0
' if he had got to the end of the bridge he would have got stuck as the path gets even more narrow and there are bollards to stop cars			0
' a view of the cycle path from the end of the bridge where it is believed the driver entered			0
