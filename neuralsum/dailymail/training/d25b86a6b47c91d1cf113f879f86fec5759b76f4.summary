there was a definite air of concern			0
' for the first time they talked about the possibility of him not surviving birth			0

it is so rare , ms @entity34 said she is only aware of one other case in @entity132			0
' i got a second opinion , and the most conclusive observation was that @entity37 was going to be short			0

i wanted to do everything i could			0

' a doctor explained @entity37 was n’t breathing properly and needed to be taken away for urgent treatment			2
i felt numb - we did n’t know if he was going to make it			1
' after two hours i was able to see him in the high - dependency ward			2
' at a later scan they realised that his cranium had healed at the back but the top was open , leaving him with an odd - shaped head			2

' i felt instant love			1

it affects everything - from his mobility to his breathing			1
' i do n’t know of any other child in the country who has it			2

' ms @entity34 attends appointments with @entity37 every three months for checks and is observant for any worrying changes			0
she said : ' i do n’t know if @entity37 ’ condition will damage his brain or is life - limiting , which is why it ’s important that we enjoy every day together as much as we can			1
he ’s been through so much in his life already			2
' he ’s the happiest child you can imagine			2
he ’s very affectionate and sociable , and brings a lot of joy to my life			2
@entity37 , pictured shortly after he was born , had a series of life - saving operations in his first few months , having a shunt fitted in his brain to drain fluid , a feeding tube inserted and two head expansion operations ' i do n’t have any regrets about having him			1
sometimes people do n’t realise how different my life is now - going out without @entity37 takes a lot of planning			1
but i do n’t regret having him for a moment			0
i knew i made the right decision not to have a termination			0
' ms @entity34 now volunteers at @entity241 to support and advise families with children facing disabilities or major surgery			1
she said : ' when expectant parents are facing tough choices , what they usually hear are people - friends and family - telling them that they should n’t burden themselves with disabled children			1
' but that ’s not the way to look at life			2
you could have a perfectly healthy child and , heaven forbid , there could be illness or an accident			0
' would i have been comfortable knowing that i got rid of @entity37 without giving him a chance ? no. that ’s how i know i made the right choice			0
' i encouraged two parents to let their children have tracheostomies			0
they were terrified , but showed them @entity37 and how , despite his challenges , he ’s fine			0
' having a community of people around you makes that kind of journey a bit easier			0
it ’s easier to talk to parents about the challenges than nurses			0
' ms @entity34 has found support from @entity241 and @entity284 respite services			2
