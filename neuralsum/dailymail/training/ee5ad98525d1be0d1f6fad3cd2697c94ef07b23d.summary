@entity1 ’s dream of going to @entity2 for a mega-fight farewell to the ring is now within touching distance of reality , with @entity8 promoter @entity7 asserting serious interest in the @entity10 facing @entity11 in @entity12			1
such a fight would gross at least $ 50million , from pay - per - view tv on both sides of the @entity16 as well as live gate receipts at the @entity18			0
that is likely to be the clinching incentive for @entity1 to fight again , which he has suggested he might only do if the next one is a big night in the fight capital of the world			1
’ @entity43 is @entity1 ’s preferred option , even over a re-match with @entity46 , the only one of the world ’s elite super-middleweights he has yet to beat			2
as the namesake son of @entity43 the legendary @entity51 , @entity49 would galvanise the @entity53 boxing market with @entity1 appealing across the board to the @entity8 majority			2
@entity7 , @entity57 promoter of @entity43 as well as @entity58 , predicted victory for the @entity10 over @entity60 and has already opened discussions with the @entity42 network about @entity43 being pay - per - view over there , as well as on @entity65 here			1
@entity43 has recently scored a convincing win in a re-match with the highly - rated @entity68 , having made the super-middleweight 12 - stone limit comfortably for the first time of late to suggest that his recent struggle with drink and drug abuse is now behind him			0
and he has been quick to say : ‘ a fight with @entity1 would be huge			1
i am already looking forward to it happening			0
’ the projected date is early to mid-november just in case it does n’t happen , @entity78 has jostled nearer the front of what promoter @entity81 calls ‘ the orderly queue ’ of current and former world champions eager to cash in on the box - off magic of @entity1			1
the @entity86 remains behind @entity11 in that line but as he flew home from @entity30 to @entity89 he improved his chances by offering to come back to @entity91 for a third battle with @entity1			1
@entity78 makes that move even though he lost to the @entity10 at the @entity94 , having beaten @entity1 in his home town of @entity96			1
up next ? @entity1 has targeted a fight with @entity98 ( left ) in @entity2 later this year winning : @entity11 celebrates his victory over @entity100 in @entity101 last march having watched @entity1 cement his legacy in the hardest game , @entity78 said : ‘ i would love to box @entity39 again and if it means i have to come back to @entity105 , i will do it			1
it would be fantastic to be part of something like the amazing show they put on at @entity30 on saturday night			2
’ @entity78 knows his only hope of procuring the third fight in what would be a classic ring trilogy is to yield home advantage			1
that means either @entity105 - or possibly @entity2 if it were to be thought that two @entity119 fighters could fill the @entity18 and sell at least half a million pay - per - view buys on @entity42			2
@entity78 , who is coming back unexpectedly after announcing his retirement following his defeat by @entity1 , says : ‘ i ’m only returning for the big fights			1
it is 1 - 1 between me and @entity39 and i would return to @entity105			0
we could fight in front of 40,000 in @entity127 and that would be easier for me			0
it is an advantage when you fight at home			0
but i know i would get a fair shake in @entity91			0
first time : @entity78 beat @entity1 on points in their first brutal battle in @entity89 four years ago revenge : @entity1 levelled the scores with an inspired victory at the @entity138 in @entity105 last year ‘ a real champion travels overseas , unlike @entity46 who hardly ever boxes outside @entity142			1
’ @entity46 ’s lack of box office appeal is against him , while it has to be uncertain if a world title unification match between @entity1 and @entity146 , who took his @entity149 belt to @entity30 to show the @entity10 , would be a draw in @entity2			1
as for @entity29 , the road back could begin with a tough return against @entity153 … if his fellow @entity154 can forgive him for persistently rejecting a re-match after their close first fight			1
that punch which reverberated from @entity30 around the world is finally getting @entity1 the global recognition he so richly deserves			1
ring magazine , the bible of boxing in the @entity8 , joins me in listing @entity1 in their top ten pound - for - pound fighters in the world , albeit a couple of places lower			2
@entity1 ’s knockout of @entity29 – as spectacular as the @entity30 setting – is the most recent in a cluster of fights which demand a reshuffle of my rankings			1
imperious : @entity178 ( left ) remains at the top of the pound - for - pound list still got it : @entity58 beat @entity182 in april to avenge the defeat he suffered in 2012 @entity58 ’s brilliant avenging of that nonsensical defeat by @entity182 – revenge mostly over the blinkered judges - reaffirms my consistent placing of the @entity58 as no 2 behind @entity178			0
@entity46 , down two , was third in my previous list and second to @entity178 in most other ratings			0
@entity46 is a brilliant technician but @entity1 is catching up with a man whose inactivity counts increasingly heavily against him , as well as his refusal to fight anywhere outside @entity38			2
the @entity46 , as he characterises himself , remains the @entity198 super super-middleweight champion , with @entity1 holding the so - called ‘ regular ’ belt below that as well as the full @entity202 world title			2
schooled : @entity46 ( right ) beat @entity1 in 2011 but has struggled for exposure since then 1 ) @entity178 ( unchanged ) 2 ) @entity58 ( unchanged ) 3 ) @entity204 ( up 2 ) 4 ) @entity205 ( up 2 ) 5 ) @entity46 ( down 2 ) 6 ) @entity206 ( up 2 ) 7 ) @entity207 ( up 2 ) 8 ) @entity1 ( up 2 ) 9 ) @entity182 ( down 5 ) 10 ) @entity208 ( down 3 ) but he has only fought twice since outpointing @entity1 in the final of the @entity211 tournament in december 2011			2
once against @entity213 , a light - heavyweight obliged to drain himself down to 12 stone for the money , and most recently in november in what became a non-title fight because opponent @entity212 failed to make the weight			2
in contrast , @entity1 has fought five times since his off - night against @entity46 in @entity222			0
he immediately regained world champion status by blitzing @entity224 , then easily won the only ‘ gim me ’ in his remarkable sequence of 12 consecutive world title fights which has gone on now to include famous victories over @entity78 and , twice , @entity29			1
so in our pound - for - pound listing @entity1 climbs to eighth , @entity46 falls to fifth			0
both @entity204 , by virtue of his seemingly everlasting heavyweight domination , and @entity205 , who gets the proper recognition here for his purist @entity236 brilliance which he is denied by so many thrill - seekers in @entity38 , both rise above @entity46			0
@entity182 , who ascended to fourth after cleverly out - pointing @entity207 , slips to ninth while that @entity51 icon moves up			0
top class : @entity205 ( left ) and @entity204 remain among the best boxers in the world @entity208 eases to tenth , @entity1 ’s preceding spot , while we wait for his agreement to face brutal puncher @entity248			0
@entity206 , the brilliantly skilled @entity249 , is still in the mix but will have to beat @entity251 in saturday ’s @entity253 blockbuster – live in @entity254 on @entity255 – to stay at sixth			0
the unluckiest losers this time are @entity259 flyweight sensation @entity258 , who has landed 31 knockouts in his perfect 37 win record but whose opponents are difficult to assess down in the minimal light - flyweight division , and @entity264 , who needs a top middleweight against whom to verify his apparently phenomenal punching power			0
* @entity268 – 1 ) @entity178 ; 2 ) @entity46 ; 3 ) @entity269 ; 4 ) @entity270 ; 5 ) @entity182 ; 6 ) @entity207 ; 7 ) @entity206 ; 8 ) @entity205 ; 9 ) @entity271 ; 10 ) @entity1 .			0

@entity98 *'s* promoter confirms he could fight @entity1
fight would take place in @entity2 , probably in november
@entity78 , @entity153 and @entity146 are other options for @entity1
