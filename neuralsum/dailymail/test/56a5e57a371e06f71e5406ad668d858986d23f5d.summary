the poll is a blow to mr @entity5 on the day he used @entity7 's manifesto launch to insist he is ' ready ' to be prime minister but @entity7 and the @entity2 have clashed on ms @entity8 's call for full fiscal autonomy for @entity1 , and her suggestion that another referendum could be held before 2020			1

not only has @entity7 's hopes of a recovery in support been dashed but , even worse , it appears to have gone backwards			0
' the @entity2 seems to be building on the momentum which they carried forward from the independence referendum , while @entity71 is still struggling to win back @entity7 's lost supporters			2
indeed , the latest poll shows some evidence that the growth in @entity2 support is mainly coming from disaffected @entity7 supporters			2
' but it 's important to remember that the campaign is really only beginning and 29 per cent of those who say they are certain to vote have not made up their minds who to vote for			0
it will be interesting to see what difference the campaigns of the various parties make to people 's intentions by polling day			0

@entity2 leader @entity8 has been buoyed by a series of tv debates opposing austerity cuts , despite threatening another referendum on independence the most popular single option is a @entity7 - @entity2 coalition , with 25 per cent support			1
both parties have ruled this out , but the response suggests that some form of @entity2 - @entity7 co-operation has significant backing , @entity15 said			1
the next most popular option is 9 per cent for the continuation of a conservative - liberal @entity124 coalition			0
nearly a third ( 31 per cent ) of @entity7 voters would prefer the option of co-operating with the @entity2 , while 28 per cent opted for a @entity7 minority government			0
if the @entity2 holds a majority of @entity1 's 59 seats in a hung parliament , voters are evenly divided between those who want the @entity2 to work with @entity7 ( 34 per cent ) and those who want the @entity2 to remain a separate bloc in the @entity135 ( 32 per cent )			1
@entity2 voters are also evenly divided - 42 per cent want to work with @entity7 and 45 per cent would want the party to remain separate			0
