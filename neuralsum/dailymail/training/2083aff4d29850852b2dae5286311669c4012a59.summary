mr @entity61 added : ' it 's great news that families can look forward to lower prices in most ski resorts this season			2
however , it is important for them to check all the resort costs they will face and add these to the package price before deciding on a ski destination so they have a true picture of what their holiday is likely to cost them			2

in almost all cases the charges for these are payable once holidaymakers reach their resort and can add hundreds of pounds to the cost of a skiing holiday			2
' enthusiasts can now try out a wide range of winter sports activities but these extras come at a price and careful budgeting is needed to make sure the ski budget does not go ' off piste '			0
