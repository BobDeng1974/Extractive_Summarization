if you have ever fancied a sapphire ring like @entity2 ’s or a crown like the @entity4 , you could grow you own			2
physicists have grown a replica of the @entity7 and the @entity2 ’s engagement ring , in a simple experiment that can be tried at home			2
the experts grew their own jewels from a chemical compound found in common household items such as drain unblocker and antiseptic cream			1
physicists have grown a replica of the @entity7 ( pictured ) and the @entity2 ’s engagement ring ( also shown ) , in a simple experiment that can be tried at home the experiment took eight months and marks the @entity4 becoming the longest reigning monarch later this year			1
it is also intended to inspire the next generation of scientists and engineers , and will go on show at the @entity30 @entity29 @entity28 next month			0
the experiment can be carried out by children in the classroom and shows the science behind acid - base reactions , which form the basis of nearly all biological processes in living things			2
the ‘ crowning glory ’ of the replica @entity7 – an imitation of @entity45 - was made from a common cleaning powder , which was mixed with boiling water to create a copper sulphate crystal			1
copper sulphate is a form of drain unblocker and is also used in antiseptic cream			1
the experts grew their own jewels ( pictured ) from copper sulphate , which is found in common household items such as drain unblocker and antiseptic cream			1
the experiment ’s intended to inspire the next generation of scientists and engineers , along with the @entity30 @entity29 @entity28 ingredients : copper sulphate powder , two glass jaws , filter paper , a wooden stick , thread , a spoon , goggles and gloves in the @entity68 experiment , the raw crystals were shaped to create facets , to make the crystals look more like the @entity71			1
scientists made the blue crystals by first adding copper sulphate powder to boiling water until the solution became saturated - when there is no more room between the water ’s molecules and nothing else will dissolve – and the solution was bright blue			1
they then filtered the mixture to remove any specks of dust and other impurities that might have got in the solution and would create cloudy crystals			0
the scientists heated the filtered mixture so that the water changed state to a gas through evaporation			0
the copper sulphate could not evaporate so it stayed behind , creating a more concentrated copper sulphate solution			2
as more water evaporated , there was less space for the copper sulphate molecules within the solution , so in order to fit in , the molecules formed symmetrical patterns , resulting in crystals			1
the solution evaporated overnight and the scientists picked the most promising crystal ‘ seeds ’ from which to grow their replica @entity71 , by hanging them from threads dipped in fresh copper sulphate solution so they could keep growing			1
the @entity68 ’s jewels also contain thousands of laboratory - grown crystals , which are almost impossible to tell apart from diamonds , for example , with the naked eye			2
synthetic gems have many important uses in everyday life such as in lasers , smartphone screens , and watch faces - boasting hardiness close to that of natural diamonds			0
scientists made the blue crystals ( pictured ) by first adding copper sulphate powder to boiling water until the solution became saturated			1
several processes later , the raw crustals were shaped by jewellers to make the professional looking ' stone ' seen in in the replica engagement ring by exposing basic chemicals to extremely high temperatures , scientists were able to create synthetic spinel , corundum and cubic zirconia crystals to mimic priceless gems including the @entity142 , @entity143 , and the @entity144 , which is the fourth largest polished diamond in the world			1
once grown , the crystals were cut to the exact specifications of the royal treasures before being carefully set into their casings by jewellers , to create the impressive replica crown			0
‘ crystals are amazing - not only are they incredibly beautiful to look at , but they are also very useful , ’ @entity154 , head of the crystal growth unit at @entity156 said			0
‘ a lot of important discoveries , many that went on to win @entity163 prizes , were only possible because of crystals			0
‘ i hope that this project will help get young people excited about science and inspired to take that excitement further with their studies and into their careers			0
’ the jewels will be on display at the fair at the @entity174 on @entity175 from march 11 to 14			0

a step - by - step guide for the experiment is also available online			0
by exposing basic chemicals to extremely high temperatures , @entity154 ( pictured ) was able to create synthetic spinel , corundum and cubic zirconia crystals to mimic priceless gems including the @entity142 , @entity143 , and the @entity144 , which is the fourth largest polished diamond in the world			0

crystals were shaped to *resemble* gems in the @entity7
copper sulphate , found in drain unblocker , was used to make blue crystals
experiment took eight months and marks the @entity4 becoming the longest reigning monarch later this year , as well as the @entity68
children can recreate the experiment to grow less polished - looking gems
