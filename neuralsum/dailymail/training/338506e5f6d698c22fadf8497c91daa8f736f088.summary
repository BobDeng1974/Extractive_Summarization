few things irritate great coaches more than suggestions that their teams are unsophisticated			0
it undermines everything they like to think they stand for			0
with this in mind , the moment @entity13 walked in to a press conference room holding four pieces of @entity19 paper on tuesday , it was always likely that an interesting 20 minutes or so lay ahead			1
the print - outs were @entity22 stats sheets , breaking down the play from @entity25 's draw at @entity26 on sunday			1
the intention was to debunk the theory - raised by @entity26 's @entity29 after the weekend 's game - that @entity25 had resorted to long - ball football at @entity32			1
@entity13 brandishes his dossier as he attempts to prove that @entity25 are not a long ball side @entity35 looks unimpressed as the @entity36 tells a packed press conference about his tactics ' when a colleague of mine is saying this kind of thing then , yeah , you have to see the data and you have to put the data in the right context , ' said @entity35			1
' i have made an interpretation of the data for this game and then i have to say that it is not a good interpretation from @entity29			1
it is not so difficult to read that			0
' i give it you , you can copy it and then maybe you can go to @entity29 and he will get a good interpretation			1
' this sheet suggests @entity25 had a 56 per cent success rate of their 41 ' long and forward ' passes during the match at @entity26			1
the blue arrows indicate a successful pass @entity26 made just 11 of their 32 ' long and forward ' passes during the match , according to boss @entity35 @entity35 claims @entity25 made 49.9 per cent of ' long passes forward ' in comparison to @entity26 's 71 per cent this page suggests @entity25 played 12 long passes after 76 minutes of their 1 - 1 draw at @entity32 on sunday			1
eight of them were successful			0
@entity35 's argument on tuesday was clear			1
his team 's long passes were , he said , aimed at spreading the play wide			1
they were not long , high deliveries up field			2
that only started , he added , when @entity81 came on with 20 minutes to go			0
' we scored from that , so i think it was a very good decision of the manager , ' @entity35 added			0
it was a clear argument and one that did n't actually need the bits of paper and the red and blue arrows to explain			0
in truth , the whole intriguing spectacle perhaps said more about @entity35 himself than it did about his team 's football			2
an immediate comparison was made by many to @entity100 's infamous ' facts ' tirade back when his @entity102 team were challenging sir @entity103 's @entity25 in 2009			1
@entity100 referred to a piece of paper that day , too			1
@entity25 's change of tack came after 6ft 4in @entity81 was brought on in the second half , @entity35 claimed @entity35 , pictured leaving the @entity32 pitch at half - time , flanked by @entity111 and @entity112 on that occasion , however , @entity100 just looked like a man buckling under pressure , a coach frazzled by the intensity of the duel with his great rival			1
tuesday seemed to be about something else entirely			2
it seemed more like a coach seeking to protect a reputation forged by years spent at @entity123 , @entity124 and @entity125			0
it was as dismissive as it was carefully constructed			0
' when you have 60 % ball possession do you think that you can do that with long balls ? ' asked @entity35 rhetorically			1
' yeah , long balls , in the width , to switch the play			2
you have to look at the data and then you will see that we did play long balls , but long balls wide , rather than to the striker			2
' a ball straight up to the forward is long ball play			1
i am sorry , but we are playing ball possession play and after 70 minutes we did not succeed , in spite of many chances in the second half , so then i changed my playing style			2
' whether @entity35 's performance on tuesday looked a little over the top is certainly a pertinent question			1
only some improved football from his team will end an argument that is actually a lot wider than @entity35 allowed it to be			0
the current issue about @entity25 's football is not restricted to the distance of their passes			1
it is more general than that			0
it is about entertainment and a coach 's ability to get the best from his players			2
is @entity35 currently doing that ? few would say so			0
@entity167 scores a late equaliser for @entity25 at @entity32 to rescue a 1 - 1 draw for @entity35 's side @entity171 opened the scoring for @entity26 in their @entity174 match against @entity25 when a colleague of mine is saying this kind of thing then , yeah , you have to see the data and you have to put the data in the right context i believe			1
i think the media is also coming to the match and you have a lot of opinion about me , or the game , or the players and now you say that you have no opinion			0
when you have 0 per cent ball possession do you think that you can do that with long balls ? yeah , long balls , in the width , to switch the play			1
you have to look at the data and then you will see that we did play long balls , but long balls wide , rather than to the striker			2
a ball to the forward striker is mainly caused by long - ball play			1
because i expected this question , i have made an interpretation of the data for this game and then i have to say that it is not a good interpretation from @entity29			1
it is not so difficult also to read that			0
i am sorry , but we are playing ball possession play and after 70 minutes we did not succeed , in spite of many chances in the second half , then i changed my playing style			2
then , of course , with the quality of @entity81 we played more forward balls and we scored from that , so i think it was a very good decision of the manager			0
but , when you see overall the long ball , and what is the percentage of that , then @entity26 have played 71 per cent of the long balls to the forwards and we 49			1
so , i give you this and you can see that the blue ones are the good ones because long balls are also very difficult , which is why i began with the explanation of ball possession			1
when you have 60 per cent ball possession you can not play long balls			1
so again , they did it 71 and we 49 , and i give it you , you can copy it and then maybe you can go to @entity29 and he will get a good interpretation			1
@entity239 , for example , is currently playing in midfield and on his worst @entity25 scoring run since 2006			2
he may be relieved , at least , to hear @entity35 say that his days as a striker are not necessarily over			0
' no , it 's dependable on the circumstances , ' said the 62 - year - old			2
' how we are satisfied , or not , how he is satisfied , or not			0
it can change every week			0
' asked next if entertainment was a priority @entity35 was categorical			0
he said : ' you know that when you see my career i think that it is enough answer			0
' i think we have played attractive games and less attractive games			0
with every club i think this is the case , so there 's no discussion			2
' in this world you have to win and play attractive , but that 's not so simple			0
of course , we have never played with the same team because of injuries			0
@entity239 was pushed out wide and into midfield by @entity25 boss @entity35 at @entity32 on sunday ' still , when you see the fans against @entity271 , there were a lot of them so they are obviously enjoying the games			2
' when i am on the streets they show that to me , so i do n't think that we are not playing attractive enough for the fans			0
' i always applaud , so i think that everyone is still happy			0
' one interesting sub-plot ahead of wednesday night 's game against @entity279 at @entity280 is that in @entity284 's table of ' long passes ' , only the @entity282 club have played more than @entity25 this season			1
it 's a label that irritates @entity279 manager @entity288 , too			0
he referred to it as ' media myth ' after his team 's draw with @entity293 on sunday			0
it seems , then , that the thorny issue of long - ball football is one that raises the hackles of managers at both ends of the age and pay scale			1
@entity288 has not resorted to bits of paper to defend himself , though			0

@entity13 produced a dossier at his press conference on tuesday
he was responding to *criticism* from @entity29 about his *gameplan*
the intention was to *rubbish* claims he *deployed* long - ball tactics
a comparison was made by many to @entity100 's infamous ' facts ' tirade
