the doctor - turned - dictator insisted that he has not used chemical weapon and rejected the findings of the @entity11 report that declared that an attack involving sarin gas did occur in the country on august 21			1
but , in a sign that he may be seeking a diplomatic thaw with the @entity17 after decades of acrimony , he said his government would abide by a @entity22 - @entity21 agreement to dispose of @entity3 's chemical weapons and hand them over to whatever nation was willing to take them			1
he added that the operation to destroy the weapons will cost about $ 1 billion and take approximately one year to complete			0
promise : @entity3 president @entity2 has vowed to destroy his country 's stockpile of chemical weapons horror : hundreds of children were killed in the attack which reportedly rained nerve gas upon thousands near the @entity3 capital of @entity37 in an interview on the @entity40 television channel , @entity2 said : ' i think it is a very complicated operation technically and it needs a lot , a lot of money			1
some estimated about a billion for the @entity3 stockpile			2
' asked whether he would be willing to hand over chemical weapons to the @entity22 government , @entity2 said : ' as i said , it needs a lot of money			1
it needs about one billion			0
it is very detrimental to the environment			0
if the @entity22 administration is ready to pay this money and take the responsibility of bringing toxic materials to the @entity22 , why do n't they do it ? ' @entity2 denied that his forces were responsible for a chemical weapons attack in @entity63 , outside @entity37 , on august 21 that brought the @entity22 close to attacking @entity3 in response			1
he did not deny that the attack occurred - saying that ' it 's despicable , it 's a crime ' - but he did clearly try to distance his forces from any culpability			2
indignant : @entity3 president @entity2 used his latest televised interview to say that there is still no evidence that his soldiers used chemical weapons under attack : @entity2 maintained that the government was continually being attacked by outside terrorist groups who are masquerading as internal opposition forces ' @entity79 gas is called the kitchen gas you know why ? because you can make it anywhere , ' he said			1
@entity2 said that the evidence cited in the @entity11 report was not all of the proof and did not prove that the weapons were used by his armed forces			0
he said the @entity3 army was advancing in the area at the time and had no need to fire rockets filled with the nerve agent sarin , as the @entity22 says it did			1
' the whole story does n't even hold together			0
so , no , we did n't			0
in one word , we did n't use any chemical weapons in @entity63 , ' he said			2
@entity11 chemical investigators confirmed on monday the use of sarin in the attack in a long - awaited report that the @entity22 , @entity106 and @entity107 said proved government forces were responsible			1
@entity2 said it was too early to make a definitive comment on the @entity11 report			0
sit down : @entity2 was interviewed by former @entity113 congressman @entity112 ( left ) and @entity40 reporter @entity114 ( next to @entity112 ) inside the presidential palace in @entity37 attacks : the chemical gas attacks occurred on august 21 in the rebel strongholds near @entity119 and was thought to have left more than 1,000 dead ' we have to look at it			1
we have to discuss it before saying if we agree or disagree			0
it was only yesterday evening , ' he said			0
asked whether he had a message for president @entity126 , @entity2 said : ' listen to your people			1
follow the common sense of your people			0
that 's enough , ' in an apparent reference to opinion polls that show @entity22 oppose any @entity22 strike on @entity3			2
former @entity22 representative @entity112 , a @entity134 and eight - term congressman from @entity136 who is now a commentator for @entity40 , took part in the interview on tuesday in @entity37 along with @entity40 senior correspondent @entity114			2
@entity112 has visited @entity2 twice before , most recently in june 2011 , after the uprising against the @entity3 president began			2
@entity3 media quoted @entity112 as saying on that trip that @entity2 was ' highly loved ' by @entity3			0
the congressman said he had been misquoted .			0

@entity3 president admitted that ' it 's not a *secret* ' that they have chemical weapons but said that they will agree to hand them over to be destroyed
