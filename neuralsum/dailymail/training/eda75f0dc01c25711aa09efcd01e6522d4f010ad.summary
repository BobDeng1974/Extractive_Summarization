by @entity0 published : 15:21 est , 24 june 2013 updated : 07:21 est , 27 june 2013 @entity3 ’s clothing has gained national attention in the past - with her semen - stained blue dress playing a role in the @entity9 sex scandal - but now it is her lingerie that is up for sale			1
a collection of her old clothes , handwritten notes , and gifts signed pictures of former president clinton are now up for sale for thousands of dollars			1
before she became notorious for her sexual relationship with president @entity9 , @entity3 also had an affair with her married former high school drama teacher @entity22			1
the whole lot : a collection of letters , cards and gifts that @entity3 gave her high school drama teacher , who she had a five - year affair with during the time when she had a sexual relationship with president @entity9 mr @entity22 gained momentary international recognition during the investigation into @entity3 's affair with president @entity9 , as he came forward and told about their lengthy affair			1
though it is unclear when or how his marriage to then - wife @entity41 ended , the two have since split and for some reason , @entity41 ended up with a collection of clothes and gifts that the couple got from @entity3 over the years			1
all of these items were included as part of the evidence gathered by @entity50 , the independent counselor pursuing the impeachment charges over the affair			2
mr @entity22 's ex-wife , who now goes by @entity54 , handed the lot over to an unidentified third party , who has since put the goods up for auction			2
personalized photos : as a staffer , @entity3 would have been able to have arranged a photo with a friend 's name that was then signed by the autopen of the president 's signature intimates : a black negligee ( left ) is included in the sale but not the infamous blue semen - stained dress ( right ) side spotlight : @entity22 , @entity3 's former high school drama teacher who had a five - year affair with his former student alongside his then - wife ' @entity3 was friends with the couple , so i think she gave some of her clothes to @entity41 , just to wear they may have exchanged some of the clothes , ' @entity77 , an auction manager at @entity79 , told @entity87			1
included are eight pieces of clothing that was ‘ gifted to @entity90 ’ including a sheer floor - length negligee			0
@entity3 ’s weight has been the subject of ridicule in the past , and the clothes that she gave the @entity96 are all sizes large and extra-large			2
the infamous blue dress is not included in the group of items up for sale			2
lookbook : a number of jackets that @entity3 gave to @entity22 's wife - all of which were size l or @entity108 while her old baggy jackets may not seem directly related to the presidential affair , there are a number of other gifts and items that @entity3 gave her former teacher from her time working as a @entity117 intern			1
weight struggles : @entity3 appears to have given some of the clothes to @entity22 's now - ex wife there are two auto - pen signed photos of mr @entity9 - and one with him alongside @entity124 - that @entity3 sent to mr @entity22			1
in her role as a @entity117 staffer , it would not have been unusual for her to submit a request for a personalized photo to be signed in the style of the president			0
she also arranged for the president to write a birthday note to @entity22 , who @entity3 carried on a five - year affair with including some time when her relationship with the two men overlapped			1
‘ @entity138 : @entity124 and i want to personally extend our warmest wishes to you as you gather with your family and friends to celebrate your birthday			0
as you look forward to the year ahead , please accept our best wishes for good health and much happiness			0
happy birthday ! ’ the typed note from @entity9 wrote			0
all of that correspondence would likely have gone through the proper channels at the @entity117 - and were not a result of the sexual relationship with the president - given that they were composed on official letterhead			2
she also gifted a pack of @entity117 matches and boxes of @entity160 with the seal of the president			0
