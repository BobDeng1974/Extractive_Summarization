shot and killed : @entity0 , 12 , who was holding an airsoft pistol in a park in @entity3 , @entity4 @entity5 is mired in fresh killer cop controversy after a post on the force 's official facebook page appeared to blame a 12 - year - old black boy for the police shooting that killed him			1
@entity0 was playing with a toy gun when he was shot dead by a white officer in @entity3 last week			1
the tragic incident further fueled the anger and protests that have raged in the wake first of a @entity19 's failure to indict @entity21 officer @entity20 for the shooting of @entity23 and , now , a second @entity19 's failure to indict the @entity26 officer @entity25 for his fatal chokehold arrest of @entity28			1
today , the @entity31 force has been slammed for the posting titled , ' kids will be kids ? ' which warned parents , ' your children should have rules for a toy gun that mirror the rules for a real gun			2
it said was not about ' whether it was a justified shooting ' but was accused of ' victim blaming ' the @entity54 posting which was tweeted on the department 's official feed continued , ' warn them that these ' toys ' do look like real guns and could result in getting the police called on them			1
the police may get called to respond to a ' child with a gun ' … if the type of gun is in question by the witness the @entity5 will respond as though it is a real gun			1
' the post read by many as victim - blaming went onto provide ' tips ' for how a child should behave in such a situation			1
' do not run away			0
they need to no longer have the gun in their hands , throw it away from them			0
they need to comply with officers instructions			0
they may be ordered to lie down on the ground			0
' within minutes of tweeting this posting at 7.59am the @entity93 of @entity95 department whose officer wrote the post was facing demands to have their twitter account closed down			1
critics dammed the post as ' heartless ' and ' victim blaming ' and described the officers as ' psychopaths			1
' later in the day chief @entity105 used the same page to apologize for the post			2
' the post conveyed the message that my officers respond to calls involving a child with a gun with indiscretion and little regard for life , ' he admitted			1
' the intention of the post was to inform citizens about the potential danger of airsoft or pellet guns resembling real guns			0
' however , the post was a misguided communication strategy and was offensive to many people			0
' as chief of police , i apologize to @entity0 ’s family and anyone who was offended by the post			1
' while the post did not originate from the @entity132 and i was unaware of its presence prior to its release , i realize the message was insensitive to @entity0 ’s family and the sorrow they are currently experiencing			2
' but the @entity140 officer who wrote the post has defended his actions			0
neighborhood cop @entity143 said ' i too was a kid , and i would have done the same thing as @entity0 did			2
officer @entity143 , who used the official @entity52 and @entity54 accounts to post on the shooting of @entity0 profuse apology : chief @entity105 used @entity54 to repudiate the earlier post and admit that it suggested his officers do not care about young lives mourned : 12 - year - old @entity0 was buried yesterday after being shot by officers last weekend fatal moment : @entity42 shows the 12 - year - old reaching towards the airsoft gun in his waistband ' i was allowed to go play with guns and have bb guns - we did n't have @entity160 at the time			1
the point of ' kids will be kids ' is that 's what kids will do … ' the point of putting [ the post ] out was to educate and make sure something like this does n't happen in the city of @entity140 or in our area			0
' as for @entity0 , @entity51 added , ' it 's a tragedy			0
it 's a shame that a child got shot			0
i guess that 's all i should probably say about it			0
' the post has now been removed from the facebook page and the link deleted from the force 's official twitter feed			2
a spokesman for @entity5 disowned the posting and described it as unauthorized			2
the force was preparing to issue a statement at time of writing .			0
