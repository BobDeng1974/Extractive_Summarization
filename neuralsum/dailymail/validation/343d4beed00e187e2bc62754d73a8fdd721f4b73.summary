streetwise urban ants from @entity1 have developed a taste for the kind of diet frequently chosen by their human neighbours			1
tests on insects collected from pavements and traffic islands in @entity11 show that their bodies contain the molecular fingerprint of junk food			1
the same was not true of more genteel ants that frequent leafy park areas			1
the scientists tested more than 100 ants representing 21 species from dozens of sites in the @entity21			1
lead researcher dr @entity22 , from @entity23 , said : ' human foods clearly make up a significant portion of the diet in urban species			0
these are ants eating our garbage , and this may explain why pavement ants are able to achieve such large populations in cities			2
' the scientists tested more than 100 ants representing 21 species from dozens of sites in the @entity21			2
their diet was assessed by analysing the kind of carbon in their bodies			2
all animals , including humans , take in carbon from food , but the atomic ' strain ' of the element found in the ants was specifically associated with corn and sugar cane			1
corn and refined sugar are both abundant in human processed foods where they are used as sweeteners and flavour enhancers			1
evidence of the signature carbon - 13 isotope indicated that the ants had adopted a junk food diet			1
the species with the highest levels of carbon - 13 was the most common ant on the street , the ' pavement ant ' @entity66			0
like members of inner city gangs , @entity68 soldiers engage in violent turf wars as rival colonies fight for territory			0
they also do a lot of breaking and entering of people 's homes , and are a recognised house pest			0
tests on insects collected from pavements and traffic islands in @entity11 show that their bodies contain the molecular fingerprint of junk food			1
the scientists , whose findings are reported in the journal @entity88 , discovered one street - living ant that turned its antennae up at human food			2
@entity92 , only identified in @entity1 in the past five years , was also found in high numbers on @entity11 's pavements and traffic islands			1
but the isotope analysis showed no evidence of a human - like diet			0
instead , the ant appeared to divide its time between subterranean nests and foraging in the branches of city trees			0
' this highlights the complex nature of urban ecosystems and how much we still have to learn about how these species relate to each other and to the environment , ' said dr @entity22			0
' we wanted to learn more about why some ant species are able to live alongside us , on sidewalks or in buildings , while other species stay on the outskirts of human development , " says dr @entity22 ,			0
" this could also help us determine which species are doing the most to clean up our trash			0
