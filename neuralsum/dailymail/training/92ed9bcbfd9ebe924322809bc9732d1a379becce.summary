@entity0 burst into tears on the @entity2 chat show @entity3 on tuesday after throwing wine at fellow guest @entity5			1
the chat show hosted by @entity7 aired following the latest episode of @entity9 in which @entity0 also tossed wine on new housewife @entity11			1
@entity5 , 44 , who stars in @entity2 's flipping out home renovation series , made a joke about getting a sexually transmitted disease from @entity0 , 42 , touching his hair and it struck a raw nerve			2
' i 'm taking five , ' @entity0 said clearly overcome with emotion			2
@entity0 in her 2014 book @entity35 : @entity36 claimed that she caught a sexually transmitted disease - human papillomavirus - from her ex-husband @entity38			1
@entity5 tried to reach over and apologise but was initially rebuffed by @entity0 as she tried to gather herself			0
' i 'm not going to touch her , i 'm just saying sorry , ' @entity5 said			0
too far : @entity0 burst into tears on the chat show after @entity5 brought up a touchy subject taking a break : @entity0 turned away from the cameras after having her feelings hurt that was awkward : talk show host @entity7 tried to get the show back on track after @entity0 started crying @entity7 tried to salvage the show , but it was clearly awkward for everyone			1
tossing wine appeared to be one of @entity0 's favourite sports as she flung a full glass of wine in @entity11 's face for no reason at all in the latest episode of @entity59			0
@entity0 had already taken a girls ' night out into an unexpectedly awkward direction when she confronted @entity11 about how she and her husband , @entity62 , were married to other people when they met			0
calm before the storm : the reality tv star arriving at the @entity2 studios in the mood for crazy : @entity0 was in high spirits as she posed for fans but she then made it even worse when she drunkenly started insisting @entity11 act like her character on the tv soap opera @entity72 , even giving her $ 40 to do it and leaving @entity11 clearly annoyed as she asked : ' what am i , a circus seal ? ' then out of nowhere @entity0 flung her wine in @entity11 's face - leaving the actress in tears and the other housewives stunned			1
admitting she was ' confused and angry and humiliated ' , @entity11 said : ' it 's just shocking and bizarre			0
' dishing it out : @entity0 tossed a glass of wine on @entity11 on tuesday night 's episode of @entity9 surprise shower : @entity11 was unexpectedly doused by @entity0 and fellow dinner guest @entity88 insisted she would ' probably be in a cop car ' if @entity0 had done the same to her , calling it ' absolutely inappropriate - and f * * * ing weird '			1
the next day , telling husband @entity92 that she had n't slept all night because of it , @entity11 admitted she was concerned at how much of a ' creepy fan ' @entity0 appears to be of her tv show			1
' i 'm going to be very cautious around @entity0 , ' @entity11 admitted			0
' i think she 's capable of almost anything			0
' jaw - dropping : @entity88 was shocked by @entity0 's behaviour not nice : @entity11 was soaked by wine tossed onto her by @entity0 the wild wine attack was the talk of a dinner thrown the next evening by @entity103 , even after @entity0 instantly apologized to @entity11 , blaming drink and wanting ' a soap opera moment '			1
but the other housewives may be less forgiving			0
' i want to take care of her - but i also want to f * * * ing spank her at the same time , ' said @entity88 who insisting @entity0 was ' a wounded little girl ' who needs attention			1
and @entity112 - who @entity113 had only just started to make peace with after their earlier falling out - was also clearly outraged			2
' this is a beautiful elegant woman - @entity11 , not @entity0 - and to throw a glass of wine in her face ? i 've heard and seen some things from @entity0 but this is a whole new low , ' @entity88 insisted			2
new low : @entity112 said that @entity0 had reached a new low by throwing wine at @entity11 while @entity11 insisted she accepted @entity0 's apology , she admitted later : ' still do n't trust her			2
' @entity0 then sparked further offense at @entity103 's party , telling singer babyface that his wife 's rings ' could be bigger ' - and then telling @entity103 's husband @entity130 that he looked like he was ' finger banging ' as he excitedly gesticulated with @entity127 as they tried to write an impromptu song			2
' if that 's not some white trash i do n't know what is , ' @entity88 said of @entity0 's behavior			0
gulp it down : @entity0 was the talk of dinner after throwing wine on @entity11 her latest acting out came just hours after she appeared to be getting somewhere with @entity112 , taking her to lunch for a heart - to - heart after weeks of trying to patch - up their friendship			1
but while they made some progress , @entity88 made it evident things will never be as they were before , warning @entity0 : ' i ca n't be the friend that you want			0
' and when @entity0 later told friends that they were ' moving forward but just taking it slow ' , @entity88 stressed : ' really slow			0
