by @entity1 reporter published : 18:31 est , 30 july 2013 updated : 01:57 est , 31 july 2013 drivers should wear sun cream in their cars even when the windows are closed , doctors have advised			2
they warned that the sun ’s damaging rays can penetrate glass , raising the risk of skin cancer			1
while glass will block uvb rays , which cause sunburn , the more - damaging @entity13 rays pass through			1
slap it on : drivers have been warned to apply sunscreen even if they have their windows closed to avoid harmful @entity13 rays despite people spending more time driving than gardening or exercising , they are less likely to wear sunscreen when in a car than outdoors , it was found			1
just 15 per cent of people said they used sun cream ‘ most of the time ’ while driving – a figure described as ‘ dismal ’ by the researchers from @entity28 in the @entity29			2
in contrast , 38 per cent said they would normally wear sunscreen when outdoors			0
surprisingly , those with a history of skin cancer were no more likely to wear sun cream than others			1
the @entity41 researchers asked 225 men and women to fill in a survey about their driving habits , including how often they drove with the window open and when they wore sunscreen			0
many had been treated for skin cancer in the past			2
two - thirds of those questioned believed they did n’t need to wear sun cream if the windows were closed			0
dr @entity56 , one of the researchers , said : ‘ like the majority of patients in our study , i too used to feel protected from the sun while in a vehicle , unfortunately this is not true			0
‘ because such a large proportion of a person ’s cumulative sun exposure occurs while in a vehicle , automobile - related @entity13 exposure is a considerable public health concern			0
’ dismal : just 15 per cent of people apply sunscreen when driving despite them spending more time in their cars than outside gardening or exercising while windscreens and tinted windows offer protection , much of the sun ’s rays pass through side and rear windows			1
dr @entity56 cited previous research which showed that laminated glass in windscreens blocks 98 per cent of harmful @entity13 rays from the sun. but these rays – which penetrate deep into the skin causing ageing , eye damage and skin cancers – can easily penetrate the non-laminated glass of side and rear windows , with at least 80 per cent passing through			1
is the parasol absolutely necessary ? dr @entity56 said : ‘ the good news is that this damage can be limited by wearing sun creams , long sleeve shirts , and protective eyewear			0
’ he added that although he did his research in @entity41 , @entity102 should also take care , especially in the summer			0
non-malignant melanoma , the most prevalent type of skin cancer affecting 100,000 people in the @entity102 each year , was found to occur more often on the arm closest to the driver ’s window			2
among those who took part in the study , this was the left arm			0
but research from countries with predominantly right - hand drive cars , such as the @entity102 , found higher numbers of the cancers on the right arm			0
the study , published in the @entity123 , also found that when people did apply sunscreen , it was frequently in the wrong place			1
for instance , it was often not applied to arms and hands – despite them being exposed to the sun while driving			0
@entity134 , of @entity135 , said : ‘ although this is a small study that relied on skin cancer patients recalling what they did in the past , it ’s a reminder to consider sun protection even for everyday activities like driving			1
‘ @entity143 can block uvb rays but most do n’t block @entity13 rays – so your skin may still be getting damaged			1

few *motorists* apply sunscreen when driving despite skin cancer risk
doctors warn glass offers no protection from harmful @entity13 rays
at least 80 per cent of @entity13 rays get through , causing ageing and cancer
study finds sunscreen often applied in the wrong places by drivers
