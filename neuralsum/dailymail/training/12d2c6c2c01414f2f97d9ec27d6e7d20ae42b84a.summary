by @entity1 reporter published : 06:23 est , 22 august 2013 updated : 12:42 est , 22 august 2013 @entity2 up with incessantly rising food prices ? then maybe you should take a leaf out of the book of this young man , who always has a fully stocked fridge but never spends a penny at the checkout			2
for @entity13 one man 's rubbish is his treasure as he stocks his fridge full of the food he finds in dustbins			1
from fresh vegetables and eggs to juicy steaks and ready - made meals , mr @entity18 scavenges food from supermarket bins and uses it to cook delicious meals for himself , his friends and even the local community			1
the thrifty 22 - year - old spends nothing on eating since he scavenges all his food from supermarket dustbins around @entity35 , @entity36 a good haul : some of the food found by @entity39 and his freegan friends who dig through bins nightly in search of edible food , flowers and any other usable items as part of their efforts to live an anti-consumerist lifestyle fully stocked : mr @entity18 's fridges groan under the weight of food he and friends have recovered from rubbish a bath full of the juices mr @entity18 and friends have found : ' you can find anything you see on the shelves in a supermarket in the bin , organic vegetables , fruit , juices , eggs , milk , yoghurt , ' he said dining on food from a bin may not sound like the ingredients for a perfect meal to most , but for mr @entity18 ' dumpster diving ' is a way of life			1
the thrifty 22 - year - old from @entity35 , @entity36 , is a @entity78 , which means he adopts an anti-consumerist lifestyle			1
he opposes materialism , conformity and greed and believes in consuming little and wasting less			0
mr @entity18 and his band of fellow freegans dig through bins in search of edible food , flowers and any other usable items			1
they then sift through the gleaned goodies and determine which are useful			0
rotten food is thrown away and salvageable food is washed and used to make meals			1
mr @entity18 and fellow freegans beam with delight at their haul of food : mr @entity18 said he 's been raiding dustbins since he was at university , but it is only since last summer he has survived exclusively off found food who needs food banks ? as this picture shows , mr @entity18 and friends have more food than they can store overflow : they are even forced to keep some of their massive haul outside on the verandah @entity116 is the spice of life : since everything is free , they can afford to have several different kinds of potatoes in their larder - plus sweet potatoes to boot mr @entity18 said : ' i started dumpster diving when i was at university , there was a group of freegan 's who regularly got together at the nearby supermarket			1
' i 've been a freegan for around four years now but since last summer i 've got all my food from a dumpster			2
' you can find anything you see on the shelves in a supermarket in the bin , organic vegetables , fruit , juices , eggs , milk , yoghurts			0
' when i first heard of dumpster diving i really wrestled with the idea , what does it mean to buy food in a supermarket and then see that same food in thrown away ? ' there 's a bunch of food that 's thrown away , just because of a packaging default			2
no - one wants to buy something where the packaging is torn so the supermarket ca n't sell that and throw it away			0
' sometimes they 'll be a box of a dozen eggs where one yolk has broken and there 's egg on the box , so it 's thrown away even though 11 of the eggs are perfectly fine			0
' supermarkets also purposely buy more than they can sell so their shelves look plentiful and that excess food ends up in the bin			2
' expiration dates also a reason why good food is often binned , they say it expires but there 's no legal guidance on expiration dates and the food is still perfectly fine to eat after it is said to have expired			2
' the problem is an economic one , it 's not as easy as telling supermarkets to give this food away instead of throwing it away			0
' we should n't be shopping at large grocery or convenience stores and instead buying quantity in bulk from local distributors or farmers markets			0
' cooking up a storm : mr @entity18 has been able to scavenge so much food from bins that it 's too much for him to eat , so in order to make the most of this free food he started sharing it with his community cookery show - style presentation : a spread of food prepared using the food mr @entity18 and friends have found humble pie : a delicious looking dessert made from scavenged fruit mr @entity18 and his friends in @entity36 are n't the only @entity214 embracing the @entity78 trend			1
in @entity218 , as economic hard times continue for many , @entity78 groups have sprung up running tours of the city 's bins			1
one group organises monthly ' trash tours ' so that people can seek the best places for free food , sourced potatoes , peppers , packaged salads , yogurts , pasta , bread rolls and hummus and make their own burgers and barbecue food from the ingredients			2
organiser @entity237 , who has been practising @entity78 for two decades , said : ' we 're finding these tours to be extremely popular			2
' they are filling up with newcomers who are shocked by the level of waste and who now realise what they can recover from supermarket bins			0
' once a month , we invite new attendees to come on our trash tours of the village and then for a meal the next day with the food we 've recovered			0
' there is no reason for this food to be thrown out			0
it is just as good now as it was 20 minutes ago when it was in the supermarket			0
' many of the @entity78 are young professionals who are environmentally and politically conscious , but we also find that many of them are people who can not afford the high cost of food in @entity218			1
' free flowers : food is n't the only thing mr @entity18 finds in supermarket dustbins			1
here he gives away blooms back in @entity35 , mr @entity18 has been able to scavenge so much food from bins that it 's too much for him to eat , so in order to make the most of this free food he started sharing it with his community			1
he now plans to open his own @entity78 café called the @entity276 , where he plans to serve the food to diners for free			1
