even a mouthful of worms did n’t stop the magpie from its frenzied assault			0
mr @entity4 said he was cycling down @entity15 , in @entity15 , near @entity16 , @entity17 , when the lone bird took aim			1
however , during breeding , a small percentage of them can be aggressive , swooping at passers - by in their territory , ’ he wrote on @entity24			1
‘ just avoid the known area for a couple months is my best advice			0
’ @entity35 breeding season began in september and close calls with the birds have been well - documented on social media with posts from people recounting the moment they are terrorised by the bird			1
the bird returned to peck at the man 's helmet six times on the quiet stretch of road even a mouthful of worms did n’t stop the magpie from its frenzied assault mr @entity4 advised people to avoid the known area for a couple months mr @entity4 captured the bird on his @entity10 camera in one @entity58 photo , a magpie with its wings spread in full flight is seen diving towards - and just missing - the scalp of a surprised @entity61 student in @entity62 , @entity63			1
on @entity65 , people have told of their brushes with the pesky bird in 140 characters or less			0
' apologies to anyone in @entity73 who may have just heard the blood - curdling shrieks of someone caught off guard by a magpie swoop , ' @entity70 's @entity69 wrote			1
keeping up with current affairs , @entity78 , @entity79 posted : ' so when are @entity81 doing something about upping the @entity84 level ? that 's the real danger			0
' while @entity86 issued a warning : ' @entity88 # @entity89 ( sic ) rt : i have seen a tweet on @entity65 by a cyclist they have had their first magpie swoop of the season			1
' this photo shows a magpie narrowly missing the scalp of a @entity61 student people have taken to social media for the past couple of days to tell of their experiences of magpie swooping but screaming , yelling and making a big fuss is not the way to deter these native creatures from leaving you alone			0
@entity110 's education officer @entity109 said the best way to deal with a rogue bird was to quietly walk away			2
' they can swoop past your head and it ’s a warning but it 's only occasionally that people have had them peck their head , ' she told @entity120			1
' if you stand still and put your hands over your head , they ’ll stop because you ’re not threatening them			2
' do not wave your arms around , walk quietly do n’t make a big fuss , and they ’ll leave you alone			0
' the more fuss you make over a bird attacking , the more likely it will continue september is when magpies breed and swooping is way for them to protect their young walking away quietly with your hands over your head is the best way to cope with swooping magpies ms @entity135 said the season would only last for about a month - depending on when eggs are laid - and it was always the male bird that was swooping because he was trying to protect his young			1
@entity140 and @entity142 's @entity141 also warned people not to pick up young birds they found			1
' [ @entity35 ] parents will often leave them on the ground for two or three days at a time to teach them to be independent , so they can learn how to feed themselves and hunt , ' she said			1
' that ’s when young magpies are taken into care [ by people ] because they think the magpies have been abandoned , but they have n't			1
' and the best way to defend oneself from magpies was to protect your head			1
' people use ice cream containers with eyes to scare them off , ' ms @entity141 said			2
' but it does n’t stop the magpie from swooping			0
it may not come as close but it will swoop			2
' it will protect the head - that ’s a main thing			1
' i actually suggest people who are walking to wear a wide - brimmed hat or an umbrella			0
' it ’s also important to have your eyes protected			2
this is more about protecting than deterring them			0
' magpies are also selective when it comes to their targets			2
ms @entity141 said research had found there were four kinds of stimulus magpies would attack and they would stick with that one type			2
' there are magpies who will attack people on a motorbike - like posties - or other fast moving vehicles that they consider an animal , ' she said			2
' then there ’s the magpie that attacks someone on a bike			0
that ’s a fast moving predator not quite as noisy			0
' then someone who is jogging and then there ’s a magpie that will attack someone walking			0
' they will only go for one type			0
if one goes for a motorbike , it wo n’t attack someone who ’s walking			0
' it depends on their experience with a stimulus			0
they may have had some sort of encounter and think that it ’s a threat			0
' experts recommend wearing a wide - brimmed hat and carrying an umbrella as protection against the birds always wear protection to safeguard yourself from injuries when attacked by the birds the breeding season usually only lasts for about four weeks , depending on when eggs are laid			1

@entity4 was attacked on his bike near @entity16 , @entity17
@entity35 breeding season began in september and will shortly end
birds swoop to protect their young and its the males who defend the nest
the best way to deal with magpies is to protect your head and your eyes
