a dog who was rescued ten years ago from the flooded aftermath of @entity3 is now helping other abandoned animals at the @entity5 , as a ' nanny ' in the organization 's new kitten nursery			1
the @entity10 mix named @entity11 is helping the five to eight - week old kittens socialize and adjust to being around other animals , which make them better candidates for adoption			1
calm @entity11 lets the little kittens snuggle up and play , without so much as a bark or growl			0
he does n’t get excited			0
he does n’t get in their face , ' @entity40 's @entity39 said ' he ’s been an unofficial nanny for us			2
when he came into the nursery , he was the perfect dog for this role , because he ’s so laid - back , ' the @entity40 's @entity39 told @entity48			2
' he does n’t care about what the kittens [ do ]			0
he does n’t get excited			0
he does n’t get in their face			0
he just basically lets them come to him on their terms			0
it ’s the perfect first interaction with a dog for these guys			0
' the reason for @entity11 ' stoic personality may have to do with the fact that he lived through @entity3 nearly a decade ago - which is how he got his name			2
' his paws were so ripped up , he had ( such ) intense burns on his paws that he needed medical attention — hence , how he got the name boots , ' @entity64 , a spokeswoman for the humane society , said of boots who was just two years old at the time			0
pounce : boots was one of 300 dogs rescued in the aftermath of @entity3 , and unfortunately he was never reunited with his original owners			1
luckily though , one volunteer with the @entity5 adopted boots and he now lives with her in @entity28 a cat dog : the @entity10 mix started volunteering in the kitten nursery because he interacts so well his his owner @entity88 's cats at home boots got his name from his paws , which were so torn up after @entity3 that he required surgery above , a picture of a younger boots after he was rescued from @entity3 boots was one of the 300 dogs found abandoned in @entity25 after the hurricane , and one of the 240 that were never reunited with their owners			1
but volunteers with the @entity5 took a shining to boots and he was adopted by volunteer @entity88 who took him to live at her home in @entity28 , along with her cats			1
because he got along so well with his new owner 's cats , boots seemed a perfect dog to help the kittens in the @entity5 ' new kitten nursery , which opened in may			1
now @entity11 visits the nursery once a week to interact with the kittens , who appear very comfortable around the much - bigger dog in pictures posted to the society 's facebook page .			1

boots , a @entity10 mix , was one of the 300 dogs found abandoned in @entity25 after @entity3 in 2005
volunteers were never able to reunite the then 2 - year - old dog with his owners , but a *worker* with the @entity5 adopted him
boots got along so well with his new owner 's cats that he now works as a nanny for abandoned kittens
