@entity1 midfielder @entity0 feels the team may have finally begun showing their best form after knitting together a cohesive performance which produced goals			1
the 4 - 1 home win over @entity7 was the first time since late march the side had scored that many in the league			1
goals , over 100 of them , were what the @entity14 built their title challenge on last season but their strength up front disappeared with the sale of @entity20 and loss of @entity22 to injury			2
@entity0 is mobbed by his team - mates after scoring his second goal of the night at @entity26 @entity27 ( left ) fires the ball into @entity0 's shoulder , resulting in the midfielder 's first goal however , they are approaching the time when , 12 months ago , they went on an incredible run which saw them almost pip @entity37 for the @entity39 crown and with @entity22 to return in the next few weeks optimism is beginning to grow again			1
' the last two or three weeks we really feel as if we have turned a corner , ' said @entity0			1
' we 've been picking up results and playing better - that was missing for the first three months of the season			2
' against @entity46 we felt hard done by to only get a point ( they dominated the game but drew 2 - 2 ) , we put in a gritty performance against @entity51 ( to win 1 - 0 ) and it was important we got the win against @entity7			2
@entity0 scored twice during @entity1 's 4 - 1 @entity39 win against @entity7 on monday @entity0 claims @entity1 are finally beginning to show their best form as the season reaches the halfway stage ' we knew the @entity59 period was a great chance for us to pick up maximum points and slide up the table and we are looking for more of the same against @entity63 on thursday			1
' @entity0 produced arguably his best performance in a @entity1 shirt since his Â£ 25million summer move from @entity67 with two goals against @entity7			1
he accepts he has had a tough time settling in , especially with a number of other new arrivals , but believes everyone is starting to find their feet			1
' it 's been difficult , we 're not going to shy away from that , for one reason or another , ' he added			2
' the lads are slowly settling into the team and @entity81 ( playing as the third centre - back ) was brilliant			2
@entity1 celebrate their fourth goal against @entity7 , the first time in nine months they have scored four ' i thought @entity85 and @entity86 put in really disciplined performances			1
' it 's not easy for them coming from abroad , being young , not being able to speak the language , so i 'm really happy for them as well as the team			2
' @entity0 was happy with his own performance , which was the first time since march 2012 he has scored twice - those goals coming against @entity95 in the @entity96			1
his first may have had a touch of good fortune when goalkeeper @entity100 's clearance rebounded off him but the second involved some nifty footwork and a clinical finish			0
@entity0 celebrates with @entity85 ( left ) , and the midfield heaped praise on his young @entity106 teammate @entity85 , one of @entity108 ' summer signings , scored @entity1 's first goal on monday night ' it was nice			1
the first one people can say it was lucky but if you do n't close down the keeper then you do n't get the goal , ' he added			1
' i 've played lot of my football in a central role and i feel more relaxed and comfortable there with a bit more of a free role			0
' after an odd performance at @entity51 , where they were second best but came away with three points , the display against @entity7 was more akin with the way they played against @entity46 just before @entity59			0
manager @entity108 has tinkered with formations and selections but he now feels everyone is on board with how he wants to play - and that is on the front foot in a 3 - 4 - 3 set - up			0
' that was what was missing from our way of working for the first period of the season , ' he said			0
the 26 - year - old slides his second goal past the @entity144 during the second half at @entity26 ' we are a team that plays with a big pressure , we have got technically - gifted players in the team , but that ability to press the ball allows them to get chances and create chances at the far end of the field			1
' if you look at how we played against @entity157 we were very unfortunate and we conceded poor goals but the creativity started that day			0
' we looked at a shape and system that could get us back to how we played last year			0
' we did n't quite get that result but i saw enough			0
we moved on to @entity164 and played really well , @entity46 we deserved more and again the performance was better			0
' we had to show a different side against @entity51 and @entity51 's result against @entity37 ( a 2 - 2 draw ) showed what a great result we had at @entity171			0
' against @entity7 we came out with the intensity and work - rate and got a reward			0
' our creativity was very much there but a solid base behind it and that is key for us			0

@entity1 scored four times for the first time in the league since march
@entity0 scored a lucky first goal and a brilliant second
