@entity1 leaders are telling mps to vote against a proposed ban on aborting babies on the grounds of their gender			1
a document circulated by the @entity8 ( @entity8 ) argued that the amendment to make sex - selective abortions illegal would ‘ divide communities ’			1
it also suggests there can be ‘ compelling circumstances ’ to allow abortion of female foetuses – such as if a woman is at risk of domestic abuse			0
the @entity8 has urged @entity21 mps to oppose a ban on sex - selective abortion which will be debated today the unions ’ intervention into the debate provoked a major row last night ahead of today ’s vote on the issue			1
religious groups , including @entity32 community leaders and representatives of the @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity37 faiths , said there was no division on the practice and that they all viewed sex - selective abortion as abhorrent			1
there was also a furious reaction from @entity20 , including some from @entity1 - backed @entity21 , who demanded to know why the @entity8 was telling them how to vote on an issue of conscience			1
some senior @entity48 accused the unions of trying to use their financial muscle and influence over @entity21 to manipulate voting			1
the practice of aborting babies because of their gender has long been suspected to exist among some @entity32 communities , in which sons are said to be more valued than daughters			2
@entity48 mp @entity60 ’s amendment , which has been promised support by 100 mps , attempts to clear up confusion about whether the practice is illegal			1
it seeks to establish in law that ‘ nothing in section one of the @entity69 is to be interpreted as allowing a pregnancy to be terminated on the grounds of the sex of the unborn child ’			0
@entity48 mp @entity60 has tabled an amendment which will clarify the law on gender - selective abortion but @entity21 mps have been urged to ‘ consider opposing this amendment ’ by the @entity8			1
an email signed by the @entity8 ’s @entity81 representative @entity80 said there was no evidence to suggest sex - selective abortion has been happening and that official guidance already says an abortion can not be authorised by gender alone			1
it added : ‘ the amendment does not attempt to address the root causes of deeply entrenched gender discrimination but rather has divided communities			0
’ last night , @entity21 mp @entity92 said : ‘ to [ suggest ] the amendment is dividing communities is unsubstantiated ... they wo n’t have any evidence			2
’ @entity48 mp @entity96 said : ‘ it is a great shame that the @entity8 , which represents the lion ’s share of the paymasters of the @entity21 , has chosen to intervene in this way			1
’ miss @entity80 claimed the support of several community groups , but only named one specifically @entity32 organisation – the @entity103			0
the briefing paper sent round by the @entity8 suggested it could be right in some circumstances for a doctor to approve sex - selective abortion – for example , if a woman did not want a girl for ‘ cultural ’ reasons and could be abused by her husband if she kept the baby			1
it 's offensive rubbish , say @entity116 dr @entity117 said toleration of sex - selective abortion would lead to the slippery slope of ' designer babies ' the @entity123 ’s major @entity32 faith groups were last night united in condemning the union ’s abortion warning			2
@entity35 , @entity37 and @entity36 representatives all gave their full support for gender - selective abortions to be criminalised			1
and they attacked the @entity8 ’s suggestion that it should not be outlawed because of ‘ complexities ’ to do with cultural issues as ‘ ridiculous rubbish ’			0
dr @entity133 of the @entity134 said : ‘ the claim that the amendment is divisive is ridiculous			0
‘ no - one will accept that			0
how will this divide communities ? this is upsetting only the pro-choice people , that ’s all			2
’ he added : ‘ all the major faith groups in the @entity123 are strongly united against this criminal act of killing girls in abortion			0
‘ why in a civilised society do you target girls to be killed ? why are we going the way of @entity153 and @entity154 in targeting girls ? ’ @entity156 , of the @entity157 , agreed and described the @entity8 ’s opposition to the ban as ‘ outrageous ’			2
she said : ‘ they should n’t be saying that			0
this is completely out of the @entity8 ’s remit			0
’ in response to the claim that there might be ‘ cultural ’ reasons for allowing a gender - specific abortion , she said : ‘ it is appalling that they can make such generalised statements , that they can say something like that			2
we are in support of sex - selective abortions being a criminal offence because it will act as a deterrent and people might think twice			1
‘ it does n’t mean that there will be wife - battering as a result			0
it will simply send out a clear message that sex - selective abortions are illegal , unacceptable and will not be tolerated in this country			1
’ dr @entity117 , @entity35 co-chairman of the @entity188 , said : ‘ toleration of sex - selective abortion would put @entity123 on the slippery slope to designer families			2
‘ @entity134 teaching is very clear on this – it is not allowed , period			0
i am extremely worried about this being abused			0
’ @entity36 leaders also spoke out against the practice , saying they had been campaigning on the issue for years			0
in a letter on the @entity205 amendment , members of the @entity200 and @entity201 of @entity202 @entity123 wrote : ‘ we are all united in the belief that sex - selective abortion must end			2
we were campaigning for this long before @entity60 or anyone else became interested			0

@entity48 mp @entity60 is seeking a ban on gender - selective abortions
at least 100 mps have said they will support the *legislative* change today
the @entity8 has warned that such a change could ' divide communities '
they have urged @entity21 mps to oppose the change to the 1967 act
