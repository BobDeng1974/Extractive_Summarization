by @entity0 the morning - after pill may not prevent pregnancies in overweight women , it emerged last night			1
fears were raised over @entity6 , @entity8 ’s most popular emergency contraceptive , after the maker of a similar pill said theirs did not work among women over a certain weight			1
studies show that @entity6 , which contains the same key ingredient as @entity6 , is less effective among women who weigh more than 11 stone 11lb and does not work at all in women over 12 stone 8lb			1
the average @entity8 woman weighs around 11 stone			1
fears were raised over the top - selling @entity8 pill @entity6 - which contains the same key ingredient as @entity6 @entity6 is not sold in the @entity8 but at least 200,000 prescriptions a year are written out for @entity6 and similar drugs			1
many more packets are sold over the counter			0
the drugs watchdog , the @entity28 , stressed that women should continue to follow their doctors ’ advice			0
however , it is to review if @entity6 and other morning - after pills containing levonorgestrel – a synthetic version of the female sex hormone progesterone – need to carry a warning about weight			1
the @entity39 , the @entity40 watchdog , is carrying out a review and , on the @entity42 , @entity6 will carry warnings			2
the issue came to light two years ago , when an @entity46 study found that obese women were more than three times as likely as those of normal weight to become pregnant after taking the morning - after pill			1
the link was particularly strong for levonorgestrel - based pills			0
it is thought that the drug may be diluted in bigger women or broken down more quickly by their bodies			0
it is also possible that the drug is soaked up by their fat cells , stopping it from working properly			0
weight limit : @entity6 only works well for women who weigh less than 165 pounds , the manufacturer says professor @entity66 , the study ’s lead researcher , advised bigger women to have a copper coil , or @entity69 , fitted or take @entity70 , another morning - after pill containing a different chemical			1
it works for longer than @entity6 and is more effective and can be taken up to five days after unprotected sex			1
professor @entity66 said : ‘ if you can only get levonorgestrel , then if it were me , i ’d take it and hope i was lucky			0
’ dr @entity79 , of the @entity80 , said that among overweight and obese women , the drug is probably absorbed by their fat more quickly , giving it less time to work			2
dr @entity86 said : ‘ it has less of a chance to delay ovulation and there are lower levels of the drug to have an effect			0
’ she said it was n’t clear if giving bigger women a higher dose would solve the problem			0
do n't use our product : the maker of @entity6 has told women weighing more than 176 pounds the pill will not work for them the @entity103 urged concerned women to seek medical advice			1
@entity106 , the @entity103 ’s clinical spokesman , said : ‘ it is particularly important that we do n’t put some women off taking emergency contraception because they think it wo n’t work			2
it is always better to use some form of emergency contraception than none at all			0
’ a @entity6 dose consists of one tablet that should be taken within 72 hours of unprotected sex , although it is more effective the sooner it is taken			2
it is thought to prevent pregnancy by interfering with the release of eggs and disrupting fertilisation			0
it may also stop any fertilised egg from implanting in the womb			0
@entity6 ’s manufacturer , @entity127 , did not respond to requests for a comment .			2
