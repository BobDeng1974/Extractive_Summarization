police are hunting a saboteur who left hundreds of drawing pins on a cycle track where racing bikers were travelling at speeds of up to 50mph			1
the spikes , which were placed on a downhill stretch of road during a cycling event near @entity11 in @entity12 , were painted black to blend in with the surface			1
more than 70 competitors were left with punctures as a result of the prank , which some are claiming is ‘ attempted murder ’ , after the tacks were scattered on a hairpin bend			1
he had been travelling at about 50mph when he noticed his front wheel clicking but was fortunate enough to stop safely and repair his inner tube			0
he said : ‘ i only hope that the culprits are caught and that their punishment is enough to dissuade from this			0
‘ the placement of these drawing pins on a really fast descent , just before a hairpin bend can only lead to the conclusion that the saboteur was hoping to cause serious injury - or even death			1
‘ add to this painting them black to camouflage them on the road shows a level of planning i find deeply distressing			0
’ rider @entity55 posted on @entity56 : ‘ @entity57 painted drawing pins scattered as sabotage on a fast descent is nothing less than attempted murder			1
’ the cyclists can be seen at the side of the road after cycling over the pins and puncturing their tyres in a video posted on @entity68 , several riders can be seen pitched up on the side of the road attempting to repair their punctures			2
mr @entity28 added that one cyclist he spoke with had five separate punctures			0
