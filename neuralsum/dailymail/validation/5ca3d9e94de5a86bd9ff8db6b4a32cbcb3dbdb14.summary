a 2,200 - year - old crossbow which some experts believe could have been almost twice as powerful as a modern - day assault rifle has been discovered among the @entity3			1
the crossbow , which was found intact this week , could have shot an arrow up to 2,600 feet - about the length of nine football pitches , the @entity6 reported			1
the discovery is particularly exciting as experts believe the crossbow may hold the secret to the success of @entity15 's first emperor , @entity14			1
discovery : this is the first ever crossbow to have survived intact found from the @entity18 uncovered : the bow is still half - buried next to one of @entity15 's famous terracotta warriors the crossbow , which was found half - buried next to one of the terracotta statues , was discovered by archaeologists working at the site			1
it is the first time archaeologists have seen a complete version of the weapon , although they previously found 10 more broken crossbows in the same pit			2
the bow measures almost five feet in length , with a height of about 50 inches			0
its size suggests that it was one of the most powerful bows of its era			0
historical texts indicate that its firing range could have been up to 2,600 feet , according to @entity44 , which is double the range of an assault rifle , which is about 1,300 feet			0
some historians believe that analysis of a number of historical texts shows that the crossbow was integral to several important military victories of the period			0
archaeological importance : many weapons have been found in the pits , like these ones from 2006 new : a ' @entity58 ' , an item which they had only read about in history books , was also discovered in the pit archaeologists are equally excited about the discovery of a ' @entity58 ' , an item which they had previously only read about in historical texts			1
the @entity58 helps explain how the crossbow was transported and stored , helping it to maintain its shape when not in use			2

@entity14 's colossal burial site in @entity92 , is thought to comprise some 8,000 life size human soldiers arranged in groups , plus other figures			2
the ancient site contains a collection of underground caverns containing everything the emperor would need for the afterlife , including reproductions of his armies , concubines , administrators and servants			0
the first of the life - size terracotta statues was unearthed in 1974 by farmers digging wells near @entity92 and a further 2,000 have been unearthed since			0
but the emperor â€™s burial mound has been left untouched because of fears a delicate artwork showing ancient beliefs of the afterlife , could be damaged using current archaeological methods			0
the site contained a poisonous mercury moat to keep out looters , and experts think further booby - traps await investigators inside the emperor 's chamber .			2
