by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 00:51 est , 23 april 2013 updated : 03:21 est , 23 april 2013 every one of the more than 180 people injured in the @entity6 blasts who made it to a hospital alive now seem likely to survive , doctors say			1
that includes several people who arrived with legs attached by just a little skin , a 3 - year - old boy with a head wound and bleeding on the brain , and a little girl riddled with nails			1
even a transit system police officer whose heart had stopped and was close to bleeding to death after a shootout with the suspects now appears headed for recovery			1
clarity amid confusion : miraculously , all of the injured people from the @entity30 were quickly treated on the scene and rushed to hospitals , allowing them to get the care they needed ' all i feel is joy , ' said dr. @entity36 , chief of trauma surgery at @entity38 , referring to his hospital 's 31 blast patients			1
' whoever came in alive , stayed alive			1
' three people did die in the blasts , but at the scene , before hospitals even had a chance to try to save them			1
a @entity49 police officer who police say was fatally shot thursday by the suspects was pronounced dead when he arrived at @entity38			2
the only person to reach a hospital alive and then die was one of the suspected bombers - 26 - year - old @entity55			1
but the remarkable , universal survival one week later of all others injured in the blasts is a testimonial to fast care at the scene , on the way to hospitals , then in emergency and operating rooms			2
help : the speed of first responders and volunteers on the scene helped save lives , like that of @entity72 who was seriously injured in one of the blasts everyone played a part , from doctors , nurses and paramedics to strangers who took off belts to use as tourniquets and staunched bleeding with their bare hands			1
as of monday , 51 people remained hospitalized , three of them in critical condition and five listed as serious			2
at least 14 people lost all or part of a limb ; three of them lost more than one			1
two children with leg injuries remain hospitalized at @entity93			0
a 7 - year - old girl is in critical condition and 11 - year - old @entity96 is in fair condition			0
the surviving bombing suspect , 19 - year - old @entity98 , is in serious condition at @entity100 with a neck wound			1
getting treatment : @entity104 firefighter @entity103 carried one of the more than 180 injured away from the scene triage care : many emergency workers and volunteers used the old - fashioned method of tourniquets to help stop the bleeding from severely injured limbs ' our training , our practicing , went a long way ' to minimizing chaos so that hospitals and emergency responders worked effectively to treat the many wounded , said dr. @entity122 , surgery chief at @entity123			1
' trauma care is optimism translated into action , ' said dr. @entity127 , chairman of surgery at @entity129 in @entity130 , where the wounded transit police officer , @entity131 , remains in stable but critical condition			2
doctors and emergency responders approach each patient as someone who can be saved regardless of how severe the injuries appear			2
and some were very bad			0
scars will remain : at least 14 people lost all or part of a limb ; three of them lost more than one ' the legs came hanging on muscles and skin , ' said @entity36 , who did three of the four initial amputations on patients in the early hours after the bombs at @entity38			1
a fifth patient at that hospital had to have an amputation thursday			2
doctors had judged that there was a 5 per cent chance the woman 's leg could be saved , so they did n't amputate right away			0
' we restored the blood supply to the leg , but all the muscles and nerves were destroyed , ' so the leg had to be removed later , he explained			0
resolve : a week after the fatal blasts , 51 people remained hospitalized , three of them in critical condition and five listed as serious of the remaining five patients at the hospital with severe leg injuries , ' i 'm very confident that they will all keep their legs , and even more , that they will have functional legs , ' he said			1
although doctors are optimistic , some patients still have life - threatening wounds			0
complications can range from blood clots to infections			0
a few still have injuries that could require amputation , said dr. @entity184 , a trauma surgeon at @entity100			0
' we have to see how these are going to heal ' over the next few weeks , he said			0
' blood supply is key			0
... the two biggest enemies we will face in the next two weeks are maintaining a good blood supply and preventing infection			0
' so far , the progress has been in the right direction			0
' every day they 're a little better , ' @entity184 said			0
' a lot of them have a long road of recovery ahead			0

doctors expect all of the more than 180 injured at the @entity6 bombing to survive
only person to reach the hospital alive and then die was the first bombing suspect , @entity55 , following his *altercation* with police
14 people lost part or all of a limb , and 3 people lost more than one limb
