by @entity0 published : 09:01 est , 31 october 2012 updated : 19:18 est , 31 october 2012 little more than half of @entity3 children still live with both their birth parents by the time they are 15 , according to shocking statistics on the breakdown of family life			2
eight out ten babies are born to couples living together , but that figure falls to just 55 per cent as they grow up			0
the figures were released as work and pensions secretary @entity13 announced plans to pay private firms and charities to help keep @entity3 ’s 120,000 problem families together			1
work and pensions secretary @entity13 today released figures showing how the percentage of children still living with both birth parents falls as children grew up			1
source : @entity24 , 2009 - 2010 he said the government would change the way it measures the success of social programmes for the poor , to make preventing the breakdown of family life the key yardstick			2
rather than simply recording how much money is thrown at the schemes , officials will have to log how they promote family stability , combat worklessness and whether children in the families affected perform as well their peers in other families			0
work and pensions secretary @entity13 used a speech today to say the government would intervene to stop parents splitting up companies will then be paid according to whether they improve those statistics in the 120,000 families identified as the cause of most anti-social behaviour in @entity3			1
calling family ‘ the most important building block in a child ’s life ’ , mr @entity13 made clear the government will prioritise keeping families together			1
in a speech yesterday at a @entity59 in @entity60 , he said : ‘ stable , loving families matter			0
they matter for this government , and they matter for the most vulnerable in society			2
‘ by measuring the proportion of children living with the same parents from birth and whether their parents report a good quality relationship we are driving home the message that social programmes should promote family stability and avert breakdown			1
’ he added : ‘ you do n’t help families by shrugging your shoulders when parental relationships fall apart			0
‘ when families are strong and stable , so are children – showing higher levels of wellbeing and more positive outcomes			0
but when things go wrong – either through family breakdown or a damaged parental relationship – the impact on a child ’s later life can be devastating			1
’ the government will also measure whether children from disadvantaged backgrounds do as well at school as other pupils and the percentage of young people who fall ‘ into a pattern of offending ’			2
a survey of offenders found 41 per cent had witnessed violence in their home as a child			0
other measures of success will focus on outcomes for those in treatment for addiction , and re-offending rates for those who have committed crime , recognising that such problems are often linked and overlapping			0
the proportion of benefit claimants who are able to work , but have been on out - of - work benefits for three out of the last four years will also be recorded to allow the government to ‘ concentrate efforts on reaching those for whom worklessness has become a way of life ’ , mr @entity13 said			1
figures released by the @entity128 yesterday show that of those currently on out - of - work benefits , 59 per cent , or around 2.5million individuals , have been claiming for at least 75 per cent of the four - year period			0
that means 2.5million have been on benefits for three out of the last four years			0
hailing the payment by results scheme , mr @entity13 said : ‘ because we are paying by results , we will only pay for what works - reducing the risk on the taxpayer and ensuring that every pound of government money is only being spent where it has a positive impact on people ’s lives			1

works and @entity150 warns of the ' devastating ' impact on youngsters when parents split up
@entity13 said the government would measure whether parents say they have a ' good quality relationship '
