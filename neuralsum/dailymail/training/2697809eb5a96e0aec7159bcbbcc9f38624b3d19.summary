@entity1 won the match 3 - 1 a club statement read : ' @entity1 can confirm that it has extended @entity0 's contract up to the end of @entity1 's season , enabling his participation in both domestic and @entity31 campaigns			1
' @entity0 has spent the first half of the season on a short - term deal at @entity1 after signing a pre-contract agreement with sister outfit @entity36 that was due to commence on january 1			1
the two clubs have now reached an agreement that allows the midfielder to remain in @entity40			0
he remains a contracted @entity1 player and is not at this moment associated with the @entity6 side			0
@entity0 celebrates after scoring for @entity1 in their win at @entity46 in mid-december it may be viewed as a blow to the credibility of the @entity51 enterprise as the needs of @entity40 appear to have been placed above the growth of @entity6 , after @entity0 was unveiled as one of their signature signings last summer			2
his exact starting date in @entity6 remains to be decided			0
on wednesday evening , @entity1 sources were not ruling out the possibility that @entity0 could yet return to @entity6 for the beginning of the @entity62 season in march or later on in @entity1 's season			1
for that to happen , the two clubs would have to agree a loan deal from @entity1 or a permanent transfer			0
it appears to be a possibility that remains open for discussion , although it seems most likely that @entity0 will remain in @entity40 as long as @entity69 believes he has a role to play at the club			2

on behalf of the @entity79 , we would like to publicly denounce @entity84 ’s and @entity0 ’s decision to extend his loan to @entity1 until the end of the @entity7 season			1
many fans , including our members , decided to support the team , committed to season tickets , and bought merchandise under the impression that @entity0 would be playing for @entity36 , not @entity1			1
many of those fans are rightly outraged by this decision , and we support any course of action they take to voice their discontent over this decision			0
our support for our ownership group has been unwavering until now , but this we can not support			0
we reject out of hand any suggestion that @entity36 is in any way secondary to @entity1 , regardless of the source , and are disappointed that @entity84 would give such an appearance			2
the @entity79 will forever act as a voice for the fans of @entity36 .			0
