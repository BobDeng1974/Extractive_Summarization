by @entity0 published : 12:16 est , 17 september 2012 updated : 05:25 est , 18 september 2012 starlight from eight billion years ago is set to be captured by the world 's most powerful digital camera			0
the ancient rays have crossed countless distant galaxies to find heir way to a mountaintop in @entity8 where a giant sky mapping machine called the @entity10 recorded them			1
the light may hold within it the answer to one of the biggest mysteries in physics - why the expansion of the universe is speeding up			1
although dark energy appears to account for about 75 % of the energy - mass content of the universe scientists have no real idea what it is			2
dark energy is arguably one of the major outstanding issues facing 21st - century science			0
this mysterious force appears to be accelerating the expansion of the @entity39			0
recognition of its existence and effect in 1998 earned three scientists a @entity45			0
the @entity10 ( @entity47 ) collaboration have announced the camera , which took eight years to build by scientists on three continents , has achieved first light			1
the first pictures of the southern sky were taken by the 570 - megapixel camera on 12 september			0
professor @entity55 , of @entity56 , who heads the @entity58 arm of the consortium , said : ' the achievement of first light through the @entity10 brings us a step closer to understanding dark energy , one of the biggest mysteries in the whole of physics			1
' the deep observations with the @entity47 camera will tell us why the universe is speeding up and if a major shift is required in our understanding of the universe			2
' the camera , which is roughly the size of a phone booth , is the most powerful survey instrument of its kind , able to see light from over 100,000 galaxies up to 8 billion light years away in each snapshot			0
the camera 's array of 62 devices have an unprecedented sensitivity to very red light and will allow scientists from around the world to pursue investigations ranging from studies of asteroids in our own solar system to the understanding of the origins and the fate of the universe			2
another test image from the @entity10 of the center of the globular star cluster @entity101 , which lies about 17,000 light years from @entity27 a zoomed - in image from the @entity10 of the center of the globular star cluster @entity101 , which lies about 17,000 light years from @entity27 scientists will use the new camera to carry out the largest galaxy survey ever undertaken , and will use that data to probe dark energy by studying galaxy clusters , supernovae and the large - scale clumping of galaxies			1
prof @entity112 , of @entity113 who co-coordinates the galaxy clustering part of the investigation , said : ' this will be the largest galaxy survey of its kind , and the galaxy shapes and positions will tell us a great deal about the nature of the physical process that we call @entity10 , but do not currently understand			1
' researcher prof @entity125 , of @entity126 , said : ' the construction of a 3 - dimensional map of the galaxies just based on their positions and optical colours is extremely challenging and will require sophisticated computational and statistical techniques			0
' the addition of galaxy near infrared colours from another @entity58 led sky mapping survey , the @entity133 , will greatly improve the accuracy of the map			0
' the @entity10 is expected to begin in december after the camera is fully tested and will take advantage of the excellent atmospheric conditions in the @entity143 to deliver pictures with the sharpest resolution seen in such a wide - field astronomy survey			1
over five years the survey will create detailed colour images of one - eighth of the sky , or 5,000 square degrees , to discover and measure 300 million galaxies , 100,000 galaxy clusters , and 4,000 supernovae			2
another image from the survey which was posted to the group 's facebook page			0
the @entity10 features 62 charged - coupled devices ( ccds ) , which record a total of 570 megapixels per snapshot			2
the @entity10 , mounted on the @entity165 telescope in @entity8			1

images are first to be released from the @entity10 in @entity8
could hold clues to why the universe is *expanding* at a *faster* rate than expected
