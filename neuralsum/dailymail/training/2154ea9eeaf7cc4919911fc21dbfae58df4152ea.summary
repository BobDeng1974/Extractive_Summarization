@entity0 experienced the unfamiliar feeling of returning from a @entity2 without a gold medal as @entity4 failed to win a title for the first time since 2001			1
after two silver medals in the opening four days of competition in @entity8 , near @entity9 - both in the team pursuits on day two - all hopes turned to @entity14 in the six - discipline omnium			1
but the five - time world champion and double @entity18 gold medallist was playing catch up after placing 13th in the opening scratch race on saturday and finished well adrift of @entity22 's @entity21			1
@entity0 ( left ) smiles for the cameras with her omnium silver from the @entity2 but says she was ' gutted ' to have finished behind @entity22 's @entity21 ( centre ) @entity14 was the last hope for @entity4 to claim the team 's first gold medal of the titles held near @entity9 @entity4 had one last opportunity in the men 's @entity31 , a non-olympic discipline and track cycling 's equivalent of the wacky races , but a commendable effort from @entity38 and @entity39 went unrewarded			1
it means @entity4 , the once dominant nation of track cycling , have three silver medals from the penultimate @entity2 prior to the @entity43			1
@entity4 last failed to win a gold in @entity45 in 2001 , while this was their smallest haul since the @entity49 in @entity50 , when they won one medal of each colour			1
@entity14 , beaten in the team pursuit for the first time at her fifth @entity2 , was ' gutted ' after missing out on the rainbow jerseys she coveted			1
but the 22 - year - old from @entity60 vowed to ' come back flying at the next worlds , ' which take place in @entity64 next march , after a third successive world silver in cycling 's equivalent of the heptathlon			2
@entity14 's silver meant @entity70 went without a gold medal for the first time at a @entity2 since 2001 @entity14 ( right ) competes in the final of the women 's omnium event , cycling 's equivalent of the heptathlon she said : ' @entity64 's massive , is n't it ? it 's going to be a home crowd , a home track			1
it will be about performing there			2
' i 've always tended to perform in front of a home crowd			2
that will be a massive target for me			2
' olympic champion @entity90 , @entity14 's fiance , would have been expected to be in contention in the sprint , won by @entity93 of @entity94 on sunday , but exited in the first round on saturday			0
@entity14 said : ' i feel sorry for him			0
i guess he just got a bit unlucky			0
' he 's a bit disappointed			0
we 'd rather they happen now than in a year and a half 's time			2
' @entity14 attempts to get on the wheel of the event 's winner , @entity21 , during the points race @entity90 's exit piled expectation on @entity14 , who won world and @entity112 omnium gold in 2012			1
asked if she felt the pressure of delivering @entity4 's first gold , she added : ' a little bit			1
i tend to try to put that to the back of my mind			0
i 'll try my hardest no matter what , whether i was winning or whether i was last , i would 've tried my best			0
' @entity14 resumed on sunday in third after winning the second and third disciplines , the three - kilometres individual pursuit and the elimination race			0
she moved up to second after placing fifth in the fourth discipline , the 500metres time - trial , and was third in the penultimate discipline , the flying lap. but @entity21 won both disciplines to take a 14 - point lead into the concluding points race			2
@entity14 speeds around the track at @entity94 's @entity135 during the flying lap on sunday instead of chasing gold , @entity14 found her silver medal position under threat from @entity140 , but she finished behind the @entity141 on the final sprint to cling on to second overall			1
@entity21 finished with 192 points , @entity14 with 176 and @entity145 with 175			0
@entity14 added : ' you 've always got a target on your back once you have won			0
people do n't let you move as freely as you 'd like to			0
' i definitely think it is harder to stay at the top			0
hats off to people like sir @entity155 ( @entity156 )			0
' @entity156 won 11 world titles and six olympic gold medals , but since his retirement in april 2013 , @entity4 's aura of invincibility has slipped			1
@entity14 's team pursuit squad lost for the first time since december 2010 , ending the run of four straight world titles			1
@entity70 had high hopes for @entity14 's fiance @entity90 ( left ) but he left the championships disappointed the usually indefatigable @entity14 admitted the exertions of the team pursuit - where @entity171 was under - par - affected her in the omnium			1
she added : ' the team pursuit is 4k and three rounds			0
having to do three rides with three riders for a lot of it , and then having to do a whole omnium , i actually found that pretty hard			2
' @entity38 and @entity181 , who was a late replacement for the ill @entity183 , won the @entity31 at @entity64 's @entity184 last december			0
the pair took a lap early on to lead but , roared on by a partisan crowd , @entity94 pair @entity185 and @entity186 won gold by one point from @entity192 and @entity38 and @entity181 finished ninth			2
@entity193 was hampered by overnight illness as she missed out on advancing to the semi-finals of the women 's @entity196 , won by @entity22 's @entity198 .			0

@entity0 came second in the omnium at the @entity49
@entity4 claimed just three silver medals at the titles held near @entity9
it is the first time since 2001 that @entity70 has failed to win a gold @entity206
