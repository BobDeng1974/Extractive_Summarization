when @entity2 was diagnosed with cancer at five months pregnant her doctors quickly advised her to have an abortion			1

yesterday she said : ‘ i was always determined to have my baby			2
i felt such a close bond with her , i could n’t let her go			2
’ aborting her child was never an option because of her strong faith , miss @entity2 insisted			1
she was diagnosed with lung cancer after she fell ill on a camping trip with her partner of five years , @entity34 , 22			1
for several months she had been having breathing problems but her condition got out of control when she went down with a fever on the break near @entity40			2

the life - saving operation took place four weeks later and saw the removal of half of her lung			1
now recovering at home , she says she wants to tell her story so that others realise that a disease like lung cancer can affect anyone – even young non-smokers like herself			2
doctors said the onset of cancer in the case of @entity44 , who comes from @entity88 , was more likely to be caused by genetics rather than any lifestyle factors			2
