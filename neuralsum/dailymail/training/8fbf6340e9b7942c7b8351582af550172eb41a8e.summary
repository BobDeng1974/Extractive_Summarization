i never thought i ’d say this but i actually feel sorry for @entity2			1
for years and years , sir @entity4 ran the referees , the clocks and the rules , but now that ’s all gone			0
it surely ca n’t be a conscious thing from referees , but does n’t it look to you as if @entity2 are now being punished for that ? they were comfortable against @entity16 on sunday			1
when they went 3 - 1 in front you wondered how many goals they would rack up at the @entity21			1
@entity25 ( left ) , @entity22 ( centre ) and @entity24 show their dejection at @entity16 @entity2 boss @entity28 ( centre ) looks at the ground as he watches his side lose to @entity16 former @entity2 manager sir @entity4 gestures towards his watch during his time in charge but inexplicably @entity35 saw fit to completely ignore @entity36 ’ striker @entity37 bulldozing into @entity2 full back @entity38			1
and to compound such a terrible error , @entity35 chose to give a penalty when @entity38 breathed on @entity37 ’s back in the box			2
@entity35 ca n’t give one and not the other			2
dreadful decision making from a referee who seems to have had a common sense bypass operation in the summer			1
he was n’t great at the @entity50 the week before			0
@entity2 ’s defending from then on was appalling and they collapsed way too easily			2
but the main reason the game turned around so dramatically was the momentum @entity16 gained from such a woeful refereeing decision			1
in some ways , they only realised they could win the game when they felt the referee was on their side			0
@entity22 ( left ) complains to referee @entity35 during the match at the @entity21 on sunday @entity37 celebrates after scoring @entity16 's fourth goal in their win over @entity2 the @entity21 scoreboard shows the score as @entity16 pick up a famous victory @entity16 ’s fight will rightly be applauded			1
but @entity37 ’s blatant dive for that first penalty will be ignored because it does n’t fit the script of the underdog ’s incredible comeback against the expensive giants			0
@entity16 are the kind of side who never give up – they ’ve finally shaken off their ' chokers ' tag after securing promotion last season			2
and i ’ve enjoyed watching them this season - they ’ve brought some adventure to the @entity86 , and they ’re doing it with players from @entity89 , lower league and through their own ranks			1
so let ’s respect how they powered on to win the game in spectacular fashion			0
without that ridiculous penalty decision though , you wonder where they would have found the belief they needed			0
@entity102 celebrates after scoring @entity16 's fifth goal from the penalty spot @entity2 have suffered in other games this season : a @entity108 defender virtually caught the ball in the area towards the end of the goalless draw at @entity113 , yet no penalty was given			1
i know there are a large number of football fans who do n’t like @entity2 : they will see this as karma for all the years of @entity4 seemingly running things			0
they will also find it very funny			0
like our @entity2 facebook page here			0
@entity125 gave the game away - @entity127			0

@entity2 lost 5 - 3 to @entity16 in the @entity86 on sunday
you wondered how many goals @entity2 would score when they went 3 - 1 up
referee @entity35 made some dreadful decision - making
@entity16 gained momentum from @entity137 's woeful decision
