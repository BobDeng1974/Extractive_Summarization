by @entity0 , mail online deputy political editor @entity5 's deputy leader @entity4 will tonight claim @entity2 sidelined her because she was a woman			1
in a speech on sexism in @entity9 she will claim that a man would not have ' put up ' with not being made deputy prime minister after she won the battle to be @entity5 's number two in 2007			1
she will also reveal how mr @entity2 relegated her to a dinner for leaders ' wives at a major summit			1
@entity2 , pictured at the @entity5 conference in 2009 , appears to have angered @entity5 's deputy leader @entity4 by not making her deputy prime minister but the claims were immediately dismissed as ' utter bilge ' by mr @entity2 's former spin doctor @entity22 , who suggested the @entity5 deputy leader was ' useless '			1
ms @entity4 was elected as the party 's deputy leader in 2007 , the same year mr @entity2 became prime minister			1

she is expected to say : ' imagine my surprise when having won a hard - fought election to succeed @entity33 as deputy leader of the @entity5 , i discovered that i was not to succeed him as deputy prime minister			2
' if one of the men had won the deputy leadership would that have happened ? would they have put up with it ? i doubt it			0
mr @entity2 's former spin doctor @entity22 dismissed miss @entity4 's claims as ' utter bilge ' ' and imagine the consternation in my office when we discovered that my involvement in the @entity49 summit was inclusion at the no 10 dinner for the @entity49 leaders ' wives			1

he insisted that former business minister @entity68 had been given a ' vital role ' at the @entity49 summit in 2009			0
' as every man and woman who ever worked for him could attest , @entity2 judged people on only one thing : were they useless or not , ' he said on @entity75			1
' @entity68 was given a crucial role to play at the @entity49 not cos of her position but cos she could make a crucial contribution whereas someone like me had no contribution to make to the summit so i was put in charge of media for the spouses			0
