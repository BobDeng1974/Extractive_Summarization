shouted down : the @entity8 chief @entity7 , who so vocally demanded that mayor @entity9 apologize to the @entity4 after showing what they called police bias following the @entity14 decision , bore the brunt of the ire when a uni9on meeting devolved into chaos tuesday ' my members want : they want more cars , better vests , more manpower , ' shouted a cop , according to @entity25 sources			1
' they do n't want an apology			2
' as other cops jumped in to back up @entity7 , it was cop against cop and shouting and shoving continued for at least the next ten minutes			1
the officers also demanded that @entity7 tell them what was discussed in a closed door meeting he had with @entity9 december 30			1
@entity7 refused to divulge details			1
' he did n't want to talk about it , ' a source told @entity25			2
' he said , " everything we say gets back to the media			1
" he was just refusing to answer			2
he said , " it is what it is			2
" ' before the meeting could erupt into fisticuffs , @entity7 adjourned and slipped out			1
some even claimed afterwards that the chaos was all staged by union reps eager to run against @entity7 in the next union election			1
new statistics show that @entity4 officers are starting to make more arrests after a suspected work slowdown at the start of the year that further exposed tensions between the rank and file and mayor @entity9 , officials said monday			0
scene : @entity77 's banquet hall in @entity78 devolved into chaos tuesday as union reps shouted down their leader @entity7 , saying demands for apologies from mayor @entity9 are n't enough at a news conference , police commissioner @entity85 said the 4,690 arrests made last week across the city were still down significantly - 37 percent compared with the same period last year			1
but it was an improvement compared with the 2,401 arrests in the week ending january 4 , which had represented about a 60 percent drop			0
' with each passing day , with each passing week , those numbers are going back up to what we would describe as normal			1
... the cops are beginning to do what 's expected of them , ' @entity85 said			2
ticketing for traffic and parking violations and other low - level infractions , which had virtually ground to a halt , also were starting to edge upward , officials said			0
and despite the apparent slowdown , reports of homicides and other serious crimes also were down in the first two weeks of 2015 , they added			0
@entity107 officials , who met behind closed doors with @entity85 last week , have denied the dramatic decline in enforcement reflected a sanctioned work stoppage			0
but the numbers were seen as evidence of growing rancor between police officers and @entity9 in the aftermath of the slayings of two patrolmen , and prompted @entity85 to put commanders on notice that they needed to step up enforcement activity			0
the two officers were killed dec. 20 in a brazen daytime ambush by a mentally unstable man who vowed online to kill two ' pigs ' in retaliation for the deaths of black men and boys at the hands of police around the country			0
police unions have accused @entity9 of contributing to anti-police sentiment by supporting protests over the police killings			0
cops at the tuesday meeting demanded to know what the union planned to do to ' protect them			1
' here , some @entity143 police officers turn away from a large screen displaying @entity143 mayor @entity9 as he speaks during the funeral of officer @entity147 the shooting deaths of officers @entity147 ( right ) and ( left ) @entity149 have served as a counter argument as the police unions fight off criticism of @entity4 brutality earlier monday , @entity9 said he was confident that police officials were taking the proper steps to ensure public safety and to reverse the downward trend in arrests			0
' by definition , every public servant needs to do their job , ' the mayor said			0
' but i think , in the interest of moving us forward , they have taken the right approach , and we 're seeing good results			0
' @entity7 , president of the powerful @entity8 and one of the mayor 's harshest critics , declined to comment through a spokesman			1
continued concerns over the rift come as department also is taking precautions in response to the terrorist attack in @entity180 and reports of a renewed threat from the @entity184 group			0
police officials said that in the wake of the @entity180 killings , someone using an @entity188 account posted a propaganda video calling for the killing of ' intelligence officers , police officers , soldiers , and civilians ' in the @entity197 - a message that mirrored one in september			0
the threat prompted the @entity4 to send out a new safety alert advising officers working in pairs on fixed posts in patrol cars to make sure one stands outside of the car to keep an eye out for threats against them , and to beef up security at several sensitive locations			0
despite the precautions , the @entity4 had ' no information about any specific , credible threat to @entity143 driven by these events , ' @entity213 , the department 's top counterterrorism official , said monday			0
unarmed @entity143 @entity14 was choked to death by a police officer last year , sparking major criticism of the @entity4 the @entity14 case sparked widespread protests			0
but as citizens demanded police be held accountable in such situations , the unions have spoken out on the need for police to be protected			1

@entity8 head @entity7 was caught in the cross hairs of angry cops tuesday
some cried that they had no use for apologies and demanded to know how they *'d* be protected
others *barked* back in support of the union chief and the @entity2 banquet hall turned into an ugly scene of cops shoving cops as @entity7 slipped out
