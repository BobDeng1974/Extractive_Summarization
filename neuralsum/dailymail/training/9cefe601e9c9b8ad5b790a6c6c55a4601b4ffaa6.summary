the reported @entity1 hack , which exposed hundreds of photos of celebrities , has highlighted the dangers of storing files online			2
in particular , actress @entity6 complained she had deleted a number of the leaked photos ‘ long ago ’			0
but , many @entity10 users are n’t aware that removing a photo from a device does n’t automatically remove it from their cloud account			1
if you are concerned about images or files you have stored online , there are steps you can take to delete them from the @entity1 and from the device			1
if my @entity31 is enabled ( pictured left ) , these photos are also stored in the @entity34 album ( pictured right ) , which is automatically uploaded to @entity1 and other synced devices deleting photos from the @entity31 automatically removes them from @entity1			1
my photo @entity38 can also be disabled in @entity39 , @entity1 , @entity40 ( pictured ) users can also stop photos automatically being uploaded to @entity1 , so that future snaps are n’t vulnerable either			1
when a user takes a photo on an @entity48 , @entity49 or @entity47 , it is stored in their @entity25			2
this is a gallery of images that are physically stored on the device the photo was taken on			2
this also includes photos that have been saved from text messages , emails and websites			0
by comparison , the @entity34 album is in the cloud and syncs will all other connected devices			0
if my @entity31 is enabled , when a photo is taken and saved on the @entity25 , it is saved in the @entity34 album and automatically saved to @entity1			1
this means that particular image is synced with every connected device , and will appear those devices ' @entity69 as well			0
if the @entity34 album does n't appear , the tool has n't been activated , or there is n’t an @entity1 account connected to that device			0
photos can also be stored on @entity1 if a user chooses to back up their @entity25 to the cloud service			1
to remove these images a person must overwrite them with a new backup			0
this involves moving the images from the @entity48 or @entity49 to another device - such as a laptop - and then deleting them from the @entity25 on the phone or tablet			1
next time the phone is backed up , the existing @entity25 backup will be replaced with the new one , which should have fewer , or no images in it			1
photos are also stored on @entity1 if a user backs up the @entity25 ( left )			1
to remove these images , overwrite them with a new backup			0
this involves moving images from the @entity48 to another device , deleting them from the @entity25 on the phone or tablet , overwriting the backup , and deselecting the @entity25 option ( right ) it is possible for users to enhance the security of their documents by turning off @entity108 on their device when they are not using it			1
they can also turn on two - step verification for their @entity113 tool prevents people accessing accounts - even if they have the password			0
to set up two - step verification , go to my @entity10 @entity118 manage your @entity10 id and sign in , then select @entity122			0
under two - step verification , select get started and follow the onscreen instructions			0
when a user sets up two - step verification , they register one or more trusted @entity128 trusted device is one that can receive 4 - digit verification codes using either @entity131 or @entity132			0
alternatively , @entity25 backup options can be disabled by going to go to @entity134 and @entity135			1
select the device and turn off @entity25 backup			2
if enabled , backup occurs automatically when the device is synced with @entity140 , or when it ’s put on charge and connected to @entity143			2
images on @entity31 only stay on the @entity1 server for 30 days , and the device will only store 1,000 @entity31 images			1
after this point , the photos are automatically deleted			0
to remove them sooner , open @entity31 , select the images that need to be removed , and delete them			2
this will delete them from the device and @entity1 , but also any other devices that the stream has been shared with , or is connected to the same @entity156 , such as friends or family members			0
users can also disable @entity31 by switching it off in @entity134 , @entity1 , @entity40			0
be aware that when a photo is deleted from the @entity25 , it is not deleted from the devices my @entity31 album , and therefore is not automatically deleted from @entity1 .			1

when photos are taken on @entity10 devices , they *'re* stored in the @entity25
if @entity31 is enabled , these images are also stored on @entity1
@entity25 photos are only uploaded to the cloud if the option is enabled as part of the phone or tablet ’s backup options
removing a photo from @entity25 does not remove it from the backup - the photos need to be deleted from the device , and the backup overwritten
but , deleting it from @entity31 automatically deletes it from @entity1
