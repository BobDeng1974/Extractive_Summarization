by @entity0 a couple are horrified after finding a dead shrew at the bottom of a crisp packet destined for their son 's lunchbox			1
@entity8 and @entity9 found the rodent after eating their way through a large pack of lightly - salted @entity14 that had been delivered to their home in the @entity17 , @entity18			1
mr @entity19 , 34 , said : ' we bought some lightly - salted flavoured @entity14 and they were delivered with our @entity24 ’s shopping to our house			1
according to @entity14 's investigations , the shrew had not been in the packet for long before it was found ' we started to eat the crisps and ate the first half of the bag			1
@entity9 was going to split the rest of them for a packed lunch			0
but we were absolutely horrified to find a mouse in the bottom			0
' we ’d been going to put the crisps with my nine - year - old son @entity39 ’s lunch ' @entity19 had already eaten half of the packet , with his wife @entity9 , before they found the dead rodent mr @entity19 immediately rang @entity14 @entity46 and said the company asked him to send a photograph and also to put the ' foreign body ' in an envelope and post it to them			1
however , within moments of the photograph being sent , the company rang to say a courier would collect the mouse			1
a spokeswoman for @entity14 said : ' we take food safety and quality very seriously and have stringent systems and procedures in place to ensure that every bag of @entity64 reaches our consumers in perfect condition			2
' we have been consulting with mrs @entity9 since this issue came to light yesterday			0
we received the pack last night and have today sought independent advice from an expert @entity71			0
' from this we have ascertained that the dead animal is a shrew , and due to its appearance in the bag it would seem to have been dead for a relatively short period of time			2
' our investigations so far indicate that the shrew did not enter the bag at @entity14 , or during distribution , and therefore we need to understand how it came to be associated with our product			2
' naturally we are taking this issue seriously and will be undertaking further work to ascertain how this situation came about			0
' we fully understand the anxiety that this has caused to @entity19 and mrs @entity9 and we will continue to liaise directly with them			0
