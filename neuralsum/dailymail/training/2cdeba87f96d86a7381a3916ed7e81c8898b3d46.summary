for a @entity2 manager , there is never really a honeymoon period			1
@entity4 probably realised that as soon as his team lost their opening game of the @entity9 season to @entity10 at @entity11			1
as @entity2 prepare to return to action at @entity14 on monday , however , it is hard to escape the feeling that their season , to all intents and purposes , starts now			1
the first thing @entity21 did when he arrived at @entity11 was to ask for time and that was reasonable			2
the squad he inherited from @entity26 lacked balance , he stressed , and he was right			0
this was a dressing room , for example , that had more no 10s than @entity11 bus depot			2
@entity2 have been patchy and scratchy			2
their last two home wins in the league – 2 - 1 against @entity42 and @entity43 – could easily have been draws			0
however , there has been improvement from early season struggles and as @entity9 football returns again this weekend @entity2 sit fourth , back in the @entity49 positions for the first time in a long time			1
certainly there is opportunity for @entity53 as they look forwards			0
a tilt at the @entity9 title is maybe beyond them – that already looks like a two - horse race – but with expected top four rivals such as @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity43 and @entity64 already experiencing problems of their own there is no reason why a fit and functioning @entity2 team should not do enough to ensure they are back in @entity71 ’s blue riband competition next season			2
perhaps we will learn much over the next two - and - half weeks			0
by the time the next international break begins @entity2 will have faced @entity14 , @entity74 , @entity75			1
former @entity2 captain @entity76 said this week : ' we 'll find out about @entity2 in the next few weeks as the @entity14 , @entity74 and @entity75 games are all massive ones			1
' we 'll find out exactly the level where the team is at this season			0
' we 've not really played anybody really strong yet			0
' i know @entity43 at home could be classed as being a tough game but , in terms of really tough matches , @entity74 and @entity75 will provide a real measure of where this team is at			1
' @entity91 celebrates scoring @entity2 's winner against @entity43 at @entity11 @entity2 will soon have to face high - flying @entity74 and their star striker @entity93 ( above ) @entity2 1 - 2 @entity10 @entity94 1 - 1 @entity2 @entity95 4 - 0 @entity2 @entity96 0 - 0 @entity2 @entity2 4 - 0 @entity97 @entity98 5 - 3 @entity2 @entity2 2 - 1 @entity42 @entity2 2 - 1 @entity43 @entity2 certainly have the firepower to trouble any team now			1
the attacking players @entity21 has at his disposal could have been taken straight from somebody ’s fantasy football team			0
further to that , @entity21 should now see the defensive injury crisis that has plagued his early season efforts begin to ease and with midfielder @entity109 closer to a first - team return after ankle trouble there is every reason why the @entity115 coach should see improvement			1
' we 've shown glimpses over the last few weeks and hopefully we 'll have a lot of players coming back for these next games , ' confirmed @entity2 assistant manager @entity35 on thursday			1
' these are the games you want to be involved in and play in			0
and they will be a test			0
experienced midfielder @entity109 ( centre ) is due to return to fitness soon @entity14 ( a ) october 20 @entity74 ( h ) october 26 @entity75 ( a ) november 2 @entity128 ( h ) november 8 ' @entity74 have probably been the standout team so far with @entity75 just behind them and we want to be up there testing ourselves against those teams			1
' we feel that we do belong up there but we perhaps have n't shown it consistently this season			0
' the form has slowly begun to get better and better and we want to hit form going into those matches			0
' as anyone who watches them knows , @entity2 ’s season has been categorised by two stark opposites			2
their attacking play has been excellent at times while their defending has been modest at best			0
as @entity21 has pointed out himself , the responsibility for defending lies with the whole team and , by extension , the coach himself			0
@entity148 has been a revelation since moving to @entity11 from @entity150 in a £ 60million move @entity2 continue to have problems keeping the ball and in the absence of @entity109 and @entity155 – also fit again now – there has been no midfield shield to protect @entity21 ’s back four when his team lose the ball			1
if this aspect of @entity2 ’s play does not improve against the two favourites for the league title in the coming weeks then it is hard to see them taking anything from the games			1
equally , @entity2 need to find a way to improve in the last half an hour of matches			2
startling statistics reveal that they have not scored a goal beyond the 62nd minute of any game this season but have conceded eight in that time			0
@entity21 knows he still has plenty to do before @entity2 return to their glory days @entity21 may dismiss that as a co-incidence and would certainly rail against any notion that his team is n’t fit enough			2
however , it ’s a statistic that has damaged @entity2 hugely so far this season			2
if they can put that right against @entity14 , @entity74 and @entity75 over the next 16 days then the winter will begin to look rather less dark			1
@entity187 not out of the question - @entity189			0

@entity4 has been at @entity2 for three months
