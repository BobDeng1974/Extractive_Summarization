@entity6 striker @entity0 struck twice inside four minutes to grab the @entity7 a cushion going in to the break at @entity10			2
the hosts managed just one shot in the opening 45 , but grabbed a route back into the game when @entity16 netted just after the break			1
however , it was a case of too little too late for @entity4 as they failed to break through a stubborn @entity2 defence			1
@entity22 's @entity21 was at the game to give the lowdown ... @entity0 celebrates scoring @entity2 's first goal against @entity4 in the @entity26 on saturday @entity4 ( 4 - 1 - 4 - 1 ) @entity27 6 – @entity28 had little chance with either of the @entity2 goals but otherwise looked solid behind a makeshift defence			1
@entity32 6.5 – sound defensively , getting in a good early block on @entity34 , and launched the attack for @entity4 ’s goal with a lovely nutmeg @entity38 and @entity32 do battles as both vie for the ball during the battle at @entity10 @entity43 6.5 – pressed into action as an emergency centre - back in the absence of @entity47 , and the full - back coped well on the whole			2
@entity50 5.5 - ca n’t claim to have come off best in his duel with @entity0 and was too busy trying to wrestle the @entity6 when he headed in the second			2
@entity53 5.5 – first touch let him down on a couple of occasions , not least when he ended up conceding the freekick that led to @entity2 ’s first goal @entity4 's @entity60 striker @entity59 vies for the ball with @entity2 defender @entity62 @entity63 5 – guilty of playing @entity65 into trouble on the first goal , and looked vulnerable at times			1
replaced by @entity68 with 20 minutes left @entity16 7 – stylish finish to get @entity4 back in the game and went close to an equaliser with a flick header			1
@entity74 5.5 – had his moments but tended to drift in and out of the game			0
a little better in the second half			0
@entity78 6 – another one who struggled to make an impact			0
should have done better than poke an effort straight at @entity82 from eight yards out in the 60th minute			0
@entity78 gets to grips with @entity2 midfielder @entity83 during the match at @entity10 @entity85 7 – really came alive in the second half and did well to pick out @entity16 for the @entity4 goal			1
@entity87 7 – an isolated figure in the first half but had more support after the interval and went close with a wonderful curling effort			0
subs : @entity68 ( @entity94 72 ) , @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity98 ( for @entity99 89 ) , @entity100 , @entity101			0
scorer : @entity16 48 booked : none @entity16 of @entity4 scores to halve the deficit against @entity2 in the @entity26 match @entity2 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) @entity107 7 – kicked the ball more than he handled it in the first half such was the lack of threat from @entity4 , but called upon to make some important saves after half - time			1
@entity115 6 – like the rest of @entity2 ’s defence , coasted through the first half but ended up hanging on towards the end			2
rarely put a foot wrong though			0
@entity120 6 – one of three changes from the @entity123 game in midweek and looked solid enough on his return to the line - up			0
@entity127 of @entity2 is tackled by @entity16 of @entity4 during the @entity26 match @entity127 6.5 – dealt comfortably with @entity59 in the first half but more of a battle after that , and got a punch in the back of the head from @entity82 for his troubles			1
@entity135 5.5 – strolled through the first half but had his hands full after that as @entity138 and @entity59 stepped up their game			0
@entity140 7 – did well snuffing out any trouble in midfield and spilt blood for the cause after a bang in the face , ending the game in a blank shirt			0
@entity2 's @entity150 striker @entity34 vies for the ball with @entity4 's @entity78 @entity152 7 – wasted an early chance when he was guilty of a heavy first touch but kept things over nicely and orchestrated many of @entity2 ’s best moves			1
@entity34 6 – couple of sublime touches but subdued by his standards and replaced by @entity161 towards the end			0
@entity83 6.5 – picked up two more assists as he delivered the set - pieces for both @entity0 ’s goals			2
otherwise , the @entity166 was effective without ever setting the game alight			0
@entity38 6.5 – got the flick - on for @entity0 ’s first goal but had few opportunities himself			2
never stopped driving at the @entity4 defence			2
@entity38 hitches a ride on the back of @entity4 's @entity6 ace @entity16 at @entity10 @entity0 8 – scored both @entity2 ’s goals , making it eight in six against @entity4			1
they will be glad to see the back of the @entity6 for another season			0

@entity0 scored twice in four first - half minutes to give @entity2 lead
@entity2 *dominated* the opening half as hosts *mustered* just one shot
@entity4 improved second half and scored via @entity16
but it was a case of too little too late despite *dominating* the second half
