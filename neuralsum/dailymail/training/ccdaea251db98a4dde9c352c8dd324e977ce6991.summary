sex and film by @entity1 there was breathless excitement when an immensely raunchy , bestselling novel was adapted for the screen , with overwrought cinema - goers queuing in their droves to see it			1
but this was not @entity11			1
this was @entity13 , in 1921			0
and it starred @entity15 , whose sex appeal was such that when he died only five years later , aged just 31 , some of his more committed female fans responded to the news by killing themselves			1
the history of sex on the big screen is about as old as the cinema itself			1
@entity1 brings it wham , bam up to date , with analyses both of @entity11 and a much franker , darker exploration of sexual deviancy , @entity31 ’s alarming 2013 film @entity32			1
but for me , the real gems in this formidably well - researched and erudite book concern the earlier manifestations of sex on - screen			1
or off - screen , in the case of @entity13 , in which a wryly unambiguous caption , ‘ after a week of sullen obedience			2
’ , told audiences that @entity15 ’s desert predator had finally had his wicked way with the headstrong @entity48			0
like @entity11 , the book itself was rather less coy			1
the depiction of sex in the cinema has changed hugely over the years , the @entity52 film industry was notoriously cautious about what was shown - @entity57 pictured in a poster for @entity59 by the @entity61 , coyness was being forced onto @entity62 by increasingly vigilant censors , the so - called @entity63			1
the @entity65 jungle was deemed far enough from ‘ civilisation ’ to be permitted some erotic freedom in @entity68 ( 1932 ) , in which @entity69 and @entity70 wore skimpy outfits , which , from some angles , made them appear naked			0
but then , the censors pounced			0
and by the next film in the series , they had ‘ modestly covered @entity75 and @entity57 in almost comically baggy costumes ’			0
unsurprisingly , it was randy @entity78 who introduced sex to @entity62			2
in @entity83 , a @entity82 film of 1933 , a young @entity80 is shown in obvious post-orgasmic bliss			0
the film was duly seized by @entity86 and prosecuted for obscenity			0
but @entity52 could n’t keep out @entity88 , and they had their own sex goddess in the hourglass form of naughty @entity92 , who had her own way of outfoxing the morality police			1
in i ’m @entity96 ( 1933 ) , she saucily adjusts her gown and then purrs , ‘ am i making myself clear , boys ? ’ there was nothing censorable about the line , but nothing wholesome , either			0
not much did get past the @entity63 — including @entity104 ’s cleavage in @entity105 ( 1945 ) , the first @entity107 film to be cut before @entity52 audiences were allowed to see it			1
@entity1 suggests the censors were so distracted by @entity57 ’s gravity - defying embonpoint in @entity59 ( 1943 ) that they missed distinct hints of homoeroticism elsewhere in the film			2
today , the restrictions — no horizontal embraces , no ‘ excessive ’ kissing , no suggestion of intercourse outside marriage — seem comical			0
in @entity122 ( 1942 ) , there could be no hint of a ‘ sex affair ’ between @entity125 and @entity126 , so audiences had to decide for themselves what he meant when he said : ‘ we ’ll always have @entity130			2
’ memories of an outing up the @entity133 ? probably not			0
in the @entity135 and @entity136 , such strictures began to crumble — not that the ‘ sex comedies ’ starring @entity140 and @entity143 were anything other than irreproachably conservative , prompting comedian @entity139 to say that he ’d known @entity140 ‘ before she was a virgin ’			2
even in @entity107 , old censorship habits died hard , with county councils allowed to overrule certificates dished out by the @entity147 , as several did with @entity148 ( 1960 ) , on the grounds that @entity151 ’s priapic , working - class hero was an affront to the reputation of decent factory workers			2
throughout cinematic history , of course , the greater the puritanical outrage generated by a film , the more people have wanted to see it			0
that was notably so of @entity163 ’s film @entity162 ( 1972 ) , starring @entity167 — and it also ‘ possibly helped the sales of a certain kitchen commodity utilised as a sexual lubricant ’			0
but @entity170 only pushed at certain boundaries , and obeyed the unwritten law that female nudity is more acceptable than male			0
the tumescent penis to this day is not often seen in mainstream cinema ( indeed , in @entity11 , @entity176 ’s @entity175 seems to have no genitalia at all )			1
@entity1 offers one good explanation : limp apparatus in a sex scene would give the game away — the game being the many cameramen , boom operators and make - up artists who , by all accounts , make genuine arousal on a film set a near - impossibility			1
@entity1 ’s book is a work of scholarship , not gossip , but that does n’t stop him dropping mischievous references to the rampant ironies yielded by more than a century of sex on the screen			1
the thoroughly chaste @entity201 ( 1945 ) is often cited by moralists as a perfect example of how romance can be depicted without sex , but @entity1 notes gleefully that the film ’s director , @entity206 , was well - known for his energetic promiscuity , and its writer , @entity209 , for his homosexuality			1
an acquaintance of mine told me years ago that he ’d once checked in at the @entity213 in @entity214 behind @entity209 and his long - time companion , @entity215 , and that @entity209 startled the stiff , @entity217 receptionist by fruitily announcing himself and @entity215 as ‘ mr and mrs @entity209 ’			2
his was a very different world to that of @entity201			0
but then , sex on screen — or the lack of it — has always unfolded in a parallel universe			2
that ’s the magic of the movies .			0

the depiction of sex on the big screen has changed hugely over the years
censorship in @entity52 cinema was notoriously restrictive
in his new book @entity1 explores @entity11 and others
