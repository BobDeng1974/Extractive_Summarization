for children born with a rare genetic condition that makes their skin so delicate it can break into agonizing blisters at even the slightest tough , every day is a constant struggle with suffering few can understand , both physical and social			1
@entity6 's son @entity5 was born in 2009 with only a small blister on his head			2
she later learned he suffered from @entity9 or ' @entity10 , ' so named because the skin is as fragile as an insect 's wing , @entity6 , 27 , chronicled her struggles in a blog , as she cared for a newborn doctors told her would not be long for this world			1
@entity6 struggled to keep her newborn son @entity5 healthy as he suffered from the debilitating effects of the ' butterfly ' condition despite constantly suffering damage to both his skin and organs , @entity5 survived for two years and eight months parents say the condition forces children to endure more suffering in one day than most people do in a lifetime even @entity5 's internal organs blistered , making malnutrition and loss of fluid and infection common			1
mothering him was a case of trial and error , because every wound would be different and there was no way to tell how fast they would heal , if in fact they healed at all			1
still , @entity5 survived longer than doctors expected , dying only four months shy of his third birthday in 2012			2
' these moms and these parents , they 're yearning for somebody that 's going through the same situation , ' she said			1
' it 's probably one of the cruelest , hardest things to have to go through , to watch your child suffer like that knowing you ca n't do anything about it			2
' @entity5 's mother started a blog about his care and discovered a community of parents online starved for information a new procedure that produces needed proteins through a bone marrow transplant could lead to a cure for those suffering from the condition @entity72 , 22 , has lived her entire life with a severe form of the condition that 's left her hands permanently scarred into fists except for her thumbs , which were surgically freed so that she could perform basic tasks			1
she still made it to college , and will graduate this may with a @entity83 internship on her resume along with her major in history and minor in political science			2
in her sophomore year , she started the @entity89 , an advocacy group to raise awareness and accessibility for disabled students on campus			2
though new treatments are being developed , four people who 've undergone transplants have died an estimated 25,000 to 50,000 people have epidermolysis bullosa in the @entity99 alone ' it 's literally the worst disease you 've never heard of , ' said her father , @entity103 , who runs the @entity105			1
' the simplest of things , like dental cleaning or brushing her teeth , is enough to rip the inside of her mouth open			1
yet this kid gets up and goes to school every day with a smile on her face			2
i do n't know how she does it			2
i do n't know how any of these kids do it			2
' typing an e-mail with her thumbs , as she taught herself in the third grade , @entity121 wrote : ' my heart sinks for these kids			2
so many times i fear revealing too much of my skin and bandages ... i fear this very reaction if someone sees too much			1
' @entity133 said people get ' freaked out ' by her open sores and she often thinks of herself as a leper			1
only by the time she reached college had she learned to ignore the stares and be herself regardless of surroundings			2
butterfly disease : @entity142 suffers with the painful condition dubbed ' butterfly disease ' because her skin is so weak and tears at the slightest graze painful cuts : little @entity142 suffers from painful cuts on her body if her skin is rubbed her real friends , she said , accepted her feeding tube and the full - time nurse by her side without making her self - conscious			1
scientists have hope that they can someday find a way to replace the missing protein			1
in 2007 , @entity163 fo @entity162 cancer researchers dr. @entity159 and dr. @entity160 began clinical trials to transplant stem cells in bone marrow they believed could produce the missing protein			1
they 've since done two dozen transplants , and their first patient is still alive			0
' you could actually see the skin repairing by just looking at the kid , ' @entity159 told @entity172			1
to test the results , @entity160 attempts to blister a patient 's arm with a negative vacuum device			0
a normal patient would take an hour to blister while a person suffering from the ' butterfly ' condition would see blisters in just minutes			1
after @entity183 underwent a bone marrow transplant , it took her skin more than 20 minutes to blister			1
it 's a significant improvement but not a cure			0
but the surgery remains controversial after other doctors called him a ' witch doctor ' because bone marrow had no history of affecting skin , @entity159 said			1
and four patients who underwent a cord blood transplant after a bone marrow match could not be found died after the transplant			1
@entity142 , a little girl from @entity198 , @entity199 , has also recently been diagnosed with the disease , 12 news @entity198 reports			1
she ca n't do simple tasks without putting herself at risk and to run , play and fall like other children would likely necessitate a trip to the emergency room			1
she ca n't be showered because of the pressure of falling water and wears layers of ointment and bandages around her legs - the worst affected parts of her body			0
changing her out of her diapers as a baby was a two person job - her parents told the website			1
one had to focus on holding her down and stopping her from wriggling so she did n't break her skin from the movement while the other removed the diaper gently with two hands to ensure it did n't tear her by sticking to her body			1
' there ’s nothing that i can do , as a mother , to make her pain go away , ' @entity226 told the local website			0
' you just hope that it ends quickly			1
but that kind of makes me feel like a failure as a mother , that i have this child that is in pain or gets hurt and i ca n’t protect her			0
' ' it ’s a horrible feeling as a parent			0
you feel totally out of control			0
' the incurable disease affects around 1 in 50,000 and can vary in severity with most cases at the very mild end of the scale , a much less serious illness than @entity142 's			2
blisters : 3 - year - old @entity142 has painful blisters on her body from her condition , particularly on her legs , pictured			1
they have to be constantly bandaged to protect them from every touch on the other end some children are unable to eat solid food as their throats and tongues are affected with food tearing at their bodies from the inside			1
@entity142 is able to wear normal clothes but anything sharp like a zipper is strictly banned			0
her arms can go un-bandaged but are still sensitive and she often gets blisters on her face			2
her parents use ice packs to relieve the pain but are daily forced to pop large blisters that form across her body			1
her mother , @entity276 , 40 , a nurse said the diagnosis was heartbreaking			0
' i ca n’t possibly describe how i felt at the time , ' she told the website			0
' i thought my child had a death sentence			0
it was unthinkable to me			0
' her father @entity286 , a teacher , 49 , recalls looking up the disease when she was first diagnosed			2
' boy , was that a mistake , ' he said			0
the couple have developed a close relationship with their specialist dr @entity292			0
the head of dermatology at @entity296 discovered her condition by simply rubbing his pencil eraser on the remaining skin on her leg - soon it was tearing ' we had a number of very interesting conversations with dr. @entity292 very early on , ' @entity286 said			1
' what do we do with her ? do we put her in a bubble ? keep her safe ? or do we make her a normal kid and deal with the consequences '			0
the family were able to count their small blessings that their little girl was n't suffering from one of the very extreme types of the disease			0
her eating is n't affected so she can go to school so long as she , and everyone around her , is extremely careful			0
building a normal life : things are getting easier for @entity323 as she and the people around her learn to live with her condition although she ca n't get into the rough and tumble of the playground her parents want her to have as normal a life as possible			1
' i did n’t want to mummy her , keep her like a mummy , ' @entity276 said			0
and the gift of independence is helping			0
@entity142 now changes her own dressings and when asked about her condition in school has been known to reply - ' i 'm beautiful '			2
' she ’s very much a little captain			0
she ’s a very savvy little girl , ' dr @entity292 says			0
' but we kind of always tell ( @entity10 ) parents , like , this should be their computer kid			1
she ca n’t be the soccer kid , because she just ca n’t stand any kind of friction			0
it causes blisters every time she touches anything			2
' ' having said that , @entity142 will go off and kick a soccer ball			0
' she ’s going to be a rambunctious , active girl			0
but she pays for it			0
she pays for it with blisters			2
' the couple , meanwhile , fund - raise to try and help advance research into the disease and hopefully find a cure			0
' will it be five years from now , 10 years from now , 20 years from now ? we do n’t know , ' @entity286 said			0
' we know a cure is coming			0
we feel that in our hearts			0
' brave : the @entity364 pictured are fundraising to allow research into their daughter 's condition			1
they are hopeful a cure will be found tough : @entity142 changes her own bandages despite only being three			0

brave children fight a painful condition called @entity10 which means the skin blisters at every touch or graze
only 50 children in a million are diagnosed with @entity10 at birth and only nine out of a million survive in the population
the illness dubbed ' @entity10 ' means children are unable to shower or run around too *strenuously* in case she tears her skin
parents struggle to treat the wounds that never open the same way and often refuse to heal
a new bone marrow transplant treatment offers hope but some have died undergoing the procedure
