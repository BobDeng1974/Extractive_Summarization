' but the more i read about it , the more something niggled in the back of my mind			0

the court ruled that a @entity166 safety company , @entity165 , which certified the implants , shared responsibility with the now bankrupt @entity158 supplier @entity169 , meaning more than 1,600 women , including about 100 in @entity171 , will receive the initial settlement			1
