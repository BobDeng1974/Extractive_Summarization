by @entity0 , deputy political editor and @entity2 published : 19:58 est , 29 may 2013 updated : 17:01 est , 30 may 2013 fight : work and pensions secretary @entity6 will not ' cave in ' to @entity7 , aides say @entity8 accused the @entity9 of a ‘ blatant ’ power - grab yesterday as unelected @entity7 bureaucrats took @entity12 to court over benefits for immigrants			1
the @entity15 vowed to fight ‘ every step of the way ’ to retain rules that force @entity20 migrants to pass a ‘ right to residency ’ test before they can claim a host of benefits			1
but , in an embarrassing twist for the government , the @entity25 can reveal that the pressure group which made the original legal complaint has actually been funded by the @entity30			1
around £ 500,000 of taxpayers ’ money was paid over five years to advice on @entity33 in @entity34 , which has brought test cases demanding the right for @entity20 immigrants not to have to undergo a residency test			1
ministers were accused of having ‘ lost the plot ’ for funding the very people who want them prosecuted for discrimination			0
if @entity7 bosses get their way , officials estimate , it will cost taxpayers up to £ 155million a year in extra benefits for @entity20 immigrants already in the @entity12 and may encourage thousands more to move to the @entity12 , pushing costs up higher still			1
ministers have previously claimed that a total of £ 2billion a year is paid out in benefits to foreign nationals			2
the @entity9 referred the @entity12 to the @entity20 ’s @entity53 over the right - to - reside test imposed on nationals from member states since 2004			1
ministers have previously claimed that a total of £ 2billion a year is paid out in benefits to foreign nationals			2
in a statement it said : ‘ the @entity12 discriminates unfairly against nationals from other member states			2
’ the @entity65 government is being sued by the @entity9 over the refusal of some hospitals to recognise the @entity68			2
the card allows @entity20 citizens to access free healthcare in public hospitals across the continent			0
but patients in some @entity65 hospitals have had the card refused and told to reclaim treatment costs from their travel insurance , the @entity9 claims			0
the @entity65 health ministry said the @entity68 ' has worked properly in @entity65 for years '			0
a spokesman told the @entity81 there was ' " no proof ' that some @entity12 citizens had been pressured , or even tricked , into paying via their private travel insurance			0
the @entity9 said some @entity20 migrants are missing out on payments including child benefit , child tax credit , and jobseekers allowance			1
but mr @entity8 accused the @entity9 of a ‘ blatant land - grab ’ against national governments by using the court case to seize control of welfare payments – a sphere that is the preserve of national governments			0
he said : ‘ people in this country expect me to protect the benefits system from abuse and protect the money of hardworking taxpayers			0
‘ i will not cave in and i will continue to work on strengthening our benefit system in the meantime to ensure it is not open to abuse by anyone			0
’ he added : ‘ what is going on at the moment is that the @entity9 is trying to use freedom of movement as a way in to start controlling what national governments do about those who are not in work in their countries			0
’ but ministers faced criticism after it emerged that they have been funnelling cash to the group that has persuaded the @entity9 to take the government to court			2
europe minister @entity127 has confirmed that the @entity30 gave £ 455,500 to @entity128 on @entity33 in @entity34 between 2006 and 2011			1
the decision to take @entity12 to court sparked fury yesterday			0
@entity133 mp @entity132 said : ‘ @entity134 has lost touch with reality			0
we can not and must not pay benefits to all @entity20 citizens who set foot in the @entity12			2
’ the @entity141 think tank accused the @entity9 of a ‘ gigantic own goal ’			0
research director @entity144 said : ‘ the @entity9 has thrown a hand grenade into an already intense debate about the @entity12 ’s continued @entity20 membership			1
’ @entity149 leader @entity148 said : ‘ the very fact that the @entity9 has the audacity to haul the @entity152 in front of the @entity154 for a very long and expensive trial is clear evidence that in a @entity12 versus @entity20 fight , we just do n’t win			1
’ embarrassing : it has emerged that the advice on @entity161 , which made the original legal complaint about the @entity12 's rules , was given £ 500,000 funding by the @entity30 @entity9 says @entity12 welfare regulations breaks @entity20 rules			1

@entity9 think @entity12 regulations break @entity20 rules
@entity12 requires people to be formal residents of @entity12 to claim state *handouts*
if @entity7 gets its way , will cost @entity12 *hundreds* of millions pounds a year
but legal complaint was originally brought by pressure group given £ 500,000 by the @entity30
advice on @entity33 in @entity34 provided test cases for *commission*
