@entity0 says the @entity1 , once the playground for @entity4 ’s elite to exercise the great game of power , is now more like a cheap gym the @entity1 , once the playground for @entity4 ’s elite to exercise the great game of power , is today more like a cut - price gym			1
people join hopeful and exhilarated — then find it too difficult and eventually slink off disillusioned			1
in the 18th century , @entity13 described the @entity14 as an institution that included the best and most opulent people in @entity4			1
in 1936 , the inter-war mp col. @entity17 claimed its life ‘ combines the mental gymnastics of college with the fresh wind of the outer world			1
fellow members are the staunchest friends man ever had			1
there is no other @entity27 like the @entity28			1
’ sadly , all that ’s gone			1
it ’s still a club , but a third - rate one			1
its members are our political elite , but they no longer speak the language of @entity36			1
they ’re an elite that ’s been replaced by arrivistes and middle management types			1
the great game of power has become a shouting match between public servants , teachers and social workers on the one side ( @entity47 ) and small businessmen and funny money men from the @entity50 on the other ( @entity51 ) , all orchestrated and scripted by apparatchiks from lesser league student politics			1
dismal @entity55 from @entity56 would be more at home in the @entity14 than @entity58 or @entity59			1
i ’m standing down at the election after 38 years			1
because of age mainly — i was 80 in september			2
i was elected in the year @entity63 won @entity64 , @entity65 won the @entity66 and @entity67 was prime minister			2
comparing those days with now , i can only say the level of debate has sunk dismally — and it was already on the downward slope when i arrived			1
@entity55 from @entity56 , played by @entity73 middle , would be more at home in the @entity14 than @entity58 or @entity59 we no longer discuss the issues of @entity76 , of course , because we do n’t have one			2
but the lightning flash of spontaneous free debate that was once taken for granted in the @entity14 is no longer			1
@entity36 used to give three - hour speeches , but today we have time - limited debates in which speakers gabble for five minutes before it ’s the next person ’s turn			1
political minds no longer wrestle with the great issues of the day , or with each other			2
instead , mps read student essays , often written for them in lamentable grammar , in the hope of getting into their constituencies ’s local papers — never the nationals			1
we should introduce the @entity4 equivalent of the @entity96 in which representatives write down their speeches , so they do n’t have to say them out loud and bore others waiting to recite their own productions			1
the most striking decline in standards has been in prime minister ’s questions , which has become a half - hour of custard - pie throwing the most striking decline in standards has been in prime minister ’s questions , which has become a half - hour of custard - pie throwing			2
questions are handed out for mps to ask : ‘ have you stopped beating the poor ? ’ from the @entity114 , versus : ‘ is n’t it marvellous news from my constituency where 20 shelf - stacking jobs have been created by @entity119 ? ’ on the @entity120			2
then the questions receive rehearsed answers , alternating between the prime minister replying : ‘ @entity124 ’s a twerp			2
’ and : ‘ our long - term economic plan is working miracles			2
’ the first - class brains and the serious thinkers — people such as @entity47 ’s @entity131 education secretary @entity132 , above , the @entity133 and @entity134 @entity51 intellectual @entity135 or the outspoken and cerebral @entity59 — who once stimulated and excited the @entity14 , now go into the @entity50 , the law , accountancy houses or our huge tax - avoidance industry questions to ministers about their departments function at a similar level , as spoon - fed debating points are raised by sycophantic mps			1
as for the debates on legislation or proper issues , which used to be where ministers had to defend their arguments , it ’s now rare to hear a speech that makes one think because it ’s all agreement and soundbites			2
most speeches toe the party line , usually peppered with cliches such as ‘ hard - working families ’ or ‘ cost of living crisis ’			1
the first - class brains and the serious thinkers — people such as @entity47 ’s @entity131 education secretary @entity132 , the @entity133 and @entity134 @entity51 intellectual @entity135 or the outspoken and cerebral @entity59 — who once stimulated and excited the @entity14 , now go into the @entity50 , the law , accountancy houses or our huge tax - avoidance industry			2
as an academic snob , my feeling is that is we have fewer firsts today but more bottom seconds from lesser universities			2
so we lose out in every way			2
public relations has replaced policy and we ’ve ended up with fewer serious thinkers but more political obsessives , all of them with less experience of the real world of work			2
we ’ve also lost the role of providing the national forum of debate to the media , who ’ve stolen our job of holding the executive account			1
@entity186 the old relationship — whereby parliamentary debates created the news and the media reported it — has been reversed			0
we now take the issues from the media and chase the hares they set running rather than vice versa			0
it ’s true that , as @entity146 , we each have a platform from which to ask questions in the @entity14 , but this is far less important than it used to be because we @entity146 have lost respect			1
ministerial departments no longer jump to our demands			0
privatised utilities and the quasi-departmental firms that leech off government spending — like security firm @entity207 and the business out - sourcing companies @entity210 and @entity211 — fob us off with @entity214 answers			0
so we ’re dependant on getting the interest and support of the media to make the government listen			0
then there is the changed working environment			0
the @entity14 has always been a club			0
now it ’s a dull one , where socialising , friendships , mixing and bonding have fallen victim to family - friendly hours			0
these have turned the grind of late nights and long debates into a two - and - a - half - day week			0
members arrive late on monday , get as many meetings in as they can , go home thursday and spend spare evenings watching telly rather than plotting or chatting in the @entity14 bars			0
the lush facilities of @entity236 , where mps have their offices , are crowded out during the day with ten o’clock to six o’clock staffers in sharp suits — who know everything from electoral calculus to social security rules better than we do — but are deserted at night			0
we ’ve lost the awkward squad of mps who tripped up the executive by throwing spanners into its works — people such as @entity47 ’s @entity252 or @entity51 @entity253			0
it ’s true that , as @entity146 , we each have a platform from which to ask questions in the @entity14 , but this is far less important than it used to be because we @entity146 have lost respect - ministerial departments no longer jump to our demands ca n’t have the legislative factory disrupted , you see			1
none of this , i should add to avoid a deluge of feminist twitterati , is due to the increase in the number of women			0
they ’ve civilised the place , eliminated the boys ’ club sillinesses and brought more realism to debates			0
it ’s due to the tighter grip of the parties on their mps and the increase in the number of apparatchiks			0
from being a training ground for senators , the @entity14 has become a numbers game dominated by two chanting choruses — one praising , the other criticising the executive steam - roller as it drives over us			0
we can still abuse the executive and throw our pre-cooked custard pies , but when the executive makes its biggest mistakes — @entity296 , @entity295 , @entity297 , @entity298 and 3 — or erodes our liberties for whatever purpose , we can be relied on to rally round			0
paradoxically , the amount of work and number of staff have increased as our influence has declined			0
we now have more mps ’ committees than ever before — including , joy of my life , the @entity312 on which i sit			0
trivial these give mps a new role and new satisfaction as amateur @entity318 , but activity is n’t influence			0
it keeps us busy , but much of what ’s raised is trivial			0
select committees have done some good reports , particularly @entity324 ’s @entity312 , but it ’s mostly closing doors after horses have bolted and government is much better at apologising and promising than it is at listening and changing			0
perhaps i complain too much			0
my long career has been a fighting retreat from @entity333 , @entity335 economic management , the mixed economy and equality before the triumph of neo-liberalism , the @entity330 and free - market economics			0
i ’ve enjoyed it and i ’d still like to carry on if i was n’t so old and decrepit in what ’s becoming a youth club			0
yet the fact is @entity146 today are no longer tribunes of the people , they ’re the sewer workers and street cleaners of @entity4 ’s creaking constitution .			1
