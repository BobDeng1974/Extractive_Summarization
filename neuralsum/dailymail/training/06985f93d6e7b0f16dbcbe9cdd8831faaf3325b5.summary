" ' the astronaut interrupts , shouting : ' i know , i know - feed the monkeys and do n't touch anything !

’ the coach is said to be furious , and insists the joke refers only to a fictional event and can not be interpreted as having any racial connotations , despite the historic use of ' monkey ' as a racist term for black people			1
a video still of @entity24 emerging from the tunnel for the second half against @entity14 , following @entity2 's gaffe at half time unfazed : @entity24 has taken to @entity102 today to questioned what all the fuss was about and say that no offence was taken game : @entity24 leaves the pitch after being substituted , walking past @entity2 on the way @entity21 decides to send a shuttle into space with two monkeys and an astronaut on board			1
