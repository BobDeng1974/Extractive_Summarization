today is the busiest day for buying @entity1 trees , with between six and eight million sold every year between six and eight million @entity1 trees are sold in @entity3 every year — and today is the busiest day for buying them			1
but how many of us know which type of fir will best suit our needs or even that there are distinct types ? here @entity11 , the national christmas tree expert at @entity13 , explains how to choose , cherish and care for your perfect tree ... 1			1
@entity17 there are four main types sold in the @entity3 and each has different merits			1
the @entity22 fir has a glossy green colour and big needles which are lovely and soft , making it suitable for those with young children			1
it ’s more expensive than the @entity30 spruce , which has that classic rich , fresh @entity1 fragrance and a very structured pyramid shape			1
these are inexpensive but their needles are sharper and tend to fall off , and its sap is very sticky — it wo n’t mess up your house , but you ’ll get it on your hands while lugging it home , so watch your clothing			2
the two less popular options are the @entity47 fir and the @entity49 fir			1
the @entity47 has a blue - green colour and is a narrower tree , so ideal if you have less space			1
it has dense foliage , so not ideal for bauble lovers , but lovely if you just want tinsel and lights			2
the @entity49 fir is thick stemmed , which can make it a struggle if you ’re using a tree stand , but it has better spaced foliage			1
you get what you pay for with a christmas tree , price does tend to indicate quality			2
the more expensive ones are more likely to have been hand - trimmed before being cut down or dug up , so are in a good shape			1
judge by looking carefully before you buy — trees are like cats and dogs , you can tell if they ’re healthy by the sheen of their coat			1
ideally , the tree should be a shiny , glossy green			2
i recommend taking the tree by the trunk and tapping it on the ground			2
evergreens lose needles all year round , but if too many fall off you might want to reconsider			1
beware the tag although tree size goes up in feet , sellers are allowed 15 cm ( 6 in ) either side — so a 6 ft tree ( the most popular height ) could be a little taller or shorter			0
this means it ’s vital to know both the exact height of the room you ’re putting it in — especially if you want one which grazes the ceiling — and to measure the tree , too			0
remember the tree stand will add up to 15 cm. @entity103 is not lost if you get the height wrong , though			0
just trim the trunk and take off some lower branches			0
watch the wrapping a ready - wrapped tree might seem helpful — but do n’t buy these			1
it ’s vital to look at the tree ’s shape out of the netting , in case it ’s wider than you want or an uneven shape			0
without seeing it unwrapped , you do n’t know what you ’re getting			0
any respectable seller will unwrap and rewrap the tree for no extra charge			0
wear gardening gloves to handle it and be careful of the tip , which can be damaged easily			0
make sure any tree is wrapped before you take it home			0
treat it like @entity135 once home , cut 2 cm or 3 cm from the stump straight across using a handsaw			0
it ’s easier than you think , and helps the tree take up moisture , like trimming cut flowers			0
then place it in a tree stand that holds water and generously water the tree every day			1
it can drink two litres daily , depending on room temperature			0
unlike cut flowers , do n’t add sugar			0
if you want a live tree to plant afterwards , choose a pot - grown version as these have a better chance of living , since the roots are whole			1
all @entity1 trees are grown from seeds not cuttings			1
vitally , whichever type you buy , do not unwrap the tree until it ’s secure , otherwise you ’ll be fighting branches and foliage			0
then leave it to stand for 24 hours before decorating so the branches settle down			0
if you want a live tree to plant afterwards , choose a pot - grown version as these have a better chance of living 6			1
@entity174 putting a tree close to a stove or radiator will dry it out			0
a @entity22 fir will lose its sheen and a @entity30 spruce will lose its needles			1
obviously , keep well away from candles , as it can easily catch fire			0
@entity185 many councils will collect trees for you or you can take it to a recycling centre			2
alternatively , chop it up and use as a rich scented mulch for the garden			0
they do n’t make good firewood ; their sap will take a year to dry out properly			2
if you have bought a pot - grown tree , plant it at the back of the garden , as they grow extremely high .			2
