a physicist 's marriage proposal has gone viral after he asked his girlfriend to marry him by presenting her with a scientific paper on their relationship			1
the proposal from @entity8 physicist @entity7 comes in the form of a heart - warming mock academic study entitled ' @entity12 : a longitudinal study '			1
the scientist explains the stages of the couple 's relationship from their initial meeting at the @entity20 seven years ago to the section titled ' conclusions ' offering @entity23 a @entity25 box to tick			1
a couple with chemistry : @entity7 's proposal to fellow physicist @entity23 went viral when she posted it online on sunday physical attraction : the happy couple , pictured , will be married in may this year following @entity7 's unusual proposal ' the summary of the findings of the study are presented in @entity37 and that that the project happiness is upward with high confidence , ' it says			1
' taking these results into account , the author proposes to @entity23 the indefinite continuation of the study			2
the subjects response to their proposal should be indicated below			0
' the paper features a ' happiness graph ' and is littered with somewhat unromantic scientific terms such as ' optimal conditions ' and ' high level of compatibility '			1
but luckily for @entity7 his girlfriend , also a scientist , saw the funny side and loved his geeky proposal so decided to tick the ' yes ' box			1
@entity7 proposed back in march 2012 but the couple are due to marry in may this year			2
speaking to the @entity20 website yesterday @entity7 said : ' i wanted to do it in a unique way that would be special to us			0
' i had asked her to read over ' a paper i had been having trouble understanding ' a few days earlier , and after i lured her to the spot we were standing when we met , i got down on one knee to get the paper out of my bag and hand it to her , then i just stood up and waited			0
' successful experiment : physicists @entity7 and @entity23 , pictured , will get married in may this year after @entity7 proposed with a scientific paper positive reaction : @entity7 , left , proposed to @entity23 , right , with an academic paper			1
she said ' yes ' despite his unorthodox approach campus romance : @entity7 and @entity23 met while both studying physics at the @entity20 , pictured ' she did n't notice what was happening at all , but , as a typical physics grad , she read the abstract then skipped straight to the conclusion and quickly realized ! ' @entity23 posted the proposal to @entity87 on sunday and it has since spread like wildfire across the internet being read by thousands			1
the paper talks through the couple 's relationship from their initial meeting			1
as it explains : ' this meeting would have been a fleeting interaction as so many two body interactions are , but a high level of compatibility coupled with a high rate of interaction due to similar timetables resulted in a local resonance and eventually a semi-bound state			2
' ' over the course of this phase of the study , the locational dependence of the results was tested across two main long term locations as well as a multitude of short term locations local , interstate , and international			0
' ' additional tests included a two week separation and a surprise ( @entity117 ) , ' it adds			0
if at times the scientific proposal is hard to follow for the lay reader it made perfect sense to the two academics			0
the pair met in @entity20 where they both studied physics , @entity126 in @entity127 and @entity23 in @entity128 and @entity129			2
@entity7 is currently a phd student working on ' galactic evolution ' with a special interest in ' @entity132 ' while @entity23 works with the @entity133 - a schools science program for children across @entity8 thousands have read the proposal online and more than one thousand joined in the fun , assessing the paper for its scientific merits			1
others urged writers of @entity143 to adopt the proposal technique for its central character @entity146			0
' no control group , inadequate sample size , and unwarranted assumptions about future conditions ... but yeah , congratulations , ' one @entity87 user wrote			0
' while innovative and emotionally appealing , the submitted paper fails to cite any of its sources and skims over its methodology , " another added			0
' as such , i can not in good conscience recommend it for publication			0
' ' has it been peer - reviewed ? if not , the results could be bogus			0
but seriously : congratulations : ) , ' said another , while one fellow scientist added her appreciation : ' as a scientist and a lady , this is the cutest thing i 've ever seen			2

@entity7 presented his girlfriend , @entity23 , with the paper ' two body interactions : a longitudinal study '
it follows the progress of the couple 's relationship , including a happiness graph and sections entitled abstract , *overview* of results and conclusion before asking the all - *important* question
luckily for the physics phd student , fellow scientist @entity23 said yes and the couple plan to marry in may
