president @entity0 blasted the @entity1 on tuesday , after a damning inspector general report on the agency 's practice of singling out conservative groups seeking tax exempt status			1
' the report ’s findings are intolerable and inexcusable , ' mr @entity0 said on tuesday in a statement , as the @entity11 opens an investigation into the @entity1 practices			1
the @entity15 reaction came after the release of an audit by the @entity18 , that found the tax agency did indeed single out groups based on policy positions			1
but critics fault the report for failing to identify who at the @entity1 was responsible for instituting the discriminatory policy and some have suggested the audit is nothing more than the @entity0 administration 's ' whitewashing ' of the scandalous episode			1
' this report shows that some of its employees failed that test , ' the statement continued			0
the president said he has charged treasury secretary @entity49 ' to hold those responsible for these failures accountable , and to make sure that each of the inspector general ’s recommendations are implemented quickly , so that such conduct never happens again			1
' attorney general @entity56 announced on tuesday , four hours before the release of the report , that he has called for a criminal investigation into the @entity1 's practices			2
the @entity62 probe will focus on whether the @entity1 conducted any illegal activity throughout the course of the targeting scandal			0
he called the @entity1 ' actions ' outrageous and unacceptable			0
' ' the @entity11 is coordinating with the @entity62 to see if any laws were broken in connection with those matters , ' the attorney general told the press			0
@entity56 's remarks came a day after it was revealed that acting irs commissioner @entity74 repeatedly failed to tell @entity75 that @entity77 groups were being inappropriately targeted , even after he had been briefed on the matter			2
the @entity1 said on monday that @entity74 was first informed on may , 3 , 2012 , that applications for tax - exempt status by @entity77 groups were inappropriately singled out for extra , sometimes burdensome scrutiny			1
likely story : acting @entity1 commissioner @entity74 , right , admitted the agency made missteps but insisted they were not politically motivated the report by the @entity18 , that was delivered to @entity75 , accused the agency of ' insufficient oversight ' in its practice of paying close attention to social welfare organizations applying for tax - exempt status as @entity92 ( 4 ) s , for those groups that had conservative key words in their title			1
501 ( c ) ( 4 ) s are a type of nonprofit in the @entity38 tax code , described as ' social welfare ' groups , that tend to be civic organizations and political action committees			2
' the inappropriate and changing criteria may have led to inconsistent treatment of organizations applying for tax - exempt status ... [ ineffective management ] allowed inappropriate criteria to be developed and stay in place for more than 18 months , ' the report said			1
the organizations were targeted for review ' based upon their names or policy positions ' and not due to ' indications of potential political campaign interventions , ' the report continued			1
the practice is believed to have occurred from 2010 to 2012			0
the report proposed that the @entity1 provide better documentation for the reasoning behind selecting certain groups for extra review and that it resolve cases which had been in limbo for as long as 3 years , in some cases			2
probe : attorney general @entity56 has demanded a full investigation into the @entity1 's scrutiny of conservative groups applying for tax exempt status critics have faulted the report for failing to identify which agency employees were responsible for the flagrant discrimination , with the audit stating simply , ' we could not specifically determine who had been involved in creating the criteria			1
' @entity140 @entity139 sen. @entity139 , the ranking member on the @entity141 , said on tuesday , ' it was n’t just some lowly staffer ... very senior management at the @entity1 here in @entity146 knew what was going on for over a year and did n’t say a word			0
' ' there ’s a reason @entity75 is a coequal branch of government - something i wonder if the @entity153 fully appreciates - and we are going to fully examine what they are doing to ensure the people of our nation have confidence that we are looking out for the public interest			0
' sen. @entity139 has called on @entity74 to resign			0
senator @entity161 , a @entity139 from @entity162 , said earlier on tuesday that @entity163 would exhaust every effort to find who was responsible for the matter			0
' we do know this : we ca n’t count on the administration to be forthcoming about the details of this scandal , because so far they ’ve been anything but , ' he told reporters			0
@entity176 rep. @entity175 , the @entity163 chairman of the @entity177 said , ' i am astounded and appalled that the @entity1 targeted organizations based on their political beliefs ... the @entity1 ’s repeated failure to be truthful is completely unethical and an embarrassment to this government			1
' the @entity187 ranking member , rep. @entity186 , agreed , ' chairman @entity184 and i have agreed it is essential that there be a thorough and bipartisan investigation and effective remedial action			0
' groups with the words ' patriot , ' ' tea party ' and ' 9/12 ' were said to have been flagged and ' inappropriate criteria ' was used by the agency in reviewing their applications			1
' 9/12 ' refers to a movement launched by ultra-conservative media pundit @entity201 , who started the effort on his former @entity203			0
the @entity204 was launched in 2009 to encourage @entity38 to return to the patriotism the country felt on september 12 , 2001 - the day after the terrorist attacks when citizens put aside partisan disagreements in the name of solidarity			0
the @entity1 insisted on tuesday that the tax agency 's scrutiny of groups with conservative buzzwords like ' patriot ' and ' tea party ' was not politically motivated though the attempted appeasement has failed to satisfy concerned @entity163			1
@entity219 , acting commissioner for the agency 's tax exempt division , defended employees who targeted the groups applying for tax exempt status , insisting it was out of a ' desire for efficiency and not out of any political or partisan viewpoint			1
' @entity219 's defense came as part of a damning inspector general audit that alleged the agency did indeed single out groups based on policy positions			1
hot seat : @entity15 press secretary @entity236 fielded questions on tuesday about @entity0 's knowledge of the @entity1 scandal , insisting the @entity15 was not privy to the agency 's practices acting @entity1 commissioner @entity74 admitted on tuesday , ' mistakes were made ... we should have done a better job of handling the influx of applications by advocacy organizations , ' in an editorial piece published in @entity251			1
mr @entity74 similarly defended his agency though , echoing the @entity1 talking point that the scrutiny was not rooted in political ideology			2
' they were in no way due to any political or partisan motivation			2
we are - and will continue to be - dedicated to reviewing all applications for tax - exempt status in an impartial manner , ' he wrote			1
despite assurances from the agency that the attention was a mere oversight and did not have political roots , @entity0 is feeling intense pressure from both sides of the aisle over the embarrassment			2
the @entity141 announced this week that it will join the @entity272 in investigating the matter			0
the @entity15 committee is preparing for its initial hearing and in a letter dated on may 14 , the @entity163 committee chair and the @entity187 ranking member requested an extensive list of documents from the @entity1 to be submitted by may 21			0
' despite repeated calls for cooperation , the agency failed to be completely truthful in its responses to the @entity141 during its nearly two - year long investigation of this matter , ' the @entity281 stated			0
probe : the @entity272 has requested an extensive list of documents from the @entity1 in advance of the congressional hearing the @entity1 apologized on friday for what it acknowledged was ' inappropriate ' targeting of conservative political groups during the 2012 election to see whether they were violating their tax - exempt status			1
in some cases , the @entity1 acknowledged , agents inappropriately asked for lists of donors			0
during the @entity15 press briefing on tuesday , @entity0 's press secretary @entity236 fielded a barrage of questions about the scandal			0
president @entity0 ' has no tolerance for targeting of specific groups , conservative groups , if the reporting is true on this , and he would expect action to be taken , ' mr @entity236 insisted			1
the @entity15 spokesman asserted that the @entity15 had not been aware of the tax agency 's methods			2
on monday , president @entity0 said he first learned about the issue from news reports on friday			0
referring to the alleged practice as ' outrageous , ' mr @entity0 said during a press conference at the @entity15 , ' there is no place for it , and they have to be held fully accountable			2
' ' the @entity1 as an independent agency requires absolute integrity and people have to have confidence that they are applying the laws in a non-partisan way , ' he said .			0
