by @entity1 reporter published : 06:50 est , 6 december 2013 updated : 09:04 est , 6 december 2013 like millions of tech fans around the world president @entity2 would reportedly love to get his hands on a shiny new @entity6 for @entity7 , but sadly for him his security advisers wo n't allow it			1
@entity2 is instead being forced to carrying on using his trusty , yet now rather out - of - date , @entity12 device which is strictly limited to just 10 email contacts			1
speaking to a group of young people at the @entity16 during a pitch for his healthcare reforms @entity2 quipped : ' i am not allowed , for security reasons , to have an @entity6 '			1
tech savvy : president @entity2 taps out a message on his @entity12 last month			1
he will be using the trusty device for some time to come after being told he can not have an iphone for security reasons the president said that both his daughters @entity28 and @entity30 had iphones and that they ' seem to spend a lot of time using them '			1
@entity2 famously managed to keep hold of his @entity12 after his inauguration in 2009 , despite saying his security advisors would ' pry it from his hands '			1
but the earlier - generation smartphone has been locked down with only 10 people reportedly having access to his personal email account			2
neither @entity44 nor @entity45 used email during their presidencies			2
@entity50 fan : president @entity2 checks his @entity51 during the @entity52 in november last year			1
he was reportedly gifted one of the tablets by @entity50 founder @entity55 @entity2 is a known fan of the @entity51 having been gifted one of the tablet devices but none other than @entity55 himself			1
although the exact reasons for denying the president an @entity6 have not been released , it is feared such a high - tech device would pose a threat to both his personal and national security			0
even if he were not using the device to tap out any politically sensitive messages , if successfully hacked , it could act as a beacon and give away his real - time physical location			2
@entity72 's @entity71 newspaper claims to have seen documents that revealed @entity75 agents loved the iphone because of sketchy scripts that allowed them to spy on 38 different features within the operating system			0
owing to a stronger encryption processes @entity81 have enjoyed a better reputation for security than both @entity50 and @entity84			0
in addition to this the president 's @entity12 is limited to only 10 email contacts and is rumoured to have been heavily modified			1
one theory however is that the @entity75 are particularly well aware of the problems with the @entity91 's security because they have exploited them as part of their clandestine prism surveillance program			0
@entity50 was one of several tech companies that may have allowed the @entity75 ( @entity75 ) direct access to servers containing customer data , according to revelations by former @entity75 contractor @entity102			0
the companies deny the allegation			0
@entity12 , a @entity107 company formerly known as @entity108 , virtually invented the idea of on - the - go email , but lost its market stranglehold as rivals brought out more consumer - friendly devices , like @entity50 's @entity6 and phones using @entity116 's @entity84 software			1
the company recently halted plans to be sold and is trying to chart a new course by focusing on large business and government clients			0
a spokesman for @entity124 security software said : ' in the uneasy times of rapidly growing cyber-espionage attacks , there is no wonder why governments and high - profile institutions tend to be very careful and adopt strict security procedures			0
' at this point , it appears a necessity to do a thorough security check of every single device that will be used to hold or transmit sensitive data , before handing it over to the high - profile government official , such as the president			2
' there are two main vectors of risk ; one is the software insecurities and vulnerabilities , that could be used by attackers to gain access to the device ( e.g. in order to steal data , install spyware application , etc. ) ; the second is the possibility of hardware backdoors or suspicious firmware changes , that could have been made to the device at the factory level			0
' auditing and approval of new devices must take into account all these concerns			0
this is especially true for high - profile organizations			0
nevertheless , the @entity16 's movement does n't necessarily mean that there is a serious security issue with @entity6 in general			2
