leaning over police crime scene tape , i ’m peering into what was once a kennel			0
there is no roof , and the floor is covered with blackened material			0
the acrid smell is horrendous			0
among the rubble are dog collars , a tennis ball and several chew toys			0
when the @entity14 was set on fire on september 11 , killing 60 dogs in the adoption unit , my feeling was that there really is no hope for mankind			1
on my visit to what is left of the home i meet @entity24 , a staffie who was one of only two dogs pulled alive from the burned - down wing			1
she had come to the home five months before as a stray			0
she was in the adoption unit as she was deemed ready to be rehomed			1
once pulled from the fire , @entity24 was rushed to the home ’s sister site in @entity42 and placed in intensive care			1
she remains on medication for the effects of smoke inhalation and has nightmares			0
@entity48 , manager of the site , says : ‘ i hear her crying and groaning in her sleep , and she paddles with her paws			0
she has been very depressed			0
’ the other survivor , two - year - old @entity52 , has already been rehomed			1
a lovely dark lurcher with white paws , he was adopted by a local family , the @entity56 , who got a bit carried away and took two other dogs home too			1
@entity52 ’s only legacy from the fire is a cough and an abscess , and a propensity to sleep a lot			1
fourteen - year - old @entity65 took @entity52 to school to help raise awareness for the home , and to show classmates how a rescue dog can be more rewarding than purchasing a pedigree			1
donations from the public have now reached £ 1.4 million , which means the damaged wing can be demolished this week , and a bigger , better kennel built to rescue many more dogs			1
but much more needs to be done in an area where hundreds of dogs wander the streets , and the local rescue centres are full to brimming			2
stepping into the fray are a task force of eight women who , in their own words ‘ like to make things happen ’			0
destroyed : the adoption unit after the fire at the home			1
donations from the public towards the home have now topped £ 1.4million they are @entity93 , 32 , a historian ; @entity94 , 46 , a barrister and wife of former @entity97 footballer @entity96 ; @entity98 , 32 , a manager at @entity99 ; businesswoman @entity100 , 41 ; @entity101 , 50 , a company director ; @entity102 , 58 a charity executive ; @entity104 , 35 , a social media agency owner ; and @entity106 , a 27 - year - old @entity107 professional			1
@entity93 tells me : ‘ i rescued a @entity111 pointer from the home eight years ago , and sadly he died recently			0
i went back to the home to sponsor a kennel five days before the fire			2
i ’d never met the other women before , but we got together in the days after the fire			2
’ we are at historic @entity120 in @entity42 , where the task force is orchestrating a calendar shoot with rescue dogs past and present			1
the star of the show , as miss january , is undoubtedly @entity24 , but owners who have had many years of love and companionship from former @entity14 ’ home inmates have been keen to step up to the mark and allow their dogs to take part			1
they include comedian @entity134 , who has a rescued @entity97 bull terrier , @entity136 , @entity134 says : ‘ @entity136 came to us in october 2007 and is the third dog we have had from the dogs ’ home			2
i would never go to a breeder , there are so many lovely dogs looking for homes			2
’ it ’s hoped the calendar , which we preview here , will raise thousands more to help with the rebuild			2
calendar photographer @entity149 is donating his time			1
he says : ‘ i grew up in a council house round the back of the dogs ’ home , and always went to sleep to the sound of barking			2
‘ the local area , @entity158 , gets a negative press , but the fact locals turned up , spontaneously , to help when the fire broke out says it all			2
’ meeting the task force women and kennel workers has gone a long way towards restoring my faith in human nature , especially when the home ’s manager @entity169 tells me : ‘ people are still bringing along dog beds they whipped from under their own pets			0
some still feel warm ! ’ the calendar is available from november 17 at dogshome.net , £ 7.99			1
the cutest pin - ups ever ? the calendar of hope that rose out of the smoke this is @entity181 , the calendar cover star			0
he was rescued from a block near the adoption wing and adopted the weekend after the fire			1
here we showcase his calendar co-stars … @entity24 : rescued from the blazing block			1
recovering but needs a home @entity190 : two - year - old adopted as a puppy by local family			0
has a sock fetish @entity195 : adopted seven years ago , now a sniffer dog for the prison service @entity198 : was rehomed three times , before settling with current companion bruno : adopted in july			0
puts himself to bed every night at 9pm @entity203 : ten - year - old rehomed in 2010			0
missing one leg , and snores @entity207 : @entity208 tied to a gate two days after the fire			0
now rehomed @entity211 : bone idle three - year - old adopted by task force member @entity213 @entity214 : rescued by comedian @entity134 and his family seven years ago @entity216 : adopted in 2009 , loves agility work and performed at @entity218 this year poppy : rehomed in november 2008			0
