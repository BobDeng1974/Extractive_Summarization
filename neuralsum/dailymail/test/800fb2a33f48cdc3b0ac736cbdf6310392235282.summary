@entity0 has warned @entity1 that leaving @entity2 could see him end up on the scrapheap at a big club , similar to the way that @entity6 and @entity7 did at @entity8			1
@entity1 stunned @entity2 earlier this week , giving an interview confirming that he has turned down a new £ 100,000 - a - week contract and admitting he is ' quite flattered ' by interest from @entity12			1
@entity13 and @entity8 are also keen on @entity16 football 's hottest property			1
but @entity0 , who used to play for @entity8 with @entity6 and @entity7 , has warned his @entity18 team - mate a move to one of @entity23 football 's heavyweights may not be everything he has dreamed of			1
@entity1 has been warned about the dangers of leaving @entity2 by his team - mate @entity0 @entity0 compared @entity1 's situation with that of @entity6 ( left ) and @entity7 joining @entity8 @entity0 ( centre ) says @entity2 is the best place for @entity1 to stay and continue his development as a player after starring in @entity34 's midfield and making his @entity16 debut , @entity6 was being linked with every big club around			1
sir @entity37 was known to be an admirer but @entity6 was snapped up by @entity8 for £ 12million			1
repeated injury problems and the presence of @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity44 saw his appearances limited , while @entity46 arrived for £ 30m the next summer			0
after just seven league starts in two years , @entity6 moved on to relegation - threatened @entity48 for £ 10m			1
it was a similar story for @entity7			2
after powering @entity52 's promotion to the @entity53 and scoring eight times in the top flight , @entity13 youth product @entity7 moved to @entity8 for £ 8m			1
but he too struggled with the competition in @entity8 's squad and moved to @entity58 on loan last season			2
he found it hard to break into the team there and returned to @entity8 before heading out on loan again to @entity63 in january where he has found some form			2
@entity6 joined @entity8 in a £ 12million deal in 2012 , while @entity7 made the same move from @entity52 for an £ 8m fee later that summer			1

@entity6 joined relegation - threatened @entity48 last summer to end his @entity8 nightmare while @entity7 is trying to rebuild his career at @entity63			1
@entity0 says @entity1 could be making a similar mistake by leaving @entity18			2
' both @entity6 and @entity7 went to a club where there is big competition and did n't play , ' @entity0 said			1
' if @entity1 left @entity2 he would n't be sure to start games			2
make a mistake or do n't score for two games and he will be on the bench			0
there is no messing at clubs like that			0
' @entity87 used his pre-match press conference ahead of saturday 's trip to @entity12 to reiterate that @entity1 was not for sale , and @entity0 sees @entity2 as the perfect place for the 20 - year - old to continue his development			1
' i 'm not surprised there 's speculation because everybody would want to have a player like him , ' he told the @entity2 @entity99			2
' but he needs to stay here			0
@entity2 is a great place for him			0
@entity1 stunned @entity2 this week , giving an interview confirming that he had turned down a new deal the likes of @entity13 , @entity8 and @entity12 would have big competition in their squads for a place ' this is definitely the best place for him to continue his development			1
at @entity2 , he 's beginning to be one of the most important players			2
he 's playing every week			0
' if he went to another club there would be big challenges he would face			0
he would n't be the most important player			0
' @entity115 revealed on thursday that @entity13 had joined the race to sign @entity16 star @entity1 , with the @entity53 leaders wanting to be kept informed of any developments in his contract situation			1
@entity120 and @entity121 are also monitoring the developments in his stand - off at @entity18			0
@entity6 made just seven @entity53 starts for @entity8 during his two - year spell before leaving the club the former @entity34 man now plays for relegation - threatened @entity48 after a tough time at @entity8 @entity7 's spell was even more difficult , he made just two league starts for @entity8 before moving out on loan @entity7 is on loan at @entity63 as he looks to rebuild his reputation as a young @entity16 talent doubts over @entity12 ’s ability to fund a move have seen their interest questioned , but they are confident they have the financial firepower to compete for him with the likes of @entity13 and @entity8			1
@entity2 boss @entity87 said on thursday : ‘ he ’s got two - and - a - half years to go on his deal and he ’s not going anywhere in the summer			2
' i can not speak for the owners but i have a good idea of what they would do			0
i know them well enough and for me it would not happen			0
@entity2 are one of the superpowers of football and the owners have made it clear that money does n’t come into it			0
if the club does n’t want to sell , it wo n’t sell , it ’s as simple as that			0
money has never been the objective for the club			0
‘ whatever player - raheem or anybody - it would always be on the terms of the club			0
‘ he still has two - and - a - bit years left of his deal so it ’s not something we ’re overly concerned about			0
i ’m confident that at the end of the season we ’ll find the solution			0
’ @entity87 has said @entity1 is going nowhere this summer despite the speculation over his future @entity7 spent more time on the bench than the pitch at @entity8 , and @entity0 thinks it could be similar for @entity1			1
