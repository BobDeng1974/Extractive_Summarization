the scary thing is that @entity1 still has years to go			1
at just 27 years old , he became the all - time top scorer in @entity4 football history , scoring a brilliant hat - trick to cement his place in the record books above @entity8			1
@entity1 began the game on 250 goals , one behind the former @entity12 striker			1
he ended it on 253 , putting paid to the last few weeks of wondering just how and when he would eventually become , inarguably , the greatest goalscorer @entity16 has ever known			2
of course , @entity1 is so much more than a goalscorer			2
@entity18 found that out the hard way on saturday night , with the @entity21 the heartbeat of a @entity24 side which did n’t trip up in a potentially tricky clash against @entity27 ’s high - flying @entity26 , moving back to second place , two points behind @entity30			1

attendance : 78,283 the @entity86 chanted his name , his team - mates threw him up into the air , giving him the bumps			0
@entity1 walked towards the tunnel , clutching the match ball			2
before he was allowed to leave , the @entity24 team stood by his side , watching a video of his goals and clips of his former team - mates and coaches hailing him			1
@entity1 looked taken aback , almost sheepish as some of his greatest moments were played out to the 78,000 spectators			0
but he also looked happy			0
despite his comments earlier this week , suggesting his future may lie elsewhere , it ’s almost impossible to see him leaving his home here			0
the other @entity24 players gave him a guard of honour as he left the field			0
by contrast , @entity53 is still searching for his first @entity24 goal and was denied by @entity18 goalkeeper @entity62 when he raced on to a clipped through ball			1
the striker switched positions with @entity1 after 15 minutes , taking the centre - forward role while the @entity21 moved to the right			1
@entity1 's position is never easy to describe , as he drifts inside when he fancies , and on one such excursion he was knocked to the ground by @entity68 on the edge of the box			2
it was a cheap free - kick to give away and @entity1 made @entity18 pay a hefty price			1
he arrowed the ball into the top left corner , leaving @entity62 clutching at thin air			0
the scoreboard lit up with a message to congratulate @entity1 on reaching @entity8 's all - time record and the relief on the @entity24 legend 's face was clear for the world to see			1
relief for having matched the record , relief even for having scored for the first time in @entity16 for over a month			1
neither obstacle was likely to last long in the face of this footballing giant			0
the last few weeks have not been a happy time for @entity24			2
a couple of defeats , combined with a poor performance away at @entity148 have led to a lot of questions being asked about the coach ’s tactics and methods			0
there were questions being asked just a minute into the second half			0
@entity73 got down the left and fired the ball across			0
@entity24 ’s on loan midfielder @entity159 battled with @entity43 for the loose ball , which cannoned off the unfortunate @entity161 and into the net			2
@entity1 celebrates giving @entity24 the lead with a sumptuous free - kick against @entity18 in the first half the 27 - year - old celebrated his strike in his trademark manner by pointing to the heavens @entity1 ( far right ) watches on as his 20 - yard free - kick curls up and over the wall into the top left - hand corner @entity1 ( centre left ) is hugged by his @entity24 team - mates as that goal was his record - equalling 251st in @entity16 @entity1 's achievement is hailed by the @entity86 faithful with the scoreboard paying homage to his achievement @entity18 players celebrate their equaliser in the opening stages of the second half courtesy of an own goal from @entity161 @entity55 ( centre ) restored @entity24 's lead just minutes later , heading home a @entity51 free - kick @entity55 wheeled away in celebration of his strike as his impressive start to the season at the @entity197 giants continues the 22 - year - old ( right ) engaged in some samba - style dancing with his club and international team - mate @entity44 after his goal but before the stadium had a chance to whistle its displeasure in the usual fashion , @entity24 were back in front			1
@entity51 curled in a free - kick from the left and @entity55 rose highest to nod home his 11th league goal of the season			1
while @entity1 is the superstar and @entity53 is the star signing , @entity55 ’s own star has been rising higher this season			1
the @entity215 has become far more effective in front of goal this term , spurred on by his impressive @entity220 campaign			0
@entity45 's exile from the @entity24 side was ended by @entity223 for this match			2
his last appearance was in the @entity227 defeat at the @entity228 , where he gave away a penalty			0
whether he was missing because of some weak performances or a string of disciplinary offences has never been clarified by the @entity234 coach , but regardless , the punishment now appears to be over			0
@entity45 wo n't get away scot free with his role in the @entity18 goal , with both the @entity238 and @entity44 culpable of switching off , far more to blame than the actual player who put through his own net			2
@entity24 had dominated the first half , with only poor finishing and a couple of agricultural @entity18 challenges preventing them from further increasing their lead			1
a brilliant @entity62 save from @entity55 on the stroke of half - time was the closest they came to doing so , while @entity53 was denied after @entity1 had played a sublime ball to @entity47 , who sought out the @entity250			1
@entity50 ( left ) extended @entity24 's lead with a header just after the hour mark at the @entity86 @entity50 celebrates in a subdued manner after scoring against his former side on saturday night @entity1 is congratulated by @entity24 team - mates @entity55 and @entity53 after scoring his third goal of the night while @entity53 has had trouble finding the net , the first few weeks of his @entity24 career - after his lengthy suspension for biting ended - have been fruitful			1
he has created several opportunities for his team - mates , setting up both @entity24 goals in a man - of - the - match second half substitute appearance against @entity148			1
and he made another one here , eking out the perfect cross for @entity50 to head home from close range			2
the @entity271 diligently finished off the chance but looked mortified at having scored against his former side			0
he was the star performer in @entity18 ’s run to the @entity275 final and eventual triumph last season , although his start to life at @entity24 has been mixed			1
but whatever problems there are at @entity24 will have to be analysed another day			0
@entity1 made sure of that			2
he surged in to meet @entity55 ’s cross at full - length and poke home from a yard , to become the all - time top goalscorer in @entity16 history			1
if he had n’t reached it , @entity53 would have had an easy tap in			0
but @entity1 does reach things that he should n’t			0
no player will overtake him for many , many years			0
and at only 27 , he ’s got plenty more goals to add to his tally			0
he began the task immediately			0
@entity1 ’s third goal was the best of the night , a sprawling dribble , cutting from right to left , a quick - fire one two with @entity55 , a light touch to take it out of his feet , and then one of those low , placed drives from distance that he makes look so fantastically easy			1
that 's what @entity1 does			2
he makes things look fantastically easy - even the impossible			0
@entity1 applauds the 78,000 fans who witnessed his record - breaking feat at the @entity86 on saturday at full - time @entity1 is presented with the match ball and congratulated by his @entity24 team - mates in a presentation after the match			1
