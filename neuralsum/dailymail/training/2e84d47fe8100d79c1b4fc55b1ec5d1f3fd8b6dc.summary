cop - out ? a quarter of people admit to sending a text message telling their boss they are sick more workers are ditching the traditional sickie telephone call and texting their bosses instead			1
a quarter of employees admitted to sending their boss a text message rather than explaining their ailments over the phone			1
and one in six people even resorted to sending a @entity17 message instead of picking up the phone to their manager			1
but the survey of 10,000 people found almost three - quarters of bosses think that texting or emailing in sick is a cop - out			1
and 15 per cent of managers said an employee calling in sick because of a cold would arouse suspicion that they are lying to get a day off			2
this mistrust has led suspicious bosses to play workers at their own game , taking to social media to check on their staff , with 20 per cent admitting to checking their sick employee ’s @entity17 page			1
some managers admitted to calling their missing employees on a different phone number , with one in 20 even driving to their staff member ’s house			0
throwing a sickie : even if people do call in sick the survey found 25 per cent ham up their symptoms the research , by cough and cold medication @entity48 , found that those who do call exaggerate their symptoms with a quarter of people straining their voice or pretending to cough			2
a third of people are also wary of using @entity17 on a sick day , with 34 per cent saying they avoid using it to try not to raise their bosses ’ suspicions			2
but expect no sympathy from your colleagues when you return to work as the research showed thirteen per cent of people would consider a co-worker to be weak if they took a sick day for a cold			0
snooping : some bosses admitted checking their absent employees @entity17 to check if they were really ill director of the @entity70 at @entity71 , professor @entity72 , said : ' colds are actually more difficult to contract than people believe and there is no evidence that going to work will increase the instances in the community			0
' cold sufferers are at their most contagious up to three days before exhibiting any symptoms , so by the time they are feeling unwell , the chance of catching their illness is already reduced			0
' in fact , to catch a cold , close and prolonged contact to the virus is required which is why most colds are spread at home			0
' if you do fall ill , by proactively treating symptoms with an appropriate remedy and washing hands regularly , there is really no reason the common cold should get in the way of day - to - day responsibilities			0

one in six say they have sent their boss a @entity17 message explaining their ailments
