@entity1 , 58 , former manager of @entity7 care home in @entity9 , @entity10 , received a 12 month suspended sentence , after a patient died after falling out of his faulty bed			1
@entity14 , 86 , suffered a broken hip and died in hospital a month later , as @entity1 tried to orchestrate a ' cover up '			1
@entity18 @entity17 heard how @entity1 was warned prior to the fall by a member of staff that the brakes on mr @entity14 ’s bed were faulty			1
the pensioner had previously been assessed as having a high risk of falling after spending a month in hospital after a similar incident			2
the court was also told how @entity1 , whose sentence was suspended for two years , was responsible for the pensioner ’s welfare but did nothing to ensure his bed was fit for purpose			1
after discovering that mr @entity14 was in hospital , @entity35 , prosecuting , said the former care home manager tried to cover up the incident			2
the court heard that @entity1 instructed that a log in the maintenance book , that said the bed needed to be repaired , should be marked off , to give the appearance that work had been completed			1
@entity35 , prosecuting , said : ' as manager of @entity7 , she had a responsibility to care for mr @entity14			2
' she had failed to maintain a proper bed for him and following that effectively covered it up in the aftermath of the fall mr @entity14 suffered , where he sustained fracture injuries			2
' there was a complete absence of a rail and sufficient brakes on the bed and he was not the same again after the fall			0
' @entity60 , defending , commented : ' there were problems in the nursing home that pre-dated the defendant ’s employment			0

the court heard that @entity1 instructed that a log in the maintenance book , that said the bed needed to be repaired , should be marked off ' she has worked hard all her life and her loss of income means her house is now up for sale			1
' judge @entity77 said : ' your appearance before this court is a real tragedy			0
' you are a 58 year - old woman who has worked hard all her life			0
' there is no evidence that the injury sustained by mr @entity14 was the cause of or precipitated his death			2
' but it is clear to me that his final few weeks were made considerably more difficult than the weeks preceding the injury			0
' he was left bed - bound as a result of your neglect			0
' @entity14 was at the time an 86 year - old man who suffered from advanced dementia and as the manager you were responsible for his care			1
' he presented a significant risk of falling and it was essential that his treatment in the home included a bed with adequate rails and sturdy brakes			0
this was tragically not the case and he died of his injuries a few weeks later			0
