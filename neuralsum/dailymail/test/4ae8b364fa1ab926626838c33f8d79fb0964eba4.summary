one of the earliest spitfires ever to go into action has gone on sale for £ 2.5 million after spending 40 years buried in sand on the @entity5 beach it crashed on			1
the @entity8 version of @entity10 's famous design was among the first built in march 1940 but @entity11 , once flown by an airman involved in the @entity13 , never made it to the @entity15 as it crash - landed in may 1940			1
the fighter plane , dubbed the ballerina because of its grace in the skies , was being piloted by flying officer @entity20 over @entity21 when it was hit by a single bullet from a @entity25 @entity24 bomber			2
in 1980 the wreckage was discovered when part of it was spotted poking out from its sandy grave beached : @entity25 soldiers sitting on the @entity11 brought down on the wet sands at @entity43 by flying officer @entity20			1
it had been hit by a single bullet from a @entity25 @entity24 bomber			0
the plane was consumed by the sandy beach and remained there for 40 years captured : the fighter plane ( pictured left ) was being piloted by flying officer @entity20 ( right ) over @entity21 when it was hit by a single bullet from a @entity25 @entity24 bomber			1
@entity53 was then captured by the @entity54 and taken to the @entity31 prisoner of war camp @entity53 , a 32 - year - old @entity56 of the stock - broking dynasty flying his first combat mission , had no choice but to bring the aircraft down on the wet sands at @entity43 , despite radioing in to say ' tell mother i 'll be home for tea ! ' shortly before doing so			2
he was then captured by the @entity54 and also taken to the @entity31 prisoner of war camp , famous for @entity69			0
the plane became consumed by the sandy beach and remained there for the next 40 years			1
in 1980 the wreckage was discovered when part of it was spotted poking out from its sandy grave			1
it was corroded and covered in barnacles but amazingly still intact			0
the plane was dragged from the beach and taken to the @entity80 in @entity81			2
sadly , @entity20 died just a few weeks before the @entity11 was discovered			1
shortly before he passed away he is even said to have told his wife ‘ i wonder whatever happened to my @entity11 '			2
steeped in history : a technician with the propeller of the restored @entity11 ( pictured left ) at the @entity87 in @entity88 , @entity89 , and pilot @entity90 ( right ) , who is photographed with the @entity11 that he flew during the @entity92 second world war spitfire pilot @entity90 posed next to the @entity8 aircraft at the @entity87 earlier today			1
the @entity11 , one of the last of its kind remaining , is due to be auctioned for charity on july 9 and is expected to fetch up to £ 2.5million donation : the plane was bought by @entity100 billionaire philanthropist @entity99 after it was discovered in 1980			1
he had it restored to its original condition and now plans to donate the proceeds from the sale to the @entity105 and wildlife charity @entity107 the @entity108 after its restoration originally built at the @entity111 factory in @entity112 , @entity108 was delivered to @entity113 at @entity114 in march 1940 , one of the most celebrated squadrons in the @entity105			1
the @entity118 engine installed in @entity11 was built at @entity119 , @entity120 , on october 27 1939			1
during @entity11 's service with @entity113 it is known to have been flown by at least eight different pilots , and was almost certainly flown by the squadron 's commanding officer squadron leader @entity27 , later ' @entity126 fame			1
records show that @entity11 had a total flight time of 32 hours and 5 minutes at the time of its loss			2
eventually the plane was bought by @entity100 billionaire philanthropist @entity99 , who had it meticulously restored to its original condition by a team of expert engineers			1
mr @entity99 , an @entity137 - educated gold trader , owns both of the surviving @entity139			1
he has now listed the plane @entity53 piloted for sale through @entity145 auctioneers @entity143 's @entity142 , 75 years since the @entity15 , with an estimate of £ 2.5 million			1
he plans to donate the proceeds to the @entity105 and wildlife charity @entity107			0
the other @entity139 - @entity148 - will be gifted to the @entity88			1
mr @entity99 said : ' when my great childhood friend @entity150 and i embarked upon this project , it was to pay homage to those who @entity155 called @entity156 , the pilots who were all that stood between @entity160 's darkness and what was left of civilization			0
' these coming events are more than anything else , concrete gestures of gratitude and remembrance for those who prevailed in one of the most pivotal battles in modern history			0
' the return to @entity88 of @entity148 which was itself piloted by the heroic commander of @entity174 , is an act of love for @entity142 that began with my and @entity150 's mutual passion for aircraft and desire to enshrine a @entity142 legacy			0
' he added : ' the sale of @entity11 for charity is likewise an opportunity to share that passion with others and to benefit causes that have moved me since boyhood			2
' the @entity105 represents a way to honour that breed who gave so much for @entity142 when its existence was imperilled			0
' @entity194 , pilot and chief engineer at the @entity196 which undertook the project , said the original @entity11 is a remarkable piece of @entity92 history			1
he said : ' we have restored it over the last five years			2
it came to us quite literally in boxes of parts that had been removed from the beach in @entity5			1
' we spent five years restoring it back to its original state - it is unique in that sense			1
' we have seen spitfires at auction before , but many years ago			2
this one is particularly special , it is very unusual to see a spitfire like this go to auction			0
' it was a special project for me to be involved in			0
' experts say the plane offers a unique insight into the skirmishes @entity221 pilots faced			0
@entity222 , @entity143 's @entity142 deputy chairman , said : ' @entity143 is proud to be entrusted with the sale of this @entity11 ; a truly iconic aircraft which is symbol of the bravery of @entity156 in the @entity15 '			1
second world war spitfire pilot @entity90 ( pictured ) with the plane the cockpit of the restored @entity11 , which was one of the first spitfires ever built in 1940 , at @entity88 's @entity87 records show that the @entity231 ( pictured left and right ) had a total flight time of 32 hours and 5 minutes at the time of its loss when @entity238 commander @entity237 asked his flying ace @entity239 what he needed to win the @entity15 , he replied : ‘ a squadron of @entity139			1
’ the plane was so feared by the @entity238 that many @entity244 crews claimed to have been shot down by one when they had really been downed by the slower , more numerous , @entity246			0
the first plane shot down by a @entity11 was an @entity246 in 1939 in a friendly fire incident known as the @entity249			1
after d - day , flying ace @entity250 organised a supply run of @entity139 with barrels of beer slung under each wing to bring the ‘ necessities of life ’ to pilots on front - line airfields in @entity258			2
spitfires were occasionally painted pink to blend in with the sunset and sunrise when used for low - level reconnaissance flights			0
its pilot , mr @entity20 , who came from a banking dynasty , was part of the ill - fated bid for freedom from @entity272 after he had been captured by @entity25 forces			0
he did not manage to get away as he was a big man who could n't fit in the escape tunnel - which probably saved his life			0
mr @entity194 said : ' he got involved in the @entity13 , but luckily for him he did n't escape that day			0
most of his colleagues who did were then shot			0
' he came back to the @entity142 after the war			0
' @entity11 is now flyable once more and will take to the skies again at @entity88 in the @entity280 on may 23 and 24			2
' we have restored 18 spitfires over the years but have never been asked to restore one to such an exacting standard , ' mr @entity194 added			2
' i 've done the test flying and it was beautiful to fly			0
it really is a beautiful aircraft			0
it has flown at @entity88 and people there started calling it " the ballerina " , and that nickname has stuck			0
' mr @entity99 said he embarked on the project because he wanted to ' enshrine a @entity142 legacy '			0
@entity222 , deputy chairman of @entity143 's @entity142 , said : ' @entity143 is proud to be entrusted with the sale of this @entity11 ; a truly iconic aircraft which is symbol of the bravery of @entity156 in the @entity15			1
' we look forward to seeing this extraordinary @entity301 reach new heights at @entity303 , which will be a unique moment in auction house history			0
' the sale will take place in @entity145 on july 9			0
the @entity118 engine installed in @entity11 was built at @entity119 , @entity120 , in october 1939			2
the iconic aircraft 's sale will take place on july 9 taking to the skies : @entity11 will be flying again at @entity88 in the @entity280 on may 23 and 24 during @entity11 's service with @entity113 it is known to have been flown by at least eight different pilots , and was almost certainly flown by the squadron 's commanding officer squadron leader @entity27 , later ' @entity126 fame			1

the @entity8 version of the iconic plane was one of the first @entity139 to go into action , and was built in march 1940
but @entity11 never made it to @entity15 as it crash - landed on @entity5 beach and lay hidden for 40 years
at one point it was almost certainly flown by squadron leader @entity27 , later @entity329 fame
