if you ca n’t get rid of your pot belly , no matter how hard you try , blame your @entity3 gene			1
scientists believe the gene tells fat to gather around the middle , rather than the bottom and thighs			0
in other words , it influences whether someone is an ‘ apple ’ , with a big tummy , or a ‘ pear ’ , who widens out below the waist			0
it raises the possibility of pills that stop fat from being stored around the waist – meaning an end to pot bellies and muffin tops			2
@entity25 - shaped : scientists have discovered that a gene called @entity3 influences whether a person is an ' apple ' , with a big belly , or a ' pear ' with fat on their hips and thighs and the benefits would n’t just be cosmetic			1
the discovery of the ‘ apple - shape ’ gene is important because being an ‘ apple ’ who stores fat around the middle is worse for health than being a ‘ pear ’			2
unlike the fat that pads out pear - shapes , belly fat wraps around the body ’s vital organs and produces hormones and other chemicals that tamper with blood pressure , cholesterol , blood sugar levels			1
as a result it raises the risk of a host of health problems including heart disease , diabetes and strokes			1
to get to the bottom of how fat is stored , the @entity65 researchers studied zebra fish , tiny tropical fish whose transparent bodies make it see their inner workings			0
by using a dye that turned fat cells fluorescent , they showed that fish without a gene called @entity3 stored less fat around their abdomen than usual			2
muffin top : fat around the middle is dangerous to health as it wraps itself around vital organs , and raises the risk of health problems including heart disease , diabetes and strokes instead , the fat was stored in more a pear - shaped pattern , the journal @entity87 reports			1
the fish without apple - shape gene were also better at processing sugar – something that should cut the odds of diabetes			0
with the @entity3 - 1 gene thought to have a similar role in people , the research paves the way for a drug that stops people from growing big bellies			0
researcher dr @entity105 , of @entity106 , in @entity107 , said that this could also be good for health .			0

@entity3 gene influences whether a person is ' apple ' or ' pear ' shaped
@entity116 raises possibility of pills to stop fat being stored on the belly
unlike fat on hips and thighs , belly fat wraps itself around vital organs
raises risk of illnesses including heart disease , diabetes and stroke
