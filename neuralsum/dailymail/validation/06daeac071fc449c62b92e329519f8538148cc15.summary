the ponytail has gone , along with the modelling career and a shedload of money , but the ebullient @entity4 is not a man to look back and dwell			1
there has been a book too — ‘ just about the football club , it was a bit daft ’ — not to mention an app ‘ to keep results up to date , but it was n’t very good ’			1
meanwhile , owning @entity14 has turned the @entity17 club ’s extrovert chairman into an anxious , superstitious obsessive — ‘ my @entity18 is getting worse ’			1
@entity14 chairman @entity4 has been in charge at the club since 2006 @entity4 said he has no regrets about tweeting his disapproval of players @entity4 , who flirted with modelling as a 17 - year - old , shows he has no concerns in front of the camera suited in a verging - on - baggy pinstripe , @entity29 strides into his minimalist office at the training ground , past the empty bookshelves , and admits he has never sat at his huge , empty desk before			1
it turns out that the decorators have been in since he last made the trip from his @entity39 home			1
he likes it , especially the montage of family portraits which adorn the walls , even if they remind him how much he is missing wife @entity45 and their children : @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity50 , all under 10			1
there is an internal door to the manager ’s office , currently occupied by interim boss @entity56 following the reluctant severing of an eight - year on - off relationship with @entity59			2
‘ so you thought i ’d be in a tracksuit ? ’ he speaks in a soft @entity65 brogue but the words are delivered at rat - a - tat speed in a contradictory combination of dictatorial charm			2
his style is to cut to the chase			2
the answer to his question is yes			2
based on the evidence of an 11 - point @entity77 demolition of his players two months ago , the assumption is that @entity29 is an owner who likes to meddle			1
‘ i knew you ’d get to that , ’ said @entity4 , or @ @entity81			1
‘ give me 11 reasons not to talk about @entity77 ! @entity29 shows he is not shy in front of the camera as he pauses to take a selfie @entity59 led @entity14 to the @entity88 after finishing second in @entity17 in 2009 ‘ i have been caught saying things on @entity77 which i probably should n’t have but my personality has always been honest and direct			1
i make mistakes , i am impulsive			2
‘ what did the players think ? i did n’t need to ask			1
i spoke to them on friday and joked “ i ’m going to give you 11 great reasons on @entity77 why i ’m happy ” ( five wins in six since @entity59 ’s departure )			1
‘ they know where i ’m coming from and i do n’t think any of them could argue with my points			2
i understand it ’s not the done thing , but i did n’t buy a football club to live by the rules of the establishment			2
‘ am i a frustrated football manager ? no. i am an owner and a frustrated fan			2
if you look for a manager who says i said “ you must play so and so ” , you wo n’t find one			2
’ @entity4 left @entity111 for @entity112 with his family at 15 and by 29 had made a fortune from the property market , a large chunk of which went straight down the drain in the recession			1
the @entity14 chairman and director of football @entity119 celebrate after winning the @entity121 in 2014 @entity4 described getting relegated from the @entity88 in 2013 as his worst moment at the club at 17 he flirted with modelling , influenced by his girlfriend at the time , and a fact gleaned as he comfortably poses for photographs			1
‘ i had a ponytail , which my @entity130 used to do for me			1
@entity45 does n’t believe it when i tell her i used to be a model , but it was good money			2
’ another girlfriend tempted @entity29 to @entity135 and college			1
he lasted two weeks before heading back to @entity112			2
buying a football club was a dream toy for the boy in 2006 and has remained a source of pain and pleasure ever since			2
‘ i was 28 - 29 and at the top of my game , ’ recalled @entity4 , now 39			1
‘ then the recession came and the world nearly ended financially			1
it was tough , but the club kept me sane			2
‘ it ’s hard to name one best moment as there have been so many but the worst is easy			2
we were relegated from the @entity88 on 54 points two years ago			1
‘ we were 2 - 1 up ( against @entity154 ) with seven minutes to go and needed a draw			2
in the most horrific seven minutes in the history of the club they scored twice			0
@entity154 players celebrate @entity161 ' goal as @entity14 were relegated from the championship then manager @entity59 consoles @entity164 after @entity14 threw away a late lead ‘ i was watching from home — i have every game streamed to me			1
i ’m very tense in my chair , superstitious , and my @entity18 is over the top			0
you ’re not going to make this article about my @entity18 are you ? people will laugh			0
i was never like this at the start and now it ’s uncontrollable			0
‘ everything has to be in the same place on my desk and pointing in a certain direction			0
no - one can talk to me during a game			0
one of the guys who worked for me walked in and we lost so now no - one is allowed to			0
‘ when we were relegated i watched and reacted like a fan			0
then the financial implications come in			0
@entity185 , we have just lost £ 6million worth of revenue			0
’ the logistics of living in the @entity188 mean that @entity29 ’s visits to the £ 500,000 newly - refurbished training ground — rented at £ 1 a year from the school next door — are regular rather than frequent			1
email and telephone have to do the rest of the time			0
there is a lot to cram in , including this interview			0
halfway through there is a knock on the door			0
‘ i ’m busy , ’ shouts @entity29 as the door flies open regardless			1
‘ i ’m doing an interview			0
’ the beaming face of director of football @entity119 peers round the door			0
‘ how you doing love ? we need him ( @entity29 )			1
@entity14 director of football @entity119 interrupts the interview to borrow @entity29 during the interview @entity29 has his picture taken after @entity215 signs a new deal ‘ one minute , one photo			1
we ’re signing a new player love , and there ’s nothing more important than that			0
’ @entity29 is as helpless as the rest at stopping the irrepressible @entity119 and a short time - out is called , our photographer in hot pursuit			1
back at his desk , the chairman itemises the previous 24 hours , which involved meetings and the signing of six teenagers on pro contracts			1
the smile fades when the conversation turns to sir @entity236 ’s son @entity235 , who managed @entity14 twice under @entity29			1
it was like losing a member of the family			0
we spoke every day and we shared the highs and lows			0
it ’s still quite raw			0
‘ we have to get the next appointment right			0
the club has been stressing me this season , i have aged			0
but it ’s enjoyable again			0
i ’m in the luxury position that the guys in situ are banging down the door			0
’ @entity59 left the club for a second time in february - @entity29 likened it losing a member of the family @entity29 and @entity119 pose together for a picture as the director of football gives the thumbs - up the new manager will be expected to recruit young , cheap players , produce a winning team and be prepared to lose them as the business plan is one big departure a year — the club have generated £ 30m of sales under @entity29			1
@entity265 was the £ 5m cash cow last year , a record £ 1m signing from @entity267 sold on to @entity268 , sparking another angry tweet from @ @entity81 when @entity268 missed a due payment			0
there could be new projects in the pipeline			0
a follow - up book to his first tome , from @entity277 to obsession , perhaps ? ‘ it was me and a @entity280 , ’ revealed @entity4			1
‘ and then i employed someone to write it			0
they wrote it badly from an @entity286 point of view			0
‘ the fans liked it and it sold 10,000 but there was nothing about my personal life in there			0
i have n’t written my autobiography yet — now that would be an interesting book ! ’			0
