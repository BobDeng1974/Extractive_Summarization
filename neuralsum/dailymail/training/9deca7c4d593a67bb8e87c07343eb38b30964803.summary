by @entity1 reporter published : 14:21 est , 28 february 2014 @entity3 : 17:32 est , 28 february 2014 a high school student has stunned his girlfriend by renting a billboard to ask her to be his prom date			2
@entity9 gasped and screamed after noticing the massive poster at one of the busiest intersections in @entity13 , @entity8 bore her face and the question : ' @entity9 , prom with me ? ' footage taken by friends shows her hugging her boyfriend , @entity20 , after seeing the billboard - before saying yes to his proposal			1
' it was about the biggest thing i could think of besides renting a plane			0
' so he rented a @entity42 billboard for two days to post the message , which included his proposal , their images and ' yes ' and ' no ' tick boxes			0
the pair have only been dating for six months , yet he said he started planning the surprise three months ago			1
his girlfriend said she never expected anything quite so extravagant			0
' i was thinking something in my driveway or something in front of my friends , ' @entity9 said , smiling			2
' not in front of all of @entity13			0
' success : @entity9 , who has been dating @entity20 for six months , gave him the answer he was hoping for a @entity42 spokesperson said that @entity20 purchased space on the digital billboard for two days , and that the average three - day rate for a digital billboard in that location is around $ 1,200			1
' advertising rates vary depending on location , size , market , campaign duration [ and ] demand , ' she added			0
' given all the expenses associated with going to prom - tickets , attire , flowers , dinner , maybe shared limo rental , etc. - the cost of the digital billboard could be minor in the grand scheme of the overall cost of @entity82 ! ' @entity20 said ' it was n't that big of a deal ' and is now looking forward to the prom in april			1
the happy couple later posed beneath another billboard that read : ' @entity9 are going to prom ! ' see below for video			2
