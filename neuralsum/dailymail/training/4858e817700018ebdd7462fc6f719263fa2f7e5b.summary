by @entity0 @entity1 : 01:58 est , 29 december 2013 @entity2 : 07:52 est , 29 december 2013 conservators in the @entity4 have discovered a box full of negatives taken by the ill - fated @entity7 between 1914 and 1917 , preserved in ice			1
a team from the @entity11 @entity10 restoring an old exploration camp discovered the clumped - together cellulose nitrate negatives in a small box in captain @entity17 's @entity16 hut			1
the @entity7 was marooned in 1915 after their ship broke free of its mooring during a storm			1
they were n't rescued until 1917			2
@entity21 : @entity22 , chief scientist and geologist looks south with @entity24 in the background on ice : this photo was taken from the deck of the @entity29 looking @entity30 to @entity24 stranded : this photo is from a group adhered together and found in captain @entity17 's 1911 expedition base , @entity16 , @entity4 , by @entity10 ( @entity11 ) conservators the hut was established by @entity17 for his doomed @entity36 to the @entity37			1
@entity17 and his team died in 1913 of starvation and cold on their return trip			2
it was next used by the @entity7 to leave supplies for famed explorer sir @entity45			2
it 's believed the @entity7 's photographer took the photographs , which were never processed			2
that mission failed when their ship , the @entity29 , broke free of its moorings and left 10 members of the @entity7 stranded			1
ill - fated : members of the @entity7 before they were stranded in @entity4 artist 's interpretation : this depiction of @entity7 members was drawn and painted , probably by @entity60 , from material supplied to the artist by surviving members of the @entity7 they were marooned until 1917 , enduring illness , psychological trauma and extreme weather			1
despite their misfortune , the team set about its work anyway , laying supplies down for @entity45 's crossing			0
what they did not know was that their efforts were in vain			0
broke free : the @entity29 was intended to be the @entity7 's main accommodation but broke free of its moorings during a blizzard , stranding 10 men @entity45 had been forced to abandon his crossing after his ship , the @entity84 , was crushed in pack ice			1
exhausted , frostbitten and suffering from scurvy , five members of the team became stranded at @entity24 after successfully depositing supplies for @entity45 's mission			0
the ice was too thin to risk a return to @entity16 and they subsisted on a diet of seal meat until two of the team decided to risk the ice			0
the pair were never seen again			0
a third member succumbed to the conditions and was buried in the ice			0
the remaining three at last reunited with the other four party members and were finally rescued by @entity45 aboard a restored @entity29 in 1917			1
it was only then that they discovered the futility of their efforts in laying the stores for the journey that never happened			0
the conservation team from the @entity11 @entity10 separated the negatives and discovered 22 images			2
many of them were badly damaged but the @entity10 says many landmarks around @entity116 are recognizable			0
preserved : this photo of @entity22 , chief scientist , on board the @entity29 , as part of @entity45 's @entity7 , had never been seen before conservators discovered century - old negatives in @entity4 @entity123 , @entity10 's executive director , said the new photos are a historic treasure			1
' it 's an exciting find and we are delighted to see them exposed after a century , ' @entity123 said			0
the photographs show new views of @entity21 , @entity116 , and two pictures of the expedition 's chief scientist @entity22 , linking them definitively to the @entity7 expedition and not the earlier @entity36 .			0

conservators in @entity4 have discovered negatives almost 100 years old
the images depict member of the ill - fated @entity7
they were found in a hut that once *belonged* to captain @entity17 in @entity16
the @entity7 was stranded in @entity4 when their ship broke free of its moorings in 1915
@entity147 died before they were finally rescued in 1917
