by @entity0 published : 08:03 est , 20 september 2012 updated : 17:26 est , 20 september 2012 there 's bad news for the entire female cast of @entity4			0
when it comes to attracting men , less is more where makeup is concerned			0
almost three - quarters of @entity9 men say they prefer women to wear very little make - up - in the style of the @entity13 rather than that of former @entity4 star @entity15 - according to a poll			1
almost three - quarters of @entity9 men say they prefer women to wear very little make - up , in the style of the @entity13 , right , rather than former @entity4 girl @entity15 , left			1
although 93 per cent of men surveyed agreed a small amount of make - up could improve a woman 's look , just a quarter ( 27 per cent ) said they preferred the caked - on @entity4 image to the demure tones of the @entity13			1
female stars including @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31 were highlighted as being particularly attractive in a natural way			0
and @entity15 , @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35 were deemed too heavily made - up by the majority of males polled			0
interestingly men from the south were found to be the biggest advocates of the subtle look , while northern males confessed to being more attracted to women who liked wearing substantial makeup			2
tv presenter @entity28 's natural look , left , was generally preferable to men than to the heavily made - up style of singer @entity34 , right too much foundation was viewed as the biggest turn off , closely followed by streaky fake tan , ridiculous false lashes and tiger - like false nails			1
ironically , nearly half of the men polled ( 48 per cent ) said they used beauty products including moisturiser , eye - rollers and teeth whitener in a bid to look their best for the ladies			2
a spokesman from @entity65 , the online casiono that conducted the survey of 800 men , said the results may show men to be less cynical than first thought			0
he said : ' men are often accused of preferring women who apply bold , eye - catching make - up , yet what our poll has found is that for most too much slap is a reason to take a step back			1
' while nearly all agreed that applying a little makeup could help accentuate a woman 's best features , the vast majority believed that less was more when it came to presentation â€“ which may be bad news for makeup manufacturers			1
' most men surveyed felt @entity33 , left , wears too much make up , and that the understated style of @entity92 's wife @entity93 is more attractive he concluded : ' beauty is in the eye of the beholder , and there is no right or wrong amount of make - up to wear , but if you 're out on the pull , particularly in the south of @entity105 , you may wish to ditch the make - up in the hunt for the dream man			1
' natural ? pah ! looking this ' natural ' takes just as long as looking ' unnatural ' , says @entity111 's @entity110			2
but what men think of as ' natural ' actually takes a lot of effort , according to one make - up expert			1
@entity110 , @entity111 's @entity117 , told @entity118 : ' so , boys , you may think my flawless skin and rosy cheeks were a gift from god ...			0
well , you are very , very wrong ! ' the " natural " look takes just as long as the " unnatural look "			2
' you see , to get this face , we have prepped using a moisturiser , primed , using a primer and then perfected with a foundation , concealer , highlighter and powder ! ' it 's the precise and timely application of these products that creates our flawless looking skin			0
then there 's the blush			0
' getting this natural glow takes military application ! ' it 's all about the positioning of where you apply it ; not too high , not too low			2
not too round , not too angled ! ' and did i mention that if you get your blusher wrong , you ca n't just rub it off , you have to take your entire face of make - up off and start again ! ' i have n't even mentioned the monthly tinting , waxing and threading that our facial hair goes through to finish our looks			1
but that 's another story ! ' so boys , the truth is , being beautiful takes time			0
it 's just a good job us girls have got it down to a tee			0

93 per cent agreed make - up improves a woman 's appearance
men from north of @entity9 more likely to prefer women in lots of make - up
but what men think of as ' natural ' actually takes a lot of work , says expert
