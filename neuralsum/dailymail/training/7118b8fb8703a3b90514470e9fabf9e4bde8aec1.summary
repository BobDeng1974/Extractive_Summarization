@entity0 , a 21 - year - old racing driver from @entity1 , is in contention to drive alongside the likes of @entity4 at the @entity5 after her grandfather said he would pay to turn her dream into reality			1
@entity9 , whose @entity11 aspirations are supported by the prime minister , would become only the sixth woman ever to take part in a @entity11 weekend			1
her opportunity has come about in extra-ordinary circumstances , after @entity17 went into administration at the end of last month			2
the administrators have since launched a ‘ crowd - funding ’ project whereby the public can contribute towards a target of £ 2.35million that would allow the team , who have missed the last two races , to compete at the championship decider in @entity29 on sunday week			1
@entity0 could be given a chance to make her @entity11 debut for @entity17 the 21 - year - old 's grandfather could pay £ 35,000 for her to race at the @entity29 first practice session @entity9 is hoping to line up alongside fellow brits @entity4 , @entity35 and @entity36 @entity37 : the @entity38 became the first female to race in @entity11 at @entity40			1
@entity41 : another @entity38 , raced 17 times in 1974 - 76 and only female to achieve a top - six finish			2
@entity45 : the @entity46 was multi-talented , captaining women ’s @entity48 ski team in 1968 and 1972 and driving in three grands prix			0
desire @entity51 : @entity52 for home grand prix in @entity55 in 1981 , but retired after her car was damaged			0
@entity58 : @entity59 through @entity60 and f3000 ranks , though she never qualified for @entity11 grid			2
since opening on friday , the scheme has secured more than half the required money			0
in return for contributing , the fans are given ‘ rewards ’ — including bits of old chassis , steering columns and sundry unneeded bits lying around the closed factory in @entity74 , @entity75			0
@entity9 ’s grandfather , @entity76 , a retired @entity77 sergeant , saw an opportunity to get @entity9 her @entity11 debut			1
he wrote to the administrators , @entity82 , offering to pay £ 35,000 in exchange for @entity9 driving in the first practice session on the friday of the grand prix weekend			1
‘ i am really hoping the administrators come back with a positive response , ’ said @entity76 , an aviation lover who passed his helicopter pilot ’s licence seven years ago aged 66			0
‘ it would give the whole sport a great lift and open people ’s eyes to see a woman in an @entity11 car again			1
‘ a lot of women might not want to watch a race with their husbands when all they see is a list of men			0
this could focus their attention , just as it did when @entity104 raced in @entity105			0
audience figures there went up by 15 per cent overnight			0
‘ @entity108 is the best woman driver in the world and i believe she could run in midfield in a good @entity11 team			1
but for now we are just trying to get a drive in one practice session			0
’ @entity116 , an associate director of @entity82 , confirmed they had ‘ received the offer and have spoken to @entity108 ’s backers ’			2
i understand that @entity121 sought an assurance from @entity9 ’s grandfather and manager that she meets the criteria for an @entity127 super-licence , a prerequisite for @entity11			1
she should comfortably qualify for the paperwork such is her pedigree in lower formulas			0
at 16 , she was the youngest ever driver in @entity133 before becoming the first female winner of a @entity133 series in 2010			2
she has driven in @entity136 and @entity133 3.5 , arguably the toughest series outside @entity11			2
@entity138 has backed @entity9 to become the sixth female driver to take part in a @entity11 weekend @entity11 driver @entity35 and @entity142 track and field athlete @entity141 are among @entity9 's sporting heroes but despite her success , @entity9 , who left school after her gcses to pursue her driving career , works as a labourer — steel - fixing and driving diggers — when she is not racing			1
@entity76 says he is not cash - rich and fears his plan may be scuppered by rival bidders with deeper pockets			0
one driver available after his team @entity157 folded is @entity142 ’s @entity36 , who is backed by hefty investors led by his multi-millionaire father @entity159			1
but @entity76 said : ‘ even if the administrators get someone else for the race , qualifying and the two other practice sessions , there is no reason not to include @entity108 for the first session			0
it is important that they make up their minds soon because she needs to get on the simulator from now until @entity29			0
’ @entity9 is no stranger to the limelight , having accompanied @entity138 on a trade delegation to @entity174 two years ago			1
the pm strongly supports her quest , saying : ‘ @entity108 has my full backing in her desire to compete at @entity11			2
‘ no woman has raced in @entity11 for nearly 40 years and not only would it be great for @entity108 and great for @entity142 but it would be great for @entity11			1
’ by taking part in two practice sessions this season @entity182 , of @entity183 , became the first female participant since @entity58 failed to qualify for the @entity188 @entity5 on april 4 , 1992			2
and only two women have started a race : @entity37 and @entity41 , in the 50s and 70s respectively			0
speaking to @entity192 last year , @entity9 , whose sporting heroes are @entity35 and @entity141 , said : ‘ i do n’t think there is anything stopping a female getting into @entity11 , but i do n’t think a female should be there simply because she is female			1
’ @entity200 boost for @entity201 as he edges out @entity4			0

@entity0 could be given the chance to take part for @entity17
@entity138 has backed @entity9 to make @entity11 debut
@entity9 's grandfather has offered administrators @entity82 £ 35,000 for @entity142 female driver to participate
the 21 - year - old would become sixth woman to take part in @entity11 weekend
