@entity2 ’s @entity1 hopes were left hanging by a worn racket string when he finished an extraordinary twilight deciding set with it poised at 7 - 7 and the clock glowing at 9.39pm			1
the @entity8 champion will need to come back on sunday for a sudden - death shootout , the like of which he has never known before in a @entity10 , if he is to squeeze his way past the gritty @entity13 @entity12			2
@entity2 will resume at 3 - 6 , 6 - 3 , 6 - 3 , 4 - 6 , 7 - 7 in his third round with three hours and 27 minutes already played , having traipsed home to bed wondering why he had not wrapped things up in time for a hearty supper			1
great scot : @entity2 is a study of concentration as he plays a backhand on saturday night on a roll : the @entity25 no 1 will sleep with the game at 7 - 7 as they battle for a place in the fourth round he led 3 - 0 in the fourth set and 2 - 0 in the fifth - he also led by a break of serve in all five sets - and faces a huge test of nerve as the opportunity to go deep into this tournament presents itself			1
clutching at his left hamstring and moving stiffly at times towards the end , continually chuntering at himself during changeovers , he could not put away the highly skilled @entity13 , who deserves plenty of credit for refusing to go quietly			2
@entity12 even managed to get a break up at 3 - 2 , only for the occasion to get to him and allow @entity2 to hold on amid cliff - edge drama that should never really have been necessary			1
@entity2 so rarely loses these kind of matches at @entity10 , and this was further evidence just how tough the whole journey returning from back surgery has been			0
from dominating the fourth set , it seemed he got distracted by trying to finish things off for the night , and the price is that he must come back this afternoon to finish what is the longest fifth set of his career			0
@entity2 needed to produce an immaculately timed backhand to save a break - point at 6 - 6 which would have allowed @entity12 to serve for the match			1
it truly was an evening of living dangerously			0
wavered : @entity12 took the first and fourth sets while @entity2 claimed the second and third then , with adrenalin surging through both players , he had a simpler backhand from mid-court in the next game that would have given him match - point , only to fractionally drag it wide			1
by the close he was gesturing to suggest he was struggling to see the ball , and it required all his bloody - minded determination to save himself , plus the assistance of the tour physio at three consecutive changeovers , who was called out to administer a rub to his thighs			0
everyone could have used a calming massage after this one			0
he needs to steel himself once again , but the fact remains that his self - belief is not quite the same on clay as it is on other surfaces			0
@entity2 knew full well what a dangerous opponent he faced , having been thrashed by him in @entity90 four years ago , and knowing that the @entity13 was coming into this on a six - match winning streak			2
his looping groundstrokes give him high net clearance and consistency , and at the start he was swift to attack two of @entity2 ’s weaker areas in quickly recovering from an early break down to reel off five games and take the opener			0
@entity2 ’s second serve has looked a little vulnerable this week and his opponent attacked anything short			0
time out : @entity2 receives treatment from the trainer for a thigh injury but plays on ups and downs : @entity2 tries to see the lighter side of things during a tumultuous third round match he also benefited from erratic forehand play from the @entity25 no 1 , who repeatedly drove the ball into the net , especially when he was pushed out wide , which can sometimes be the case			2
with no heavyweight figure in his box like @entity122 , we saw more of the tendency to turn around and curse in his corner ’s direction — something which never bodes well			0
waiting game : @entity2 will finish the match in the morning a backhand volley into the net sealed the opener on @entity12 ’s fifth set - point , but the heart - ening factor for @entity2 was that he always knew he would have openings against the @entity13 ’s serve , not his strongest suit			1
the @entity138 regrouped impressively and broke for 2 - 0 , only for @entity12 to return the compliment three games later			2
@entity2 attacked the @entity12 serve again and when he broke for 4 - 2 was able to serve out and level the match			1
in the third , @entity2 made a judicious foray to the net after a deep drive to break for 3 - 2 and then rubbed in the advantage with another break at 5 - 3 to put himself in firm control of proceedings with the sun beginning to set			1
at 3 - 0 in the fourth he was in utter command , then threw in two double - faults and lost his service rhythm — and the next five out of six games — to send it into a decider			2
today promises to be another white - knuckle ride , albeit a much briefer one			0
@entity159 ’s doubles run came to an end as he and @entity162 partner @entity161 lost to @entity163 and @entity164 in the third round			0
@entity2 was playing at this stage at @entity1 for the first time , but the defending champion @entity169 won 6 - 3 , 6 - 1 in 49 minutes .			1
