prize - winning @entity0 was actually poisoned after he returned to his home country of @entity3 a prize - winning @entity4 allegedly ' murdered ' at @entity6 was actually poisoned after he returned to his home country of @entity3 , according to @entity7			1
three - year - old @entity8 collapsed and died at his owner 's home in @entity11 , @entity3 , 24 hours after winning a silver medal in his class at the world 's biggest dog show			1
his devastated owner @entity16 , 34 , was convinced the pedigree dog must have been given the beef laced with poison at the event - as it was the only time the dog was alone			2
but @entity7 , which runs @entity6 , said toxicology reports revealed the fast - acting poison was consumed 28 hours after the dog show			1
@entity25 , @entity26 , said two types of insecticides - called aldicarb and carbofuran - were to blame for @entity8 's death			1
she said : ' there has been a lot of concern about whether the poisoning happened at @entity6 and we are now able to reassure all dog lovers who came to @entity6 that this could not have been possible and it is highly likely that the poisons , thought to be on a piece of beef , were eaten in @entity3 , shortly before @entity8 's death			1
' we have had confirmation , including from independent toxicologists , that the poisons identified in the toxicology report - carbofuran and aldicarb - are fast acting			1
' severe clinical symptoms would usually occur within half an hour to three hours			0
' considering we are told that @entity8 showed the first clinical signs usually associated with these two poisons shortly before his death in @entity3 , late on friday march 6 night , leading to the immediate call for veterinary attention , we must conclude that it is inconceivable that he could have been poisoned at @entity6 on thursday march 5 , some 28 to 36 hours earlier			1
' she said the poison was believed to have been given on a piece of beef that was largely undigested when the autopsy was performed on saturday march 7 - the day @entity8 died			2
the @entity26 then pointed out that food is usually absorbed in dogs within six hours			0
three - year - old @entity8 collapsed and died at his owner 's home in @entity11 , @entity3 , 24 hours after winning a silver medal in his class at world 's biggest dog show , pictured with @entity16 's son @entity69 her comments were made amid fears that at least six dogs were deliberately poisoned at the world famous show			1
but she said there was no evidence that any of the dogs taken ill at @entity6 were actually given poison while at the show			2
' we must stress that despite reports to the contrary which have caused a lot of concern to dog lovers , absolutely no dog has been shown to have been sick at or after @entity6 due to poison ingested at the show , there are no veterinary reports or evidence to support this notion , and no official reports of poisoning have been made to the police , ' she said			1
' we have a lot of security measures in place to protect the dogs at our show and we continually review our procedures because the welfare and safety of the dogs is our first and main priority			0
' regardless of the fact that the poison was not ingested at @entity6 a dog has very sadly died and we must now respect the owners ' privacy and give them time to grieve			2
' @entity8 suffered a fit and fell into a coma before dying in @entity16 's arms back at the family home in the city of @entity11 , in @entity3			2
two types of insecticides - called aldicarb and carbofuran - were to blame for @entity8 's death she revealed a post mortem by a vet found cubes of meat laced with a toxin in his stomach and thought he may have been targeted at the show at @entity131 's @entity130			1
the family 's vet dr @entity132 said @entity8 fell ill so suddenly that it is more likely he ate the toxins shortly before he died			0
speaking for the first time about the tragedy , he told the @entity138 : ‘ i doubt that it happened at @entity6			0
i think it ’s unlikely because of the long time delay			0
‘ i am surprised at everyone saying that this was the case			0
’ @entity143 , health information officer at the @entity7 , added : ' regardless of the specifics surrounding this particular tragic incident , where @entity8 's owners suspect malicious intent , this tragedy has shone the spotlight very firmly on the issue of poisoning			1
' it is important that dog owners know that the majority of poison related deaths and illnesses in dogs in the @entity159 are accidental			0
' some accidents could potentially be avoided if dog owners were to be aware of the common household and garden items that can be harmful to dogs , including chocolate , raisins , onions , some pesticides and garden plants , detergents and many human medicines			0
' the three - year - old @entity173 setter was ' best friend ' to the couple 's son , @entity69			0
the family have vowed to find the person responsible for his ' slow and painful ' death @entity16 ( pictured with @entity69 and the litter @entity8 was born part of ) said she and her son are struggling to cope with the dog 's death aldicarb and carbofuran are carbamate insecticides which are used in agriculture - but are not approved for use in the @entity189			1
@entity190 , senior information scientist for @entity191 , said : ' we understand that the toxicology report says carbofuran and aldicarb , toxic carbamate pesticides - which are no longer approved for use in the @entity189 - were found			2
' we would expect the clinical effects , if ingested by a dog , to be rapid in onset ; normally between half an hour and three hours			0
' after this time a combination of clinical effects , if the toxins were taken in sufficient quantities , would likely be present , including weakness , collapse , diarrhoea , slow heart rate , difficulty in breathing and excessive salivation			0
