by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter an independent report released friday says the @entity4 failed to follow parts of the federal law that governs sexual harassment on campus when handling the case of a former swimmer 's suicide			1
the report concludes administrators on the @entity15 campus should have investigated 20 - year - old @entity17 's 2011 death after her parents raised questions about the events leading to her suicide			1
@entity17 alleged she was sexually assaulted during her freshman year by as many as three football players , 16 months before she died			1
the school previously said it did n't act sooner under the 40 - year - old @entity27 law or more recent @entity30 @entity29 instructions because neither @entity17 nor her parents sought a police investigation and did n't respond to a later request for information			1
failed : school administrators learned about the alleged february 2010 incident after @entity38 - born swimmer @entity37 , pictured , recounted it to a rape crisis counselor during an online chat conversation and a campus therapist @entity4 president @entity42 ( left ) signed an executive order that requires all university employees to report claims of sexual abuse the case was referred to @entity15 police in late january after @entity50 's ' @entity49 ' raised numerous questions about the university 's response			1
the report makes no specific recommendations for possible changes but instead provides a detailed accounting of the university 's response			0
among its primary findings : the university lacked a policy advising employees of their obligations to report suspected sexual assault and harassment , which federal law suggested			1
university president @entity42 took action on that very issue tuesday with an executive order that requires all university employees other than those legally bound by confidentiality to report such claims to the university 's @entity27 coordinator			0
' it became clear to us that we needed a stronger , more transparent policy , ' he said at a news conference friday			0
alleged victim : despite their legal obligation to report possible sexual violence to police , the college did n't tell law enforcement about @entity17 's claims , according to @entity50 's ' @entity49 ' the @entity27 coordinator and local police should have been alerted to @entity17 's claims in november 2012 after a public records request by her parents produced documents alluding to a possible attack , the report determined			1
the @entity27 coordinator also should have been told about the possible assault nine months earlier when athletics department employees learned about it in a local news story , the law firm concluded			2
@entity4 curators received the report , by the @entity104 law firm of suburban @entity105 , during a closed - door session in @entity107 on friday			2
after the meeting , @entity108 apologized to @entity17 's ' family , friends and teammates			0
' ' we 're truly sorry for this heartbreaking tragedy and apologize for whatever shortcomings may have occurred on our part , and our treatment of her while she was one of our students , ' he said			0
' you remain in our thoughts and prayers as a university community			0
' @entity4 football : former @entity4 football receiver @entity127 backed up her account and said he saw cell phone video of three of his teammates raping her in a dark room as she sobbed hysterically @entity108 also said the report shows that ' our university employees acted in good faith with the best interests of @entity37 and her family in this matter			1
there was no attempt to cover anything up			0
' other sexual assault cases have been linked to @entity4 's athletic department , including former running back @entity146 's 2010 conviction for sexually assaulting a tutor in her sleep			2
basketball player @entity150 transferred in 2012 after two sex assault claims against him went public , though he was never charged			0
the report 's release also follows a turbulent week for @entity4 athletics , in which transfer @entity155 was kicked off the men 's basketball team thursday after two arrests and star receiver @entity160 was dismissed from the football team moments after the curators ' meeting friday following an investigation into a suspected burglary			1
no charges were filed against either man			0
@entity17 , who grew up outside @entity168 , killed herself at a @entity170 psychiatric hospital after withdrawing from classes midsemester and being diagnosed with borderline personality disorder , a disease her family said she struggled with before college but which went undiagnosed			0
the @entity0 normally does n't name alleged victims of sexual assault , but @entity17 's parents have publicly discussed the case at length , as has the university			2
in a diary entry found by her family after her death , @entity17 wrote she had told an academic counselor in @entity4 's athletic department about the rape while hospitalized in @entity170			2
the report 's five - lawyer investigative team interviewed the counselor , who longer works for the school , and determined that ' it can not be definitively concluded that a report of sexual assault ... was made to any employee or official of the university while @entity17 was alive , other than medical personnel			1
' the ex-counselor told investigators @entity17 did n't mention a rape , and that the counselors spoke to her while in a noisy restaurant			2
' it is possible that either because of a miscommunication or an inability to hear everything , there was an unintentional disconnect ' between the two women , the report said .			0

an independent investigation determined that the @entity4 failed to follow federal law that governs sexual harassment when it did n't report the alleged rape of swimmer @entity37
a rape crisis counselor and a campus therapist first learned of the alleged february 2010 incident after @entity17 recounted it to them later that year
but law enforcement was not notified and the school never launched an investigation
@entity17 committed suicide in june 2011 , about 16 months after the alleged assault
@entity232 football receiver @entity127 said he saw video of three of his teammates raping her in a room as she sobbed hysterically
