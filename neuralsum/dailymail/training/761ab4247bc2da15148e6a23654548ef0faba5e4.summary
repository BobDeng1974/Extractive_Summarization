whether you are grabbing a takeaway coffee , or flicking through a magazine , it is almost impossible not to encounter adverts or brands			0
but a prototype headset that can block out brands has been created , meaning that people may be able to ‘ opt out of corporate influence ’ in the future			1
a group of four students developed the device during a hackathon , to help people who ‘ feel helpless against the dominance of ads in society today			2
the ' @entity25 for @entity26 ' can be seen blurring out the logo on a coffee cup ( left ) while the image on the right does n't have the feature switched on the headset is called ‘ @entity40 ’ and comprises a pair of goggles with a seven inch display inside and a camera , running on @entity37 and @entity39 software			0
it uses computer vision to recognise brands , such as @entity44 , which are logged in a database			1
once any of the recognisable brands come into view , the system pixelates them			2
‘ it ’s @entity25 for real life , ’ the team of computer scientists said			1
they developed the idea at the @entity55 's @entity57 hackathon , describing the headset as : ‘ a technology demonstration that envisions a future in which consumers can use augmented reality to opt out [ of ] corporate influence			2
’ the headset is called ‘ @entity40 ’ ( pictured ) and comprises a pair of goggles with a seven inch display inside and a camera , running on @entity37 and @entity39 software the team originally set out to overlay brands with generic labels such as ‘ cereal ’ instead of ‘ @entity74 , ’ for example but ran out of time , as they built the headset over one weekend and only spent $ 80 ( £ 53 ) the headset is called ‘ @entity40 for @entity26 '			1

the headset cost $ 80 ( £ 53 ) and was built over one weekend			1
despite a positive response to an ad - free world , its creators say there are no plans to use or sell the gadget			1
team member @entity105 - @entity104 , a @entity106 student at @entity107 , said : ‘ this idea was inspired by the @entity110 tv show @entity109 , in which one episode features a future in which certain people are literally blocked out from the lives of others using augmented reality technology			2
’ the team decided to use a similar idea to empower people and let them block out advertising , which mr @entity104 described as ‘ an eyesore and overwhelmingly present in society today ’			0
they originally set out to overlay brands with generic labels such as ‘ soda ’ instead of ‘ @entity127 , ’ for example but ran out of time , as they built the headset over one weekend and only spent $ 80 ( £ 53 )			1
‘ we also planned to target billboards and full - adverts , but also did not finish that in the competition			0
’ the team also considered replacing adverts with artwork			0
while the headset was only developed to demonstrate the potential of current technology in augmented reality , it was received positively by people keen to block out adverts from their lives			1
mr @entity104 said : ‘ around 30 people tried the headset on when we demoed it at @entity57 , and almost every one smiled or laughed at the effect			0
‘ the positive response from the @entity155 has been wonderful			0
’ there are no plans to sell or use the headset ( pictured ) in day - to - day life			1
it is purely intended as ‘ a statement about both technology and society '			0
however , it has been very well received			0
‘ i think that currently people feel helpless against the dominance of ads in society today , ' mr @entity104 said once any of the recognisable brands come into view , the system pixelates them			1

‘ possibly the response to the project has been so overwhelming because it has helped people imagine a world in which technology like this is used to empower individuals as one that is not too far off			0
’ team member @entity191 told @entity192 : ‘ the response to our technology indicates that people really identify with the goal of blocking ads in the real world			1
‘ i think many people have realised that brands are everywhere in our world , and the ability to exert some control over our surroundings rather than be helpless to the ads is empowering			2
’ ‘ people have been looking for practical uses of augmented reality , and i think that this , or variations of it , could be highly demanded			0
‘ people want the same freedom they have in their browsers , in the real world			2
’ despite this , there are no plans to sell or use the headset in day - to - day life			1
it is purely intended as ‘ a statement about both technology and society			0
’ when asked whether the technology could one day be embedded into a technology similar to @entity228 , mr @entity191 said : ‘ i do think that developers will go ahead and build this technology for whatever augmented reality devices come out in the future			0

headset was created by students over a weekend for $ 80 ( £ 53 )
it uses computer vision to recognise certain brands such as @entity44
logos are *automatically* pixelated when they come into the goggle 's view
computer scientists describe their **invention** as ' @entity253 for real life '
people have responded positively to the **invention** and an ad - free world
but students say there is no plan to develop the headset further or sell it
