the secret device was developed quickly and secretly but was never used in action during the 1982 conflict			2
its existence was revealed a year later to @entity15 in a january 1983 letter , marked ' @entity17 and @entity1 @entity18 , ' from @entity19			1
attack : an @entity6 jet flies in to attack @entity1 ships , but it was revealed today @entity1 developed a laser to dazzle them and sent it across to the @entity3 tragedy : @entity27 sinking in @entity28 after it was hit on may 24 , 1982 by an @entity6 bomb the then newly - appointed defence secretary was briefing the iron lady about the @entity34 's laser weaponry , and told the @entity36 leader @entity1 already had one			1
flashback : then defence secretary @entity19 revealed the device existed in a top secret memo to @entity15 released today mr @entity19 wrote : ' we developed and deployed with very great urgency a naval laser weapon , designed to dazzle low flying @entity6 pilots attacking ships , to the @entity46 in the @entity47			1
this weapon was not used in action and knowledge of it has been kept to a very restricted level			0
' his briefing on military capabilities also touches on the laser weapon research and development programmes called @entity57 and @entity58 which were ' proceeding at high priority , ' according to the papers			0
he claims the @entity34 could field laser weapons by the mid- 1980s but it was uncertain whether owning such offensive laser weapons was useful			2
by the end of 1979 @entity1 interests were in using medium power laser directed against relatively softer targets such as eyes , optic and electro - optic sensors			2
his note said : ' the @entity72 could be in a position to field such weapons by the mid- 1980s ( in fact , the @entity72 may already have deployed a laser weapon on the cruiser @entity78 ) '			0
@entity1 researchers concentrated on countermeasures			0
programmes that were under way included @entity83 , which aimed to think up every possible way of protecting sensors			0
there was also the development programme known as @entity58 which sought to capitalise on any practical solutions arising out of the @entity83 work			0
meanwhile new documents reveal that when @entity15 visited the @entity3 to mark the 150th anniversary of the establishment of a permanent @entity1 settlement , it took six months to plan and cost £ 209,867			1
our hero : a rousing welcome from the @entity99 ' @entity98 ' for prime minister @entity15 , but her trip to the @entity3 was top secret and only revealed when she arrived amid fears the enemy could attack again victory : @entity15 and @entity105 met soldiers and civil leaders on a trip that cost £ 209,000 @entity109 flew with the @entity110 to @entity111 and then by @entity112 to @entity113 for the four - day trip			1
there was intense secrecy surrounding her visit as they feared the @entity6 might still be a threat , as it came eight months after the war ended			1
the press were told @entity15 was off to @entity122 for the weekend , but instead she and @entity105 went to @entity123 to start the journey			0
her trip was only announced when she arrived			0
duty clerk @entity126 wrote in a top secret note the importance ' of maintaining total secrecy of the visit			1
' the very fact that it was friday night lended itself readily to the pretence that the prime minister and mr @entity15 would be going to @entity122 and , therefore , it would be normal for their luggage to be in the front hall , albeit slightly more than normal '			0
the notes also reveal more mundane details about the trip , where the prime minister decided not to take ' a good @entity142 ' for civil and military leaders on the island and that she would lay a wreath of synthetic poppies because real ones would not survive the long trip from @entity1 .			2

device was sent to @entity3 as secret weapon to stop the enemy
its existence was hidden and only revealed to @entity15 in 1983
@entity19 briefed her on @entity34 laser and admitted @entity1 had one
new documents reveal @entity15 's *post-war* @entity3 visit cost £ 209,000
it took six months to plan and was top secret in case @entity6 attacked
