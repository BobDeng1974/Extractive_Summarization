' we 've done as much as we can			0
' the family has had to cover the costs of flying to and from @entity12 , accommodation and living costs , legal fees , and expert witnesses			0
but the hope of clearing his son 's name makes it all worth it , mr @entity2 said			2
' i 've got to back him all the way			0
he 's not guilty , i know in my heart he 's not guilty			0
' all the people who are here know he 's not guilty			0
