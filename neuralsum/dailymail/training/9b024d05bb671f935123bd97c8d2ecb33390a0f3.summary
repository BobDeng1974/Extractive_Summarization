by @entity0 published : 17:30 est , 2 january 2014 updated : 04:18 est , 3 january 2014 @entity1 , whose captaincy during @entity4 ’s surrender of the @entity5 has attracted considerable criticism , has had a lot on his mind on and off the pitch			2
as well as @entity4 facing a series whitewash in @entity11 , @entity1 is also expecting his first child with wife @entity13 and trying to buy a house , both of which can be stressful distractions			1
while in @entity18 , @entity1 is understood to have been negotiating to buy a farm for around £ 1.2million			1
feeling the strain : @entity1 has had a stressful @entity5 tour both on and off the field the residential 52 - acre farm with extensive equestrian facilities , including 10 stables , is situated near @entity27 ’s family farm in @entity28 , where @entity1 loves to spend time helping with the lambing and having a beer with the locals to escape from the pressures of test cricket			1
there is planning permission in place for @entity1 to knock down the farm buildings , allowing for the construction of a country mansion with panoramic views over open rolling countryside			0
@entity43 being given a second match as wicketkeeper was confirmed by captain @entity1 the day before the @entity34			0
yet @entity18 skipper @entity46 , who declined to list the @entity4 side in advance as he did earlier in the series , did keep up the mind games by suggesting , at two pre-test press conferences , that he believes axed wicketkeeper @entity52 was especially missed by @entity4 in @entity53 and should have been back in the side for @entity11			1
dropped : vice-captain @entity52 had been a mainstay of the @entity4 side since 2009 @entity55 , @entity57 chairman and deputy chairman of the @entity59 , and his family have more reason than most on the @entity4 tour in @entity18 for wanting to put 2013 behind them			1
three masked men , armed with a sledge - hammer , sword and handgun , smashed their way into the supermarket tycoon ’s country home and stole £ 220,000 worth of jewellery			0
@entity55 , who founded the @entity74 chain , was away on @entity57 ’s pre-season tour of @entity76 last march when the raid took place			2
his wife @entity79 was forced at gunpoint to lie on the landing while the gang opened the safe			0
year to forget : @entity57 chairman @entity55 ' house was targeted by armed robbers she was described as ‘ a woman of commendable steel ’ at @entity89 where the four robbers , including a getaway driver , were recently given jail sentences of between four and 10 years			1
@entity55 , in @entity11 with his wife and daughter @entity93 , who was also threatened during the armed robbery , said : ‘ we were always coming to @entity18 as we did for the series three years ago			2
but it ’s a chance to let us move on from a difficult time			0
’ relationships between the two warring @entity5 teams at @entity104 prime minister @entity103 ’s reception improved to the extent that a wife of one of the @entity59 directors even queued up to have her picture taken with @entity104 destroyer - in - chief @entity110			0
however , the @entity59 remain furious with the way their counterparts cricket @entity18 continue to use social media in an aggressive manner — and the subject will be raised after the fifth test			2
mr @entity119 : @entity18 fast bowler @entity110 is odds - on to win man of the series @entity124 ’ charm offensive @entity126 , who hijacked attention from the ashes with his ludicrous @entity130 nets encounter with @entity131 that resulted in a broken rib , continues on his self - publicity cricket tour @entity135 by tweeting about his first meeting with the equally obnoxious @entity137 : “ hi , mr @entity137 , i ’m @entity126 ” , i said			1
“ nah mate , you ’re a d * * * * * * * , ' he replied			0
’ but when it comes to d * * * * * * * s , @entity137 wins by a short head			0
publicity stunt : @entity126 raises his bat to the @entity130 crowd after facing an over from @entity131 ( second right ) @entity147 , who want former @entity4 captains to dominate their tv cricket commentary booth , already have a ready - made successor to current lead presenter @entity152 on their team in @entity154 , who will host the @entity156 internationals			1
@entity154 has managed to remain liked by the players while still asking them searching questions			0
however , @entity154 has 112 fewer @entity4 caps than @entity152 , which will likely count against him when the presenter role becomes available			0
in contention : @entity154 ( left ) could replace @entity152 as @entity147 's lead presenter			1

@entity1 negotiating to buy @entity28 farm for £ 1.2m
@entity46 continues mind games by *talking* up @entity52
@entity57 chairman @entity55 in @entity11 after tough year at home
@entity59 furious with @entity171 for aggressive *twitter* campaign
@entity126 's charm offensive shows no sign of abating
@entity154 in contention to succeed @entity152 at @entity147
