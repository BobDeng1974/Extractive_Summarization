life sentence : @entity1 , 70 , has vowed to continue to fight against his conviction for the horrific stabbing deaths of his pregnant wife and two daughters the case of the @entity8 doctor who has maintained for decades that not him but a band of hippies chanting ' acid is groovy , kill the pigs ' slaughtered his wife and two young daughters will continue in court			1
@entity1 , 70 , is serving a life sentence for the murders of his pregnant wife and two daughters , who were killed february 17 , 1970 , in the family apartment at @entity21			1
despite the latest judicial rejection of his claims of innocence and a request for a new trial , his attorney @entity22 said friday , ' there 's going to be further litigation			2
' @entity1 - who was convicted in 1979 , released in 1980 and returned to prison in 1982 - has maintained his innocence for the last 44 years			2
in a decision based on a hearing held almost two years ago , judge @entity32 rejected both @entity1 's claim of innocence and his appeal			1
' ... the court finds that @entity1 has not established , by clear and convincing evidence , that no reasonable factfinder would have found him guilty of the murder of his wife and two daughters ... ' @entity32 wrote , adding that @entity1 ' failed to establish any assumed actual innocence claim			2
' at that hearing , @entity1 's attorneys emphasized that @entity45 , who testified at @entity1 's trial , was n't involved in the murders and that she did n't know where she was when @entity49 , five - year - old @entity50 and two - year - old @entity51 were killed			1
her attorney , @entity52 , testified at the 2012 hearing that @entity45 , who died in 1983 , told him two versions of events : that she was n't in the apartment and that she was , but that she did n't participate in the murders			0
life sentence : a handcuffed dr. @entity1 is led away from @entity59 in @entity60 on wednesday , august 28 , 1979 after a jury found him guilty of one count of first degree murder and the two count of of second degree murder former family man : this 1969 photo shows @entity1 and his wife @entity68 in @entity21 , @entity69			1
a year later , a pregnant @entity68 and her two daughters were brutally slain ' we 're obviously disappointed that judge @entity32 denied our requests for relief because we thought we had presented credible evidence that the ( trial ) jury had not heard , particularly from @entity45 , which we thought would have made a difference , given the circumstantial evidence the prosecutor presented at that trial , ' @entity22 said			0
@entity84 attorney @entity83 said in a news release that @entity1 will have to seek permission from the 4th @entity84 @entity87 to appeal @entity32 's ruling			2
@entity1 's attorneys also argued that new evidence , including dna from the apartment that did n't match @entity1 or his family , supported @entity1 's claims			1
they also called witnesses to testify about statements by a retired @entity84 marshal , who is now dead , that a prosecutor pressured @entity45 to lie on the stand			0
the man most likely : @entity1 ( left ) resumed dating high school sweetheart @entity68 and they were married in 1963 before the birth of their first child @entity50 moving on : the incarcerated former @entity105 doctor ( pictured in 1995 ) remarried in 2002 but remains behind bars the statements by the marshal likely ' are fabrications or confused memories , ' @entity32 wrote , which made all of them ' incredible and unreliable			0
' the dna evidence ' is far from clear and convincing of @entity1 's actual innocence , ' the judge wrote			1
@entity115 , @entity49 's brother , said friday that he takes ' absolute and total satisfaction ' in @entity118 's decision			0
he said he was n't surprised that @entity1 plans to keep pursuing the case			0
' i know it will never be over until he is dead or i am dead , ' @entity115 said			0
the @entity1 family murders brought chills to the community , coming just months after the murders by the @entity127 followers in @entity128 , where ' pig ' was written in blood on the door of the home where actress @entity133 and four others were killed			1
and like the @entity127 murders , the @entity1 killings led to books , the most famous of which was ' @entity139			1
' written by author @entity140 , the book - and the television miniseries based on it - concluded @entity1 was guilty			0
just before the 2012 hearing for @entity1 , documentary filmmaker @entity146 ' book , ' a wilderness of error , ' was published			0
@entity146 concluded that @entity1 did not get a fair trial and might not be guilty .			0
