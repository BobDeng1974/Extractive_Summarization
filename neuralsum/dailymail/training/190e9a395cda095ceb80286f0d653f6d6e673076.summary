by @entity0 published : 11:01 est , 17 april 2012 updated : 11:35 est , 17 april 2012 researchers found a big increase in anger and fear head of last summer 's riots @entity8 scientists are using @entity9 to gauge the nation ’s mood , it has been revealed			1
researchers at @entity13 studied nearly 500 million tweets by ten million users of the social network between the summer of 2009 and early 2012 , a period marked by economic downturn and social tension			2
they found a big increase in negative mood , anger and fear , coinciding with the announcement of spending cuts and last summer ’s riots together with a calming effect of prince @entity27 ’s wedding to @entity28			1
in the study the researchers focused on measuring the mood , and changes , using standard tools for mood detection , of a large sample of the @entity8 population			2
a collection of 484 million tweets generated by more than 9.8 million users from the @entity8 were analysed between july 2009 and january 2012			0
the findings reveal intriguing patterns that can be explained when events and social changes are taken into account			0
the researchers found that a significant increase in negative mood indicators coincided with the announcement of the cuts to public spending by the government , and that this effect is still lasting			1
they also detected events such as the riots of summer 2011 , as well as a possible calming effect in the run up to the @entity56			1
a rise in public anger seems to have already been under way in the days before the riots			1
researchers at @entity13 found prince @entity27 's wedding to @entity28 had a calming effect according to tweets study co-author @entity64 , professor of artificial intelligence at @entity13 , said : ' social media allows for the easy gathering of large amounts of data generated by the public while communicating with each other			1
' while we leave the interpretation of our findings to social and political scientists , we observed how the period preceding the royal wedding seems to be marked by a lowered incidence of anger and fear , which starts rising soon after that			1
of course , other events also happened in early may 2011 , so they may also be responsible for that increase			2
' the aim of the study was to see if the effects of social events could be seen in the contents of @entity9			0
a collection of 484 million tweets generated by more than 9.8 million users from the @entity8 were analysed between july 2009 and january 2012 the first part of the analysis backs up the researchers ’ theory that word - counting methods can provide a reasonable approach to sentiment or mood analysis			0
by making use of lists of words that are correlated with the sentiments of joy , fear , anger and sadness , they observed that periodic events such as @entity110 , @entity111 and @entity112 evoke the same response in the population , year after year			2
the main part of the analysis focused on a visible change - point occurring in october 2010 , when the government announced cuts to public spending			0
the study showed that public mood has still not recovered from that announcement			0
the same testing technique shows another important period , that of summer 2011 , when riots broke out in various @entity8 cities , leading to looting and even loss of life			0
the researchers method seems to suggest that some increase in public anger preceded , and not followed , these events , although the significance of this finding is a matter for social scientists to discuss			1
future work will include the comparison with social media content with traditional media content , as well as the comparison of both with traditional opinion polls methods			0
the study was presented to an international workshop on social media applications in news and entertainment in @entity150 , @entity151 .			0
