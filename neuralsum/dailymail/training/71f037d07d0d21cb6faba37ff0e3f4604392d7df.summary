a @entity1 man who entered his new flat for the first time , walked in to find the previous tenant murdered in the bathroom			1
@entity6 , 45 , found the dead body of alleged drug dealer @entity8 , 50 , lying in a pool of blood and the flat ransacked and ' smashed up with a sledge hammer '			1
mr @entity6 had met up with mr @entity8 just one day earlier to pick up the keys for his new apartment in @entity15 in south central @entity1			1
mr @entity6 says the flat had been put on the market after mr @entity8 had stopped paying the rent , so the owner had decided to sell it			0
he had then purchased it from a online advert without even visiting it , telling police that the price was so cheap he had wanted to act quickly to make sure he grabbed a bargain			1
he said : ' it was terrifying when i saw the body , like the stuff from a horror movie			0
' the place looked like someone had smashed it up with a sledge hammer and then done the same to the previous tenant			1
' his head looked like it had been severely battered and i did n't even recognise if the body was that of a man or woman at first			1
' i immediately called the police and then vomited in the kitchen sink			2
' when police arrived they sealed off the apartment and began questioning neighbours			2
\ n \ n a police spokesman said : ' there are signs that the victim had been tortured before being murdered			2
' he is known to us as a drug dealer and we suspect this was some sort of revenge attack connected to his business			2
' so far the neighbours say they did n't hear anything			0
' now mr @entity6 says he has no intention of moving in and wants to sell the place			0
he said : ' there 's no way i 'm going to ever feel comfortable living here knowing what happened			0
