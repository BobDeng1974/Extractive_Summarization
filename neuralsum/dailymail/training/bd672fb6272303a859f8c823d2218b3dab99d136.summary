by @entity0 it has taken 30 years of diligent collecting for @entity3 to amass 15,000 @entity5 shirts – the world ’s largest collection			1
mr @entity3 , the owner of @entity9 's antiques and @entity10 in @entity11 , says that he loves @entity5 shirts , not only because they are a worthwhile investment , but also because they are a cool alternative to formal menswear			1
‘ i never understood suits			0
i do n’t even own a tie			0
they ’re creepy , actually , if you think about it			0
they turn people into little robot ants , ’ the 69 - year - old told @entity19 ’s blog in an interview			1
biggest collector : @entity3 ( pictured second from right ) owns the world 's largest hawaiian shirt collection , which he sells out of his store in @entity11 ‘ when you wear a @entity5 shirt it allows you to express yourself , ’ he added of the style , which has recently been reinterpreted by high fashion labels like @entity34 and @entity35			1
mr @entity9 ’s interest in prized vintage ‘ aloha shirts ’ as he calls them , started off as an accident – quite literally			0
he survived a 1,000 - foot fall from a building – after which point he sold the jewelry store he had been managing in @entity47 to start collecting the shirts because they were both cheap and festive			0
once he amassed a collection of 1,000 he transported the shirts to @entity51 in 1980 and opened a store , which would later move to @entity11			2
massive inventory : mr @entity3 's many shirts are priced up to $ 25,000 as many original @entity5 shirts were hand painted and one - of - a - kind worthy investment : mr @entity3 says that the value of his shirts have only soared as he has owned them - making them a much more worthy investment than stocks its fans include @entity67 , @entity68 , and @entity69 – the latter of which bought $ 20,000 worth of shirts from the store and has worn many of them on stage			2
mr @entity3 's most expensive shirts cost up to $ 25,000 and he says that vintage @entity5 shirts are so expensive because many of them are wearable art. early styles from the @entity82 were hand painted and enlisted artisanal stitching techniques			2
prime location : mr @entity3 's store ( pictured ) is located near the water in @entity11 - the birthplace of the modern @entity5 shirt like snowflakes : as mr @entity3 's collection points out - no two @entity5 shirts are the same , and many include interesting details now , thanks to modern technology , many of these prints have been recreated on contemporary @entity5 shirts , rather than hiring artists to create new landscapes and floral motifs – making the mass - produced fare much cheaper			1
because of this , mr @entity3 says that the original aloha shirts ( those created prior to the @entity105 ) have a bigger financial return ‘ than the stocks i pick which all uniformly go down			0

@entity3 of @entity11 , @entity11 has spent the last 30 years collecting 15,000 @entity10 shirts
