key witness : tango the @entity1 sat in the box as his owner 's murder suspect threatened him with a bat a dog has given evidence in a @entity9 murder trial			1
tango , a nine - year - old @entity1 , was called to the witness stand to help determine who killed his owner			1
in a preliminary hearing , the suspect was ordered by the judge to threaten @entity10 with a bat , as jurors noted how the canine reacted			1
for comparison , a second dog of the same age and breed , @entity24 , was also called to the witness box in the @entity9 city of @entity28 to face the experiment			1
@entity30 , defending , blasted the ' unreasonable ' and ' dangerous ' proceedings			1
he told @entity32 : ' so if @entity10 lifted his right paw , moved his mouth or his tail , is he recognising my client or not ? ' i find it very troubling for the @entity9 legal system			0
' if a judge ignores the demands of reason and surrounds himself with experts who are unreasonable , the system becomes very dangerous			2
' but it is hardly the first time a dog has been called to the stand			2
in 2008 , a dog named @entity50 created legal history as the first canine to appear as a witness in a murder case			1
the animal 's 59 - year - old owner had been found hanging from the ceiling of her @entity59 flat			1
police believe it was suicide but her family say that it was murder			0
the dog was in the flat at the time of the death			0
during a preliminary hearing in the city , the pet was led into the witness box by a vet			2
a suspect in the case was presented to the dog , to see how it reacted			2
it is said to have ' barked furiously '			0
in 2012 , a court in @entity79 , @entity80 , took a similar approach by sending a subpoena to a @entity83 in a drugs case			0
not the first : in 2012 , a @entity86 @entity85 was served a subpoena in @entity79 , @entity80 the canine witnes was presented with suspects and drugs as vets responded to hit reaction and last month a vet was asked to analyse a @entity95 's physical reactions as it sat in the witness box faced with two murder suspects			1
dog behaviourist @entity99 has blasted the activity as ' illegitimate '			0
he wrote in @entity9 magazine @entity101 : ' this expertise plays on popular beliefs , but has no scientific foundation			0
' @entity105 [ animal behaviour study ] is real science , it is no joke			0

tango the @entity1 called to witness box in owner 's murder trial
suspect ordered to threaten nine - year - old dog with a bat , vets watched
@entity120 blasted ' unreasonable ' and ' dangerous ' proceedings in @entity122
first dog to testify in court was @entity50 in 2008 , many others have since
