a gardener was able to take more than £ 200,000 from the bank account of an 89 - year - old woman as a result of a ruling by the controversial @entity5			1
the handyman persuaded the confused and vulnerable woman to sign an agreement that he should control all her bank accounts , savings and property			1
the agreement – which was approved by the court even after social workers questioned the gardener ’s motives – allowed him to put more than £ 200,000 of her money into his own account			1
he was stopped only when he tried to take nearly £ 150,000 more of her savings , causing her insurance firm to raise the alarm and the police to investigate			1
a gardener was able to take more than £ 200,000 from the bank account of an 89 - year - old woman because of of a ruling by the controversial @entity5 astonishingly , although the court has now ruled the man can no longer manage the woman ’s affairs , it has ruled that his name should be kept secret			1
details of the case were disclosed in a @entity5 judgment under new legal rules demanding greater openness			1
but critics said the ruling wrongly protects the gardener and leaves other elderly and vulnerable people and their families without warning of his record			1
the extraordinary case will add to growing fears over the workings of the @entity5			1
last week a damning inquiry found thousands of vulnerable people were being deprived of their liberty by decisions made in the secretive court under the @entity55			1
the scathing report by a @entity58 committee said that the @entity55 was being ‘ wilfully used to oppress individuals and to force decisions upon them ’ and should be changed urgently			0
the @entity5 at @entity60 , @entity60 , north @entity61			1
one of the three courts where hearings take place the gardener , now 69 , was able to persuade the wealthy widow to give him a lasting power of attorney ( @entity68 ) after he began working at her home in @entity70 , @entity71 , in 2006			0
the woman , who had spent her career working for the @entity74 , has no children and only distant relatives			1
in august 2011 , she signed a will in which she promised to leave four - fifths of her estate to the gardener			2
two months later , she signed over to him the right to control her affairs through an @entity68			0
her signature was witnessed by her accountant , and two friends completed a form in which they said she understood what she was doing and was not being pressured into it , the @entity5 found			1
a recent enquiry said many elderly or vulnerable people are dumped in residential homes to make it easier to control them or simply to save money			2
picture posed by model however , social worker @entity96 told the @entity97 , which is part of the @entity5 and regulates @entity99 , that she had ‘ concerns about [ the gardener ’s ] conduct ’			1
she told the court that the woman had been found on a bus in a confused state and taken to hospital but that the gardener had turned up on the ward , declared there was nothing wrong with her and insisted that she be discharged into his care			2
despite this , the gardener was granted power of attorney			0
according to the judgment : ‘ as the power of attorney was for property and financial affairs , and because the @entity123 concerns were of a personal and welfare nature , the @entity117 felt that he was unable to intervene			0
’ six weeks after the gardener won power of attorney in february 2012 , the widow was moved into a residential care home in @entity127 with dementia			0
over the following months , a series of payments were made to the gardener from her assets			0
they included a banker ’s draft for £ 7,000 , cash withdrawals totalling £ 8,520 and a gift the gardener made to himself of £ 38,000			2
a further £ 8,340 went on his salary for house clearance , rubbish removal and gardening			2
he paid a £ 599 deposit for a @entity143 car for his wife , together with £ 55 - a - week car hire payments and petrol money of around £ 30 a week			1
in february last year , he sold the widow ’s house for £ 165,000 and moved the money into his own account			2
an investigation began only when the gardener asked @entity153 to pay him the proceeds of a £ 140,000 investment bond held by the widow			2
a manager at the insurance company immediately froze the money and the @entity97 started an investigation			2
after he discovered he was being investigated , the gardener changed the name on the account into which he had put the money , putting it into the woman ’s name			2
investigators for the @entity117 found the woman did not even know who her gardener was and did not understand the powers she had given him			0
they also found he visited her care home only once every three weeks			0
at a court hearing , the gardener protested that if the @entity68 were to be struck out , he would not be able to afford the @entity143 car and would no longer be able to take the woman to visit her husband ’s grave			0
but senior judge @entity178 ordered the @entity68 to be revoked			0
he said the gardener had broken its terms in several ways and his claim to a salary was ‘ inherently artificial ’			0
because there has been no criminal charge ‘ it does not imply that his behaviour has been impeccable ’ , he said			0
he ordered that the woman ’s affairs should be managed by a publicly - appointed official who will pay her care home fees from the proceeds of the sale of her home			1
although the gardener was investigated by police , the @entity195 decided not to prosecute			0
he will keep more than £ 60,000 of the money he took from the woman ’s accounts and estate			1
@entity203 mp @entity202 , who has campaigned against secrecy in the courts , said : ‘ this is not exactly naming and shaming			0
‘ it is clear that the secrecy here is acting to protect someone who has been trying to extort money from someone , and will do nothing to protect other elderly people in a similar situation			0
’ the @entity215 was introduced under the 2005 @entity55 , which set up the @entity5 – only now being opened to public scrutiny after a series of scandals			1
@entity99 were designed to allow someone to hand control over their lives to a trusted spouse , friend or professional			0
whoever is named has the right to dictate the medical treatment of a vulnerable person , and is given the right to control financial affairs even before a person is deemed legally unable to make decisions for themselves .			0

he persuaded the vulnerable woman to sign over her bank accounts
the agreement was approved by @entity5 - despite social workers ' doubts
her insurance firm raised alarm after he tried to take nearly £ 150,000 more
