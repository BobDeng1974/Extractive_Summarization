i do n't know what to do with myself			0
i know her name is @entity22 and what she looks like but i 'm trying to save it all for the plane			0
' mr @entity9 was undecided on how he would greet her and was debating whether to give her a hug , a kiss - or ' a high five ' and added ' i 'll see what comes naturally '			1
when they were finally introduced by a television crew they gave each other a hug			0
miss @entity32 , who had set up her own @entity70 campaign called ' take @entity32 ' said : ' i 'm nervous - my hands have just started to shake			2
i feel like a swan , quite calm on the front but underneath i 'm paddling away			0
' a television crew from @entity75 , which filmed the moment they first met , asked the pair a few ' @entity9 & mrs ' style questions before they boarded the plane			1
asked who would get the window seat @entity84 offered it up to mr @entity9 and whether they were thrill seekers or beach babes they agreed they were a bit of both			2
miss @entity32 also revealed that she ' sleeps in the middle of the bed ' and the worst habit mr @entity9 could have would be snoring , which he previously revealed he did			1
his new companion was then introduced to mr @entity9 's parents , who embraced her and their son			2

the two highest @entity8 bidders failed to pay up , so he decided to sell raffle tickets instead explaining his decision to sell - off part of his honeymoon to the highest bidder he said : ' i was gutted when she said she did n't want to get married but i realised i could n't mope forever and i did n't want what i 'd already paid to the holiday to go to waste			1
' besides , i think it will be good for me to get away			0
i 'm just looking for a new friend who fancies a holiday with someone fun			0
' he claims his girlfriend of two years , @entity12 , told him she had pre-wedding nerves and could not go through with their wedding due to take place on @entity50 this year			2
but when he tried to cancel their holiday the co-op said he would only be able to claim half the cost back so he decided to keep the holiday and advertise for a new companion to join him			2
with the help of his best friend @entity138 , he set up an @entity8 auction to find someone to travel with him			1
mr @entity9 , who described himself as a slim , 5 ' 9 , with dark hair who enjoys a good laugh , wrote on the advert : ' i 'm not boring , i 'm adventurous otherwise i would n't be doing something as ridiculous as this '			2

mr @entity9 said he wanted to save chatting for the plane the pair will stay two weeks at the honeymoon suite at the @entity156 in the @entity14 @entity32 had campaigned to win the ticket and was introduced to her holiday partner for the first time this morning			1
miss @entity32 compared herself to feeling like a swan - fine on the surface but paddling underneath although the couple had been engaged for a year and due to marry on @entity50 , mr @entity9 says he harbours no bitterness to his ex-fiancee			1
speaking after the split , he said : ' i 'm just really glad she told me before we went through with the vows on our big day - i suppose i 've got to respect her honesty			0
' but i 'm certainly not going to let the money or the opportunity pass me by			0
' when i found out at the travel agent i could only get half my money back i was looking at other deals and places i could go but i thought , " no , i wanted to go on this holiday "			0
' i called my best friend and he agreed so i headed straight to his house to make the ebay page			0
' everyone i know is taken and i 'd rather go and enjoy it with someone new that i 'd never otherwise get to meet			0
mr @entity9 admitted he could only get half his money back from the travel agent and decided he wanted to go on this holiday but would like some female company a friend help him set up an advert where he asked for an ' easy going down to earth ' woman , a @entity43 citizen with a passport and ' good looking would n't go amiss ' ' i 'm not looking for a relationship - this could be an opportunity for someone who has never had the chance to take a holiday like this before			1
' i 'm not looking for anything apart from a fun holiday			0
if the girl is sporty and wants to do some scuba diving with me that would be great too			0
' after being overwhelmed with the response , mr @entity9 pledged to donate any money over £ 1,050 to testicular cancer research , and so far the figure has reached £ 2,000			2
he added : ' people have said i 've got real balls to do this so i thought i might as well try and make some money for charity if i can to			0

she posted this message this morning after keeping her win a secret his ex-girlfriend @entity12 said : ' i just did n’t feel ready to get married and @entity9 was n’t my soulmate			2
obviously it ’s difficult for @entity9 , i ’m finding it hard too			2
' it ’s obviously not nice to finish with someone over @entity2 but i thought it was better that he knew now , sooner rather than later			0
