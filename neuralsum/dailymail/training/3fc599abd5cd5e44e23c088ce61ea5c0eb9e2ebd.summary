a global fight against @entity4 militants will likely take years to fully succeed , but nations are prepared to engage ' for as long as it takes ' to defeat the bloody insurgency , @entity1 secretary of state @entity0 said today			1
nearly a year after the @entity10 overran key cities in western @entity12 , diplomats from more than 60 counties and international organisations gathered in @entity13 to plot a way forward against what has since become one of the world 's worst terror threats			2
' we recognise the hard work that remains to be done , ' @entity0 told the gathering at @entity23 headquarters , which hosted what was , to date , the largest meeting of foreign ministers to discuss the @entity10			0
' our commitment will be measured most likely in years , but our efforts are already having a significant impact			0
we will engage in this campaign for as long as it takes to prevail '			0
his comments come as the @entity34 revealed @entity35 had join the fight against @entity4 , launching airstrikes against militants in eastern @entity12			1
@entity35 has joined the fight against @entity4 in recent days a @entity34 spokesman said @entity54 has targeted the terror group in recent days , but is not co-ordinating attacks with the @entity1 and the @entity57 and has not been invited to join the coalition			1
the mostly @entity60 insurgency now stretches across much of northern @entity12 and @entity61 , attracting thousands of foreign fighters from around the world , including @entity64			0
its elusive leadership is flush with financial support from illicit donations and black - market oil sales			0
@entity0 also met privately with @entity12 prime minister @entity70 , who asked for ' a lot of support to be able to crush @entity73 ' - the @entity75 acronym for the @entity10			0
' i think we 're the only country in the @entity79 who is really fighting @entity73 on the ground , ' @entity70 said			0
while at @entity23 , the @entity12 leader announced his country was submitting a formal request to the alliance to help improve its military capacities , @entity23 spokesperson @entity82 said			0
the request will have to be reviewed by representatives of @entity23 's 28 member nations , she said			0
' anything that @entity23 might do in support of @entity12 's defense - capacity building would need to be complementary to the considerable efforts already undertaken by the @entity1 - led coalition and individual @entity23 allies , ' @entity82 said			1
since august 8 - nearly two months after militants seized control of @entity98 , @entity12 's second - largest city - the @entity1 and allies have launched more than 1,000 airstrikes against the @entity10 in @entity12 and @entity61			1
attack : @entity104 police troopers gather at the damaged residence of the @entity35 ambassador in @entity107 , after a car bomb exploded on the street outside , killing three people possible retaliation : @entity35 ambassador @entity112 was not in the house when the attack took place @entity0 said the attacks have greatly hampered the insurgency and cited training missions and equipment being supplied by other nations that have joined the coalition since it was created less than three months ago			1
meanwhile , rear admiral @entity122 said the @entity1 believes this may be the first time @entity54 has launched manned aircraft from inside @entity35 to strike targets in @entity12			1
the fight against @entity4 has seen @entity54 and the @entity127 set aside their customary hostility to battle a common enemy which both governments view as a dangerous threat			2
earlier this week , an f - 4 fighter , similar to those used by the @entity35 air force , was filmed attacking targets in the eastern province of @entity52 , and its nationality was confirmed by @entity34 yesterday			2
' we have indications that they [ @entity35 ] did indeed fly air strikes with @entity144 in the past several days , ' @entity34 spokesman rear admiral @entity122 said			2
@entity35 forces have been active on the ground in @entity12 assisting @entity148 militia and @entity150 government units , but this was the first time the @entity1 had confirmed the @entity35 air force was conducting strikes against the @entity152			1
@entity122 said the @entity1 was not coordinating with @entity35 forces and that it was up to the @entity12 government to oversee military flights by different countries			1
suicide mission : witnesses say a suicide attacker drove a car laden with explosives at the residence of the @entity35 ambassador in the @entity104 capital @entity107 , but this has not been confirmed ' we are flying missions over @entity12			1
we co-ordinate with the @entity12 government as we conduct those			0
it 's up to the @entity12 government to deconflict that air space , ' @entity122 told reporters			0
' nothing has changed about our policy of not coordinating military activity with the @entity35			0
' shortly after @entity54 's airstrikes were confirmed , @entity35 's ambassador to @entity104 was targeted in a bomb attack in the capital of @entity107			1
a car bomb detonated outside the residence of ambassador @entity112 in @entity107 this morning , killing at least three people , security officials and witnesses said			0
the ambassador was not in the house when the attack took place , and it was not immediately clear whether the attack was in retaliation for @entity35 's airstrikes against @entity4			1
it is also not known if the attack was carried out by a suicide bomber or if the device was remotely detonated			0
@entity148 - ruled @entity35 has close ties to the @entity148 - led government in @entity150 , and @entity54 quickly came to the government 's aid after the @entity60 jihadists overran @entity12 army units in western and northern @entity12 earlier this year			2
@entity35 also has provided weapons to @entity148 fighters in @entity12 and several fighter jets , amid widespread speculation that the planes are flown by @entity35 pilots			2
joining forces : @entity35 has launched airstrikes against militants in eastern @entity12 alongside coalition forces ( pictured is two @entity213 @entity212 over @entity12 ) the commander of @entity35 's elite @entity215 , major general @entity216 , led a counter-attack in @entity12 over the summer that pushed back is militants from a key route leading from @entity221 to @entity150 , according to @entity223 's @entity148 movement @entity222			1
even if there is no direct communication between @entity35 and @entity1 forces , the @entity1 likely would be aware and easily monitor flights over @entity12 by @entity35 's less sophisticated air fleet , which uses a fighter jet that dates back to the @entity230 a @entity1 air command center in @entity232 coordinates @entity1 fighters , bombers , drones and surveillance aircraft flying round - the - clock missions over @entity12 along with other coalition warplanes from @entity64 governments as well as @entity240 and @entity241			1
the onslaught of the @entity152 in @entity12 has forged an unlikely alignment between @entity35 and the @entity1 , which have been locked in a cold war for more than three decades			1
the fight against the @entity152 has come amid a @entity1 diplomatic drive to agree a deal with @entity35 over its nuclear program , and officials acknowledge the two sides have discussed the war in @entity12 on the margins of the nuclear talks			2
but the two rivals remain deeply opposed over @entity61 , with @entity35 providing crucial military backing for president @entity256 while @entity127 has vowed to train a moderate rebel force to eventually confront the @entity259 regime			0
analysts and former @entity1 officials say neither country appears ready to pursue elaborate cooperation for military operations in @entity12 , but there appears to be some level of tactical communication at least to avoid accidents			2
as the two governments expand their military activity in @entity12 , there is a growing risk of potential crossed signals or conflict as @entity127 and @entity54 remain bitter enemies .			0
