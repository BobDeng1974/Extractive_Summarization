toxic water in @entity3 's lakes may contain bacteria linked to @entity5 's , scientists fear			1
huge increases in poisonous algae have been recorded in freshwater lakes since the 1880s			1
and scientists fear that colonies of the plant life could pose a threat to drinking water because they harbour toxins that can damage the liver and nervous system			1
the algae has even been linked to neuro - degenerative conditions such as @entity5 's , @entity20 's and motor neurone disease			1
poisonous algae ( pictured ) has been linked to neuro - degenerative conditions such as @entity5 's , @entity20 's and motor neurone disease			1
pictured is a buildup of the plant in the @entity25 , @entity26 the study , carried out by experts from the @entity29 and @entity30 in @entity31 , examined more than 100 lakes across @entity33 and @entity34 â€“ including waterways in the @entity36 , @entity38 meres , @entity40 lochs and @entity42 's upland lakes			2
their findings showed that in the past 200 years , 58 per cent of lakes had seen a significant boost in the concentrations of blue - green algae pigments			0
scientists fear the increase has been driven by pollution from industrial sites and sewers that pump nitrogen and phosphorus into the lakes , which the algae thrives on			2
the first signs of exposure to the harmful algae are skin rash or irritation , gastroenteritis and respiratory distress			0
exposure to low doses of the algae can result in liver tumours or hormone disruption			0
@entity70 from @entity30 said : ' we found that cyanobacterial populations have expanded really strongly in many lakes since the advent of industrial fertilisers and rapid urban growth			0
' while we already knew that cyanobacteria prefer warm and nutrient - rich conditions , our study is also the first to show that the effect of nutrients , such as phosphorus and nitrogen , overwhelm those of global warming			0
' there have been some 150 reported sightings of the algae in @entity3 's waterways in a year , and in 2013 it covered the lake in @entity93 opposite @entity92			2
algae blooms can cut off fish 's oxygen supply and dozens of dogs are put down every year for ingesting it .			0
