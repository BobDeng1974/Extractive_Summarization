calorie counts on nutrition labels and restaurant menus are often incorrect , new evidence suggests			1
currently the @entity5 system , developed by the @entity7 chemist @entity6 more than 100 years ago , is widely used to determine caloric values			1
but now experts are calling for a more accurate method to be introduced as @entity6 's calculations fail to take into account preparation and processing techniques which can affect the number of calories people consume			1
misleading : experts are calling for a more reliable way of calculating calories in food stuffs as the current method fails to take into account various factors such as as preparation and processing techniques @entity26 from @entity27 , who is due to give a presentation on the subject at a meeting held by the @entity31 this month , told @entity32 : ' by getting a better understating of the effective calories in food , we 'll get a better sense of human energy requirement			1
' ms @entity26 previously found that people get more calories from processed foods - pureed vegetables or fruit for example - than unprocessed goods			1
this is because it takes less energy to digest ingredients in liquid form than in their raw and natural state			1
explaining her findings she told @entity53 : ' the calorie values reported on food labels do not capture important costs of digestion that are typically lower for processed foods and higher for unmodified items			1
' so although two foods might have the same number of calories on paper , these calories are not necessarily equally available to the body			1
the table below reveals how foods measure up against the claim on the label			1
@entity70 blue cheese wedge side salad ' in some cases , reported calorie values could differ from actual energy harvest by as much as 50per cent			1
' she is now hoping to encourage efforts to quantify calories in a more accurate way			2
' given that the @entity5 system is treating essentially all foods the same , we are nâ€™t getting a good perspective when it comes to making dietary choices			2
' we can start to think of simple ways to improve [ the system ] that will be better for the average consumer , ' she added			2
in the late 19th century @entity6 conducted a series of experiments which involved burning samples of food and measuring the amount of energy released from the heat they produced			2
he concluded that proteins and carbohydrates have about 4 calories per gram , fats have 9 calories per gram , and alcohol has 7 calories per gram			2
therefore an energy bar that contains 10g of protein , 20g of carbohydrate and 9g of fat would have 201 calories			2
this simple formula is how many food manufacturers calculate the calories in foods			2
in the @entity114 , researchers introduced modified @entity5 values that were intended for specific foods , such as fruits , vegetables and beans , but since then there have been little changes			1
last year @entity122 , a research physiologist at the @entity123 in @entity124 , @entity125 , found that almonds have 32per cent fewer calories than previously estimated			0
according to the @entity5 system a 28 gram serving of almonds has about 170 calories , but mr @entity122 found the energy content of the nuts was around 129 calories			0
he explained : ' if we 're going to put the information out there on the food label , it would be nice that it 's accurate			0
' nutritionist @entity140 found that soups , salads and sides at restaurants were the worst offenders when it came to items that contained more calories than stated			0
' we are n't getting a good perspective when it comes to making dietary choices ' shockingly the @entity70 claimed their classic blue cheese wedge side salad had 376 calories , but lab results showed it had a gut - busting 1,035			0
and a separate study by the today show last summer found that so - called low - calorie ice creams and frozen yoghurts can contain as much as 68per cent more calories than the labels claim			0
ms @entity140 said : ' it 's really the low - calorie foods that matter more			0
if you 're buying a thousand calorie item , you 're probably not counting calories			0
if you 're buying a low - calorie diet item , you do n't want it to be off			0
' many calorie counts also do n't account for the fact that some calories in food are lost as heat			0
the amount of heat we expend depends on the components of the food			0
for proteins , it 's about 20 to 30per cent of the food 's calories - so 100 calories of protein would provide around 80 calories - while for fats it 's about 0 to 3per cent - meaning 100 calories worth of fat would equal 97 calories			0
while many researchers are pushing for improvements to be made to the @entity192 some say that on the whole , the inaccuracies do not make a big difference			1
@entity197 , professor of nutrition emeritus at @entity199 and co-author of the book @entity202 added : ' for most uses , i think they 're good enough			0

@entity27 researcher @entity26 is calling for the @entity192 , which is widely used to determine caloric values , to be *updated*
