@entity0 , pictured at a state dinner in 2010 with wife @entity85 , had hopes of a political comeback @entity0 is being investigated on suspicion he used his influence to secure leaked details of an inquiry into alleged irregularities in his victorious 2007 election campaign			1

@entity0 gets into a car to be taken to the offices of the judicial police in @entity105 , @entity19 where he is being held in police custody @entity0 was informed of the formal investigation during the early hours this morning by investigating magistrates after he had been held in police custody until nearly midnight on tuesday			1
he arrived at police offices in the @entity19 suburb of @entity105 just after 8am and was placed ‘ garde a vue ' , a legal term meaning he is a suspect in a criminal inquiry			1
@entity0 's detention over accusations of influence - peddling at @entity7 's highest court followed the arrest on monday of two magistrates and @entity0 's lawyer , @entity119			1
mr @entity0 arrived by car at the anti-corruption office in @entity19 this morning to be questioned by investigators into suspected ' influence - peddling ' the former leader is said to have offered one of the judges , @entity125 , a job in return for inside information on the so - called @entity131 affair			1

as president , he had enjoyed immunity from prosecution , but this came to an end with his defeat by socialist candidate @entity82			2
@entity0 , who has indicated he will run for re-election in 2017 , has always insisted that he is innocent of any wrongdoing			2
