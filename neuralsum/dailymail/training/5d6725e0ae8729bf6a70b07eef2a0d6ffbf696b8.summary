by @entity1 reporter published : 17:26 est , 17 august 2012 updated : 18:02 est , 17 august 2012 they are among motorists ' pet hates , with councils constantly under pressure to fix potholes as soon as they blight any road			0
but one local authority appear to have different priorities - after they ignored the two - inch deep hole and instead painted white speed camera lines straight over it			1
drivers in @entity16 , near @entity17 , @entity18 , have been left astonished after highways engineers refused to fill in the pothole and simply painted over it			1
safety first ? @entity23 opted to paint over this pothole near @entity17 rather than fill it in the speed camera next to a pothole is on the @entity28 near @entity16 on the way to @entity17 , @entity18 officials ignored the one foot - long dip in favour of painting small white stripes along the road in line with a speed camera placed a few metres away			1
the bizarre action has left furious villagers convinced that @entity23 are more interested in making money from speeding fines than making roads safe			1
@entity42 , parish councillor for nearby @entity43			0
said : ' you could n’t make this up			0
i ’m a taxpayer and i could n’t believe what they had done			0
' if they ’d had enough white paint they could have filled the whole thing up and made it level			0
the pothole is around two inches deep and has already caught out dozens of drivers on the way through @entity18 ' when the lorry turned up my immediate reaction was , at least they are fixing the pothole , but then they just repainted the lines , one of them actually in the pothole itself			1
' they obviously care about the money from the camera more than the safety of motorists and cyclists			1
' why are they not prioritising people ’s and motorists ’ safety rather than a speed camera ? ' the camera is in the pretty village of @entity16 on the @entity28 road which runs towards @entity17			1
the side of the road is littered with hubcaps that have come off when motorists have driven through the huge pothole too fast and numerous drivers have suffered split tyres			2
' the pothole is at least two inches deep and really dangerous if you do n’t know it ’s there , ' said resident @entity91			2
' it ’s ridiculous that they have painted the white lines before repairing the damaged road			2
' a spokesman for @entity23 said last night : ' @entity97 is currently renewing the lining at various safety camera sites across the county			2
' unfortunately , on this occasion the lining crew proceeded with the lining renewal as instructed , despite the appearance of this defect			0
the pot hole is due to be repaired within the next three days and any damaged markings will be repainted immediately afterwards			0
instructions have been issued to the crews to prevent this from happening again			0
