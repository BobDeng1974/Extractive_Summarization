separate lessons for boys aged 11 to 16 in state schools could stop them falling behind in exam results , according to the first male president of the @entity14 ’ @entity15			1
statistics have shown that boys often lag behind girls at both @entity19 and a-level and are much less likely to apply to university			2
@entity0 , who is also a schools inspector , said : ‘ if you have a very bright , very driven , very focused , very articulate lady , which a lot of girls are , that intimidates a boy in the classroom , especially boys of average ability			1
‘ the result is that boys do n’t put their hands up to answer questions or they indulge in immature behaviour to avoid being shown up			0
boys are falling behind as girls are doing better			2
’ mr @entity0 told the @entity39 : ‘ boys will put their hand up if they feel safe ; they wo n’t if they are in fear of being ridiculed or humiliated			1

’ the former choral scholar – who has been principal of @entity49 ’s girls ’ school in @entity50 , @entity51 , since 2001 – is calling for boys to be taught under the ‘ diamond model ’ to improve their academic results			0
the model sees boys and girls educated together until the age of 11 , before being taught separately until 16 and then returned to mixed classes in sixth form			1
‘ in the most formative years when adolescence is hitting with a vengeance , boys should be educated separately			1
‘ more single - sex classes for boys in state schools might halt the decline in boys ’ achievement , ’ mr @entity0 explained			1
‘ i think that every state school should consider introducing the diamond model and experiment with teaching boys and girls separately especially in subjects like @entity74 , maths and sciences			2

fears of a gender gap have been fuelled by @entity80 statistics released in october which showed 61.2 per cent of girls at state schools scored at least five c grades including @entity74 and maths last year , compared with 50.8 per cent of boys			2
but at @entity112 , boys did better than girls with 12.3 per cent of male students gaining three a * - a grades , compared with 11.1 per cent of female classmates			0
mr @entity0 ' comments come as its revealed a huge gender divide in the a-levels chosen by sixth - formers is likely to continue as girls continue to shun ' masculine ' subjects like physics , it is suggested			1
