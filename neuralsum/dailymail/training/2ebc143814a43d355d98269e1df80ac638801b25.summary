@entity1 's win against @entity2 on saturday was only their third by a 1 - 0 scoreline in the 49 @entity6 games played since sir @entity7 retired			1
it 's a result more readily associated with @entity10 's @entity9 than the all - singing cast at @entity11 but @entity12 wo n't care with a top - four finish his over-riding priority this season			1
in fact , the way @entity16 set up his team for a home game against struggling @entity2 encouraged a tight match in which @entity1 could maintain a possession stranglehold of the game and eventually prevail			1
videos scroll down to watch @entity24 shoots and scores to give @entity1 a 1 - 0 win against @entity2 at @entity11 @entity27 and @entity28 congratulate @entity24 as @entity1 won 1 - 0 for the third time in 49 matches @entity1 boss @entity12 , pictured with @entity31 and @entity32 , set up to maintain possession the 1 - 0 scoreline is synonymous with @entity10 's @entity9 side of the late eighties and early nineties having spent £ 158million over the summer , @entity12 had become worried by @entity1 's soft underbelly , and the ease in which his team had conceded five at @entity40 , four at @entity41 and failed to beat @entity42 or @entity43 in their last two games			1
this is how the @entity1 manager stopped playing fantasy football – and delivered a win			1
1 : the return of @entity50 having suffered ankle ligament damage in @entity16 's first week in the job , this was a first start of the season for the @entity56 man			0
he was asked to sit in front of the back four , give @entity1 controlled possession of the ball and be alert to any @entity2 counter-attacks			1
it did n't make for gung - ho excitement but @entity1 finished the game with 72 per cent possession and @entity24 took the one chance that counted			1
@entity50 , starting his first game of the season , challenges @entity2 striker @entity71 2 : @entity27 , midfielder on paper , the @entity1 formation looked as if it would pan out as a 4 - 4 - 2 with @entity28 and @entity27 up front			1
in reality it was 4 - 1 - 4 - 1 with @entity50 sitting and @entity27 playing alongside @entity78 in central midfield			1
for a home game against @entity2 , @entity80 would undoubtedly have been criticised for negativity if he 'd used a similar system			2
but with @entity1 having started the weekend a lowly 10th , @entity16 simply decided on a zero - risk policy , particularly with four centre halves unavailable through injury and suspension			1
@entity27 was n't a stand - out performer but he was disciplined , kept the ball moving and did venture forward at the right times , firing two shots wide			0
@entity27 , playing in central midfield , gave a disciplined performance and kept the ball moving against @entity2 3 : no more famous five the hype had us believe that @entity100 - @entity99 were going to be @entity1 's answer to @entity103 's attacking quintet of @entity105 - @entity104			1
their attitude was that no matter how many the opposition would score , they would score more			0
@entity16 has clearly decided such a line - up and approach is unworkable in reality			0
only @entity100 and @entity27 stayed on the pitch for 90 minutes on saturday , and @entity27 spent it in midfield rather than attack			0
@entity24 started on the bench and soon after he came on , @entity99 made way to keep the balance right and help preserve @entity1 's slender lead			1
@entity119 has n't played for a couple of weeks because of a training ground injury that has n't been fully explained , and even when he returns there is no guarantee he 'll be ahead of teenager @entity124 in the pecking order			0
striker @entity100 played 90 minutes but @entity16 has since decided against playing all his star men together 4 : @entity127 sacrificed for the team soon after he 'd completed his record £ 60million move to @entity1 , @entity99 was the star of the show for @entity132 against @entity133 in a rematch of the @entity136 final , his heat map showing he appeared all over the field to score and set up goals			2
but his thrilling brand of football is also risky when attacking moves break down and @entity1 had been wounded in previous games , the problem compounded by having to make so many changes in defence			2
so on saturday , @entity16 asked @entity99 to stay wide on the left and not to desert his post ; no wandering , no dragging the team out of position			0
for the @entity153 , it was difficult ; @entity2 defended so deep and often doubled up on him , so there was no space			2
he was replaced with 20 minutes to go , soon after supplying the assist for @entity24 's strike			2
@entity16 was sympathetic and his estimation of @entity99 has probably gone up after his selfless efforts			0
not every superstar sacrifices his skills for the team cause at a cost to their own performance			0
@entity168 had a difficult afternoon after the @entity153 was forced to sacrifice his skills and stay on the left 5 : balance at the back ironically , @entity16 's predecessor @entity80 was a huge fan of having one right - footed centre back play alongside one left - footed centre back			0
at @entity175 , he insisted on it as an unbreakable rule – no matter which individuals might be left out as a result			0
@entity16 took a leaf out of @entity80 ' book and brought in midfielder @entity181 to replace the injured @entity182 , mainly because he is a natural left - footer			0
teenager @entity184 and @entity181 therefore had the right - left combination at the heart of @entity1 's defence and though they gave up one chance to @entity190 by leaving a cross to each other , their overall partnership was good given their clear inexperience of the @entity6 – just nine previous starts between them .			2

@entity1 beat @entity2 1 - 0 at @entity11 on saturday
manager @entity12 set up his side to maintain a possession
@entity24 scored the winning goal as the @entity201 moved up to sixth
