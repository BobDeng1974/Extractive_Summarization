doctors trained in some of the world ’s poorest countries where medical qualifications are far less rigorous than in the @entity4 are being recruited by the @entity5			1
while some of @entity4 ’s brightest students are unable to get on medical courses at home , the @entity6 is hiring a third of its doctors from abroad			1
among them are medics from 143 different nations including poverty - stricken states such as @entity16 , @entity17 and the @entity18			1
some have studied in countries whose universities have few computers or medical textbooks and trainees are taught from blackboards in cramped classrooms where they are forced to sit on the floor			2
critics said it was ‘ bonkers ’ that @entity4 straight - a students desperate to become doctors were being turned away from medical courses due to government quotas while the @entity5 recruited staff from remote parts of the world with poor medical training			1
the revelation comes amid fears the health service is becoming too dependent on foreign @entity43 senior doctor recently warned that many of them had ‘ little or no knowledge and experience of @entity4 culture or of our @entity6 ’			1
professor @entity49 , a senior cancer specialist who works at the @entity50 in @entity51 , wrote in the @entity53 magazine : ‘ importing doctors from abroad on a regular and ongoing basis might not be a bad thing if there were any guarantee that the entry criteria to all foreign medical schools were as rigorous and as discriminating as our own			1
‘ also , that the quality of teaching and training was always as comprehensive as ours			0
but too often , it is n’t			0
’ foreign doctors are four times more likely to be struck off or suspended than those who trained in this country , while a quarter of all doctors barred from the register qualified abroad – the highest number were from @entity74			1
those who trained outside the @entity75 have to sit an exam on basic medical competence and score 7 out of 7 on an @entity79 language test before being allowed on the register			1
doctors who have trained outside the @entity75 are required to pass a language test before they practice in the @entity4 they must also have gained their medical qualifications in a university ‘ approved ’ by the @entity84			1
but the watchdog has only blacklisted eight institutions from the thousands around the world including one in @entity16 , one in the @entity88 in the @entity89 , and one in @entity17			0
doctors who qualify within the @entity75 are exempt from such checks due to strict ‘ freedom of movement ’ rules and they are allowed on the register automatically			1
there is widespread concern that @entity99 doctors are being allowed to work in @entity4 even if they can barely speak @entity79 or have rusty medical skills			2
the flaw was tragically exposed in 2008 when a @entity103 gp , dr @entity104 , killed pensioner @entity105 by giving him a huge dose of morphine on his first shift as an out - of - hours gp			2
@entity109 , of @entity110 , said : ‘ one of the main complaints we hear from patients is the language problems			2
‘ often these doctors speak better @entity79 than patients but they can not understand regional dialects and due to their intonation , patients can not understand them			2
‘ there are also problems with doctors getting to grips with all the @entity5 ’s policy and guidelines			0
‘ they are thrown in at the deep end , and they just do n’t know what they are doing			0
’ the government plans to appoint senior consultants and @entity132 to supervise @entity75 doctors and ensure they are up to scratch – on the language and medical skills			1
the system is due to come into force next year but doctors say they will not have time to carry out the checks and warn that locums – who do not have a permanent workplace – will slip through the net			0
@entity145 , of the think - tank 2020 health , said the health service needed to ‘ tighten up considerably ’ on foreign medics			0
she added : ‘ where you ’ve got night locums , it ’s very difficult to get them up to speed and often they are employed when there are less senior staff around			0
’ @entity84 figures show that there were 252,553 doctors who trained oversees on the register last year , a rise of 3 per cent from 2011			2
@entity74 provides the most doctors , with 25,336 , while 8,998 are from @entity161 , 5,695 from @entity162 , 4,010 from @entity163 and 3,936 from @entity164 – where medical training has been heavily criticised			2
another 727 are from @entity166 – where there are few computers and students learn from blackboards – 383 from @entity171 and 123 from @entity172			0
the @entity84 has only blocked eight institutions from supplying doctors to the @entity4			0
foreign doctors are four times more likely to be struck off or suspended than those with @entity4 training some experts pointed out that the @entity5 depends on overseas doctors particularly in unpopular specialisms such as @entity182 and care of the elderly which struggle to recruit staff			0
a spokesman for the @entity188 said : ‘ overseas doctors have for many years made a valuable and important contribution to the @entity5 , especially in key services where there has been a historic shortage of @entity4 - trained doctors			1
‘ this includes consultant posts in emergency care , haematology [ blood disorders ] and old age psychiatry			0
without the support of these doctors many @entity5 services would struggle to provide effective care to their patients			0

@entity6 is hiring one third of its doctors from 143 different nations
government quotas mean straight - a students are being turned away from medical degrees
those who trained outside @entity75 have to pass language test and medical exam
