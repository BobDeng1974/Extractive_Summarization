the paedophile brother of @entity2 president @entity1 was told he had committed the greatest breach of trust imaginable as he was jailed for 16 years for raping his daughter			1
@entity6 , 58 , from west @entity7 , showed no visible sign of remorse as a judge passed sentence in @entity12 , shaking his head occasionally during the hearing and then smiling and laughing as he was led from the dock			1
as his crimes were committed at a time when offenders in @entity19 were still eligible for 50 per cent remission on jail terms - a policy that has since been reformed - @entity1 is set to be released after spending eight years behind bars			1
@entity6 ( left ) , the brother of @entity2 president @entity1 ( right ) , arrives at @entity12			1
he has been jailed for child sex abuse the former youth worker was found guilty last month of a string of vile sexual assaults on his child @entity28 when she was aged between four and nine in the late 1970s and early 1980s			1
the 40 - year - old , who has waived her right to anonymity , wiped tears from her eyes as she watched on from the public gallery of court 14 as her father found out the length of the jail term awaiting him			2
handing down the sentence , which comprised 16 years in custody and a further two years on probation , judge @entity41 said @entity1 's continued refusal to admit his guilt was still denying his daughter the closure she sought			1
' it has been clear throughout that mrs @entity28 simply wanted an acknowledgement from her father that what he had done to her during her childhood was wrong , ' she said			0
' he has always denied her this acknowledgement and continues to do so			0
' however she now at least knows that the jury must have found her evidence compelling as they believed her			0
' the judge added : ' this case involved the greatest breach of trust imaginable where a father instead of caring for and protecting his daughter himself abused her			0
' during the trial ms @entity28 gave graphic details of the abuse , which started when she was aged four @entity6 , from @entity66 , was found guilty of 10 offences against his daughter - three counts of rape , four of indecent assault and three of gross indecency			1
the abuse was committed over a five - year period between 1977 and 1981			2
bespectacled @entity1 , dressed in brown jacket , jeans and blue checked shirt , supported himself with a walking stick as he stood to hear his sentence			1
his convictions have heaped pressure on his high - profile older brother to explain why he did not alert the authorities to the abuse allegations when he first learned of them			1
during a first trial earlier this year , which collapsed , the @entity2 leader , now a public representative in the @entity90 , claimed he first heard of the sex abuse claims in 1987 and , 13 years later , his younger brother admitted his guilt to him while the pair were walking in the rain			1
the former west @entity97 faced criticism for not informing police about the alleged confession for another nine years			1
leaving court : @entity28 ( third right ) , daughter of @entity6 , is supported by family and friends after the trial ended in october @entity107 ( @entity107 ) officers recommended the @entity108 ( @entity108 ) take no case against the @entity2 veteran			1
@entity19 's police ombudsman is now investigating if detectives properly examined whether @entity1 covered up the crimes and the @entity107 has pledged to review the case			1
@entity19 's attorney general @entity115 is examining the role of prosecutors			0
@entity1 , who was not in court today , instead attending the funeral of well known priest @entity120 in west @entity7 , has insisted he committed no offence and accused political rivals of exploiting a family issue to attack him			2
ahead of passing sentence , judge @entity41 outlined details of his brother 's crimes			2
three of the convictions relate to an incident in may 1978 when he raped and further sexually abused his daughter when her mother was in hospital giving birth to her younger brother			2
the judge said @entity1 would warn his daughter that if she told on him he would be sent to jail			2
' mrs @entity28 told the court in the evidence that even as a young child she had an understanding that what was happening was wrong but that she did not understand why her father was doing it to her , ' she said			0
ms @entity41 said he committed the abuse when he was angry , sometimes drunk and sometimes sober			0
' she remembers the smell of his breath when he had taken drink and he was pressing down on her chest , ' the judge told the court			0
mrs @entity28 first brought the matter to police in 1987			2
this was in the midst of the @entity157 and a time when many people in republican communities distrusted and refused to co-operate with the security forces			0
she did not pursue the matter at that stage , claiming that detectives were more interested to hear information about her famous uncle than about the allegations she was levelling against her father			0
it would not be for another 20 years before she went to police again , after finding out that her father was working in a west @entity7 youth club that her children attended			2
as well as spending two years on probation at the end of his prison sentence , @entity1 will be placed on the sex offenders register indefinitely and will be barred from working with children			1
among the aggravating factors the judge took into account when passing sentence were the age of the victim , the horrific nature of the crimes , and the continuing impact on mrs @entity28			0
she said the victim had described how the abuse impacted on her education , affecting her concentration and motivation in the classroom , while in later life she has found herself being overprotective when it came to her own children			0
ms @entity41 said the trial had also taken its toll on mrs @entity28 and recalled how her evidence had to be delayed at one stage after she developed chest pains			0
another aggravating factor was the major breach of trust committed , the judge said			0
ms @entity41 added : ' the evidence has established in the view of this court that he used this child for his own sexual gratification , whenever he had the opportunity when her mother was not present in the house			0
' she said the only mitigating factors were his poor health - he suffers from both inflammation of the arteries ( temporal arteritis ) and osteoarthritis , a lack of significant previous criminal record , and the fact that no evidence of further sexual offending since 1981 had emerged			0
mrs @entity28 did not make a public comment on the sentence as she left the court			0
