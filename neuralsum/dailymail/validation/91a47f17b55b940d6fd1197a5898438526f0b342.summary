a mother has described how her teenage son woke from a coma addicted to cheese and compulsively swearing			1
@entity4 , 15 , suffered a sudden , potentially life - threatening brain bleed in june last year			1
he had surgery to relieve pressure on his brain and doctors at @entity10 put him in a coma for nine days so he could recover			1
when he woke up he was unable to move or speak , a result of the trauma his brain had endured			1
while he has since regained the ability to walk and talk again , @entity4 has been left with some unusual side - effects			1
he has become so addicted to cheese that he munches on several blocks of it a day - and even puts it on his cereal			1
and previously well - mannered , he now regularly swears , to his mother 's horror			0
@entity4 , 15 , suffered a sudden , potentially life - threatening brain bleed in june last year			1
since then , he has become ' addicted ' to cheese and swears profusely his mother @entity26 , of @entity27 , said : ' he 's addicted to cheese â€“ and he ca n't stop swearing			2
' the 35 - year - old explained that before falling ill , @entity4 was a good - natured , well - manned young man			1
' he did n't swear and minded his manners , ' she said			0
' then in june last year , he came home from school rubbing his head and saying it hurt			0
' mrs @entity35 called 999 and @entity4 was taken to @entity10			2
' doctors carried out scans and the results showed a bleed on the brain , ' she said			1
' they told me it could have just come out the blue or he could have knocked himself			0
' @entity4 spent six hours in theatre where surgeons battled to save his life			1
thankfully , doctors were able to stabilise his condition - and they put him in a coma to give his body a chance to recover			1
nine days later he woke up			0
' his face was blank and he could n't speak , ' said mrs @entity35			0
' doctors said the trauma of the bleed and subsequent surgery had caused him to regress			2
he 'd also lost his power of speech and movement			0
' to her relief , his condition gradually began to improve - and a few weeks later he started speaking again			0
last september , he finally got to go home - but there was more drama to come			0
mrs @entity35 said : ' one day i was in the kitchen , when i heard @entity4 yelling in his bedroom			2
' he was screaming " f * * * , b * * * * * * , s * * * "			0
' i wondered what on earth was going on - the expletives were coming thick and fast			0
' @entity4 's mother , @entity26 , said while he always liked cheese , her son has now become ' obsessed ' with it - even putting it on his cereal			1
his mild - mannered temperament has also been replaced with aggression experts say every patient reacts differently			2
' no two cases are the same and there can be physical , cognitive , emotional and behavioural problems as a result of a head injury , ' said a brain charity spokesman upon going upstairs to see what was happening , she found @entity4 munching on an entire block of cheese			1
then , over the next few weeks , she noticed all types of cheese going missing from the fridge			0
' he had always like cheese but now he was obsessed with it - he even added it to his cereal , ' said mrs @entity35			2
' we asked the doctor about it and apparently it 's quite normal for people to develop inappropriate or aggressive behaviour after waking up from a coma			0
so while that explained the swearing , no one can explain the cheese			0
' @entity4 's condition is gradually improving and he now undergoes home tutoring as well as attending mainstream school for an hour each day			2
a spokesman from @entity115 , the brain injury charity , said : ' there can be physical , cognitive , emotional and behavioural problems as a result of a head injury			1
no two cases are the same			0
