by @entity0 a second @entity2 church official , who held high positions in the order up to 2012 , has said he did n't know touching a child ' intimately ' was a crime and would need to get legal advice to find out			1
@entity8 , who was until 2012 head of the orders ' professional standards office , has told the @entity12 into institutional handling of child sexual abuse , he only knew sexual intercourse with a child was a crime in the 80s			1
he was giving evidence in the case of former brother @entity21 who was jailed in 1996 for 67 counts of sexual abuse against boys and girls in @entity26 , @entity27 and the @entity28			1
on wednesday , it was also revealed that three days after it became known that police were investigating @entity32 , @entity8 put the paedophile on a plane to @entity35			1
@entity8 denied repeatedly that he knew police were involved when he sent @entity32 for ' intensive therapy ' to the @entity38 clinic in @entity35			1
@entity2 @entity8 at wednesday 's hearing of the @entity40 @entity41 became involved in 1985 , when as vice-provincial he visited @entity43 's school in @entity44 where the principal had raised concerns about @entity32 's behaviour with primary school girls			1
he told the commission he was not aware in 1985 that @entity32 had a history of abuse at other schools , specifically at a primary school in far @entity27 where the principal had told the order @entity32 was interfering with boys			0
as far as he knew , there were no files the order had that would record his history			0
he told @entity61 , counsel for the commission , that in 1985 he would have considered an adult having sexual intercourse with a child to be a crime but while he knew touching was wrong he would have to check if it was criminal			2
mr @entity61 said : ' are you seriously saying that if an adult touched a child on the vagina , for example , that that was to your knowledge , not a crime in 1985 and 1987 ? ' convicted paeodophile @entity21 was sent to @entity35 for ' intensive therapy ' @entity41 : ' no , i could n't say that to my knowledge that it was n't a crime			1
i certainly could n't say that			0
i would know it would be very wrong and probably criminal , but i would want to go to an expert if it came to a definition			0
' mr @entity61 : ' what if a child was made to touch an adult , a man for example on the penis			0
did you consider in 1985 to 1987 , whether that was a crime ? ' @entity41 said : ' i would consider it definitely to be wrong '			0
he also told the commission he did not interpret ' inappropriate behaviour ' as specifically relating to sexual assault			1
when @entity98 , the principal at @entity43 's informed the order she had sent letters to @entity32 about his behaviour , @entity41 saw them as warning in the industrial relations sense and did not act to remove @entity32			0
he was finally moved in 1987 but @entity41 said he was not responsible for that because it was in the hands of the then provincial @entity107			0
@entity32 was sent to the clinic in @entity35 on august 18 , 1989 and documents produced at the commission showed he was telling people there that when investigations began to surface about his sexual activities with children ' within three days he was on a plane heading for @entity35 '			1
another communication from @entity35 to @entity41 dated august 30 , 1989 stated that @entity32 had said his provincial had decided he should come to @entity38 and this ' was due to the fact that investigations were occurring on himself for school activities five years ago regarding his child abuse '			2
@entity41 denied he had sent @entity32 to @entity35 to avoid the police investigations in @entity125			1
and when he was told that sending @entity32 to @entity35 was first raised by him on august 15 and he was on a plane on the 18th , @entity41 said he did not consider it ' excessive haste '			2
' i did n't see it as excessive haste ; i saw it as continuing the process that we had been through to get him through to intensive therapy , ' he said			1
brother @entity136 has told a @entity12 that during the 1980s he was not aware that child sex abuse was a crime he said it was possible a session was starting in @entity35 and there would be a significant break until he got to the next one			1
at the time , parents of children who were at @entity145 , @entity146 , @entity26 had gone to police alleging @entity32 , who was there from 1984 to 1985 , had abused year five girls			2
mr @entity61 put it to him that the account he gave the commission about the reason for sending @entity32 to @entity35 was false			2
' that is not correct your honour , ' @entity41 said			0
@entity41 also denied that he was the author of a memo which detailed @entity32 's history of abusive behaviour with children going back to the 1970s			2
in that memo the name ' @entity162 ' is used , not @entity21 although the history is @entity32 's			2
' it 's a mystery to me ' , @entity41 said			0
mr @entity61 put it to him that the name was used to deceive a reader on the subject of the memorandum , and readers were likely to be police and anyone involved in civil litigation against the @entity2			2
' i am totally mystified by this document			0
i ca n't make any other assessment of it , ' @entity41 said			0
on tuesday , the former superior of a @entity26 @entity2 community and deputy principal of a school for 600 students also told an inquiry he did not associate child sexual abuse with crime in the 1980s			2
brother @entity136 was head of the @entity186 community to which @entity21 - who was later jailed for sexually assaulting 15 children - was attached from 1985 to 1987			1
brother @entity136 was also deputy principal of the @entity2 @entity189 in @entity44 which had 600 students at the time			1
he gave evidence at the royal commission into child sexual abuse that although concerns were raised with him about the behaviour of @entity32 at @entity43 's primary school , he left it to the school to deal with it			0
towards the end of two - and - a - half hours of evidence he said he considered complaints of inappropriate behaviour by @entity32 as ' excessive expressions of affection ' and had not heard the word pedophile at the time			0
' when you give that answer , that as the deputy principal of that @entity208 college in the mid-to - late 80s in this nation , you did not understand that the sexual assault of children was a crime ? ' presiding commissioner justice @entity204 asked			1
brother @entity136 responded ' i would have to say that 's correct at the time			1
' justice @entity204 asked him if he accepted that part of his role was to protect children			0
' what is the difficulty that you have with accepting that it was a crime , ' @entity219 asked			0
justice @entity204 asked him if he had seen media reports at the time about people charged with sexual offences against children			0
' i do n't specifically remember , but i ca n't rule it out , ' brother @entity136 said			1
justice @entity204 asked : ' is that a serious answer to the @entity12 , brother ? ' to which brother @entity136 replied it was the best he could do with his understanding at the time			1
he said at the time he saw it as his duty to pass on concerns about brothers to the provincial and deputy provincial of the order who headed the community in @entity125			0
brother @entity136 said his awareness grew in time and in retrospect he was sorry for the ' great harm that was done to children '			1
meanwhile , @entity251 's response to child sexual abuse allegations made against two high profile coaches is to come under the spotlight at a royal commission next month			0
the commission will examine @entity251 's reaction to claims made against @entity261 coaches @entity259 and @entity262 .			0

brother @entity8 said he would have had to get expert advice
denied knowing police were involved when he put convicted paedophile @entity21 on a plane to @entity35 for ' intensive therapy '
@entity8 's appearance at @entity12 came on wednesday
the day before , brother @entity136 also told @entity12 he did n't understand sexual assault on children was a crime
