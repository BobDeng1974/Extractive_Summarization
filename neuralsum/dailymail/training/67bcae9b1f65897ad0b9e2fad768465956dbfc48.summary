the season is n’t over yet , though the summer may well be			2
which is why it feels like an appropriate moment to hand out 10 gongs for events that will linger in the memory – and others that may have been instantly forgotten			0
ladies and gents , we give you the @entity12 ... the @entity14 rosette for aptest cliche cricket is a game of inches			0
if @entity20 no 11 @entity19 had not edged the penultimate ball of the @entity22 into his pads , or the final ball just in front of @entity26 in the slips ; if @entity29 ’s penultimate - ball bouncer to @entity30 at @entity31 had cannoned off his arm - guard rather than his glove – if both these things had happened , @entity34 would have kicked off the test summer with a 1 - 0 win rather than a 1 - 0 defeat			1
two tiny quirks of fate meant @entity42 was under pressure again sooner than anyone thought he would be			1
under pressure : a sombre - looking @entity42 after the surprise series defeat by @entity48 the @entity50 big - up for lashing out in his autobiography @entity51 reflects on ‘ being in the zone ’			1
@entity54 bowled better , @entity51 reckoned , when he was n’t sledging : ‘ if he started to chat to the batsmen , i knew it might be time to give him a spell			2
’ @entity60 was different : ‘ the more he spoke , the more the batsmen seemed to fall into his trap			0
that was when @entity60 was in the zone			0
’ just before the @entity66 , @entity42 responded with uncharacteristic prickliness to a question about @entity60 ’s incessant commentary - box goading			1
‘ something needs to be done , ’ he said , probably realising as he said it that nothing , in fact , could be done at all			0
and yet who can honestly say they would n’t have reacted as @entity42 did ? inadvisable it may have been , but it was also endearingly human			1
the @entity79 goblet for mystery jargon @entity82 ’s repeated insistence that ‘ processes ’ matter more than ‘ results ’ seemed designed to infuriate @entity86 fans – and possibly to defend his ever - more indefensible record as @entity66 captain			1
yet no one could be quite sure what these processes were , unless they involved capitulation at the first sign of pace and bounce , swing and seam			0
in which case , we take it all back			0
the @entity103 trophy for @entity105 conservatism not long after @entity106 had smashed 121 off 74 balls in a one - dayer against @entity48 at @entity108 , confirming he was the most exciting @entity34 batsman since @entity110 ’s debut a decade ago , @entity42 declared he was not ready for @entity111			1
@entity112 backtracked the following day , but the damage had been done			0
not only was @entity42 regarded by many as part of a grey cabal responsible for axing @entity110 , he was now fuelling the suspicion that he lacked the courage of whatever convictions are needed to captain your country			1
the same goes for @entity126 ’s absurdly belated ascent to the 50 - over side			0
the selectors corrected themselves when @entity129 disappeared for surgery , but @entity105 cricket is still learning to trust the world beyond the textbook			2
exciting : @entity106 smashes @entity48 all around @entity134 's - but his test debut was delayed the @entity137 certificate for odorous comparisons as the test series began against @entity140 , the most depressing of all @entity34 ’s crises appeared to be the impossibility of replacing @entity143			1
by the time the series was over , we were wondering what all the fuss was about			0
in four home tests against @entity140 back in 2011 , @entity143 had managed 13 wickets at 40 apiece ; in the four in which he bowled this summer , @entity150 could boast 19 at 23			1
this did n’t suddenly make @entity150 a frontliner ( his first - class wickets have cost nearly 39 each )			2
but he looked equally adept bowling to right - handers as he did to lefties – something @entity143 could not always claim			2
and when his batting returns to the heights of @entity31 , @entity34 will have an attack - balancing all - rounder on their hands			1
all - round hero : @entity150 proved surprisingly adept as a test - class spinner this summer the @entity166 blue - ribbon for double - agentry for more cricket - related snippets , feel free to go to twitter.com / the_topspin there is a case – if a mischievous one – for making @entity173 @entity34 ’s player of the series			1
not only did his set - to with @entity30 persuade @entity82 to pursue a charge that was as doomed as it was counter-productive , but his dropping of @entity42 on 15 in the first session at @entity180 was the fulcrum on which the entire summer turned			1
eventually , @entity173 was dropped himself , having taken to charging @entity30 in a headless bid to deal with late inswing and been exposed for what he is : an athletic and capable limited - overs cricketer who has been encouraged to believe his own hype			1
quite what the more substantial @entity192 made of it all is the stuff of caption competitions			0
the @entity198 medallion for solid rocks after @entity143 , the player @entity34 feared they would miss most was @entity201 , the no 3 who for five years had absorbed the worst that bowlers could hurl at him and laid out the red carpet for the middle order			1
yet @entity207 had already demonstrated at @entity208 that he was more likely than the two other debutants there – @entity211 and @entity212 – to cut the mustard			0
much - needed balance : @entity207 has made sure @entity201 is not missed at @entity202 in 11 test innings – one of them unbeaten – @entity217 managed 704 runs at 70 , scored three hundreds and three fifties , and emitted such unflappability ( even , somehow , while falling first ball on the grim fourth evening at @entity31 ) that @entity201 could happily be left to his own devices back at @entity224			2
he even had the good sense to treat the coverage of his big night out in @entity227 with a smile and a spot of self - deprecation			0
the @entity232 cookie for best crisis ( what crisis ? ) @entity42 looked out of his depth at @entity31 and deluded at @entity108			2
he was in the grip of a double whammy that had accounted for so many of his predecessors : no runs and no wins			0
who knows how different his world would look now if @entity173 had clung on at the @entity243			2
the next four innings brought him three scores of 70 - plus , one of them not out			0
his senior bowlers woke up			0
three wins do not a @entity250 make			0
but many of us – this column included – were calling for his head , and he refused to serve it up			2
all smiles : @entity42 's demeanour is in stark contrast to earlier in the summer as @entity34 beat @entity140 @entity261 prize for most lachrymose acceptance speech one or two interpreted @entity30 ’s tears on the @entity31 podium as evidence of a fractured dressing - room			1
this was curious given that @entity34 had just come within two balls of being the first side to bat through the final day of a test after beginning it five wickets down			1
if anything , his upset hinted at a unity that had been missing in @entity277			0
how much did @entity30 want the new regime to succeed ? a tally of 37 wickets – his best in any summer – at 20 each suggested he was probably up for it			1
from tears to cheers : @entity30 was distraught after defeat by @entity48 at @entity31 but the led @entity34 's fightback as they clinched a much - needed series victory against @entity140 best re-enactment of @entity289 ’s @entity288 @entity291 ’s test average now begins with a three			1
six times out of 10 he failed to reach double figures ; on the four other occasions , he did not get to 40			0
in @entity296 ’s more selfish moments , he may be quietly grateful for his team - mate ’s unearthly decline			0
if @entity291 truly is the heir to @entity299 , he could do with a hatful of runs in @entity277			2
( memo in advance : hundreds at home against @entity305 do not count			0
) below average : @entity291 struggled in @entity34 , failing to reach double figures six times out of 10			1

@entity42 started the summer with *people* calling for his head
@entity34 captain ended it *toasting* series victory over @entity140
@entity82 trying to defend his indefensible test record as @entity140 captain
@entity106 held back by @entity105 conservatism
@entity150 has gone a fair way towards replacing @entity143
@entity173 @entity34 's player of the series for winding up @entity30
@entity291 's @entity66 batting average has dropped below 40
