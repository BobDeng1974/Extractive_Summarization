he said : ' there is a lot of speculation , we have got to establish the facts and i intend to do that before we come to a final decision			0

last night , friends of the 54 - year - old presenter expressed disbelief that the @entity8 should make such explosive claims before its internal investigation into the controversy had even begun			1
' i am in total shock that someone at the @entity8 would attack their own talent and deliberately smear @entity3 , ' said @entity163 , who was @entity12 's mysterious test driver @entity165			2
the comments came during a wide - ranging official briefing given to @entity168 by a senior @entity8 figure			0
the executive likened 36 - year - old @entity0 's position to that of @entity137 's victims , who feared they would not be believed while he was alive			1
' the pressure this guy [ @entity0 ] is under is so @entity176 in a way , ' he said , adding that @entity3 's support from high - level politicians recalled the way @entity137 was once defended			2
' if you look at what @entity182 says or what [ former culture and media secretary ] @entity184 says and you swap @entity3 for @entity137 , you get this : @entity182 is effectively saying that @entity137 's a real talent , @entity184 saying @entity137 will be @entity189			0
' the @entity8 executive also said that attempts to suggest the ‘ fracas ’ was part of a wider battle between @entity3 and @entity75 , the @entity8 ’s powerful director of television , were misleading .			1
