@entity1 's youngest daughter has gotten remarried under a historic tree in @entity3			1
@entity4 has a very casual outdoor service on @entity6 outside a coffee shop with her famous father walking across a patch of grass that served as the makeshift aisle			0
wearing a loose , off - white lace dress with bell sleeves , @entity4 made her way towards her groom , realtor @entity15 , who was waiting for her beside the outline of a heart in the shape of rose petals			1
down the grassy aisle : @entity4 was accompanied by her father , former vice president @entity1 , for the friday morning wedding service near @entity3 , @entity22 up close : the wedding was attended by a handful of invited guests ( including the bride 's mother @entity26 seen taking a picture in the foreground ) as well as onlookers who realized what was going on the brief service was officiated by a female religious leader and attended by about a dozen invited guests			1
the rest of the crowd was made of up onlookers - including @entity39 who video taped the ceremony and uploaded it to his story @entity43 - who realized what was going on as soon as they spotted the service going on			0
this is the 35 - year - old 's second marriage , though it is unclear when exactly she and her first husband @entity50 split			2
@entity4 , a @entity51 graduate who enrolled in medical school at the @entity53 before dropping out to become an artist , keeps a relatively low profile in spite of her father 's fame and the latest articles written about her in 2012 noted that she was still married to @entity50 , a surfer and tech investor			1
her new husband , @entity15 , is a realtor at 1 percent @entity63			0
rather than imply something about the wealth of their clientele , the name apparently comes from the realtor 's agreement to only take one per cent of a commission per transaction			0
symbolic : there was no altar involved in the outdoor service but the couple stood inside a heart - shaped ring of rose petals keeping with tradition : the biggest symbol of the ceremony was that the couple married underneath the @entity84 , a historic tree that is the oldest of its kind in the world she is now the only married member of the @entity1 family , as her two sisters - @entity90 and @entity92 - both split from their respective first husbands and their parents @entity1 and @entity26 announced their divorce in 2010			2
both the former vice president and his ex wife were spotted at @entity4 's wedding , standing side - by - side as they watched their grown daughter say her vows			1
@entity4 's first wedding was dramatically different from the low - key affair that took place on friday morning in @entity107 , @entity22			1
in 2007 , @entity4 opted for an opulent affair with hundreds of guests at the @entity110			2
happy : @entity4 , who went to medical school but now is an artist living near @entity3 , split from her first husband sometime between 2012 and this weekend when she married @entity15 ( pictured ) , a local realtor theatrics : in keeping with the ' hippie ' feel of her dress , @entity4 opted for wooden wedges loving it : @entity1 was seen laughing at the big dip alongside his daughter @entity92 instead of a multi-course , sit - down meal that guests were treated to at the first go around , the close friends and family had some coffee and snacks at @entity129 , a coffee shop opposite the wedding site			1
coffee shop manager @entity132 told @entity133 that the couples dozen or so guests dined on huevos rancheros , scrambled eggs and lattes			1
the former vice president must have opted for some of the restaurant 's baked goods instead , since he is famously vegan and does not eat animal products			2
' it was a fun little intimate reception			0
they came in , had breakfast with their wedding party and cut their cake , ' ms @entity132 said			0
@entity150 hearted : @entity15 goofs around with a flower in his mouth as @entity4 cuts the cake on the house : the manager of the coffee shop said that they gave her a strawberry blush cupcake opting for a public venue and a local coffeeshop also has another added benefit : a much lower final bill			2
the cost was likely not a determining factor , however , since the former vice president 's net worth is estimated to be more than $ 200million , a figure that shot up following the eight - figure sale of the tv network he launched , current tv			1
the location of the wedding also makes sense when looking at the @entity1 family 's shared interest in environmentalism , as the ceremony took place beneath the @entity84 pine tree , which is the oldest of its kind in the world			2
the fact that the wedding took place two days before @entity188 may just be a coincidence			0
peace and love : the happy couple posted a photo of themselves holding up ' peace signs ' in front of a peace symbol that adorns the wall in the coffee shop where they had their ' reception ' free spirits : @entity4 and @entity15 posed for a photo near the surf following the ceremony only one of @entity4 's siblings - her sister @entity92 - was spotted in the video that was shot by one of the onlookers			1
neither her sister @entity90 nor her brother @entity212 were seen			0
@entity214 married @entity216 doctor @entity215 in 1997 and had three children before splitting in 2010 , just months after her parents @entity1 and @entity26 announced their own separation after 40 years of marriage			0
@entity221 was the first of the family to file for divorce , splitting from her husband @entity225 in 2009 after four years of marriage			0
introduction to the world : the @entity1 children ( left ) were on stage with the @entity230 and @entity231 ( right ) when @entity1 and @entity50 were nominated to the @entity233 ticket in 1992 earlier break ups : @entity90 and her husband @entity215 ( left ) separated in 2010 and @entity92 and her husband @entity225 ( right ) split in 2009 the marital status of their brother @entity212 is unclear , but stayed out of the spotlight since his father left the @entity242 , making news only on the two occasions when he was arrested for marijuana possession			0
the world was introduced to the @entity1 children in the early 1990s , and the then - teenagers ' appearance at the 1992 @entity249 led to national crushes for many like - minded youngsters			0
they have kept much further from the spotlight in recent years , and the low - key style of @entity4 's wedding is reflective of that change .			1

the former vice president 's youngest daughter has remarried in a low - key ceremony in @entity22
@entity4 , an artist , married @entity15 , a local realtor
her divorced parents attended the small ceremony and only one of her three siblings
wore a lacy , loose off - white dress and exchanged vows under the world 's largest @entity271 tree
the friday ceremony was *decidedly* less opulent than her 2007 wedding to her first husband @entity50 at the @entity110
this time around , guests dined on vegan cupcakes and huevos rancheros
