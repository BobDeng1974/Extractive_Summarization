@entity6 is an @entity7 aboard the @entity8			1
she ’s been there since may			2
so when the @entity11 class of 1988 reunion met this past weekend , @entity6 enlisted the help of @entity14 and attended the gathering via video link from outer space			1
flying high : dr. @entity6 , seen here aboard the space shuttle @entity19 , is now aboard the @entity8			1
but she did n't let that stop her from attending her high school reunion ‘ @entity25 , ’ said classmate @entity22 , as a smiling blond woman hovered on a screen before her			1
‘ welcome to your 25th high school class reunion ! ’ from the space station to @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity6 , 43 , said hello back and proceeded to become the most jealousy - inducing , ego - shrinking high school reunion attendee of all time			1
if there were doctors , lawyers , or self - made millionaires in attendance , even they must have shriveled as their classmate - turned - astronaut spun 360 degrees in zero gravity			0
‘ this is my favorite part of the job , ’ she smiled , while upside down			0
overachiever : @entity6 graduated from @entity11 in @entity29 , @entity30 in 1988 and her career has been skyrocketing ever since what have you been up to ? via video link , dr. @entity6 was able to visit her 25th high school reunion in @entity29 , @entity30 from 220 miles above the earth showing off : @entity6 was able to give her old classmates a tour of the @entity8 and even turned the camera back on themselves , showing them @entity54 from outer space for a group of her old high school chums and their kids , dr. @entity6 gave a tour of the @entity8 as well as a q&a			1
she even gave them a view of themselves , turning the camera towards @entity54 from about a million feet up			0
but the meeting was n’t one - sided			0
say hello , honey : @entity6 's classmates brought their kids in for a q&a with the astronaut as the group caught up with their high achieving friend , they got to share what they ’d been up to as well			1
even if it seemed a little underwhelming by comparison			0
‘ @entity79 , this is @entity80 and my fiance , @entity81 , ’ said a proud classmate			0
‘ @entity80 and fiancé , ’ replied the doctor of mechanical engineering			0
‘ congratulations , i guess i did n't know that			0
’ ' this is my favorite part of the job ' : @entity6 displays her zero gravity skills ‘ they kind of become your extended brothers and sisters , ’ @entity90 said of @entity6 and her other classmates to @entity92			2
‘ so , for her to be able to join us sort of completes our family reunion as much as it is a class reunion			2
’ like a lot of her high school friends , @entity6 is also married and has a 3 - year - old son back on @entity54 and says she swaps videos with them every day			1
@entity6 's mission launched via @entity106 rocket may 28 and is scheduled to last around five more months			2
