by @entity0 and @entity1 given that he has is caught up in one of the world 's most high - stakes divorce battles , you might expect @entity8 hotelier @entity7 to be slightly on edge			1
and this week , the stakes grew even higher when a judge sentenced him to four months in prison for hiding his millions from his estranged wife , fashion designer @entity14			1
but his response could barely be more blasé - the businessman says he wo n't return to @entity17 because he wo n't be able to get a good cup of coffee in jail			1
defiant : @entity7 , left , refuses to return to @entity17 after his wife @entity21 , right , managed to have him jailed mr @entity7 is a well - known figure in his native country thanks to his flourishing hospitality empire , including a boutique hotel in @entity26 and a decades - old restaurant in a quaint village			1
however , this week he hit the headlines thanks to his acrimonious divorce battle , which has seen him and his wife squabbling over their £ 45million fortune			1
the key bone of contention is a £ 13.8million loan a company owned by @entity21 made to a company owned by @entity7			1
naturally , now the couple are no longer together , @entity21 wishes her loan to be repaid			1
@entity14 received £ 40m from her first husband and wants her second jailed for concealing assets at a hearing of the @entity44 of the @entity44 on wednesday , @entity21 ’s barrister - at her behest - said mr @entity7 was in contempt of court for failing to disclose information relating to this loan and urged the judge to jail him			1
the judge agreed , and sentenced mr @entity7 , 52 , to four months in jail			1
but he is currently in @entity8 , and is in no mood to come rushing back to @entity17 to serve his sentence			1
' i ca n’t come to @entity57 , ' he told the @entity58			0
' you do n’t know what it is for me not to go to @entity57 and be condemned to jail			0
' although he refuses to discuss the details of the court case , he claims to have launched rival proceedings in @entity8 against @entity21			1
and he retains a refreshingly light - hearted attitude to his own plight , concluding : ' who would want to come to @entity70 anyway ? the coffee is terrible , especially in prison i guess			1
' on the face of it , former magazine fashion editor @entity21 , 49 , has done very well for herself			1
her first split from @entity76 , the founder of the @entity78 fashion empire , in 2004 , was resolved relatively smoothly			1
to pay off @entity21 , mr @entity76 dutifully sold £ 40million worth of shares in his company and she subsequently received a settlement somewhere in the region of that amount			1
and after the judge 's ruling about @entity7 , one might expect 49 - year - old @entity21 to have felt quietly satisfied when she returned to her £ 15 million property , a five - storey house in one of @entity90 ’s grander terraces			1
after getting husband no 1 to hand over a fortune , she ’s managed to get no 2 banged up in prison			2
that , surely , is a first			0
except it is n’t quite as simple as that			0
their divorce is far from settled — millions remain at stake			2
and the battle between this warring couple is about to become even bloodier than it already is			0
the news that @entity14 is now embroiled in a second epic divorce battle involving many millions of pounds has been met with little surprise in certain quarters among their circle			1
indeed , there are unkind mutterings that @entity21 is a woman who weighs up a potential husband ’s suitability according to the size of his wallet			1
‘ it did n’t go unnoticed that she took @entity76 to the cleaners , ’ says one who knows her			0
‘ she told her friends she was going to take him for everything she could — and she did			0
there are no feelings of warmth between @entity21 and @entity76 now — just loathing			2
‘ no one was surprised when @entity21 married another multi-millionaire			2
she has an uncanny way of latching on to money			0
i think @entity7 was probably warned , but sadly paid no attention			2
’ the couple were married overseas around 2006			0
following their separation , it is understood a decree nisi was issued , but a decree absolute can not be given until a financial settlement has been agreed			0
the @entity44 hearing heard that mr @entity7 had a fortune of £ 8million when their relationship began			1
a large chunk of the couple ’s combined fortune is made up of the money @entity21 took from her first divorce			1
how ironic — and a sort of poetic justice for @entity76 — if she lost it all in the second			0
the couple ’s assets include the house in @entity90 and a luxurious property on the @entity153 island of @entity154 , where @entity21 and @entity7 first met not long after her divorce from mr @entity76 in 2004			1
the daughter of @entity157 and his wife , @entity158 , both hairdressers , she has certainly adjusted well to the lifestyle into which she has been propelled by virtue of her marriages			0
she was born @entity163 in @entity164 in 1964 but changed her name to @entity166 after her mother ’s marriage to @entity166 in 1973			0
@entity21 met @entity76 in 1989 at the launch of the short - lived @entity170			1
he is said to have been so smitten that he proposed that very evening			0
she was 25 and single			0
he was 20 years older , with a daughter from a long - term relationship with the fashion designer @entity173			2
the 49 - year - old former magazine fashion editor walked away with an eight - figure settlement after splitting from mr @entity76 , the co-founder of @entity78 , in 2004 after the couple had three children together and after founding the @entity78 fashion label in 1969 , he was already fabulously rich			1
following their marriage in 1993 , the couple had three children , @entity182 , now 19 , @entity183 , 17 , and @entity184 , 12 , and set up home in @entity186 in @entity57 — one of the capital ’s most rarefied addresses , where @entity21 enjoyed giving lavish dinner parties			2
the family had holidays at their homes on @entity154 and at @entity194 outside @entity195			0
in the mid-nineties , @entity78 launched a new slogan — @entity78			2
the controversy it caused gave the company acres of free publicity and @entity78 flourished			1
mr @entity76 ’s fortune was said to be £ 300 million			0
they were friends with @entity204 and @entity205			0
but in 2004 it emerged that @entity21 had left the marital home , taking the children with her			2
later that year , mr @entity76 was forced to sell the £ 40 million worth of shares , reducing his stake in his company from 51 per cent to just over 40 per cent , to fund his divorce			1
yesterday , mr @entity76 declined to comment about his ex-wife ’s divorce proceedings			0
but a @entity78 spokesman told me that he did wish to point out that his wife had never been a ‘ creative director ’ at @entity78 — as she is described on her internet @entity219 site , which allows business people to network online — but was simply a stylist			2
she continues to maintain she was			0
it has been said in the past that the @entity78 advertising masterstroke had something to do with @entity21 , but the spokesman confirmed yesterday that this was not so either			1
what is true , however , is that the divorce left mr @entity76 well and truly in the doldrums			0
the same year as the divorce , @entity78 announced a severe profits warning and mr @entity76 admitted : ‘ i suppose if someone has a difficult time personally , they might not be quite as focused as they were before			1
’ post divorce , it was reported that @entity21 formed a friendship with a @entity239 photographer , @entity238 , then 35 , living on @entity154			1
@entity240 was said to be not especially keen on hard work , with a liking for wealthy women			0
one associate reportedly said of him : ‘ here on @entity154 , people say that he works not with his brain but his beautiful body			0
’ @entity21 was said to enjoy listening to him playing his guitar			2
but their relationship seemingly never took off and soon @entity21 was introduced to @entity7			1
after their marriage , they divided their time between @entity57 , @entity26 and @entity154 , living for the most part in the house in @entity90 that @entity21 bought with the proceeds from her divorce settlement			1
in 2009 , she and @entity7 bought an art nouveau townhouse in @entity26 and turned it into a boutique hotel , the @entity262			2
@entity21 presided over the interior decoration and decided that a black and white theme would be just perfect			2
so the carpets are black , the doors are black and in the library a black and white tv plays black and white @entity270 films on a continuous silent loop			0
@entity21 ’s other big design project was the house in @entity154 that she and @entity7 moved into in 2010			1
it ’s fair to say @entity21 will be unwilling to let @entity7 have this property			1
it was built especially for her , according to her own vision , a fabulous , minimalistic @entity277 overlooking the sea			0
@entity21 gave an interview to a magazine about the conception of the house , accompanied by photographs of her wearing a bikini and a mahogany tan			2
‘ it was an easy feat to design this house , ’ she said , ‘ given the surrounding beauty			0
’ ( and a little help from three architects			0
) ‘ i tried to incorporate natural elements in the flow of the house , primarily the wonderful light , the reflection of the sea and the welcome breeze			0
‘ this house is all about the sea , the sea and the light			0
for me , the ultimate luxury is taking a shower while being able to look out to the sea — that is complete freedom			0
’ it is , indeed			0
but as painful as it may be , it is possible that @entity21 may not be able to shower while looking out to sea for much longer , if @entity7 gets the house as part of the settlement			1
what caused the split is not clear			0
a source says : ‘ @entity21 can be quite difficult			2
she ’s very hard - nosed and money - oriented and a real man ’s woman , not at all soft			0
perhaps @entity7 just had enough			2
’ for now the wrangling goes on			0
and how much of her fortune @entity21 may lose is not yet known			2
but even if her ex-husband is awarded a big slice of it , all is not lost			0
given @entity21 ’s proven record for attracting multi-millionaires , who could rule out another one coming her way and becoming husband number three ?			1

@entity14 's first husband founded fashion empire @entity78
sold £ 40m of company shares to pay for his divorce
@entity21 claims she loaned second husband @entity7 £ 13.8m and wants it repaid
he was ordered to be jailed for contempt of court after hiding his assets
but he is now in @entity8 and wo n't return to @entity17 because ' the coffee there is terrible - especially in prison '
