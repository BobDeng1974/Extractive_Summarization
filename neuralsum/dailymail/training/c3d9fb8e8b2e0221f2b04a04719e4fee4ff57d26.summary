a glass of wine or a relaxing bath can be the perfect remedy after a stressful day			2
and now you can combine the two without fear of spilling a drop thanks to a new invention			2
a pair of brothers from the @entity10 have created the ' @entity11 ' - a portable cup holder that can hold wine glasses that can be attached to the side of a bath or shower			1
it has a suction pad that sticks to smooth surfaces and it can hold beer cans , bottles , cups , and many other household items			1
unwind : a new invention allows people to relax in the bath while enjoying a glass of wine @entity30 was designed and developed by a small team of drinking enthusiasts , architects , and designers , led by two brothers , @entity36 and @entity37			1
the creators say that the $ 13.95 ( £ 8.91 ) cup holder is ideal for enjoying a glass of wine or cold beer in the bath			1
the device is made of strong , durable , recyclable @entity46 plastic and is dishwasher safe			0
versatile : the product can hold both wine glasses and cans and was developed by brothers in the @entity10 the team say their product is different from other cup holders on the market because of its versatility			1
it can hold bottles , wine glasses , champagne flutes , slim coffee mugs , solo cups , regular cups , and a wide variety of bathroom products weighing up to 24oz			1
@entity36 , from @entity66 , who has a degree in economics from @entity69 told @entity70 : ' i always joked around about drinking beer in the shower			0
when i researched it , there was n't even a quality portable cup holder out there			1
' i saw that a few companies had a wine holder , but that idea has been done many times in the last 10 years and they are all far from innovative : all of them being just a flat piece of plastic with a slit in it			1
' i like baths too and it suddenly occurred to me that i could have a cup holder with a gap in the front that could hold stemware			1
this does n't affect the functionality of the cup holder at all , it actually improves it because it allows it to expand			1
' he added : ' i noticed that while there were all kinds of portable beverage holders available , all of them could hold either stemware or cups and cans , but none were designed to hold both			1
' ' it seemed like a niche we could fill with a novel , cool clean design and offer it in fun translucent colours , specifically for the shower and bath , but useful wherever a suction cup will stick			2
' @entity36 joined forces with his brother , @entity37 , who lives in @entity119 and has a masters in architecture from the @entity122 in @entity123 and his own design / build firm , to make the product a reality			0
after months of research including several rounds of digitally modeling the design and 3d printing the prototypes , @entity30 was launched over the summer			0
sip in the shower : the brothers say their invention is different to other cup holders because it can hold ' stemware , cups and cans ' @entity36 explained : ' my brother did around 10 drawings and prototyped them using a 3d printer			1
we finally came up with the perfect design			0
while it appears simple , a lot of thought was put into the design to hold the largest variety of beverages possible			2
you 'll be surprised how most are a perfect fit			0
it can hold cans from 6oz all the way up to 25oz			1
it also holds almost anything else you can think of			0
he added : ' the designs were extensively prototyped using 3d printing , which allowed us to test and fine tune @entity30 to hold the widest range of drinks possible , with the most efficient use of material and a clean look			2
' @entity167 has really caught on quickly since its release in late august , and we 're looking forward to releasing new colours in the new year			0
' we have recently been able to make it possible to ship internationally at very reasonable rates through our website , and we are fulfilling orders worldwide			0
' cocktail party while you wash : the cup holders have been tested to hold items weighing 6oz to 24oz the cup holders cost $ 13.95 ( £ 8.91 ) and come in different colours but the manufacturers warn you should test the suction before placing a glass in it however , the company warn on their website that users may have to experiment with their cup holder and surface to find the best stick and they advise against using glass			1
they write : ' even though we have the best suction cup , it still has to be applied properly and maintained like anything that involves a suction cup			2
we have found that giving it a little tiny lick or drop of moisture helps maintain the suction even better			0
' in bathroom environments , condensation and moisture on the surfaces may eventually weaken the suction			0
it is recommended to reapply the suction cup before use , and always test the @entity30 before putting in your drink			2
we do not recommend using glass , as accidents can sometimes happen			0
do not apply after there is condensation , make sure the surface is dry first			0
