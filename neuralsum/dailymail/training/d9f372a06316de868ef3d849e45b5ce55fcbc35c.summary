@entity0 is still paying child benefit for 34,000 children who live elsewhere in the @entity3 , despite every major political party wanting to stop the handouts			1
@entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10 have repeatedly called for end to money being sent abroad by @entity3 migrants working in the @entity0 who leave their children in their home country , two - thirds of which are in @entity17			1
but with any deal on scrapping the rules which force @entity0 to export benefits far from certain , it will continue to cost taxpayers up to £ 30million every year until an agreement can be reached with all of the 27 other @entity3 member states			1
they will tour the @entity37 before meeting in @entity38 , when the @entity40 plan for a renegotiation of @entity0 's membership of the @entity3 will be on the agenda			2
the prime minister has made clear that tackling benefits for migrants , especially those exported to families in other countries , will be a key demand			0
under @entity3 rules , the benefit has to be paid to @entity54 nationals who are working in @entity0 and paying national insurance – even if their families are based abroad			1
latest figures obtained by @entity58 reveals that child benefit is paid to 20,660 families with 34,199 children living outside @entity0			1
child benefit is paid at £ 20.30 a week for the first child and £ 13.40 for every other child , regardless of parental income			2
it means the total bill for children living overseas could be up to £ 30million - a - year , although under the @entity3 rules not all awards are made at the full @entity0 rates			1
according to figures for september 2014 obtained by @entity58 under a @entity75 request , the total number of claims has risen slightly since december 2013			0
however , the numbers down down by around a sixth since the general election in 2010			0
amazingly , two - thirds of all claims are made for children in @entity17			2
claims from @entity83 and @entity84 have risen sharply in the past four years , as work curbs were lifted at the start of 2014			0
@entity8 is due to hold talks with @entity34 chancellor @entity33 tomorrow when she visits @entity35 conservative prime minister @entity8 : ' we need are changes that are good for @entity0 and good for @entity54 , they do involve treaty change and proper , full - on treaty change for that matter			1
' crucially , you do n't get child benefit in respect to children that you leave at home with your , your family in other countries			2
' @entity102 deputy pm @entity10 : ' there ’s this thing about us paying child benefit to people who are working here but have got children elsewhere			1
' obviously that ’s absurd			0
i would like to deal with that overnight , but you have to wait for the treaties to change			0
@entity117 's shadow work and pensions secretary @entity115 : ' we will work with @entity54 countries to end the absurdity of child benefit and child tax credits being claimed for children living in other countries			2
' there were 213 claims for 279 children in @entity84 in september , up from just 79 claims for 113 children in july 2010			0
similarly , the number of claims from @entity83 rose from 75 to 236 , covering 404 children			0
mr @entity8 has made tackling the problem a central aim of his plans to renegotiate @entity0 's membership of the @entity3 if he remains as prime minister after may 's election			2
but his promised in - out referendum is not due to take place until the end of 2017 , meaning any breakthrough on stopping the payments remains years off			2
speaking on sunday , mr @entity8 he told @entity147 's @entity146 show : ' we need are changes that are good for @entity0 and good for @entity54 , they do involve treaty change and proper , full - on treaty change for that matter			0
' he added : ' crucially , you do n't get child benefit in respect to children that you leave at home with your , your family in other countries			0
' the comments came almost a year to the day since he made the same argument on the same programme			0
in january 2014 mr @entity8 said it was ' wrong ' that @entity0 paid child benefit for @entity17 workers for their ' family back at home in @entity17 '			1
the comments attracted a furious response from @entity17 foreign minister @entity170 who tweeted : ' if @entity0 gets our taxpayers , should n't it also pay their benefits ? why should @entity17 taxpayers subsidise @entity0 taxpayers ' children ? ' he added : ' @entity0 social security rules apply to all resident @entity3 citizens			1
no need to stigmatise @entity17			0
what about @entity0 children abroad ? ' @entity102 leader @entity10 has suggested @entity17 parents who claim child benefit for their families in their home country should not receive the same amount as @entity0 workers while @entity117 leader @entity9 also wants the child benefit payments to be stopped in november last year , @entity117 's @entity115 used an article on @entity58 to set out her party 's approach to curbing benefits for migrants			1
it included ' ending child benefit and child tax credits from being sent abroad '			0
@entity102 leader mr @entity10 also backs the idea , and has gone further , suggesting that until the payments can be stopped , @entity17 parents who claim child benefit for their families in their home country should not receive the same amount as @entity0 workers			1
the deputy prime minister has ordered officials to find a legal way to slash the ‘ absurd ’ payments made for children who do not live in the @entity0			0
he said it was not fair that @entity0 pays £ 80 - a - month per child , but in @entity17 child benefit is worth only £ 18 .			1

child benefit paid to 20,660 families with 34,199 children outside the @entity0
two thirds of payments are sent to @entity17 , for *22,456* children
the *enforcement* of @entity3 rules costing the @entity0 taxpayer £ 30million - a - year
@entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10 all say payments should end
but agreement is needed with all of the 27 other @entity3 member states
*tories* promise renegotiation before a referendum by the end of 2017
it means action to tackle benefits being exported could be years off
