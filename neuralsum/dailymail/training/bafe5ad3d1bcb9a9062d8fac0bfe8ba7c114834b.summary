by @entity0 as wedding proposals go , it did not appear at first to be the most romantic			2
indeed it appeared more a kidnapping than the start of a wonderful life together			0
a car is chased down a road by a posse of men on motorbikes until one biker pulls up in front of the vehicle forcing it to brake and then stop			0
the driver gets out whereupon he is ‘ attacked ’ by the biker who pushes him onto the bonnet of the car			2
then she is amazed when he gets down on one knee and asks her to make him the happiest man in the world as one of the bilkers opens the boot and produces a bunch of flowers			1
fortunately for him , she says yes and the thumping @entity52 punk soundtrack on the video changes to the decidedly more romantic she ’s @entity54 by @entity55			0
she is furious that he is putting himself in danger and is in no mood to calm down okay , what 's going on here ? she wonders as he goes down onto one knee she can not believe what is happening and assumes that the @entity63 version of @entity64 is about to pop out fortunately for all concerned she says yes and one of the bikers opens the boot where a bunch of flowers has been cunningly concealed it 's all good : she hugs him , he is relieved , the bikers clap and cheer , and the soon to be happy couple can begin preparing their day			1

@entity63 man plans a *big* *surprise* for his *unsuspecting* lover
when he is *slammed* onto the bonnet she seems more angry with him than his ' *assailant* '
her shock is *evident* when he gets down on one knee and produces a ring
