no blame : @entity1 of @entity2 said that she wanted to see the bitterness taken out of most matrimonial disputes divorce laws in @entity8 and @entity9 should remove the need for allegations of adultery and blame , @entity6 ’s most senior female judge has said			1
@entity1 of @entity2 said that she wanted to see the bitterness taken out of most matrimonial disputes so a person does not need to be held at fault in order to obtain a divorce			1
divorcing couples currently have to cite one of five reasons : adultery ; unreasonable behaviour ; desertion for two or more years ; two years ’ separation with consent ; or five years ’ separation without consent			0
the second reason – unreasonable behaviour ’ – is by far the most widely used			0
around 120,000 couples divorce in @entity8 and @entity9 each year and those who want to divorce quickly are encouraged to cite unfaithfulness or unreasonable behaviour , which , critics argue , encourages recriminations			0
@entity1 , who is deputy president to the @entity37 and the only woman among the 12 @entity37 justices , also wants couples to be made to sort out arrangements for children and money before obtaining a divorce as part of the overhaul			1
she told @entity47 : ‘ we should make it take longer to get a divorce and encourage people to sort out what happens to the home , children , money before , rather than after , they get a divorce			2
’ couples would have a one - year ‘ cooling off period ’ after declaring that their marriage had permanently broken down in order for them to sort out arrangements			2
@entity1 , 70 , was behind the move for ‘ no fault ’ divorce in @entity8 and @entity9 20 years ago			2
conservative mps saw off the proposals and said that removing fault would take away responsibility and undermine the concept of marriage			0
last night campaigners and lawyers backed the proposed overhaul			0
resolution : @entity1 also wants arrangements for children and money resolved before divorce is finalised sir @entity76 , former family @entity77 judge and chairman of the @entity80 , told @entity47 : ‘ @entity1 , a complete expert with decades of experience across this whole field , is entirely right			1
‘ our current system which pretends to be fault - based is in practice and reality no such thing			1
' the fault is largely invented to get a quick divorce — a hangover from pre- 1970 days which is manipulated by lawyers and parties			0

@entity1 of @entity2 wants to see ' bitterness ' taken out of disputes
the current system means one person must be ' at fault ' in a divorce
@entity1 suggests year **'s** ' cooling off ' after declaring relationship **'s** end
she also wants plans for children and money sorted before divorce is given
