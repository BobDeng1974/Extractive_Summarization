by @entity0 last updated at 3:22 pm on 1st december 2011 many employers use @entity2 to ' screen ' potential employees - and look at @entity6 profiles - but one @entity8 job application appears to show the company demanding passwords to get access to private messages on @entity6 and @entity13 could employers demand your @entity6 password as part of a job application ? one @entity8 was shocked to find a section in an application form that demanded not only his user names - but also passwords that would give his employers full access to his account , including private messages to other people			1
employers using @entity2 - or ' people search ' engines such as @entity32 - has become a standard part of job applications , and employers also check @entity6			1
but asking for passwords that allow access to private communications is a worrying new precedent			1
in a recent @entity43 survey , 42 per cent of @entity41 students admitted that they worried that posts on ' social ' sites could harm their chances with potential @entity47 least 20 per cent and reportedly up to half of employers check @entity6 accounts as part of the application @entity51 launch of @entity2 's rival plus network was largely sold on the ability to ' control ' which information was visible - but if employers were able to demand passwords , then even this protection would be invalid			1
a recent survey by @entity61 revealed that 20 per cent of bosses also check employees ' @entity6 accounts while at the @entity66 picture , purportedly of a job application for a clerical position with the police in @entity70 , shows a demand for passwords for ' accounts such as @entity6 , @entity13 , etc '			1
the application - purportedly for a clerical position with @entity77 police - asks for passwords which would allow access to private messages , pictures and even friends ' private details @entity84 , the blog which found the job application , commented , ' would you agree to a full search of your home and worldly possessions in order to land a job ? if the answer is no , then you should be just as hesitant to let someone rummage around inside your online identity			1
' various online agencies now offer to ' clean ' people 's online profiles specifically for job applications , and young job applicants often use pseudonyms on @entity6 to prevent employers ' snooping '			1
after a recent scandal about @entity109 bosses rejecting applicants because of @entity6 posts , @entity105 , @entity106 chief economist said , ' we 're starting to see a trend towards people setting up two @entity6 accounts so they can still have an account to share photos with friends and when it comes to befriending workmates and bosses they have a separate account , which they can keep a bit more sterile			1
' be careful : what you post online may come back to haunt you later in life @entity127 , the information commissioner , said : ' in tough times , young people are clearly less relaxed about privacy , particularly in relation to information that they post online - but many may not know what they can do about it			2
' this survey comes after @entity136 , the arbitration service , published a new guide urging employers not to be ' heavy - handed ' by penalising staff for unprofessional comments left on websites			2
employers were warned of the risks of ' googling ' potential recruits and using any personal information from the internet			2
@entity148 , @entity136 ’s chief executive , has advised bosses to be wary about disciplining employees for comments made on social networking websites			2
students are also not taking the threat of identity fraud seriously enough he said : they need to consider the potential impact of any negative publicity			0
heavy - handed monitoring can cause bad feeling and be time consuming			0
' a manager would n't follow an employee down the pub to check on what he or she said to friends about their day at work			0
just because they can do something like this online , does n't mean they should			0
' but at the same time employees need to be cautious about what they post online			0
' online conduct should not differ from offline conduct , ' he said			0
employees should assume everything said on the internet is public , and should consider whether they want their colleagues or boss to read it			0
he said : ' they might not mean it , but what they post could end up being seen by billions of people worldwide			0
' the @entity187 study has been released to coincide with the launch of its new ‘ student brand ambassador ’ campaign - a nationwide project aimed at raising young people ’s awareness of information rights .			0

application form asked for @entity6 passwords
job was for clerical position with @entity8 police
