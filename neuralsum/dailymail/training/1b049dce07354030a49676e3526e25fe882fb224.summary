amazing natural sights such as the the @entity1 or the @entity2 might increase people 's tendency to believe in @entity5 and the supernatural , according to new research by @entity9 scientists			1
the findings suggest that awe - inspiring sights increase our motivation to make sense of the world around us , and may underlie a trigger of belief in the supernatural			1
psychological scientist doctor @entity18 , of @entity19 in the @entity9 , said : ‘ many historical accounts of religious epiphanies and revelations seem to involve the experience of being awe - struck by the beauty , strength or size of a divine being , and these experiences change the way people understand and think about the world			1
@entity32 above : researchers claim that gazing upon amazing natural sights such as the @entity1 ( pictured ) can lead to a belief in @entity5 ‘ we wanted to test the exact opposite prediction : it 's not that the presence of the supernatural elicits awe , it 's that awe elicits the perception of the presence of the supernatural			2
’ dr @entity18 and his colleague @entity43 , of the @entity44 , tested the prediction by having participants watch awe - inspiring scenes from @entity49 's @entity48 documentary series or neutral video clips from a news interview			1
afterwards , the participants were asked how much awe they felt while watching the video , and whether they believed that worldly events unfold according to some god 's or other non-human entity 's plan			1
study : participants were shown scenes from the @entity49 's @entity48 series and asked about religion afterwards			1
pictured are the @entity64 in @entity65 , which featured in the show sneak peak : participants who watched the awe - inspiring clips became increasingly intolerant of uncertainty nature and a connection with the divine has long been observed , perhaps most famously by the @entity74			1
@entity75 was an artistic , literary , and intellectual movement that began in @entity76 towards the end of the 18th century and peaked between 1800 and 1850			0
artists and philosophers who belonged to the movement emphasised the glory , beauty and power of the natural world			2
feeling alienated by traditional religious beliefs , the romantics looked upon nature as the dwelling place of @entity5			0
@entity5 and the natural universe were one and the same			0
they saw nature as a metaphor for the sublime - the power and mystery of forces that inspired awe , solace and self - discovery			2
famous romantic @entity100 held that humans were by nature good but were corrupted by society			0
‘ natural man ’ was close to nature and unspoiled by social institutions			0
the main reason for the development of this strong connection between nature and @entity5 was the @entity111 , which caused many people to leave the countryside and live in cities , separating themselves from the natural world			2
the connection may also have arisen as a backlash against the scientific trend for enlightenment philosophy			0
in addition to this , large areas of @entity76 and @entity122 wilderness had been tamed , so that it had become much safer for people to travel to natural wonders			0
overall , the participants who had watched the awe - inspiring video tended to believe more in supernatural control , and were more likely to believe in @entity5 when compared with the news - watching group			1
the effect held even when awe - inspiring but impossible scenes , such as a massive waterfall through city streets , were presented			1
another study showed that participants who watched the awe - inspiring clips became increasingly intolerant of uncertainty			1
this particular mindset - a discomfort with uncertainty - may explain why feelings of awe produce a greater belief in the supernatural , according to the researchers			1
dr @entity18 said : ‘ the irony in this is that gazing upon things that we know to be formed by natural causes , such as the jaw - dropping expanse of the @entity1 , pushes us to explain them as the product of supernatural causes			2
’ however , the researchers also pointed out that the figures could also shed light on why certain individuals seek to explain the world through secular and scientific means			2
the experience of awe may simply motivate us to search for explanations , no matter what kinds of explanations they are			0
dr @entity18 said this might be why , in another experiment , participants who watched the awe - inspiring video showed greater discomfort and were more likely to believe a random string of numbers was designed by a human hand			1
based on their preliminary findings , published in the journal @entity181 , the researchers are now looking at factors that modulate the effect of awe on belief in the supernatural			0
for example , they are testing whether adopting submissive body postures , which make us feel less powerful , might dispose us to experiences of awe			0
dr @entity18 said such a link could perhaps explain the presence of such postures in religious practice , such as kneeling , bowing , and gazing up			0
he added : ‘ the more submissive we act , the more awe we might feel , and perhaps the stronger our beliefs become			0

being awe - struck prompts people to try to explain the world , a study found
participants were quizzed after watching clips from the @entity49 's @entity48
