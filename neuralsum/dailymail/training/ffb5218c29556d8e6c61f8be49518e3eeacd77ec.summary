the pilot of one of the @entity3 planes that collided at 12,000 feet - almost killing a group of skydivers - has recounted his death - defying leap from the burning @entity8 and shared the selfie he took of his bloody face after he landed			1
@entity11 was at the controls of one of two single - engine planes that were flying over @entity15 , @entity3 , last saturday with a group of experienced skydivers who were making their last jump of the day			1
but what was supposed to be a moment of perfectly - timed air acrobatics and exhilarating free - falls turned into a terrifying jump - for - your - life situation when @entity11 's @entity8 suddenly sandwiched on top of the other			1
speaking about the moment he said : ' and all of a sudden i hear this loud bang			1
i did n't see anything ... i just heard a bang and the windshield immediately shattered			1
he talks to @entity51 about his experience the crash tore off the wing of the plane and the gas tank blew up underneath and caught fire , causing the plane to go into an ' uncontrolled descent '			1
' i was staring straight ahead			0
and the first thing i remember thinking is that i need to regain control of this airplane , ' the 23 - year - old told @entity50 in an exclusive @entity51 interview airing tonight at 8pm			1
' and i immediately pulled the yoke back to my chest and pulled it back as far as i possibly could			0
and there was no reaction from the airplane			0
' i began to pick up more and more airspeed			0
and i realize that i have no control of this aircraft			1
and probably thought it was in my best interest to not be in this aircraft			0
' fortunately he was wearing a parachute and though he had only done two tandem jumps before , he had to recall everything he learned as he jumped head first from the gap where the wing used to be			2
he got himself into the proper arched position for a free fall and withstood the temptation to open the chute immediately , waiting until he was at the recommended 4,000 to 5,000 feet , @entity52 reports			1
he landed hard somewhere near the runway and somersaulted to a stop			0
when he realized he was ok he decided to take a picture of himself to document his injuries			2
had he not , then the 23 - year - old would not have believed he had done what he did , he reveals on the @entity51 special			1
impact : the skydivers were perched on the edge of the plane ready to jump as the other one hit , causing a massive fire bomb impact : this is the moment the two planes hit , sending divers who were preparing to jump flying out of the aircraft and causing the wing of the other to come off incredible : five of the skydivers involved in the @entity3 plane crash can be seen freefalling and the plane @entity11 was flying on flames and hurtling to the ground the photo shows his face covered in blood from the shards of glass that flew at him when the @entity8 's windshield shattered on impact			1
he also had serious cuts on his hands not seen in the picture that took 25 stitches to repair			1
' i did n't have a mirror or anything , so i asked the police officer if he wanted to take a photo of me , ' he told @entity52 's @entity51			1
' he gave me a really weird look , so i decided to take it myself			0
' when he saw the other pilot safely land his plane and then each skydiver parachute to the ground unhurt , he called it a miracle			1
and just like the others said the whole terrifying experience has not put them off skydiving , @entity11 says he also plans to get back into the air , with the goal of one day flying bigger and faster planes			1
' i really feel confident in my ability to be safe as a pilot			0
and i know what i can control			2
and i know what i can not control , ' he said			2
@entity3 skydivers : when asked by @entity50 if they would get back into a plane again after their miraculous escape , all nine put up their hands with one women admitting she is more afraid of spiders @entity169 , left , remembers the pilot screaming at them to ' @entity172 ' , ordering them to jump			1
' that 's probably the worst , was hearing him scream , ' she said through tears			2
' it 's pretty raw			2
' brave : this skydiver describes how me made his way over to the plane that was on fire ( while free falling ) to see if the pilot was ok calm under pressure : blake the pilot describes flying his plane after the collision and landing it safely which , they joked , was one of his better landings one of the skydivers @entity194 told @entity50 on the today show this week that he tried to chase @entity11 's plane that was on fire as he was free - falling to see if the pilot was ok			1
when he saw him jump from the plane , he chased him to make sure he could open his chute			1
' @entity202 had parachutes on , so they were kind of on their own , so i chased the plane			2
i think @entity206 did too , he came down with me , ' he said			0
' we chased the airplane to see if the pilot got out			0
once i saw the pilot bail out , i made sure he was going to open the parachute because he was a student			0
' @entity212 said : ' i thought it was a joke at first			0
obviously not a very funny or appropriate one			0
but it was all so surreal			0
' i thought oh my @entity216 they 're getting closer			0
i expected the other plane to move away			2
' @entity218 , who became wedged in between the two planes and almost collided with the propeller said : ' it was unpleasant			2
i had no time to react ...			0
the sound behind me , i 'll never forget			0
' and that 's all i could do was try and stay forward and try not to move because i knew i was going to live where i was , or thought i could			2
' @entity225 could not contain her emotions while recounting the collision			2
through tears she said she remembers the pilot screaming at them ' @entity172 ' , ordering them to jump			0
' that 's probably the worst , was hearing him scream			2
' @entity235 , who managed to fly one of the planes to safety and land perfectly at @entity240 in @entity241 , joked that it was one of his better landings and said he has no idea how the crash occurred			1
' everything was as it should have been , ' he said			0
' we were just kind of lucky that we were at the point where we were out of the airplane , ' said 64 - year - old flight instructor @entity250 , who was in the lead plane			1
' if we 'd been back in the rear of the airplane when they collided it might have been a little bit different			0
' once out of the plane , the skydivers had to carefully maneuver their chutes to stay out of the path of raining debris			1
' we 're in free fall , so we 're falling about 120 miles miles an hour vertically down , ' mr @entity250 said			0
' but then we open our parachutes , and now all of a sudden they 're falling faster than we are ... fortunately , everybody kept it together so they just avoided ( the debris )			0
' split apart : both wings of the lead plane became detached and @entity250 said he watched it crash to the ground in three pieces falling pieces : several people in the superior area reported seeing the plane falling to the ground but no one was injured by the debris miraculously , no one on the ground was injured by the falling wreckage - but plenty saw them crash to the ground			1
@entity286 lives in the area and often hears and sees the skydivers , but he noticed something was off about yesterday 's jump			1
' i went outside and looked and could see parachuters and a drop plane , and then there was something spiraling down			2
i could n't identify what it was			0
. it had a trail of smoke and i had never seen that before , ' he said			0
happy to be alive : two people hug after all 11 aboard the two planes landed safely quick thinking : the pilot of the tracking plane was able to land it safely , but the lead plane was not so lucky			1
it crashed to the ground in several piece			0
the pilot of that airplane escaped by parachute as well while mr @entity250 still does n't know why exactly the two planes collided , he believes the lead plane may have created unstable air for the tracking plane			1
the @entity318 will investigate the crash today			0
it 's still uncertain what will happen to the skydiving company , since they only owned the two planes			1
but it is the end of their season anyway			0
mr @entity250 says the crash yesterday happened during the fourth jump of his day , and that he 's done over 900 jumps in his lifetime			1
' i 'll remember this one more than most , ' he said .			0

@entity11 spoke to @entity50 for @entity51 about the moment he lost control of the plane
interview will be aired on *friday* at 8pm on @entity52
suffered a number of cuts to his face where the windscreen shattered and had to get 25 stitches in his hand
the only person involved in the two - plane crash with any injuries
*footage* *emerged* earlier this week showing nine skydivers make *emergency* jumps from their planes after a collision
@entity11 's plane can be seen from a helmet cam hurtling to the ground as a *fireball*
