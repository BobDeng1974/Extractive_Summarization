this enormous smartphone could become the most secure commercially available device in the world , according to its designers			1
the boss phone has been developed specifically for security and privacy , integrating @entity8 's operating system with software that ensures online anonymity			1
the $ 355 ( £ 234 ) phone , which has a seven - inch display , routes all of its traffic through @entity16 , the online network that allows anonymity			1
@entity32 , the @entity33 - based entrepreneur behind the project to develop the phone , first came up with the idea after he tried but failed to upload a @entity38 video while attending his brother 's wedding in @entity41			1
@entity16 - short for @entity16 - is a matrix of encrypted websites that allows users to surf beneath the everyday internet with complete anonymity			1
it uses numerous layers of security and encryption to render users anonymous online			1
normally , file sharing and internet browsing activity can be tracked by law enforcement through each user 's unique ip address that can be traced back to an individual computer			2
the @entity16 on the @entity57 hides the ip address and the activity of the user			1
most of the @entity63 's information is buried far down on dynamically generated sites , unable to be found or seen by traditional search engines - sites or pages do n't exist until created as the result of a specific search			0
an internet search is like dragging a net across the surface of the sea - a great deal of information is caught , but a majority is deep and therefore missed			2
access to @entity38 was blocked for two months after recordings that appeared to be of leaked conversations of @entity41 officials discussing @entity80 appeared there			1
mr @entity32 said that he wanted to give people the freedom to use their smartphones without restrictions			1
the @entity86 , or @entity16 as it is also known , uses layers of encryption that can help to defend against traffic analysis			2
mr @entity32 , who had developed a prototype of his device and is now seeking support on the crowdfunding site @entity94			1
he said : ' @entity95 is being manufactured with user privacy as a focus			2
' the devices will be tested by @entity100 project to determine that the included software is configured correctly			2
' this special network and browser is used by everyday people , the military , journalists , law enforcement , activists , and anyone who wants absolutely secure communications and internet browsing			2
' as our mobile devices become more powerful and essential to our daily lives , they ’re increasingly used for more valuable tasks , like banking and shopping , and are , therefore , growing exponentially more vulnerable to a wide variety of online predators			0
the @entity20 , pictured above , has a seven - inch screen and allows the use of two sim cards simultaniously ' in order to protect yourself and your family from known and unknown threats , you need to be aware of the range of security risks and how to prevent them			1
' this is exactly why we are using @entity134 for its encryption capabilities and the @entity16 for secure online communication			1
both of these open source systems provide the most robust and easy - to - use security available globally			0
' however the use of @entity16 may be controversial as it is also exploited by criminals and paedophiles to help mask illegal online activities			1
the @entity145 software will allow users of the @entity20 , above , to browse online without fear that their activities are being tracked , but it could mean that it will be ideal for those looking to hide illegal activities few people have more call for a secure mobile phone than the leaders of @entity155			1
@entity156 uses a specially modified @entity157 that was adapted by the @entity158 to enhance its encryption			0
the @entity161 president recently said that he was not allowed to have an iphone for ' security reasons ' , suggesting @entity165 's device is not considered secure			0
@entity166 , the @entity167 chancellor , apparently has two phones that she uses regularly - a @entity169 that she uses for party matters and a @entity171 for state affairs			0
the @entity157 was modified by @entity174 - based security company @entity173 , who have fitted it with an encryption chip			0
@entity179 president @entity178 uses an @entity162 5 for personal use , but has been given an ultra-secure @entity182 phone with encryption as head of state			0
@entity185 , however , is famous for claiming not to own a mobile phone - possibly as a result of his time spent as a @entity190 spy			0
it houses what is known as the dark net , or deep web , a hidden subsection of the internet that does not show up on searches and is used to share hacked information and trade in drugs and illegal goods			0
recently @entity202 announced a joint special unit from the government spy organisation @entity205 and the @entity206 would use the latest technology to hunt down paedophiles who have been using the dark net to share abusive pictures			0
use of @entity16 may not also guarantee users from having their information hacked as there have been a number of experts who have demonstrated weaknesses in the software			1
however , the @entity20 also comes with additional features , including the ability to use two seperate sim cards , allowing users to switch between different numbers with different carriers			1
mr @entity224 claims the phone will have a battery life of more than 20 hours and its large screen - at seven inches it will be one of the largest phones on the market - should be attractive to those who find small smartphone screens impractical			2
he hopes to begin selling commercial models of the @entity20 by october this year			0
he said : ' lets face it the tiny screens on smartphones are impractical			0
' they are useless for almost everything except texting and calling			0
and even then , if you have big fingers you are in trouble			0
with the @entity20 you are not limited by size			0
' @entity244 's seven inch screen may make it rather impractical to hold while making phone calls ( above )			2

designer @entity32 , from @entity248 , decided to build a prototype after internet restrictions in @entity41 prevented him from uploading videos
the smartphone *combines* the security features of @entity8 with @entity16 anonymity software to ensure privacy when online
it comes with a seven inch display and uses two sim cards simultaneously
the $ 355 ( £ 234 ) phone should be commercially available in october 2015
