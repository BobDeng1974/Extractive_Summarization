@entity0 has urged his @entity2 players to embrace history - rather than fear it - when their aspirations of landing the @entity5 are put on the line in three showdowns with @entity8			1
@entity2 travel to @entity10 on saturday in the @entity12 quarter - final - before a @entity14 clash with @entity16 's men in the @entity17 final seven days later is followed by a @entity19 meeting with the @entity20 the following weekend			1
those three games will go a long way to determining if this @entity2 team have the mettle to become just the fourth in the club 's history to complete a clean sweep of domestic honours			1
@entity0 has urged his @entity2 players to embrace history , rather than fear it , against @entity8 @entity0 says his squad are fully aware that only @entity33 's sides of 1967 and 1969 together with @entity35 's class of 2001 had previously won the league , @entity12 and @entity17			1
but the @entity37 believes they should be inspired by the prospect of matching such heady feats rather than be daunted by it			0
' everyone is aware of that , ' @entity0 said			0
' that 's a positive thing - and we really want it			1
but we have to do it on the pitch			0
@entity2 's @entity48 leaves the field dejected as @entity50 celebrate their midweek win at @entity52 ' there is nothing to fear			1
we are not talking relegation			0
that 's a hard pressure			0
we have everything to win and we are really looking forward to it			0
' @entity8 have done a very good job this year			1
they have been a good team and are going to be a tough opponent			0
we have to be up for the game			1
' the three games between them – they are going to be really tough			0
but to win the championship and trophies is going to be hard			0
the cup is one game so we have to do everything we possibly can before the game to be ready for it			1
' @entity2 blew a chance to extend their lead over @entity77 to nine points on wednesday by losing 1 - 0 at home to @entity50			1
@entity50 's @entity80 holds off @entity2 's @entity81 during the game at @entity52 in midweek yet , @entity0 was reluctant to be overly critical of his players , given the game was their eighth in 26 days			1
' it is not the second and the third and the fourth game that is hard when you play so many games , ' he insisted			2
' it is when you come to the sixth and seventh after each other and also only having three days instead of four between games			2
' it is a big difference because you ca n't get 100 per cent rested			0
you lose 10 per cent against @entity98 and then go into the game against @entity77 and lose another 10 per cent again because you ca n't rest			2
@entity50 's @entity100 clears the ball from @entity2 's @entity102 during the midweek clash ' you saw against @entity50 that the first 25 minutes was good , we were controlling the game , playing quick and getting chances but suddenly it was like a click and the energy was out of the boys			1
' however , @entity0 fully expects his players to be back to their best by the time they arrive on @entity113			2
' this is four days ( rest ) and that is an important thing			2
it is an extra day and also it is not 12pm but 3.30pm so i am glad we play on sunday and we are going to bounce back on sunday – i am confident of that			2
' as well as the absences of cup - tied pair @entity124 and @entity126 , @entity0 has a number of injury concerns			2
@entity126 and @entity124 will miss the game against @entity8 as they are cup tied ' @entity131 ( @entity132 ) got a twisted ankle so hopefully he will be okay , ' he explained			1
' with @entity135 ( @entity136 ) and @entity137 ( @entity138 ) we will have to see but there are possibilities for both of them			0
' with @entity143 ( @entity144 ) we have to think about what we will do			0
he is a possibility but we will be taking a risk with him			0
it is too early for ( @entity150 ) @entity149 or ( @entity152 ) @entity151			0
' pressed on the prognosis for @entity144 's broken finger , @entity0 said : ' @entity143 does n't need an operation but it might be a bit of a risk to play him			0
' @entity138 could return to the @entity2 squad to take on @entity8 at the weekend			1
