father - of - two @entity0 , 42 , dug up the extremely rare @entity3 coin in a field outside the village of @entity6 in @entity7			1
when it was minted 350 years ago , there would n’t have been much change from a slap - up meal and a few of pints of ale			1
today the silver threepenny coin that amateur treasure - hunter @entity0 dug up in a farmer ’s field would probably buy the entire farm			1
the extremely rare @entity3 coin , bearing the date 1652 , is expected to sell for up to £ 1million when it is auctioned			1
it has been hailed as one of the finest examples of a currency produced in the days of the @entity24 in a land that would become the @entity26			1
how the 17th century threepenny bit ended up in the village of @entity29 ’s @entity6 , @entity7 , is not known but last night coin collectors from around the world clamoured to buy it			1
mr @entity0 , who temporarily mislaid the coin at one point , found it while on an outing with the @entity37 to the soil metal detector club on sunday			1
the 42 - year - old father of two had only just started to sweep an area of the ploughed field when he picked up two signals from the detector			1
the first was from a random piece of metal ; the second was from an uneven , hand - hammered coin , about the size of a modern 1p but thinner , buried five inches deep in a clod of earth			1
‘ i dug up the soil and out it popped , ’ he said of the historic find			1
‘ at first i did n’t think it was anything special			2
i knew it was n’t @entity58 , but just how important a find it was , i did n’t have a clue			2
’ the club immediately posted a picture of the coin on its @entity65 page and invited followers to identify it			1
within five minutes , they were inundated with replies			2
one enthusiast wrote : ‘ your mate has just won the lottery ! ’ that evening mr @entity0 took it to his @entity74 home , put it in a jar and showed it to friends			1
in the morning , he could n’t find it			0
‘ i must have knocked the jar over , ’ he said			0
‘ it rolled on the floor somewhere but i just left it there when i went out			0
i had to look around for it when i came back			0
’ on monday , coin expert @entity86 confirmed it was a genuine threepenny piece from the first authorised colonial coinage , commissioned and struck in @entity89 , @entity90			2
‘ i handed it over to him and i think it ’s fair to say he went white as a ghost , ’ mr @entity0 said			1
‘ he said its condition was like the day it was struck			0
’ it was made by placing a blank silver disc on an engraved die , sandwiching it with another die for the reverse side , then hitting it with a hammer			0
the iii in roman numerals shows its denomination to differentiate it from tuppence , sixpence and shilling coins			0
although it bears the date 1652 , the oak tree on one side shows could have been minted in any year between 1653 , when the original simpler design was changed to beat counterfeiters , and 1682 , when a new series of coins was introduced			0
last night it was on its way to the @entity26 for expert cleaning before being offered for sale by @entity132 in @entity133 on december 2			0
five years ago a less spectacular colonial @entity90 coin was sold for $ 430,000 ( about £ 265,000 )			2
one @entity26 auction house estimated mr @entity0 ’s could fetch $ 1.7million – just over £ 1million			1
mr @entity86 said the coin was ‘ a phenomenal find ’ , not only because of its rarity but because it had survived undamaged			2
some coins of that era were ‘ short changed ’ by filing or clipping silver from the edges to sell			0
he said it might have come to @entity3 as part of 17th century transatlantic trading			0
a good tradesman would earn about five shillings ( 25p ) a week in those days – so threepence would have seen him fed in fine style			2
not quite as fine as that which might await mr @entity0 , if the coin reaches its highest valuation			1
the self - employed it consultant plans to split the proceeds with the farmer			2
‘ i think there ’ll be enough to buy me some new clothes and pay a few bills , ’ he said			0
in the era the threepenny bit was minted in @entity89 , @entity3 was undergoing one of the most turbulent periods in its history			0
more than 30 years earlier , the @entity24 had fled religious persecution at home to found the first permanent colony in what became known as @entity3			1
the 102 pilgrims boarded the @entity168 in 1620 and crossed the @entity169 , settling in @entity170 , in modern - day @entity90 , which would remain a separate colony until 1691			2
groups of @entity174 , and others seeking the freedom to worship as they chose denied them in @entity3 , formed neighbouring colonies , including @entity89			0
the years after the @entity24 ’ departure were notoriously bloody in @entity3 , culminating with the @entity180 , which broke out in 1642			1
in 1649 @entity182 i was tried and executed for treason and the monarchy was abolished			0
@entity185 declared a republic – the @entity187 – and invaded @entity188 and @entity189 , slaughtering thousands to expand his power			0
following his death in 1658 , @entity182 was restored as monarch			0
back in the @entity195 , while at first the colonists relied on help from the native american indians and each other , they gradually began to develop trade links with other lands – including @entity3 .			0
