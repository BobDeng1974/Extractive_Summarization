by @entity0 published : 18:02 est , 10 august 2013 updated : 18:54 est , 10 august 2013 dream role : @entity2 as the governess in this summer 's production of @entity5 @entity2 – otherwise known as ‘ the new @entity6 ’ – is fizzing with excitement			1
at only 22 , she is receiving the sort of rave reviews that actors dream of all their lives			1
her current performance as @entity13 in @entity5 at @entity14 in @entity15 has been described as ‘ superb ’			1
@entity16 , @entity18 ’s theatre critic , whose review can be found in @entity20 , gives the musical five stars and advises readers to ‘ climb every mountain , ford every stream , follow every rainbow , do whatever you need to get a ticket ’			2
even @entity29 , @entity30 senior vice-president of the @entity32 organisation , who has seen more versions of the musical than he can count , thinks she ’s ‘ wonderful , wonderful ’			2
the production is the summer ’s hottest ticket , and @entity39 is clearly on the verge of stardom			1
yet it ’s not only her youth that makes her talent so remarkable			2
she owes the drive that has made her success possible to climbing a substantial mountain of her own			1
she suffered years of bullying at school and went through a period of unemployment in which she so despaired of ever working again that she put on almost two stone by comfort eating			1
but the real source of her determination to achieve her dream is her sister , @entity60 , who had a devastating stroke soon after birth and suffers from learning difficulties			1
@entity60 , now 16 , is @entity39 ’s inspiration			1
‘ she is a lot like me – opinionated , strong - willed and passionate , ’ says @entity39			1
‘ she has taught me patience and understanding and when i think of the amazing things she could do if she was fine it makes me feel i do n’t want to waste any of my own talent			1
’ taking on an iconic and demanding role in a musical that has been seen by virtually everyone is no easy task			1
@entity39 flicks back her specially dyed and dramatically cropped blonde hair as she discusses the daunting prospect of donning the famous @entity6 wimple			1
‘ my gran had the video and i used to watch it all the time as a child			2
it was nerve - racking to take over from @entity6 and initially i felt i would n’t be able to do it			2
‘ but when i read the stage script , which is slightly different to the film version , i saw a naivety and youthful energy in @entity13 that i felt nobody had really seen before			2
youthful energy : @entity39 dances with two of the @entity92 children in the new production @entity95 creator @entity94 so disliked the 1964 @entity97 film version of her stories about the magical nanny that she tried to stop the company adapting them for the @entity102 stage			1
sir @entity103 , who eventually co-produced the stage adaptation , has revealed how the @entity106 - born author repeatedly turned down requests from @entity97 to produce a theatrical version			2
‘ for 30 years she would n’t even agree to meet them , ’ he said			1
sir @entity103 has spoken out as a new @entity113 film called saving mr @entity114 promises to shed fresh light on the making of the 1964 film			2
@entity118 plays the role of @entity120 while @entity121 portrays @entity97			1
in one scene @entity120 tells @entity97 : ‘ @entity95 is not for sale			2
i wo n’t have her turned into one of your silly cartoons			2
’ sir @entity103 – who negotiated with @entity120 about a stage production in 1993 , three years before she died – insisted that any stage version would need to combine elements of her books and the @entity97 film			1
he said : ‘ i think she realised it was the best chance of getting a musical nearer to what she wanted			2
’ no one from @entity97 was available for comment last night			2
‘ she was supposed to be 22 , the age i am now , and @entity6 was 30 when she played her			1
so it ’s not surprising that her performance was quite staid and controlled			2
i felt i could give the role a younger , sexier , more modern edge			1
it also helped that i could see a lot of myself in @entity13			2
we are both enthusiastic and driven and throw ourselves wholeheartedly into everything we do			2
’ @entity39 ’s talents were obvious early on			1
she went to ballet and tap lessons and starred in theatre productions			0
although her school , @entity154 in @entity155 , was proud of her success , other students began verbally bullying her			1
‘ i think it was based on jealousy , ’ she says carefully			0
‘ looking back , i can see it helped me build a thick skin			0
it ’s something you need to have in this industry			0
luckily , i am still very sensitive underneath			0
’ this is partly due to @entity60 , whom @entity39 adores			1
‘ i was six when @entity60 was born , ’ she recalls			1
‘ she could have been very disabled but fortunately she only has mild special needs			0
she manages at @entity166 with some extra help			0
i think of her as my baby sister and am very protective of her			1
‘ she has recently won an award at school for being the most inspiring student			1
i ’m particularly proud as she was nominated by the other pupils , which for a child who struggles with her speech is amazing and really choked me up			0
’ inspiration : @entity39 , left , said it was ' nerve - wracking ' to be following in the footsteps of @entity6 , right , taking on the famous role of @entity13 in @entity5 original : the iconic actress with the @entity92 children in the beloved film released in 1965 @entity39 left school after gcses , making the difficult decision not to go on to a-levels and drama training when she was offered the part of @entity191 in the rock musical @entity193 in the @entity102			1
‘ i had a blast but then suddenly , when i was 19 , everything came to an abrupt stop			0
i kept going to auditions but did n’t get anything			0
i did n’t know how to deal with the inactivity and not earning			0
‘ i was living alone in @entity15 and i was really sad			0
i put on about two stone eating chocolate and other comfort food			0
i was out of work for six months and thought i ’d never work again , but i auditioned for the part of @entity205 in the touring version of @entity207 ! i got it and spent a year going around the world			0
’ she later joined the @entity102 cast and , while performing at night , auditioned for @entity5 during the day			0
‘ i did six auditions and thought i might get the part of @entity213 , the eldest of @entity92 ’s seven children			0
instead they offered me @entity13 , which was really scary			0
it made me work hard on my voice because singing in @entity5 is very different from singing @entity220 pop songs			0
’ it obviously paid off			0
her voice is sweet , emotional and powerful – the equal of @entity6			0
‘ being in @entity5 is a brilliant experience , ’ she says			0
‘ i particularly love doing it in the open air			0
it ’s funny to think i ’m at the age when i thought i would be graduating from drama school			1
instead , i ’m astounded by the reviews and having the most amazing time			1
’ judging by the rapturous cheers and applause that echo through @entity14 every evening , so is the audience			0
