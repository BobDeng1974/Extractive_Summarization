a quarter of people living in @entity4 ’s biggest cities are immigrants , an official analysis showed yesterday			0
a study of census figures revealed that nearly one in three big - city residents is a member of a non-white ethnic minority , and that nearly one in ten homes has no - one who speaks @entity14 as their main language			1
the figures were put together by the @entity17 from the results of the 2011 national census in the four biggest built - up areas : surrounding @entity21 , @entity22 , the @entity23 and @entity24			1
different backgrounds : nearly one in three big - city residents is a member of a non-white ethnic minority , and almost one in ten homes has no - one who speaks @entity14 as their main language in these conurbations , more than 25 per cent of the population were born abroad			1
being born outside @entity4 is accepted by the statisticians as the best measure of who is an immigrant			2
the figures mark a major change since 2001 , and reflect the high levels of immigration from both @entity39 and outside @entity39 that were encouraged during @entity40 ’s years in power			0
the census returns of 2001 showed much lower ethnic minority populations than in the @entity17 analysis of 2011 , although the latter uses different boundaries			1
the 2001 census said that in @entity21 75.9 per cent of the population was born in the @entity4 , in @entity22 92.1 per cent , in the @entity23 88.8 per cent , and in @entity24 91.2 per cent			1
in 2011 , in the same local government areas , the @entity4 - born population of @entity21 was down to 63.3 per cent ; @entity22 87.9 ; the @entity23 83.4 ; and @entity24 88.5 per cent			1
the latest figures also suggest that nine per cent of homes in the big cities have no - one who speaks @entity14 as their main language			2
the @entity17 said that this compares with one per cent of homes in villages and small towns			0
the broad picture of the make - up of the cities is taken from an analysis of built - up areas carried out for the first time in 2011			2
the figures apply to areas which are considered to be ‘ irreversibly urban in character ’			0
immigration : census figures showed 13.3 per cent of the @entity14 population as a whole were born abroad the four major conurbations each have well over a million inhabitants			1
behind them come seven ‘ large built - up areas ’ , each with between half a million and a million people			2
the countryside is disappearing around the biggest cities , officials admitted yesterday			0
@entity21 now stretches from @entity81 in the north to @entity83 in the east and @entity85 in the south west , according to the @entity17 analysis			2
in the north , @entity88 and @entity89 have effectively joined up to form a single conurbation			0
planning rules and green belt laws have failed to curb urban sprawl in some areas , the @entity17 said			0
these are @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 and the area surrounding @entity103 and @entity104			0
second - tier cities have been much less affected by immigration than the big conurbations , the report said			1
the four major cities had more than double the proportion of people born abroad than the seven large built - up areas – 25.3 per cent against 11.4 per cent			1
@entity114 figures published last year showed that 13.3 per cent of the @entity14 population as a whole were born abroad			1
earlier this week , it emerged that more than a million schoolchildren have @entity14 as their second language			0
@entity120 figures show the number of pupils aged five and upwards speaking other first languages in primary , secondary , special and pupil referral units has risen by almost 54,000 to 1,061,100 .			0

nearly one in three big - city residents is a non-white ethnic minority
