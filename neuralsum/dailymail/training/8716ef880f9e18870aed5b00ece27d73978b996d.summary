' he said the company would remain focused on improving its profitability and efficiency while driving innovation in the next fiscal year			0
the handset 's performance is widely seen as being key to the company 's future fortunes ' we have built an engine that is able to drive improved financial performance at lower volumes , which should allow us to generate additional benefits from higher volumes in the future , ' he added.the one million @entity2 phones sold bettered analysts ' expectations of about 915,000			1
when the @entity2 touchscreen device was unveiled , mr @entity25 welcomed a ' new day in the history of @entity0 ' following what he termed the most challenging year of his career			0
