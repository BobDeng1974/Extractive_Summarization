by @entity0 and @entity1 families will have to prove their child ¿ s vaccination records are up to date to qualify for handouts , said @entity7 mp @entity6 parents should lose their child benefit if they refuse to immunise their children with the @entity12 jab , a senior @entity7 mp has suggested			1
families will have to prove their child ’s vaccination records are up to date to qualify for handouts , said @entity6 , who is leading the party ’s policy review			1
the mp for @entity20 & @entity21 suggested the measure , which is already in place in @entity24 , could be a way to link behaviour with state benefits and services			1
however , @entity7 rushed to dissociate itself from the idea last night , saying ‘ it is not part of the policy review ’			1
shadow chancellor @entity33 said : ' there is no question of a @entity7 government ever taking child benefit away or punishing parents for choices they make on vaccinations			1
' i do n't know where that came from			2
it is not our policy			2
it is on the front of the newspapers but it is not true			2
' we would never say child benefit is conditional on taking a jab , ' he told @entity56 's @entity55			2
the idea emerged after the uptake of the measles , mumps and rubella ( @entity12 ) vaccine has dropped to dangerously low levels in some areas			1
the risks were underlined earlier this year when more than 1,000 people caught measles in @entity68			0
one victim , a man aged 25 , died			0
a senior party source said : ‘ this is an example of the sort of measure which we want to see that ties public goods to how people behave as citizens			1
’ when he was still in power this summer , @entity24 prime minister @entity80 announced that people who did not immunise their children would be denied some benefits to boost vaccination rates for diseases such as whooping cough and measles			1
exemptions would only be made on religious or medical grounds , he said			0
controversy has surrounded the @entity12 vaccine since the 1990s , when it was wrongly linked to autism in a now discredited study by the scientist @entity93 , published in the @entity95 journal			0
dr @entity93 , who was struck off over the scandal , said officials had appeared to be more concerned about protecting the @entity12 programme than they were about protecting children			0
@entity6 , the mp for @entity20 & @entity21 , suggested the measure , which is already in place in @entity24 , could be a way to link behaviour with state benefits and services he wrote on a website that in 1998 , following an analysis of studies of the safety of the vaccine , he recommended the use of single measles vaccine in preference to the combined @entity12 jab			1
‘ this remains my position , ’ he said			0
in 2001 , @entity117 faced criticism after he refused to disclose whether his son @entity119 was vaccinated with the @entity12 jab			0
although the @entity121 hinted that @entity119 had been immunised , the former prime minister ’s move to keep the decision a secret was blasted as it came at a time when there were public doubts over the safety of the vaccine			2
it was not until seven years later in 2008 @entity131 confirmed in her autobiography speaking for @entity133 that @entity119 had in fact been vaccinated			0
babies under six months can not have the @entity12 vaccine			0
they usually have some antibodies passed on from their mother .			0

@entity141 would have to prove vaccination before handouts , says @entity6
part of drive to link public goods to *changing* the behaviour of citizens
but @entity7 *quickly* *distanced* itself from the idea of linking jabs to benefits
