by @entity0 a fish handler 's cured hand warts has lead researchers to look at @entity5 sea snails as a potential cure for common cold sores and the related herpes virus			1
the blue blood of abalone , an edible sea snail found in pristine bays along @entity5 's coast , contains anti-viral properties that researchers have shown block the herpes virus ' entry into cells			1
the abalone 's healing properties were uncovered completely by accident , researchers say			0
the blue blood of abalone , an edible sea snail found in pristine bays along @entity5 's coast , contains anti-viral properties that researchers have shown block the herpes virus 's entry into cells @entity30 from @entity31 said 10 years ago when the company was involved in abalone serum trials relating to cancer treatments , patients who drank processed forms of abalone blood reported fewer cases of cold sore breakouts			1
' around the same time we had an employee responsible for loading and unloading abalone shells containers , ' he said			0
' after a month of working with the shellfish he found that the viral warts which had plagued his hands for years disappeared			0
researchers @entity43 and dr @entity45 from the @entity46 are among those working with the herpes virus cell and blue blood of abalone the abalone 's healing properties were uncovered completely by accident , researchers say ' this convinced me that abalone had to be investigated for its anti-viral properties			2
' mr @entity30 said he then started working with chemical engineers at the @entity46 and virus researchers at the @entity58 on the breakthrough research			0
the research has shown the same protein that gives the abalone blood its blue colour also has anti-viral properties			2
the research has shown the same protein that gives the abalone blood its blue colour also has anti-viral properties professor @entity68 , from @entity69 , said while current treatment can shorten the disease , it can not kill the virus			1
' with the information we now have , we are hopeful that we can develop an anti-viral therapy that will prevent or reduce recurrence of the virus and / or hasten healing of the lesions , ' prof @entity74 said .			0

blue blood of abalone contains anti-viral properties that block herpes virus ' entry into cells
the edible sea snails are found in bays along @entity5 's coast
research shows the same protein that gives abalone blood its blue colour also has anti-viral properties
