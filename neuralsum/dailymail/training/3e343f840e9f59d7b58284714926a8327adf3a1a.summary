jobseekers from the @entity2 are to be barred from having their wages topped up by the state , @entity0 has revealed			1
the @entity5 told @entity7 people who come to the @entity8 will not be able to claim universal credit , which is replacing all of the main out - of - work benefits and tax credits			1
mr @entity0 ’s intervention fuelled speculation that a bar on access to the new credit will be a centrepiece of a keenly - anticipated speech by @entity19 on how the @entity20 plan to reduce @entity8 ’s lure as a destination for @entity2 migrants			1
the government has announced a series of measures to crack down on those who come here to claim out - of - work benefits , with a six - month waiting period being introduced within the next few months			1
but critics argue the bigger issue is the generous top - ups to low paid jobs that are offered by @entity44 ’s complex system of tax credits			2
research by the @entity48 think - tank suggested a foreign worker with two children earning the minimum wage sees a basic income of less than £ 200 a week propped up with an additional £ 330 in tax credits and other benefits			1
new jobseekers arriving from the @entity2 will be prohibited from applying for the new benefit , it is believed yesterday , in the @entity58 , mr @entity0 said universal credit was a ‘ different kind ’ of benefit and suggested it would not be offered to those who come to the @entity8			1
the @entity63 is understood to have drawn up plans for @entity65 to use the universal credit system to reduce the attractiveness of the @entity8 to migrants from the @entity2			1
ministers are expected to argue that restricting access to the benefit will not breach @entity2 rules on the free movement of workers , since it is not primarily designed to facilitate access to the labour market			1
‘ @entity79 credit is not primarily a job - seeking benefit , ’ said one source			2
‘ it ’ s an anti-poverty , anti-welfare dependency benefit			2
‘ national governments in the @entity2 are perfectly able to control who accesses those sorts of benefits – and @entity2 jobseekers will not be able to claim			1
‘ this is a payment for people who are both in work and out of work , and it ’s there to support them and push them along a path that will free them from dependency on the state			2
‘ it is the end of tax credits , which are hugely expensive and allow bosses to pay wages that workers ca n’t exist on			0
it ’s a subsidy from the government for low pay			0
’ @entity19 , pictured , is expected to make some major announcements during an immigration speech mr @entity19 has promised new measures to bring immigration under control in his proposed renegotiation of @entity8 ’s relationship with @entity116 , and is expected to set out detailed measures in a speech that could come as early as later this week			1
@entity79 credit combines income - based jobseeker ’s allowance , employment and support allowance , income support , child tax credit , working tax credit and housing benefit in an attempt to simplify the @entity129 welfare system			0
crucially , it means it is always worth people ’s while to take a job or more hours if they already have one			0
the government says that more than 30,000 people have now moved onto universal credit , which is available in more than 60 jobcentres			0
by @entity139 , the scheme will have been extended to nearly 100 jobcentres , predominantly in the @entity141			0
mr @entity0 admitted the original 2017 deadline for all claimants to be transferred to the new benefit had been ‘ artificial ’ , and said he made ‘ no apologies ’ for slowing down its introduction to avoid the sorts of errors that plagued the tax credits system			1
it is expected to take until 2019 to put all claimants on to the system , though it will apply to all new claimants – including migrants – far sooner			2
mr @entity0 told mps the credit would bring £ 35bn in economic benefits to the @entity8 , and is now being extended to parents for the first time			1
today , a report from the @entity162 cautions that billions of pounds are at risk if the government fails to stick to its ‘ challenging ’ timetable for introducing new it systems to run the universal credit system			0
ministers have failed to put contingency plans in place to cope with any setbacks in the digital service being created to deliver payments , it said			0
the programme is already six months behind schedule and a further six month delay could mean a £ 2.3 billion loss in the societal benefits expected from people being moved into work and off benefits , it warned			2
@entity44 ’s @entity184 said universal credit was being introduced at a ‘ glacial pace ’			0
the party has said it will review the system if it wins power next may			0
miss @entity184 will claim today that the government is set to spend more than £ 5 billion more on tax credits than it expected over the five years of this @entity192			0
@entity44 will blame the overspend - revealed in figures from the @entity195 - on rising levels of low pay , which have left more people reliant on in - work benefits			2
‘ this is yet another example of @entity20 welfare waste : billions more of taxpayers ’ money spent on in - work benefits , 900,000 people waiting for a combined 118,000 years in a huge backlog for sickness and disability benefit assessments			1
and the shambles of @entity211 leading to huge delays and over £ 130 million of taxpayers ’ money already wasted on failed it , ’ she will say			0
a @entity20 spokesman said : this is desperate stuff from @entity44 – the party which let the benefits bill double , including a 340 per cent rise in tax credit spending			1
what ’s more , they ’ve opposed every single step we ’ve taken to put things right			0
our welfare reforms are set to save £ 50 billion over the course of this @entity192			0

@entity0 is planning a *clampdown* on benefits for @entity2 nationals
the @entity20 want to make the @entity8 less attractive for immigrants
new research has branded the @entity8 ' a honeypot destination ' for migrants
@entity19 will make the announcement during a major speech
