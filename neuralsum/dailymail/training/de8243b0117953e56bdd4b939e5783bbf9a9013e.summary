by @entity0 a council spent £ 23,000 of taxpayers ' money trying to gag reporting of a case where it had placed a four - year - old in foster care with a suspected paedophile			1
@entity10 tried and failed to obtain a @entity12 injunction which would prevent embarrassing details of the case being made public			1
social services took nearly three weeks to remove the girl from a foster family , despite the father being under suspicion of possessing indecent images of children			1
@entity10 has been branded a ' disgrace ' for leaving a girl with a suspected paedophile and then trying to hush it up using taxpayers ' money he later killed himself after police took a laptop away from the property which contained a cache of child abuse images			1
despite the little girl and the children of the suspected paedophile being automatically granted media anonymity , the council still tried to obtain a blanket gagging order			2
on the final day of the two - week hearing in october last year , the council 's barrister @entity37 went to the civil court to get an injunction banning any reporting of the case			1
temporary restrictions were then put in place to prevent publication of @entity10 , or the names of the social service workers who failed to protect the little girl			1
but these were overturned in @entity51 's @entity12 in january following a costly three - month legal wrangle			1
mr @entity53 ruled it was in the public interest for the story to be published , but that the identities of the girl , her family and foster family should all be protected			2
a @entity63 request has now revealed that the ' external cost ' of the legal wrangle to @entity10 came to £ 23,528,40			2
@entity10 's expensive bid to stop their errors being reported was overturned in @entity51 's @entity12 but the true cost is likely to be much higher as the quoted figure does not include the time council employees spent working on it			1
the hefty bill included £ 11,730 for legal advice , preparation and representation by @entity76 for two @entity12 hearings in @entity51 and one in @entity79			2
the council also paid the legal costs for the foster family , which came to £ 3,623.40			0
however , a spokesman for @entity10 today insisted the legal action was only taken to protect the identity of the child			1
' the object throughout was only to protect the identity of the child , ' he said			0
' it is important to realise that automatic reporting restrictions in respect of children subject to care proceedings do not last once the proceedings have ended ... ' the council did not think that this was in the child 's best interests and , as the press were already involved and had attended some of the hearings in relation to the care application , we considered that we had no option but to seek to protect the identity of the child beyond the care proceedings			1
' mr @entity53 said @entity10 's bid to cover up its errors was ' unjustified ' , adding : ' it is in the public interest for these matters to be published ' the case at @entity79 's @entity114 heard that concerns were first raised in march 2012 when the girl had been living with the family for three months			1
police informed social services that child sex abuse images had been accessed at the house for the second time			0
unlike the first incident , which was blamed on a foster child at the house , the police strongly suspected the father had accessed the sick images			2
but despite being informed by police , social services did nothing for two weeks , leaving the little girl where she was			0
the child also told her real father and a social worker that she had been ' strangled ' by another child at the foster home , but still she was returned to the house			0
social worker @entity141 told the hearing , chaired by @entity143 , that there was ' not enough information to justify immediate removal ' of the girl when the allegations arose			0
the child 's appointed legal guardian said : ' i think we have to bear in mind that she may have been sexually abused in that foster placement			1
' chairman of the magistrates mrs @entity143 criticised @entity10 for not following child protection procedures , saying : ' these matters concern us greatly and we believe should be thoroughly and forensically investigated and reviewed in an independent forum			2
' no disciplinary action has been taken against anyone from social services following the council 's internal review , but an independent review has not yet been published			0
high court judge mr justice @entity53 said the authority 's bid for a gagging order was ' unjustified ' , adding : ' it is in the public interest for these matters to be published			0
' the girl is now in a new foster home			0
but speaking at the time of the court hearing , her natural father said : ' i am livid			0
' they said she was n't safe at home but they put her where someone had been downloading child abuse images			0
' he added : ' there is a danger that those who practise in the family justice system fail to give proper consideration to the @entity192 10 rights of the media			0
' @entity196 , campaign manager of the @entity197 , said : ' this was a shameful attempt to suppress the media from reporting council bungling			0
' it 's a disgrace that @entity10 have spent taxpayers ' money trying to hide its involvement in a very serious and disturbing case			1
' questions must be asked not only of those responsible for the mistakes in the original fostering case but also of whoever authorised the use of taxpayers ' money for the legal action to cover it up			0

its expensive bid to hush the *scandal* up cost *thousands* and was overturned at the @entity12
