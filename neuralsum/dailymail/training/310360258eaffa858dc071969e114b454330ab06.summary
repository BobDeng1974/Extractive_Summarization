by @entity0 published : 05:30 est , 25 january 2013 updated : 10:23 est , 25 january 2013 after losing a presidential election it is only natural to enter the prescribed period of soul searching , followed by the question : ' what if thing 's had been different ? ' but rather than accept their lot and strive to fight harder next time round , some @entity8 want to change the electoral rules in a bid to make it easier for them to win in four years			1
on wednesday , @entity14 's @entity8 - controlled @entity13 proposed a bill that would allocate electoral votes by congressional district , instead of the current winner - take - all system			1
what could have been : if the system had been based on proportional representation and allocated electoral votes by congressional district , @entity21 would now be president the current system : @entity27 was elected president in november by 332 electoral votes to 206 indeed , under such a system @entity21 would have won last november 's election with a larger proportion of congressional district votes			1
in @entity14 , for example , president @entity27 would have claimed just four of the state 's 13 electoral votes in the 2012 election , rather than all of them			1
senator @entity39 sponsored the bill saying his rural constituents in @entity42 feel ' that their voices are not heard ' in general elections , adding : ' the last election , constituents were concerned that it did nâ€™t matter what they did , that more densely populated areas were going to outvote them			0
' so close : under such a system @entity21 would have won last november 's election with a larger proportion of congressional district votes he said only in @entity53 and @entity54 are votes awarded based on turnout in each congressional district			1
but critics have labelled it the ' sore losers ' bill ' , arguing that it would produced a ' skewed election ' where a candidate could win the popular vote in a state but still lose a proportion of electoral college votes			1
what if ? in @entity14 , under the @entity8 's proposed new system , president @entity27 would have claimed just four of the state 's 13 electoral votes in the 2012 election , rather than all of them @entity77 @entity76 mayor @entity75 is urging people to sign a petition against the bill			1
in an open email , he wrote : ' we ca n't sit silently by as they try to manipulate the democratic process for political advantage			0
under the current electoral college system , the candidate who wins the popular vote does not necessarily win the election			1
each of the @entity92 's 50 states has a number of electoral votes based on its size - the largest , @entity96 , gets 55 votes while @entity98 has just three			2
every four years , @entity92 head to the polls to choose their preferred candidate for president and vice-president			0
in all but two states ( @entity53 and @entity54 ) , the candidate who wins the majority of votes in a state wins all that state 's electoral votes			2
the first candidate to reach a majority 270 votes out of 538			0
but @entity8 in @entity14 say the system is unfair			2
they want a system that works more like that of @entity54 and @entity53 , where electoral votes are allocated by proportional representation			2
it means the candidate with the most votes in each of those states wins two electoral votes , for their two senators , before the remaining electoral votes are doled out by congressional district			1
' we ca n't let them attack the very democratic institutions and rights that others have sacrificed so much to gain - just because they do n't believe they can win in a fair election fight			0
' similar changes are reportedly also being considered in @entity133 , @entity134 and @entity135			0
they , like @entity14 , all helped vote @entity27 into the @entity138 in the past two elections but are controlled by @entity8 at the state level			2
but the proposals have not been welcomed by all corners of the @entity8			0
@entity144 's @entity143 chairman @entity143 said : ' the @entity145 has served the country quite well			0
' ' this is coming from states where it might be an advantage , but i 'm worried about what it means down the road			0
this is a system that has worked			0
that does n't mean we ca n't talk about changes , but we have to be very careful about any actions we might take			0
' under the current electoral college system , the candidate who wins the popular vote does not necessarily win the election			1
each of the @entity92 's 50 states has a number of electoral votes based on its size - the largest , @entity96 , gets 55 votes while @entity98 has just three			2
in all but two states ( @entity53 and @entity54 ) , the candidate who wins the majority of votes in a state wins that state 's electoral votes			2
the first candidate to reach a majority 270 votes out of 538			0
but @entity8 in @entity14 want a system that works more like that of @entity54 and @entity53 , where electoral votes are allocated by proportional representation			1
it means the candidate with the most votes in those states wins two electoral votes , for its two senators			0
the remaining electoral votes are then assigned by congressional district , meaning candidates can each receive votes from both @entity54 and @entity53 .			1

@entity8 want a bill that would allocate votes by congressional district
they want it to *replace* the current electoral college voting system
@entity14 's @entity8 - controlled @entity13 *tabled* such a bill on wednesday
under such a system , @entity21 would have won the last election
