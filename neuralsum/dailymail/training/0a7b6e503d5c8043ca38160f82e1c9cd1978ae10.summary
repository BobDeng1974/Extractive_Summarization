@entity0 will be given the chance to reignite his international career after being drafted into @entity5 ’s @entity4 squad			1
some wondered whether the 29 - year - old @entity8 playmaker ’s days in the red jersey were over when he was omitted from last month ’s 34 - man squad announcement			1
however , an injury to fly - half @entity12 has created an opening and the 76 - cap utility back will travel across the @entity16 this morning to join the squad in @entity18			1
substitutes : @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53			0
@entity19 : @entity55 @entity54 ; @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 ; @entity60 , @entity61 ; @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 ( captain ) , @entity70			0
substitutes : @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79			0
contractual obligations to @entity8 mean @entity0 will not be available for the fourth test against @entity82 , which falls outside of the test window , but he will be free to play in the next two fixtures , against @entity85 and @entity86			1
@entity5 was forced to bring in reinforcements after @entity12 suffered a groin strain in saturday ’s defeat by @entity19 , leaving @entity52 as the only fit fly - half in the squad			1
@entity0 ’s adaptability means he can also cover at full - back , where @entity4 will be without @entity31 , who is sidelined with concussion			1
the alternative scenario was to fast - track @entity86 convert @entity96 into the squad			1
the 23 - year - old landed in @entity18 last night and is eligible to play for @entity4 through his mother , but he will instead make his debut for @entity101 this weekend			2
‘ @entity96 needs to play some rugby first , ’ said @entity5			1
‘ it would be unfair to bring him in			0
he has to spend some time in the @entity106 camp , experience some @entity106 banter and learn his trade			0
’ @entity4 ' @entity35 runs in the first try of the match in the third minute after a break from @entity42 @entity19 's @entity58 is driven back by @entity35 and @entity44 early on at the @entity112 @entity26 strikes again after an intercept on the @entity19 defensive 22m line and runs the length of the pitch hook is likely to be named on the bench this weekend , with @entity119 @entity34 expected to take @entity31 ’s place at full - back for the second round of fixtures			2
@entity34 was one of @entity4 ’ more impressive players on saturday , despite being deployed in his weaker position on the wing			0
he was unable to prevent @entity4 from suffering a 10th straight defeat by the @entity19 , part of a painfully barren run that has seen @entity5 ’s side lose 21 consecutive fixtures against the ‘ big three ’ of the southern hemisphere			1
it was yet another case of conceding decisive scores at the death for the home side			2
wales were leading with eight minutes to play before @entity19 fly - half @entity60 inevitably kicked six points to snatch victory			0
@entity19 winger @entity56 takes to the air above @entity28 ( left ) @entity28 scores @entity4 ' second try after a rampaging run from @entity32 @entity57 busts through a tackle on the burst and beats @entity33 ( right ) for the @entity27 ' third try wales celebrate their third try through @entity40 in time added on in the first half @entity4 had taken an early lead after a third - minute try from @entity35 , but the scrum - half was among those at fault as a series of cheap mistakes allowed @entity19 back into the game			2
missed tackles from @entity12 , @entity28 and @entity40 proved costly for two of @entity19 ’s three first - half tries , while @entity35 ’s 20 - yard miss - pass gifted @entity163 an interception and he cantered over from 80 metres			1
‘ i was happy with my try but then i gave away a silly interception , ’ said @entity35			0
‘ if it had gone to @entity34 it would have been a different story , but it is one of those things			0
‘ it was there for us , but we have to take the positives			0
’ prop @entity47 started on the bench but his impact in the scrum — where @entity4 won a 64th - minute penalty try after scores from @entity28 and @entity40 — could earn the 126 - cap front row a starting place against @entity85			2
scrum - half @entity60 potted the first penalty attempt of the match early in the second half @entity4 skipper @entity42 leads from the front with a strong run at the @entity27 defensive line wales dominate the @entity27 scrum under the posts for a series of penalties before being given a penalty try @entity60 , chosen ahead of @entity193 , slots a field goal to put @entity19 back in the lead in the second half the @entity196 and the @entity197 share a laugh with other vips in the stands			0
