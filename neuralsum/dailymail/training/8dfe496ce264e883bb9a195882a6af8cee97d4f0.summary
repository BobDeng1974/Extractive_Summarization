by @entity1 reporter published : 23:37 est , 30 august 2013 updated : 23:37 est , 30 august 2013 bottles of @entity3 sold in the @entity4 will soon bear red warnings alerting users to the potentially fatal risks of taking too much of the popular pain reliever.the unusual step , disclosed by the company that makes @entity3 , comes amid a growing number of lawsuits and pressure from the federal government that could have widespread ramifications for a medicine taken by millions of people every @entity18 says the warning will appear on the cap of new bottles of @entity3 sold in the @entity4 starting in october and on most other @entity3 bottles in coming months			1
starting in october @entity3 bottles will have a new warning label on the cap alerting users to potentially fatal risks of taking too much of the pain reliever the warning will make it explicitly clear that the over-the - counter drug contains acetaminophen , a pain - relieving ingredient that 's the nation 's leading cause of sudden liver failure			1
the warning will alert consumers to the presence of acetaminophen in the drug , which is taken in high quantities can lead to liver failure acetaminophen can be found in more than 600 common over-the - counter and prescription products used by nearly one in four @entity4 adults every week , including household brands like @entity48 cold formula , @entity50 pain tablets and @entity52 sinus pills			1
@entity3 is the first of these products to include such a warning label on the bottle cap			2
@entity57 says the warning is a result of research into the misuse of @entity3 by consumers			2
the new cap message will read , ' contains @entity64 ' and ' always read the label			0
' the move comes at a critical time for the company , which faces more than 85 personal injury lawsuits in federal court that blame @entity3 for liver injuries and deaths			2
at the same time , the @entity74 is drafting long - awaited safety proposals that could curtail the use of @entity3 and other acetaminophen products			0
advocates for the warning believe the @entity4 use the pain reliever too casually without really known what it contains much is at stake for @entity57 and its parent company			1
@entity86 does not report sales of @entity3 , but total sales of all over-the - counter medicines containing acetaminophen were more than $ 1.75 billion last year , according to @entity91 , a retail data service			1
safety experts are most concerned about ' extra-strength ' versions of @entity3 and other pain relievers with acetaminophen found in drugstores			2
a typical two - pill dose of @entity3 contains 1,000 milligrams of acetaminophen , compared with 650 milligrams for regular strength			0
@entity3 is so popular that some pharmacies do n't even stock regular strength			0
most experts agree that acetaminophen is safe when used as directed , which generally means taking 4,000 milligrams , or eight pills of @entity3 or less , a day			0
each year , some 100 million @entity4 use acetaminophen , but liver damage occurs in only a fraction of 1 percent of users			0
currently the warning about the acetaminophen dosage in extra strength @entity3 is just on the back of the pill bottles still , liver specialists say those cases are preventable			1
they say that part of the problem is that there are sometimes hundreds of pills in a bottle , making it easy for consumers to pop as many as they please			0
for example , @entity57 sells @entity3 in bottles containing up to 325 tablets ' the argument goes that if you take acetaminophen correctly you will virtually never get into trouble , ' said dr. @entity132 of the @entity133 , who has studied acetaminophen toxicity for four decades			2
' but it 's the very fact that it 's easily accessible over-the - counter in bottles of 300 pills or more that puts people in harm 's way			0
' overdoses from acetaminophen send 55,000 to 80,000 people to the emergency room according the @entity74 @entity132 applauded the new warning , but said @entity57 's marketing has contributed to the ' freewheeling ' way that @entity4 take the drug			0
for decades , @entity57 has advertised @entity3 as ' the safest kind of pain reliever ' when used as directed			1
' that has been their standard ploy in the past , and i would argue that safest it is not , ' he @entity157 's @entity156 stands by the company 's safety claim : ' when taken as directed , when people read and follow the label , i believe that @entity3 and the acetaminophen ingredient is one of the safest pain relievers on the market			1
' @entity57 is the only major drug maker adopting the bottle cap warning at this time , according to the @entity168 , a trade group for over-the - counter medicine companies			0
' while this is not an industry - wide initiative at this time , it fits squarely within the many ongoing industry - wide educational initiatives to further acetaminophen safe and responsible use by consumers , ' said @entity178 , a vice president with the trade group , which represents @entity57 , @entity179 , @entity180 and other nonprescription drug makers .			1

in october @entity86 will put warnings on the top of @entity3 bottles alerting consumers to the presence of acetaminophen
acetaminophen , a pain relieving ingredient , is one of the leading causes of liver failure in the country
drug makers hope that the warning will stop consumers from *accidentally* overdosing on the household pain reliever
