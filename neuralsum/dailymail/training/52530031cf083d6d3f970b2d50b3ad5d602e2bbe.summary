by @entity0 @entity2 manager @entity1 will hold talks with left - back @entity4 after he appeared to raise his hand to referee @entity7 following his dismissal during their 1 - 0 defeat at @entity11			1
@entity4 was sent off on the hour mark after collecting two yellow cards for challenges on the @entity11 winger @entity15			1
@entity1 , whose side were beaten by a 64th - minute header from @entity18 , hopes that @entity4 will not face any further action other than a standard one - match ban			1
flashpoint : @entity4 attempted to stop referee @entity7 producing his red card on the hour mark hopeful : @entity1 said he did n't see the incident but that he was hopeful that @entity4 would avoid a long ban he said : ' i have n't seen it and hopefully there is nothing in it			1
' but we will have a look at it and see what it is and if there are any consequences from that			0
' i will speak to @entity4 about that			1
i did n't see it because as soon as the card comes out you 're looking away to what you are going to do			2
but i will have a look at it			0
' the officials have said nothing to us about any alleged hands on and like i say i have not seen it for now			2
we will get the footage going back on the coach			0
' but there has been nothing said or suggested to me as of yet from that			0
we will need to make inquiries if something has happened			0
' despite making the worst possible start to their bid to make an instant return to the @entity62 , @entity1 refused to be too downcast but admitted that the loss of @entity4 was pivotal			1
in trouble : the @entity2 full - back pulls @entity15 to the ground to pick up his second yellow seeing red : @entity7 eventually manages to get his card out and shows it to the @entity2 man he added : ' the second one was a stronger yellow than the first for me			1
we lost a player at a point where i thought we were controlling the game			1
' we were looking good and pinning @entity11 back and when the red card happens we get caught when we are down to 10 men			1
' there were positives to take from the game but you are never happy when you lose			1
' @entity18 , who had missed an excellent chance after just 22 seconds , made no mistake when he rose unmarked to head home @entity15 's cross			0
it was a just reward for @entity11 who had carried the greater threat all match through @entity15 , @entity95 and @entity96			2
@entity2 were lightweight in attack , their best chance falling to @entity99 in the 54th minute			2
distraught : @entity4 trudges off , kicking a water bottle on his way , after being dismissed turning point : @entity1 said he thought the red card marked a change in momentum , allowing @entity11 to score but he was denied a goal on his debut following his Â£ 3million move from @entity110 by a smart save from @entity111			1
@entity11 manager @entity112 was delighted with his side 's performance on their return to the @entity116 after winning the @entity118 title last season			2
@entity112 said : ' first off it is a good win and a good day for the club			0
' pressure builds up through pre-season and everyone wants to get to that first day and to get a win on the first day is a big thing			0
with us coming into a new division that is great			0
' but looking past that there are different types of challenges			0
you could see the way that @entity2 defended their goal was very good and it was an excellent goal that won the game			1
' it was a late run and a very , very good header into the far corner			0
' there were crucial moments and the sending - off was one			2
that was pivotal as was @entity99 's chance			0
' then @entity18 put that big chance in			0
they were pivotal moments in the game			2

@entity4 sent off for second booking against @entity11
@entity2 go on to lose 1 - 0 , @entity1 says red card was the turning point
defender appeared to touch the referee as he was being dismissed
but officials did not mention incident to @entity2 staff after the game
