@entity0 had been on my wish list for a while - and @entity4 is such a huge fan of @entity5 she once confessed he could be her mastermind subject … nestled in the green rolling hills of the @entity8 , @entity0 is a striking building ; a 15th century manor house built with golden bricks and burgundy roof tiles , and boasting tall chimney stacks and climbing wisteria			1
it is beautiful - and it 's impossible not to gawp			1
the impeccably kept grounds included perfectly trimmed lawns , bronze sculptures ( including a scarecrow based on blanc himself ) , pathways lined with lavender and the walled organic kitchen garden - which supplies the restaurant with seasonal herbs , salads and vegetables			1
@entity29 proudly shows one of the healthy and tasty dishes created at @entity0 aux @entity0 @entity5 pays a surprise visit to the cooking school that bares his name in his @entity36 manor house our twin room for the night was huge			1
we loved it - from the flattering lighting and the textured wallpaper to the cashmere blankets on the end of the beds			2
@entity0 's restaurant has held two @entity47 stars for the best part of the 30 years since it opened			1
we decided to go for the full - on dining experience and the seven - course taster menu			1
each dish was presented like a work of art - it almost seemed a shame to attack it with my cutlery			2
it was so good we were both unusually quiet			0
with every course came a helpful and brief explanation , and a glass of wine			0
the cheese trolley was one of the biggest i 'd seen			0
by this stage i was on mouse - sized portions and ready to pop. the next morning i was woken by the sound of birds rather than the alarm on my phone			0
we headed down to breakfast but were distracted from the huge smorgasbord of choice by @entity5 himself as he bounced around the tables , cheerfully welcoming guests			1
@entity0 boasts stunning grounds , luxury accommodation and @entity5 's two @entity47 - starred restaraunt thankfully , @entity4 was more starstruck than stalker when it was our turn			1
chatty and friendly , @entity5 noticed my @entity86 muesli and immediately offered up the recipe			1
i had signed up to the @entity88 to start promptly at 9am - one of several day - long courses run at the in - house cookery school			1
a few minutes in , @entity5 unexpectedly arrived and introduced the course - passionate , enthusiastic and energetic he spoke about the importance of nutrition and being mindful of the ingredients we choose			1
this was right up my street and i could n't wait to get going			0
@entity99 , a nutritionist , and @entity101 , a chef who has worked with @entity5 for more than 25 years , were brilliant course hosts and teachers			2
with their amazing knowledge , they were like a human foodie @entity107			0
@entity99 banished misleading food myths , while her informative facts and figures on the latest medical research were fascinating			0
i could n't help but scribble down notes			0
food icon @entity5 and @entity29 bond over a delicious creme caramel at his @entity117 cooking school i thought my limited cooking skills would be a hindrance , but far from it			1
@entity101 showed us several easy , healthy dishes - some of which we cooked , wearing our chef whites in our own fully equipped kitchens			0
hands - on @entity127 popped back just as we were making our sugar - free chocolate mousse - and wasted no time in helping out with the frantic whisking			0
trains run from @entity131 to @entity132 ( a 10 - minute drive to the hotel and restaurant ) @entity0 offers a @entity137 break from £ 895 per couple			1
this includes a five - course dinner , three glasses of wine each and one night 's b&b accommodation			2
the @entity144 , body course costs from £ 395pp			0
i loved every minute of it and learned so much - from interesting food facts ( who knew fresh - out - of - the - ground new potatoes were a healthier option than blueberries ? ) to helpful kitchen skills			2
i 've lost count of the times i 've rustled up some of the recipes at home since			0
it had been a massive treat			0
i had asked @entity5 which season was best to visit @entity160			2
he replied : ' you must visit every season ! ' brilliant idea .			0
