@entity1 jets were deployed from @entity2 to intercept @entity4 military ' @entity6 ' aircraft that were flying too close to the airspace it guards			2
aircraft based at @entity10 , based in @entity11 , were sent to identify the aircraft - @entity13 bombers - that were spotted in international airspace			1
it was the first time a @entity18 had occurred since the base took on the role of defending the @entity23 ’s @entity22 airspace			1
he said : ' the relocation of two @entity26 squadrons was a significant challenge , one that was met by our whole team			0
' the many months of preparation and infrastructure improvements have made us absolutely ready for this launch , and shows we are in the best position to provide the service to the @entity23 that the @entity1 was primarily created for - that is , the protection of our airspace			0
' @entity10 began a new era in its history on the 1st of september when it assumed the provision of what the @entity1 calls the ‘ @entity60 ’ task for the @entity23			1
the role is carried out by crews from @entity63			0
the pilot involved in the mission called it a ' flawless scramble and execution ' and said it was a milestone moment for @entity10 the pilot of the first launch , who has not been named , said ' it was an honour ' to be part of the first alert , something he called a ' milestone in the history of @entity10 '			1
he added : ' the fact that we had a flawless scramble and intercept of two @entity4 bears was a testament to the hard work and commitment of all personnel involved			1
' a very proud moment , not just for the pilots who did the intercept but the engineering crews who did a fantastic job , as well as many other station personnel involved in this constant commitment			1
' in june two @entity26 jets were scrambled into action to head off four separate groups of @entity4 aircraft that were flying near the @entity98			0
the jets were deployed to ensure the @entity4 planes did n't enter the airspace of @entity102 , @entity103 or @entity104			0
the @entity105 said the aircraft appeared to be carrying out a ' routine training ' exercise in international airspace and were later escorted out of the area			0
that incident followed another where four @entity112 were sent to the @entity114 air base in @entity103 in may to support a @entity117 - led @entity116 force which was operating in the region			2

and said it was a ' milestone ' for the base and a ' very proud moment '
