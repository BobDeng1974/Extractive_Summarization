eavesdrop on @entity1 cricket all - rounder @entity2 and you might jump to the wrong conclusion if he uses the words ‘ length ’ and ‘ poundage ’			1
he is not necessarily talking about where he pitches the off - breaks that made him a valuable contributor in last summer ’s @entity11 , or the weight of his new bat			1
the 32 - year - old is just as likely to be explaining his analysis of an afternoon ’s runners			1
a new three - year deal has just been signed with his county but @entity2 is planning for a longer - term future which he hopes will be played out on a different form of turf			1
@entity1 cricket all - rounder @entity2 says he has been hooked on racing since he was five - years - old @entity2 said he would like to go into racing punditry when he finishes playing cricket in six or seven years time @entity24 ( left ) talks to @entity27 's @entity26 ( right ) at @entity28 1 @entity29 : quite simply , wins the @entity30 at the @entity31 by 10 lengths ! 2 @entity33 : wins the @entity34 by five lengths ! 3 @entity36 : fell in last season ’s @entity38 but had previously beaten first and third @entity41 and @entity42 at @entity43 , giving them weight			1
4 capote : soft ground staying chaser who should prove better than his hurdling form			2
5 @entity48 : very well handicapped for steeplechasing and goes well fresh			2
6 champagne at @entity51 : will prove better upped in trip and nicely handicapped			2
7 @entity53 : highly rated by @entity55 trainer @entity54			0
soft ground will suit him well			0
8 many clouds : can win a high - class handicap chase between 2m4f - 3m			1
9 golden chieftain : ran well on reappearance at @entity31			0
runs in @entity62 at @entity63 this afternoon			1
10 @entity64 : looks suited to the @entity66			0
on wednesday he was the studio expert for subscription channel @entity68 , interpreting the action from @entity71 and @entity72			0
during the winter months , @entity2 can also be found offering useful advice to punters via @entity76 radio			1
@entity2 has scored more than 7,000 first - class runs , won four @entity79 medals ( three with @entity80 and one with @entity81 ) and was a member of the @entity1 team which won this year ’s @entity84 to gain promotion			1
but he has an equal passion for horseracing			0
he said : ‘ my father used to take me and my older brother to @entity90 every @entity91 and @entity92 monday			0
i loved everything about a racecourse , the atmosphere , the smells			0
i was five or six and it got me hooked			2
‘ throughout my teenage years i always studied the form in the hope of making a pound or two			2
i have always had an analytical mind so i enjoyed that side of it			0
‘ two winters ago , i was coming into the last year of my contract with @entity80			0
it was up in the air whether i would get another deal because of their financial troubles			0
‘ i thought i might have to do something else so i thought “ what do i have a passion for ? ” ’ the cricketer , who captained @entity80 as they retained their title in the 2009 season , said : ‘ i pestered the ( @entity119 ) producer with emails and did n’t let him have a moment ’s peace because i was so keen			0
i love doing the punditry			2
it is ideally where i would like to be once the cricket finishes even if , hopefully , that is another six or seven years down the line			1
’ @entity2 revealed that in 2009 he was unsure whether he would get a new @entity80 contract so was f @entity2 has scored more than 7,000 first - class runs and has won four @entity79 medals @entity2 captained current @entity132 skipper @entity131 when the two were at @entity134 together @entity2 , who took three for 15 when a losing semi-finalist in the @entity11 finals in august , has a cricket pedigree as rich as some of the racehorses he analyses			1
his fielding skills earned him a stint as a substitute fielder for @entity132 while on the @entity144 staff and , prior to playing for @entity146 universities , he captained current @entity132 skipper @entity131 while they were contemporaries at @entity134			0
@entity2 said : ‘ he was 4ft 2in and i do n’t think his voice had broken but you could tell he had a bit of talent			1
i was no 3 and @entity131 opened with @entity152 , who went on to play hockey for @entity132			0
‘ they put on numerous double hundred partnerships so i spent a lot of my time with my pads on not doing a lot			0
’ @entity2 , married to @entity160 with two daughters , @entity162 , three , and @entity163 , six months , believes his interest in racing acts as a useful diversion from the demands of the county circuit			1
he said : ‘ if you are just watching the cricket you become a little too intense about it , or i do anyway			2
also at night time you just want to switch off			0
‘ i go out for a meal with team - mates and then can sit back and watch the racing i have missed and catch up on the form			1
’ another result at @entity1 suggests @entity2 has not given his team - mates too many losing tips — he was voted players ’ @entity179 for 2014 .			1
