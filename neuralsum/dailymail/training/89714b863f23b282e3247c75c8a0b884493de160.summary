when @entity1 followed @entity2 in leaving the captain 's armband at @entity5 behind to join @entity6 , there were suggestions that the @entity8 had become a feeder club			1
poaching @entity11 's biggest stars has become somewhat of a trait at the @entity13 , with @entity8 fans wary of speculation every summer linking a star man with a move to @entity18			2
but has it been all bad ? @entity6 have splashed a staggering £ 123million on @entity5 players , most recently signing @entity21 - now out for up to five months - for £ 15m			1
when @entity1 left @entity5 to join @entity6 , there were suggestions the @entity8 were a feeder club but @entity24 has hit the ground running following his £ 30m move to the @entity27 @entity21 cost @entity6 £ 15m but has yet to feature and could be out for up to five months @entity1 £ 31m @entity21 £ 15m @entity28 £ 15m @entity29 £ 12m @entity2 £ 16m @entity30 £ 2m @entity31 £ 25m @entity32 £ 7m total : 123m couple that with the instant impact of @entity24 in north @entity35 following his move from the @entity38 giants , and @entity5 look to be coming up trumps			1
in fact , @entity6 's transfer fees sent over to @entity5 cover almost a third of the cost of the @entity44 , £ 390m			1
it all started in the summer of 2000 , with @entity6 poaching full internationals @entity31 and @entity32 for a combined price of £ 32m			2
at 27 and 29 , @entity11 may have thought the duo 's best years were behind them			0
that proved to be the case			0
@entity52 played 97 times in four seasons but found regular starting opportunities limited , with the fans getting on his case too , while @entity59 midfielder @entity32 stayed for just one season before joining @entity61			0
@entity6 's transfer fees to @entity5 almost make up a third of the cost of the @entity44 @entity64 left @entity5 for £ 25m but was never a star at @entity6 @entity32 left at the same time as @entity52 but only stayed for a year before joining @entity61 @entity29 could never fit in during his time with the @entity38 giants @entity69 publication sport splash on @entity21 the timing of these sales by @entity11 can usually be commended			1
@entity29 split opinion at the @entity44 before struggling at @entity6 following an £ 12m move , as did @entity28 despite a fine final season			1
the @entity76 midfielder , worth £ 15m two summers ago , is now rebuilding his shattered reputation back in the @entity27 with @entity79			1
@entity2 , sold at 29 , and @entity1 had similar difficulties fitting in around a team of superstars under @entity83			1
the midfielder , poached from the @entity86 academy as a teen by @entity5 , has recently admitted he is ' enjoying his football again ' with @entity61 having toiled at @entity6			2
the £ 31m the @entity8 received was considered to be short change at the time			0
still , @entity5 's reputation of supplying @entity6 with some of their finest players was in tact			2
but now , even the local press are condemning the board 's actions in @entity69			0
@entity97 as the poster boy when insisting @entity6 have ' wasted their money on @entity5 players '			2
@entity21 's lengthy lay off has also added strength to these accusations			0
but it 's the form of @entity24 that has seen a change in tide			0
@entity2 was sold at 29 for £ 16m , and never quite hit his top form again @entity11 chats to @entity1 on the training pitch before the midfielder 's move to his hometown club @entity5 are now competing with the very best , and have signed a genuine world class talent in @entity24 the @entity113 was frozen out at the @entity13			1
not content with waiting around in the wings any longer , the 25 - year - old seeked a move to the most competitive league in the world , and has hit the ground running despite his £ 30m price tag			0
eight goals in 10 @entity27 games , 13 strikes in all competitions , the quality @entity24 is bringing forward at present is head and shoulders above the rest of his team			1
there is a feeling around @entity5 that for the first time the club have purchased a genuine superstar , one of the best in the world			0
and it just so happens they brought him in from ' parent club ' @entity141 would have thought it ? @entity143 here to like our @entity145 page .			0
