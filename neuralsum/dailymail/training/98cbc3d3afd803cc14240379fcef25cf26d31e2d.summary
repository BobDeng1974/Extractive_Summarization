by @entity0 feckless absent fathers should be put to work ‘ in chains ’ to repay the @entity3 for the cost of bringing up their children , a @entity1 mp said yesterday			1
@entity8 told @entity9 that it was ‘ outrageous ’ that some young men got women pregnant before leaving them to bring up their babies on their own on benefits			1
he made his demand in a @entity17 debate in which @entity18 launched more attacks on the government ’s attempt to cut the vast housing benefit bill			1
outspoken : @entity1 mp @entity8 said feckless fathers should be locked in chains and made to work to pay for the children they abandoned labour work and pensions spokesman @entity27 , calling for a vote on the @entity31 ’s reform of the spare room subsidy – branded the ‘ bedroom tax ’ by @entity18 – said vulnerable people were being unfairly targeted			1
but mr @entity8 , the mp for @entity35 , said he had met a woman bringing up four grandchildren and that the children ’s mother was going to lose out on housing benefit because she was not their main carer			1
mr @entity8 said the women essentially wanted ‘ two large houses ’ in which to look after the same children			1
‘ i think it is absolutely outrageous that so many young men in our society feel they can go out , get women pregnant , allow them to have children , make them bring them up by themselves , very often on benefits , and then disappear , ’ he said			1
‘ i hope that the ministers will take note of this and get hold of some of these feckless fathers , drag them off , make them work , put them in chains if necessary , make them work and make them pay back society for the cost of bringing up the children they chose to bring into this world			1
’ @entity62 , the @entity63 spokesman for @entity18 , said the reform was ‘ beyond disgrace ’ and revealed his brother , who has kidney failure , faces losing his home of 20 years			2
miss @entity27 said a @entity18 government would scrap the reform			2
‘ if i am secretary of state in 2015 this will be the first thing i will do – reverse this unfair and pernicious tax , ’ she said			2
she criticised work and pensions secretary @entity73 for missing the debate to attend a conference in @entity76 on youth employment			2
@entity78 , who is definitely not @entity8 @entity8 is probably best known for not being @entity78			2
the @entity80 politician is frequently confused with his near - namesake ( inset ) , who lost out to @entity83 for the @entity1 leadership in 2005			0
as a result he uses his middle initials @entity87 in @entity88 , earning the nickname ‘ @entity90 ’			0
mr @entity8 , the @entity35 mp , has never reached the @entity1 frontline , at odds with the leadership on many issues			1
the fluent welsh - speaking was born in @entity96 and grew up in @entity97 , working for @entity98 and the @entity99 before travelling around @entity100 where he picked tobacco and ran a nightclub			0
he ran a campaign against the @entity104 being set up , but then stood for election to it and became the only @entity1 to win a constituency seat			0
the special constable was elected as mp for @entity35 in 2005 , and has called for @entity109 to leave the @entity110 , expressed doubts about climate change and argued people who come to @entity109 should learn @entity114 and be fit to work			1
in 2010 he accused the @entity18 of trying to smear him as a ‘ @entity115 ’			0
last year he insisted he is not homophobic – because he once fought a gay boxer with the nickname the @entity118			0
he had claimed that parents hoped for heterosexual children because they wanted grandchildren			2
but mr @entity73 , writing on the @entity124 website , said : ‘ we ’ve ended the thoroughly unfair subsidy that saw the taxpayer forking out for almost one million spare bedrooms in the social rented sector			0
’ he said that 54 per cent of the public agreed that people of working age who lived in social housing should receive less housing benefit if they had more bedrooms than they needed			0
under the reform , working - age claimants with extra bedrooms are having their housing benefit cut by 14 per cent for the first excess bedroom and 25 per cent for two or more bedrooms			0
pensioners are protected and those who can not move or can not afford the extra cost can apply for discretionary payments			0
the government estimates the reform will cost the average affected household £ 14 a week , saving £ 500million a year .			0

@entity35 mp says men who father children should pay for *upbringing*
he tells the *commons* the state should not be left to pick up the bill
also *condemns* *over-generous* benefits which pay for ' **teenage** love nests '
he says he used to meet his **teenage** *girlfriend* ' on a park bench '
