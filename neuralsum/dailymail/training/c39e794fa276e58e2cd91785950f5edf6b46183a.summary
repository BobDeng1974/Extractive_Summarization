by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor @entity2 was today forced to deny @entity4 ’s new election campaign is racist , as it emerged a woman posing as a voter in the party ’s manifesto works for him			1
@entity10 appears in a full - page photograph as a voter from @entity13 , but is actually @entity4 ’s events manager and an assistant to the party leader			1
mr @entity2 claimed the fact that miss @entity10 is ‘ half - @entity23 and works for us ’ is a non-issue , as the party became embroiled in a row about a series of provocative anti-immigration posters			1
it includes a controversial £ 1.5million poster campaign which urges voters : ‘ take back control of our country			1
’ the 2014 @entity4 manifesto – titled ‘ create an earthquake ’ – declares : ‘ we want our country back			1
do n’t you ? ’ it features a full - page picture of @entity50 , with a large quote stating : ‘ i ’ll be voting @entity4 because they ’re the only party listening to what people want			1
’ however , she works in @entity57 and on her @entity59 account she describes herself as ‘ @entity60 and assistant to @entity2 , as well as a lover of social occasions ’			1
it also emerged that @entity50 appeared on another leaflet earlier this year aimed at voters in the @entity67 by - election			2
embarrassingly , only last week she tweeted a link to a story about @entity72 ‘ distributing false leaflets about @entity4 ’			1
controversial : @entity4 's new posters are being funded by £ 1.5m of funding from millionaire @entity77 donor @entity75 to launch its biggest ever publicity drive ahead of the @entity37 elections in may adverts : under the slogan ' take back control of our country ' , the party complain that 75 per cent of @entity86 laws are made in @entity87 and that @entity86 taxpayers fund the ' celebrity lifestyle ' of @entity91 bureaucrats mr @entity2 faced difficult questions about the apparent attempt to use a member of @entity4 staff to pose as a voter			1
‘ i do n’t think you ’d ask this question of the @entity72 , the @entity100 or the @entity101 who often have group pictures , ’ he told @entity97			0
‘ you know , the leader with 25 people standing behind them			0
and you never ask to see the cv of any of those			0
’ he went on : ‘ the fact that @entity110 is half - @entity23 and works for us is as far as we are concerned a non-issue			1
‘ she is somebody in our promotional material who is going to vote @entity4			2
she joined @entity4 , she got a job with @entity4 because she believes in what we stand for			2
what on earth is wrong with that ? ’ @entity4 leader @entity2 was put on the spot today about whether his @entity124 wife had taken a job which could have gone to a @entity126			1
@entity128 political editor @entity127 challenged him to explain why he employed @entity129 as a secretary on a taxpayer - funded salary from @entity87			0
mr @entity2 insisted that ' nobody else could do that job ' , which included checking emails for him at midnight			2
‘ she came here as a highly skilled person earning a high salary paying a very large amount of tax , ’ the @entity60 leader insisted			0
‘ i do n’t think anybody else would want to be in my house at midnight going through emails and getting me briefed for the next day			0
it ’s a very different situation to a mass of hundreds of thousands of people coming in and flooding the lower end of the labour market			0
’ asked whether a @entity86 person could take the position as his secretary , mr @entity2 insisted : ‘ nobody else could do that job , not unless they were married to me			1
’ mr @entity2 said his wife earned a ‘ very modest ’ wage and worked ‘ extremely unsociable hours ’ for ‘ up to ’ seven days a week			1
@entity4 leader @entity2 contrasted the dinner at @entity157 with his own trip to @entity38 today to launch his controversial posters mr @entity2 told @entity1 voters on may 22 could deliver a ' severe shock and maybe even a political earthquake ' @entity163 is hosting arch - eurocrat @entity164 for dinner at @entity157 tonight , just weeks before crucial @entity168 elections			1
the @entity101 leader will dine with the president of the @entity171 , who is also due to stay the night at the prime minister ’s official rural retreat			0
@entity2 said the timing of mr @entity163 ’s intimate meal with the @entity87 bureaucrat ‘ could not be better ’ as @entity4 prepared to unveil a £ 1.5million poster campaign attacking immigration from the @entity91			1
the prime minister 's official spokesman said : ' this is one of a number of meetings that president @entity164 is having with heads of government around @entity168			0
' it is an opporunity to talk around the future direction of the next @entity190 and @entity91 reform priorities			0
' also i am sure they will discuss the latest on the situation in @entity194			0
it is a working dinner			0
' the spokesman confirmed mr @entity164 would also be staying the night : ' if someone is coming for dinner in the evening , it is polite to ask them to stay the night			0
' however , he refused to be drawn on whether he would be served a continental breakfast tomorrow morning			0
asked why miss @entity10 is not described as a @entity4 staff member in the manifesto , mr @entity2 replied : ‘ i do n’t see the need			1
you ’re going down this media route , do you want us to say the religion of all our candidates ? ‘ or do you want us to say we are living in the @entity86 , wherever we come from , whatever religion we are , we are part of this country and we are all in this together			2
you seem to be wanting to segment people out			0
‘ i ca n't really win with you , can i ? on the one hand you 're saying that we are talking about a white working class in @entity86 , and secondly , when i tell you that working directly for me is a girl who is half - @entity23 , you 've got a problem with that too ? just make your mind up			1
i do n't mind being criticised , but do make your mind up what the criticism is ... ’ the interview with @entity97 presenter @entity226 divided opinion , with many viewers complain that it had been unfair on mr @entity2			2
mr @entity2 also denied the new poster campaign is racist			2
the party has paid for billboards across the country to be emblazoned with messages such as : ‘ 26million people in @entity168 are looking for work			0
and whose jobs are they after ? ’ another has a picture of a construction worker begging on the street , with the slogan : ‘ @entity91 policy at work			0
@entity86 workers are hit hard by unlimited cheap labour			1
’ ‘ it is the job of the @entity86 government firstly to defend the realm , and secondly to put the interests of the people that live in this country first			1
‘ that 's what we should be doing , and i 'm afraid we 've turned our backs on that over the course of the last few years which has led to much , much unhappiness among millions of families			0
’ he told @entity262 : ‘ the @entity264 political elite have opened up our borders to levels of immigration @entity86 's never seen and they decry anybody that wants to talk about it as racist			2
‘ they 've done it for years			0
they 've tried to sweep this whole issue under the carpet and we 're talking about it openly and honestly			0
’ all the posters call on voters to ‘ @entity279 ’ by backing @entity4 in the @entity168 elections			1
@entity101 mp @entity282 , the grandson of sir @entity283 , wrote on @entity59 : ‘ at a time when our country really needs to come together , the @entity4 advertising campaign is deeply divisive , offensive and ignorant			2
’ @entity72 frontbencher @entity288 said : ‘ @entity60 would have us believe they stand for working people but the truth is very different - they 're even more right wing than the @entity292			2
‘ a vote for @entity60 is a vote for higher taxes for working families , charges to see your gp , huge tax giveaways for the rich and even deeper cuts to public services			0
only @entity72 can make @entity86 better off			0
’ senior @entity100 peer @entity304 said the posters were ‘ extreme even by the standards of the @entity308 ’ , the @entity303 far right party mr @entity2 has tried to distance @entity4 from .			1
