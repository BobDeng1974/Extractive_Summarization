by @entity1 reporter published : 10:35 est , 22 june 2013 updated : 10:35 est , 22 june 2013 a @entity2 : the book about exhibits in the @entity5 which explore homosexual desire has been published in time for @entity7 the @entity8 has released a new guide to exhibits in its collection which explore ideas of same - sex love and eroticism			1
a @entity2 , written by curator @entity16 , draws on objects ranging from ancient @entity19 papyrii containing gay chat up lines to @entity23 woodcuts depicting men having sex			1
it is accompanied by an audio trail featuring actor @entity27 and artist @entity28 , with the publication timed to coincide with this year 's @entity7 festival			1
both explore artistic portrayals of homoeroticism throughout the ages , with the book making special discussion of the difficulties in finding the often suppressed records of homosexuality			1
' history has all too often been a list of the deeds of famous men who are implicitly ' heterosexual ' and usually @entity44 , ' he writes			1
' unsurprisingly , lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender people have often felt excluded and silenced , and without a voice			2
' nevertheless , he notes that museum collections full of classical artwork - from an era more comfortable with the idea of homosexual sex and , indeed , the naked human form in general - have been ' important spaces for people to consider their own sexual identity '			2
' most museums have collections of @entity62 and @entity63 statues which show men looking very naked , ' he explains , ' so for men who desired other men it was one of the few spaces where they could look at naked male bodies in a culturally respectable sort of way			0
' mr @entity16 , whose speciality is @entity74 , claims the oldest recorded chat up line can be found in his department - and it involves a pair of men			1
it is contained in a poem from @entity82 in which one male @entity19 god makes a pass at another , saying ' neferwi - pehwi - ki ' , which translates as : ' what a lovely backside you have			1
' many of the objects highlighted in a @entity2 are drawn from classical antiquity			0
there is the sculpture of the face of the @entity96 , at whose death @entity99 is said to have ' wept like a woman '			0
after @entity103 ' death in @entity104 from drowning in the @entity105 , the emperor proclaimed him a @entity106 and spread his image across the empire			0
yet such is the squeamishness with which historians have regarded homosexual love , a visitor survey carried for the museum at a major exhibition in 2008 found that only a handful of people knew he was openly gay			2
' he commemorated @entity96 in statues , religious cults and coins across the @entity122 , ' writes mr @entity16			1
' it is said to be the most passionate outpouring of grief for lost love that we know of before @entity128 and @entity129			0
' openly gay : a marble bust of @entity99 , roman emperor between @entity135 and @entity136 , next to his lover @entity103 , adorned with a wreath like a god , at whose death in @entity104 he is recorded as ' weeping like a woman ' elsewhere he highlights a battered copper coin showing the image of the poet @entity143 , whose homoerotic poetry was so intense that today all gay women are named after the residents of her native lesbos			2
and from the same era , he singles out the @entity150 cup , a @entity63 goblet emblazoned with scenes of men and youths having sex			0
that artefact was previously owned by the @entity158 art collector @entity150 who called it the ' holy grail '			0
taboo : a close up of the @entity163 , which shows scenes of gay sex between men and youths graphic : a @entity23 woodcut depicts two men having sex , one dressed as a woman for a role in kabuki theatre from further afield , there is an 18th century treasure chest from @entity176 designed to be suspended so that its intricate carvings representing , among other things , oral sex could be admired from all sides			2
the @entity23 are represented by a woodblock print that shows two men making love , with one dressed as a woman in his costume as an actor in kabuki theatre			0
mr @entity16 writes : ' people often think that gay and lesbian history is a minority history , but of course it is part of humanity 's history			1
sexual diversity is something that affects us all			0
' the @entity198 will take place next saturday , june 29 , in central @entity200 .			0

publication of a @entity204 history has been timed to coincide with this year 's @entity7 festival
written by curator @entity16 , it explores portrayals of homoeroticism throughout the ages
one @entity19 papyrus contains what mr @entity16 believes to be the oldest known example of a gay chat up line
