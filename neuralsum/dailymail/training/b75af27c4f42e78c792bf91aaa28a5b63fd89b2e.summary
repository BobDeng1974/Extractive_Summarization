by @entity0 the father of @entity3 whistleblower @entity2 has spoken out about how the @entity4 urged him to go to @entity5 to speak with his son			1
@entity7 , a former @entity9 @entity8 , said in interview with the @entity11 , he asked to speak with his son but the @entity4 told him it was n't possible			1
instead they asked him to visit his son in @entity5			0
speaking to @entity11 reporter @entity14 , the supportive father said : ' i was asked if i would consider flying to @entity5			0
and i said " yes , but however , i want to know what the objective is and i want to be able to speak to my son to see if there is value , because i 'm not going to fly to @entity5 to sit on the tarmac to be an emotional tool for you , for the government "			2
he plans to seek asylum in @entity34 and has spoken of wanting to make a permanent home in exile in @entity38			2
in an hour - long interview , the father backed his son 's position and described him as ' wholesome ' and patriotic '			1

' i have never known him to be cruel or harsh with anyone at any time , ' he said			0
@entity2 remains holed up in the transit area of a @entity5 airport , awaiting documents so he can be granted a temporary visa to stay in @entity34 @entity53 began working in intelligence in 2003 , he told the reporter , under the @entity57 administration ; he saw how things evolved , he told the reporter			2
with the arrival of the @entity62 administration he hoped that things would change , but @entity64 said rather than getting better , things got worse			0
since leaking the @entity66 to @entity67 , @entity53 has been trapped in the transit area of @entity5 's @entity69 , unable to travel and seek asylum elsewhere because the @entity9 revoked his passport			2
