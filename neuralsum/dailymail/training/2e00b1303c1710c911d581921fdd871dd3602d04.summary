you have to watch yourself more these days , ’ the unnamed woman told the @entity41			0
in the early 1960s , @entity14 had been home to the family of @entity3 - then @entity3 - and she spent the first two years of her life living there before her family moved in 1965			2
in a 2009 interview with @entity86 , she recalled her childhood memories of the complex as ‘ a wonderful , small apartment building … but now when i pass it , it ’s - i was , like , @entity92 , i never saw that apartment in the way that i ’m seeing it now			1

’ the first lady recalls how the apartment complex was ‘ a wonderful , small apartment building ' but said when she passed the area in recent years if felt very different to how it was in the mid- 1960s as rival gangs have taken over the once thriving area fortunately statics show that a change in policing in the area , suggested by a @entity125 sociologist who ’s studied crime in @entity2 , may be having an impact and the number of shootings is down			1

strategies were also put in place to help identify potential troublemakers , while special attention was also paid to monitoring social media for threats between gang members			0
in the 20 months prior to the ' impact zone ' strategy there were 32 shootings , while in the first 20 months since then there have only been 10 shootings			0
a clear sign of progress according to @entity157 ( 20th ) , a former police sergeant whose ward includes @entity15			0
