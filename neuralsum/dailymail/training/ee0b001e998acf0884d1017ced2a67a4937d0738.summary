a new diet app will allow users to connect with a nutrition expert at the click of a button			1
@entity6 - based @entity5 , which is expected to launch in spring 2015 , rejects traditional calorie - counting , and instead gives users a nutrition score when they log each meal			1
the idea is that users are more likely to successfully lose weight and improve overall health with a scoring system based on customized food group goals than by watching calorie intake			0
ms @entity24 , who also has a phd in mechanical engineering , was inspired to create @entity5 in 2013 after her own struggles with a nutrition - related illness			1
' i knew what i needed to do , ' she told @entity38			0
' i had a great care team , i was motivated , yet my stressful , busy life kept me going back to my old , comfortable , destructive habits			0
' i found that i was more successful when i had regular check - ins with my dietitian , however i needed more support during my everyday life			1
' ms @entity24 says in a company press release that simple dieting and calorie counting approaches fail 95 per cent of the time and current solutions for weight loss and management do n't incorporate a nutrition expert even though research shows they they are proven to be an asset when trying to alter bad food habits			1
that 's not all : the app provides users with food tracking logs , customized feedback , quality of life monitoring , automatic physical activity tracking and a ' smart ' grocery shopping adviser with personalized meal planning , recipes and coupons			2
' each person has unique nutrient needs for optimal health so we developed a nutrition scoring algorithm , personalized to each individual 's daily needs , ' she explains			0
simple solution : founder and ceo @entity24 's personal nutrition struggles inspired her to create @entity5 ' we then use behavior change methodologies to deliver targeted feedback , recommendations and support to help people improve their @entity22 , their quality of life and ultimately their physical health			1
' after logging in their meals , users are given automatic feedback and reminders on how to improve their @entity22 , which is rated from 0 - 100 throughout the day			0
@entity5 will be free for users to download , but features including video counseling sessions with an expert will require a monthly subscription , though fees are yet to be announced			1
if users are struggling between options or tempted to binge , they can click a ' @entity105 ' button , which puts customers in touch with either their current dietitian or one of the network 's experts ( chosen based on location , health insurance carrier and needs )			2
while you are n't required to seek the advice of an expert , @entity5 encourages customers to utilize human interaction as a way to identify and eradicate negative eating patterns			2
according the @entity5 website , the average person makes more than 200 food - related decisions a day , which can make healthy eating seem overwhelming at times			0
@entity5 also offers text and video counseling , quality of life monitoring , automatic physical activity tracking and a ' smart ' grocery shopping adviser with personalized meal planning , recipes and coupons			0
the startup , which is currently in beta , launched a crowdfunding campaign in late november on @entity136 with a goal of raising $ 50,000 by january 13 in order to enhance the product and grow its network of nutrition experts .			0

@entity5 founder @entity24 was inspired to create the app because she found it easier to kick bad habits when she was working with her dietitian
the app is free to download , but users will have to pay a monthly subscription fee to access nutritionist services
