by @entity0 in his press conference yesterday , president @entity1 said that there was ' overwhelming evidence ' @entity6 president @entity5 carried out a chemical weapons attack against rebels in the suburbs of @entity10 on august 21			1
what he did n't mention was that his administration knew about the alleged nerve - gas attack three days before it happened			1
at a @entity16 intelligence briefing friday afternoon , senior administration officials disclosed that there were indications three days prior that an attack was coming			1
advanced notice : according to a report released friday , the @entity16 received signals that the @entity6 military was about to carry out a chemical weapons attack on august 21 , three days before it happened ready : president @entity1 announced in a press conference yesterday that he had enough evidence to justify a military strike against @entity6			1
what he did n't mention is how intelligence officials knew about the attack before it happened ' in the three days prior to the attack , we collected streams of human , signals and geospatial intelligence that reveal regime activities that we assess were association with preparations for a chemical weapons attack , ' the @entity16 intelligence report released by the @entity1 administration said			1
at the briefing , officials would not answer of whether or not they warned rebel forced before the attack			2
but at least two opposition members told @entity48 that they had no idea the attack was coming			2
@entity50 is a @entity6 activist and secure - communications expert living in the @entity16 he says his opposition contacts in @entity6 had no warning before the chemical weapons attack			1
' if you knew , why did you take no action ? ' @entity50 asked			0
@entity57 , another opposition member who lives in one of the towns affected , said she too knew nothing about the oncoming attack			2
' it 's unbelievable that they did nothing to warn people to stop the regime before the crime , ' she said			0
questions : members of the @entity6 opposition questioned why the @entity16 did n't warn them an attack was coming if they knew about it three days before it happened the @entity16 intelligence report concluding that the @entity5 regime had used chemical weapons against it 's own people on august 21 was based on ' a substantial body of information ' including satellite imagery , intercepted communications and social media reports around the time of the attack			1
' our high confidence assessment is the strongest position that the @entity87 can take short of confirmation , ' the report said			0
' we will continue to seek additional information to close gaps in our understanding of what took place			0
' one of those gaps seems to be whether the order was executed at a high level within the @entity6 military , or if it was carried out by a rogue military officer			1
one of the reports confirming the attack happened came from a phone call intercepted by the @entity16 between a panicked @entity6 minister of defense and the leader of a chemical weapons unit			1
the minster was demanding answers for the strike which could be evidence that it was n't directly orderd by president @entity5			0
nevertheless , in his speech yesterday , president @entity1 said he is holding president @entity5 responsible			0
the @entity16 has determined that 1,429 people were killed in the chemical weapons attack on a suburb of @entity10 on august 21			1
the chemicals weapons used a nerve - gas agent which caused it 's victims to asphyxiate			1
@entity117 says that 426 children were among the attack 's victims			1
innocents : according to @entity16 estimates , of the 1,429 killed in the attack , 426 were children an assessment conducted by @entity127 intelligence estimates a much lower death toll of 350 people			1
but president @entity1 and secretary of state @entity130 are confident that the attack happened and that any military action in the country wo n't be like the 2003 invasion of @entity134 for so - called ' weapons of mass destruction			2
' ' we will not repeat that moment , ' secretary @entity130 said			0
which is why president @entity1 announced yesterday that the @entity16 ' should take military action ' even before @entity141 inspectors have finished their investigation			2
weapons inspectors left @entity6 yesterday and now need at least 10 to 14 days to analyze samples they took from the attack site to verify if nerve gas was used			1
' redundant ' : the @entity141 high representative for disarmament affairs negotiated with president @entity5 to let weapons inspectors into the country last week			0
they now need 10 to 14 days to analyze the samples they collected the @entity156 has called this investigation ' redundant ' so president @entity1 has set up the military strike , pending approval from @entity160			2
it 's still uncertain whether or not @entity160 will support the strikes and there is a chance that they will vote against the strikes as the @entity127 's @entity166 did last week			0
whether or not @entity160 approves the strikes , they will no longer come as a surprise to president @entity5 who has been given time to build up his defenses			0
' this is one worry that we have			0
@entity179 the international community has begun talking about a response to the chemical massacre , what we have noticed is that the @entity5 regime has started moving different military units into different areas , ' @entity175 , media director of the @entity176 told @entity48			2
' so they 're using that time to hide their more well - armed units			0
and you know , when they move them to schools , the @entity16 and the international community ca n't do a whole lot about that			0
' pending approval : president @entity1 said he would wait to get authorization from @entity160 before carrying out any strike			0
he was pictured speaking on the phone to speaker of the house @entity199 yesterday			0
