cash - strapped hospital chiefs are spending vast amounts on sending mental health patients into private care after they axed more than 1,000 @entity5 beds - to save money			1
damning figures compiled by @entity8 show the soaring amount paid to private firms to provide ' out - of - area ' beds , which have to be used if publicly - funded beds run out			1
these beds can be up to hundreds of miles from patients ' homes and cost the taxpayer thousands of pounds , but have been used increasingly as @entity5 mental health wards are cut back			1
despair : damning figures show the soaring amount paid to private firms for ' out - of - area ' mental health beds , used when @entity5 beds run out			1
the cost to the taxpayer has more than doubled in just two years ( file photo ) figures provided by 22 mental health trusts show they spent £ 38.2million on private sector out - of - area beds in 2013/14 - two and a half times the £ 14.7million they spent in 2011/12			1
those same trusts cut back their own acute mental health beds – the ones used for serious breakdowns and psychotic episodes - by 6.1 per cent over the same period , from 4,332 to 4,066			1
the figures , released to @entity8 under the @entity41 , prompted outrage from leading mental health charities and @entity45 's shadow public health minister			1
@entity46 , chief executive of @entity47 , said : ' sending people away from home for treatment , while cutting beds in local mental health wards , makes no sense financially and causes human misery			1
' not only is this a bad use of vital @entity5 resources , it is also very distressing for people because it delays them from getting treatment and cuts them off from their family and friends			1
' everyone who needs a hospital bed should be able to get one close to home , no matter where they live or what their circumstances are			0
' counting the cost : each line shows one @entity5 trust which responded to @entity8 , and how much it spent on private out - of - area beds for mental health patients in the past three years			1
largest increases are highlighted mind policy chief @entity75 said the figures suggested bed cuts - which hospitals justify as modernising out - of - date wards and providing more private rooms - were ' short - sighted '			1
' historical underfunding , compounded by cuts over three consecutive years , have left mental health services close to breaking point at a time when more and more people need support			1
' we are very concerned that people are not getting the help they need when in crisis , especially given reports of falling numbers of beds and increasing numbers of people being sent miles across the country to receive care			2
' isolated : @entity100 was just 14 when she was sent to a mental health ward 30 miles from her home one victim was 17 - year - old @entity100			2
she started to hear voices and self - harm when she was just 14 and was later diagnosed with depression and a borderline personality disorder			0
but there were not the right beds available in her local hospital in @entity111 , south @entity112 - so for five weeks she was sent 30 miles away to @entity113 , @entity114 , and @entity115 , @entity116			2
her father @entity117 , a window cleaner , had to borrow money to afford to see her			0
' it was an hour 's drive each way , ' she said			0
' he came to see me as much as he could but he had to work more hours and borrow money			0
' i was so isolated			0
i had to go without seeing any of my friends because they did n't know how to get to me and could n't afford it			0
' one of the main ways i had got through it was to have people around me so it was a lot harder being so out of touch			0
' @entity100 , who now plans to study mental health nursing at university in september , said : ' i was sent to private hospitals twice because they had no beds			1
' i ca n't even imagine how much that cost them			0
it seems like such a waste			0
it just does n't make sense			0
' the figures obtained by @entity8 are just a snapshot of the picture across @entity148 , because the other @entity5 trusts we asked did not or could not respond to our requests in full			1
but the figures come just two months after the @entity153 warned care was at crisis point , with 1,500 mental health beds closed down since 2010			1
general secretary dr @entity157 told @entity8 demand has risen by almost a third since 2010			0
' it ’s a false economy to make these sorts of cuts , ' he said			0
' this increased @entity5 spending on private sector beds is a sign that the health service lacks capacity and urgently needs to increase its own provision			1
' this short - sighted approach also undermines the quality of patient care			0
' inadequate provision means there ’s a severe lack of mental health beds in many communities and too many patients have to go hundreds of miles away from home to access a service			1
condemned : the @entity153 's @entity157 ( pictured ) said the cuts were a ' false economy ' ' some patients with serious mental illnesses are having to wait until their health deteriorates to such an extent that they have to be detained before they start getting specialist care			2
' children with mental health problems have been placed in police cells because there are n’t beds available			2
' one of the worst offenders was the @entity112 and @entity5 trust , which leaped from spending £ 1.8million in 2011/12 to £ 5.5million last year			1
it admitted the increase was due to a ' huge demand on our services and the consequent need for some of our patients to be admitted to overspill beds managed by private sector organisations			2
' but it insisted costs are expected to come down this year after ' significant changes ' including more information for nurses , more funding and a specialist team to monitor private spending			2
another of the worst offenders was the @entity116 and @entity214			0
it spent just £ 121,000 on private beds in 2011/12 , but this rose to £ 1.2million the next year and an eye - watering £ 5.7million the year after			1
that figure , apparently the most drastic increase in @entity148 , was originally revealed by @entity222 campaigner @entity221 who described it as a ' scandal '			0
the @entity116 and @entity226 trust insisted running out of beds was not the only reason patients had to be placed in private care			2
' reasons may include a specific specialist need for certain conditions or disorders which is not provided on an inpatient basis within our @entity237 , ' a spokesman said			0
' other reasons may include the inability of a service user to be able to travel to the nearest @entity5 inpatient unit and a private sector bed is in fact closer to their home			1
' the 22 trusts chosen were the only ones to provide complete information in response to a @entity41 request by @entity8			1
out of area beds also include money paid from one @entity5 hospital to another , not just money paid to private firms			1
however , our requests asked for information only about private sector beds			2
worst offenders : the @entity112 and @entity262 trust spent £ 5.5million - a leap of £ 3.7m in just two years just three of the 22 health trusts reduced the amount they spent on private beds - and just three increased the number of beds on their own wards			1
in some areas , bed cuts were drastic			1
one trust alone , @entity274 and @entity275 , axed 74 mental health beds from its stock of 322 in just two years - a cut of almost a quarter			1
at the other end of @entity283 , @entity280 and @entity281 axed 42 beds from its 2011 stock of 209 - which had already been drastically reduced from the 249 it had in 2009			0
just three @entity280 and @entity281 patients were placed in private sector beds in the year before the @entity289			2
@entity290 went to the private sector the next year , 13 the year after , and 32 the year after that			0
yet in 2013/14 , the number skyrocketed to 96 - costing @entity5 chiefs £ 1.4million			1
criticism : @entity45 's @entity296			0
the government said it was introducing new ways to cut the spend @entity45 shadow health minister @entity296 condemned the figures			1
she told @entity8 : ' instead of prioritising mental health as they promised , the government has cut mental health services more than other hospital services			2
' we have seen increased waiting times , people having to travel hundreds of miles to get the help they need or not getting any help at all			2
' dr @entity312 , @entity283 's director for people with long term conditions , said : ' we know mental health services across the country are facing challenges and it can be difficult to ensure capacity is always at the right point in the system			0
' however , we have announced the first waiting times and access standards in mental health for both psychological therapies and early intervention for psychosis			0
' this is intended to help rebalance the system focusing initially on reducing waiting times for people with anxiety , depression , eating disorders and first episode psychosis			0
' we want to ensure patients are able to access high quality care at an early stage , reducing demand for acute admissions			0
' the @entity341 said it has new measures to stop mental health patients ending up in police cells , and is spending £ 120million to reduce the amount of time people had to wait for @entity5 treatment			1
a spokesman added the government has invested £ 450million since 2010 to improve access to talking therapies , helping almost 1million people			0
' the government has made it clear that beds must always be available for those who need them , ' the spokesman added			0
' for the first time ever we 're collecting data on people travelling long distances for care so that services can be held to account			0
' we are going further than ever before to put mental health on a par with physical health and we expect @entity368 , who have committed to making this a reality , to ensure mental health does n't lose out in local spending			2
' misplaced : the @entity153 says children with mental health problems are ending up in cells figures provided by individual trusts under @entity41			2
* figures for @entity380 / @entity379 and @entity381 supplemented by figures provided by @entity383			0
many other trusts / @entity385 did not provide complete / comparable information for all three years .			0

private beds , used when @entity5 runs out , are costly and often miles away
but shock figures show they are being used more as @entity5 bed cuts bite
22 @entity5 trusts increased their spending from £ 14.7m to £ 38.2m in 2 years
the same 22 trusts cut the number of beds on their own wards by 6.1 *%*
figures *slammed* by charities , nurse leaders and shadow health minister
