millions of people given extortionate car parking charges outside train stations , @entity4 hospitals and supermarkets could be in line for a refund thanks to a new campaign			1
@entity10 law graduate @entity9 , 22 , is leading a legal battle to have the ' fines ' overturned in what could be @entity15 's largest ever group litigation			1
private companies which run car parks outside some of @entity15 's biggest store chains - including @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23 - will often allow customers to park for free , but threaten a large fine for exceeding a certain time limit			1
however , mr @entity9 believes that these fines are unlawful - and is trying to gather 100,000 cases together to go to the @entity29 and prove it			1
clamping down : a new campaign is challenging extortionate penalty charge notices handed out by private companies outside hospitals , shops and train stations - and could get tens of millions of people a refund if he wins the landmark legal case , then that could open the door for ' at least 10million people ' to claim their money back , and could put a stop to the fines for good			1
he said : ' these " fines " are not official fines , but instead a matter of private law between two parties			1
' when you park in a car park you are entering into a contract with the company which provides that parking space			1
' if you breach a contract then under contract law that company is only allowed to make a claim for the amount they have actually lost			1
' because these spaces are free to park in , i would argue the amount is actually nothing			2
' people take cases like this to the county court fairly regularly , and judges will often rule that the fines are unenforceable and the charge will be overturned			1
' however , because of the way the county court system works , this will only settle the claim between one person and one company			2
' by gathering the cases together , and taking it to the @entity29 , we can set a legal precedent			1
' when a judge made a similar ruling over @entity88 , it opened the door to a flood of claims that has seen banks set aside tens of billions of pounds in repayments			1
in the case of @entity88 , the ruling applied to 90 per cent of policies sold			2
mr @entity9 believes a new ruling could apply to 98 per cent of parking fines handed out by private companies			1
raking it in : money collected from parking charge notices has almost doubled in the last four years alone growing problem : each time a private company issues a fine , they request the driver 's details from the @entity110			1
this data shows that , in 2014 alone , nearly 2.7million fines will be issued an estimated 2.2million such fines were handed out last year alone , and that number is set to rise to 2.7million this year			1
in total , it is estimated that these companies will collect around £ 127million in so - called ' fines ' this year alone , almost double the £ 93million collected in 2010 , and a 600 per cent increase on 2006 , when just £ 21million was charged to motorists			1
mr @entity9 added : ' in my opinion [ the charges ] are unlawful			1
it is remarkable that the parking firms are happy to send out so many " fines " , despite their legality not being clear			1
' to make an estimated £ 176m industry out of this , without having clear legal precedent to do so , is concerning			2
' he is currently gathering interest on his challenge the @entity135 website , before deciding whether to go ahead with the scheme			0
if enough people sign up , he will attempt to gather 100,000 cases together before going to court			1
he added : ' i think the law is pretty clear in this area , as evidenced by the conclusions of county court judges			1
' but the law on how to organise such big cases is uncertain			1
we 're going to be asking the judge some pretty novel questions so we might get some pretty novel answers			0
' among the companies using the potentially illegal practices is @entity153 , which manages spaces outside @entity4 hospitals , along high streets , and beside major retailers such as @entity158 and @entity159			1
fighting back : @entity10 law graduate @entity9 is trying to gather 100,000 cases together to take to the @entity29 , which will make his case the biggest ever group litigation in @entity15 history other companies include @entity165 , which controls spaces outside many budget supermarkets including @entity168 , @entity21 and @entity20 , and @entity169 , which deals largely with shopping parks and stores such as @entity22 and @entity23			1
the companies will issue ‘ parking charge notices ’ – named to replicate official council ‘ penalty charge notices ’ – but which do not have the same legal standing as official fines			1
a growing number of people are refusing to pay , and because of this firms often follow the ' fines ' with letters threatening court action , in the hope of browbeating people into submission			1
simply ignoring the legal summons is not enough , and will often end up with a person being issued with a @entity188 - which could prevent them from taking out loans or getting mortgages in the future			1
mr @entity9 , from @entity193 in @entity194 , attended @entity195 at @entity10 , earning a @entity197 degree in 2013 , and passing a @entity198 in 2014 , receiving some of the top grades in his year			0
rather than begin training as a lawyer , he decided he wanted to start up a company giving everyday people greater access to the courts			2
the idea to help fight parking fines came to him after a friend was hit with an excessive charge			1
in the future , he also hope to help fight rouge telephone callers			0
one pensioner was hit with a £ 70 parking fine at a local @entity4 hospital after staying just 13 seconds too long			0
@entity214 , pictured right , paid 50p to park for 30 minutes while she had an x-ray at the @entity217 in @entity218 last month			0
the 64 - year - old from @entity220 was shocked when a fine for £ 70 from @entity222 landed on her doorstep a week later			0
cameras had recorded her entering the car park – before she even had a chance to park – at 10.14am and 47 seconds			0
it logged her leaving at 10.45am , meaning she was penalised just over £ 5 for each of the 13 extra seconds			0
mrs @entity214 said : ‘ i have no problem in paying to park at the hospital			0
i ’m all for the hospital making money from it			0
' but i do n’t understand why they ’re using some car park management company , like @entity165 , who are just there literally to cash in as soon as they can			0
’ mrs @entity214 appealed and the fine was waived			0
she said : ‘ it seems to me that if you appeal they let you off – that ’s what ’s happened to lots of people i know			2
' they ’re not interested in pursuing it at all , they ’re just after catching the poor innocent person who is going to pay up			0
’ when @entity254 ’s two - year - old son fell seriously ill and began having fits , she rushed him to @entity257 hospital a couple of miles away			0
the 37 - year - old parked at the children ’s @entity260 unit and ran inside with her son and eight - month - old daughter			0
on her return , she was horrified to find she had been given a £ 60 fine for parking in the drop - off bay			0
she said : ‘ i was stunned			0
there was no way i could leave one of my children behind in the car and i had to get my son into the hospital as quickly as possible			0
’ her son had an infection of his lymph nodes and needed treatment for the next three weeks			0
mrs @entity254 , pictured left , said : ‘ i was shocked they would ticket someone who was clearly in an emergency , but they just said : “ you should have got an ambulance ”			0
’ the mother of three refused to pay the fine on ‘ moral grounds ’ , but it was increased to £ 100 and she received threatening letters from @entity153 warning her of legal action			0
she said : ‘ it was causing me and my partner immense stress , so in the end we had to pay			2
’ mrs @entity254 added that she was relieved the aggressive practices at @entity257 hospital had been reined in by the management			0
‘ it was a disgrace , ’ she said			0
‘ many of these people are very sick and yet they are being targeted by a firm looking to make a profit			2
’ an 80 - year - old diabetic was targeted by @entity304 ’s private parking wardens after suffering a medical emergency while parked at its outlet at @entity308			2
@entity309 , right with his daughter @entity310 , needed to wait at the restaurant longer than planned to ensure his blood sugar had stabilised before he could to drive on safely			0
two days later a parking penalty notice arrived from @entity315			2
it had captured the details of the car using automatic number plate recognition cameras and the official @entity110 database			0
after the firm was told about his condition it doubled the charge from £ 50 to £ 100 because it was not paid within 14 days			2
mr @entity309 , from @entity326 in @entity194 , had travelled to the airport last summer to pick up his daughter @entity310 , who owns the car			0
miss @entity329 , 54 , said : ‘ effectively , we were sent a £ 100 penalty for over-staying by just 16 minutes			2
’ the civil servant launched a successful appeal to the independent tribunal service @entity335 and the penalty was cancelled .			2
