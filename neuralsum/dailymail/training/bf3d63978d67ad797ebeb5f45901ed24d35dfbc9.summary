when @entity1 and his wife @entity2 moved to a sleepy corner of southern @entity4 , they were hoping for a peaceful retirement			1
but within months of settling in the village of @entity8 , they found themselves embroiled in a bitter feud with their neighbour – another @entity13 expatriate – over access to their front door			1
the @entity4 media have dubbed it @entity19 ( @entity20 of the @entity13 ) after @entity21 nailed up the @entity23 ’ window shutters and blocked their front door with wooden fence posts secured with cement			1
it was the final chapter in a 10 - year row with their neighbours mr @entity37 is believed to object to his neighbours being able to look out over ‘ his ’ driveway			1
his fury has prompted him to write to everyone from his local police force back in @entity44 to the @entity45 , while one 85 - page epic was even sent to former @entity4 president @entity47			2
the latest development saw the @entity49 forced to come and go via their back garden instead of the driveway leading to the pair of stone houses , which mr @entity37 , 67 , says they have no right to use			2
far from dismissing the row among ‘ les rosbifs ’ with a @entity61 shrug , @entity4 residents of the village – population 258 – have rallied round the @entity62 , with some 60 of them marching on the properties ‘ to rescue ’ the couple			1
blocked in : @entity1 and @entity32 bought the property near @entity66 when they retired in 2004 enraged : mr @entity37 sparked outrage in the village of @entity8 by building a brick wall across the front door video courtesy of the @entity72 ‘ we could not accept that they should continue to live under such terror , ’ said @entity73 , 83 , a retired policeman			1
‘ we shouted , whistled against their unscrupulous neighbours			0
’ @entity79 - born mr @entity1 , 72 , a retired engineer , moved to @entity80 , in the foothills of the @entity82 , with his wife in 2004 from @entity84 , @entity85			0
mr @entity37 , formerly from @entity86 , and his wife @entity87 , thought to be @entity88 , moved there eight months later – and soon began raising objections over the @entity23 ’ windows , which overlook the driveway			0
although access to the driveway was not written into the property ’s deeds , @entity4 law guarantees right of way if an entrance has been used continuously for at least 30 years			2
the @entity23 have produced a series of affidavits to confirm this is the case with their house , and a local civil court will now rule on the matter			0
‘ for the last 150 years , the only access to the house was from that drive , ’ said mr @entity1			2
‘ they knew all this before they even bought their house			0
’ mr @entity37 has refused to comment , telling one reporter : ‘ i am deaf , i can not hear what you say , i am deaf			0
' ' intrusion ' : the @entity117 , who live in this house ( left ) claim the privacy of their home ( pictured ) has been infringed by the @entity23 ' windows			0
