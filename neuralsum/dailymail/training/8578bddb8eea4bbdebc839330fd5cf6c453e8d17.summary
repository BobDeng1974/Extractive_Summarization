by @entity0 published : 08:19 est , 5 september 2013 updated : 12:33 est , 5 september 2013 these remarkable images show the beautiful gala pool of the @entity3 filled with water once again , two decades after it closed its doors			2
the pool was filled with 86,000 gallons of water for the first time in four years to celebrate the historic baths receiving £ 3.4million from @entity12 tv show restoration			1
synchronised swimmers from group @entity14 took to the water to mark the anniversary of the funding - received ten years ago from the show			1
synchronised swimmers , right , celebrate the occasion by performing a routine standing empty : the beautiful baths , pictured from the outside above , stood empty for 10 years before receiving funding from restoration 10 years ago before : the pool , one of two in the @entity3 building that received £ 3.4million of funding from the @entity12 , pictured empty unused : in the past , the pool was used to train both male and female professional and synchronised swimmers first opened in 1906 , the pool was the breeding ground for numerous swimming champions before it closed in 1993			1
at the time , swimmers took to the streets in protest to try and prevent the closure of the building - which includes two swimming pools and a @entity50 @entity49 area			0
but as the @entity51 were expensive to run , they closed on 13 march 1993			2
ten years later , the building won a public vote to receive £ 3.4m of funding from the @entity12 show			1
thousands of viewers voted for the beautiful building to receive the funding and work started almost immediately			0
since then , that money has been spent restoring the building - including a new £ 13,000 ‘ @entity63 ’ stained glass above the gala pool , which was unveiled yesterday			1
external work : almost all of the £ 3.4million @entity12 funding was used to restore the outside of the @entity3 restored : the striking ' @entity63 ' window , left , has been restored , having been boarded up since 1993			1
other glass - work in doors into the pools , right , has also been renovated the striking window was created by glass specialist @entity73 , based in @entity75 , and includes 493 individual pieces of glass set into 12 panels			2
it was made using archive images of the original window , which had been boarded up since the @entity49 's closure			2
an additional £ 2million has been raised by the @entity3 and spent on the work			0
but those behind the project say the baths are a long way from being fully restored - and need an additional £ 20million of funding to complete the necessary work			1
@entity90 , project manager of the @entity3 , said the anniversary was a great day for the baths and it signaled a landmark in its continued restoration			0
she said : ' seeing the gala pool filled again today has reignited the excitement around the baths and our vision for the future			0
' had the baths not won @entity102 ten years ago , we would never have been able to achieve what we have			1
in action : synchronised swimmers , @entity106 , performed a routine in the gala pool making a splash : the swimmers performed a series of athletic jumps and dives to celebrate the 10 - year anniversary ' there ’s still a long way to go but we are absolutely determined in our mission to reopen the @entity50 baths and one of the pools to the public once again			2
we would like to thank those who have supported our progress both locally and across the country , and invite them to join us at our upcoming @entity127 , which will be another chance for people to explore the building and join in the celebration			0
' other celebrations took part on the anniversary , yesterday including a performance from the well known synchronised group @entity14 , who performed at comedian @entity139 ’s wedding and features @entity140 and @entity141 who competed at the @entity142			0
the event also marked the launch of the @entity145 , a new @entity146 - wide support group spearheaded by @entity3 to share ideas about restoration and fund - raising projects			0
a series of further celebrations are due to take place this month , including a cello concert on thursday 12 september .			0
