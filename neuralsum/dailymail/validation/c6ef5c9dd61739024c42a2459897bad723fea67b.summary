hitching a ride : @entity16 the friendly seal attempts to climb onto a kayak in @entity8 , @entity9 attempt one : the young pup makes it onto one of the kayaks , and momentarily keeps his balance he then manages to get onto the left kayak , but just as it looks like he has found himself a comfortable spot - he falls in again			1

this is the third time mr @entity30 has had an encounter with @entity16 the @entity37 in four months			1
last november , while mr @entity30 was practicing rolling his kayak in the water , he noticed the seal watching him and then joining in , rolling every time he did			1
fail : unfortunately for @entity16 , he can not manage to stay on the kayak , and falls back in the water on it again : @entity16 the seal proves he is not a quitter and is soon at it again , trying to climb the kayaks a month later , the pair met again , as @entity16 jumped on the back of his kayak and hitched a ride around for several hours			1
the latest encounter , filmed by mr @entity30 , lasted for four hours with @entity16 climbing on and off mr @entity30 's kayak and even bringing him a fish it had caught			1
mr @entity30 , from @entity57 , said : ' i 've had quite a few encounters with @entity16 now , we are becoming good friends ! ' the first time i saw him was when i was practising rolling my kayak			1
@entity16 seemed to roll whenever i rolled my kayak			2
' afterwards i put a message on a @entity66 local community page asking if anyone knew anything about the seal and i got lots of responses			0
the locals have called it @entity16 , as in @entity74			2
' i think when @entity16 now sees me he feels comfortable			2
' this time i was out on my own and i saw another kayaker			0
i asked him if he could brace or roll his kayak in case @entity16 got on his boat and tipped up over			2
resting spot : kayaker @entity30 shot the video of the young seal 's repeated attempts to climb aboard his raft as he paddled in @entity8 new buddies : their encounter lasted for four hours with @entity16 climbing on and off mr @entity30 's kayak and even bringing him a fish it had caught another ride : this is the third time @entity16 and mr @entity30 , from @entity57 , has met in four months ' he said he could n't so he came alongside me and held on to my kayak			1
' i do n't think he believed me that @entity16 would come over but he did			2

' @entity99 , from @entity100 , said : ' this is a young grey seal			1
seals tend to be a bit wary of people , we do n't know why this one is n't			0
it might just be a personality thing			0
' they are solitary animals when they are at sea			0
they come together for breeding but generally are solitary in the water			0
' young ones tend to be more friendly and playful			0
i have dived with seals and the young ones will come near you , they can be quite curious and like playing hide and seek , but the adults do n't tend to			0
' the waters of the @entity122 are home to more than 180,000 grey seals , which is more than a third of the world 's population .			0
