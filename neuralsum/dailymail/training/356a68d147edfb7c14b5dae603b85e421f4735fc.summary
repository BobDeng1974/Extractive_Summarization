published : 05:28 est , 18 january 2013 updated : 08:07 est , 18 january 2013 traditionally , @entity0 was a solemn period of contemplation leading up to @entity2 when we wore hairshirts or denied ourselves food			1
but this year , the @entity6 is advocating a more modern approach , suggesting we turn off our computers and eat breakfast cornflakes more slowly , instead			2
new official guidelines on how we might observe @entity0 in 2013 also suggest we ' say hi to a neighbour ' and turn off lights in a room we 're not using			1
' have a screen - free day ' : the @entity6 's modern @entity17 guidelines are backed by the archbishop of @entity19 the 21st century take on the 40 - day religious observance comes in booklet called @entity0 , launched yesterday at the @entity22 by @entity19 dr @entity23			1
apparently inspired by the way @entity25 ' came together ' during last year 's jubilee and @entity28 celebrations , the @entity6 issued the new advice to encourage us to ' slow down ' in our hectic lives and ' come together ' for the good of our local communities			1
the booklet contains a different tip for each day of @entity0			1
one reads : ' it is so easy to get side - tracked , pulled into watching that bit more telly or to spend that bit more time on the computer			0
we do n’t intend to , it just happens			0
' sometimes all we need to do is to make the decision to do something different , some good that we meant to do but have n’t so ... do something different			2
' outside of work , have a screen free day and do something different ' ' really taste your cornflakes ' : the @entity6 advice is aimed at getting us to slow down another passage says : ' the world whirls by at ever - increasing speeds ...			1
we can go at such a speed that we forget to savour the good things that we have			1
' the ability to savour is a frame of mind , and if we become better at tasting our cornflakes we might discover that we get better at savouring other good things too , so slow down ... ' take longer over breakfast and really savour your cornflakes ( or whatever else you have ! ) '			1
no more hairshirts : the @entity6 has issued more modern advice for both adults and children the booklet includes eco-friendly advice such as ' fill a bag with litter ' , ' use the washing - up water to water some plants ' , and ' turn off the lights in rooms that no - one is using '			1
it also encourages @entity76 to build relationships within their community , suggesting ' invite someone you do n't know very well to tea ( or for a coffee , or for a drink ) ' , or to ' say hi to your neighbours today or when you next see them '			0
it says : ' the idea is that we learn new lessons about ourselves , about the world and about @entity91 that we then apply for the rest of our lives			0
' the booklet was written by theologian dr @entity95 and her husband , the reverend @entity96 , and they also produced a children 's version			2
the booklet contains suggestions for youngsters to try during @entity0 such as ' play with someone you do n't usually play with ' , and ' make some cakes and share them with your friends '			1
at yesterday 's launch , dr @entity23 said the new advice was aimed at bringing communities together as witnessed last year			2
he said : ' in 2012 the nation really came together during the @entity112 and the @entity113			0
' we saw people putting love and care for their neighbours into action , and there was a real mood of celebration			0
' when we all pull together , and do our bit , anything is possible			0
' the @entity0 books are a great source of encouragement for us to be the change we want to see in our communities			2
' we may feel our own contribution is small , but even a small drop of water can turn a waterwheel - in 2013 let 's aim for better			0
' @entity134 , mp , who chairs the @entity135 on @entity136 , said : ' this lent , i look forward to hearing of acts of kindness on the part of adults and children which can encourage us all			0
' say hi to your neighbours today or when you next see them try something new , for example a different food or a new experience fill a bag with litter ( then put it all in the bin ! ) say thank you to @entity91 for one of your meals today ask someone how they are and take time to listen to the answer use the washing - up water to water some plants take longer over breakfast really taste your cornflakes ( or whatever else you have ! ) sit still for five minutes and listen to your breathing give lots of smiles away today find something you do n't use and give it away learn the words of something by heart , for example a poem , prayer or son outside of work , have a screen - free day and do something different phone someone you love but have n't seen for a while			0

new official guidelines suggest we ' slow down and savour the good things '
