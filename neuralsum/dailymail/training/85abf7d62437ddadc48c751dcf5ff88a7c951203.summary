by @entity0 published : 06:33 est , 30 may 2013 updated : 04:14 est , 31 may 2013 hi beauty buddies , welcome back to @entity2 ! the weather ’s been a bit unpredictable here in @entity6 recently			1
one minute it ’s gloriously sunny , the next there ’s hailstones hammering down over our heads ! i know which side of it i prefer … anyway , it ’s nearly june and hopefully we ’ll be seeing some serious sunshine soon			1
summer is the time for bold , bright colours , and so i ’ve taken inspiration from the fresh , minimalistic make up looks on the @entity23 and @entity24 / s ‘ 13 catwalk shows to create this fabulously wearable summer ' pop ' lip			1
pop it ! summer is the time for bold , bright colours , says @entity0 , who has taken inspiration from the fresh , minimalistic make up looks on the @entity23 and @entity31 catwalk shows for this bright lipped look here ’s how i did it			1
to start off , i applied the @entity35 and @entity36			2
the foundation itself has a great creamy consistency – it ’s not too thick and provides the perfect amount of breathable coverage for the daytime			2
i put a little bit on the back of my hand and dabbed it gently onto my face using my fingertips			2
i wanted a fresh , dewy base for this look , so this product was the ideal choice ; it gives skin a gorgeous radiant glow without looking too caked - on			1
how to do a @entity55 with @entity56 this look is all about the lips , so naturally i did n’t want to go overboard with my eye make up			2
a touch of white eyeshadow was all i needed to define the eye area and make me look more awake – i opted for the light shade from the @entity65 6 @entity64 palette			0
using a small brush , i swept a small amount of the shadow onto my eyelids and tear ducts			0
this helps open up the eyes without drawing attention away from the main attraction – the lips ! get lippy : this look is all about the lips , so naturally i did n't want to go overboard with my eye make up			0
a touch of white eyeshadow was all i needed following this , i brushed a coat of @entity82 mascara onto my lashes for a hint of definition			0
this mascara is great for lengthening and curling the lashes ; i applied just enough to give my lashes a natural looking flutter			0
when wearing matte lipstick , particularly in a colour this bold , it ’s essential to make sure the lips are prepped beforehand so you get a perfect , long - lasting finish			1
i used the @entity95 in @entity96 to do this ; it ’s a gorgeous lip balm which moisturises the lips and provides a smooth base for which to apply lipstick , as well as helping the colour stay put for longer			0
after making sure my pout was primed to perfection , i liberally applied @entity104 in @entity105 for a super-vibrant pop of pink			0
this lipstick is the ultimate in show - stopping colour ; it ’s a bright fuschia with blue undertones – you certainly wo n’t go unnoticed with this shade ! i then went back to the @entity35 and @entity36 and dotted a little bit of the concealer around my lips to cover up any mistakes i had made			1
i also dabbed some on my @entity120 ’s bow to make my lips look fuller and more voluptuous			0
for the finishing touch , i swept a teeny bit of the @entity123 across my cheekbones to give a subtle glow			0
if you ’re working on a budget , here are some fab alternatives you can use to recreate this look : @entity131 @entity132 in shade 2 @entity133 @entity134 @entity135 renew @entity104 in @entity136 @entity137 so there you have it – a gorgeous summer pop lip that works brilliantly for day or night			1
now all i need is some sun …			0
until next time , @entity56 x			1

summer is the time for bold , bright colours
