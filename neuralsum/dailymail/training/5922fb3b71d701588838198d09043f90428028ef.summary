an inventor has created a terrifying means of using a slingshot to apply a condom - and says it is all in the name of beating sexually transmitted infections			1
@entity7 , of @entity8 , designed the @entity9 in a light - hearted attempt to win a £ 65,000 ( $ 100,000 ) grant from the @entity12			1
mr @entity7 , from @entity13 , in @entity14 , created the gadget in response to the foundation ’s offer of grants for people who could cut sexually transmitted diseases and unwanted pregnancies by creating the next generation of condoms			1
condoms are seen as vital for preventing unwanted pregnancies and @entity44 but are often shunned on the basis that they are thought to reduce sexual pleasure			0
therefore , the @entity12 is looking for an idea which leads to the creation of condoms that increase pleasure in the hope this will encourage people to use them			2
mr @entity7 ’s contraption allows the unlucky subject to attach a condom to the barrel of the slingshot gun			1
they can then prepare the gun for firing before pulling the trigger at close range and releasing the condom at high speed			2
mr @entity7 has posted a video of the eye - watering device on @entity69 and in the two days since it appeared it has been viewed nearly two million times			1
in the video the inventor says : ‘ @entity8 can not stand back when someone poses a great challenge			2
‘ of course there are problems - like the lack of accuracy , and the fear			2
' but of course , it needs some improvement			0
' that is why i need the money			0
’ he adds : ‘ nothing fascinates male human beings more than guns and sex so when we combine both you must see the huge potential this has			0
‘ so , come on , pass over the hundred grand and then we will make a product out of this			0
’ mr @entity7 's contraption allows the unlucky subject to attach a condom to the barrel of the slingshot gun the trigger can then be pulled causing the condom to fire at high speed mr @entity7 accepts that the device still needs some work as it causes ' fear ' and ' pain ' the @entity12 , a private foundation that focuses on enhancing healthcare and reducing poverty , is offering $ 100,000 worth of start - up money for any inventor who can increase the appeal of condom use			1
it is hoped that the inventor will manage to design a condom that does not reduce sexual pleasure meaning that people are not tempted to go without them			0
@entity36 and @entity37 believe that this is important as a means of reducing the spread of @entity44 , including @entity125 .			0

@entity7 has built a slingshot which can be used to apply a condom
it has to be fired at very close range and mr @entity7 admits it can be ' painful '
created it following @entity12 's appeal for new condom technology
put a video on @entity69 of slingshot in *action* - viewed *1.7* million times
