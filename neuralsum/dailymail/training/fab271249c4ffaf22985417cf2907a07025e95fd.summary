first , there was the winning goal at @entity72 on his full @entity74 debut			1
then , alongside the likes of @entity78 and @entity79 , he picked up a pair of awards at a glitzy ceremony in @entity24			1
and to cap it off , it was he who came from the bench to nick @entity10 ’s winner against @entity26 on saturday			1
‘ it feels incredible , ’ said the £ 1.5million former @entity87 forward , who scored 16 times in @entity24 ’s second tier last season			1
‘ i could n’t ask for any more			0
it is a dream come true for me			0
to make the jump from a team like @entity87 to playing in the @entity74 is incredible really			1
it is something that i always wanted to do			0
‘ it ’s been a really good week with the two goals , but more importantly because it ’s the fourth consecutive win for the team			2
it has been a really good time for the club			2
’ and what of those awards ? best breakthrough player and best attacking midfielder in @entity109			0

these clubs have not shared a 0 - 0 draw since february 1974			1
it is all a far cry from behind - closed - doors practice matches against @entity140 opposition			0
@entity0 scored four in an 8 - 0 win that afternoon and his new team - mates are said to be quite taken with the under - 21 international , who had offers from @entity146 and @entity147 before joining the @entity29 in june			1
the intention , however , was to stagger his introduction to the senior set - up			0
rather , his impact has been staggering			0
‘ there was a lot of interest in me from some very important teams , but i always knew that @entity10 would be the right move and the last few results have just proved that , ’ he said			2

i feel like i ’m settling in well and i just ca n’t wait to play more games now because i feel like when i play i can score more goals			2
’ his headed winner at @entity72 was followed by a predatory stab against @entity26 , seizing upon a mistake by compatriot @entity22 to pierce @entity20 ’s target			2
and manager @entity177 feels @entity0 is a natural in the penalty box			2
‘ he has a knack , ’ said the @entity10 boss , whose own position is now safe on the back of four straight wins			2
‘ he has a lot to learn about the @entity74 but you know that if something falls for him he will score			2
you sometimes get a player who can do it in training but not on matchday , but he has shown he can do that and has had a fabulous week			0
’ from @entity2 to @entity193 , the rookie striker is certainly passing his @entity74 screen test			1
