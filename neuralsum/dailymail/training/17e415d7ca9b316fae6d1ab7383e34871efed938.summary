childminders and nurseries will be able to double the number of children they look after under radical plans to cut care bills for working families			1
ministers are considering a move to copy @entity10 childcare rules where each member of staff can look after up to eight children			1
in @entity15 the limit is just four toddlers			0
it is hoped that reducing the red - tape burden on employers will help to bring down childcare bills which sees @entity22 parents spending more than a quarter of their income on looking after their children			1
nursery staff would be able to look after more children under plans to cut huge bills for families which see mothers with a full - time job needing to work for up to four months of the year just to break even education minister @entity33 today signalled she wants to tear up ‘ onerous requirements on numbers ’ to bring reduce nursery bills			1
@entity22 has some of the highest childcare costs in the world , meaning the typical mother with one child and a full - time job needs to work for up to four months of the year just to break even			0
millions with two or more children conclude it is not worth working at all			0
but miss @entity33 said the problem could be tackled without additional government funding			0
she pointed to ‘ strong examples ’ in @entity48 where rules on staff ratios are less stringent , which would enable nurseries to employ fewer , better - paid staff			0
the minister warned that in the @entity22 some poorly - paid childcare workers do not have good qualifications in @entity15 and maths ‘ yet we expect them to help our young children learn to speak and do their first sums ’			1
in @entity10 @entity60 offer traditional nursery style teaching by teachers in large groups of 3 and 4 year olds and the government there is about to extend them to disadvantaged two - year - olds			0
@entity10 crèches for the under - 3s are also in much demand , miss @entity33 said			1
education minister @entity33 warned salaries for nursery staff are being capped by ' of onerous requirements on numbers ' ‘ they operate with fewer staff who are better qualified and better paid than their @entity15 equivalents , ’ she said in an article for the @entity78 website			1
in @entity10 , staff are paid over £ 16,000 and are responsible for up to eight toddlers			2
the figure in @entity86 and @entity87 is up to six children			0
by comparison , nursery staff in @entity15 earn £ 13,000 and can be responsible for no more than four toddlers			2
miss @entity33 said : ‘ in @entity15 , we need to move to a simpler , clearer system that prioritises quality and safety over excessive bureaucracy			1
‘ we also need to think about the balance between the number and quality of staff in our system			2
‘ it is no coincidence that we have the most restrictive adult - child ratios for young children of comparable @entity48 countries as well as the lowest staff salaries			0
‘ our ratios put a cap on the salaries staff can be paid because of onerous requirements on numbers			2
‘ if staff are being paid barely more than minimum wage , nurseries struggle to retain and recruit high quality people			0
’ however , @entity117 warned a move towards the @entity10 system could harm the quality of care			1
shadow education secretary @entity122 said : ' @entity123 is presiding over a childcare crisis – with 381 @entity126 centres shut down , spiralling costs for working parents and less support through tax credits			2
' now his own children ’s minister says they plan to cut the number of nursery staff – which experts say will threaten child safety and the quality of care for toddlers			1
' ministers are expected to set out a major overhaul of childcare next week			0
staff in @entity10 nurseries can care for eight children , compared to just four toddlers in @entity15 in addition to changes to staffing ratios , it is likely to include generous tax breaks being offered to families with children under five who need to pay for nurseries and childminders			1
senior coalition figures are to meet later this week to finalise a deal expected to be worth up to £ 2,000 per year per child for all working parents			0
the favoured model would more than make up for the loss of child benefit for better - off families that comes into effect today – but only for those where both parents work .			0

in @entity10 staff can look after up to eight children but in @entity15 the number is just four
education minister @entity33 says @entity22 nursery workers are badly paid because of ' onerous ' rules on numbers
coalition to *announce* overhaul of childcare including tax breaks for working families as early as next week
@entity117 warns @entity10 system could pose risks to the quality of care
