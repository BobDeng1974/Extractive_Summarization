by @entity0 published : 07:54 est , 13 november 2013 updated : 09:03 est , 13 november 2013 @entity1 , 39 , needed 12 stitches in this gash above his eye after he was attacked in @entity5 on his way home from his girlfriend 's birthday party a couple walking home from a birthday party were beaten unconscious after they chanced upon a gang of youths vandalising cars			1
@entity1 , 39 , and his girlfriend @entity17 had been celebrating her 42nd birthday at a pub in @entity20 , @entity5 , when they came across five young men kicking wing mirrors off cars			1
these horrifying pictures show how badly mr @entity1 , a welder , was beaten - he needed 12 stitches to his face and doctors said he narrowly missed being blinded , while his girlfriend was barely able to speak for a week afterwards			1
the thugs launched their unprovoked attack when @entity31 , an office assistant , turned to look at one of the vandals , who were aged between 16 - 20 , she said : ' i just turned around and looked at them , or huffed at them			2
suddenly one of them threw a bottle , or a wing mirror , and it hit @entity1 right in the face , just above his eye			1
' there was blood everywhere			0
' the blow slashed open mr @entity1 's face and he was knocked unconscious , landing on the ground			1
the young men then turned on his girlfriend			2
miss @entity31 said : ' i think they would have done something even if i had not looked at them			0
then i remember one of them saying " leave it " to the horrible one and i was hit on the back of the head			0
' i do n't know if it was a fist or an object , but it knocked me out			0
' miss @entity31 fell in the street and believes she was then dragged onto the pavement during the assault , which occurred shortly after midnight on 26 october , because when she came round she had finger marks and bruises on her wrist and ankle			2
she added : ' i thought they had taken @entity1 off and killed him because i could n't see him anywhere			2
' he had been knocked out too and when he came round he did not realise i was on the floor , so he had legged it up the road after them			0
' i ran to a house nearby , knocked on the door and they called the police			0
' doctors told mr @entity1 , pictured after the attack , left , that he narrowly missed being blinded in his right eye knocked out : both mr @entity1 and his girlfriend @entity17 lost consciousness during the assault which took place in the early hours of the morning the attack , which happened at around 12.20am , was captured on cctv but the streetlights had been turned off at 11.30pm in a cost - cutting move , meaning the footage is too dark to see			1
the couple were taken to @entity5 's @entity92 where @entity31 , who suffered from concussion , had a @entity96 scan and her boyfriend had the gash above his eye stitched			1
they both had to have a week off work and @entity17 is still suffering with neck pain three weeks later			2
the young men in the gang were aged between 16 and 20 and the main culprit is mixed race and of a ' very thin ' build , while the others are thought to be white			0
@entity108 and @entity111 police spokesman @entity109 said : ' enquiries , including the examination of closed - circuit television , are being undertaken			0
' we would like to speak to anyone who witnessed the assault , or knows any of the people involved			0
