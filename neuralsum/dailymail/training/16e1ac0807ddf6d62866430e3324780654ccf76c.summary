@entity0 who advises the @entity2 government , has written books denouncing @entity5 rule of the @entity6 a leading propagandist in @entity2 ’s long - running campaign to claim the @entity6 has been denounced as a traitor – not just to the @entity6 , where he was born , but to his daughters and heavily pregnant former wife			1
@entity0 , who advises the @entity2 government , has written books denouncing @entity5 rule of the ‘ @entity6 ’ , including a recently published work presented to @entity15 , an @entity2 by birth , a few weeks ago			1
but the family he abandoned when he left the @entity6 has spoken out , claiming the real reason he left was not to follow political principle but to pursue an @entity2 mistress @entity20 , in june 1982			1
his @entity5 daughter , @entity21 , said : ‘ we were brought up with the knowledge that my father had cheated on my mother and left her when she was heavily pregnant for an @entity2 woman just before the @entity27			1
‘ the reason my father left the @entity6 was never political			1
he actually made a choice to abandon my pregnant mother for this woman and everyone on the islands knows about this			2
‘ since he has left the islands for @entity2 he has not acknowledged our existence and has chosen not to participate in our lives			1
i would not want anything to do with him			0
’ now a senior @entity2 civil servant , @entity0 remarried in @entity2 and in 2007 unsuccessfully stood for mayor of @entity42 , which is the country ’s second largest city			1
he is also a government adviser on the @entity6			2
he has been dubbed ‘ the @entity44 ’ – after the notorious @entity45 , who broadcast @entity48 propaganda to the @entity5 during the @entity49 and was hanged for treason in 1946			1
late last year , the @entity2 embassy in @entity52 issued a book called @entity54 in which @entity0 wrote a chapter about how he discovered the ‘ truth ’			1
he outlines @entity2 ’s historical claims , which centre on @entity60 ’s control of the islands during the 18th century , and his conviction that islanders were blocked from the truth by the @entity5			2
@entity0 , a fourth generation @entity66 , who changed his name from @entity68 to @entity69 , has previously said : ‘ i stood up for what i thought was best for the @entity6 , for the @entity6 , and that is where my heart still lies			1
’ yet for the family he abandoned , the book is another callous insult			2
@entity0 was born in 1947 and in 1978 he married his second wife @entity76 , who was working in @entity77 in @entity78			1
in january 1981 , @entity76 , a @entity79 , gave birth to @entity21 and soon after became pregnant again			2
now living in @entity81 , @entity76 , 62 , remembers the day that @entity82 abruptly ended their relationship with a phone call when she was visiting her family in the @entity79 port of @entity89			0
@entity0 married @entity76 in 1978 ( pictured ) - she now lives in @entity81 after he left her and their children she said : ‘ just a few days before christmas @entity82 phoned me and said : “ i have got someone else			1
we have fallen in love			0
i want you to stay with your mother in @entity79			0
” ‘ i said : “ thank you , so you are washing your hands of us ? no , thank you			0
we will sort this out when we are back in the @entity6			2
’ ‘ @entity82 had come out to collect me and the children			2
but on the plane back he told me that when we arrived in the @entity6 he would leave me			2
' that ’s exactly what he did			0
when we landed in @entity78 he went off			0
’ in 1987 @entity76 , @entity21 and @entity103 would move to the @entity5			0
@entity76 said : ‘ i was ill , i wanted a better future for my children and when @entity21 was only three she was being taught how to recognise a bomb			0
i did not want them growing up with this			0
‘ but the main reason was that after the war @entity111 used to go to school in the @entity6 , and if her father spoke out publicly in @entity2 , they would say , “ @entity115 , your father is a traitor ”			1
‘ what he did was not my fault , was not my children ’s fault			0
i did not want @entity111 to continue to suffer this and i did not want @entity21 or @entity103 growing up with this			0
‘ he does not mention in his book that we were married and had two children together			0
he never mentions to the @entity2 people that he left a heavily pregnant woman			1
he was never pro-argentine when we were married			0
on the contrary he was pro-british			0
he followed whatever the @entity2 government told him to do			1
’ @entity0 meanwhile is resigned to the fact that he can never go back to the @entity6			1
of the family he left behind he will say only : ‘ @entity136 might have to say does n’t interest me			2
' i am sure she tells a very neat version that fits into her life and way of thinking			0
i do n’t think it is anything worth troubling about			0
