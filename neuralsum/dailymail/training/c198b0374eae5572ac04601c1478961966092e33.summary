it 's the sort of far - fetched accident you would expect to see in a @entity4 sketch - but what happened to @entity6 the cat is no laughing matter			1
after being hit by a car at 70mph , the poor moggy became wedged head first in the front of the vehicle as it drove a further ten miles down the motorway			0
with his top half buried in the car 's grill and pressed against the hot running engine , the tips of his ears were agonisingly burnt off - leaving him as deformed as his namesake			2
no laughing matter : @entity6 is half concealed with his head wedged in the car 's grill the collision happened shortly before midnight when @entity27 was driving her @entity28 at full speed on the @entity30 past the @entity32 exit heading towards @entity33 , @entity34			1
the young woman told police she had not seen anything , but had heard a muffled thud and carried on without thinking much of it			0
but when she parked in @entity33 she realised that the grill on the front bumper had a cat 's body sticking out of it , with the head wedged inside			1
when she saw the animal was alive , she quickly called the police			2
@entity34 police spokesman @entity48 said : ' after hearing that a motorist had struck an animal at 120 kilometres - an - hour we were positive it would n't be alive , especially after then being carried along by the car for another 12 kilometres			1
' when we found out that it had indeed survived , it was a real surprise			0
sticky situation : the poor cat was left completely helpless after being hit by the car at 70mph and dragged for another ten miles down the motorway ' the officers were unable to free the cat and so a vet was called to carry out the complicated procedure			2
' the vet , @entity65 , 38 , then tranquillised @entity66 so that it could be removed without causing further injury			0
the stricken animal was taken to the veterinary surgery in @entity33 where it needed to be operated on several times to treat head injuries			1
mr @entity65 added : ' we had to operate on him three or four times but he is now out of danger for sure			0
' road to recovery : despite having most of his ears burnt off , @entity66 is now on the mend animal clinic boss @entity80 , 46 , said that @entity6 had head injuries but that the real damage had been caused by the hot motor			1
he added : ' i do n't think in all my years as a person in charge of an animal clinic that i have ever such a remarkable survival story			0
' when the owner was not found , the vet nicknamed the cat @entity6 to match his new unfortunate appearance			2
he has now been adopted by staff at the clinic , who say they want to keep him after all they have been through together .			0

@entity99 only saw the cat when she parked in next town - @entity33 , @entity34
@entity6 had to have several operations and lost his ears in *ordeal*
but *amazingly* - after surgery , resilient animal on the way back to full health
staff at the vets have grown *attached* to him and plan to keep him
