how many times did @entity0 witness this scene when he and @entity3 were @entity5 team - mates ? the ball lands at the @entity3 ’s feet and , without breaking stride , he coolly sends it beyond the opposition goalkeeper			1
such an image was once a source of joy for @entity0			1
the feeling it created on monday night was distinctly different			0
all smiles : striker @entity3 celebrates scoring in @entity5 ' 8 - 1 win over @entity0 's @entity18 any hope the former captain had of a shock triumph on his return to @entity23 was shredded from the moment @entity3 netted the first goal of his second spell in light blue			1
the peerless poacher duly completed a hat - trick amid a relentless rout that saw @entity0 ’s collection of part - time players five down by the break			1
it just so happened that monday was @entity3 ’s 31st birthday			1
you get the feeling he would n’t have wanted to celebrate in any other way			0
after an incredible 127 goals in his first @entity5 stint between 2006 and 2010 , he was now back in the old routine to aid a cruise into the quarter - finals of the @entity43			1
@entity44 will be hoping it also sparks @entity3 to provide the potency required to buoy their @entity48 challenge			1
with doubles from @entity51 and @entity52 , and a further strike from @entity54 , this became a gruelling evening for @entity0 and his charges			1
numerous members of the @entity58 side had turned in a shift in their respective trades before heading to @entity23 and tugging on their boots			0
come full - time , they could at least take the slimmest sliver of consolation from @entity65 ’s last - gasp reply			2
yet the resounding scoreline was not the only notable statistic to emerge last night			0
the attendance of 11,190 was the lowest at @entity23 since the @entity70 revolution of 1986			0
it made for an atmosphere far removed from some of the high - octane occasions @entity0 once savoured			1
tough to take : @entity18 player - manager , and former @entity5 midfielder , @entity0 looks on during the 8 - 1 defeat his last appearance as a player at the @entity81 ground had come against @entity82 in may 2009			1
by that point , of course , his number was up after upsetting manager @entity86 with his role in the @entity88 while on @entity90 duty a couple of months earlier			2
that foolish incident – when @entity0 and @entity92 had a booze binge at the national team hotel before compounding their felony with childish v - signs at photographers – cast a shadow over his second spell at the club			1
yet his achievements remain remarkable			0
before exiting to @entity103 , @entity0 signed off by lifting the @entity104 for a fifth time with victory over @entity107 at @entity108			1
added to five league titles and five @entity110 , not to mention reaching the @entity112 final , he stands as one of the most successful @entity5 players in the modern era			2
a total of 431 appearances produced 61 goals			2
@entity0 had insisted pre-match that he would attempt to take the game to @entity44 ’s men and duly set out his side in a bold 4 - 3 - 3 formation			1
their optimism did n’t last long			0
by half - time , he was doubtless wishing he had taken a far more cautious approach with a group of players whose @entity5 links extended well beyond the dug - out			1
@entity130 , a nephew of @entity86 , spearheaded their attack			0
@entity133 ’ s son @entity130 filled the right - back role			0
on the left wing was @entity136 , an old friend of @entity52 ’s from the @entity138 youth system			0
they were soon completely swamped by the superior quality of their hosts			0
@entity143 had already turned away a powerful drive from @entity145 before being beaten with 15 minutes on the clock			0
frustratingly for the @entity0 , it was a concession with its roots in a @entity18 attack			1
his namesake @entity130 fired a shot across the @entity5 goal before the threat floundered			2
@entity154 collected the ball deep inside his own half and drove fully 50 yards before dabbing a pass through for @entity3			2
his first - time finish was perfectly placed into the far corner of the net			0
the lead was doubled eight minutes later			0
a well - weighted pass from @entity52 released @entity163 on the left			0
his low cross was dummied by @entity3 and @entity145 stepped in with a low drive that @entity143 could n’t keep out			2
@entity3 then claimed his second after 32 minutes following a lovely little interchange			2
@entity52 rolled the ball across the area after being gifted possession by @entity133			0
@entity3 ran over it and spun into space , collecting the return from @entity154 and stroking another first - time shot inside the post			1
@entity51 lashed home eight minutes before the break , but the skipper was outdone in the long - range stakes on the stroke of half - time			0
old pals : @entity183 shakes hands with former team - mate @entity0 he help steer @entity54 ’s pass into the path of @entity52 and watched in admiration as the 20 - year - old curled a terrific 25 - yard effort beyond the despairing @entity143			1
@entity191 was in for @entity192 at the opposite end and was enjoying a far easier outing than his last cup tie , when he endured a nightmare in @entity198 ’s @entity104 success here in april			0
@entity0 hoped to finally bring @entity191 into action with a triple substitution at the break , but the flow of the game was soon flooding back towards @entity143			2
@entity5 replacement @entity205 , on for @entity154 , set up @entity52 for another lovely strike on 65 minutes – this time angled low across the @entity18 goalkeeper			1
@entity51 then sent an unstoppable blast from 20 yards into the top corner of the net after 77 minutes before @entity3 rounded off his treble two minutes later			2
yet again , it was the calmest of conversions			0
when @entity65 burst through in the final moments to zip a shot high past @entity191 , the veteran @entity215 looked furious at being left exposed			0
yet the remaining @entity5 fans simply broke into a charitable round of applause for opponents stuck through the wringer by @entity3 and his cohorts .			1

@entity3 scores hat - trick as @entity5 beat @entity18 8 - 1 in @entity43 third round
former @entity5 midfielder @entity0 is @entity18 's player - manager
@entity3 scored 127 goals in first spell with club between 2006 and 2010
