by @entity0 published : 10:34 est , 27 february 2013 updated : 04:17 est , 28 february 2013 it would be wise to keep away from this leopard , because after its latest meal it 'll be feeling a bit prickly			1
the big cat must have been extremely hungry to even think of tackling a porcupine bristling with needle - sharp quills			1
but the battle commenced and the leopard suffered for its supper			1
it was speared by the quills in its muzzle , chest , and paws			1
prickly : this leopard , pictured at the @entity18 in @entity19 , tried to make a porcupine his dinner the battle commenced and the leopard suffered for its supper by being speared by the quills in its muzzle , chest , and paws in obvious discomfort from the impalement , according to witnesses , the leopard took time out to try and swat the quills from its body with its paws			1
yet the sheer persistence of the leopard and its need for food drove it to ignore the pain and continue its quest			2
eventually , it found a way to pick its way through the quills and subdued the porcupine			2
the unfortunate prickly beast was dragged off into scrubland at the side of a road			2
these extraordinary pictures were taken by @entity47 , 42 , an intensive care nurse at a hospital in @entity49 , @entity50 , when she went on a 12 - day safari to the @entity18 in @entity19			1
hungry : looking for something to eat , the leopard surveys the body of its prey persistence : hungry like the wolf , this leopard ignored the pain and continued its quest to get a bite to eat had enough ? these extraordinary pictures were taken by @entity47 , 42 , an intensive care nurse at a hospital in @entity49 , @entity65 her jeep stopped to allow the party to view the leopard versus food battle on a road between @entity72 and @entity73			1
she said : ' i think the leopard had been chasing the porcupine , which can move quite fast , and it ran out onto the road where the leopard caught it			2
' at one point the leopard was pawing at its own face to try and remove the quills			0
it looked uncomfortable ' it is just nature in action and that is the way it is			0
i was very lucky to see something like this out in the open			0
it is a very unusual sight			0
' a porcupine 's quills are normally off - white and black and are made out of keratin			1
up to 30,000 quills cover the average porcupine which can grow up to 30cm long			0
because of its natural defence mechanism , porcupines do not have to fear being eaten by very many animals			0
but unlike this leopard , three animals have figured out how to eat porcupines			0
bobcats , cougars and fishers , which are native to @entity104 , have learned that a porcupine has no quills on its stomach			0
so one of these predators will sometimes kill and eat a porcupine by flipping it onto its back and biting into its vulnerable belly			0
but few animals know this porcupine - eating @entity118 animals that try to eat them include lions , hyenas and birds of prey , but they are rarely successful			1
and , what do porcupines eat ? a porcupine eats tender bark and twigs , along with other types of vegetation .			0
