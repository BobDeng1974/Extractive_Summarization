however , the @entity12 soft - shell turtle has evolved to use a very different orifice to rid itself of waste			1
most usually encountered at upmarket restaurants in @entity12 , where they are considered a delicacy , these unusual amphibians are the only animals known to urinate through their mouths			1
wash your mouth out ! the @entity12 soft - shelled turtle is the only animal known to science that actually urinates through its mouth now scientists believe that this apparently unique ability helped the animals adapt to survive in swamps and marshes where the water is often brackish - that is , slightly salty			1
scientists in the @entity34 discovered that the linings of the mouths of soft - shelled turtles are covered with tiny , finger - shaped protrusions			1
subsequent research revealed that these allow the turtles to breathe underwater by increasing the surface area of the mouth where oxygen and carbon dioxide can be exchanged			2
but @entity46 of the @entity47 believes that these characteristics evolved for one reason only : to help the turtles urinate through their mouths more easily			0
here are some other @entity12 delicacies that might seem odd to @entity54 diners : together with @entity56 of @entity58 's @entity57 , professor @entity46 kept four turtles in tanks of water for six days , @entity55 reported			1
each animal had a tube attached to its cloaca , the posterior opening where amphibians usually excrete both urine and faeces , so professor @entity46 could keep tabs on what emerged			0
the researchers found that , incredibly , only 6 per cent of the turtle 's urea came out of the cloaca , with the rest mysteriously turning up in the tank 's water			2
professor @entity46 also restrained the turtles on land			0
he found that when he placed a bucket of water in front of them the creatures plunged their heads in for between 20 and 100 minutes			0
observing more closely , he watched as they held some water in their mouths for a while then spat it out , increasing the concentration of the urea in the water			0
delicacy : @entity12 soft - shelled turtles are farmed across @entity94 , where they are considered a delicacy and are often served in upmarket restaurants professors @entity46 and @entity56 found that proteins in the turtle 's mouth lining help to transport urea from its bloodstream			1
they managed to isolate on such protein and found it was only present in the mouth and not the kidney			0
' i know of no other animal that can excrete urea through the mouth , ' professor @entity46 was quoted by @entity55 as saying			2
most fish excrete through their gills , and lungfish and some amphibians can do so through their skin , but the @entity12 soft - shelled turtle 's oral excretion is almost certainly a one - off			1
professor @entity46 believes oral urination helped the turtles adapt to life in brackish waters			2
to excrete urea via their kidneys and through their cloaca they would need to drink a lot of water to flush it through			0
that would mean consuming a lot of salt , which would be difficult for them to get rid of			0
so instead of drinking the backish water , the turtles are able to simply rinse their mouths with it .			0

@entity12 soft - shelled turtle is the only creature to excrete through its mouth
researchers say it evolved like this to survive in brackish swamp waters
