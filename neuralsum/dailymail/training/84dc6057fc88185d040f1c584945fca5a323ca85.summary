not content with backflips or somersaults , this experienced slackliner strips off in mid-air			0
while balancing on a rope with no safety net - and often no harness , @entity7 , from @entity8 , rips off his shirt and pulls down his trousers to reveal his chiselled physique and underwear			1
@entity7 , 22 , has been a slackliner for four years , and travels the world capturing his daredevil stunts in photographs and videos			2
the sport requires intense concentration to remain balanced on an unstable line that is anchored between two points			1
most participants attempt to cross the line without losing their balance , but @entity7 likes to take things a step further			2
the thrillseerker hurls himself into the air , twists and turns , and lands back on the rope - and even he jumps from one slackline to the other			2
but his most impressive trick is surely the strip act he performs in which he kicks off his trainers , whips off his shirt and pulls his trousers down			1
@entity7 said : ' my first clothes off trick was in 2011 , when i did it for the videos and then in competition			1
the trick was taking my shirt off			1
' years later i came back to this idea with the question , ' what other tricks can i do with clothes ? ' ' i had the idea for a long time to take clothes off while slacklining because nobody was doing it this way			2
and i was bored creating just high - level crazy tricks , most slackliners go this way , they try to make the craziest stuff			0
' i wanted to keep doing crazy stunts , but not as dangerous or typical			0
i wanted to be more creative			0
' people 's reaction to this video was wonderful			0
the slackline community liked it as it was something new and fresh			0
' if @entity7 keeps being creative we 'll have to censor the next video			0
