however , reading the small print reveals that after this 30 - day trial ends , buyers will be charged the £ 79 - a - year rate , which includes movie streaming services , among other things			1
the unwitting subscribers were responding to a tweet by food critic and tv personality @entity41 after he discovered he had been charged for the service for two years without using it			2
on sunday he messaged his 164,000 followers saying : ' @entity44 * * * @entity1 ! i ca n't believe you 've been screwing me for £ 79 a year for @entity5 ! i had no idea			1
' i mean , @entity1 offer a free trial in 2012 , then quietly start charging £ 79 and never tell me			1
that 's what sicko porn sites do ! i 've heard ... ' @entity52 columnist @entity41 launched a rant against @entity1 after discovering he had been charged for the prime service for two years without knowing about it initially customers were billed £ 49 per year for the service , but this was hiked to £ 79 in february last year after @entity1 bought @entity59 and included access to it as part of the deal			1
@entity63 , a @entity13 councillor for @entity64 in @entity65 , said : ' i noticed just after @entity66 that they 'd been charging me for it ... for about the last four or five years i think ? ' @entity1 customers can tell if they 've signed up to @entity5 by going to the @entity71 section of the site , located in the top right hand corner of the homepage			1
once there , scroll down the page until you see the ' settings ' section , then look under the ' account settings ' column for a option called ' @entity83 '			0
once you have clicked on that , a new page will open up , telling you whether you are signed up to @entity5 , how long you have been a member , and who is being charged			0
if you want to end your membership , there will be a button on this page allowing you to do this			0
if you think you have been wrongly charged for @entity5 , you can apply for a refund via the customer services page			0
@entity94 , from @entity95 , added : ' i 've just checked and yep £ 79 lighter and did n't even know it			2
i ca n't even remember signing up ! ' meanwhile @entity98 , from @entity99 , said she was ' livid ' after also being caught out			0
mr @entity41 , who has become known for his often savage restaurant reviews and rants against sub-editors of his column at @entity104 , added : ' come on people , check your @entity1 accounts			0
' if you 're being secretly f * * * * * by ' prime ' let me know			0
it 's a class action waiting to happen			0
' @entity1 has long received complaints over its practice of automatically charging customers after the free trial expired , with website moneysavingexpert.com speaking about it back in 2009			1
in recent weeks the @entity115 service has also been attacked for being the most expensive in @entity116 after it was revealed customers in @entity118 pay just £ 7.50 per year for @entity5			2
@entity1 say that the @entity115 prime service includes access to hundreds of movies and tv shows to stream online , as well as online space for storing pictures , and the ability to borrow @entity127 books			2
the @entity115 service also includes free one - day delivery on millions of items , while @entity130 only includes free 2 - 3 day delivery			0
however @entity115 customers are not given the option of taking the cheaper service if they do not want to use all the features of @entity115 prime			0
mr @entity41 branded @entity1 ' highwaymen ' and ' corporate rapists ' after he discovered the charge , which is explained in the small print on @entity1 's website ( right ) an @entity1 spokesman said : ' customers who sign up to a free trial of @entity5 receive an email informing them of the duration of the free trial and how to avoid continuing to paid @entity83			1
' customers who become full @entity5 members can cancel their membership at any time and we will refund the full membership if the customer has not made any eligible purchases or used any prime benefits			0
' so as long as you have n’t used the free delivery , downloaded or streamed any videos through the service , or borrowed a @entity127 book , you can simply cancel the membership and reclaim the subscription			0
' @entity1 did offer mr @entity41 a refund online today after saying he had misunderstood the terms and conditions , but he refused , adding that he was n't asking to be reimbursed , but was informing his followers of the practice .			2
