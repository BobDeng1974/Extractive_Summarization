by @entity0 in @entity1 , afghanistan toiling to defuse deadly improvised explosive devices on the @entity7 frontline , siblings @entity3 and @entity4 really are brothers in arms			1
@entity3 , 34 , is @entity10 ’s bravest bomb hunter			1

he has returned to the warzone to oversee the @entity20 units clearing the homemade bombs strewn across @entity22			2
brothers in arms : staff sergeant @entity4 , left , and his younger brother , warrant officer @entity25 , serve together with 11 @entity26 , defusing improvised bombs in @entity7 no sibling rivalry : but @entity25 , who won the @entity12 , admitted : ' i loved bossing him around ' it is a family affair because the team which thwarts the @entity33 ’s terror tactics includes his big brother @entity34 , 35 , a staff sergeant			1
both soldiers insist there is no sibling rivalry – even though @entity3 , a married father - of - one , is the commander			2
warrant officer @entity38 said : ‘ it ’s sound that we ’re able to be out here together			2
we have a good time			2
family affair : the men 's step - brother @entity44 , 27 , is about to join the regiment too ' @entity34 is my brother , but he ’s also a mega operator			1
i ’ve got no issues whatsoever with his capability			2
‘ the professional answer is every one of my solders is exactly the same and they are treated exactly the same			0
my answer is he ’s my big brother , and i love bossing him around			1
’ @entity55 , a married father - of - three , said : ‘ i ’m the less brave big brother			1
you look round the dinner table – there ’s only one with a @entity12			1
‘ but it ’s not too bad working for him			0
there is a mutual understanding but there ’s still the rank structure			0
’ both men serve with 11 @entity67 ( @entity67 ) regiment , part of the @entity68 , but on this tour of duty they are attached to the @entity71			1
@entity72 won his @entity12 for what was hailed by top brass as ‘ the single most outstanding act of explosive ordnance disposal ever recorded in @entity7 ’			1
on the morning of august 16 2009 , @entity10 troops were taking part in a mission to reclaim a chunk of @entity81 , a @entity33 stronghold in @entity22			1
disaster struck when @entity84 @entity83 , 24 , triggered a bomb			0
as he was evacuated on a stretcher by fusilier @entity88 , 22 , and @entity89 , 18 , they tripped a second blast - killing them both and wounding three more			0
@entity72 was called on to rescue the four maimed soldiers who were stranded in the middle of a minefield			0
without a thought for his own safety , the bomb disposal expert cleared a path across the dusty open ground so the wounded could be evacuated and the dead men retrieved			0
shunning protective clothing to save time , he picked his way across the field dotted with more of the booby - trap bombs			1
keeping his cool beneath the @entity7 sun and with the sound of bullets ringing in his ears , @entity72 managed to dismantle seven ieds - three by simply using his hands			1
@entity4 , left , admitted it was nerve - wracking to be in a room where only one man had a @entity12 honour : @entity25 , now a warrant officer @entity38 , was awarded the @entity12 at @entity121 for a mission in which he disarmed seven improvised bombs to save colleagues without safety clothes his ' utterly selfless action ' allowed the casualties to be recovered			1

five years later , he is in the operations room co-ordinating missions while his brother goes out on the ground			1
they have trained the @entity137 to disarm ieds			2
@entity72 said : ‘ it ’s different because i ’m not out on the ground and @entity34 is one of the operators – he ’s doing the job when i was back out here			1
‘ it ’s a lot quieter now			0
because of the amount of training we have given the @entity7 forces they run their own @entity67 teams now			0
‘ they have taken the majority of the work but we still provide capability when it ’s requested and needed			0
‘ it does give you a sense of satisfaction to know we are leaving this country absolutely prepared to deal with the task in front of them			0
' star soldier : @entity25 in 2009 , before he received his @entity12 , speaking to the then defence secretary @entity164 and home secretary @entity165 ( centre ) in @entity1			1
right , part of the men 's uniform mum 's the word : the men admitted their mother @entity173 , 54 , has had a ' few years ' of worrying about them @entity55 , who is on his third deployment to @entity7 , has seen action during his stint in the warzone			2
on one occasion , he was 1ft from a booby - trap bomb which was protecting an insurgent ammunition dump			0
he was inspired to become a bomb disposal expert after his brother signed up			2
he said : ‘ i spent eight years in the artillery and knew nothing about the job until @entity3 joined the @entity20 and showed an interest in it			0
’ both men admit their trade worries their mother @entity173 , 54			0
and their step - brother @entity44 , 27 , is about to join 11 @entity191 too			2
@entity55 said : ‘ when @entity3 was in @entity7 and i was in @entity192 she was worried and then i came back and i went to @entity7 and came back and now we ’re both here			0
