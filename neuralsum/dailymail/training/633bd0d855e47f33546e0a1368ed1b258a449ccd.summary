by @entity0 follow @ @ laura_mail @entity1 has spoken of his disappointment at missing out on the @entity3 and expressed his desire to represent @entity5 at the @entity6 — even if it is only in the 4x100metres relay			2
the 26 - year - old , the second quickest @entity13 of all - time with a 100m personal best of 9.91sec , was not even considered to pull on an @entity10 vest in @entity11 because he had not raced outdoors before the selectors met on june 2			1
@entity1 missed three weeks of training after suffering a hamstring injury in february and so elected to miss last weekend ’s @entity18 ’s @entity17 and open his season in a ‘ b ’ race in @entity21 , @entity22 last thursday instead			2
reaction : @entity24 looks back after winning his 100m ' b ' race in 10.03secs in @entity21 his winning time of 10.03sec was the second fastest by a @entity31 man this year but @entity24 must still convince @entity31 selectors to pick him over @entity33 for next month ’s @entity6 in @entity34			1
@entity35 junior champion @entity33 , 20 , has clocked 9.96sec in 2014 and competes in his first @entity37 meeting in @entity38 on saturday			1
@entity1 said : ‘ i was eligible ( for the @entity3 )			2
even if i did n’t warrant to go in the 100m at the time i still would have liked to have been part of the relay team but i was overlooked			1
‘ i do n’t know why , you ’ll just have to ask the selection committee , but i would have liked to have been part of a home @entity3			0
‘ i do n’t know about the @entity35			0
that ’s down to the selectors so i just have to wait and see for another week or so			1
‘ i was n’t surprised by @entity50 ’s time			1
we always saw he had potential but he is always one of these athletes that ran a little bit hurt , so it shows what he can do when he is fit and healthy			0
he ran sub- 10 , which is good to see			0
power : the @entity31 sprinter in action during the 4x100m relay at the @entity62 ‘ i ’m happy to represent my country in any form so a vest is a vest and a medal is a medal so yes , i ’d be more than happy ( to go to @entity34 if only selected in the relay )			1
’ @entity24 faced some criticism for skipping last weekend ’s trials , which saw @entity70 win his eighth 100m @entity31 title and gain @entity35 selection in 10.12secs , but he insisted his cautious approach will bring more long - term gain			1
the sprinter ’s career has been marred by injury but the disappointment so clearly etched on his face on thursday showed the shape @entity1 feels he is now in			2
he will compete again next friday ( july 11 ) at the @entity18 ’s @entity31 @entity82 in @entity11 against a much more competitive field , hoping to register a time to really give the selectors something to think about when they meet the monday after			1
@entity1 said : ‘ 10.03sec is my quickest opener to a season so i ca n’t really complain too much			0
‘ i really wanted to compete at the @entity89			0
if they had been this week , i would have competed , but i did n’t want to take the risk			0
‘ my goals are the @entity93 and the @entity94 in @entity95 so i do n’t want to risk any injury that would jeopardise the rest of my career			0
‘ we just did n’t want to take any risks			0
i could have been racing three or four weeks ago but there was a possibility that i could have torn a hamstring so i decided to take the maximum time to recover and be fit and healthy			2
‘ i did miss it , though			0
@entity106 is the whole point and i ’m glad to be back			0
’ winner : @entity24 triumphs in the final of the 60m at @entity113 's @entity112 in february dejected : @entity24 looks on after finishing last in the 100m final at the @entity93 in @entity115			1

@entity118 's time of 10.03secs puts him second in the national 100m *rankings*
@entity123 finished half a second ahead of @entity126 sprinter @entity125
@entity37 event in @entity11 on july 11 is @entity24 's last chance to convince @entity31 selectors to choose him ahead of @entity132
