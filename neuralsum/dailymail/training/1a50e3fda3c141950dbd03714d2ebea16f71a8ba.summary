‘ whatever you do , be careful not to touch them			0
’ our veteran guide ’s warning is very clear as we set off to explore @entity7 ’s most popular show cave in a way that very few tourists have before			1
with the light from his head torch cutting through the darkness in front of us , he ’s referring to the endless number of ancient stalagmites that rise from the floor of western @entity20 ’s spectacular @entity19			1
oil from a human ’s skin can disrupt the growth of the stunning limestone formations , and our guide ’s warning underscores how precious they are and how important it is to preserve them			2
full disclosure : i had no choice but to grab onto a couple of them as i struggled to maintain my balance while trekking through the cave during a challenging adventure tour offered by its operators			2
i tiptoe around the stalagmites as if they were landmines , and between every step i pause to marvel at my surroundings – @entity19 has incredible layers of detail and cavernous galleries that make its visitors feel incredibly small			1
it has taken tens of thousands of years for every scar to develop into a magnificent stalagmite , stalactite , column or curtain – one drop of water at a time			1
the last thing i want to do is stunt their growth as i cautiously crawl under low ceilings and through narrow tunnels , and climb and descend rugged hills inside the cave , which was carved by the @entity78			2
for a greater challenge , visitors who opt for the adventure tour can test their endurance and climbing skills with a number of challenges oil from a human ’s skin can disrupt the growth of the stunning limestone formations known as stalagmites and stalactites an experienced tour guide explains the cave system to a group of visitors before embarking on the adventure tour deep inside the cave , at a depth of nearly 500ft , we extinguish our carbide torches and stand in complete darkness to absorb the cave 's natural sounds			1
it was an eerie yet peaceful experiment as the silence was intermittently broken by the sound of water droplets hitting the floor – an underground symphony that has existed for millions of years			2
moments later , i ’m standing in awe of ‘ @entity114 ’ , a 100,000 - year - old , gleaming white stalagmite that glistens against the glow of my carbide torch			1
this fascinating formation is 16ft tall , and has the appearance of a stack of marshmallows which have been melted and sprinkled it with sugar			1
@entity19 's most popular formation is a 16 - ft tall stalagmite known as ' @entity114 ' , which is an estimated 100,000 years old entering @entity19 in western @entity20 , approximately 31 miles from the capital , @entity127 , is like stepping into an alien world @entity19 has incredible layers of detail and cavernous galleries that make visitors , which number in the thousands , feel incredibly small there does n't appear to be a smooth surface in sight - other than the walkway - in a cave decorated with millions of jagged formations stalagmites : these formations rise from the floor of a cave thanks to constant drips of water containing mineral deposits			1
most have round or flattened tips			0
inside @entity19 , the most magnificent of them all is the 16 - ft tall ‘ brilliant ’ , a gleaming white formation with a thin layer of pure calcite sinter			1
@entity153 : these icicle - shaped formations with pointed tips hang from the ceiling of a cave			1
they are produced as water containing mineral deposits drips through a cave ’s ceiling			2
stalagmites and stalactites form a pillar when they meet			0
curtains or draperies : these spectacular formations form when water trickles down the roof or wall of a cave			1
the sheets of calcite take a wavy shape , just like folded curtains or draperies			0
they hang downward and tend to be very thin , but solid			0
source : @entity179 this fascinating curtain , reflecting in artificial light , formed as water trickled down the roof and wall of @entity19 it was just as magnificent when i revisited it the following day as my group took part in the cave 's normal 90 - minute walking tour that is taken by more than half a million visitors a year			1
with almost 14 miles of passages , @entity19 is one of the world ’s largest karst monuments and one of the richest for limestone formations			1
to reach its depths , visitors are taken on a fun train ride on a mile - long track			2
it is the only cave with a double track railway			2
from the moment the train departs , it is like stepping into an alien world			0
@entity208 and rusty red stalagmites and stalactites twinkle in the light along the illuminated track , which leads to the main tourist section , and the network of tunnels and caverns seems to go on forever			0
to reach the depths of the cave , visitors are taken on a fun train ride on a mile - long track			1
it is the only cave with a double track railway visitors admire stalactites , stalagmites and pillars in a gallery known as the white hall due to the colour of the formations this gallery , known as spaghetti hall , features thousands of string like stalactites which hang from the ceiling the ancient @entity19 was carved by the @entity78 , which runs above and below ground for nearly 18 miles @entity19 is home to about 100 different animals who never leave and live in complete darkness			1
none are more famous or celebrated as the unusual olm ( @entity242 ) , a blind amphibian which has become a symbol of the cave			2
it is known by many names , including cave salamander , baby dragon and human fish			2
with a maximum length of about 11 inches , there are thousands of the creatures within @entity19 , and they were first described by visitors in 1768			1
they can live up to 100 years and are neotenic , meaning adults keep most of their juvenile features			1
aside from human fish , the cave is home to tiny spiders , tiny - neck beetles , water louses and grasshoppers			1
visitors can explore @entity267 , which shows off some of the creatures found within the cave			0
@entity19 's most famous resident is the olm , also known as the cave salamander , baby dragon and human fish there are very few smooth surfaces – jagged stalactites descend like they were driven through the ceiling , while curved stalagmites appear as though they were moulded by the careful hands of artisans			1
visitors on the normal tour – available in 15 languages – have access to about three miles of the cave , including a smooth , half - mile walkway that is wheelchair accessible ( it has no steps but there are some steep inclines )			2
the temperature inside the cave is constant year - round at just under 10 c , meaning most visitors will feel comfortable in a jacket , trousers and trainers			2
@entity19 has been a tourist attraction for almost 200 years since its deeper sections were discovered by @entity301 , a local man , and it was used by @entity303 forces to store aircraft fuel during the @entity305			1
part of the cave was ruined when the fuel was destroyed by partisans , sparking a massive fire that burned for days			0
@entity311 , where three bridges cross the @entity313 , is an extremely busy meeting point in the heart of @entity127 three days in @entity20 after emerging from the cave , i spent my second night touring @entity20 's charming little capital , @entity127 ( pronounced @entity319 ) , just 30 minutes north - east of @entity19			1
with the @entity313 cutting through its lively centre , it lives up to its reputation as one of @entity7 's cleanest and prettiest capitals			1
our guided tour straddled both sides of the river as we passed couples enjoying dinner on restaurant terraces , young friends sharing laughs over drinks , and a mother encouraging her young daughter to dance as a man played traditional songs on the accordion at @entity311			0
it ’s an extremely busy meeting point on this saturday night in a city that traces its roots to an ancient walled @entity343 city			0
