@entity1 ' @entity0 returns with the latest installment of his column for @entity4			2
the @entity6 boss does not hold back with his views on current issues in football and this week reflects on some of the mad happenings during pre-season at @entity12			1
from serie a to the conference we 've had a 21 - year - old @entity17 lad called @entity19 training with us who has been captain of @entity22 's @entity21			1
a few years ago , there is no way any @entity17 would 've even heard of the @entity25 , let alone come on trial for a contract			0
he paid for his own flight and accommodation and is looking for an @entity32 club after being released by @entity22			1
they are two young lads from very different football backgrounds			0
@entity19 from @entity50 champions who were regularly playing in the @entity52			0
and @entity42 who we got from @entity54 when they stopped their youth policy for financial reasons			0
well , @entity19 is a good player and very good technically , but unfortunately i do n't think he will cut it as a 5ft 9ins centre - back in an away game against @entity60 on a tuesday night			1
but @entity42 is a maniac			0
he heads it and boots it and is a fearless warrior			0
contrast : the hive is rather different to the @entity67 , as young trialist @entity19 has found out drilling for ... water it was like a scene from @entity71 at our hive training ground last month			1
we 've had drilling and pumping going on – not for oil , but for water to get the sprinklers on			0
our training pitches were getting dry and becoming difficult to work on for the players			0
so the chairman found a company who brought in a huge drill and set up a tent around it to dig down to some water pipes			1
@entity90 - and - behold , within two minutes of the drill striking @entity89 , it started to rain			1
striking for water ? it 's been like an episode of @entity71 at @entity12 during pre-season off to a flyer there was definitely something in the water on saturday – what a result my @entity6 side beating @entity104 5 - 0 in the first game of the @entity25 season			1
i went in to see the chairman after the game and he hugged me but was shaking his head			1
i asked him what was wrong			0
' i missed the first three goals , @entity1 , ' he said			0
he told me he 'd only arrived in @entity104 10 minutes into the second half due to the traffic on the @entity114 where there was an accident			1
' i saw the fourth goal then the stadium announcer asked for the driver of a black @entity120 to move their car because it was blocking someone in			1
' ' @entity1 , ' he added , ' i missed the fifth goal as i was moving my car ! the biggest away victory in all my time as @entity6 chairman and i 've only seen one goal			1
i ca n't believe it			0
' @entity131 101 since @entity133 left @entity134 last month he has been our vip guest down at @entity6 for quite a few days			1
managers get sacked and forgotten and the phone does n't ring			0
it can be very lonely , worrying and the self - esteem can drop to the floor			1
self - doubt can creep in and you wonder where the next job is coming from			2
@entity144 : @entity0 has been helping out @entity133 since he left @entity145 last month so i got @entity133 in at our place			0
he got the sack at @entity134 after winning promotions at former clubs @entity54 and @entity152			0
at @entity54 , he got a record 101 points to win the @entity154 in 2008			0
hopefully his days out with us will keep his mood up and it wo n't be long before my former @entity158 team - mate returns to football management after his recent shock sacking			2
wherever he goes i 've got no doubt he will build a promotion - winning team			2
fallen at the first hurdle one game into the season – and the @entity166 has n't even kicked off yet – and we have our first man down in the managerial sack race			1
@entity170 paid the price for @entity34 losing 4 - 0 at home to @entity173			1
that is an awful feeling in front of your own fans and it leaves you demoralised			0
however , their opponents @entity173 finished last season very well and will be close to joining the top flight at the end of the season			2
they will spank many teams home and away this season			2
which i guess , when he wakes up this morning with no job to go to , will be no consolation to @entity170			1
gone already : @entity170 has left @entity193 after just one match of the @entity196 season @entity34 sack robins after first game @entity199 , @entity200 , @entity200 as i was driving to work one beautiful sunny morning i saw signs warning of traffic because of a @entity204 festival			1
it reminded me of an old @entity207 track			0
believe it or not he was one of my favourites			0
the last track on one of his cds is called @entity215 which is about @entity204			0
all the way through , he sings : ' @entity220 , @entity221 , @entity222 ' - well , that 's what it sounds like			1
seeing the funny side : @entity226 enjoyed @entity207 's singing of his name one year at @entity230 , we 'd just lost away and were on the coach back			2
our manager @entity226 was n't too happy			0
he was sat on the front seat , so i gave the driver the cd and asked him to play track 20 and turn the volume up all the way			0
i hid in the back corner of the bus as @entity207 rattled out the chorus ' @entity220 , @entity220 , @entity220			0
' we were all in fits of laughter as @entity220 turned around and grinned			0
@entity246 's analysis the player i keep hearing about ... @entity248 have got a great deal for @entity250			1
when i saw @entity252 play at @entity254 's @entity253 on @entity255 i made a note of a young centre - back			1
he was quick , could pass well and was composed on the ball			0
he played with an elegance about him			0
in the last minute of the game , the score tied at 1 - 1 , @entity254 had a free kick			2
they piled everyone into the box for the 40 - yard up - and - under into the mixer			2
@entity250 was there surrounded by bustling @entity254 centre forwards , their tall centre - backs and the big units of the team			1
new club : talented defender @entity250 has moved to @entity248 from @entity252 great business : @entity275 has brought in @entity276 ( left ) and goalkeeper @entity277 ( right ) from @entity252 though the pair are set to remain at the @entity279 on loan for the season ahead as the ball floated in the lad – under pressure from five of them – ignored the carnage , leapt into the air and headed it 30 yards from the goal			1
i circled his name and knew he would be one to sign			0
since then he 's one people keep talking about			2
it 's another great bit of business by @entity275			1
one thing i 'd change about ...			2
with seven subs now sitting on the bench , changes should be made to the rules so that two of those must be homegrown players that have been at the club for at least three years			0
it 's about time changes were made			2
this would hopefully give more opportunities to promote our young @entity32 players coming through			0
on top of that , i think five subs should be allowed to enter the field of play			0
why only restrict it to three , when you 've got seven sitting on the bench ? it 's seems pointless			2
the big issue ... what a nightmare at @entity321 – or is it ? my old hometown club @entity254 were days from going bust towards the end of last season after someone pulled their money out after promises of fortunes being paid into the club			1
they were in a precarious position and after being so well - run over the years it was a shock for all @entity254 fans			2
testing times : @entity321 are a club in crisis as fans protest against hated owner @entity339 scratch team : @entity321 manager @entity341 managed to scramble together a team at the last moment to face @entity252 on saturday well @entity339 , the @entity321 owner , runs a club with no debt , and have put a team together without having to pay players in june and july			1
it 's a smart move			1
rather than the start of summer when players and agents are demanding ridiculous sums , by getting them so close to the start of the season they can call the shots			1
the debts at most clubs in the @entity196 are huge			0
i can understand why @entity321 supporters were getting angry , but you have to ask yourself , do we want to be another @entity365 or @entity366 ?			1

@entity6 boss reflects on another crazy pre-season that has seen trialists from @entity22 and scenes akin to @entity71 at @entity12
but the @entity373 got off to the perfect start , beating @entity104 5 - 0 on opening day ... not that the chairman saw it all
@entity170 has become the season 's first managerial *casualty* after leaving @entity34 ... after just one match
@entity250 will prove an *excellent* signing for @entity275 at @entity248
and is @entity321 's *threadbare* squad actually a smart move by the owner ?
