@entity0 must not be the silent one @entity1 and i had our share of disagreements last season , and this is not me simply having another go at him , but it ’s so frustrating when he does n’t come out and talk after games			1
people say he is being clever and trying to turn the screw on referees			1
he ’s in a panic because he had a bit of a rough spell and saw an eight - point lead over @entity17 disappear			1
there is certainly no campaign against @entity20 from the referees or the media			1
he wants to create an ‘ us against the world ’ mentality because he loves his teams to be the underdog			0
unfortunately , he has a team that is ready to win the league			0
@entity1 was charged by the @entity29 for saying that there was a campaign against @entity20 @entity20 beat @entity32 2 - 0 at @entity33 on saturday and moved two points clear of @entity17 the only people who suffer when @entity0 stays silent are the fans			1
they are the ones who adore him and want to know what he thinks of the game			0
if i was a player , i would be saying : ‘ @entity43 , the fans want to hear from you			2
’ sir @entity45 did it when things were going badly but there are no excuses			0
i ca n’t imagine @entity50 will be too happy either , with @entity0 painting the club in a negative light			0
the current managers , players , ex-players and members of the media - and i include myself in that - are lucky enough to work in an era when tv coverage has brought huge money into the game			0
assistant manager @entity63 stepped in for @entity1 at @entity20 's press conference on friday @entity17 managed to claw their way back level with @entity20 after an eight - point deficit the @entity68 has been good to everybody , so he should have a bit more respect for that			1
the least he can do is oblige the fans who want to hear from him			2
13 - 14 14 - 15 aug - dec 7 8 @entity76 - may 2 6 berahino bonus @entity78 is in demand but @entity80 wo n’t want to let go of his only real match - winner			1
@entity78 has started the past two campaigns on fire , but slowed in the second half of last season , as our table shows			1
this time he has six goals in three games in 2015			1
no wonder he was back celebrating again on saturday			0
@entity78 took his goal tally in 2015 to six in just three matches with his winner against @entity93 @entity78 scored the winner for @entity95 in their 1 - 0 victory over @entity93 at @entity98 on saturday new boss @entity80 got off to a winning start in the @entity68 in his reign as @entity95 manager @entity102 face a @entity104 dilemma @entity102 have a real predicament on their hands			1
@entity107 is out of contract in six months and is a wanted man			1
do the club sell him now and earn a quick buck or hang on and risk losing him for nothing in the summer ? he is a fantastic young player and could be the difference between @entity102 staying up or going down			1
he is a quality striker and , @entity20 or @entity17 apart , he could improve any side in this league			1
he has the work - rate , technique and the temperament to became a top player , and he took his goal against @entity122 so well			0
@entity107 , pictured scoring against @entity122 , is out of contract with @entity102 in the summer with all respect to @entity102 , he is destined for bigger things			1
the big question is when ? @entity128 has a duty to get top money for him but if he helps keep @entity102 in the top flight , that could be worth so much more			1
if they hang on to him now and he keeps them up , then he could happily move on in the summer knowing he leaves with the club ’s blessing			0
@entity136 is starting to make his mark it ’s been a stop - start season for @entity136 , but he did well at @entity140			1
it ’s easy to forget he ’s just 20 years old — the red card in the @entity143 showed his immaturity — but now we are seeing the potential he has to become a top quality player			0
i love seeing players run with the ball with their head up and he does that brilliantly — like a young @entity153			0
he cost £ 20million but he could prove to be a cheap signing in the long term			0
@entity136 scored the winner for @entity157 in their victory over @entity140 on saturday the 20 - year - old @entity160 is starting to make his mark at @entity157 after a slow start following his £ 20m move the price difference between @entity164 and @entity166 's starting xis			1
@entity168 's coup @entity169 talks about three - year plans and needing time to build his squad , but he was taught a lesson on sunday			1
only five players on each side survived from the same fixture last year , so @entity168 has had to rebuild his team just as much as @entity177			1
the only difference is he has done so with greater success and at a fraction of the cost			0
@entity164 manager @entity169 saw his team crash to a 1 - 0 defeat by @entity166 on sunday @entity164 did n't register a single shot on target in their defeat by @entity166 at @entity187 @entity189 's right at home anyone wondering why @entity192 changed clubs only had to look at @entity194 on saturday			1
at @entity32 , the ‘ @entity196 ’ banners were on ice			0
at @entity199 , they would have carried him out of the ground if they could			0
@entity192 got off to a winning start in his reign as @entity199 manager against @entity206 @entity208 's @entity68 number crunching 1,945 - @entity210 's winner against @entity211 was a long time coming for @entity212			1
the left back had not scored a @entity68 goal for 1,945 days			2
on september 13 , 2009 , he scored the first for @entity216 in a 2 - 1 win over @entity218 at @entity219			2
@entity212 scored the winner for @entity210 in their victory over @entity211 at the @entity223 13 - maybe it was no surprise to see @entity192 ’s @entity199 come from behind to beat @entity206			2
@entity192 has won 13 points from losing positions this season , more than any other manager			2
1964 - @entity122 are the first side to lose their opening 10 away games in the top flight since 1964			2
@entity140 were the last team to claim that dubious honour , though they recovered to finish 15th			0
@entity122 players were involved in angry exchanges with their fans after their 10th straight away league defeat 13 - given their reputation as a team of tough defenders , it ’s surprising to see @entity242 have conceded 13 goals from set - pieces , the most in the league			2
45 - @entity246 's assist for @entity248 ’s goal set a @entity68 record for the most by a defender			0
@entity246 beat @entity252 ’s record of 44			0
0 - @entity164 failed to have a shot on target on sunday			2
the last time that happened in the league at @entity187 was against @entity257 in may 2009			0
that 0 - 0 draw won them the title			0
8 - @entity262 ’s red card for @entity140 means they have had eight players sent off since the start of last season			0
only @entity32 with nine have received more reds in the same period			0
maybe it ’s a @entity268 thing ! @entity262 saw red for two bookable offences during @entity140 's defeat by @entity157 on saturday			2

@entity1 is not being clever by not talking after games
@entity20 manager is in a panic because his lead over @entity17 disappeared
the people who suffer when he stays silent are the fans
@entity78 has already scored six goals in just three games in 2015
@entity102 face a real dilemma in whether to sell @entity107 in this window
@entity136 is starting to make his mark after a slow start at @entity157
@entity169 was taught a lesson by @entity168 on sunday
