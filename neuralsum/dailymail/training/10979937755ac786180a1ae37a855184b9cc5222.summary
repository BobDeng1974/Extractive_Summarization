by @entity0 published : 08:24 est , 21 february 2014 @entity2 : 11:58 est , 21 february 2014 there was heartbreak in @entity5 today after the @entity8 all - @entity5 men 's curlers threw in the towel eight ends into a comprehensive thrashing at the hands of @entity13			1
supporters had gathered to watch play at @entity16 , where @entity18 's team train , only to see their boys comprehensively trounced by a rampant opposition			1
@entity8 were forced to play a full eight of ten ends , according to the rules of @entity25 curling , but with @entity18 's team trailing 9 - 3 , the skip decided it was n't worth carrying on			1
backing a losing team : a supporter watching the men 's curling final on television at @entity16 holds her head as she watches @entity13 trounce @entity8 , which trains in @entity16 horror show : fans hold their heads in their hands as they watch the match at @entity40 ice rink , where @entity8 skip @entity41 first learned to play curling playing in their trademark aggressive , muscular style , @entity43 ' @entity13 @entity42 pounced on a string of mistakes by @entity48 to take a 6 - 1 lead after just four ends			1
@entity52 supporters were left praying that the @entity13 would make a mistake , but instead they raced away with the points in a match that was one sided all the way			0
in @entity16 and at the @entity59 curling centre in @entity60 , @entity8 supporters held their heads in their hands as the @entity13 used their muscular style and sharp tactics to successfully block practically all of @entity8 's scoring opportunities			1
elsewhere fans gathered at @entity66 - where curling @entity18 honed his craft - to watch @entity8 win the silver medal			1
there had been high hopes for the @entity52 curling team - made up of four @entity5 - in the final game against @entity13 at @entity60			1
but despite being frozen out 9 - 3 by the @entity13 , their silver was the first medal won by any @entity8 men 's team since the sport 's debut at the 1924 @entity80			1
@entity81 , chairman of @entity82 said the result was still ' a triumph '			0
heartbreaking : playing in their trademark aggressive , muscular style , @entity43 ' @entity13 @entity42 pounced on a string of mistakes by @entity48 to take a 6 - 1 lead after just four ends oh @entity13 : @entity13 's men 's curling team , known as the @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity93 , @entity94 and @entity95 celebrate after beating @entity48 to win the gold medal game at the 2014 @entity97 by end seven , the @entity13 were racing for the finish , playing a tight game to prevent @entity48 's curlers from closing the gap			1
@entity8 had the hammer , but the @entity103 's took every chance to knock away scoring and blocking stones , safe in the knowledge they were benefitting from an almost unassailable lead			2
holding a six shot advantage with just three ends to go all they had to do was make sure they did n't make any mistakes			0
and even the simplest of shots proved elusive for @entity8 the @entity13 had dominated play right from the kick off this afternoon , with blistering shots and masterful tactical play that left @entity8 with few options			1
the @entity42 looked the more likely team from the off , well built and with a professional presence that may have been intimidating for the plucky @entity5			1
beaten : beaten : @entity124 , @entity125 and @entity41 of @entity8 look dejected after losing to @entity13			2
meanwhile @entity126 , right , who watched the final in the @entity59 , shows off her gold medal as play progressed @entity52 brows became increasingly furrowed as the highly practised @entity13 team pressed their advantage again and again , repeatedly smashing @entity52 stones well away from the house			2
at the close of each end , @entity8 skip @entity18 was left with tricky shots to make , but often seemed as though he was trying to hard			2
but while with each advancing end @entity48 's hopes sagged , the @entity13 became more determined			0
@entity18 and teammates @entity140 , @entity124 and @entity141 found themselves with a mountain to climb and , every time they seemed make headway , they once again slipped on the ice			0
after a disastrous first end , the second was more evenly matched , but @entity41 's all - @entity5 rink were unable to come level with @entity151 's @entity42 who made a blistering start			1
the @entity13 , clad in grey and black with their nation 's characteristic maple leaf insignia , dominated the first part of the match , knocking @entity8 's stones all over the ice			1
despite several good moves from @entity48 's skip @entity18 , @entity8 , dressed in white found themselves in a tricky position after just five deliveries			2
focused : @entity94 makes a delivery in a game that his @entity13 team dominated right from the beginning furrowed : @entity48 's skip @entity41 looks grim - faced in his delivery as his team ran out of options the second end was slightly better for @entity8 , but they were unable to overcome the powerful and accurate marksmanship of the @entity13 , despite clawing back a point			1
@entity180 was fast emerging as @entity8 's stand - out player , making the only big shots that really stood a chance of threatening the @entity13 ' dominant performance			1
in the third end it was clear that @entity13 was also benefiting from a large heap of luck , with several poorly delivered shots nevertheless coming in on target			0
at the same time @entity8 's tension was showing , with repeated mistakes practically handing the game away			2
halfway through one awful shot knocked all @entity8 's stones out of the house			0
but in the end @entity13 's bunched up stones proved a tempting target for @entity141 , who was able to knock three reds out of the house			2
@entity48 's skip @entity41 ( left ) barks instructions during the men 's gold medal match at the @entity206 during the @entity207 the fourth end saw a better start for @entity8 with a couple of well - placed guard stones forcing the @entity13 to waste deliveries removing them			1
but despite having the hammer @entity48 's men were unable to press the advantage , eventually losing another point to the @entity13 who gradually tightened their grip on the match			0
a demoralised @entity8 was able to to claw back another point in the fifth end , but in the sixth @entity13 knocked out all the @entity52 stones to score another easy two			2
@entity13 's vice @entity94 shouts during the match , which after three ends was being dominated by the @entity226 lord @entity227 ( left ) with @entity228 ( right ) look nervous as they watch @entity48 slip behind in the the men 's gold medal curling match the @entity226 ' whoops and roars in the @entity59 contrasted markedly with the more conversational , workmanlike approach of @entity48 's all - @entity5 rink			1
the result , in the end , matched the heaviest margin of victory in a men 's @entity25 final			0
after starting the round robin 1 - 2 , @entity43 ' rink won eight straight games to live up to the lofty expectations of a country where curling is the no. 2 sport behind ice hockey			0
after the @entity8 women 's team had lost to @entity13 in their last - four game on wednesday , the pressure had been on @entity18 's boys to take clinch curling glory			1
they were already guaranteed silver after beating @entity257 6 - 5 in a nerve - jangling semi-final , matching @entity8 's previous best medal haul from @entity260 1936 - one gold , one silver , one bronze			1
but a win would have made history by making @entity60 2014 @entity48 's best - ever @entity97 , with a never before achieved two golds			2
@entity125 of @entity48 plays a stone as @entity124 ( @entity268 ) and @entity141 ( r ) assist during the men 's @entity270 match between @entity13 and @entity48 on day 14 of the @entity207 @entity93 of @entity13 ( c ) plays a stone as @entity95 ( @entity268 ) and @entity94 ( r ) assist @entity8 have n't brought home curling gold since the very first @entity97 in @entity275 , @entity276 , in 1924 - a result which was n't officially recognised until 82 years laters			1
first invented in @entity5 , the aim of curling , like bowls , is to get one of four stones closer to the centre of a target than your opposing team			0
it was , then , fitting that @entity48 's men 's finalists all hailed from north of the border			0
@entity18 had told the @entity290 in the run up to today 's curling clash that , despite being the underdogs , he and his team were ready to fight to the very end			2
' that we 're finally here after putting in so much work with these guys is a dream come true			0
we 'll go out there to win the game , our curling match			0
knowing you 've got the whole nation supporting you is just great , ' he said			0
' i hope today goes down to the last stone - we 've won a couple already that went down to the wire			0
we 'll do everything we can , we 'll fight to the absolute last , and hopefully again we 'll have that shot to win			0
' go @entity8 ! : fans show support during the men 's @entity270 match between @entity13 and @entity48 @entity48 were matched against the the @entity13 in the final after @entity43 ' rink beat @entity321 10 - 6 in the other semi-final and on their current form they will fancy their chances			1
@entity257 captain @entity325 had made the first mistake of their sem - final clash with @entity48 's curlers in the second end , too strong with his final shot which gave @entity8 a steal of one point to put them ahead			0
however , the @entity257 responded immediately with two and @entity18 had levelled by the halfway point but having passed the hammer – the final throw of the end – to the world champions			0
@entity41 and @entity338 celebrate after beating @entity257 : the win has clinched them at least silver another mistake by @entity325 with his last throw in the sixth end – he went for a game - changing three instead of the easier one and ended up handing a point to @entity8 – had @entity18 's side back in front again			1
@entity325 again erred in the seventh when his penultimate stone left him only able to level and that suggested that things had turned in @entity8 's favour			0
they forged ahead by one in the eighth			0
@entity257 grabbed a two in the ninth to go 5 - 4 up to set up a tense final end with @entity325 's last throw , slack again , leaving @entity18 a chance for glory by taking a two			2
the @entity8 skip , who had a thrilling last - stone win in the tie - break against @entity366 , was once again bang on target to the cheers of the small knot of @entity52 fans .			0

@entity13 's @entity42 dominated play right from the beginning
they pounced a string of mistakes by @entity8 to lead 6 - 1 after only four ends
@entity18 's all - @entity5 team were unable to fight their way back
they chose to throw in the towel after eight ends to take home silver
a win would have given the best - ever medal haul from a @entity97
