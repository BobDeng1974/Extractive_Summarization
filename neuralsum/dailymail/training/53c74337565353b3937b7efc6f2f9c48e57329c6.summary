thought you kissed goodbye to being marked on your every move the moment you left school or university ? think again			2
new dating app @entity4 has a school - style marking system that gives users letter - based grades depending how how well they present themselves , interact and spell , and on whether they send inappropriate messages			1
the scariest part ? if you fail to get a @entity13 average then you 'll be kicked off the app , or as they like to put it , ' make the grade or be expelled			1
' going back to school ! new dating app @entity4 marks people from @entity20 to a @entity21 , if you do n't make the grade you 're off the app the app 's grade scale ranges from an f to an @entity21 and the aim is to weed out users who are unpopular , unresponsive and inappropriate			1
sign up and you will be marked on three categories ; popularity , responsiveness and message quality			1
popularity is assessed on how often the person is ' liked ' by their fellow users and the quality of their profile , including pictures and a brief description			1
responsiveness checks how often a user is messaging people and how often they get a message back			1
lastly , message quality assesses the characteristics of the missives people send , from whether they make a lot of spelling mistakes to whether they use slang or inappropriate words			1
everyone who is on the app can see your grades with your individual rankings pulled together to make an overall average			1
dating apps are hugely popular with many of us finding love online through services like @entity68 and @entity69 anyone getting @entity71 will automatically be sent advice from @entity4 telling them how to improve their performance in a bid to help them avoid from being expelled			2
the app works in a similar way to @entity68 by allowing users to pull information and pictures from their @entity82 profile in order to create their account			2
however , if you click on someone 's picture and do n't like the grade that you see then you can use the back option , effectively un-doing your ' like '			0
@entity91 , ceo of @entity92 - the company who developed that app , explained : ' although mobile dating apps have exploded in popularity , feedback has painted a picture of horrific user experiences			2
' we believe mobile daters deserve a superior experience and decided to create the @entity4 to eliminate the inappropriate , hostile and undesirable singles that currently taint the mobile dating pool			2
' just like @entity68 if you like someone @entity4 will tell you it 's a match ( left )			0
you will also be told their message quality grade so you have a good idea of what to expect ( right ) the @entity4 first came into conception after a survey of 1,000 mobile dating app users found that a lot of people were unhappy with the services they were being offered and the other people using them			1
the study found that 73 percent of women using dating apps had received an inappropriate photograph and 77 percent had been asked to send nude pictures themselves			0
a huge 90 per cent had received sexually suggestive messages and - most importantly to the makers of @entity4 - an almost conclusive 91 percent said that they wished that there was a dating service that would remove or filter out those types of users			0
an example of how @entity134 works			0
a woman posts a picture of herself and asks a question , men are then invited to answer her recently a number of apps have been launched with a similar intentions to @entity4			0
singled out allows women to have all the control by posing one of 200 questions to their potential suitors , they then have the option to speak with the men whose answers they like			0
mesh is another app that filters messages by picking up on those that swear or use other crude , sexual words			0
then there is @entity161 , which keeps your picture private until you feel comfortable to release it to your match			0
looks like it wo n't be long until creepy online dating behaviour is a thing of the past !			0
