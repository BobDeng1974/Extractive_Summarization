@entity0 believes @entity1 have what it takes to challenge for the @entity4 and maintain their top - four push in the @entity6			1
saints have been one of the stories of the season , with a summer exodus and talk of a meltdown replaced by chatter about @entity16 qualification			0
sunday 's 1 - 0 win at @entity18 proved to the doubters that @entity21 's side are genuine top - four contenders , while another victory by the same scoreline at @entity25 ensured they would maintain a two - pronged attack			1
@entity1 striker @entity0 celebrates after scoring the winner against @entity28 in the @entity4 @entity0 heads back for the restart after scoring only his third goal in all competitions since arriving at @entity32 's saints set up an @entity4 fourth - round tie at home to @entity35 by emerging victorious from their third - round replay against @entity37 promotion hopefuls @entity28			1
@entity0 's impressive first - half strike was the difference in what may have been an ' ugly game ' , but one which keeps alive the @entity6 surprise package 's hopes of a trip to @entity46			1
' it 's only the early stages in the @entity4 now , but i think we 've got a good enough squad to push for that , ' he said			2
' i suppose the first thing is the league , but it would be nice to get some silverware as well			0
' the gaffer gave a few lads on the fringe of the first team a chance and i felt they came in and did brilliantly			0
' @entity62 on the left and @entity64 ( @entity65 ) in midfield were exceptional , and i think it was a chance for them to show the gaffer if he needs them they 're ready to step up			0
' it 's nice for the lads to get a go in such a good cup as well			2
hopefully they can kick on from here			0
@entity76 pounces upon the rebound and converts to hand @entity1 the lead against @entity18 @entity1 players celebrate after taking the lead thanks to @entity76 's strike and held on for an important win ' i think it 's important lads get a run out , 90 minutes here and there , and it 's only good for the squad			1
' @entity0 hopes his performance up front gives @entity21 ' a little bit of food for thought ' if he needs a different option to @entity96 striker @entity95			1
the @entity97 international proved a nuisance throughout and took the winning goal wonderfully , striking first time after @entity102 was tackled			0
' it was just more instinct and sometimes they 're the easiest finishes when it just drops to you and you 've no time to think about it , ' @entity0 said			2
' it was nice to see it hit the back of the net and it took a bit of pressure off us and let us kind of control the game a bit more			0
' it would have been nice to get the second to see the game off , but still it shows good determination from the squad to see the game out			0
' a jubilant @entity21 ( right ) celebrates on the pitch with his @entity1 players @entity21 has been hugely impressive since joining the south coast club during the summer it was a result @entity28 goalkeeper @entity129 found difficult to argue with			1
the 27 - year - old knows @entity1 well , having spent six - and - a - half years at @entity32 's , but he believes @entity28 gave his former club a good challenge			1
' it was probably a horrible game to watch but i thought we tested ourselves well against a top @entity6 side , ' @entity129 told the club 's official website			1
' they scored a good goal but other than that , they did n't really trouble us too much			0
' but that is why they are near the top of the @entity6			2
they have that little bit of quality to win a game			0
' it 's frustrating to have lost but we have to look ahead to @entity153 now and concentrate on trying to earn promotion			2

@entity1 are currently third in the @entity6 table
@entity21 's side beat @entity18 1 - 0 at @entity159
they then beat @entity28 1 - 0 in the @entity4
@entity0 believes they can challenge for the @entity4
but he *suggested* the @entity6 would be the priority
