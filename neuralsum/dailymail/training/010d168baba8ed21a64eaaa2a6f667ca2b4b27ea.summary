by @entity0 published : 04:26 est , 10 january 2014 updated : 04:40 est , 10 january 2014 a simple blood test that gives early warning of heart attacks is being developed by scientists			1
it is hoped that by looking at cells in a person ’s blood the test will distinguish a heart attack waiting to happen from other painful but much less serious conditions			1
those determined to be at high risk of having a heart attack in the next few days or weeks could then be given potentially life - saving treatment			0
the simple blood test that gives early warning of heart attacks measures cells released by fatty deposits often associated with blood clots researcher professor @entity21 said : ‘ there are plenty of other ways to suggest that you are at long - term risk of a heart attack and there are good ways of diagnosing that you have just had a heart attack but what we do n’t have is the ability to say “ you will very likely have a heart attack in the next three weeks and we need to do something about this now ”			1
’ heart disease is @entity39 ’s biggest killer and every seven minutes someone in the @entity39 dies from a heart attack			2
one in three of those who have a heart attack die before reaching hospital			0
the test , being developed at the @entity46 in @entity47 , focuses on cells called @entity49 released when fat that is clogging up and narrowing the arteries cracks			2
a blood clot then seals up the damage , blocking the blood supply to the heart in the process – and causing a heart attack			0
most of the 100,000 heart attacks that occur in the @entity39 each year start this way			1
the @entity47 researchers used blood samples to count the number of @entity49 in the blood – and showed there are more of them in people who have recently had a heart attack			1
the test is quick and relatively inexpensive , and may help save lives in the future by predicting one of the most common forms of death in the @entity39 writing in the @entity77 journal @entity75 , they said : ‘ this first and important validation study shows that we can clearly separate patients with a heart attack from the healthy population			1
’ this paves the way for a study which will check whether the number of @entity49 in the bloodstream can predict an imminent heart attack			2
it is thought that the fatty deposits crack slowly – meaning the telltale signs will be visible in the blood days or weeks before a blood clot triggers a heart attack			1
the rapid and relatively inexpensive test could be used to rule out other causes , including simple things like indigestion			0
those deemed to be at high risk could be put on drugs , including blood thinners			0
a stent could inserted to keep the artery open			0
@entity39 experts stressed that the researchers have yet to show that the technique can pick out heart attacks waiting to happen			2
dr @entity108 , of the @entity109 , said : ‘ these scientists have found that you can detect circulating endothelial cells or @entity49 in the blood of patients following a heart attack , which are not found in healthy people			1
‘ this is an interesting finding and suggests looking for @entity49 could be another way of identifying a heart attack			0
‘ in the short to medium term , it is unlikely to change how people in the @entity39 are treated as we already have good ways to treat and diagnose heart attacks , and targets to ensure rapid treatment times			0
” this study appears to be laying the groundwork for future research to see if this test could be used to identify patients in the early stages of a heart attack			0

heart attacks are one of the most common forms of death in the @entity39
blood clots cause most of the 100,000 heart attacks in the @entity39 every year
the new test hopes to identify whether a person is prone to a heart attack
@entity148 focuses on @entity49 cells released when fatty deposits in blood crack
