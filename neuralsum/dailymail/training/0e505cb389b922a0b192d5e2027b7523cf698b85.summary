after battling the eating disorder for more than three years , her vital organs began to shut down			1

during her tragic descent the aspiring make - up artist kept a diary which lays bare her self - loathing and weight obsession in page after page of harrowing entries			1
at the height of her illness the teenager 's weight plummeted to four stone five years after @entity20 's death from a sudden heart attack in 2009 , her mother @entity28 , 55 , finally built up the courage to open her daughter 's diaries this year			1

mrs @entity20 said yesterday : ‘ at the time i could n’t understand how she ’d lost control of her own body – why she could n’t get better , despite all our worries and fears for her			1
‘ but now , looking through @entity52 ’s eyes , i finally understand her battle			1
i want other sufferers to read her diary and recognise themselves in it , and know just how deadly anorexia really is			1

i ’m scared i really am			2
i do n’t even have the strength to cry			2

her battle against illness began when she was 16 , shortly after she joined a dance school			1
according to her mother , ballet was @entity20 ’s passion			1
but mrs @entity20 , 55 , of @entity77 , north - west @entity78 , said : ‘ one day she came home extremely anxious			1
she said the other girls in class were so much thinner than her			2
‘ she was already slim and pretty			2
she loved living and enjoyed meals with the family , and there was nothing wrong with the way she looked			0
‘ i insisted she was beautiful the way she was , but she just shook her head			0
all girls have confidence issues at some point , but i hoped @entity52 would see sense eventually			0
’ @entity20 began eating tiny portions at mealtimes and tried to conceal the fact her weight was dropping dangerously low			1
' i hate me and my life , ' @entity20 wrote in her diary , revealing her constant battle as anorexia consumed her every thought @entity20 's innermost thoughts show pleas to be thin , and heart - breaking insights into her mind , ravaged by the illness ' i ca n't do this anymore , i hate my body , ' the teenager wrote consumed and tormented by anorexia ' @entity114 is so lovely			1
she is trying so hard with me , but i ’m pushing her away because i do n’t want to gain weight			0

' mrs @entity20 said : ‘ we ’d always been close , but we started arguing every day			1

’ in 2005 , @entity20 was admitted to a specialist treatment centre , weighing less than four stone			1
mrs @entity20 said : ‘ even though she was so frail , she was terrified of going into hospital because she thought she would ‘ ‘ get fat ’ ’			1
’ after a six - month stay , her weight crept up to eight stone			2
but the diaries she kept during that time reveal a young woman facing daily consultations , medical tests and regulated mealtimes who was all the while tormented by deep anxiety over food and body image			2
one entry reads : ‘ i do n’t know how to eat			0
i do n’t know anything			0
all i want is to be and look bony thin			0
’ another reads : ‘ i ca n’t do this any more			0
’ five months after being discharged from the treatment centre , she contracted a mild chest infection , resulting in her losing a small amount of weight – but it was enough to trigger a relapse into anorexia			0
for the next three years she visited various clinics , but the anorexia persisted until her death in 2009			1
mrs @entity20 said : ‘ @entity20 had given me so much to live for , and she was gone forever			1
ms @entity20 said she was inspired to release @entity66 's private diaries in the hope reading accounts of her daughter 's battle with the illness , will help other sufferers after intensive treatment , @entity20 , pictured with her mother , did recover her weight to around eight stone , but a chest infection , which caused her to lose weight , sparked a relapse ‘ i struggled to comprehend why her desire to be thin had taken over her life in such a cruel way			1
’ it was only this year that mrs @entity20 found the courage to open the diary as a way of gaining understanding about @entity20 ’s illness			1
‘ @entity202 occupied her every thought – her entire being , ’ mrs @entity20 said			1
‘ i was devastated to read how she felt as if she hated her life and her body			0
‘ @entity52 thought she could live with the condition – that as long as she was thin , she would be ok			2
