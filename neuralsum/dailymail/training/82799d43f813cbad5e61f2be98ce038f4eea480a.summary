by @entity0 published : 12:50 est , 22 july 2012 updated : 19:53 est , 22 july 2012 refuse collectors have been banned from pulling wheelie bins up alleys because of fears they may suffer a back injury			1
in a decision blasted as ‘ defying common sense ’ , hundreds of residents who for decades have been putting their rubbish outside their back doors have been told it is too risky for binmen to collect			1
householders – many of them pensioners – must now pull the wheelie bins along narrow alleyways near their homes themselves or risk not having their rubbish collected			0
their only alternative is to attempt to trundle the large bins through the inside of their homes to the front			0
' dangerous ' : @entity27 officials believe binmen collecting bins from back alleys like this in @entity32 could give them back injuries residents in @entity32 , @entity35 , are infuriated by the health and safety clampdown , which followed a council risk assessment			1
letters were sent to 287 households to explain that crews could be vulnerable to ‘ musculoskeletal injuries ’ when pulling wheelie bins			1
the residents live in terraced houses with rear gardens that back on to alleyways about as wide as two wheelie bins and up to 87 yards long			1
they argue that in the days of steel bins , crews walked up the alleys to take the dustbins back to the dustcart in the street – and that the job has now been made even easier by wheelie bins			1
however , according to the council , crews are being forced to adopt ‘ awkward postures ’ in the confined space , risking back , joint and limb problems			0
@entity60 , 34 , who lives in one of eight streets that have been affected , said : ‘ i think it ’s absolutely shocking			0
neighbours @entity64 , left , and @entity65 are just some of those who are unhappy about the health and safety rules implemented by @entity68			1
@entity69 , a binman in the fifties from a simpler era of refuse collection			0
‘ that ’s what they get paid to do – move the bins			2
they say they ca n’t move them but we can			0
but what happens if we hurt our backs ? ’ neighbour @entity64 , 65 , who has lived in her house for nearly 40 years , said : ‘ before the wheelie bins came in they used to pick the metal ones up on their shoulders			0
you ’d have thought if they were going to hurt their backs they would have done so then			0
‘ the next thing you know we will have to empty the bins into the lorries ourselves			0
’ it has also been claimed that by getting residents to do the work of pushing bins , the council will need to employ fewer binmen			1
@entity102 , 68 , said : ‘ the bins are on wheels and are not heavy for strong binmen			2
we think that the council is nit - picking to save money			0
’ @entity109 , of the @entity110 ’ @entity108 , said residents had ‘ every right to feel short - changed ’			2
‘ collecting the bins is a basic service which people expect in return for their council tax , ’ he added			2
‘ if binmen have been collecting rubbish from the same place for decades , how can the sudden change be seriously justified ? ' this is another example of health and safety rules being interpreted in an extreme way that defies common sense			1
’ @entity126 , manager of @entity127 , which provides the bin collection service , said : ‘ by asking residents to bring their bins to the end of the lane we can provide a more effective service and keep the lane clear			2
’ the first collection under the new rules went ‘ smoothly ’ , he said , adding that special arrangements would be made for residents who are unable to move their own bins .			1

@entity68 *concerned* binmen will develop ' muscular skeletal injuries ' by collecting bins from back alleys
residents now being asked to move bins further out themselves - even though some have left their bins in the alleys for decades
