nestled in the rolling foothills of the @entity4 , market day in the tiny farming community of @entity2 has never been busier			1
but shoppers are n't there to sample the fresh meat , wine and dairy for which the town is locally famed , they are there to pick up their own piece of end - of - the - world memorabilia			1
this is because @entity16 - has been earmarked by doomsday cults as the only place in the world which is going to survive @entity20 , scheduled for december 21 this year by an ancient @entity22 prophecy			1
now , @entity20 tourists and ufo spotters hoping for salvation are swarming to the two - street hamlet to collect a slice of @entity46 history			1
and it is an opportunity the village 's shrewd inhabitants are eager not to pass up			0
souvenirs include ' authentic @entity52 stones ' from @entity2 's rock - face itself , on sale for € 1.50 ( £ 1.20 ) a gram , and ' natural pyramids of pyrite iron ' from underground			1
meanwhile , a bottle of water from the local spring , which can apparently cure a range of ailments , costs an eye - watering € 15 ( £ 12 )			1
one landowner is even offering up his four - bedroom home with close up views of the mysterious peak for £ 1,200 a night			1
but for those on a budget , he can offer camping space in his field ( tent not included ) for 400 euros a night			1
' i possess a rare asset , the land of immortality , ' he told @entity78 , the area 's local daily			2
emerging market : armageddon tourists can buy ' authentic @entity52 stones ' for 1.50 euro ( £ 1.20 ) a gram while a bottle of water from the local spring , which can apparently cure a range of ailments , will cost an eye - watering 15 euro ( £ 12 ) prime estate : one landowner is offering up his four - bedroom home on the slopes of the mysterious peak for £ 1,200 a night while , for those on a budget , he can offer a camping space in his field ( tent not included ) for £ 324 on the evening in question , tourists can pop to the local @entity100 restaurant for an ' @entity101 ' , washed down with a local vintner 's ' @entity104 ' vintage			1
if the predictions turn out to be wrong , they can celebrate with the same wine - seller 's ' @entity106 ' , on sale a day later			1
@entity109 claimed that on december 21 2012 , a 5,125 - year cycle known as the long count supposedly comes to a close			1
experts estimate the system , which is made up of 394 - year periods called baktuns , starts counting at 3114 @entity117 , and will have run through 13 baktuns , or 5,125 years , around december 21			1
they say 13 was a significant number for the @entity22 , and the end of that cycle would be a milestone — but they have been keen to stress that it does not mark an end			2
conspiracy theorists nonetheless believe the @entity22 may have been privy to impending astronomical disasters that would coincide with 2012 , ranging from explosive storms on the surface of the sun that could knock out power grids to a galactic alignment that could trigger a reversal in @entity134 's magnetic field			1
but @entity136 's mayor , @entity135 , is worried about the numbers of new agers arriving in the town			2
police and troops have been drafted in to deal with the sudden influx and stop believers from scaling the mountain			2
although many believe this is merely a cover for the investigation of dozens of recent @entity149 sightings			0
@entity150 , who quit his telecoms job in @entity153 to move to @entity52 , told @entity154 : ' there are serious things going on here - i want to know what these objects are			2
' things exist and people have a right to know			0
' while @entity150 , who would not reveal his surname , said he was n't sure the world would actually end in three weeks , added : ' i do think the capitalist system is going to collapse then			0
' but others have expressed anger at the town , blaming it for taking advantage of ' gullible ' @entity170			0
@entity171 , the prefect of the @entity172 which includes @entity52 , said this week : ' i find it really outrageous to abuse the naivety of people and rush into commerce that defies common sense			2
' the prophesy is based on an interpretation of the ancient @entity22 calendar which claims an intergalactic planet is on a crash course with @entity134 and will impact on december 21 2012			1
the @entity4 government has even warned of the risk of mass suicides in the country by people who believe the world will self - destruct next year			2
recent disasters - including the earthquake in @entity191 - as well as anxiety over pandemics and economic concerns - are creating a global climate of fear , which for some are omens of impending doom			0
a report published yesterday by watchdog @entity201 said the picturesque village near @entity204 should be monitored in the lead - up to the end of 2012			2
@entity201 president @entity207 said : ' i think we need to be careful			0
we should n't get paranoid , but when you see what happened at @entity212 in the @entity213 , we know this kind of thinking can influence vulnerable people			0
' the internet is awash with myths about the hamlet			0
these include beliefs that the mountain is surrounded by a magnetic force , that it is the site of a concealed alien base , or even that it contains an underground access to another world			2
doom : an ancient @entity22 calendar , which is made up of 394 - year periods called baktuns panic : the prophesy is based on an interpretation of the ancient @entity22 calendar which claims an intergalactic planet is on a crash course with @entity134 and has spread panic across the world @entity238 , who runs an organic cafe in the village , said there have been an increased number of reports by walkers in the area of cameras jamming when they tried to take pictures and strange noises rumbling underground			1
' we have seen military aircraft , police and soldiers , ' he added			0
' it ’s like a @entity255 movie			0
they are looking for something			0
there is something in this mountain , definitely			0
' meanwhile , panic is spreading throughout @entity262 at such a rate over the @entity134 's pending doom , that @entity266 ’s minister of emergency situations has told its citizens that the world will not end on december 21			1
@entity109 claimed that is the day a 5,125 - year cycle known as the long count in the @entity22 calendar supposedly comes to a close			1
many in @entity262 , where mystical thinking is popular , have taken notice			0
some are hoarding everyday items such as sugar , matches and candles , while inmates in a jail are said to have experienced a ‘ collective mass psychosis ’			0
the ministry said it had access to ‘ methods of monitoring what is occurring on @entity134 ’ , and could say with confidence all will be well			0
however @entity262 were warned they still face the threats of ‘ blizzards , ice storms , breakdowns in heat , electricity and water supply ’			0
an official from the @entity262 @entity299 has also spoken out to reassure frightened people .			0
