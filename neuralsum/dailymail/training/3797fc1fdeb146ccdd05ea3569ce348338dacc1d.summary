by @entity1 showbusiness correspondent he was one of @entity3 ’s best - loved comedians , not to mention a favourite of the @entity5			2
but @entity7 ’s legion of fans may struggle to see the funny side of a new drama film – which depicts the legendary fez - wearing entertainer as a violent alcoholic			1
@entity7 : not like that , like this will be broadcast on @entity15 on monday evening to mark the 30th anniversary of the star ’s death			2
@entity20 , as @entity7 and @entity21 , who plays his wife @entity22 , feature in a new film about the comic 's private life but rather than focus on his career , the two - hour biopic concentrates on his 17 - year affair with his assistant @entity30 , his battle with alcoholism and episodes of domestic violence			1
the drama , written by @entity36 who penned 1990s sitcom @entity38 , stars shameless actor @entity20 as @entity7 , and is the most high - profile film to focus on the comedian ’s private life			1
in one scene , @entity7 and his wife @entity22 , who is played by actress @entity21 , are shown having a drunken brawl in the street after she suspects he is having an affair – during which he is shown punching her in the face			1
later in the programme his mistress is shown with a bruise on her cheek after refusing to give him more alcohol after a night of heavy drinking			2
however , both @entity36 and miss @entity21 have defended the film , saying it is ‘ respectful ’ to @entity7			1
comedian and magician @entity7 , pictured with his wife @entity22 it is also understood that the comedian ’s daughter @entity60 helped with the research for the drama , and gave it her blessing			1
@entity36 said @entity7 ’s violence towards his wife and mistress , along with his reputation as a big drinker , are all well - known			1
asked if he felt any reservations about including the scenes of domestic violence because of the comic ’s status as a national treasure , the writer said : ‘ it ’s on record , it is not something that we invented			1
so i hope that we did it in a delicate way and did n’t make it unnecessary			2
‘ you do n’t want people who do n’t know @entity88 ’s comedy to go away thinking he was a wife - beater			0
but he was physical , and he was physical with his wife , who gave as good as she got			0
the @entity15 film marks the 30th anniversary of @entity7 's death ‘ so that relationship worked and he did try to replicate that in a way with @entity30 , and she was n’t the same person , so it looked actually worse than it was			1
‘ @entity100 was obviously a huge influence , and although he got very good at handling his drink , the quantities were enormous			0
’ @entity7 died of a heart attack live on stage in front of millions of viewers , during a performance on the @entity110 variety show at @entity111 in 1984 , when he was aged just 63			2
during his career he developed an alcohol problem while struggling to deal with stage fright			0
miss @entity21 , 56 , said she hoped the drama will not upset the comedian ’s fans , adding : ‘ we ’ve tried to be respectful and not dishonour @entity88			1
we see the stress the man was under and the fact that he did indeed love two people at the same time			0
it might be hard to grasp , but he did			0
‘ some viewers may be quite shocked by this and think , “ i ’m seeing him in a new light ” , but that would be a shame			0
‘ it does n’t detract from what he was to the public – one of our greatest comedians			0
’ @entity134 , who runs the @entity135 , said yesterday : ‘ the film will obviously be dramatised			2
i have n’t seen it , but i do n’t think they needed to go down that road			0
‘ they could have celebrated his life and career , which saw him become one of @entity3 ’s highest - paid entertainers			0
he was a favourite of the @entity5			0
