@entity83 - @entity104 @entity11 despite being just 24 years old , @entity83 has already racked up a cv impressive enough to rival that of her other half , @entity109 and @entity2 star , @entity11 , 25			2
a singer , songwriter , tv presenter and model , the @entity111 - born beauty started her career at the tender age of 11 when she won @entity118 , an @entity119 tv talent show with the song , @entity121			0

she even found time to compete in @entity129 - the @entity26 version of @entity131 - in 2012 , although failed to take home the top prize			0
stars : although little known in the @entity137 , model @entity135 , left , is as famous as her footballer boyfriend in @entity2			1
@entity139 , right , used to be a tennis pro impressive : @entity139 retired in 2012 at the age of 27 but not before managing to cause an upset by beating @entity143 at @entity144 in 2009 @entity139 - @entity145 the @entity147 other half of @entity148 midfielder @entity145 , @entity139 , 29 , enjoyed a successful tennis career until retiring in november 2012 , aged 27			1
during her career , @entity139 and her doubles partner @entity150 racked up an impressive tally of wins - eventually becoming world number ones and triumphing in the @entity156 and @entity157 @entity155 among others			2
less impressive was her singles career , in which she enjoyed a relatively modest amount of success and a top @entity157 ranking of number 26			0
nevertheless , @entity139 did manage to pull of a series of impressive upsets - most famously , when she beat @entity143 in the second round of @entity144 in 2009			2

@entity226 , also 26 , has been dating the footballer since 2011 and is a successful journalist in her own right			2
that , however , might not be enough to compensate for the lose - lose situation in which she will find herself come sunday when her man takes to the pitch against her home team			0
@entity214 - @entity216 one of the most glamorous wags on the @entity6 circuit is @entity214 , the statuesque girlfriend of @entity215 and @entity2 midfielder , @entity216 , 27			1

@entity276 - @entity256 the world of @entity34 has no shortage of model members but @entity255 , the 24 - year - old wife of @entity202 's @entity256 , is certainly not your average model or , indeed , @entity283			2
her passion is horses and like her husband , she 's no stranger to competitive sports and has a career in dressage to her name as well as a stable of steeds at the couple 's home near @entity295 .			0
