trading blows and brawling in the grass , two brown bear cubs go paw - to - paw in a play fight - leaving their other sibling to play the role of referee			2
as the cubs fought one another in the enclosure at @entity14 's @entity13 , their mother had time to fish for dinner			1

' i really wanted to visit this zoo , since it was the first zoo to create fenceless enclosures where animals are divided from visitors not by wire or cages , but only by natural or hidden obstacles , in an almost natural environment			0
rest : the two cubs take a nap on their mother after finishing their exhausting play fight snooze time : the cubs curl up with their mother , sprawled out on the grass , after brawling in the zoo dinner time : while the cubs were busy trading blows , their mother fetched fish for their dinner break : one of the bear cubs takes refuge on a branch after fighting with her fellow cub in the zoo enclosure ' i knew that little bear cubs can be overly excited , so i did n't have to wait long for them to start playing			1
' the @entity69 brown bear is a sub species of the brown bear , and is the largest sub species in @entity114 and @entity115			0
despite their imposing size , these bears are generally not dangerous to humans , and only one per cent of encounters result in an attack .			0
