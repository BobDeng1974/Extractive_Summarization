the @entity0 will have to drive @entity1 and @entity2 back to @entity3 without @entity5 riding shotgun			1
instead , she 's flying coach and toting her own luggage			0
a @entity10 regional jet carried her back to the @entity11 on thursday from the @entity12 , @entity13 airport			1
her flight was bound for @entity15 , @entity16 , the major airport most convenient to her spacious @entity3 , @entity18 home			1
a reporter with the liberal news outlet @entity21 tweeted a photo of @entity5 toting her own luggage on thursday in @entity12 she 's just like @entity23 ? a town car sedan ( right ) met mrs. @entity5 on the tarmac in @entity15 on thursday , flanked by police and @entity0 vehicles @entity5 took the fast route home from @entity30 to the @entity11 : just a 3 - hour flight instead of 20 hours of driving time @entity5 had just finished a three - day presidential campaign swing in @entity33 , @entity30			1
that 's just a few miles away , and home to a cafe where she held a top - secret meeting with @entity40 insiders who were told to surrender their cell phones and cameras beforehand			0
in contrast with the private jet service @entity5 has been accustomed to on her storied and lucrative speaking tours , her ride home was a no - frills commercial flight without a @entity51 seat to be found anywhere			0
for flights from @entity12 to @entity15 , @entity10 uses @entity54 and @entity54 jets with nothing but narrow economy - class seats			2
@entity58 ? @entity1 's first trip ended with a total of 10 confirmed sightings and more than 1,300 miles driven @entity5 flew back east on an @entity54 - series plane like this one easier to rub @entity63 : the aircraft mrs. @entity5 took home has narrow chairs and the whole plane is economy class , but at least there 's no middle seat @entity5 's handlers have been trying to reposition her as an ' everywoman ' eager to meet with ordinary people			2
but her first @entity30 event , promoted as a spontaneous coffee shop sit - down with average voters , turned out to be a carefully staged production whose young participants were driven to the cafe by @entity5 's @entity30 political director			2
at least three of the ' everyday @entity23 ' featured in @entity5 's campaign launch video have ties to @entity40 politics			2
and hours before her flight , @entity0 agents parked the now - familiar ' @entity1 ' van in a handicapped spot so she would have a shorter walk			0
on thursday a @entity92 reporter photographed @entity5 at @entity12 's @entity94 airport , holding on to her own rollaboard luggage and talking with a member of the public			1
but while she boarded the plane like everyone else , she did n't disembark that way : @entity102 passenger tweeted a photo of the @entity105 sedan – and police escort – that awaited her in @entity15 on the airport tarmac			1
just one person tweeted that @entity5 was on their plane , not unlike her @entity113 lunch at @entity114 where no one recognized her embarrassing : @entity0 parked ' @entity1 ' in a handicapped space thursday while @entity5 held a top - secret meeting with @entity40 officials it 's not clear how @entity5 's twin ' @entity121 ' vans , her armored and customized campaign vehicles , will get back to @entity3			1
the @entity0 did not respond to a request for comment			0
agents will likely have to drive the vehicles back themselves			0
if @entity5 were the @entity23 president , they would be rolled aboard @entity129 and flown east			0
but that will have to wait at least until january 2017 .			0

@entity10 flight 3954 carried @entity5 from @entity12 , @entity13 to @entity15 , @entity16 on thursday
@entity135 by a @entity105 and a police escort – on the tarmac – for what 's likely a short trip back to her @entity3 , @entity18 estate
follows @entity30 campaign swing full of controlled **interaction*s* , staged *conversations* and little *interaction* with real people
@entity5 was , however , photographed pulling her own *suitcase* down an airport *concourse*
