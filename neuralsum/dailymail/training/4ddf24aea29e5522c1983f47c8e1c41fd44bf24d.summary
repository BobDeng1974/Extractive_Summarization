new shirt will cost fans a staggering £ 90 alone @entity2 will play in an all - white home strip classic 1966 red look for the away number by @entity6 follow @ @ mattylawless @entity8 's @entity7 believes @entity9 must take @entity10 to the @entity11			1
@entity12 will be looking to end 48 years of hurt wearing these new @entity2 kits in @entity15			1
@entity8 can reveal the home and away shirts that the @entity2 will walk out in at the @entity11			1
both are designed with a classic look to inspire @entity9 's men as they face a difficult test in @entity22			0
@entity12 was joined by @entity10 as the @entity24 midfielder continues to enjoy a breakthrough season , @entity27 's @entity26 , currently sidelined with a broken foot , @entity30 's @entity29 and @entity27 midfielder @entity26			0
@entity2 face tough group games against @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34 in their bid to go on to be crowned world champions for only the second time in history , ending the wait since their triumph in 1966			1
the navy blue shorts have been ditched with @entity2 following the likes of @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity32 and holders @entity83 , who will all wear all - in - one themes for their home kits			1
the red away kit , however , is separated by white shorts and red socks to complete the traditional 1966 look			1
@entity2 's new all - white number will be worn for the first time at @entity94 against @entity95 on may 31 , before the final 23 - man squad departs for @entity97 for two @entity11 warm - up fixtures against @entity99 and @entity100 , and then onto @entity101 where they will be based in @entity15			1
' i 'm always proud to put on the @entity2 kit and with these ones it 'll be no different , ' said @entity12			2
' i ca n't wait to get out to @entity15 and play in them this summer			0
' home and away : the new strips boast @entity109 's dri - fit technology , which has mesh and laser - cut ventilation holes , to aid performance by helping regulate body temperature on the ball : @entity12 dons the new @entity2 strip , and right , @entity116 and @entity117 ahead of @entity2 's clash against @entity15 in the 1970 @entity11 the home shirt is said to be inspired by the 1970 @entity11 kit worn by legends @entity116 , sir @entity122 and sir @entity123 in @entity124			1
but a distinctive v - neck collar gives the shirt an identical look to the 1954 design sported by @entity129			2
there is an engineered pinstripe in the fabric on the latest number with a white satin tape on the shoulders to create a shine - a theme displayed throughout the strip			1
the gold 150th anniversary @entity2 crest is replaced with a metallic weave , added to create a shimmering effect that kit makers @entity109 say is most noticeable when the crest catches the light			2
inside the back of the neck is a pennant tab with a graphic of silver pinstripes that together create a @entity151 's cross			0
and the shorts also have a satin white tape along each side to create the same shine as the shoulders of the shirt			2
' two references really stood out during the design process for the home kit – that stunning all - white kit @entity2 wore in @entity124 in 1970 and the idea of the armour of @entity164 , ' said @entity109 's global design director @entity165			1
' you can see subtle references to the armour in the pinstripe , which carries a hint of shine , and the white satin tape on the shoulders			0
' we wanted to add some small detail that echoed the glow of the armour worn by @entity151			0
' the away jersey features a bold red tonal pinstripe design subtly infused with a graphic interpretation of a @entity151 's cross on the front and has a unique neckline with a grown on collar			0
the shorts are white with a red tape along each side and the socks are red			2
the cross on the shirt , however , is an optical illusion and can not be seen up close , only coming into focus from further away			0
red alert : the away jersey features a bold red tonal pinstripe design subtly infused with a graphic interpretation of a @entity151 's cross on the front same again please ! this tournament 's design is identical to that chosen for the @entity2 side at the 1954 @entity11 - worn here proudly by captain @entity129 ' the red jersey has been an icon since @entity2 won the @entity11 wearing it 1966 , ' added @entity165			1
' as they prepare to compete this summer we wanted to pay tribute to their storied history while updating the kit with several contemporary design details			0
' the players were said to be pleased with the new designs after modelling them for the first time at @entity2 's @entity212 hotel base before the win over @entity214 last month			2
both kits boast @entity109 's dri - fit technology , which has mesh and laser - cut ventilation holes , to aid performance by helping regulate player body temperature over the course of match			0
indeed , this will prove helpful in the jungle - climate of @entity225 , where @entity2 face @entity32 in their opening @entity11 match on june 14			1
but some fans and parents alike are unlikely to award their seal of approval , barely a year after the last set of kits were launched			0
out with the old : @entity2 wore the previous white strip just seven times after it was debuted against the @entity236 at @entity94 last may @entity2 wore the previous white home strip just seven times after it was debuted against the @entity236 at @entity94 last may			1
the red away kit was only seen in two games since its unveiling 10 months ago , against @entity15 last june and in the 0 - 0 draw with @entity242 last october			2
it could be the same case this time too , with the kits labelled ' for 2014 ' , suggesting there will be another release in 2015			0
the @entity247 refused to hide their angst last year and are likely to be furious again with an adult match replica shirt costing a staggering £ 90			1
a replica version is charged at £ 60 while youth shirts will cost £ 42			0
' we would advocate the kit manufacturers put use by dates into the garment 's label			0
' that way fans who fork out for a kit at least know exactly what they 're getting			0
' but if @entity9 's men manage to lift the trophy in july , the new kits will prove to be worth every penny - and a guaranteed collectors ' item			0
got your number : @entity109 collaborated with renowned @entity272 typographer @entity271 to create a new font for the names and numbers on the back of this @entity2 jersey the @entity2 home and away kits are available to pre-order on nike.com from march 31 , and on sale in stores and nike.com worldwide from april 3 .			1
