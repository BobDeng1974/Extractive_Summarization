by @entity0 a mother fighting cancer can not hug her three children because her treatment has made her radioactive			1
@entity5 , 27 , has taken high doses of iodine as part of her treatment for thyroid cancer			1
this meant she had to be placed in isolation at the hospital , with staff banned from going within three metres of her for five days			0
for three weeks she had to stay at least two metres from the children meaning she had to watch from a distance while her husband , @entity18 , played with them however , she says that life has been even more frustrating since she was allowed home			2
she must avoid her six - year - old daughter and one - year - old twins for three more weeks , as bodily contact could cause them lasting damage			2
‘ it is very hard because the twins are too young to understand , ’ said mrs day			0
‘ my oldest daughter saw a cancer psychologist who explained to her that my treatment was necessary , and she understands why , because it ’ll make me better			1
support : husband @entity33 and children at their home in @entity36 in @entity37 mrs day had to take high doses of iodine as part of her treatment for thyroid cancer			1
this was the second time she had fought cancer as she suffered from leukaemia as a child ' i breast - fed my twins for about five months after they were born , and i ’m not used to being away from them			2
i ’m missing them so much			0
‘ i thought it was hard in hospital , but it is so much harder now because i can see them but i know i can not touch them or cuddle them or go near them			0
‘ i ca n’t cuddle anybody at the moment , and it ’s heartbreaking			0
‘ i have to navigate around the house while keeping a safe distance from my children			0
‘ we are a very close family and three weeks seems like such a long time , but it will be worth it			0
’ it is mrs day ’s second battle with cancer			0
she overcame leukaemia as a child			0
mrs day ( pictured with her husband , @entity18 , and their eldest daughter on the couple 's wedding day ) was diagnosed with thyroid cancer after finding a lump in her throat fighter : this is the second time that @entity5 pictured with her husband and daughter on her wedding day has battled cancer , after she was diagnosed with leukaemia as a child she had now been given the all - clear and can cuddle her children again - she will have another scan in six months time to ensure that the cancer has not returned tough : @entity5 must stay at least a metre away from her three children for the next three weeks she was diagnosed with thyroid cancer in january after seeing a doctor for a lump in her throat			1
she initially thought she had a swollen gland , but doctors at @entity105 soon realised the growth was cancerous after an operation to remove half of the lump			0
for her particular type of cancer , patients receive radioactive iodine treatment – a form of internal radiotherapy			1
the treatment involves a radioactive form of the element called iodine 131 , administered as a drink or capsule , which circulates throughout the body in the bloodstream			1
thyroid cancer cells pick up the iodine wherever they are in the body , and the radiation kills them			1
other cells are left unaffected , because only thyroid cells take up the iodine			1
she says that being home with her family in @entity36 - but unable to go near them - is in some ways worse than when she was on her own in hospital while she was in an isolation unit in @entity138 , staff were not allowed to go within three metres of her for five days @entity5 's husband @entity139 has now taken a month off work to care for their three children			1
she said : ' i ca n't cuddle anybody at the moment , and it 's heartbreaking			0
i have to navigate around the house while keeping a safe distance from my children ' the treatment rendered mrs day so radioactive that anything she touched in hospital has been thrown away			2
while the powerful treatment is also dangerous to the patient , the risk from the cancer itself is judged to be greater			2
the mother of three , from @entity36 , said the thought of holding her children in her arms again has given her the courage to go on			1
she said that , during her time in hospital isolation , she received support from dozens of people who followed her online blog and kept in touch with her via phone			0
‘ i have had so much support – it ’s amazing , ’ she said			0
‘ now i just ca n’t wait to get back to normal and hug and kiss my children again			0
’ radioactive iodine treatment is a type of internal radiotherapy			1
the treatment uses a radioactive form of iodine called iodine 131 ( @entity181 )			1
the radioactive iodine circulates throughout the body in the bloodstream			1
radioactive iodine treatment is a type of internal radiotherapy , administered as a capsule or drink thyroid cancer cells pick up the iodine wherever they are in the body			1
the radiation in the iodine then kills the cancer cells			2
radioactive iodine is a targeted treatment			1
it does n't affect other body cells , because only thyroid cells take up the iodine			2
the treatment is usually administered as a drink or capsule			0
patients having radioactive iodine treatment in hospital are looked after in a single room until their radiation levels have fallen again			1
the treatment causes the patient to be slightly radioactive for a few days , so time spent with staff and visitors is minimal			2
sweat and urine also become radioactive , so bedsheets are changed every day and patients have to flush the loo more than once			0
pregnant women and young children will not be allowed to visit			0
even 12 weeks after treatment , patients who have had radiactive idodine therapy may set off radiation alarms at airports .			0
