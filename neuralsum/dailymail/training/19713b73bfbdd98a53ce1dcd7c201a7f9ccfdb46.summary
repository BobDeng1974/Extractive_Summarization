a social housing resident has been booted out of his home over his litter - strewn and overgrown back garden			1
@entity5 's backyard had bags full of ' rotting smelly rubbish ' and was covered in pieces of plastic sheeting and broken fencing			1
his lawn was also overrun with brambles while a broken basketball hoop had been propped up against the against a fence and an old table and chairs were almost hidden underneath the pile of black bags			2
the 47 - year - old had been warned two years ago to clean up his overgrown plot but social housing bosses lost patience after making a surprise inspection			1
@entity5 has been kicked out of his home for having this overgrown and untidy garden @entity24 ( @entity24 ) , which runs council housing in the city , booted @entity27 out of his semi-detached house in @entity29 , @entity30 , two weeks ago			1
the eviction was the first in the city for over seven years and the social housing group had to get in professional cleaners to clear the garden and wash the interior			2
@entity24 had successfully applied to @entity38 for an @entity39 against @entity27 , claiming he had persistently breached his tenancy agreement which states residents must ' make sure their gardens are maintained , tidy and free of rubbish '			1
@entity45 , director of housing at @entity24 , said : ' our tenancy agreement is very clear that the customers are responsible for maintaining their gardens			2
' mr @entity5 's failure to act left the judge with no option but to conclude that it was unlikely there would be any improvement in the condition of the garden , so he granted us an outright possession order to evict mr @entity5 from his home			1
' residents on the well - maintained @entity59 estate yesterday expressed their relief @entity27 had been given his marching orders			2
the 47 year - old was warned two years ago to clean up his act but when inspectors from @entity24 conducted a surprise visit , they found the garden in a state neighbour @entity68 , 43 , said : ' it was horrible to live next to			1
' at first glance it was just brambles but if you looked closer you could see that there was furniture buried under bags of rotting , smelly rubbish			1
' i ca n't imagine how they lived in there			0
if the outside looked like that and they were dumping rubbish out i wonder how jammed full the inside must have been			0
' @entity86 , 23 , who lives three doors down from the property , added : ' you did n't really see him much , i ca n't imagine they would have shown their face often to us knowing the state of that garden			0
' it was an eyesore , i just hope someone will be brought in who looks after it better			0
' maybe they need some help now , if they had a warning two years ago and still could n't help themselves you wonder if there 's a bigger issue			1
' @entity108 , 22 , who rents a bedroom in a nearby house , said : ' that ca n't have been nice to live next to			0
' i know for most people looking after a garden is n't a top priority , but that 's just ridiculous			2
' and shop worker @entity116 , 27 , added : ' that does look out of order , but i do n't know if kicking someone out of their home for that is a bit extreme			0
' @entity124 have expressed their relief at @entity27 's eviction who had let his garden become overgrown and litter strewn the garden has now been restored after a team of cleaners cleared the rubbish and cut back the overgrown brambles and hedges			1
local councillor @entity136 said : ' gardens that are left completely neglected have an impact on other residents and bring down the area			0
from time to time we get feedback from residents in @entity59 and they ask for more robust action in serious cases			0
' one neighbour on @entity147 said : ' i noticed it did n't look great when i cut part of the hedge down but it did n't smell or anything like that			0
' and another resident added : ' you did n't notice the problem because of the high hedges but these pictures do look pretty bad			0
' @entity24 had served mr @entity5 an injunction in december 2012 compelling him to clean up the garden but when he failed to do so the county court issued an @entity39			1
a spokesman said : ' despite assurances to @entity24 officers that he would make improvements by required deadlines , he did not stick to these timescales or made little or no improvement to his garden			2
' the agreement all tenants sign up to states that they agree to be responsible for making sure their gardens , yards and hedges are maintained , tidy and free of rubbish at all times			0
' this includes grass , plants , bushes , hedges and trees			0
