@entity1 should be replaced with an ' empty chair ' if he refuses to take part in tv election debates , @entity0 said today			1
the @entity6 leader accused the prime minister of ' running scared ' of taking him on in a live show down alongside @entity9 and @entity10			1
it comes after mr @entity1 ruled out taking part if @entity14 leader @entity13 is left out			1
mr @entity1 has insisted that the format being suggested by broadcasters was unfair because it includes mr @entity10 but excludes the @entity17			1
the @entity6 leader this morning ramped up the rhetoric , calling on broadcasts to go ahead with the debates with or without the @entity32 leader			1
mr @entity0 told @entity33 's @entity19 : ' i think it is pretty disreputable that @entity1 went into the 2010 election saying that these debates were the most important thing that we could possibly have and people should n't make feeble excuses to get out of them , and he is doing precisely that			2
' he is running scared of these debates			1
i want these debates to happen , i think they should happen with @entity1 or without @entity1			2
' mr @entity0 told @entity19 @entity1 was ' running scared of these debates ' , adding : ' i want these debates to happen , i think they should happen with @entity1 or without @entity1 ' @entity1 ( left ) , @entity9 ( centre ) and former prime minister @entity50 ( right ) took part in the final live leaders ' election debate , hosted by the @entity33 in the @entity54 of @entity55 on april 29 , 2010 the @entity6 leader added : ' in the end that 's a matter for the broadcasters , but i do n't think any one political leader should be able to stop these debates happen , should be able to veto these debates , block these debates			1
' if an empty chair represents @entity1 in these debates , so be it			2
i think these debates need to happen			0
they are owned by the @entity69 people , not owned by @entity1 or anybody else			2
i think , frankly , the prime minister should stop ducking and weaving , trying to avoid these debates			2
' under plans put forward by the major broadcasters in october , the prime minister would take on mr @entity0 alone in one debate , with another featuring the three mainstream party leaders and a third also including mr @entity10			1
@entity78 chairman @entity22 has said voters will think that @entity1 is ' frit ' if he dodges live tv debates with other party leaders lord @entity22 's comment that mr @entity1 risks looking ' frit ' is a clear reference to @entity87 's 1983 taunt to then @entity6 deputy leader @entity88 that he was scared of a general election			1
the @entity32 peer told @entity91 : ' i do n't think it is going to improve his image			2
i think the public will take the view that he is frit			0
' and anyway , the public enjoy these confrontations			0
it is obviously going to be the most awful election campaign that anyone can remember , so to rob it even of this little bit of show , i think , would not be particularly pleasing to the public			0
' it would certainly provide the opportunity for the other parties to say , ' what is wrong with him ? why does n't he want to do it ? ' and for the more sophisticated audience , they will whisper quietly that the reason is that he bungled it in 2010			0
' mr @entity1 took on @entity9 and @entity6 prime minister @entity50 in the @entity69 's first ever general election leaders ' debates in 2010 , which the @entity118 leader was widely regarded to have won			1
some conservatives have blamed the debates for denying the party an overall majority			0
mr @entity0 and mr @entity10 have also mocked the prime minister after it emerged he would not take part in an online question and answer session with young voters - something that the @entity6 and @entity132 leaders , the deputy prime minister and ms @entity13 have all done			1
conservative backbencher @entity134 , who challenged mr @entity1 for the leadership in 2005 , said that attempting to avoid tv debates ' may be right tactically ' but was not realistic			1
mr @entity134 told @entity33 's @entity137 : ' it 's unavoidable			0
they 've got to have the debate			0
it will happen , in an internet age			0
the broadcasters are controlled , the newspapers are n't			0
' we 've seen the @entity146 proposing a debate			0
the broadcasters will then be able to cover that , just as they did with @entity10 versus @entity9 which was on @entity151 and then it was on the national news that evening			0
that 's what will happen			0
