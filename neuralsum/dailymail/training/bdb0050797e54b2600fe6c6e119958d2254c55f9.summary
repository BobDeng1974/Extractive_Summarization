offensive : @entity2 reporter @entity1 twice referred to black footballers as ' coloured ' @entity2 news producers have been given a reprimand after they allowed a reporter to use the word ' coloured ' to describe soccer players and coaches			1
the word was used during a lunchtime news bulletin on february 26 about prime minister @entity12 hosting a summit on tackling racism in sport			0
twenty viewers complained to @entity2 and four to broadcasting watchdog @entity20 after the gaffe on the @entity19 programme			1
@entity2 executives quickly apologised on @entity22 , edited the word from the news report and removed the word from the report that appeared on the @entity28 website			1
they gave warnings about use of the word to the producer , programme editor and reporter			0
now , as a result of this , @entity20 has decided to take no action			1
it said : ' we noted that @entity2 recognised the editorial mistake almost immediately after broadcast , and took swift and appropriate action to mitigate the potential for further offence			1
' the industry watchdog said executives edited the report before it was repeated on the @entity19 @entity48 service and apologised in the press , on @entity22 and to the viewers that complained to them			2
it added : ' on balance , and in light of the steps taken by @entity2 to mitigate this offence , @entity20 therefore considered the matter resolved			1
' @entity1 , who reportedly earns £ 40,000 a show , said ' coloured ' twice during the @entity2 programme as he talked about racism in the game			1
' football has certainly come a long way since bananas were routinely thrown at coloured players , ' @entity1 reported			1
discrimination claims : @entity12 and @entity67 , right , hold a roundtable discussion at a @entity70 racism summit ' but one shameful statistic remains - only three of the @entity74 clubs employ a black manager , and one of those @entity77 , was only appointed at @entity78 a few days ago			2
' the government are funding a scheme to promote more coloured coaches and are also tackling the issue of homophobia in the sport			2
' using the term ' coloured ' to refer to black people is considered offensive because it dismisses everyone who is not white as the same			2
the term was in widespread use in @entity91 in the 1960s but is now considered racist			0
the problem is it suggests white people are white and everyone else is ' coloured '			0
there is no recognition that everyone has their own ethnic origin			0
@entity100 sparked a row by using the term last year on the day that @entity103 was charged with racially abusing @entity104			0
he denies the offence after mr @entity1 used the same term , one @entity22 user wrote to @entity2 : ' when was it okay to use the word coloured ? and to make it worse is that you were talking about racism ! ' an @entity2 spokesman said : ' the reporter ’s use of the term ‘ coloured ’ was inappropriate and we do not defend its use			1
' it was an editorial misjudgement and we apologise to those who were understandably offended by the use of this term			0
' he said that , although the report had been produced against a tight deadline ' we ccept that this does not excuse the mistake being made ... and understand the careful selection of appropriate language around the issues of race			0
' it said the report was reviewed before it was transmitted , but the word coloured was not spotted because of ' human error and editorial misjudgement '			2
the spokesman added : ' the reporter , producer and programme editor have all been made aware of the gravity of the error and the incident will feature in future newsroom compliance training			0
' following the blunder @entity12 said in @entity144 that there were ' worrying ' signs that racism is creeping back into football .			0

@entity150 called black players ' coloured '
@entity2 apologise saying report should have been more carefully checked
@entity20 *investigated* the incident but decided to take no further action
