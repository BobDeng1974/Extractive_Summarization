the gay comic , referred to only as ‘ mr x ’ at the hearing , is said to have showered tragic @entity1 with gifts then took him to drink and drug - fuelled parties			1
within weeks the fashion student felt ‘ dirty and used ’ as he had become immersed in ‘ a hedonistic lifestyle which he found distasteful ’			1
at one party he was persuaded to strip in front of a group of men who began to fondle him until one guest intervened and told them to stop			0

he bought me nice things , spent money on me , took me to places – private parties			0

bereaved : @entity91 and @entity93 , @entity1 's parents , are pictured arriving at the inquest a week ago @entity178 said @entity1 had told the nurse about a private party at a separate address			1
‘ at some point during this party a group of men got @entity1 to strip and began playing with him			0
another guest told them to stop			0
’ another nurse told how @entity1 claimed to have been raped			2
but once he had used the word he never returned to the subject			0
he had also asked his elder half - sister @entity190 : ‘ what do you think he is doing ? grooming me ? ’ the policeman told the inquest : ‘ @entity190 said that @entity1 led her to believe he had been raped			1
’ but police decided there was ‘ no conclusive evidence ’ that @entity1 was physically forced into sex and so had no grounds for questioning mr @entity34 the star ’s identity has been protected under an informal agreement between @entity79 coroner dr @entity204 and barristers representing @entity1 ’s family and the @entity207			1
