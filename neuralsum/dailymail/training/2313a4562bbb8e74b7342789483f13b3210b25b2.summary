two disabled brothers have allegedly been refused membership to a bowling club because they made other players feel ' uncomfortable '			1
@entity5 , 38 , and his brother @entity4 , 33 , who both have @entity7 's syndrome , went to a taster bowling session at a village club in @entity10 , @entity11 , but allegedly were soon told they were not welcome to join after a number of members threatened to leave			1
the brothers had bought new bowling shoes and paid Â£ 5 to play at the @entity17 , which had been arranged by their sister @entity18			1
she had rang ahead to check the boys would be welcome			1
now @entity22 , 35 , who lives with her brothers in @entity33 , @entity11 , has been left furious at the decision			1
ms @entity18 told the @entity35 : ' i am disgusted			1
this kind of discrimination is totally unacceptable			0
' i think these individuals need re-educating			0
' my brothers should n't have just been told to leave , without the members first getting to know them as people			1
@entity5 , left , and @entity4 , right , whose sister @entity22 says members should have got to know her brothers first ' people can not prejudice because of their disability			1
' if the members did n't like them as people and chose not to play with them , that is different , but a decision like that ca n't just be made based on their disability			1
' the boys refer to doting sister ms @entity18 as mum after their mother died , and ms @entity18 tries to organise daily activities for her brothers to keep them stimulated and entertained			2
she said : ' i could n't find a disabled bowls group so i called this club and asked if they could come , with their carer , and i was told it would n't be a problem			2
@entity5 , left , sits next to @entity22 's partner @entity63 with @entity4 , pictured far right , sitting next to his sister @entity22 who says that people should n't judge her brothers @entity5 and @entity4 based on just their disability alone ' they went and loved it and could n't wait to go back , but the following week staff pulled their carer aside and said : " sorry , but some members say having them here makes them feel uncomfortable "			1
' ' they then offered to get a third mat out so the boys could play on their own , then said actually that would n't be possible because there was n't enough space			2
' the club is a social one , and not competitive or in a league , so their actual ability was n't the issue			2
' ms @entity18 complained about the brothers ' treatment to the organisers , and a meeting was held with members to discuss the issue			1
she said : ' i was fuming			0
hearing they were having a meeting was like a red rag to a bull for me			2
' and ms @entity18 has n't been able to tell her brothers the truth about why they ca n't play , for fear of upsetting them			2
she said : ' obviously both boys are quite miffed about the situation but they do n't understand the full extent of why they ca n't play			0
' i had to be tactful			0
they knew there had been a problem and they could n't bowl but i said there was n't the room for them			0
ms @entity18 said : ' i just wanted to arrange something nice for them			0
if they are left to sit around they get bored and pick up bad habits like rocking			0
' the idea is that they can fully function in society with support and should be encouraged to do so			0
' ms @entity18 first complained on monday when the incident happened , but did not hear from the club until yesterday afternoon			0
the club has now told ms @entity18 her brothers would be welcome to join , but she declined the offer and said she will be looking elsewhere for a new club for her brothers			1
a spokesman from the @entity124 , said : ' after taking advice from the @entity127 , i spoke to @entity128 on wednesday afternoon , we came to an amicable agreement and i have no further comments to make			0
' ms @entity18 has now consulted @entity131 for advice .			0

@entity5 and @entity134 were told that some members had threatened to leave
sister @entity22 had rang ahead to see would the pair be welcome in village club
she is furious at the decision by the management and says she is ' disgusted '
members have since held meeting and say the brothers can play if they wish
but @entity22 now says she will look elsewhere for her brothers to go bowling
