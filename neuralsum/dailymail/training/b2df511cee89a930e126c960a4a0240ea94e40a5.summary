with the @entity2 's other posterboys - @entity3 and @entity4 - both impressing in their opening games , it was the turn of the world 's current best player @entity6 to strut his stuff in @entity9			1
sadly , @entity10 did n't read the script involving a goalscoring return that saw @entity6 carry his side to improbable victory - as they were humbled 4 - 0 by @entity15 at the @entity16			1
a red card in the first - half for @entity19 did n't help @entity10 's cause and , while the captain tried in vain to influence the outcome , @entity6 was generally chasing a lost cause			1
the only consolation being that he lasted the full 90minutes following recent injury concerns			0
16.50 : the great man 's name is mentioned for the first time as his selection on the left side of @entity10 's front three is confirmed			0
and , it does n't take long before the inevitable comparisons between football 's greatest rivals are brought up by @entity73			0
for the record , both @entity74 and @entity75 would have ' @entity77 in their side while @entity79 chose the more mercurial talents of @entity4			0
16:55 @entity6 appears as pristinely groomed as ever , especially in the company of hirsute teammate @entity82 , as @entity10 's jaunty national anthem is played ahead of the game in @entity50			2
boys from @entity9 : @entity6 acknowledges the ball boys in the tunnel ahead of the game jet burners : @entity6 shows a trademark burst of pace in the opening minutes to pass @entity15 's defence first blood : @entity6 hits his opening shot on target with a low drilled effort that 's saved by @entity97 did n't see you ! the @entity10 captain apologises for not thinking to pass to his teammates 0 - 4mins : after @entity15 start strongly , it 's several minutes before @entity6 gets his first touch of the @entity103			1
but , any fears over his fitness seem to have been allayed by a trademark burst of pace takes him past the @entity109 defence to set up striker @entity110 for @entity10 's first chance			0
7mins : a mistake by @entity113 allows @entity114 to steal the ball and feed @entity6 on the edge of the box			0
passing , of course , is never an option and @entity6 hits a low drilled shot that is easily collected by @entity97 - forcing him to apologise to his teammates			0
10mins : @entity15 1 - 0 @entity10 @entity121 deservedly opens the scoring from the penalty spot after @entity10 defender @entity124 is fortunate not to be dismissed for bundling @entity125 over in the box			1
@entity109 engineering : @entity15 take a deserved lead after @entity121 scores from the penalty spot das boot : @entity121 celebrates giving @entity15 the lead after netting his penalty 22mins : with @entity10 already chasing the game and @entity15 looking comfortable in possession , @entity6 is aggressively bundled off the ball by @entity137			1
it 's the sort of tackle that would have left the young @entity6 still rolling but he 's quickly on his feet without complaint			0
31mins : @entity15 2 - 0 @entity10 @entity15 are in total control of the game and , despite playing some beautiful possession football , their second goal comes from a set piece when a corner is met by a bullet header from @entity152 target @entity150			1
it is going to take an individual effort of @entity155 proportions for @entity6 to change the course of this game			2
34mins : the flaws in @entity10 's plan of trying to find @entity6 during practically every attack are exposed when both @entity161 and then @entity163 waste opportunities by trying to pass to their talisman when both were in superb positions to shoot			2
have it ! @entity6 is bundled off the ball by an aggressive shoulder barge by @entity137 ball watching : @entity6 struggles to make an impact on the game as @entity15 run riot during the first half man down : @entity6 looks on as a knock forces @entity10 striker @entity110 to be taken off using his head : @entity15 defender @entity150 wheels away after doubling his side 's lead from a corner mats the way to do it ! @entity152 target @entity150 points to the bench as he celebrates his goal 36mins : red card - @entity10 @entity10 's combustible defender @entity19 is given an almost customary red card ( 13 and counting ! ) for first bringing down @entity121 and then reacting to the @entity109 's histrionics with a pressing forehead			1
the mountain @entity6 needs to climb just got steeper			0
45mins : @entity15 3 - 0 @entity193 takes advantage of @entity10 's dwindling numbers when a poor clearance falls to the @entity109 false no 9 who smashes home to send his side into the interval three goals ahead			1
@entity203 of blood to the head : @entity10 defender @entity19 confronts @entity121 for overreacting to a foul early shower : the referee sends @entity19 off for the thirteenth time in his career - and in the country of his birth @entity121 - ed time ! @entity15 's false no 9 reacts to a mistake to score his second against 10 - men @entity10 @entity216 to climb : @entity6 gets a helping hand as his side head into half - time 3 - 0 down 46mins : @entity6 starts the second half amid suggestions that he might be rested for games that @entity10 still have a chance of winning			1
at 3 - 0 and a man down , @entity6 's @entity2 opener could be reduced to an opportunity to recover his match fitness and perhaps score a consolation goal			1
51mins : @entity10 manage a rare foray forward and @entity6 threads a nets pass into the area only for a lack of communication between his teammates leads to @entity161 stealing the ball from @entity163 before it rolls out of play			2
59mins : @entity6 wins a free - kick from distance and takes up his traditional wide stance before thumping into the @entity109 wall as he fails to add to his tally of two @entity2 goals - scored against @entity243 ( 2006 ) and @entity244 ( 2010 )			2
lean on me : @entity6 is consoled by @entity55 teammate @entity246 at half - time still got it ! at least @entity6 did n't show any adverse reactions to his recent injury problems 65mins : expectations are briefly raised from @entity10 fans as @entity6 picks up the ball and races forward			1
but , with his options limited by @entity19 's sending off , he elects for an optimistic long drive that is blocked by @entity150			2
74mins : @entity6 goes ballistic after @entity10 are denied what appears a bonafide penalty after @entity259 is brought down in the box chasing a blocked effort from @entity161			0
the severity of @entity6 's protestations suggest he is more concerned about getting his name on the scoresheet than the overall score			0
77mins : @entity109 4 - 0 @entity10 only moments later , the leading scorer at the @entity268 , @entity121 completes his hat - trick with a simple tap - in from close range on his 50th international appearance not going to plan : @entity6 would have been hoping for a better introduction to the @entity2 catch me if you can : @entity6 tries in vain to drag 10 - men @entity10 into the reckoning after the interval one man team ? @entity6 is left exhausted after he attempts to change to course of the game alone 83mins : @entity6 is still racing around the pitch as the game enters its final 10 minutes , allaying any fears over his fitness - but a second free - kick of the afternoon is aimed in the same place as the first , somehow managing to hit @entity113 in a one - man @entity109 wall			1
91mins : @entity6 's final contribution to the evening is another free - kick			0
this time he clears the ball with a thunderous effort that forces @entity97 to make an excellent save and deny @entity6 even a small moment of personal glory			0
with @entity19 likely to miss the rest of the group stage and worrying injuries to the likes of @entity110 and @entity163 , @entity10 face a daunting task to qualify from a group that also contains @entity305 and the @entity306 whether @entity6 is firing on all cylinders or not			2
@entity15 , meanwhile , look awesome			0
going ballistic ! @entity6 pleads in vain after referee @entity310 denies @entity10 a late penalty the magoc number : @entity121 completes his hat - trcik on his 30th international appearance @entity6 looks dejected after @entity10 lose their opening @entity2 game 4 - 0 to @entity15			1

@entity10 were defeated 4 - 0 by @entity15 in their @entity2 opener
@entity6 returned from injury but could n't change the game
@entity10 defender @entity19 was sent off for aggressive *behaviour* in first half
@entity121 completed a hat - trick on his 50th appearance for @entity15
@entity152 target @entity150 scored @entity15 's other goal
