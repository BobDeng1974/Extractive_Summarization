‘ @entity1 ’s case proves domestic violence against men still is n't taken seriously ’ by @entity5 published : 07:43 est , 7 september 2012 updated : 02:39 est , 13 september 2012 earlier this week , @entity6 detailed the story of @entity8 : a @entity10 woman arrested for cutting off her boyfriend 's penis and flushing it down the toilet			1
her defenceless victim , 46 year - old @entity14 , suffered the violent assault while sleeping in a hostel			2
currently in intensive care , he will no longer be able to urinate without medical intervention , enjoy sex or father children			2
and suspected infidelity at that			2
@entity26 ¿ ez was a @entity10 woman arrested for cutting off her boyfriend 's penis and flushing it down the toilet immediately , the story went viral			2
news sites across the world re-reported it - some sympathetically , others with glee , as if this terrible assault was karmic revenge for all the hideous sex crimes committed against women since the beginning of time			1
it 's an extreme form of sexually - related domestic violence - and something which is increasingly common for men across the world			1
last year , @entity49 was arrested in @entity50 for drugging her husband 's dinner , tying him to their bed and severing his penis before destroying it in a garbage disposal unit			2
when police arrived she told them ' he deserved it '			0
why ? because he 'd asked for a divorce			0
in december 2011 , 70 year - old @entity63 was detained in @entity64 for savagely attacking her husband 's genitals with industrial scissors			0
she will now answer to charges of assault with a deadly weapon , spousal abuse and mayhem			0
prior to that , in 2004 , @entity74 @entity73 was jailed for ripping off - an attempting to swallow - one of her ex-boyfriend 's testicles , simply because he rejected her advances at a party			0
the woman allegedly flushed her partner 's penis down the toilet and in april this year , @entity84 from @entity85 was arrested for trying to tear her ex-partner 's penis from his body with her bare hands			0
the unprovoked attack , which was also reported by the @entity6 , happened while her victim was already making a desperate 999 call for help			0
although these cases seem rare - and people will argue that they pale in comparison to attacks suffered by women - the reality is very , very different			1
in @entity101 , rates of penis removal are so high that doctors are having to specialise in re-attaching severed organs - assuming that patients do n't die of blood loss first			1
these vile crimes have nothing to do with self - defence or survival			0
they 're about women assuming a right to avenge a broken heart			1
the same misguided belief , i assume , that violent men feel when they throw acid in their ex-girlfriend 's face			1
the difference is , however , that society rightly condemns violence against women - but not men			1
i was a 12 year - old boy in 1993 when @entity125 became an icon for slicing off her husband 's penis because : ' he always have [ sic ] [ an ] orgasm and he does n't wait for me to have [ an ] orgasm			1
' the price she paid for this ? not a single day in jail			0
the message it sent out ? that men deserve everything they get for having the bad taste to be male			1
as a child , this incident - and how she escaped justice - resonated with me			0
not least because it was celebrated			0
@entity148 female figures like @entity149 joked about the matter , creating a culture which cheered violent women			1
as someone who was bullied by girls at school ( because they knew i ethically could n't - and would n't - hit back ) , i could see the manipulation of my gender on a micro and macro level			1
nineteen years on and nothing has changed			0
men - like the boys who will grow up to be abused men - are still fed the same sexist mantra that i was at 12 : ' hell hath no fury like a woman scorned '			1
this is particularly dangerous when women they 'll share a bed with believe it			1
and suspected infidelity at that ( posed by model ) twelve months ago , while talking about @entity49 's case on live television , @entity175 claimed that it was ' fabulous '			2
the next day , she was forced to apologise through gritted teeth - but clearly had no idea why her comments were so wicked in the first place			0
and this is the root of the problem : dangerous ignorance			2
not least because official statistics prove that men are almost equal victims of domestic violence			1
according to charity @entity192 , for every three victims of partner abuse , two will be female , one will be male			0
likewise , one in six men and one in four women will suffer domestic abuse in their lifetime			1
the event took place while her defenseless victim lay sleeping ( posed by model ) despite this , the lion 's share of resources - including government funding - only ever serves females			0
in fact , most shelters actively turn men away			2
do n't believe me ? ask @entity211 - the woman who , in 1971 , founded the world 's first ever domestic violence safehouse			1
a heroine , she herself had to flee @entity216 after radicalised feminists sent her death threats for saying that men also suffer abuse			2
something which is backed up by fact , after fact , after fact			0
the added proof that lesbian relationships experience near - identical rates of violence to heterosexual ones is further evidence that women also communicate with their fists			1
but society continues to fail us by turning a blind eye			0
apparently , us men already have it too good			2
try telling that to @entity14 and his family who were weeping on @entity10 tv			0
yes , my comments will be ridiculed and rejected , but all inconvenient truths are at first			0
my main hope is that eventually all victims will be offered the protection they deserve : regardless of gender			0
hopefully , in light of this week 's latest tragedy , the law will deliver a clear message that domestic violence is no less horrendous when the attacker is female .			1
