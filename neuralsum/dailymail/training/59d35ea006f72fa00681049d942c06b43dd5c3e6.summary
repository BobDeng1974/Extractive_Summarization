@entity1 clubs backed chief executive @entity2 to stay in office after the sexist emails scandal , despite @entity5 suggesting he could have been sacked			1
an emergency meeting involving all 17 teams — promoted clubs are not yet members of the top flight — voted unanimously to support @entity2			1
he will face no further action after his email exchanges with tv rights lawyer @entity14			0
this came after the prime minister was asked if ‘ someone in your team could survive that sort of thing ? ’ ‘ no , i do n’t think they would , ’ said mr @entity5 on @entity22			1
‘ people should treat everybody else with respect			0
’ watch : @entity2 will be called to account by the @entity28 to deliver his promises criticism : prime minister @entity5 described sexist emails sent by @entity2 as ' unacceptable ' ' entering into email exchanges of this nature was wrong and the apology i have made is sincere , as is the contrition i feel			1
these exchanges do not reflect my views towards women in football , the workplace or in general			0
it is something that will never be repeated			0
' the premier league shareholders have considered and deliberated this matter and i fully accept and respect their recommendations and conclusions			0
' i appreciate that i have a tremendous amount of hard work to do to convince those in the game who do not know me that my leadership and work in the areas of equality and discrimination to date reflect who i am and what i believe			1
so , i will now undertake meetings and discussions with a wide range of stakeholders in the game to hear their views and to reassure them that i will continue to do my utmost personally , and through all the @entity1 ’s means to help promote diversity and inclusion , develop the women ’s game and support women who want be involved in football at any level			2
' i am grateful for the support i have received throughout this from family , friends and colleagues , but especially the women who work with me at the @entity1			2
' @entity2 has now promised to meet with a wide range of stakeholders to discuss equality issues			2
he said : ‘ entering into email exchanges of this nature was wrong and the apology i have made is sincere , as is the contrition i feel			0
these exchanges do not reflect my views			0
‘ i have a tremendous amount of hard work to do to convince those in the game who do not know me that my work in the areas of equality and discrimination reflect what i believe			1
‘ i will undertake meetings to reassure them that i will do my utmost to help promote diversity and inclusion			0
’ but this pledge is unlikely to satisfy bodies such as @entity102 , @entity103 , and the @entity28 ’s inclusion advisory board , who have led the storm of protests since @entity2 ’s temporary @entity108 , @entity109 , went to a sunday newspaper with the email exchanges			0
how they were obtained might still be the subject of a complaint by @entity1 clubs to police			2
the pressure groups are now likely to concentrate their attack on the @entity1 ’s governance process which saw @entity1 interim chairman @entity120 , a shooting pal of @entity2 ’s , leading the investigation that concluded yesterday			1
lord @entity122 , chairman of @entity103 , said : ‘ the process adopted by the @entity1 is a flawed one and there was only ever going to be one outcome			0
important role : @entity2 presented @entity129 players with their @entity1 winners ' medals ‘ it is incumbent on the @entity1 to put in place a proper , objective , fair and independent process for dealing with such important matters in future			1
‘ the prime minister stated he would n’t tolerate these comments in his own @entity140			1
‘ a decision like this and the way it was made reflects the dominance , strength and culture at the top of the football pyramid			0
’ a meeting of the @entity1 ’s four - strong audit and remuneration committee had been scheduled to decide @entity2 ’s fate			1
instead a meeting , chaired by @entity154 , took place at their @entity157 offices			0
@entity154 had carried out an investigation in conjunction with law firm @entity160 , specifically appointed for this			0
the @entity1 investigation found no evidence of a wider discriminatory attitude or inappropriate language			1
pressure : @entity167 believes @entity2 should consider his position at the @entity1 and @entity169 — the senior female executive nicknamed @entity170 in the exchanges — confirmed she was not then , and is not now , offended by the references			2
a @entity1 statement said : ‘ the weight of comments made by female staff indicate that they find the @entity1 an excellent place to work			2
' in the light of a previously unblemished record over 15 years of service to the @entity1 , the clubs resolved unanimously that no further disciplinary action is required			1

@entity1 puts out statement saying its clubs ' resolved unanimously that no further disciplinary action is required or *justified* ' for @entity2
the organisation says a thorough investigation revealed ' no evidence of wider discriminatory attitudes '
@entity2 acknowledged in a statement that he had a ' tremendous amount of hard work to convince those in the game who do not know me that my leadership and work in the areas of equality and discrimination to date reflect who i am and what i believe in '
prime minister @entity5 had *earlier* today described sexist emails sent from @entity1 account of @entity2 as ' unacceptable '
@entity2 had been under fire following the publication of the emails
