by @entity0 published : 04:39 est , 8 august 2012 updated : 07:34 est , 8 august 2012 scientists say it may be possible to kick - start immune systems in children infants are prone to sickness due to under - developed immune systems - but scientists say it may be possible to activate crucial cells to help them fight off diseases from an earlier age			0
researchers at the @entity14 suggest the natural ability to fight infection is there early on - but key cell signals inhibit the growth of essential immune cells early in life			1
blocking this signaling could lead to improving an infant 's response to infection , according to the study published in @entity27			1
study author @entity28 , an assistant professor in the @entity29 , said : ' what happens at early age is that natural killer cells , like many other immune cells , do not complete their functional maturation until adulthood			2
' during this time we are left with an immature immune system that can not protect us against infections , the reason why newborns and infants are more prone to infection			0
' there is a large gap in understanding infant immunity , specifically why the natural killer cell responses are deficient			0
the study by immunologists at the u-m demonstrates the role of a cell called transforming growth factor beta that can explain why			1
the study showed the production of natural killer cells is controlled by @entity56 , which is produced in the bone marrow			2
in infant mice , the maturation of natural killer cells progressed faster in the absence of tgf - Î² signaling			2
by adulthood , mice had 10 times more mature natural killer cells if @entity56 signaling was blocked			1
' our overall goal was to determine the factors that constraint the production and maturation of natural killer cells early in life , ' said @entity28			0
' to our surprise , we discovered that natural killer cells can complete maturation as early as 10 days of age if @entity56 signaling is blocked			1
' authors say it 's tempting to propose the functional inactivation @entity56 signaling as a strategy to reverse the deficit of natural killer cells early in life			0
the team say additional testing will be required .			0

blocking signals from growth cell called ' @entity56 ' led to rapid maturation of immune response in mice
