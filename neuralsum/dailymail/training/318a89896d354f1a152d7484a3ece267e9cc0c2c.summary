by @entity0 last updated at 8:16 am on 30th september 2011 @entity1 has admitted he turned to his spurned brother @entity2 for advice on his keynote speech at the @entity6 conference in @entity7			1
the revelation came as a party member blasted the brothers ' feud as a ' cloud hanging over @entity6			1
' mr @entity1 said his brother had advised him to ' be his own person ' in the speech , and the @entity6 leader followed it up with an attack last night on the government 's cuts to public sector pensions			1
mr @entity1 has faced criticism for a lack of strong policies since he beat his brother in last year 's leadership contest			1
brotherly advice : @entity1 ( right ) denied talk of a feud and said absent brother @entity2 advised him on his keynote speech to the conference on tuesday he has now criticised @entity31 for wrongly ' slapping a three per cent per cent tax rise on public sector workers without properly negotiating '			1
his insistence that the prime minister needed to talk to the unions will be well received after @entity38 's @entity37 said this week that millions of workers expected support from @entity6			2
but mr @entity1 was challenged over his troubled relationship with his brother during a question and answer session at the conference and urged to bring @entity2 back from ' political @entity45 '			1
@entity46 , a special constable from @entity47 , asked : ' do n't you think it 's time to bring @entity2 out of political @entity45 and for once end all the rumours and innuendo about backbiting ? ' because this party is not going to win if people focus on that and that is what the media is focusing on			2
attack : @entity31 came in for criticism from @entity1 , who said the prime minister had failed to negotiate before cutting public sector pensions ' we need to unite and we need to move forward otherwise we are not going to win in 2015			1
' mr @entity1 acknowledged that his defeat of his brother , who is missing the party conference and instead giving a speech in the @entity65 , had been ' difficult for us '			1
he said : ' @entity2 is a massive asset to our politics and our party ... i have always said i would be happy to have him back , i want to have him back , but in the end he has got to decide what is the right thing for him to do			1
' he has been incredibly supportive to me in relation to the speech i gave on tuesday and throughout the last year			2
' but ms @entity46 said later : ' i wanted a straight answer and i did n't get one			2
we want the party to unite and @entity1 to put an end to this once and for all			1
this is a cloud hanging over @entity6			2
' the @entity6 leader tried to emphasise his closeness to his brother by detailing how @entity2 had helped him him develop his vision			0
he said : ' i talked to him before the speech , he 's currently abroad , and he gave me good advice			0
the advice was " be your own person , say what you think " and that 's what i did and that 's what i 'm going to keep doing			0
' what i 've set out is a vision for how we can change this country and where i stand - against the closed circles of @entity99 that hold people back			0
we 've seen that today , the top universities not doing enough to open up to state school pupils , that 's wrong , i think it 's got to change			0
' how are we going to take on the vested interests at the top of our society , whether it 's the energy companies or the banks , real changes that can help the people of @entity99 ? ' in his latest stand against mr @entity31 's pensions changes , mr @entity1 said : ' the most important thing is that we have proper negotiations and the government engages seriously in the negotiations			1
family ties : @entity1 ( left ) awkwardly embraces brother @entity2 after winning the @entity121 leadership contest ' at the moment what the government has done is slapped a three per cent tax rise on public sector workers without properly negotiating , without it being recommended by an independent report			1
' i say the government should not be doing that , it should be engaging in proper , serious negotiations with the trade unions			0
' it 's their responsibility to stop the strike , which is after all scheduled for two months ' time if a ballot goes through , it 's their responsibility to stop it happening			0
' mr @entity1 now has the freedom to choose his own frontbench team instead of seeing them elected , after the conference changed the party 's rules			1
but he refused to comment on the possibility of an imminent reshuffle , saying : ' i 've got an excellent team			0
i think it 's right to change the rules though , because i do n't think the public want us looking inwards having shadow cabinet elections - the old system - but looking outwards to them			2
' @entity157 , from @entity7 , was the real star of the show as she told mr @entity1 about cuts at her school , @entity160			1
the 15 - year - old won warm applause after describing how her school was being ' attacked by the coalition government '			0
the @entity6 leader was also given a rough ride by disability rights campaigner @entity167 , 35 , from @entity169 , who claimed he was ' reinforcing the destructive rhetoric ' on welfare by talking about someone he met who was on sickness benefits and could have worked			0
mr @entity1 replied : ' i 'm not questioning the fact that he genuinely had an ailment ... but i just say to you the system did n't demand that he go back to work , the system wrote him off			1
' he added : ' i genuinely do n't think that saying you are tough on abuse of the benefit system is a @entity184 thing to do			0
i think it is fundamentally a @entity6 thing to do			0
' he went on to reject calls for a referendum on @entity191 membership , said strikes should only ever be a ' last resort ' and said he would like to see more working class mps			0
he said that the @entity195 had taught him that it was ' wrong ' to support dictators in the @entity197 and @entity198 on the grounds that they were a bulwark against terrorism			0
mr @entity1 later told @entity203 's @entity202 he was ' in favour of capitalism , just for the record , but it is what kind of capitalism you have			1
' he said the new @entity6 model of using the proceeds of growth to invest in public services and tackle poverty had advantages and disadvantages			2
' the disadvantages were that it did n't change the way the economy worked enough , it did not lower inequality , and , also , for the next 10 years , there is n't going to be that money around , ' he said			0
on the final day of the conference , deputy labour leader @entity226 will accuse the conservatives of plotting to wipe out millions of @entity6 's core votes by pushing people off the electoral register			0
the conference will also hear today from some of the 3,000 workers who are set to lose their jobs at @entity236 .			2
