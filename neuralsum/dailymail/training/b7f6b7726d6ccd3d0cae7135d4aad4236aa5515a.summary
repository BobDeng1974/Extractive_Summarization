by @entity0 published : 09:11 est , 3 march 2014 updated : 15:08 est , 3 march 2014 the awkward interplay between 12 years a @entity3 € ™ s screenwriter and director at last nightâ € ™ s @entity5 has sparked rumors of a rift at the heart of the movie that was the star of the night			2
director @entity12 and screenwriter @entity13 looked less than pleased to see each other do well , with a series of apparent snubs to each other as the statues were given out			1
as @entity13 was announced as the winner of best screenplay , @entity12 gave a stilted slow hand clap as the rest of the room burst into applause			2
and in return , @entity13 gave @entity12 a very clear cold shoulder as he bypassed the film 's director completely when he went towards the stage			1
moving right past : as @entity13 went on stage to collect his screenwriting @entity5 , he did not stop and hug anyone related to the film who were all sitting in front of him , including director @entity12 ( right ) clear slight : rather than hug anyone related to the film , including star @entity39 of mega producer @entity40 , @entity13 went across the aisle and gave @entity44 hustle director @entity43 a hug rather than give a brief hug or handshake to @entity12 or anyone else related to the project who were all sitting directly in front of him , @entity46 gave his only hug ( aside from his wife @entity54 ) to @entity56 director @entity43 who was sitting across the aisle			1
he also gave @entity58 a pat on the back as he headed up the steps but his warmth ended there as he did not mention @entity12 in his acceptance speech			1
he paid respects to the film 's producers ' mr @entity66 ' and @entity69			0
@entity12 should have taken acting cues from his cast as well , as the @entity73 - born director did an unenthusiastic palm clap and failed to even smile throughout the ordeal			2
when it was his turn to speak as the film won @entity78 , @entity12 did not mention @entity13 either			1
on the outside : @entity13 stood at the back and did n't interact with any of the other members of the film 's team during their @entity78 acceptance suggestions that a feud may be brewing between the two men were immediate			2
entertainment reporter @entity88 was the first to suggest a reason , hinting that @entity12 may have been vying for a screenwriting credit of his own			0
' my sources attributing @entity13 - @entity12 cold shoulder at @entity5 tonight to dispute over screenplay credit , ' she wrote on @entity95			2
12 years a slave is @entity12 's third feature film , after @entity98			0
walking right past : @entity13 did n't acknowledge @entity100 or producer @entity66 , but only giving @entity66 a mention during his speech when he was on stage bizarre : rather than smile , @entity12 only gave @entity13 an unenthusiastic open - palm clap , and it is now rumored that he wanted a credit as a co-writer for the film like he has received in his last two pictures stoic : @entity12 was effusive when @entity100 won @entity111 but showed no such love for @entity13 , only giving this perfunctory clap as he walked towards the stage serious moment : while @entity13 thanked the film 's producers ' mr @entity66 ' and @entity69 , he did not mention @entity118 at all even though they had been working on the project together since 2008 he was credited as a co-writer and director in both of those films , and in this latest one he was only listed as the director and one of the producers			1
as @entity13 mentioned in his speech , he started his @entity128 career by writing for sitcoms including @entity131 's eponymous show and @entity132			1
his first film was the poorly - received @entity135 thriller @entity136 that he co-wrote with director @entity137			0
in 1999 , he wrote @entity43 's film @entity139 , which may explain why he went out of his way to hug his former collaborator on sunday night			1
he then took a thematic turn , writing the 2002 comedy @entity143			0
at the back : @entity13 was one of the last ones on stage when they won @entity78 and he hid behind the cast rolling his eyes ? photos show that he was not smiling nor enthused at what is widely considered the night 's biggest award but may have even been making light of the win standing apart : @entity13 physically removed himself from the group returning the favor : when @entity12 gave a speech as the film won @entity78 , he did not mention @entity13 at all either more recently he co-wrote the @entity161 film @entity162 and then wrote and directed the @entity164 biopic @entity163 which was released at the @entity166 in september and will be on screens more widely this summer			1
career high : @entity13 started out by writing for sitcoms like @entity132 @entity13 has told how he and @entity12 started talking about doing a slave - era project together in 2008 and he told @entity171 that it was @entity12 's wife who found the @entity174 story to use as the baseline			1
' @entity12 said , " i really wanted to tell a story about that time and place and the slave era in @entity44 but i wanted to have a character that was not obvious in terms of their trade in slavery , someone who had artistic abilities and who had station but found themselves in a different geographical location			0
something that has scope and scale emotionally , " ' according to @entity13			0
' working with @entity12 was difficult only with the geography			0
he lives in @entity193 and i live in @entity195 and in that time period " @entity196 " came together for him and " @entity163 " came together for me but we both thought that this was something worth doing			0
' in addition to taking home three of the biggest @entity5 , 12 years a slave also had a successful night on saturday at the @entity201 winning @entity202 , director , screenplay , supporting female , and @entity206			0
distancing himself : @entity12 looked as if he was actively trying to avert his eyes so as not to look at @entity13 what a difference : when they won for @entity78 , however , he was literally jumping for joy mixed reactions : @entity13 did not seem happy to greet @entity213 , whose partner @entity66 produced his film , but was much more interested in talking to @entity217 backstage @entity13 was said to have become emotional during his speech and even went so far as to mention @entity12 in his speech at the event , calling the director ' fun '			1
' as much as i thought the memoir in @entity174 's words was special i had no idea what i was a part of until i saw the film in @entity166 , ' he said			0
@entity13 went on to give a shout out to @entity230 , who was nominated as a co-writer for before midnight			0
for his part , @entity12 chose to highlight the talents of @entity39 , who has been in every one of his three movies including 12 years a slave - but showed no such love for @entity13 .			2

screenwriter @entity13 did n't mention @entity12 once in his acceptance speech when he won for @entity239
@entity12 looked on *sternly* as @entity13 walked up as it appears the two men , who worked on the project together since 2008 , are feuding
@entity12 received co-writing credits for both of his previous two films but not this one
@entity13 chose to hug his former collaborator @entity56 director @entity43 on his way up to the stage instead of anyone from ' slave '
neither mentioned one another in their respective speeches but at the @entity258 called @entity12 ' fun '
previous writing credits include @entity132 , @entity262 , @entity139 and @entity143
