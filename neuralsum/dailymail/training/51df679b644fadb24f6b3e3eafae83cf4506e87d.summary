a college student is hoping to inspire others by eating bugs			1
@entity3 , a senior at @entity4 , has committed himself to a 30 - day diet that includes bugs in all of his meals			1
and , being in college , this means mealworms , crickets and even cockroaches added to takeout , @entity14 and @entity15 food , and a lot of pizza			0
' i do n't feel like i 'm being adventurous at all , ' he explained to the @entity33			0
' i 'm a pretty picky eater			0
' no doubt helping @entity3 is the fact that the taste is not much of an issue			1
' they absorb flavors pretty damn well , ' he said			0
' crickets work really well with taco seasoning and lime juice , so that 's been working great			0
' his very first meal was an omelette with a little avocado and some mealworms ( above ) more worms , in oatmeal , along with a cricket bar ( left ) and his supplies for the month ( right ) he even started his own blog to detail his experience , 30 days of bugs , and seven days in is very much enjoying waxworms , which he said are ' incredibly adaptive , ' and protein bars made with cricket flour			1
he also noted ; ' for the self - conscious entomophagist , mealworms and chow mein are a great meal to eat in public			2
' and his new diet already seems to be having an influence on those close to him he revealed ; ' it 's starting to pick up as a sort of local movement			2
a lot of my friends are getting curious and having dinner with me , and then their friends are getting interested			0
' the best things about bugs though is how sustainable they are said @entity3 , especially when compared to animal proteins			1
' i did n't realize how sustainable it is to eat bugs			1
and i think a lot of people do n't know			0
i mean i knew that there were people eating worms in other countries , but i did n't know that it was a healthy thing to do -- or that people really thought they tasted good , ' he admitted			2
" ' so that 's what i 'm trying to do , i guess			0
i just want to share the good news			2
' @entity3 also said has one more challenge he wants to undertake before this is all over - ' eating a couple tarantulas			1

@entity96 , a senior at @entity4 , is adding insects , *spiders* and worms to his diet for the next 30 days
he is hoping that his new eating *habits* will inspire others to eat bugs , and is keeping a blog to share all his meals
@entity3 is enjoying the taste , finding worms in particular are very ' adaptable ' to the foods they are put in
