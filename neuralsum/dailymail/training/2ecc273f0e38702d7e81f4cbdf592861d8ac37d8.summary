after being selected by the @entity2 in the 2014 @entity3 , then waived from their practice squad , @entity1 's professional football future seemed somewhat bleak			1
that all changed in september however when the @entity7 added him to their practice squad , though they too waived him in late october making him a free agent			0
now , @entity1 is wondering why he keeps getting cut because he says he has the talent to play professional football			1
' and while they took that to mean @entity1 was saying he was cut because he was gay , he quickly clarified his statement on @entity30			2
' despite what headlines you may read , i ’ve never said and have never believed that i am being kept out of the league , ' wrote @entity1			0
' i know i have talent to play in the @entity3 and i look forward to getting an opportunity once again to prove that i can help a team win			0
' clearing the air : @entity1 later clarified his statement to @entity20 on twitter reaffirming : he repeated that he knew he had the talent , but has never believed his sexuality is why he was cut or not playing superstar : @entity1 was named one of @entity44 's @entity43 football or not , @entity1 's career has been taking off since he graduated from @entity47 , with the 24 - year - old becoming perhaps the most famous openly gay professional athlete , becoming so big he even graced the cover of @entity44 as they named him one of their @entity43			1
and if the @entity3 does n't work out he does have a big fan in @entity55 front man @entity54 , who has been very vocal about wanting him for he new @entity58 @entity57 team .			0

@entity1 , the first openly gay player in the @entity3 , was *dropped* from the @entity2 and the @entity7 this *season*
in an *interview* with @entity20 he said he had the talent to play in the @entity3 , which is an *implication* that he believed he was cut for being gay
@entity1 later cleared up the *confusion* , saying he does not think his sexuality has anything to do with why he was cut
