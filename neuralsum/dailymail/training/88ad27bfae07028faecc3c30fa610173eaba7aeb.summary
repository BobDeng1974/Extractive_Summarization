you could even say he has been hostile			0
‘ after over a year of attempting to reach a settlement , @entity0 is definitely ready to move on			1

’ as they were : the couple split in 2011 but @entity0 is now keen to end it once and for all after growing sick of the financial settlement both parties have called in heavyweight lawyers and @entity9 is being represented by @entity87 - based @entity86 , who recently won a large settlement for @entity89 against @entity91 businessman @entity90 over their five - year - old daughter			1

' he added : ' i will forever cherish the time i spent with @entity0			2
marriage is one of the most difficult things in the world and unfortunately sometimes they fail			2
