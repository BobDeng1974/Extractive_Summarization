by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor archbishop of canterbury @entity2 insisted the nation 's values were based on the @entity6 faith @entity9 is a @entity6 country , the archbishop of @entity8 insisted today in boost for @entity11 in his row with atheists about his @entity15 message			1
@entity2 said he agreed with the prime minister that the country 's values had been ‘ shaped and founded on ’ the religion			1
but he admitted that proof of the importance of @entity6 to the @entity9 could not be found in attendance numbers at church , which have continued to fall over several years			0
mr @entity11 was criticised for saying ‘ we should be more confident about our status as a @entity6 country ’ and ‘ more evangelical ’ about faith			1
the prime minister also warned that people who ‘ advocate some sort of secular neutrality fail to grasp the consequences of that neutrality , or the role that faith can play in helping people to have a moral code ’			0
the article provoked a response from more than 50 leading public figures , organised by the @entity40 , warning mr @entity11 risked sowing ‘ alienation and division ’ in society			1
but @entity44 said the response to the @entity28 ’s comments had been ‘ all quite baffling and at the same time quite encouraging ’			0
he said the @entity6 faith is much more vulnerable to ‘ comfortable indifference than to hatred and opposition ’			0
writing on his blog , he added : ‘ it is a historical fact ( perhaps unwelcome to some , but true ) that our main systems of ethics , the way we do law and justice , the values of our society , how we decide what is fair , the protection of the poor , and most of the way we look at society ... all have been shaped by and founded on @entity6			1
’ he added : ‘ it is clear that , in the general sense of being founded in @entity6 faith , this is a @entity6 country			2
‘ it is certainly not in terms of regular churchgoing , although altogether , across different denominations , some millions attend church services each week			0
‘ others of different backgrounds have also positively shaped our common heritage			2
‘ but the language of what we are , what we care for and how we act is earthed in @entity6 , and would remain so for many years even if the number of believers dropped out of sight ( which they wo n't , in my opinion )			0
’ @entity11 , pictured at an @entity15 event in @entity89 this month , sparked controversy with his claim that @entity9 is a @entity6 country deputy prime minister @entity92 also gave his support to mr @entity11 – despite being an atheist			1
mr @entity92 said @entity9 's history and heritage was ‘ infused by @entity6 ’ but people of ‘ all faiths and none ’ were able to share values of ‘ fair play and tolerance ’			1
but he also called for the separation of the @entity104 from the state			1
deputy prime minister @entity92 called for the separation of the @entity104 and the state on his @entity108 phone - in show mr @entity92 said : ‘ i 'm not a man of faith but i do n't find it particularly controversial to say , if you look at our history , heritage , our architecture , our values , of course it is infused by @entity6			1
‘ i 'm slightly nonplussed by people getting very worked up about it			0
‘ i 'm not a practising man of faith but i do n't find it an issue to say we have an important @entity6 identity in terms of our history and heritage and so on			0
‘ that is not to say that somehow we are exclusively @entity6 , where everybody is a @entity6 or indeed that we have got one @entity6 denomination - there are almost as many @entity134 as @entity135 in this country			0
‘ of course we should remember that one of the greatest christian values - if you want to put it that way - of tolerance , is that we are open to people of other denominations , other faiths , of all faiths and none			0
‘ it 's the senses of fair play and tolerance that makes our country very special			2
’ mr @entity92 added : ‘ recognising our history and our heritage and who we are and have been over several centuries does n't mean that you have to say you are a @entity6 to believe in tolerance and diversity , i 'm just saying that actually they are not incompatible with each other , that 's all			2
’ he said disestablishing the @entity104 , separating it from the state , would be ‘ better for @entity135 ’ but accepted such a change would not happen overnight .			2

@entity2 says country 's values are ' shaped and founded ' on religion
he backs @entity11 who sparked row for article marking @entity15
