rescuers have reached a second ship containing hundreds of migrants which was found drifting towards @entity4 in stormy seas with no crew on board having been abandoned by the smugglers			1
an @entity10 coast guard ship , part of a new @entity13 patrol force to aid migrants at sea , made contact with the stricken vessel @entity18 – thought to have 450 migrants on board – and has brought it under tow			1
it comes as nearly 1,000 migrants were saved earlier this week when the coastguard boarded another ship sailing without a crew and stopped it from crashing into the coast of @entity4			1
@entity51 said that after several hours of struggling in rough seas , rescue teams managed to secure the @entity40 for towing toward the southern @entity42 region			1
the @entity54 - flagged cargo ship apparently set sail from @entity56 , he said			0
the exact port of the @entity18 's arrival will depend on sea conditions , authorities aid			0
earlier on friday , @entity49 said that a migrant had called for help saying : ' we 're without crew , we 're heading toward the @entity4 coast and we have no one to steer			2
' the @entity18 is the second cargo ship full of migrants to be abandoned while still sailing this week			2
days earlier , the @entity4 @entity69 in a daring attempt , lowered officials onto another , @entity74 - flagged cargo vessel so they could take control of the ship , which was only a few miles from crashing into the @entity4 coast			1
more than 170,000 migrants were intercepted or needed rescue by @entity4 navy , coast guard and air force patrols last year			2
this apparently new technique by smugglers of abandoning a ship after setting it on a crash course complicates rescue efforts , @entity49 told @entity4 state radio , ` ' but the important thing is there are lives to be saved			2
' the cargo ship @entity18 – thought to have 450 migrants on board – was apparently abandoned in rough seas by smugglers in the @entity98			1
the @entity4 @entity99 has launched a rescue operation the new high - seas drama came two days after @entity4 sailors intercepted a freighter carrying more than 700 mostly @entity48 migrants was abandoned by the people smugglers who had navigated it from @entity56 the @entity4 @entity99 was last night called in and sent a helicopter from an air base in southern @entity4 to help the 60 metre long @entity18 , a ship sailing under the flag of @entity54 , which was spotted 40 miles off the south eastern top of @entity4			1
it was hoped the coastguard could be lowered down to secure the ship and doctors could also come aboard			0
prior to losing power , the ship had been moving at seven knots and had been spotted by a coastguard plane 80 miles offshore shortly after nightfall			2
the new high - seas drama comes just two days after @entity4 sailors intercepted a freighter carrying more than 700 mostly @entity48 migrants which had been heading for the rocks of @entity4 's southeastern shore on autopilot , having been abandoned by the people smugglers who had navigated it from @entity56			1
in that incident , the @entity74 - registered @entity127 cargo ship got to within five miles - or 45 minutes sailing time - of a disaster before six navy officers were lowered on to the ship by helicopter and succeeded in bringing it under control			0
the vessel 's human cargo included 60 children and two pregnant women , one of whom gave birth on board , according to the @entity4 @entity142			1
many of the migrants on the ship were treated for hypothermia and broken limbs			0
@entity4 has rescued more than 170,000 in the last 14 months - hundreds have died trying to make the crossing the migrant boat dramas have come as @entity4 grapples with the aftermath of the @entity152 ferry disaster in which at least 13 people died following an onboard fire that erupted before dawn on sunday in waters off @entity157			0
they also come after a record year for people fleeing conflict and poverty in the @entity162 , @entity163 and @entity164 attempting to reach @entity13 by sea			0
more than 170,000 people have been rescued by @entity4 in the last 14 months and hundreds , possibly thousands , have died trying to make the crossing			0
they are almost invariably under the control of ruthless traffickers who earn thousands of dollars for every person they put to sea from @entity173 and other departure points in @entity163			0
increasingly the traffickers get their human cargoes to @entity13 by putting them out to sea and then abandoning the boats .			0
