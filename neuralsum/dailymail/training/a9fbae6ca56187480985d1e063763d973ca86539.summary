@entity0 broached the subject that may yet tarnish the crown of the 2014 world champion — the absurd double points to be awarded at the last race in @entity6			1
if he should lose by that arbitrary and inflated margin it would ‘ suck ’ , he said			2
@entity0 ’s words were less startling than his attire			1
he came to the paddock here dressed as a one - man art gallery			1
@entity0 showed off a chunky gold chain featuring an @entity16 print of @entity18 @entity17 @entity0 strode around the paddock with a new gold chain featuring a replica of an @entity16 painting @entity0 has a ' 44 ' tattoo , signifying his driver number , just behind his right ear at the end of a chunky gold chain hung an @entity16 print of @entity18 sl coupes			1
but back to the points dispute , @entity0 said : ‘ the question is what is fair			1
this is a rule they have brought in for the first time			2
‘ we have to deal with it and hope for the best , but it would suck if that was the case			1
‘ i am not going to let any negative energy into this and what will be will be			0
everyone will be in the same boat			0
‘ you never know what is going to happen but i have been there before and i know what it is like to go to the last race and lose the championship			2
a cyclist rides on the track in @entity52 - a day before practice starts - with the famous stars and stripes displayed a general view of the colourful track at the @entity58 in @entity52 , @entity59 ‘ but i do n’t feel that is going to happen			2
the car has been going great and i hope it will be great for the final three ( races )			2
’ @entity0 takes a 17 - point lead over his @entity18 team - mate @entity65 into sunday ’s race — a more slender margin than it sounds with 100 points on offer between here , @entity71 ( a week on sunday ) and @entity6 ( november 23 )			1
@entity0 , who stopped off for a tv appearance in @entity73 en route to @entity59 , was in a jaunty mood , pleased with his new jewellery			1
‘ i designed it , ’ he said			0
‘ i like designing things and i am into art. i saw the @entity16 painting come up in an auction but the bidding went too far			0
so i got it on a smaller scale — and much more cheaply			0
i can change the art piece and keep the frame			0
’ @entity87 was sporting a new look on thursday , and says he expects a good result this weekend away from the championship battle , 17 - year - old @entity90 will return to the cockpit in practice for @entity94			1
his involvement is a bright spot for a race missing the four cars of @entity99 and @entity100 , the two teams in administration			0
the paddock is still thinking of the stricken @entity104 , the @entity99 driver who was injured in the @entity106 @entity105 a month ago			1
his family said he remains critical but stable in hospital in @entity109			0
‘ @entity104 does indeed continue to fight , ’ they added in a statement			0
in response , the @entity112 are expected to trial a new safety procedure in practice — a compulsory slower lap time when accidents occur but a safety car is not deployed .			0

@entity0 looking to build on 17 - point championship lead
@entity65 *hot* on his tail and will hope to *recover* at @entity123 @entity105
still 100 points on offer , with 50 points for *winner* in @entity6
