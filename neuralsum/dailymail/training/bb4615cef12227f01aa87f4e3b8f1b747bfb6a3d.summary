' the boat trip was a surprise for my mum and dad			2
' i parked up , locked up and we were ready to get on board when i heard my wife shout " the car ! "			0
' watery rescue : the @entity26 was carefully winched out of the canal by a crane not hopeful : the couple , who were about to embark on a boating trip before the accident , do not think their car can be salvaged ' it was already halfway in the canal			2
' quick - thinking staff from @entity51 ’s @entity50 at the marina tied a rope around the roof rack and pulled it from the water before it could sink entirely			1

@entity7 added : ' i think it ’s beyond repair because of the water damage and because the crane had to smash the windows to hoist it out			2
