@entity1 troops with sniper rifles and heavy machine guns have killed hundreds of @entity5 extremists in a series of deadly quad - bike ambushes inside @entity8 , @entity9 can reveal			1
defence sources indicated last night that soldiers from the elite fighting unit have eliminated ‘ up to eight terrorists per day ’ in the daring raids , carried out during the past four weeks			1
until now , it had been acknowledged only that the @entity1 was operating in a reconnaissance role in @entity8 and was not involved in combat			1
but @entity9 has learned that small groups of soldiers are being dropped into @entity21 territory in @entity23 helicopters – to take on the enemy			1
the troops are also equipped with quad bikes – four - wheeled all - terrain vehicles that can have machine guns bolted on to a frame			2
they then seek out is units and attack the terrorists using the element of surprise and under the cover of darkness			2
the missions have taken place on a near daily basis in the past four weeks and the @entity1 soldiers have expended so much ammunition that regimental quartermasters have been forced to order a full replenishment of stocks of machine - gun rounds and sniper bullets			1
an @entity1 source said : ‘ our tactics are putting the fear of @entity67 into is as they do n’t know where we ’re going to strike next and there ’s frankly nothing they can do to stop us			1
@entity1 sniper units scrambled in @entity73 : the heavily equipped troops are flown deep into is territory aboard @entity23 transport helicopters , their quad bikes stowed on board , before touching down 50 miles from their target ‘ we ’re degrading their morale			1
they can run and hide if they see planes in the sky but they ca n’t see or hear us			2
using so many snipers takes the fear factor to another level too ; the terrorists do n’t know what ’s happening			2
they just see their colleagues lying dead in the sand			0
’ the @entity1 ’s guerrilla - style raids are targeting @entity21 ’s main supply routes across western @entity8 and vehicle checkpoints set up by the terrorists to conduct kidnappings and extort money from local drivers			1
the operations start with @entity1 commanders studying hours of footage of potential target sites recorded by drones – @entity105 ( @entity105 ) – and listening to enemy communication intercepts in a bid to identify is leaders			1
once the regiment ’s senior officers have identified a target , the soldiers gather to receive their operational orders			1
they then leave their secret base and climb aboard a fleet of helicopters – with the quad bikes already safely secured in the cargo hold			0
as the @entity1 soldiers strap themselves into their seats , the pilots tap in the co-ordinates for the area of desert where the @entity23 will land			1
as the helicopters ’ engines are so loud , the @entity73 take the @entity1 soldiers to a laying - up point as far as 50 miles from the target			1
the troops disembark aboard the quad bikes and prepare their general - purpose machine guns ( @entity130 ) and @entity132 sniper rifles			0
@entity133 in guerilla - style raids : using precision sniper rifles , machine guns and surprise tactics , the @entity1 take out their is targets before disappearing back into the desert the @entity1 ’s raids are intended to degrade @entity5 ’s fighting capability ahead of a spring offensive by 20,000 @entity8 and @entity144 troops next year , with the @entity145 providing additional training for these soldiers			1
in the next fortnight , defence secretary @entity148 is expected to receive a report from @entity145 military planners setting out what needs to be done			0
the plans could see up to 300 @entity145 trainers leading a programme of intensive training for the @entity144 and @entity8 , with an emphasis on infantry drills and techniques to defuse enemy explosive devices			1
when the spring offensive starts , @entity145 trainers may remain with the @entity8 and @entity144 units but are not expected to get directly involved in the fighting			1
earlier this month , mr @entity148 held meetings with political leaders in the region , assuring them that the @entity145 was committed to defeating @entity21 and improving the training of their soldiers			1
the defence secretary also visited @entity171 , where it is expected that @entity173 and @entity145 commanders will set up a spring offensive planning centre			0
the mission to defeat the 200,000 - strong @entity21 forces will be led by a senior @entity173 officer , lieutenant general @entity178			1
it is likely that his second in command will be a senior @entity145 officer , lieutenant general @entity182			0
next month lieut gen @entity182 will take over as @entity183 for the @entity184 ( @entity185 ) , a post vacated by lieutenant general @entity187 , who is retiring after four years in the role			0
defence sources indicated last night that soldiers from the elite fighting unit have eliminated ‘ up to eight terrorists per day ’ in the daring raids , carried out during the past four weeks but @entity184 experts are questioning whether the @entity145 ’s strategy to defeat @entity21 stands any chance of success			1
professor @entity198 from @entity199 told @entity9 : ‘ not only is the @entity5 stronger than previous organisations , it has also learned lessons from them			0
‘ for example , is has few fixed operational centres and its chain of command remains mobile			0
@entity145 policy options at this stage are burdened with problems and complications and also bring with them a range of unintended consequences that could draw @entity215 powers into further engagements in the region			2
‘ with regard to the spring offensive , the @entity144 would not be able to push further south into @entity8 without upsetting the @entity221 tribesmen in these areas and the @entity8 army is regarded as a @entity225 militia			1
so we are a long way off a practical solution to the problem of @entity21			1
’ the @entity9 has learned that since @entity21 began its campaign in @entity231 and @entity8 , more than 35 @entity145 jihadists have lost their lives			1
it is believed the most recent @entity145 citizens to die fighting for the extremists – known as @entity237 , 21 , and @entity238 , 20 – were from @entity239			0
they are understood to have been killed in @entity173 air strikes on the @entity231 border town of @entity242			0
@entity243 grew up in @entity239 in a @entity145 - @entity245 family and converted to @entity246 when he was 16			0
in august , @entity247 told the @entity248 he had gone to @entity231 nine months earlier and had been fighting both there and in @entity8			2
@entity243 is thought to have appeared in at least two is videos posted online			0
@entity238 comes from a @entity145 - @entity253 background and grew up in @entity254			0
he travelled to @entity231 in december 2013 , entering via @entity255			0
it is believed that @entity238 was questioned by counter-terrorism police at a @entity145 airport as he left but was allowed on his journey because they were satisfied with the explanation he gave for the purpose of his trip			0
intelligence sources have indicated that more than 500 @entity145 are currently fighting for @entity21 , with the vast majority active in @entity231			2
yesterday , the widow of murdered @entity145 aid worker @entity269 told a memorial service he was killed ‘ for being what we should be , selfless and caring ’			0
a video showing the beheading of the 47 - year - old taxi driver was released by @entity21 last month			2
a private memorial service at @entity278 parish church in @entity279 was held yesterday , with audio relayed outside			0
his widow @entity281 and daughter @entity283 walked in with @entity284 and @entity285 , the daughter and brother of @entity288 from @entity289 , @entity290 , also murdered by @entity21			2
mrs @entity291 told the memorial : ‘ we must never forget the reason why he went to @entity231 and the reason he was taken from us – for being what we all should be , selfless and caring			0
’ meanwhile , is militants have killed at least 25 members of a @entity301 tribe in a village on the eastern edge of @entity304 in @entity8 , in apparent revenge for tribal opposition to the radical @entity246			2
local officials said the bodies of the men from the @entity311 tribe were discovered by the @entity8 army when it launched a counter-offensive on saturday against @entity21 near @entity304 , capital of @entity314			1
' @entity317 tragedy ' general set to lead offensive new man : lieut general @entity182 a former @entity321 officer who was in charge of six @entity323 brutally killed by a mob of extremists in @entity8 is in line to become the second in command of coalition operations against @entity21			1
lieutenant general @entity182 has been appointed @entity183 for the @entity184 ( @entity185 ) and will take up his position as the @entity145 steps up its efforts to train @entity8 and @entity144 forces to defeat @entity5			2
softly spoken @entity182 gen @entity182 first deployed to @entity8 in 2003 , when the tragedy of the @entity323 marked the beginning of an insurgency against the @entity145 presence in the country ’s southern provinces			2
at the time , the @entity323 , or @entity339 , were attached to the @entity321 ’s @entity340 led by @entity182			0
eleven years on , families of the @entity323 still blame senior officers for their deaths			0
lieut gen @entity182 is taking over as @entity185 following the retirement of lieutenant general @entity187 – an officer who was considered the @entity347 ’s leading expert on @entity349 affairs			0
lieut gen @entity187 served as @entity185 for four years but his retirement comes only three months after the prime minister also appointed him to serve as his special envoy to @entity144 – a key role during the is crisis			0
last night , @entity184 expert professor @entity198 described lieut gen @entity187 ’s retirement as a ‘ blow ’ because of his understanding of regional politics and jihad philosophy .			0
