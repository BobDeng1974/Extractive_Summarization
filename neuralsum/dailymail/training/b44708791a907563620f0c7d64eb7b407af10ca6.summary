by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter almost 50 @entity5 diplomats and members of their families have been charged in a massive health care fraud scheme , officials announced thursday			1
federal officials allege that 58 of the 63 births to @entity5 officials living in @entity12 between 2004 and 2013 were fraudulently paid for by @entity13 at a cost of roughly $ 1.5million to @entity16 taxpayers			2
the @entity5 were applying for these benefits while emptying their pockets at famed stores such as @entity21 ’s , @entity22 ’s , @entity23 and @entity24 , officials said			2
‘ being a diplomat does not give you the right to commit health care fraud , ’ @entity30 special agent in charge of the @entity12 field office @entity31 said during a thursday news conference detailing the allegations			0
the diplomats and their spouses were able to exploit a loop hole allowing them to apply for benefits without proving @entity16 citizenship because the child is presumed to acquire @entity16 citizenship at birth			1
diplomats , their spouses and their children are not generally entitled to @entity13 benefits except in cases of emergency , officials noted			1
‘ as the complaint alleges , the scam exploited a weakness in the @entity71 system , and the charges expose shameful and systemic corruption among @entity5 diplomats in @entity12 , ’ @entity66 @entity16 attorney @entity27 said			1
by under reporting income by thousands of dollars per month , having income statements verified by various official offices and even claiming spouses were brothers , expectant @entity5 mothers wed to diplomats were able to carry out the fraud			2
lying to city and state claims processors provided them with @entity13 benefits for prenatal care , birth and young children – which they were not entitled to receive			1
‘ diplomacy should be about extending hands , not picking pockets in the host country , ’ mr @entity91 added			0
center of the scheme : the fraud originated out of the @entity5 consulate in @entity12 ( pictured above ) two diplomats falsely stated they were brother and sister instead of spouses , entitling them to more than $ 21,000 in benefits			1
three others provided documents showing their children were @entity16 citizens when in fact they were @entity5 nationals living in @entity12			0
the defendants received hundreds of thousands of dollars in @entity13 income while spending tens of thousands on cruises , watches , shows , jewelry and other luxuries			1
‘ the pattern of spending by the @entity5 diplomats and their spouses , including the defendants , is generally inconsistent with the grossly underreported incomes claimed on the @entity71 applications , ’ the criminal complaint said			2
the fraud was pervasive at all levels of @entity5 ’s diplomatic mission in @entity12 , officials said			0
tens of thousands : diplomats dropped thousands at @entity21 's , @entity23 and the @entity131 while receiving benefits @entity133 , a former diplomat at the @entity135 , and his wife , @entity136 applied for benefits stating mr @entity133 ’s income to be $ 3,000 a month at the same time he applied for a credit card saying his income was more than $ 8,000 a month			1
the couple received more than $ 30,000 in benefits during a period they spent over $ 50,000 on purchases including in excess of $ 8,400 at the @entity131 and $ 10,000 each at several retailers including @entity21 ’s and @entity23			2
their documents were signed off on by @entity149 – falsely confirming an underreporting of the couple ’s income			0
@entity153 and @entity154 reported their income to be almost half of what it actually was , they also received @entity13 benefits while hoarding tens of thousands of dollars in good from @entity162 and @entity163			1
shopping spree : the diplomats and their wives spent tens of thousands at @entity24 's while receiving benefits ‘ all sorts of lavish spending was going on , ’ mr @entity91 lamented			1
@entity5 officials did n’t take the announcement lightly , saying through state news agency @entity172 that ‘ russophobic forces ’ are conspiring to spoil @entity5 - @entity16 relations			0
the complaint asks for the @entity5 government to arrest and hand over all 49 officials accused in the fraud – 11 are currently in the @entity16 , the rest have returned to @entity5			0
diplomats have immunity from criminal prosecution , which will likely shield them from ever having to answer the charges			0
‘ all of these defendants have diplomatic immunity due to the nature of their work for the @entity5 government , ’ said mr @entity91			0
@entity16 officials can ask for that immunity to be revoked , but @entity5 officials do n’t appear to take the charges seriously enough to comply .			0

almost 50 diplomats and family members took part in the scam
incomes , citizenship and relationships were falsely stated to obtain @entity13 benefits
diplomats and wives dropped tens of thousands in high - end @entity66 stores while receiving benefits
