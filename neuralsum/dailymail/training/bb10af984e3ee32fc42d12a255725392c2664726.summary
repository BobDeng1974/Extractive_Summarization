' after six years of fighting for justice we are grateful to the jury for finding a huge catalogue of police failures , ' they added			1

a damning report released by the @entity163 ( @entity163 ) concluded there was a number of failings by @entity17 , including missed chances to arrest @entity136 before the killings			0

in march , it was revealed that police had failed to attend a call just hours before a mother was brutally murdered by her jealous ex-partner			0

mrs @entity177 called police at 2.30pm on july 24 , 2011 , to inform them she was being harassed by @entity179 and arranged for officers to check up on her at 4.30pm			0
but police failed to attend the arranged meeting and only came hours later when a panic alarm was sounded during the frenzied attack at around 7.30pm			2
' i have made it a personal mission that a situation like hers must never be allowed to happen again			0
' protecting every single person at risk of domestic abuse is a huge challenge for the police and our partners , but it is one we are determined to meet			0
' in may last year , the @entity163 judged @entity17 ' missed a large number of opportunities ' to deal with ms @entity9 ' case before she was killed			1
it concluded : ' it is ironic that ms @entity9 was offered the most support and protection while @entity6 was in prison , when the risk from him was minimal			1
' when he was released both she and her son were left completely vulnerable			0
. ' all the risks that were there when ms @entity9 called the police in july still existed after his release ; indeed arguably the risk was even higher , as @entity6 had just served several months in prison as a result of her complaint			1
' ms @entity9 was then murdered by @entity6 and her son has endured profound and ongoing trauma as a result of his mother 's brutal death			1
