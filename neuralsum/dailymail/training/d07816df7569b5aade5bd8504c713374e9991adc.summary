@entity3 's latest concept car might not look radical from the outside , but inside its boasts a range of outlandish gadgets that would make @entity6 proud @entity3 says this system could be used on and off - road , from coupling a trailer to spotting obstacles during extreme off - road driving			1
the off - road remote operation function has been dubbed @entity31 and the company claims that it will be ‘ semi-autonomous			2
’ off - road exploring is further helped by something known as ‘ @entity35 ’ which measures depth in patches of water to prevent the vehicle from getting stuck			2

this video image is then transmitted digitally to a @entity71 of the type already used on many luxury and executive cars to project sat - nav and speed details onto the windscreen			2
the virtual image of the ground is superimposed over the actual image of the bonnet			0
this allows the driver to look through the windscreen and apparently ‘ see - through ’ the front of the car			1
the ‘ see through ’ bonnet meanwhile combines cameras in the grille and jet - fighter - style head - up display technology on the windscreen			1
although designed principally for those who want to better spot rocky terrain or deep crevices when they take their @entity94 seriously off - road , it could even have some use in the urban jungle by allowing drivers to spot and avoid potholes lurking just out of sight			0
the car will also be practical with a huge boot and seating for up to seven , with the arrangement operated by touchscreen			0
