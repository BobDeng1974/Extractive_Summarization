pet cats are being infected by tuberculosis and could pass the disease on to the owners , vets say cats could pass on deadly bovine tuberculosis to their owners , according to vets			1
adventurous felines are catching the disease during their exploration of badger setts or by coming into contact with rodents who have done the same			0
they can also pick up bovine tb directly from cattle or infected milk			1
now experts says vets should be more aware that domestic cats can carry the disease			1
' the real issue with cats with @entity27 is that unless they are feral , they tend to have close contact with humans , ' @entity23 , former president of the @entity24 , told the @entity32			1
' that is where you ramp up a degree of the public health risk through direct contact with cats that have @entity27 and that is where i see the importance rather than driving the outbreak among cattle			1
' scientists at the @entity47 say that as many as 100 out of every 100,000 cats could have a form of tuberculosis , more than previously thought			1
a fifth of those are thought to be infected by @entity53 - the strain found in cattle and badgers			1
most were caused by @entity56 , usually found in voles			0
professor @entity58 , who led the study , told the newspaper : ' you need to be aware that cats are acting as sentinels for other small furries that are infected			2
' you might clear the cattle , but if you do n’t clear the cats as well , you could potentially get reinfection			2
' the @entity69 team found that , in one year , 17 per cent of the 187 reported cases of @entity27 in cats were caused by the bovine strain			2
their findings have been published in the journal of @entity75 and @entity76			0
government figures show that only 80 cases of bovine tb in cats have been reported to the @entity81 since 2009 , with nine of those reported last year			0
mr @entity23 welcomed the @entity69 findings and said the low number of cases was likely to be caused by vets being unaware that they should look out for feline tuberculosis			0
but he also told the @entity32 that there was no suggestion that cats are the main spreader of @entity27 and said the pets do not pose a major health risk to humans			1
chief veterinary officer @entity95 told @entity96 ’s @entity97 : ' [ @entity98 ] roam and do explore and could get into fights with feral cats and badgers themselves			2
cats could pick up @entity53 from badger setts , rodents that have been in badger setts or with fights with badgers themselves ' there is a threat to humans			1
if an animal has an unresolving bite wound or a respiratory problem that wo n’t go away , they should talk to their vets , and vets need to bear this in mind			0
' transmission to people is possible and has happened but the number of cases in pets is low and so the possibility of this is low			0
' between 1994 and 2011 there were 570 cases of bovine tuberculosis in humans			2
those with the cattle strain of the illness were mainly over the age of 65 and had drunk infected unpasteurised milk			2
less than 1 per cent of the 8,963 human cases of @entity27 in 2011 were caused by @entity53			0
about 5,000 badgers are due to be culled in @entity137 and @entity138 before the end of the year because authorities say they spread tuberculosis among cattle			1
badgers are blamed for spreading the disease to livestock , devastating herds and costing dairy farmers and the taxpayer millions of pounds a year			0
ministers say that unless everything possible is done to control the disease , the bill to the country will top £ 1billion over the next decade			0
but critics favour other methods , including vaccination , and say that the science behind the cull is not sound .			0

as many as 100 out of every 100,000 cats carry tuberculosis , experts say
about a fifth infected by @entity53 , found in cattle and badgers
close contact with humans ' ramps up degree of public health risk '
