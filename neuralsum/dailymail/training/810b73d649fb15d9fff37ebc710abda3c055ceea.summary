the governing body held a board meeting on thursday to discuss the matter of unpaid dividend payments from the @entity0 ' period in administration last season after the @entity5 club had sought a reduction to the £ 600,000 figure			2
they felt a previous payment of £ 300,000 to @entity1 , whose dispute with the club led to the @entity0 playing their home matches at @entity23 's @entity22 last year , should have been taken into account along with further costs incurred during the liquidation of the club 's old operating company			1

the @entity3 's chief executive @entity40 said : ' this has been a complex and unwelcome disagreement within a wider , more significant dispute			2
