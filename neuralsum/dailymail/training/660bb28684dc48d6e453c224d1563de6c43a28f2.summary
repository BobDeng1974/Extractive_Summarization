the finest golfer in world watched his ball scuttle across the eighth green , and winced in anguish as the putt died a premature death			2
there was a muted gasp from the gallery , then a desperate voice cried : ‘ it ’s all right , @entity11 ! do n’t worry , it ’s all right			2
’ a shadow of a smile crossed @entity16 ’s face , his colleague @entity17 tidied up the lapse , and the players moved on			1
and yet , it was a strangely revealing moment , one which reminded us that this remarkable man is just 25 years old ; blessed with prodigious talent , bearing onerous responsibilities , yet still capable of arousing the protective instinct in total strangers			2
@entity28 ( left ) and @entity16 ( right ) embrace in celebration as they secure a point for @entity32 @entity17 ( left ) and @entity16 ( right ) celebrate during their @entity34 foursomes victory reunited @entity32 pairing @entity16 ( left ) and @entity17 defeated @entity36 duo @entity35 and @entity37 it 's not over yet - the @entity34 can go either way he moves around the course on a wave of affection , people call his name with the familiarity of old friends			1
yet the demands are daunting			2
after what he has achieved , excellence is the very least we expect			2
the wonder is that he keeps both his sanity and his good humour ; riding the wave as if he still can not quite believe his luck			2
if @entity32 are to win the @entity34 on sunday , then @entity16 ’s contribution may prove crucial			1
such is the stature of his talent , and such the influence he exerts within his team			1
he spent saturday morning ’s fourball effectively nursing @entity64 towards simple competence			1
there was no grandstanding , no demonstrations of obvious authority , but the most casual observer would have discerned the senior partner			0
when @entity64 finally flowered , @entity16 slapped his back and shared his joy			1
it was a genuinely impressive performance			0
in the afternoon , with @entity17 , his nursing duties were similarly in evidence			1
again , there was no exhibitionism , no signs of impatience			0
@entity17 was thankful : ‘ i think @entity11 beat three guys today , not just two , ’ he said			1
’ @entity16 beamed his embarrassment			1
‘ i ’m very lucky with my partners , ’ he said , and sounded as if he meant it			0
tight - knit duo @entity17 ( left ) and @entity16 support each other as @entity32 stars walk on the course click here to read the report from saturday 's @entity91 action the fact that @entity32 are taking control of this @entity34 simply reinforced their mood of mutual admiration , but the dominance is clearly based on collective class			1
and it is @entity16 who sets the standards			1
another small cameo spoke volumes			0
at the ninth , with @entity16 and @entity17 clinging to their one - hole lead , @entity11 contemplated the distant green , selected a long iron , and spanked the ball through several postcodes to the very heart of the green			1
as the ball left the club , his captain and countryman @entity113 gasped : ‘ that ’s a great shot , @entity11 ! a great shot ! ’ the words were spoken in awed tones , a full second before the import of the stroke had registered with the galleries			2
@entity17 just shook his head , smiled his delight and bowled along to the distant green , knowing his game was in good hands			1
that ability to dispatch the ball a country mile is perhaps the most spectacular trait of @entity16 ’s game			1
those who truly understand the mechanics of the golf swing could doubtless explain how a man standing 5ft 9in tall and weighing 11st 5lb can generate such stunning power			0
the rest of us can only watch and wonder			0
and the crowds just revere him , partly through his genius , partly because of the affability of his bearing			0
people talk to him , joke with him , as they would a favourite brother			0
@entity32 's @entity17 of @entity145 and @entity16 of @entity146 line up a putt on saturday @entity17 and @entity16 of @entity32 congratulate each other during their afternoon session @entity16 and @entity151 's awesome foursome scorecard shows their perfect partnership at the sixth tee on saturday afternoon , he dived into the tee - side toilet while waiting for the crowd to clear the green			1
when he emerged , a solicitous matron inquired : ‘ better now ? ’ he gave her a nod			0
‘ much better , thanks , ’ he responded , and carried on with the @entity34			1
it was scarcely @entity161 wit , but others would have ignored the woman			0
that is obviously not his way			0
the people responsible for raising and rearing the impressive young man were following his every shot on saturday			2
his father , @entity169 , faded into the small squad of people who follow the players inside the ropes			0
clutching a white woolly hat , he looked on anonymously as his son went to work			0
his mother , @entity176 , kept a similarly low profile as she huddled on the caddy cart chugging behind the pack			0
there was no show , no seeking cheap attention			0
that is not the way of folk in their little corner of @entity188			0
but their pride in the boy was unmistakable			0
he was a credit to them , a credit to @entity194			0
only once did he come close to anger , and that on the seventh fairway , when the match referee belatedly ruled that it was the @entity36 turn to play while @entity16 was standing over his ball			1
@entity32 star @entity16 looks relaxed after a fine day at @entity200 on saturday against @entity36 ‘ but i ’m ready ! ’ he protested			1
‘ ca n’t you see i ’m ready ? ’ he thrust his iron back into his bag , and then , after a second ’s reflection , he giggled like a small boy , and got on with the game			2
everyone chuckled , conspiring in the moment			0
on saturday , he could do no wrong			2
so on he went , intimidating tremendous players like @entity35 and @entity37 by the sheer force of his ability			1
and he brought his partner , @entity17 , home by a handsome 3 & 2			1
more heroics will be required from him on sunday , of course			2
more minor miracles , more shots which are beyond the scope or imagination of ordinary golfers			0
but there is no sign as yet that the pressure is weighing heavily upon him			0
indeed , he actually seems to revel in the impudent expectations			0
it has something to do with his youth , much to do with his talent , and just about everything to do with his personality			2
for at the moment , and along with the dazzlingly excellent @entity232 , @entity16 seems to own @entity200			1
he is a credit to his sport , a credit to @entity32 , most importantly , he is a credit to @entity194 , @entity188			1
you suspect he would settle for that			0
@entity32 take a healthy 10 - 6 lead into sunday 's play against @entity36 as the @entity91 gets settled @entity16 of @entity32 will be instrumental in the team 's ability to beat @entity36 in the @entity91 @entity232 and @entity243 vs @entity244 and @entity245 - @entity32 win 3 & 2 @entity246 and @entity247 vs @entity35 and @entity37 - @entity36 win 4 & 3 @entity248 and @entity249 vs @entity250 and @entity251 - @entity36 win 5 & 3 @entity16 and @entity64 vs @entity252 and @entity254 - match halved @entity246 and @entity247 vs @entity255 and @entity245 - @entity32 win 2 & 1 @entity249 and @entity232 vs @entity251 and @entity250 - match halved @entity17 and @entity16 vs @entity35 and @entity37 - @entity32 win 3 & 2 @entity257 and @entity258 vs @entity252 and @entity254 - @entity32 win 5 & 4			1

@entity32 's @entity17 and @entity16 beat @entity36 's @entity35 and @entity37 3 & 2 on saturday afternoon at @entity200 in 2014 @entity34
@entity16 and @entity64 halved with @entity36 's @entity252 and @entity254 during the morning session
if @entity32 are to win the @entity34 on sunday , then @entity16 ’s contribution may prove crucial with his talent and influence on the whole team
@entity32 take a 10 - 6 lead into sunday 's @entity91 finale
