the disaster unfolding in @entity1 was branded ‘ @entity3 ’s legacy ’ last night as @entity4 ruled out military intervention			1
though @entity8 extremists are threatening to seize @entity9 , foreign secretary @entity6 said @entity4 was ‘ not contemplating ’ any form of action , and @entity11 chief @entity10 said there was no role for the alliance			0
@entity18 president @entity17 insisted his country had an interest in stopping jihadists taking control and said he was looking at ‘ all options ’ , including drone strikes			0
@entity1 is facing a return to its darkest days after @entity27 - linked militants seized a huge swathe of the @entity1 ’s northern region and vowed to press on to the capital			1
the collapse of @entity1 and the impending disaster was last night branded as ' @entity3 's legacy ' after the former prime minister , left , agreed to @entity36 's middle east war , left the developments have reignited debate over the wisdom of the decision of mr @entity3 and @entity18 president @entity36 to invade @entity1 in 2003 , at the cost of 179 @entity4 lives and at least £ 9 billion			1
critics say the @entity18 and @entity4 governments of the time failed to prepare properly for the aftermath of the invasion			0
in 2007 , mr @entity36 ordered a ‘ surge ’ of troops to quell insurgency , but in 2011 , the last @entity4 forces pulled out of @entity1			1
researchers have estimated that as many as half a million @entity1 have died as a result of the conflict , though the figure is hotly disputed			1
@entity57 minister @entity56 , a @entity58 who is a longstanding opponent of the @entity59 , told the @entity60 : ‘ @entity61 was a dictator who gassed his own people , but the country was stable , in a vile sort of way			1
‘ the reality is that the intervention by @entity3 and @entity36 has destabilised this country and left it open to extremism , and we are seeing that now			0
@entity1 today is @entity3 ’s legacy			1
’ the accusation was made by @entity58 mp and home affairs minister @entity56 who said @entity3 's decision to go to war in @entity1 has left the country ' open to extremism ' conservative mp @entity76 , who resigned from his party ’s front bench to vote against the @entity1 conflict , said events in the country demonstrated the folly of intervention across the @entity83			1
‘ one of the dangers of invading @entity1 is that we underestimated the religious tensions and the resources needed to leave robust structures in place when the @entity91 left			1
a weakened @entity1 was always going to be more susceptible to extremism , ’ he said			1
‘ other examples include @entity94 , and possibly @entity96			0
in @entity94 , a weak central government has been unable to establish its authority over militias			2
in @entity96 , @entity100 confidence that the @entity96 security forces will be able to hold the line surely needs re-evaluating after these events			0
” ‘ all in all , such developments once again bring into question the wisdom of our recent interventions			0
’ @entity108 militants from the self - proclaimed @entity109 ( @entity109 ) , pictured , have seized @entity110 and @entity111 after heavy fighting mr @entity6 said there was no prospect of the @entity4 offering military assistance of any kind to @entity1 , though the government is providing humanitarian support			1
the @entity119 confirmed that a team of experts have been sent to the country after two major cities , @entity110 and @entity111 , fell to insurgents from the @entity109 ( @entity109 )			2
‘ no military assistance has been requested from the @entity4 , we 're not contemplating military intervention or assistance from the @entity4 , ’ mr @entity6 said			0
‘ we are considering what we can do to relieve the humanitarian pressures caused by the displacement of hundreds of thousands of people , that is something that the @entity4 is well - placed to provide			0
’ mr @entity6 insisted that the @entity1 authorities – which failed even to persuade enough mps to turn up to parliament to vote on a request by prime minister @entity139 to declare a state of emergency – form a more effective consensus between the country ’s rival religious and ethnic groups			1
‘ it is very much an issue for the @entity1 leaders to make sure that together they form a political unity and consensus to deal with this involving @entity151 , @entity152 and @entity153 working together			1
we look to the @entity1 government to do that , ’ the foreign secretary said			1
deputy prime minister @entity157 said he also opposed military action , referring to the 2003 war : ‘ i do n't think having made one mistake you repeat it by making a second one			0
’ deputy prime minister @entity157 , speaking on his radio show ruled out any further military intervention in @entity1 claiming ' i do n't think having made one mistake you repeat it by making a second ' mr @entity157 said the @entity1 was now in a ‘ very , very dangerous situation ’ and were in part due to the knock - on effects of the civil war in @entity172			2
the deputy prime minister told his @entity174 phone - in that his view was that the legal basis for the invasion of @entity1 in 2003 was ‘ very shaky ’ , adding : ‘ i personally do not think legality was ever proved			2
my party was alone in thinking at the time , as the @entity182 and @entity183 parties both argued for the invasion of @entity1 , that we should n’t have invaded @entity1 in the first place			2
‘ this porous border between @entity172 and @entity1 is really becoming the absolute fulcrum for ever more organised violent forces usurping the government of @entity1 and occupying as you say , very large parts of that part of the world			1
‘ it is an incredibly serious situation but at the end of the day the only way that this is going to start turning around is if the violence subsides in @entity172 and politics can start taking root where violence at the moment is raging			0
’ @entity205 , an @entity1 - born @entity182 mp who is a member of @entity207 ’s policy board , said @entity4 's failure to intervene in @entity172 has fuelled @entity1 ’s descent into civil war			2
he also blamed the decision of @entity212 , the head of the occupational authority in @entity1 following the invasion , to disband the 700,000 - man @entity215 11 years ago			2
@entity218 last summer said he wanted to launch airstrikes on @entity172 , but the plan was scrapped after @entity221 and some conservative backbenchers voted it down in the @entity223			0
mr @entity205 told @entity224 ’s today programme : ‘ i argued for very limited intervention to take the chemical weapons out of the game in @entity172 to protect the silent majority of innocent people			0
‘ early intervention in @entity172 , supporting people who were working towards replacing @entity233 with a moderate democracy which is inclusive would have been the right move			0
‘ otherwise the message you send to the silent majority is actually you do n't care about them			0
that is where these groups thrive because they go in and they are brutal and they take over and fill that vacuum			0
