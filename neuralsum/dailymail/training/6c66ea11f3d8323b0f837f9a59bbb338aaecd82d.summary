count @entity7 , whose bed - hopping , colourful life was said to be the model for @entity10 , wanted to leave ownership of @entity12 off the coast of the @entity14 to the nation , but a rare decision the @entity17 rejected the offer			1
the conservation charity said they rejected the island because @entity12 is not ' significant ' enough to warrant the cost it would take to keep			1
island aristocrat : count @entity7 preferred his small farmhouse on the @entity27 island of @entity28 , which he owned , to a castle			2
he served as a ' cover identity ' for fiction 's most famous spy read more : @entity33 on @entity34 @entity1 on @entity35 only a few weeks ago , the @entity17 described the bequest as " an extraordinary act of generosity from a man who led an extraordinary life			2
' however , a spokesman for the @entity4 , confirmed that in recent years it has not taken charge of heritage properties without an endowment to help meet their maintenance costs			1
' with regret , the @entity4 is declining the generous bequest of the island of @entity12 made by the late count @entity51 , ’ he said			1
' we have taken this decision having made a full assessment of the island in terms of its heritage significance			0
' whilst it is of undoubted value , it would not bridge any gaps within our existing portfolio of nationally important properties and would incur significant cost obligations			0
unspoiled : the beach on the island of @entity12 which the @entity4 of @entity5 have rejected after being left it in the will of count @entity7 ' the property did not come with an endowment and we would have had to draw resources away from other , more significant sites to meet those obligations			1
' this is not to say that we do not welcome bequests of property but we had no prior warning of the count 's intentions and if we had , we might have been able to propose different alternatives in his lifetime			0
' if anyone is considering leaving a historic property or landscape to the @entity4 , we would always urge them to make contact with us at the earliest stage			0
picturesque : the view over the islands just off the @entity14 ' it is our understanding that , in accordance with count @entity7 ' will , @entity12 will now be subsumed within the rest of his estate and be passed on to a family member as per his wishes			1
' however a group of crofters has been preparing to launch a community buy - out of the uninhabited island - and neighbouring @entity28 where the count was laird of the 230 - strong community			2
crofters hope to use right - to - buy legislation to take ownership of the 250 - acre island and the larger @entity112 , which has been left to the count 's grandson @entity113			1
however , @entity116 - based solicitor @entity115 , whose office has been dealing with the count 's estate , said there are no current plans for sale			2
the count 's son @entity123 - the 50 - year - old mayor of @entity125 in @entity126 - from a long relationship with @entity128 of @entity129 , a granddaughter of @entity130 , was disinherited by his father			0
clear blue sea : the uninhibited island of @entity12 donated to , but rejected by the @entity4 count @entity7 , who once acted as the @entity135 - and was a descendant of @entity137 of @entity138 - died at the age of 87 in june			1
he left instructions for @entity12 to be gifted to the @entity17 the close friend of 007 author @entity142 once jokingly promised in a radio interview to leave the island to @entity145			1
in 1996 the @entity146 , prince @entity147 and @entity148 explored the island and dined by the sea during a cruise of the @entity27 aboard the @entity152			0
the island , which has been referred to as ' one of the last specks of land before @entity157 ' , boasts fertile soil , golden sandy beaches and a ruined church which , according to folklore , has its own resident spectre			0
in 2000 the count touted the isle to tv producers as the ideal place to film a reality show featuring castaway city - dwellers			0
@entity169 : count @entity7 's success with glamorous , well - heeled women was also mirrored in the @entity10 novels but it was in august that solicitor @entity115 , who has been dealing with the estate of the count , revealed that @entity12 would be given to the @entity177 - based @entity17 @entity17 officials , who already maintain the islands of @entity180 and @entity181 in the @entity27 , were astonished by the development			1
@entity183 , the @entity4 's development manager for legacies , said then : ' this is an extraordinary act of generosity from a man who led an extraordinary life			0
' once we receive official confirmation we will assess the island 's ecology and landscape as to how it can be best conserved for the nation in the light of any conditions attached to the bequest			0
' however @entity17 has also come under recent criticism for its stewardship on @entity180 where since 2010 , 20 residents - five sevenths of the population - have left or declared their intention to leave			1
@entity12 has been uninhabited for more than 150 years			2
influence : count @entity7 was deeply involved in helping @entity142 ( left ) research @entity10 ’s adventures for the novel @entity209			1

he assisted @entity142 with research for @entity209 and @entity10 's cover role in the story - a heraldic researcher at the @entity218 in @entity219 - was based on the aristocrat , who served in that post between 1952 and 1967			2
the count also came up with the phrase ' the world is not enough ' , which became the spy 's motto , and many years after @entity142 's death , the title of a @entity10 movie			1
in 1993 , the one - time multimillionaire briefly put @entity12 up for sale after discovering his fortune was fast evaporating			2
