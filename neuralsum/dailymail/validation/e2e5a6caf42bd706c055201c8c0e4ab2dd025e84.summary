@entity1 boss @entity0 insists he has no problem with his @entity4 counterpart @entity3 following the latter 's comments about the size of the two @entity9 duo			1
prior to tuesday 's @entity15 clash between the teams , @entity3 - a contender to take over as @entity1 boss in the recent past - described @entity1 as a ' good little club ' before expressing his delight at having landed the manager 's job at a ' massive football club ' like @entity4			1
then , after his side won 2 - 1 in the game at @entity22 , @entity3 again made an apparent dig at @entity1 , saying they will ' have to improve ' for the next meeting - saturday 's @entity26 quarter - final at the same venue - if they are going stop the hosts triumphing again			1
@entity1 manager @entity0 insists he does not have a problem with @entity4 manager @entity3 @entity3 said @entity1 were a ' good little club ' ahead of @entity4 's 2 - 1 win against the @entity1 but @entity0 said ahead of this weekend 's derby : ' that is @entity3 - there are no problems with me or the chairman at all			1
' @entity3 is @entity3 and he will be good fun for everyone around the @entity40 for the time he is at @entity4 i 'm sure			1
' @entity0 stressed @entity1 will not need to use either the words of @entity3 , for whom the win on tuesday was his first since taking the @entity4 post last month , or the disappointment of their defeat in that game to generate any additional motivation for saturday 's contest			1
with his players only one match away from a @entity56 semi-final , @entity0 - a beaten @entity26 finalist in 2011 as @entity52 boss - said : ' i do n't need to pin that ( @entity3 's comments ) up in the changing room			1
' we have a good group of lads here and they will want to win the game as much as @entity4 will			0
' i do n't think we need any ( extra ) motivation			0
it 's a local derby , it 's the quarter - final of the @entity26 and it 's absolutely wonderful that we 've got to this stage			1
these are big games that everybody should look forward to and we will certainly be looking forward to it			0
' we 've got as good a chance ( of winning the competition ) as any of the eight teams left in there			0
' you go and ask @entity76			0
they will fancy winning it as well			0
' @entity1 defeated non-league side @entity80 7 - 0 in @entity0 ' first official game in charge of the @entity1 @entity0 ' first game officially in charge of @entity1 following his appointment in january was the 7 - 0 @entity26 third - round victory over non-league @entity80 at the @entity87			1
since then , @entity1 's run in the tournament has also seen them win 2 - 1 at @entity90 and 4 - 0 at home against @entity92			2
overall , the @entity1 have lost only twice in their 11 games in all competitions under @entity0 so far			2
and asked if he had underestimated @entity4 on tuesday night , the 57 - year - old said : ' i have great respect for every club and every team			2
' from the third round right the way through , and in every game we play in the @entity15 or anything else - i have total respect for clubs , the people there and the supporters			0
' i never underestimate anyone			0
i 've been in the game too long to do that			0
' @entity1 will be without injured forward @entity113 ( groin ) and cup - tied midfielder @entity115 for saturday 's tie			2
@entity0 says he has a few ' knocks and niggles ' in his squad to assess - winger @entity120 ( foot ) is a doubt , while forwards @entity123 and @entity125 have both been playing recently with pain - killing injections			0
@entity0 also said the club ' have to go carefully ' with @entity128 , with the forward understood to have suffered a family bereavement , and it remains to be seen whether goalkeeper @entity131 keeps his place after his costly late error in tuesday 's loss .			2
