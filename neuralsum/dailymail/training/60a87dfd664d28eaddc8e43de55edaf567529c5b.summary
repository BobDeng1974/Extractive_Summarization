‘ when i first saw this house i just felt like it hugged me			0
it was the most wonderful feeling			0
you see the brochure and you think , “ gosh , it ’s an enormous house , ” but you walk in and actually it ’s really cosy			0
‘ we live in the whole house			0
it ’s just me and @entity47 – the children come and go because they ’re all grown up – but we use every bit of the property			0
’ one of the bathrooms in the mansion - it also has a tennis court , stables , a six - car garage and ' party barn ' explaining why they are now selling , @entity49 says : ‘ we ’re both about to turn 60 and it would be good to think , that if anything happens to either of us , we would n’t have so much responsibility			1

@entity187 , of selling agents @entity188 , says : ‘ @entity6 is the perfect estate within reach of everything an international or @entity194 - centric buyer might need			2
