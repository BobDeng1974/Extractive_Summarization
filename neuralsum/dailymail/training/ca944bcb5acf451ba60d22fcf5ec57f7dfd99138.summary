by @entity1 - @entity0 found just off the buzzing @entity3 near @entity4 in @entity5 , no 4 @entity2 is a proper ‘ @entity7 ’ address			1
so it was , perhaps , the perfect home for legendary singer @entity10 , whose classic chart hit @entity7 has become something of a signature tune			1
indeed , @entity10 loved the house so much that she kept an eye on it after she moved out , even asking its new owners if she could have a look round			1
@entity10 lived in the five - bedroom townhouse in the 1980s – and was n’t the street ’s first famous resident			1
@entity2 is the fictional home of @entity22 , while architect @entity23 , who designed the @entity25 ’s building and the @entity26 , lived at @entity27			1

one of his best - known films , @entity39 , which starred @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43 , was set in an empty house opposite			2
no 4 is now owned by financial adviser @entity45 , 58 , and his wife @entity46 , 52 , who moved there in 1998			2
their daughter @entity48 , 26 , was living there when @entity10 , who had downsized a few streets away , called			1
‘ she was nice ; the house must have meant a lot to her , ’ @entity48 says			0
inspired : the light and airy first - floor sitting room of the @entity5 property in @entity58 and though @entity10 , now 81 , has sold 68 million records , appeared in 30 films and had a new album out last year , @entity48 admitted : ‘ i did n’t know who she was ! ’ but it ’s no surprise that @entity10 had fond memories of her former home			1
it is an impressive early @entity68 , stucco - fronted , five - bedroom , four - bathroom family home offering bright , flexible and spacious accommodation			1
the house benefits from a commanding position by the gravelled open space originally intended as a carriageway leading to the @entity75			0
it has a large south - west - facing terrace			2
mr @entity45 is now selling it with a price tag of £ 5.85 million , as his three daughters have moved out			2
memories : @entity10 , seen in her heyday , lived in the townhouse he says : ‘ it is an empty nest really , now that my youngest daughter has just gone to university			1
’ the property ’s unusual garden arrangement is a major feature			0
mr @entity45 says : ‘ it had its garden built over , so we ’ve got a roof terrace at a mezzanine level between the ground and the first floor , which , in many ways , is better than a garden because it ’s less gloomy			0
’ he says he can grow apples and tomatoes on this raised patio , whereas ‘ the only thing you can grow at ground level here are ferns ’			0
the first - floor sitting room has a @entity111 theme			2
‘ we ’re both very fond of @entity112 and we ’ve got quite a lot of @entity111 things , ’ mr @entity45 says			0
‘ we ’ve been to @entity112 twice in the past year			0
my wife always likes to go and bring back things			0
’ the lower ground floor of the house , which used to be servants ’ quarters , can be used as a separate flat			0
mr @entity45 says : ‘ it ’s the perfect family house because we can live quite separately and then come together			0
’ ‘ my wife can watch television in one room and i can listen to music in another			0
’ the @entity125 , like @entity10 , have become ‘ downtown ’ fans , after moving to @entity5 from @entity127 in @entity128 , and wo n’t be going far			1
mr @entity45 says : ‘ i think three bedrooms would suit us but it has to be in @entity5			2
it ca n’t be anywhere else			0
it ’s my wife ’s stipulation ; she likes the buzz			0
’ @entity137 , sales director at @entity5 , says : ‘ this traditional @entity5 townhouse will make an ideal family home or – for our international buyers – a rather opulent pied - a-terre			1
