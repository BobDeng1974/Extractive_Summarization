' it settles family arguments too			0
my wife @entity64 and i are always arguing about who we met , when we met them and how old they are			1
' she has a wonderful memory and i have a very bad memory , but i have my diaries - although i have to say she is nearly always right			0
' a lot of people are feature in the diary over the years and they often want to see what i say about them - i ’m happy to report most of it is good			2
' i ca n’t stop now , when you ’ve kept it up as long as i have you need to keep going			0
' dog lover : mr @entity12 's terriers also feature highly in the work , pictured here with one of his pets in 1988 in clover : one of the international pig consultant 's greatest achievements was when he appeared on the front cover of @entity126 in 1980 jet setter : his job was to take him all the way around the world , all of which has been painstakingly documented mr @entity12 started keeping his diary on a whim in 1947 and filled it intermittently for many years until 1975 , when he began keeping a detailed daily event log			1

mr @entity12 describes every village fete , the walks he took with his beloved @entity143 , and has amassed a vast collection of his favourite wine labels over the years			1

mr @entity12 , who has one daughter , @entity164 , has captured some of the biggest changes in history - including the switch from vinyl to @entity170			1

victory : mr @entity12 charted the street party in his village to celebrate @entity178 day , left , and right , pages showing the @entity180 of 1979 - 80 happy days : pictures of mr @entity12 when he was a boy ' in a years time they will be disappearing off the shelves and before long they will become collectors items as they clear out and the cd will take over			1
' he also documents his frustrations at the first postal strike in 17 years in 1988 and his pride at appearing on the front of ‘ @entity126 ’ magazine			0
he described the birth of @entity196 ’s first baby on august 9 , 1988 : ' @entity196 had her first baby last night , it will be fifth in succession to the throne			0

weighty tome : some of the volumes stacked on shelves that have been amassed by the 83 - year - old he added : ' in past times many diarists had the time to sketch and paint to add interest to their record			1
in 1975 i thought i can at least take photos			0
' a fortnight off is taken at @entity44 every year to update two indexes - one for the text and one for the illustrations			0
' after all , there is no point in squirreling away all that information in 22,000 pages if you ca n’t retrieve it , and i ’m pleased to say any subject or illustration can be found within three minutes			0
travel : branding and tickets from a trip he took to the continent on a @entity252 ferry pig consultant : his job was to take him all around the world and introduced him to many different cultures ' i do it because it is fun and it is also useful to show the changes in our village and over @entity62 over more than three decades , and to remind you how fickle memory can be			1
' sometimes i write just one sentence , some times i have a rush of blood to the head and i can write an essay or commentary or two or three thousand words			0
' he added : ' to begin with the diary was quite hard work and pretty boring			2
but after a few years i started being honest with myself and thought ‘ what the hell am i doing this for if i ca n’t tell the truth ? ’ ' it ’s amazing looking back how your opinions change over the years - and sometimes you do n’t like what you read from 30 years ago			1
