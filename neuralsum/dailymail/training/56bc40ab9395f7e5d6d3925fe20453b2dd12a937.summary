@entity0 was n’t sure what to expect			1
she certainly was n’t expecting to burst in to tears			1
but as she stands back and takes in this extraordinary monument to the human bonds which unite this fractious kingdom , she is overwhelmed			1
‘ i just feel that we ’re about to see our family break up and so this has made me incredibly emotional , ’ she says , before adding an impeccably @entity10 : ‘ sorry ! ’ we are standing slap bang on the @entity14 - @entity13 border at @entity15			1
before us , stands a pile of tens of thousands of rocks and stones , some painted with the @entity20 flag , some with the @entity22 , some with little messages			1
most are just plain stones from all over @entity10			1
all are a plea for unity on thursday			1
today ’s post brought a piece of the @entity49 wrapped in a @entity20 flag			1
it was sent by a man in @entity53 , accompanied by a rather touching letter saying that the collapse of that wall in 1989 had been ‘ the triumph of unity over division ’			1
in sending his bit of old @entity62 masonry , he fervently hoped that these islands would not be going in the opposite direction			2
all the stones are piled high , around a dry stone central chamber , to form a cairn - an ancient marker in the landscape - celebrating the human dimension of @entity20			1
and since the first stone was laid in july , the ‘ @entity74 ’ has grown in to a 350 - ton symbol of togetherness			1
it is now 150 feet in circumference and nine feet tall			2
it was just 18 inches high at the start			2
the organisers reckon there are now 75,000 stones in the pile			1
since the sudden surge in support for the nationalist cause , it ’s all been gathering extra momentum			2
many stones have been placed by @entity14			1
just as many – if not more – have been laid by @entity14 , @entity13 , @entity89 , @entity90 and others who have no vote in this referendum campaign because they do not have a @entity14 postcode			1
organisation : @entity96 is one of those who is helping to construct the cairn star power : @entity100 , pictured with @entity102 mp @entity101 , has visited the structure they want to do something to show they care , beyond a vacuous tweet			2
so here is one positive , demonstrative way of showing how they feel			2
to those , like @entity0 , who fear that everything they hold dear is about to implode , it is both moving and reassuring			2
the @entity13 - born daughter of a pole who fought with the @entity10 in the last war and became a @entity118 , @entity0 , 60 , is married to a @entity119 , has two @entity13 / @entity14 children and lives in @entity121			1
in other words , she is a true @entity118			2
and she had never really felt need to question her happy jumble of dynastic and geographical allegiances until this blasted referendum business came along			2
it ’s the same for @entity128 , 70			2
@entity129 - born , he is married to a @entity130 , lives in @entity14 and has family on both sides of the border			1
‘ i just felt it was right to come here , ’ he says			2
‘ but i do n’t want to make a big fuss			2
that would be very , well , @entity138			2
all day , a steady trickle of cars , buses , bikes and hikers appear in the field next to @entity15 ’s @entity145 which prides itself on being both the ‘ first ’ and ‘ last ’ house in @entity14			1
on saturday night , a thousand supporters gathered at the cairn for a free music festival			1
attraction : people have been coming from all over the @entity10 to visit the cairn near @entity15 structure : the cairn is growing ever bigger as supporters of the @entity20 add stones to the pile location : the cairn is situated exactly on the border between @entity13 and @entity14 , near the small town of @entity15 this is the ‘ heart ’ side of a debate which grows turgid and ugly whenever people get on to the ‘ head ’ side of things			1
‘ we do n’t really talk much about currency here , ’ says @entity169 , 28 , one of the energetic young team running @entity171 , the campaign behind the cairn			0
@entity176 born and bred , he is a @entity177 graduate who chucked in a @entity179 consultancy job earlier in the summer to defend the @entity20			0
if it ’s a ‘ yes ’ vote , he says he will probably emigrate			0
‘ it wo n’t be the @entity10 which i feel i belong to			1
’ another member of the team is @entity96 who has taken time off from running a @entity179 charity to help			0
the daughter of @entity188 , broadcaster and champion of all things @entity129 , she spent much of her youth near here in border country			1
‘ i just ca n’t begin to imagine waking up and finding a steel fence right there , ’ she says , gesturing at the tiny @entity194			0
‘ it ’s like tearing up a family for no reason whatsoever			0
’ like many , she has found the political aspect of the no campaign – @entity203 suits dishing out home truths to the @entity14 – badly lacking in both excitement and momentum			1
this sort of campaign , she hopes , will strike a different chord			0
it ’s all run on a shoestring			0
@entity212 is a caravan and a table in the @entity145			0
but this is the passionate , grass roots side of the @entity217 campaign			0
the team are encouraging people who can not make it up the @entity221 – or down the @entity222 - to @entity15 to send photos of themselves with stones to the @entity226 website			1
addition : a mother pushing a pram puts another stone on the ever - growing pile international : as this map shows , the stones have come from all over @entity10 and the world @entity236 graduate @entity235 , a londoner with @entity14 roots , hopes to join the @entity238 next year			1
he left a job on a @entity241 fishing boat two months back to come here and do this			0
‘ if i am in the @entity238 , i want it to be the @entity238 , ’ he says quietly			0
another carload turn up and quietly admire what is going on here			0
an @entity13 couple , who retired to their ‘ dream home ’ in @entity250 , tell me that they are so worried about impending separation that they have just put their house on the market			0
they have even talked to their bank manager about repatriating their life ’s savings to @entity13			0
they wo n’t give me their names			0
‘ there are some people who , let ’s just say , have not been very pleasant , ’ says mrs @entity263			0
quite a few of today ’s stone layers will not be named			0
it ’s a depressing but familiar symptom of the malevolence of certain elements in this campaign			0
only the other day , the cairn team arrived to find a huge ‘ yes ’ spraypainted on the stonework			0
‘ we have approached pretty much every celebrity , comedian and actor you can think of asking them to lend their support , ’ says @entity101 , @entity102 mp for @entity278 and the @entity279 and the man who dreamed up this cairn in the first place			0
‘ i ’m sad to say that the common response is “ i ’m very sympathetic but it ’s not really appropriate for me to get involved			0
’ among the handful of famous faces who have lent support is @entity100			0
after her famously combative 2009 campaign to get a better deal for @entity300 veterans , she was never likely to be deterred by the bile of a few nationalists			0
putting a stone on a pile of rocks between @entity306 and @entity121 may not save the @entity20			1
but it is often the small rituals – a yellow ribbon or a bunch of garage flowers – which can suddenly accelerate in to a movement			0
and it is , surely , more dignified than pouring a bucket of iced water over a celebrity ’s head .			0

@entity74 is made up of *100,000* stones placed by members of the public at @entity15 on the @entity14 border
supporters have been travelling from all parts of the @entity10 to add to the pile - with many overcome by emotion
