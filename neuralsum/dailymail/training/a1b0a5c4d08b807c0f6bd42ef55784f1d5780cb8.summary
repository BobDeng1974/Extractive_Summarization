a study by the @entity1 has shown that portions of food have doubled in the past 20 years @entity5 ’s supermarkets are ‘ out of control ’ when it comes to portion sizes , according to a study by the @entity1 ( @entity1 )			1
despite the deepening obesity crisis portion sizes continue to rise , and are now double the size they were in 1993			2
an average chicken curry and rice ready meal is now 53 per cent larger than in 1993 , and a shepherd ’s pie meal is about double the size			1
crumpets and garlic bread are from 20 to 30 per cent bigger now , while an average bagel has increased in size by 24 per cent			0
to gain a pound in weight , a person need only consume an additional 3,500 calories and the massive increase in portion sizes explains why so many people are unwittingly putting on excess pounds			0
as well as fuelling the growing obesity problem , the @entity1 said that oversized food portions were also contributing to heart disease , currently the @entity5 's single biggest killer			0
portion sizes of 245 products sold in @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 ’s , and @entity41 ’s were compared with portions sizes listed by the @entity43 in a 1993 in the study , the @entity35 reports			1
the @entity1 has claimed that the oversized portions are damaging the health of the nation and has urged both the @entity49 and @entity50 governments to take urgent action to curb the proportions of food sold in supermarkets			0
despite the new regulations over labelling of food which aim to make it easier for consumers to make informed choices over what they eat , the study showed that many are still confused			0
@entity39 was one of the four major supermarkets that had its portion sizes investigated in the study , along with @entity38 , @entity40 's and @entity41 bagels have increased by 24 per cent in the last 20 years , while a curry ready meal is 53 per cent bigger the rules stipulate that nutritional information must be clearly displayed on the front of packaging , using a ‘ traffic light ’ colour code and showing the salt , fat , sugar and caloric content of 100g of the product			1
the @entity1 surveyed 140 people and many reported still being unsure about the content and correct portion sizes of their food			1
@entity83 , chief executive of the @entity1 says of the findings : ‘ we urgently need a government review of portion sizes in the @entity5 , ’ ‘ we are calling on supermarkets and manufacturers to take their share of responsibility for how much we eat			2
