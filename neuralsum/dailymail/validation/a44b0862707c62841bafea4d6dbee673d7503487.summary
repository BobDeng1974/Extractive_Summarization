a high - flying academic who travels the world as a @entity3 adviser is set to be deported from @entity4 under ' barmy ' new visa laws - because she is out of the country more than 180 days a year			1
dr @entity7 , 38 , is originally from @entity8 but has been living in the @entity4 since becoming a lecturer at the @entity10 seven years ago			1
the world - renowned academic 's work - which helps the @entity4 government to set foreign policy - requires her to spend long spells working in @entity17 and @entity18			1
set to be deported : @entity7 with her husband , @entity20 , 61 , and one - year - old son @entity21 , must leave @entity4 under ' barmy ' new visa laws in 2009 and 2010 she spent around 200 days abroad researching @entity17 's foreign peacekeeping and humanitarian operations			1
but @entity25 immigration laws now state that people working in the @entity4 on a migrant visa can not be out of the country for more than 180 days each year			1
and despite the fact dr @entity7 does research for a government - funded organisation and her baby son was born in @entity4 , the @entity25 has decided to deport her			1
her university colleagues have slammed the decision as ' vindictive and bone - headed ' but the @entity25 has refused to back down			0
today , dr @entity7 , who lives in @entity37 , @entity38 , with her husband @entity20 , 61 , and their one - year - old son @entity21 , said : ' it came as a massive , utter shock			1
' my @entity44 husband quit his job to join me in the @entity4 as a family			0
i bought a house in @entity37 two years ago and gave birth to my son here			0
' i have my life here , everything is here but i have to give up everything			0
battle : dr @entity7 's university colleagues have slammed the decision as ' vindictive and bone - headed ' ' it is idiocy			1
the government funded my research and now they are penalising me for hard work and contributing to their policies			2
' i have one published paper which is uploaded on the @entity4 embassy in @entity67 's website			0
they changed the visa rule in 2012 and have applied it retrospectively to my travel in 2009 and 2010			1
' what has happened to me is absolutely wrong and everyone understands my point except the @entity25			0
' i thought this was a democratic country with natural justice but it does n't seem that way			0
' dr @entity7 , an expert in international relations , has decided not to appeal the decision because the cost of the process would make it ' impractical '			1
instead she has taken a job at a university in @entity86 , @entity8 , and the family are leaving the @entity4 on march 29			2
her husband @entity88 said the @entity25 decision has caused the family to uproot their whole life			0
left with no choice : dr @entity7 , an expert in international relations , has decided not to appeal the decision because the cost of the process would make it ' impractical ' he added : ' it tears at your heart because we 've gone to great lengths to make good friends in the neighbourhood and we 're very supportive and contribute to the community			2
' we 're having to tear our son out of nursery , give up a home we 've established , with neighbours we 're very fond of , and none of that is our doing			0
' it 's an inflexibility - the law does not have the capacity to deal with individual situations			2
it 's our whole life			0
' dr @entity7 came to the @entity10 in 2008 on a prestigious five - year @entity117 @entity4 fellowship , which then became a permanent role			1
but when applying to extend her visa last march , she was banned and told she would be deported because of the foreign travel aspect of her job			0
university bosses even wrote to the @entity25 to tell officials that the trips were part of her job			0
in december , dr @entity7 won an appeal against the @entity25 with a judge suggesting it would not be in the national interest to deport someone who had ' made a significant and profound contribution to the academic framework of higher education in this country '			1
but that ruling was later overturned and immigration bosses confiscated the family 's passports a year ago			0
professor @entity139 said dr @entity7 's research had had a significant impact on policy towards @entity17 , including on the @entity4 's co-operation programme with the country			1
unsympathetic : government officials told her she could keep in touch with friends in the @entity4 via skype after ruling her private life should be given ' little weight ' @entity151 , professor of parliamentary government at the university , said : ' it is pure madness for the government to be driving out an expert on what is probably the most important foreign policy challenge of the next decade			2
' both from a human perspective and from the interests of the @entity4 , this is indefensible			0
' dr @entity7 's local mp , @entity163 , even wrote to home secretary @entity164 asking her to consider the decision , but no action was taken			2
a @entity25 spokesperson said : ' ms @entity7 's application for indefinite leave to remain was refused in july 2014 because she had spent more than 180 days outside the @entity4			1
' government officials told her she could keep in touch with friends in the @entity4 via skype after ruling her private life should be given ' little weight '			0
dr @entity7 said she believes her case will have a wider impact on the @entity4 's ability to hire foreign professionals			1
she added : ' this could mean the @entity4 loses its capacity to hire any foreign professional on a permanent basis			0
' who would want to stop their live elsewhere and move everything to the @entity4 only to be kicked out after five years			2

dr @entity7 has been a lecturer at @entity10 for 7 years
she is originally from @entity8 and her research is famous around the world
in 2010 she spent around 200 days abroad on a humanitarian operation
law made in 2012 denies migrant visas to those out @entity4 for over 180 days
rule to be applied retrospectively so it takes her previous trip into *account*
despite working for a government - funded group , she must leave @entity4
she believes inflexibility will stop top professionals wanting to work in @entity4
