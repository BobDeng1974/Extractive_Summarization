@entity0 gave us a shock earlier this month during a harrowing event , dubbed the @entity4			1
during the scene , a major character was killed by drinking from a poisoned chalice			1
as the trial for the suspected killer begins , the @entity8 has created a video explaining the science behind the poisoning and what plant may have been used in the plot			1
warning : spoilers appear below a chemical expert from @entity18 has created a video explaining the science behind the poisoning			1
by looking at the symptoms and cause of death , dr @entity21 selects three possible naturally - occurring suspects - @entity25 , @entity26 and the @entity27 , pictured the poison was said to have come from a plant , which dr @entity21 narrows down to three dangerous plants , namely @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity31			1
all three plants produce alkaloids , which have at least one , potentially fatal , nitrogen atom in the heterocyclic ring			2
dangerous alkaloids include atropine , coniine and strychnine			2
in the show , @entity42 poison caused the muscles in the victim ’s neck to clench together restricting the flow of air to the body			1
deadly @entity51 , also known as @entity52 , and @entity26 affect muscles , however they cause these muscles to relax , not tighten			2
@entity56 , on the other hand , not only causes the muscles to convulse , these symptoms start in the face and neck - which fits with the show			0
during the episode , much - hated @entity62 dies during his wedding to @entity65 after drinking wine from the poisoned cup			1
the poison is dubbed @entity42 because it causes @entity62 to choke and grab at his throat			1
chemist dr @entity21 from @entity70 in @entity18 has investigated what this poison could have been and why it caused the physical reactions in the tv show			1
she narrows it down to three potentially poisonous plants - namely @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity31			0
‘ all three of these plants share something in common , ’ dr @entity21 explained			0
‘ they all make alkaloids			0
’ in general terms , alkaloids are naturally - occurring compounds that have at least one nitrogen atom in the heterocyclic ring			0
dangerous alkaloids include atropine , coniine and strychnine			0
in the tv show , and @entity93 ’s books , @entity42 poison causes the muscles in the victim ’s neck to clench together restricting the flow of air to the body			1
all three plants produce alkaloids , which have at least one , potentially fatal , nitrogen atom in the heterocyclic ring			0
dangerous alkaloids include atropine , coniine and strychnine , pictured			0
in the show , @entity42 poison caused the muscles in the victim 's neck to clench together and choke them according to dr @entity21 , this means the poison ca n’t be the first two suspects - @entity25 , also known as @entity52 , and @entity26 - because although they affect the muscles , they cause these muscles to relax , not tighten			1
‘ around 10 to 20 minutes after you inject a lethal dose of strychnine , your going to start feeling your muscles convulse , in the face and neck first , ’ dr @entity21 said			0
‘ this kind of fits in with how [ @entity0 author ] @entity93 describes @entity42			1
’ according to dr @entity21 , the poison could n't be the first two suspects - @entity25 , also known as @entity52 , and @entity26 - because although they affect muscles , they cause these muscles to relax , not tighten			2
this leaves strychnine which causes muscles to convulse in the face and neck in the books , the strangler is made using the leaves of a plant ‘ from the sea of @entity139 half the world away ’ and is extracted with a ‘ wash of lime and sugar			0
’ it ’s true styrchnine can be found in the leaves of a plant , but it ca n’t be extracted using limes			2
however , alkaloids can be extracted using a process involving calcium oxide , which is a limestone product			0
dr @entity21 continued that sugar may have been used to disguise the bitter taste of the strychnine plant and concluded is likely the evil fictional king was murdered by this chemical			0
‘ sometimes science gets a bad rap			2
people think it 's dry or super serious , ' @entity21 said			0
‘ pop culture is really a good medium to talk about science in a way that anyone and everyone can participate			2

a major @entity0 character was *recently* poisoned and killed
the poison caused the character ’s throat to close , choking them
a chemist has created a video explaining the science behind the poisoning
she concludes the death was caused by poison taken the @entity27
