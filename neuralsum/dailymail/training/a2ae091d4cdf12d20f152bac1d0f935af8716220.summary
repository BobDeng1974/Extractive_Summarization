the clip also prompted the @entity80 's director - general @entity79 to warn the monks not to repeat the lavish behaviour , and there are plans for the watchdog to begin monitoring monks across @entity27			1
@entity41 is also the focus of a money - laundering investigation , with a police colonel , @entity90 - in @entity91 claiming that the abbot , along with others , had 41 bank accounts filled with cash from public donations to his monestry , with the accounts mostly in his name			2

@entity147 , an administrative officer at @entity148 in @entity150 province , confirmed that the monks on the private plane lived at the temple but refused to give details about the trip			0
the images from the video contrasted with the abbot 's message on the temple 's homepage that read : ' the true core of those who preach @entity112 's teachings is to not to own any objects at all '			2
mr @entity79 said : ' when lord @entity112 was alive , there was n't anything like this			0
there were no cars , smart phones or cameras , so the rules were much simpler			0
' while the monks need to keep themselves abreast of new knowledge , current events and technology , they are restrained to choose the appropriate tools			0
' he said one way to prevent the monks from misbehaving is for followers not to spoil them with valuable objects or vices			0
' in many cases , it was the followers who gave the monks the luxury			0
some bought them sports cars			0
this is by no means necessary			0
