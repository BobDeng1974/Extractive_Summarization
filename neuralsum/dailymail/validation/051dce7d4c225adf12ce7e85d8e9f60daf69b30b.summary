it rather summed up a week when he made headlines for all the wrong reasons that @entity4 should find the water twice on the 18th hole at the @entity7 at @entity8 on sunday			1
on @entity11 television over the weekend it was impossible to escape footage of him tossing his three iron into the water on friday			2
before the start of play , @entity18 , preposterous owner of this overrated venue , had presented @entity4 with the said club , after it was retrieved by a scuba diver			1
how typical of @entity18 that he plans to have the club mounted in the hotel , thereby glorifying an action that would have every regular golfer drummed out of their club if they tried it			0
@entity4 hits a shot from the ninth fairway during the final roudn att the @entity7 @entity4 's round was shaping up nicely before his unfortunate finish on the 18th hole the @entity36 tries to play his way out of trouble during a disappointing final round at @entity8 @entity4 himself is keen to put the incident behind him and did his best with a round that was shaping up nicely until an unfortunate finish			1
he stood on the 18th tee tied for sixth but put his drive into the water on this brutal hole and then , after adding a penalty shot , his third shot as well			1
at least he did n’t lose his sense of humour			0
he feigned to throw another club in the drink , but this time held on to it			0
through the back of the green in five , @entity4 was facing a difficult chip down the slope and staring down the barrel of an ugly triple or worse			1
he chipped it in to the end the tournament with a more characteristic demonstration of his usual swagger			0
the resultant double bogey meant he signed for a 71			1
he still finished in the top 10 , though			0
all those missed putts , shots and water adventures therefore , and still only a handful of players beat him			2
among the leaders , it was hard not to feel sorry for @entity11 @entity77			1
he began with a five - stroke lead but got his choke in early			1
@entity80 plays a shot out of a bunker on the 11th hole at @entity84 there was a seven - shot swing in the first seven holes between him and @entity80 , leaving the @entity88 champion with a two - shot advantage			1
@entity80 , however , then dropped a couple of shots himself			0
with eight holes to play there was a three - way tie for the lead involving these two and fellow big hitter @entity97			1
one of the best rounds came from @entity100 ’s @entity99 , who shot 68			1
the 27 - year - old , early leader of the race to @entity104 , is getting more comfortable at this rarefied level , and this was a fine confidence boost ahead of his first appearance at @entity88 next month			2
the resultant top - 15 finish boosted his world ranking and , as a member of the top 50 , assured him of a first appearance in a regular @entity114 event at the @entity115 in 10 days			1
he will also play the @entity116 before @entity117			0
@entity97 winds up a shot on the 10th hole during a strong final round for the @entity11 ‘ i ’m obviously very pleased , ’ he said			2
‘ it ’s a tough course and the set - up is very difficult so to finish on level par for the week , i ’d have bitten your hand off if you ’d offered me that on thursday			2
when you ’re playing with the top 50 you know they ’re not going to give you anything , but i ’m feeling more comfortable all the time			0
’ how far can he go ? one area of concern remains a chronic back injury that has caused him to withdraw from plenty of tournaments over the years and one this year already			0
‘ i ’m taking painkillers and managing it , ’ he said			0
‘ i ’m going to stay over here through the masters because flying back and forth is no good for it			0
there ’s no point worrying about it , i ’ve just got to get on with it			2
’ he is doing that all right .			0
