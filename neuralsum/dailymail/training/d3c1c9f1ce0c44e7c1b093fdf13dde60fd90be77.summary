the moment @entity0 parts the @entity3 is one the most famous @entity5 miracles			2
but instead of relying on @entity6 to divide the water into two huge columns , as seen in the 1956 film , ' @entity10 , ’ @entity0 may have instead used his knowledge of tides to guide the @entity13 to safety and escape the @entity16 ’s army			1
this is the claim made by dr @entity18 , an author , visiting professor at the @entity19 , @entity20 , and former chief scientist of the of @entity22 ( @entity22 ’s ) @entity23			1
a screenshot of the moment from @entity30 's new film , ‘ @entity31 , ’ is pictured in the @entity5 story , @entity0 parts the sea , allowing the children of @entity36 to cross a dry seabed to the opposite shore , while the waters ‘ close ’ and drown the @entity16 ’s soldiers , who are in pursuit			1
the tale will feature in @entity30 ’s ‘ @entity31 , ’ who claims that his version will be more ‘ realistic , ’ with the parting explained by a tsunami caused by an earthquake			2
this is because , before a tsunami strikes , coastal waters often recede			0
however , dr @entity18 writes in @entity52 that the explanation is flawed , because waters typically only drawback for up to 20 minutes , which could not have given the @entity13 enough time to cross the dry seabed , thought to be at the @entity57 , at the northern end of the @entity3			1
moses would not have been able to predict an earthquake and tsunami , unless he was tipped off by @entity6 , he added			0
instead , the expert believes that @entity0 used his local knowledge of tides to ensure his people got safe passage			0
in the @entity57 ( stock image ) , the low tides mean that parts of the seabed can be dry for hours , before the waters make a sudden return			0
according to the @entity5 , the children of @entity36 were camped on the western shore of the @entity57 when @entity16 ’s troops were spotted in the distance accounts from the @entity5 suggest that @entity6 gave @entity0 the power to part the waters in the form of a miracle			2
it has been suggested that the water parted because of a tsunami caused by an earthquake			0
this is because , before a tsunami strikes , coastal waters often recede			0
@entity87 , @entity30 , chose this explanation to depict in his new film , ' @entity90 : @entity91 and @entity92 '			2
dr @entity18 believes that @entity0 used his knowledge of the tides to enable his people to cross shallow waters at low tide			1
his perfect timing meant that as the last of the @entity13 crossed to safety , pursuing @entity101 soldiers were drowned as the waters suddenly returned			1
in the @entity57 , the low tides mean that parts of the seabed can be dry for hours , before the waters make a sudden return			0
according to the @entity5 , the children of @entity36 were camped on the western shore of the @entity57 when the @entity16 's troops were spotted in the distance			0
dust clouds raised by chariots and horses of the approaching army would have allowed @entity0 to calculate their time of arrival , dr @entity18 said			2
having lived in the wilderness , @entity0 would have known useful low tide @entity3 crossings and by looking at the moon , he could have predicted when low tide would occur			1
this knowledge would not have been used by the soldiers who lived along the @entity125 , which is connected to the @entity126 and does not have dramatic tides			0
dr @entity18 writes : ‘ knowing when low tide would occur , how long the sea bottom would remain dry and when the waters would rush back in , @entity0 could plan the @entity13 ’ escape			1
’ the @entity5 tale cites a full moon on the night of the dramatic escape , which would have meant that the low tide would be at its lowest , allowing the seabed to have stayed drier for longer , giving the people longer to cross			2
if this was the case , the high tide would also have been higher and more likely to drown an army , as described in the @entity5 story			0
this is the parting of the @entity3 as depicted in the @entity143 blockbuster , ' @entity10 '			0
because water levels were higher in the @entity3 in @entity5 times , the expert estimates that ‘ walls ’ of water may well have come crashing down on the @entity101 soldiers , but they would n't have parted in this way in order for this to happen , @entity0 ’ timing would have had to be perfect , so that the last of the @entity13 crossed the dry sea just before the return of the high tide – enticing the @entity16 's army to follow them and letting the powerful returning waters catch them unawares			1
dr @entity18 says @entity0 may have managed this either by using some sort of delaying tactic , or by sending his most able - bodied people back to entice the soldiers to chase them across the seabed			1
the @entity5 story also mentions a strong east wind that helped to ‘ push back ’ the waters			0
dr @entity18 said that it is true that wind blowing across a shallow waterway pushes it back , so such a wind may have heightened the effect of low tide to reveal more dry seabed than normal			1
of course , such a wind could be attributed to divine intervention , but dr @entity18 believes that @entity0 ’ timing ‘ had to be based on a tide prediction ’			1
because water levels were higher in the @entity3 in @entity5 times , the expert estimates that ‘ walls ’ of water may well have come crashing down on the @entity101 soldiers			0
dr @entity18 is not the first scientist to suggest this theory to explain the @entity3 miracle			1
an account written by an ancient historian called @entity185 between 80 and 40 @entity186 , says : ‘ @entity0 , being acquainted with the country , waited for the ebb and took the people across the sea when dry			0

dr @entity18 , former chief scientist of the @entity22 ’s @entity23 believes @entity0 understood the moon and tides
knowledge helped him predict when the @entity13 could cross the @entity3 during low tide , when the sea bed was dry
perfect timing meant waters rushed back when the soldiers were crossing
a rival explanation of the ' miracle ' which will appear in the film , ' @entity90 : gods and @entity92 ' is that a tsunami caused the sea to part
