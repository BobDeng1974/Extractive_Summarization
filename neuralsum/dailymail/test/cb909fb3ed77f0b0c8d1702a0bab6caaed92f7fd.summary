between the sugar - free devotees and the paleo health nuts sprouting advice in forums and on blogs , there are a lot of confusing messages surrounding what foods are best and most for nourishing children			1
in an exclusive interview with @entity13 , @entity15 children 's cookbook guru @entity11 has slammed @entity17 ' controversial bone broth recipe in his book ' @entity20 - @entity19 ' , calling it dangerous , and said the paleo method goes against everything nutritionists and child health experts recommend			1
' babies need milk - it needs to be a formula or breast milk because it has the nutrients they need and bone broth will not give them what breast milk or formula does , ' @entity11 , 51 , said			1
' who is going to be making bone broth ? ' i mean , it ’s a lot of work and it ’s also very low calorie amount of food , ' she said			2
' the baby wo n't have any nutrition they need - it ’s entirely dangerous and i would definitely not advise that			0
' ' children ’s diets are slightly different to adult diets			2
when they ’re young , the whole low - fat high fibre does n't apply to children , they need high fats and not many high fibre foods because they deplete the body of nutrients when they ’re young , ' she added			0
bad for bubba : @entity11 says @entity75 's kids cook book goes against everything health experts would advise ' however , from two years old , provided they ’re not underweight , they can have low - fat skim milk , but up until two they should have full fat milk , proper yoghurt and full fat everything			1
' yet a lot of people give them fruit and vegetables for far too long and they do n’t have the nutrients they need to grow so children as a result become deficient in vitamins and minerals			0
' ' so it 's really important babies have iron rich food , essential fatty acids and nutrient dense foods - which is basically the opposite of bone broth			1
' they need cheese because their tummies are so small and they need energy because they ’re running around , so cheese , avocado and meat have a high calorie content and that ’s really important , ' said @entity11			1
fad foods : @entity11 says she does n't believe in fads and is against sugar free , paleo and low carb diets ' so basically ( the paleo diet ) goes against everything that nutritionists and experts in child health would advise and i do n’t know where he gets his advice from but i would not advise it			1
' at the mention of certain grains and carbohydrates being excluded , @entity11 gasped			2
' sandwiches , breakfast cereals , pasta , all of those - are you saying you can not have any of that ? they 're staples for children			0
if you ca n’t get them to eat something you can at least get them to eat spaghetti bolegnese			0
' and in their lunch box they ’d usually have a wrap or a sandwich , so what are they going to have ? bone broth ? ! ' @entity11 is also an advocate of good sugars despite popular beliefs currently surrounding the move towards complete sugar bans			2
‘ i ’m not into fads , i prefer an all - round good diet but i ’m not a purist either			0
if a child has an icecream or a chocolate it ’s okay as well as long as it ’s a part of a good diet			0
that 's life - if you ban foods , they become forbidden treats and children will want them all the more , ' she says			2
' these exclusion diets do n't make sense to me , you need protein , carbohydrates , you need fat , you need essential fatty acids and you need a balance of all these things			0
' @entity11 crusade : @entity11 is out to revolutionise healthy meals for kids with the launch of a new frozen food range ' there ’s sugar and then there is sugar			1
fruit sugars are okay , and having an orange juice or a smoothie is okay			0
while it 's not as good as eating the whole fruit ( where you get the fibre ) they still have a lot of nutrients in them			0
' ' it ’s almost like juices and smoothies are now being promoted as not good for you – which is just not true , ' she says			0
' yet , i would have chocolate cake or a bag of crisps in the fridge but my children did n't usually want to eat it because the food i made was healthy tasted delicious it was often better than the unhealthy food			2
' obesity epidemic : @entity11 says aside from diabetes and tooth decay , obese children are also not happy instead , @entity11 believes balance is key			1
mothers are working longer hours than ever before and she believes while they all start with good intentions and want to feed their children well , children get hungry , wo n't wait and so mothers are worn down into giving unhealthy , time - poor food substitutes like chocolate , chicken nuggets , pizza etc. as a mother of three herself , @entity11 knows exactly the pressures facing new mums			1
beginning her career after the tragic death of her first born @entity229 , @entity11 became extremely passionate about making recipes that would nourish her children that followed , as well as helping other mother 's give their children food they would eat			1
mum to the rescue : @entity11 aims to revolutionise meal time for mums with 33 freezer friendly meals in range it was while she worked at a playgroup that her success in fact began			1
sharing recipes with other mums , they praised her meals and suggested she write a cook book			1
and the rest is history			0
her cook book , ' the @entity252 ' ( in which she worked closely with the @entity253 ) was born			1
and despite initially being rejected by 20 publishers , it went on to sell four million copies back in 1991 , making her a guru of children 's cookery			1
rags to riches : @entity11 's first cook book ' @entity252 and @entity262 ' was refused by 20 publishers before getting picked up now in a bid to help the seven million obese people currently across the nation , @entity11 has arrived in @entity266 to promote her new healthy food range for children in the hopes to be a trail blazer , revolutionise the healthy meal scene for children and help mother 's for generations to come			1
@entity275 - ' i add five hidden vegetables - onion , leek , tomato , carrot and capsicum			0
' @entity289 and apple balls - ' with minced chicken , thyme , breadcrumbs , apple , chicken stock mixed and made into little balls			0
fish goujons - ' fish coated in crushed rice crispies and parmesan			0
it 's different but really yummy and children lick them up with their fingers			2
' the freezer friendly meal range is made in @entity266 with locally sourced ingredients , has over 33 meal options and includes a variety of flavours from butter chicken to oriental food and a five veg spaghetti bolognese			1
' somebody has to do something , children are getting mature onset diabetes and they ’re loosing their teeth with all the huge amounts of sugar , ' she says			0
' @entity317 fat children are not happy children , they are not good at sports , they are laughed at , they have complexes and you know you want them to grow up to be healthy and happy			0
' she also adds , while mums want the best for their children , it is difficult feeding children and they need help because currently whenever they buy something unhealthy food is pushed at them			2
' the only challenge now will be to get mums to go to the frozen food aisle and buy these foods because its not where they expect to find them			0
