@entity0 , 28 , mother to three - year - old @entity1 and her unborn baby died after she walked in front of a train at @entity5 , @entity6 a pregnant woman killed herself by walking into the path of a train after a doctor failed to warn her about the side - effects of an anti-anxiety drug , an inquest heard			1
@entity0 , 28 , and her unborn baby died after she walked into the path of a speeding train at @entity5 station , @entity6 , on march 16 last year			1
an inquest at @entity18 in @entity19 heard how married mrs @entity0 , who already had a three - year - old daughter called @entity1 , had suffered with anxiety since the age of 17			1
coroner @entity23 said opportunities to help her were missed in the run - up to her death			2
the inquest heard how minutes before her death , mrs @entity0 sent a text message to her husband @entity28 which said : ' i love you and @entity1 with all my heart , it 's not your fault i 'm like this , i ca n't cope anymore , i 'm sorry			1
' the hearing was told that the teaching assistant had a long - term prescription for anti-anxiety drug @entity39 to help manage her symptoms but stopped taking the drug on doctors ' advice when she fell pregnant with her second child			1
however , she was prescribed @entity46 after complaining of constant morning sickness and was put back on a low - dosage of @entity39 in february last year after telling her gp , dr @entity50 , that she was ' unable to cope '			1
the inquest heard that dr @entity50 failed to warn her of the possible side - effects of the anti-depressant			1
during the hearing , @entity56 family counsel @entity55 grilled dr @entity58 about the decision to prescribe @entity39 again			0
she asked him : ' is n't it the case that in the early stages of taking @entity39 it can cause an increased risk of self - harm or suicidal thoughts ? ' that is an established side - effect of the medication in some cases			2
' it was irrelevant that she had taken it over the years			0
each period of taking it is different			0
' dr @entity50 said he did not consider there to be a risk due to the reduced amount prescribed , as well as mrs @entity0 ' previous experience taking the medication , but admitted he did not warn her of the increased risk			1
the inquest also heard how on the day of her death mrs @entity0 phoned a mental health crisis team twice and informed them that she was having thoughts about jumping in front of a train			1
a nurse arranged a visit to her house later that day but when she arrived four hours later mrs @entity0 had already died			2
the coroner returned a verdict of suicide but said opportunities to help mrs @entity0 had been missed by medical professionals			1
she said : ' opportunities have been missed in respect of the initial referral to the hospital from the @entity100 ' practice and the lack of adequate recording in the @entity100 ' notes meant the evidence was insufficient to ascertain whether she stopped taking the drugs of her own accord or because she was advised to do so			0
' there is also insufficient evidence to show whether restarting the @entity39 contributed to her death , or whether the @entity46 was prescribed for sickness or anxiety			0
' however these were clinical decisions made by medical professionals and outside the remit of this inquest			0
' the @entity56 family 's solicitors , @entity117 and @entity118 , said an investigation into her death by the @entity121 's mental health service had highlighted ' various areas of her care that were of concern '			0
it said mrs @entity0 was left to seek help herself instead of being referred to experts by professionals			2
a similar probe by @entity129 found care may not have been provided to a standard which may have averted her death			0
solicitor @entity132 , who represented mr @entity56 at the inquest , said : ' it is of great concern to @entity0 's family both investigating trusts are critical of the care she received on a number of different levels			0
' mrs @entity0 , who suffered with severe anxiety from the age of 17 , died after walking into the path of a speeding train at @entity5 station , @entity6 ( pictured ) , on march 16 last year			1
a coroner recorded a verdict of suicide the law firm added : ' based on the evidence presented at the inquest the family will be pursuing a claim			0
' the inquest also heard how mrs @entity0 ' gp surgery , @entity154 in @entity155 , had since changed its procedures to ensure that all expectant mothers are reviewed for mental health problems			2
the surgery is also in the process of making improvements to the way it shares information with other health services , the hearing was told			0
@entity129 has also installed a new computer system which lets gps access patient records in a bid to reduce communication problems .			0
