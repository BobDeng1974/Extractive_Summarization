by @entity0 published : 01:23 est , 6 august 2012 updated : 08:45 est , 7 august 2012 doused in a searing chemical ; disabled and scarred for life ; struck by a depression which can make it hard to go on - the plight of @entity8 's acid attack victims is truly heartbreaking			1
and the number of these horrific assaults is on the rise			2
at least 250 @entity8 women have been disfigured in the last three years , with this year ’s victim reports already outpacing 2011 ’s			1
the figures have drawn comparison with countries like @entity17 or @entity18 , countries more notorious for these attacks - as many as 150 @entity17 women are attacked every day , according to the @entity22			1
victim : @entity8 acid victim @entity24 poses with a photo of herself prior to an attack in 2004 that left her disfigured yet in @entity8 , whose population is nearly four times smaller than @entity17 ’s , the attacks are believed more prominent and experts believe there are far more victims out there than reported			1
' we know of many cases that were never reported because of threats , because of fear , ' 28 - year - old acid victim @entity36 told the @entity22			1
ms @entity36 was attacked five years ago , leaving burn marks down her face , chest and hands , while also taking away the eyesight in her left eye			2
she believes it was her former husband who carried out the attack after she refused to get back together with him			2
he did n't throw the acid himself , she said , but hired the attackers			1
' the aim is to harm , not to kill			2
and to harm somebody for the rest of her life , ' she said			0
like ms @entity36 , many are believed victimized by former lovers or some , like former beauty pageant contestant @entity56 , who was 22 - years - old at the time of her attack , for their looks			2
beauty queen : former miss @entity8 contestant @entity56 was doused with acid in 2010 after leaving a pageant 's rehearsal with her parents , she 's seen before her attack the former @entity67 contestant was brutally attacked near her home following a pageant ’s rehearsal with her parents in 2010			1
despite authorities in the @entity8 city of @entity74 claiming to know who ordered the attack , they said they could not perform an arrest because of a law that required miss @entity56 to spend a minimum of 30 days in recovery			1
miss @entity56 received burns to her face , eye , and parts of her chest and lower body , but had only 20 days in recovery with a doctor			2
while an arrest has still not been made in her attack , according to @entity90 , last may outrage over the episode help lead to an increase in the maximum prison sentence available to attackers			1
the country 's previous sentence to attackers was six months to two years in prison			1
commonality : @entity100 , 20 , suffered an acid attack by a boyfriend 4 years ago in @entity103 , the same city where many others have become victim , and for similar reasons under the penmanship of representative @entity109 , it has been emended to a maximum of 20 years with the attackers also required to provide the victims with protection and comprehensive care			1
for 51 - year - old @entity115 who was attacked by her boyfriend 11 years ago - requiring her to wear a mask to prevent infection and a tube to breathe out of her nose - that care would be far from all she has now			1
today she walks a market in @entity103 begging for change after , like many acid victims , being unable to find work for herself due to her appearance			1
' i 've thought about committing suicide , yes sir , i 've thought about taking my life three times			0
i say to myself , why live ? with a life like the one i have , what for ? ' she told @entity137			0
' i had perfect teeth			0
i was very pretty ... but now , i 'm destroyed			0
' lasting effects : @entity115 , 51 , begs for change in a market in @entity103 after brutally attacked by a boyfriend 11 years ago , leaving her unable to get a job due to her appearance like ms @entity115 , 26 - year - old @entity145 too says ca n't find work in @entity103 and has contemplated suicide after doused with the chemical by whom she says was her ex-boyfriend			2
wearing a mask over her mouth , a patch over her eye and a breathing tube in her nose to prevent it from conveying , she recently told a @entity158 reporter : ' who ’s going to give me a job looking like this ? ' but she has a little boy to take care of			0
- acid victim @entity145 she recalls the first time she revealed her face to her six - year - old whose father she says was her attacker			1
he said : ' " @entity170 , let ’s kill this person who did this to you			0
" ' he said , " when i ’m older and have a job , i ’ll buy you special cream to heal your face			0
" they 're emotional memories that send her into near tears			0
she said her son still does n't know all of what happened , but with a psychologist 's recommendation , he knows parts			2
in her retelling of the attack she described it as a mistake : his father mistaking hot water across her face for cold			0
' the doctors told me to forget about the face i once had , ' miss @entity145 said			0
' those words almost killed me			0
i thought about jumping off the 7th floor of the hospital			0
' ' i ’m alive because of my son , ' she said			0
' i could n’t bear to leave him alone			0
