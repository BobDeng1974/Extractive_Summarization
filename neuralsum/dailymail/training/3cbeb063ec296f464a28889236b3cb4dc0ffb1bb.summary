by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 05:24 est , 16 october 2013 updated : 05:47 est , 16 october 2013 @entity2 today hailed a ‘ great victory for common sense ’ as two convicted murderers lost a @entity5 battle for the right to vote while in jail			1
the @entity11 's highest court dismissed appeals brought by @entity13 and @entity14			1
judges said the public is opposed to giving inmates the vote and it was ‘ not surprising ’ mps had moved to block the idea			1
defeat : murderers @entity14 ( left ) and @entity13 lost their @entity5 bid to demand they be given the right to vote behind bars the latest round of the legal battle against the ban preventing them from voting while in prison was rejected by seven @entity5 justices in @entity32			1
@entity13 , who is in his 50s , is serving life for raping and strangling his seven - year - old niece @entity35 in @entity36 in 1977			1
@entity14 , from @entity37 , is serving his life sentence at @entity40 prison for the 1998 murder of @entity42 in @entity43			1
mr @entity2 , who once said the idea of giving prisoners the vote makes him ‘ sick ’ , wrote on @entity47 this morning : ‘ the @entity5 judgment on prisoner voting is a great victory for common sense			1
’ in the unanimous ruling , @entity52 , deputy president of the @entity5 , said : ‘ prisoners ' voting is an emotive subject			1
' some people feel very strongly that prisoners should not be allowed to vote			2
and public opinion polls indicate that most people share that view			0
’ there is still a ‘ substantial majority against it ’ , she said , adding : ‘ it is not surprising therefore that in february 2011 elected @entity67 also voted overwhelmingly against any relaxation of the present law			0
’ backing : @entity2 expressed his delight at the ruling , having previously said the idea of giving prisoners the vote makes him ' sick ' @entity52 said : ‘ in such circumstances , it is incumbent upon the courts to tread delicately			1
‘ of course , in any modern democracy , the views of the public and @entity67 can not be the end of the story			0
‘ democracy is about more than respecting the views of the majority			0
it is also about safeguarding the rights of minorities , including unpopular minorities			0
’ the @entity90 ruled in 2005 that a blanket ban on serving prisoners going to the polls was incompatible with the @entity94 ( @entity90 ) , relating to the right to free and fair elections			0
the @entity98 court said it was up to individual countries to decide which inmates should be denied the right to vote from jail , but that a total ban was illegal			0
ruling : @entity52 , one of the @entity5 judges , said it was not surprising that mps had voted against the idea @entity13 , who is also known as @entity107 , originally had his voting claims rejected by the @entity109 in 2009			1
his challenge at the @entity5 followed a decision by three @entity113 judges in december 2010 when it was argued on his behalf that the serious nature of his offence did not justify disenfranchising him , and to do so was ‘ disproportionate ’ and violated his human rights			2
another @entity5 judge @entity118 said today : ‘ in any democracy , the franchise will be determined by domestic laws which will define those entitled to vote in more or less inclusive terms			1
’ ‘ the exclusion of convicted prisoners from the franchise is not a universal principle among mature democracies , but neither is it uncommon			0
’ @entity118 added : ‘ from a prisoner 's point of view the loss of the right to vote is likely to be a very minor deprivation by comparison with the loss of liberty			0
’ @entity138 is detained at @entity139 in @entity140 and the minimum term he was ordered to serve before becoming eligible to apply for parole has expired			0
@entity14 received a minimum term of 13 years , but due to subsequent convictions , including taking two prison nurses hostage in a siege in 2001 , will not be considered for parole until 2015			2
under section three of the @entity149 , convicted prisoners are prevented from voting in parliamentary and local government elections - and under the @entity154 2002 a person is only entitled to vote in @entity98 parliamentary elections if he is entitled to vote in parliamentary elections			1
in november the government published the @entity158 ( prisoners ) @entity160 for pre-legislative scrutiny by a joint committee of both houses			0
it has put forward three options - a ban for prisoners sentenced to four years or more , a ban for prisoners sentenced to more than six months and a re-statement of the existing ban			0
@entity172 , @entity173 ’s shadow justice secretary , said : ' @entity173 ’s policy is , and always has been , that prisoners should n’t be given the vote			2
' we believe that committing a crime so serious that a judge has deprived you of your liberty means you should also lose the ability to vote in elections			2
that 's why we are pleased with today 's @entity5 judgement			2

murderers @entity13 and @entity14 lose latest legal battle
@entity5 rules unanimously against appeal to vote behind bars
prime minister once said the idea of prisoners voting makes him ' sick '
