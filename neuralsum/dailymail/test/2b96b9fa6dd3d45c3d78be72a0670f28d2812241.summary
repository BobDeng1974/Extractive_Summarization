only after the fourth goal had been scored , only after this derby demolition had been completed , did @entity0 turn to the most expensive player in @entity5 football and the player who commands the highest wages			2
@entity8 and @entity9 were little more than fresh legs here on sunday , and any success @entity13 has enjoyed in his first season at @entity15 needs to be measured against the difficulties two phenomenally talented players have endured			1
but it also a measure of the qualities the @entity21 possesses that players with only a fraction of their ability are not just keeping them out of the side , but are performing as well as this			0
@entity8 and @entity9 were left on the bench by @entity0 on sunday @entity30 £ 60m man @entity29 came on for @entity31 in the 81st minute at @entity15 @entity9 replaced @entity33 @entity32 with seven minutes to play in the win over @entity35 a sixth successive @entity37 victory that cements @entity38 in third place owes much to the revival of @entity41 , @entity32 and @entity31 and the progress being made by @entity43 and @entity44			1
@entity45 once said @entity43 and @entity44 were good enough to become @entity47 ’s central defensive pairing and @entity48 , a spectator here on sunday , is sure to be encouraged by their rate of development			1
in @entity41 , @entity32 and @entity31 the transformation has been most startling , however , and credit has to go to @entity13 for the way he has managed three players who were so central to the downfall of @entity45 12 months ago			1
in fairness to @entity32 , and indeed @entity45 , the @entity33 just needed time to make the transition from @entity61 to @entity38			1
in fairness to @entity31 , he probably needed time , too , after being ejected from @entity63 by @entity64			2
@entity41 celebrates after bringing @entity38 level having earlier trailed but @entity41 is a triumph for the style of leadership @entity13 has long been recognised for : his ability to work with players on a personal basis as well as part of a collective			1
even @entity13 ’s critics recognise the skills that also made him a fine schoolteacher when he was supplementing his income as a poorly paid player in @entity79 with a career in education			0
he is clearly very good at restoring confidence and inspiring an individual , with @entity41 finally looking like the player @entity84 used to admire so much			0
@entity41 , one of five @entity85 in @entity38 ’s outfield 10 , was the outstanding player in this hugely entertaining contest , scoring the equaliser that quickly cancelled out @entity90 ’s opener , as well as providing the assists for @entity32 and @entity43 , but more to the point , responding most effectively to what , presumably , were his manager ’s instructions			1
@entity32 headed in at the far post to give @entity38 the lead and continue his fine recent form @entity31 slots under @entity100 to extend @entity38 's lead to 3 - 1 early in the second half @entity13 would have seen how vulnerable @entity35 were to the aerial threat posed by @entity104 at @entity105 on monday and it was @entity41 who delivered the crosses that enabled @entity38 ’s tallest players to punish them again , on both occasions with headers			1
exactly why the issue had not been addressed by @entity113 is anybody ’s guess			0
but if this game highlighted the skills of @entity13 , it also illustrated where @entity35 ’s beleaguered manager has fallen short this season			0
while @entity38 are in the ascendancy , @entity113 has overseen a period of decline for a stuttering @entity35 side			1
while @entity38 are now celebrating the renaissance of players like @entity41 , @entity113 faces the question of what on earth has happened to a side who were so superior to @entity38 a year ago			1
@entity43 headed in a free - kick to score @entity38 's fourth goal in the derby @entity47 manager @entity48 watched the @entity137 derby from the stands at @entity15 @entity139 lost by @entity35 in 2015 , one more than the whole of 2014			1
13 - @entity35 's position in the @entity37 form table after losing four and winning two of his last six			2
4 - the first time since losing 4 - 3 to @entity38 in 2009 that @entity35 have conceded four in the league			1
9 - @entity35 have nine points fewer than they did at this stage last season			2
70.8 - @entity35 's pass completion rate percentage at @entity15 was their worst of the season			1
it was a 3 - 0 win at @entity15 that effectively finished @entity45 at @entity38 , with the eventual champions moving 15 points clear of their neighbours that day with two games to spare			1
but this game was a microcosm of @entity35 ’s season : a decent start , marked by that first @entity90 goal , and then a period of steady , draining decline			0
since the turn of the year @entity35 have collected just 18 points from 13 games			2
compare that to @entity38 , who have taken 29 from the same number of matches			0
@entity113 was honest enough to admit that they have thrown away their title defence with the ‘ garbage ’ but the real garbage is on the pitch , in the form of some truly inept performances			0
not least away from home			0
if @entity113 had a desire to ‘ continue being noisy ’ and extend a period of dominance over their neighbours to a fifth league meeting , the evidence on sunday would suggest it was not shared by his players			0
they were a poor imitation of the side that so impressed here last year			0
nothing like the champions of @entity47			0
@entity0 shakes hands with his opposite number @entity113 after the final whistle @entity38 boss @entity13 thanked supporters for their patience after sunday 's victory @entity35 boss @entity113 has come under increasing pressure after a dismal second half of the season compared to @entity63 , @entity38 are some way short of the best in @entity47 too and both clubs will need to invest heavily again this summer to close that gap			1
but this morning @entity38 and @entity35 appear to be travelling in opposite directions , one on the rise and the other entering another period of upheaval			2
@entity211 blames financial fair play but overlooks the fact that @entity113 has actually spent more than £ 75million since last summer			0
just as he ignores that the problem is closer to home ; that he is chief among players operating on restricted power			0
at @entity15 the drop in standards at @entity35 was obvious to all , and probably explained why the atmosphere was electric			2
@entity38 ’s supporters are enjoying seeing @entity35 suffer as much as they are now beginning to appreciate the leadership of @entity13			2
his management has taken on an almost magical quality			0
judging by the fact that he can keep his two most expensive players on the bench for 80 - odd minutes and nobody even notices .			0

@entity38 beat @entity35 4 - 2 at @entity15
@entity231 moved @entity38 four points clear of @entity35 in third place in the table
@entity0 has left @entity8 and @entity9 on bench
@entity41 , @entity31 and @entity32 have all been revived
@entity43 and @entity44 are showing progress at the back
