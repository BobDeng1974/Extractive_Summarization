@entity7 , however , still is n't out of the woods			0
certainly not with a section of the club 's support			0
even as they celebrated victory , supporters made their feeling towards @entity7 crystal clear			0
one banner had : ' @entity7 thanks for the memories but it 's time to say goodbye ' , emblazoned across it , another read : ' enough is enough , @entity7 out			2
' ‘ i do n’t want to comment on that , ’ said the @entity10 manager			0
‘ i try to do my best for the club that i love			0
we are very united with the players and staff around the team , that ’s all you can do			0
’ nevertheless , the @entity110 will return to @entity111 with renewed optimism as his side recorded their first league win since november 1 and are finally seeing key players return to fitness			2
he was able to revert back to his preferred central defensive partnership of @entity118 and @entity63 , the @entity110 international fully - recovered from an @entity121 problem to make his first appearance in two months			2
likewise , @entity25 made his first start since the end of august following a broken ankle at the @entity4 , though keeper @entity126 again missed out with a hip injury as third choice @entity61 made his second consecutive start			1
for @entity21 , all eyes and hopes were pinned on @entity132 , who was making his first appearance since details of his drink - driving offence emerged earlier this week			1
interestingly , @entity15 started the clash out on the left with the fit again @entity25 preferred as the lone striker			1
following their morale - boosting win over @entity142 on wednesday night , @entity10 started brightly - @entity69 and @entity144 testing @entity36 with efforts from the edge of the box inside the opening 10 minutes			1
after a run of one win in seven , @entity60 's side were understandably tentative in the opening exchanges			2
@entity10 forward @entity144 fires a shot against @entity21 as the @entity18 dominated the opening stages of the game @entity21 's @entity50 attempts to evade the attention of @entity10 midfielder @entity67 at the @entity4 on saturday @entity10 were forced into an early change , @entity65 replacing @entity64 at left back as the @entity18 ' rotten luck regarding injuries continued in the 23rd minute			1
@entity36 was called upon again in the 25th minute denying @entity15 in a one - on - one following @entity67 's through ball			2
the @entity18 were then denied a penalty by referee @entity80 after @entity25 fell in the box following a tangle with @entity48			2
some disgruntled @entity10 fans held out a banner suggesting manager @entity7 leaves his job after a mixed start to the season @entity169 of @entity21 tries to fend off @entity15 's challenge during another @entity10 attack @entity172 miles @entity21 109.6 68.1 @entity47 90 11.8 7.3 @entity50 90 11.3 7.0 @entity44 90 10.4 6.5 @entity10 111.2 69.1 @entity66 90 12.5 7.8 @entity67 90 11.9 7.4 @entity69 90 11.6 7.2 @entity21 's hearts were in their mouths two minutes later when @entity25 dispossessed @entity36 , who had gone walkabout near the left hand touchline , but the @entity110 failed to direct the ball into an empty net from a tight angle			1
@entity36 was smiling , his manager was n't as amused , though , as @entity10 asserted their authority			0
@entity25 and @entity15 combined to set up up @entity69 on the edge of the area , but , with time to steady himself , the @entity184 sent another shot straight at @entity36			1
@entity10 were well on top at this point			0
but @entity7 and the visiting support had seen this all before			0
not turning domination in goals is becoming somewhat of an unwanted @entity10 trait of late			0
@entity7 knew it , too , pacing anxiously along his technical area despite the fact his side were fully in charge			0
the chances kept coming - and being wasted ; @entity67 this time firing wide from 16 yards after @entity48 foolishly dallied on the ball on the edge of his own area			0
had @entity51 produced a better pass after easily beating @entity204 down the left on the stroke of half - time then @entity7 would have had much more to think about at half - time			0
the second half started in similar fashion to the first , @entity15 showing indecisiveness in front of goal , choosing to pass to @entity67 when shooting would have been a much better option in the 51st minute			2
mertesacker then fired wide from the edge of a crowded penalty area after @entity36 fumbled under pressure from @entity25			0
then , in the 54th minute , came @entity21 's best opening off the game , @entity132 springing @entity10 's offside trap only to shoot into the side - netting with @entity61 to beat			1
@entity223 was in goal for the @entity18 but was rarely troubled until the closing stages when @entity21 pressed to equalise @entity226 international @entity69 was in fine form for the @entity18 on saturday as the midfielder helped @entity10 to victory @entity34 striker @entity132 , challenging @entity63 , hit the bar in the closing stages but could n't prevent defeat for @entity21 @entity10 boss @entity7 ( left ) cut a frustrated figure on the touchline on saturday before @entity15 's winning header @entity204 , returning to right back for @entity10 , chases down another pass at the @entity4 on saturday afternoon @entity10 striker @entity25 keeps his eye on the ball as @entity44 grapples with the @entity110 international it was n't the finish the striker was looking for in front of @entity34 manager @entity244 , who was at the @entity4 yesterday			1
nor was it the finish @entity8 wanted , who knew full well a chance like that may not arrive again in the 35 minutes remaining			0
and just five minutes later , @entity21 paid the ultimate price as @entity69 sped past @entity169 down @entity10 's left before standing up an inch perfect cross for @entity15 to head past @entity36			1
it was no more than @entity10 deserved , not that would have been any comfort to @entity60 who would of had @entity132 's miss still in the forefront of his thoughts			2
@entity21 midfielder @entity46 wrestles for possession with @entity34 and @entity10 left back @entity65 @entity48 takes aim with a pass before @entity144 of @entity10 can dispossess him @entity69 instructs team - mate @entity67 after the @entity184 left possession to the @entity264 as @entity10 attempted another attack @entity21 supporters were just as frustrated , directing their anger at @entity60 in the 76th minute , showing their displeasure at his decision to replace @entity51 with @entity271 crystal clear with cries of ' you do n't know what you 're doing			1
' but 10 minutes from the end their jeers nearly turned to cheers after @entity132 hit the crossbar with a towering header from substitute @entity45 's cross			1
@entity47 then smashed a 20 yard effort narrowly wide of @entity61 's left hand post as the @entity21 pressed for an unlikely leveller			2
but @entity10 held on to secure a vital victory			0
@entity21 keeper @entity36 fails to keep out @entity15 's second half header as @entity10 secured a vital three points match winner @entity15 applauds the travelling @entity10 fans with team - mates per @entity118 and @entity66 click here for all the stats and graphics from the @entity4 including @entity15 's goal ( below )			1

@entity15 headed the @entity18 ahead on the hour after a fine cut back from @entity69
the @entity18 move up to fourth in the @entity297 before the other weekend *fixtures*
@entity132 hit the bar in the final ten minutes as @entity21 searched for an equaliser
