reform : critically ill patients will be able to benefit from new drugs years before they are approved for general use under new fast - track rules patients with life - threatening and serious diseases will be able to get new drugs years before they would normally be available under a government - backed scheme			1
the fast - track plan would help patients with cancers or dementia where there is no effective treatment left from existing medicines			2
it will mean drugs can be prescribed on the @entity19 – paid for by the manufacturer – before they are licensed			1
this could mean new medicines become widely available to desperate patients ‘ several years ’ earlier than under the existing system			2
the prostate cancer drug abiraterone , for example , could have been available around two years before it was licensed			2
the @entity27 will examine data from ongoing trials in order to approve a drug as a ‘ promising innovative medicine ’			0
it will also need to gain a positive scientific opinion , saying the benefits outweigh the risks , which it is hoped would be granted within two to three months			0
health secretary @entity39 said the early access scheme due to start next month would boost industry by attracting investment and help patients			1
he said ‘ this ground - breaking scheme will provide cutting edge medicines earlier , give hope to patients and their families and save lives			0
and as part of our strategy for life sciences it will create more jobs and opportunities for people , helping secure a better future for our country			0
’ the plan means medicines will be given to patients before the @entity62 ( @entity62 ) has decided whether to approve @entity19 funding			1
once a drug has been fully licensed for use , it will come out of the early access scheme and be assessed by @entity62			1
@entity68 , chief executive of @entity70 , said ‘ time is of the essence for many cancer patients , particularly those with more advanced disease			0
it can mean the difference between life and death			0
‘ therefore this scheme , which has at its heart the potential to bring promising new medicines to patients faster , is to be warmly welcomed			0
‘ the scheme should also make it more attractive for life sciences companies to conduct their development activities in the @entity87 , which will bring a multitude of benefits to the population			0
’ it is thought anything from one to 12 drugs a year could qualify for early access			1
although doctors are currently allowed to prescribe unlicensed drugs by taking personal responsibility for a ‘ named patient ’ , the new system will provide confidence to them and patients that the safety risks and benefits have been professionally assessed prior to licensing			1
however , the individual doctor would still be liable if anything goes wrong , according to the @entity106			1
under the plan , pharmaceutical firms will be able to gain experience of how their medicines are being used in the @entity19 , it said			1
firms would also ‘ work closely with regulators to look at the value of the drugs , gaining guidance and advice much earlier in the regulatory process			2
’ drug companies would still be able to offer new medicines via trials and on compassionate grounds			0
medication : it is thought anything from one to 12 drugs a year could qualify for early access @entity129 , chief executive of the @entity130 , said ‘ this is a welcome step by the @entity106 towards addressing the lengthy and at times convoluted process of bringing a drug to market			1
‘ for people with some forms of muscular dystrophy , every day counts and a year could be the difference between walking unaided and using a powered wheelchair , between breathing independently and needing a ventilator to support lungs through the night			2
‘ the long wait for potential treatments to make their way through three stages of clinical trials can be agonising - particularly when followed by a drawn - out licensing process			0
we need urgency in the supply of safe and effective treatments to these families			0
’ @entity155 , director of value and access at the @entity157 ( @entity157 ) , said ‘ the early access to medicines scheme will benefit patients , the @entity19 and the @entity87 clinical research community , of which our industry is a part			1
‘ most importantly , it means that patients with some life - threatening or seriously debilitating conditions - without adequate treatment options - will be able to get faster access to important innovative medicines as these will be made available before launch , following an assessment by the @entity27			1
’ dr @entity173 , chief executive of the @entity27 , said ‘ we are delighted that the @entity174 to @entity175 will be launched in april 2014			0
' the scheme is intended to enable patient access to medicines for treatment of life threatening or seriously debilitating conditions where there is an unmet need			2
this is a major new development in medicines policy in the @entity87			0

new plan means drugs can be prescribed on @entity19 before they are licensed
anything from one to 12 drugs a year could qualify for early access
but individual doctors would still be liable if anything goes wrong
