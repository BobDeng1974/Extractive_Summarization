an mp has questioned why it took police so long to release cctv images of two suspects wanted for questioning over the attack , which happened in @entity21 on june 2			1
@entity22 only released the images yesterday - almost three months after the incident happened in a toilet in a @entity27 store			1
@entity2 , the mp for @entity30 and @entity31 's candidate for @entity3 's first police commissioner , said it was ' common sense ' that issuing the pictures sooner would have helped the investigation			1
he said : ' there is unease about why it has taken so long for those pictures to be released			0
' i think the police do have to give a detailed answer at to why this delay took place			0
' it ’s not easy in situations like this , [ given ] the need to respect the victim			0
' but i think common sense tells most people that early publication of @entity53 both helps the police , because members of the public hopefully come forward and help identify the attacker , and of course , in the worse case , it would help prevent an early repetition			2
' the boy 's ordeal began when he used a public toilet in @entity3 's @entity64 and became aware of two men staring at him			1
’ the boy was then frogmarched by the men – one white and the other @entity81 – out of the @entity64 in @entity3			0
led by the arm , he was forcibly taken about 50 yards away to the nearby @entity27 store			1
as shoppers and staff walked around the four - storey department store , oblivious to the boy ’s ordeal , the teenager was forced into a lift by the two men			2
he was taken by the lift upstairs , where he was marched into a men ’s toilet and raped by the @entity81 man			0
yesterday a police source said the attack was ‘ absolutely horrendous ’			2
scene : the boy was raped in a toilet in this @entity27 store in @entity21 the source said : ‘ the attack on a child in a busy department store on a saturday afternoon will put fear and dread into the heart of every parent			1
‘ if teenagers are not safe from paedophile predators in the heart of a busy city , then it is extremely worrying			0
’ the teenager reported the incident and was taken to a rape crisis centre at @entity117 where he was checked by doctors			0
a team of officers has been working with the traumatised victim to build up a picture of what happened and to obtain forensic evidence			0
@entity22 said the cctv images of the men were circulated to local businesses and they had waited for the results of forensic tests , which took some time to complete			1
the force said it also had to wait for the boy to be video - interviewed before making a public appeal			1
speaking as the cctv images were released , detective sergeant @entity133 said : ‘ this young victim has been absolutely devastated by what happened to him			1
‘ what makes this incident doubly shocking is that he was marched across a busy part of the city centre during the late afternoon on saturday			0
' devastated ' : the boy was attacked after being approached by two men in the @entity64 in @entity3 investigation : police are confident that @entity3 shoppers may have seen the boy 's attackers either before or after the incident ‘ however , this means i am confident that shoppers may have seen the offenders either before or after the incident			2
‘ i want people to take a good look at the men in these images and tell me who they are			0
’ his colleague , superintendent @entity163 , said : ‘ when you think about a 14 - year - old out in the city centre at that time of the evening , when the footfall is pretty heavy and there are a lot of people about , the fact that someone could be marched across the street and into a store in this way is pretty horrific			2
’ he added that he found the attack ‘ particularly disturbing ’ , saying : ‘ when i think about family or friends who could have been out in the @entity64 at that time of night , it disturbs me greatly			0
’ a spokesman for @entity27 said : ' we were shocked to hear about this incident and would like to reassure everyone this is an isolated case			2
