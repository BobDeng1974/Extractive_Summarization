he said : ‘ the @entity34 have now ruled out asking the very wealthy to pay even just a bit more in tax to help the ongoing fiscal effort			0
instead , they ’ve said they ’ll take billions more from the welfare budget			0
’ he added : ‘ we ’ll finish the job ( of eliminating the deficit ) , of course we will – but we ’ll finish it in a way that is fair			0
‘ so not just through further spending cuts , but also by asking those with the broadest shoulders to make some additional contributions too , including for instance through our banded mansion tax - extending new tax bands to higher value properties			2
