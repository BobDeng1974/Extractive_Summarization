by @entity0 it may not be the most fashion - forward footwear you 've seen , but these bizarre sandals could help save an astronaut body from deteriorating			0
developed by @entity7 , a pair was today sent to the @entity8 in the hope of better understanding of how heavy loads can damage an astronauts ' bones			1
the @entity15 sandals act as a high tech measurement system working in tandem with the @entity8 ’s @entity18 ( @entity19 )			1
developed by @entity7 , a pair was today sent to the @entity8 in the hope of gaining a better understanding of how heavy loads damage an astronauts ' bones @entity27 , an @entity8 exercise hardware specialist , demonstrates the use of the @entity15 on the @entity18 @entity30 helps the astronauts perform weight - bearing exercise to maintain bone and muscle mass while in microgravity			1
‘ @entity30 is a sophisticated exercise device , ’ said @entity27 , @entity8 exercise hardware specialist			1
‘ although it has helped @entity7 provide better health outcomes for crew members , there is still progress to be made in understanding the effects of exercise on bone and muscle health , and the @entity15 will help us do that			1
’ using the @entity15 , researchers will measure exercise loads and ground reaction forces on an astronaut			1
these are the forces supplied by the ground to a body in contact with it			0
the device measures force in three axes : up and down , side - to - side and front - to - back			0
it also captures the torque , or twisting force , applied under foot during an @entity66 exercise			0
‘ we are eager to understand how joint forces may be different between exercise performed on the ground and in space , and force shoe technology might help us do this in future investigations , ’ said mr @entity27			1
improving researchers ’ understanding of exercise performance in microgravity will help create better space workouts that improve bone and muscle strength			1
researchers will ask two to four crew members to collect static load and dynamic exercise data while wearing the shoes , which look like high - tech sandals			1
during the static load test , crew members will be asked to set the @entity30 to provide specific loads in the same way they would set loads on a weightlifting machine at the gym			2
the effects of zero gravity on our muscles , bones and joints have been extensively studied			0
but while living in space is known to weaken our immune system , no one is sure how our cells are affected in the long - term by prolonged exposure to a weightless environment			0
now a new @entity8 experiment will seek to answer that very question , and it could provide us with important information on the risk of spaceflight to astronauts			2
known as the @entity116 , the experiment was carried to the @entity8 ( @entity8 ) by @entity119 ’s @entity118 experiment contains a cargo of immune cells			2
in zero gravity , various immune system functions are known to be impaired			0
in particular phagocytes , cells that protect our body from harmful foreign bodies , are unable to work properly			0
a research team is currently studying the structure and metabolism of these phagocytes while they are on the @entity8 they will then lift the exercise bar and stand still on @entity30 while the shoes collect data			1
they will also perform dynamic exercises included squats , deadlifts and bicep curls			0
as crew members perform these exercises , the @entity15 , which acts like an enhanced bathroom scale that measures loads applied downward as well as during front - to - back and side - to - side movements			1
@entity145 will be transmitted via bluetooth technology to computers on the space station and researchers on @entity150 will receive this data a couple of days later			2
‘ as we prepare for future missions to asteroids , @entity155 and beyond , we need to think about minimising and miniaturising equipment because spacecraft will be smaller , ’ said mr @entity27			0
‘ the @entity15 is a great example of the way we can shrink some of our research tools for future missions			0
’ lessons learned from exercise performed during long duration missions in microgravity can also be directly applied to populations here on @entity150			2
for instance , the results could be used to help people who have restricted movement due to injury , ageing , busy lifestyles , or confined work and living spaces			1
during the static load test , crew members will be asked to set the @entity30 to provide specific loads in the same way they would set loads on a weightlifting machine at the gym			2
@entity186 astronaut @entity185 is pictured here working out on @entity30			0

@entity15 acts as a high tech measurement system for the @entity8 ’s @entity30
@entity30 lets astronauts exercise to maintain their bone and muscle strength
the space sandals will measure exercise loads and ground reaction forces
the results could be used to help people who have restricted movement on @entity150 due to injury , ageing , busy lifestyles or confined work spaces
