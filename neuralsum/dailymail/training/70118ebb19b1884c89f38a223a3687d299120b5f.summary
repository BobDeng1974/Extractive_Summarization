he also tweeted : ' you want me to get serious , become a gormless fool like the rest of you ? not thanks , i 'll stay true to myself and plot your child 's death '			2
incredibly , on her own @entity4 account , mrs @entity57 did not react angrily , and calmly wrote : ' here we go again , i 'm not interested ... # @entity60			1
' two years ago she suffered further after trolls set up a sickening @entity64 group mocking her son ’s death called : ' what happened to @entity3 was f * * * * * * hilarious '			1
there was a successful campaign to shut it down and internet users have again flocked to support mrs @entity57			1

now need the police to catch the idiot behind it '			2
@entity78 tweeted : ' sure somebody from @ @entity80 will be investigating this sick individual			2

' the people who send sick messages need to know that they can not get away with it by hiding behind false names			2
' what has been said by these pathetic trolls is meant to hurt me and my family , but it does not work			1
' i 've become pretty thick - skinned , so i do not take any notice of what they say because they are not even worth thinking twice about			2
' police must be able to prosecute the culprits to send a clear message to twisted individuals that they will not get away with insulting and harassing people			0
' i hope they find them , charge them and give them the stiffest penalty that they can get			0
they need to be taught a sharp lesson			0
' reaction : the discovery of the account has led to hundreds of tweets from people demanding action from @entity4 and the police @entity95 councillor @entity136 had shared a photo of his two - day - old nephew only to be sent death threats by a troll posing as @entity141			1
he demanded a response from @entity4 after the abuse , and has now been invited to hold an emergency meeting with @entity146 managing director @entity145			2
@entity136 said : ' these are the most extreme tweets i have ever seen , people having a thrill from this is quite frankly disgusting			0
' i contacted @entity145 and heard back within ten minutes from him looking to arrange a meeting with his team			0
' it 's about time we prosecute the one responsible for this			0
we 're not blaming the police or @entity4 but they have to work together in order to stop this for good			1
' mrs @entity57 has agreed to attend a telephone conference with @entity4 chiefs in order to discuss the current problems giving online bullies a platform to target people with abuse			1
' it is time @entity4 made it a priority to close down trolls and i want to meet them to explain that this is something that they need to make a top priority , ' she said			1
' they ca n't just wash their hands of it			0
they need to be proactive			0
they should have a ' report abuse ' button on @entity4 to silence these trolls immediately			1
' @entity183 : @entity3 was found on a railway line where he was battered to death by @entity141 and @entity27 @entity141 and @entity27 were 10 when they abducted @entity43			1
the pair walked the toddler several miles to a railway line in @entity190 , where they tortured and killed him , leaving his body on a train line where it was hit by a train			0
after a public outcry and release of the haunting @entity23 footage , the two boys were arrested about a week later			0
@entity141 was first given a new identity when he and @entity27 were sent to a young offenders ' institution for murdering the toddler			0
a second new identity was created for him when he was released in 2001 , and he was given a third identity after he was sent back to jail in 2010 for possessing child abuse images			0
@entity141 left prison in september last year with a fourth new identity after being hauled back to prison in 2010 for possessing child porn			0
this took the total cost of his secret identities to £ 1million			0
and despite recommendations by an official review into how @entity141 was allowed to re-offend last time he was released , he has not been fitted with a new sat - nav gps tagging bracelet			0
the device would allow probation officers to remotely monitor his every move			0
former @entity225 mandarin sir @entity223 said the tag could stop him sneaking back to @entity95 – which he did repeatedly last time			0
under the terms of his release , @entity141 has been banned from trawling sex sites on the internet and once again ordered to stay away from @entity9			0
currently the gps tracker is only available in ‘ extreme ’ circumstances and , to the dismay of @entity43 ’s family , @entity141 has not been selected by officials to wear the device .			1
