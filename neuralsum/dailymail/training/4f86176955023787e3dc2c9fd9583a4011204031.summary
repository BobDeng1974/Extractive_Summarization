by @entity0 published : 16:00 est , 1 june 2013 updated : 16:00 est , 1 june 2013 the key to beating one of the most common causes of stroke could be an umbrella - like heart implant , according to new research			1
about a quarter of the population are born with a minor cardiac defect – a hole in one of the heart chambers known as a patent formal ovale ( @entity15 ) – that usually causes no symptoms but increases stroke risk			1
the new procedure involves placing a tiny implant that looks like a two - sided umbrella , known as an occluder , to plug the hole			1
about 150,000 @entity23 suffer a first stroke every year , and in eight in ten cases it is due to the blood supply to the brain being blocked by a blood clot – an ischaemic stroke			1
in 60 per cent of these patients , the reason for the stroke can usually be linked to coronary heart disease , and the build - up of fatty deposits on the arterial walls			1
this furring – known as plaque – hinders blood flow and means clots are more likely to form , then break off and travel to the brain			0
yet in half the remaining patients – for whom their stroke has no obvious cause – a @entity15 may be the trigger			1
many stroke patients are young and seemingly fit , such as broadcaster @entity49 , who suffered a stroke aged 53 in january , though a @entity15 has not been suggested as the cause			1
in cases where a hole in the heart is suspected , the closure operation has now been found to reduce the risk of another stroke by up to 70 per cent			1
no rain on this parade : the ' umbrella implant surgery ' only takes 45 minutes and could prevent thousands of strokes each year @entity62 , a history teacher and housemaster at @entity64 in @entity65 , was one of the first people in the @entity23 to have the device implanted to prevent a second stroke			1
he suffered his first one three weeks after his 50th birthday			0
at the time , he was fit – running 30 to 40 miles a week – but he was taken ill on the last day of the school term			0
after four days of investigation in hospital , @entity62 was found to have a @entity15			0
‘ i was told that closing the @entity15 would significantly reduce the chances of a further stroke , so i decided to go ahead , ’ he says			2
‘ the procedure took about 45 minutes and i was awake throughout			0
’ during the operation , an incision is made in a vein in the groin under local anaesthetic			0
the occluder device , which is made of two wire mesh discs encasing a polyester fabric , is folded and put into a tube ( catheter )			0
it is then inserted into the vein and manoeuvred into the heart via the circulatory system , and into the open hole			1
broken heart : the surgery closes a hole in the heart which is a known cause of blood clots once in place , the device is released and unfolds so that there is a disc either side of the @entity15			1
a small piece of linking material that connects the two discs is tightened so that the hole is sandwiched between them			2
the procedure can be carried out as a day case , but most patients are kept in for observation			2
dr @entity108 , consultant cardiologist and director of cardiac catheter labs at @entity110 , who fits the devices , says the implant offers a ‘ belt and braces ’ approach , and is given alongside blood - thinning medication			1
‘ statistics show that the operation will lower the risk of a second stroke from two to three per cent a year to about one per cent			1
but none of my patients has had a recurrence , ’ says dr @entity108			2
‘ the procedure is safe and seems a good option for those who have recovered well from a stroke and have a large @entity15			2
’ the new research shows that plugging the @entity15 is more effective than blood - thinning medication , such as warfarin or aspirin , in reducing risk of recurrent stroke			1
patients in the multi-centre study , whose average age was 46 , had a 51 to 73 per cent drop in risk			2
@entity62 recalls : ‘ i was able to watch the operation as it happened on a tv screen in the theatre			0
it is quite interesting to see inside your own heart			0
‘ i had no side effects from the procedure , and nearly four years on i have had no further strokes or mobility problems , and i feel fine			0
‘ for me , the sealing of the @entity15 has been a success and i believe it is something anyone in the same boat should seriously think about doing			0
i went back to work full - time about five months after the stroke			2
‘ one odd effect of the stroke is that i have poorer visual recognition for faces and paintings			0
on the plus side , my brush with mortality has made me less prone to anxiety because it puts things into perspective			0
‘ i still have double vision , but that is corrected with special spectacles			0
it means i can not get the skis out any more , but that is no great loss to me , nor to skiing			0

new research show ' umbrella ' implant could save thousands
near *25* per cent of all stroke patients suffer from ' hole in the heart ' - defect
about 150,000 @entity23 suffer their first strike every year
