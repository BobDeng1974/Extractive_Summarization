@entity0 believes @entity1 will not make @entity3 's move permanent at the end of the season and questioned the effectiveness of his strike partnership with @entity8 after sunday 's 1 - 1 draw with @entity10			1
@entity12 's side had defensive midfielder @entity13 to thank after his 93rd minute equaliser earned a point against @entity10 in an encounter where @entity17 and @entity3 stuttered throughout			1
and @entity0 feels @entity1 's woes stem from the array of attacking players manager @entity20 spent millions on accumulating after taking the reigns at @entity22 last year			1
@entity3 ( centre ) struggled to impress for @entity1 against @entity10 @entity8 ( centre ) partnered @entity3 ( second right ) in attack in the game for @entity1 @entity0 believes that @entity1 will not sign for @entity1 on a permanent contract ' i do n't see @entity3 staying , it 's something they have to address , ' @entity0 said on @entity31 after the game			1
' i ca n't believe ( @entity33 ) @entity32 did n't come on at some stage of the game			0
@entity3 and @entity17 lack movement and i do n't think this is a partnership that 's working			2
' everyone talks about @entity1 and that they need a centre - back - they have one of the best defensive records in the league , although ( @entity43 ) @entity42 is part of that , but that 's the reason you pay him			2
' the problems are at the other end of the pitch			0
' @entity0 's co-pundit , ex @entity1 striker @entity51 , is undecided on whether he thinks @entity3 should remain beyond this season			1
' the jury is still out on @entity3 , ' @entity51 explained			2
' he had a great opportunity today but it has nâ€™t materialised at this point of time , maybe the system is the issue and not the actual players			0
' former @entity1 strike @entity51 is undecided on whether he thinks @entity3 should stay @entity12 ( right ) shakes the hand of his goalscorer @entity13 ( left ) @entity63 ( left ) celebrates his 93rd minute goal for @entity1 alongside @entity65 ( right ) former @entity66 defender @entity0 also queried @entity20 's decision to drop captain @entity68 into midfield - away from his traditional role in attack			1
' @entity68 's position is not right , he was playing as a defensive midfield player , ' @entity0 said			0
' why is he ( @entity20 ) not putting @entity68 up off the front , with two strikers showing such a lack of movement ? they had less touches today than @entity42			0
' @entity1 fell behind to @entity10 after @entity81 's brilliant finish four minutes into the second half			1
but @entity20 rolled the dice by throwing on @entity65 on 72 as his side turned to a long ball style and in the dying moments , @entity13 volleyed in @entity88 's cross			2
@entity0 commended the character in @entity1 's team and @entity20 's decision to ditch his regular possession style and go direct in search of a goal			1
' it 's not luck , ' @entity0 insisted			0
' @entity1 have done it too often over the years			0
they 've done it again today			0
how many times have we seen @entity1 and they have n't played well and they 've still got a result ? @entity1 captain @entity68 ( right ) struggled to ignite his team 's play at @entity105 from midfield @entity107 made a number of fine saves before @entity10 opened the scoring in the 49th minute ' he put @entity65 on and went long			1
in the past @entity1 would n't have done that but i admire that			0
you talk about principles , sometimes you have to change them when it 's not working and credit to @entity20 , he did			0
' @entity0 later queried what @entity1 's best formation is on his @entity121 account			1
' @entity1 are notorious for playing wingers & in @entity123 , @entity124 , @entity125 & @entity88 they have players who can fill those roles but , when a foreign manager comes in especially he will have his own ideas rather than adhere to the club 's traditions , ' @entity0 wrote			2
' that 's something they may have to get used to now & in the future			0

@entity3 and @entity8 struggled against @entity10
@entity0 does not think @entity3 will be at @entity1 next season
@entity0 credited @entity20 for ditching his *preferred* style to get a point
