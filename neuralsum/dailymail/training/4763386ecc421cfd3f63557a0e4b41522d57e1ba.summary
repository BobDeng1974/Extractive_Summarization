@entity10 hugged his lawyers , was kissed by wife and shook hands with friends and supporters after his sentence was pronounced			2
the government had said in a presentence memorandum that @entity10 , 42 , should serve some time for destroying documents and fabricating others in a civil lawsuit he brought against @entity0 in 2009			1
no prison term , it said , would send a ' terrible message ' to others who might engage in similar conduct			0
sentencing : @entity10 , left , leaves @entity29 federal court today with attorney , @entity30 after he was sentenced to two years ' probation and 300 hours of community service long face ? @entity10 , center , leaves @entity29 federal court in @entity35 friday today ' after spending a great amount of time , energy and legal effort , all of us at @entity0 are glad this matter is finally behind us , ' @entity0 president and ceo @entity36 said in a statement			1
' we hope this case will serve as a clear reminder to all of the importance of fair compensation for those who gather and produce original news content			0
' prosecutors had told @entity54 magistrate judge @entity53 in @entity29 that @entity10 had ' both an ideological and financial motive ' to alter evidence in his favour after basing his poster on one of the @entity0 's photographs			1
they said he did so over several weeks , engaging in behaviour that ' can not be dismissed as remotely impulsive or the product of a moment of bad judgment			0
' ' this was not a mere failure to preserve documents , ' the government wrote			0
' this was the intentional destruction of evidence and the intentional manufacture of false evidence			0
the defendant knew exactly what he was doing when he created the fake documents and sought to destroy the deleted documents			0
' they noted that revenues at three companies he controlled doubled from roughly $ 3million in 2007 to $ 6million in 2009 while he was honoured repeatedly , including being chosen to design the official poster of @entity5 's 2009 inauguration and commissioned to create the cover image of @entity5 for @entity85 's 2008 @entity84 , which was displayed in an exhibition at the @entity87			1
too similar : a poster of president @entity5 , right , by @entity10 is shown with this april 27 , 2006 file photo of then - sen. @entity5 by @entity0 photographer @entity90 at the @entity91 defence attorneys argued that a prison term was not warranted , noting that the misdemeanour charge carries a potential of only six months in prison			1

iconic : the image became iconic in the 2008 election , left , and earned @entity10 many honours , including the image being displayed at the @entity87 in @entity109 , right in their sentencing memorandum , defence lawyers described @entity10 as a devoted husband and father of two young daughters who runs companies that employ almost 30 people and who serves as the creative force behind a clothing line that employs another 80 people			2
they called his crime the ' worst mistake of his life ' and said he altered evidence ' not to better his chances of winning the lawsuit or to enrich himself , but out of fear of embarrassment			0
' the lawyers wrote that @entity10 , who has diabetes , has already suffered ' significant damage to his reputation , ' adding that an internet search of his name ' now produces results not just about his artistic and civic accomplishments , but also many web sites degrading him for his misconduct			0

@entity10 used @entity0 photo to create iconic @entity5 2008 ' @entity142 ' poster
artist 's revenues doubled as his poster *received* many *prestigious* awards
