by @entity0 deadly allergies mean this little boy must spend most of his life in isolation but it does not mean he gets out of doing his school homework			1
in place of seven - year - old @entity8 , he sends a robot to school , allowing him to answer questions in class and even be part of schoolyard gossip , all while he sits in the safety of his bedroom , five miles away			1
the amazing technology , called the @entity19 robot , has an interactive screen allowing @entity21 to interact with his classmates , despite never having met them face - to - face , at @entity25 in @entity26 , @entity27			1
mother @entity51 said the $ 5,000 ( £ 3,100 ) robot stops @entity21 from becoming a social recluse			2
she said : ‘ the children do n't call the machine the “ @entity19 ” , it 's just @entity21			1
‘ the @entity19 is basically a virtual @entity21			1
it helps him feel included , and realise that he still has to go to school the same as any other child			2
‘ the only thing that 's different is @entity21 is not in the classroom			0
‘ he 's required to do everything every other kid does in the class			0
he does n't get any special treatment , because he has to be treated just the same as everybody else			0
’ part of the class : the robot means @entity21 can go to school like any other child , allowing him to have a chance at having a proper childhood five miles away : @entity21 uses his computer at home which sends wireless signals to the robot at school enabling him to see his teacher , the blackboard and his classmates , as well as to move about the school there is a high - definition camera on his computer at his bedroom desk and on the top of the @entity19 machine , which stands at about the height of a primary school pupil , and is on wheels , making it mobile like a segway			1
from his home in @entity98 , @entity27 , @entity21 uses a computer screen to send wireless signals to the @entity101 , enabling him to see his teacher , the blackboard , and the other children in his class , as well as to move about the school			1
@entity108 said the robot is the ideal solution to @entity21 debilitating condition			1
she said : ‘ @entity21 has so many allergies that can be fatal to him , many of them are airborne , and we just ca n't risk his life by letting him mix with other children			2
‘ if my elder son , @entity122 , occasionally has friends over to the house , they have to shower and scrub down like they 've been exposed to radiation			0
not a recluse : the amazing technology , known as @entity129 , makes @entity21 feel included and his mother @entity108 says ' the children do n't call the machine the " @entity19 " , it 's just @entity21 ' deadly allergies : the boy has so many deadly allergies , many airborne , that can be fatal and so he is unable to mix with other children			1
when he is in contact with other people , they must shower , scrub down and wear clothes washed and ironed by @entity21 's mother honour to have him : @entity144 , the principal at @entity25 said it is a ' great opportunity ' to have @entity21 able to attend the school through the robot ‘ i have to keep set of clothes that i have washed and ironed that i have to ask guests to wear , to make sure @entity21 never comes into contact with his allergies			1
‘ he has been in the intensive care unit three times after suffering near deadly reactions in the past and hospitalised countless times			1
‘ i ca n't ask every child in a school to constantly scrub their hands , brush their teeth and use mouthwash in case they have come into contact with any nuts			2
‘ it 's not practical and it 's not fair but i also do n't think @entity21 should be denied the chance of a proper childhood , so the robot is the ideal solution			2
’ the family had not heard of the @entity19 until local education bosses suggested the newly - developed technology as a possibility when @entity21 was due to start school this year			1
listen and learns : @entity21 's first - grade teacher @entity179 said that the robot 's flashing light , which @entity21 uses to answer a question , is just ' like another hand in the room ' the school ’s principal @entity144 said : ‘ there was no hesitation in us accepting @entity21			1
‘ i do n't know if you 'd get that every place			0
that 's just how we are here			0
‘ a lot of people look at it as a challenge , we look at it as a great opportunity			0
we feel like it 's an honour to have him here			0
’ @entity21 ’s first - grade teacher @entity179 said : ‘ one of the great things about the @entity19 is that @entity21 could turn and talk			1
‘ i could say , “ could you go join me on the carpet ? ” and he would			0
‘ when he would turn on his light , it was like another hand up in the room			0
’ @entity21 was diagnosed with eosinophilic esophagitis disease , an allergic inflammatory response in the oesophagus , when he was just six - months - old along with anaphylactic shock syndrome , respiratory distress syndrome and asthma			1
' boy in a bubble ' : @entity21 was diagnosed with eosinophilic esophagitis disease , an allergic inflammatory response in the esophagus , and is restricted to eating just corn , apples and potatoes as well as being unable to go to school , @entity21 survives on a restricted diet , eating just corn , apple and potatoes			1
@entity108 , a social worker , said : ‘ he 's a walking time bomb			0
‘ he also suffers from severe skin allergies			2
his hands get red and scaly easily			0
they become so irritated , sometimes the skin splits open and he ca n't pick up a pen to write			0
‘ even the smell of fabric softener can cause his throat to close			0
‘ he 's almost like the boy in a bubble			0
i try to let him do some things			0
i want him to have the best life he could have			2
’ boy , not a robot : @entity21 's ( left ) family were touched when his classmates made get - well - soon cards for him after a near fatal allergic reaction , for which he has been hospitalised for several times ( right ) , drawing pictures of him as a boy , not a robot after a near - fatal allergic reaction , @entity21 ’s family were touched when his classmates made get - well - soon cards , drawing @entity21 as a boy , not a robot			1
