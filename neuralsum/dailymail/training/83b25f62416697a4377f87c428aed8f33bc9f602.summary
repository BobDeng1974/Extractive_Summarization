by @entity0 as she lay in bed after having dinner and sharing a bottle of wine at a restaurant with her husband , @entity2 - @entity1 suddenly felt her chest tighten and her heart begin racing wildly			1
for the next ten , frightening minutes , she lay in pain , waiting for the palpitations to calm down			1
but when they did n’t , she staggered across to open the window to get some air , all the while hearing her pulse thumping loudly in her ears			2
‘ i was terrified that i was about to have a heart attack , ’ says @entity18 , 38			1
terrifying effects : before she realised she was intolerant to wine @entity2 - @entity1 thought her symptoms were a heart attack ‘ i went to see my gp because this was becoming a regular occurrence most saturday nights			1
‘ i did n’t have a clue what was causing it but i was scared it was serious			2
i even stopped exercising , fearful that i might have an undetected heart problem			1
’ but she did n’t			2
in fact the pain and palpitations had a different explanation : @entity18 was experiencing an adverse reaction to the wine she so enjoyed			2
her gp explained that while thousands of @entity41 women are thought to be affected , few realise the cause of their distress is their favourite tipple because the problem is not widely written or talked about			1
yet it ’s so common , doctors have even given it a nickname : ‘ holiday heart syndrome ’			1
why ? because people who rarely drink at home will reach for a glass on holiday and suddenly suffer an unexpected reaction			1
in severe cases , it can even cause heart failure			1
a lack of research means we do not know why wine can have the effect and there ’s no cure , except to give it up			1
relieved : @entity18 has n't had a drop of wine since her diagnosis the problem is quite distinct from the well - known issues surrounding excessive consumption of alcohol , such as liver damage , reduced fertility , high blood pressure and increased risk of various cancers and heart attack			1
for , in this case , rather than many years of heavy drinking leading to problems , even relatively small amounts can lead to immediate — and terrifying — consequences			2
many complain they suffer from palpitations after less than a single glass of wine			2
@entity18 , an administration manager for a retailer , has n’t touched a drop since she was diagnosed with holiday heart syndrome five years ago and has n’t had another incident since			1
‘ i had my first attack about a decade ago after dining at a friend ’s house , ’ says @entity18 , who lives in @entity92 , @entity93 , with her husband @entity94 , 40 , and their children @entity95 , five , and @entity98 , three			2
‘ i assumed i ’d just drunk too much white wine			2
‘ but over the next few years it reached a point where it did n’t matter whether i had several glasses on a saturday night out or a couple of mouthfuls at the end of a stressful day — the physical reaction was always the same			2
‘ i was surprised but relieved when my doctor said it was a common reaction to wine since the irony is that , like millions of women , i often used to have a glass to unwind or to relax before bed			1
i have n’t touched a drop of wine since as i never want to feel so poorly again			2
’ consultant cardiologist @entity120 says the condition is becoming increasingly prevalent among those over 30 because nowadays we drink wine to relieve stress , as well as when we ’re out socially			2
‘ alcohol can trigger heart palpitations , arrhythmias — where the heart beats too slowly or too quickly , ’ explains dr @entity120			1
‘ if sustained for long periods of time , a racing heart can cause heart failure			1
meanwhile the arrythmias can lead to the development of blood clots which can cause a stroke			2
@entity137 , from the @entity138 of @entity139 , says it ’s not known why alcohol — particularly wine — is to blame , but it ’s quite common to suddenly develop an intolerance			1
‘ as we get older , ’ says dr @entity120 , ‘ our body becomes more intolerant of alcohol , our heart changes , and our blood pressure and hormones alter			1
this is a complicated cocktail that can increase a person ’s susceptibility to palpitations and arrhythmias			0
‘ you could experience this reaction to alcohol for a couple of years and then it might pass			0
again , it ’s not known exactly why			0
’ holiday heart syndrome : many people who do not usually drink at home suffer an unexpected reaction when they have wine on holiday heart palpitations are n’t the only problem that wine can cause			1
even the smallest amounts have been linked to causing extreme nausea and exacerbation of chronic skin disorders such as eczema and rosacea — a reddening of the facial skin			0
if @entity180 , 29 , has so much as a sip of wine , the rosacea that ’s plagued her from the age of 14 goes into overdrive			0
‘ within five minutes , i can feel my face burning up , ’ explains @entity180 , a business development manager for a technical company			0
the first time @entity180 , from @entity186 , noticed the problem was during her final year studying languages at @entity189			0
‘ my friends and i drank a lot of wine to calm our nerves as we revised for our final exams , ’ she says			0
‘ my skin was particularly problematic at the time and there was barely a day when the redness and sore lumps were n’t raging but i did n’t connect the two things at the time			0
‘ then , when i started work , i quickly got into the habit of having a glass of wine to unwind at the end of the day , only for my skin to flare up dramatically			0
i ’d also feel nauseous after a couple of mouthfuls			0
’ lack of research : despite the problem being a common one no one knows why wine has this effect on so many women and there is no cure it was only when she sought help from specialists a few years ago that wine was diagnosed to be the cause of her problems			1
‘ i ’ve seen many skin experts and the one thing they all agree on is that wine exacerbates rosacea considerably , possibly as a result of the amount of refined sugar it contains , ’ she says			0
@entity180 now sticks to vodka and soda as it does n’t irritate her skin			0
consultant dermatologist dr @entity232 says : ‘ you ’d think spirits and other alcohol would have the same effect but there seems to be something about wine , and red wine in particular , that many rosacea sufferers report as causing a big flare - up			0
‘ this could be down to some of the additives in the wine or the fermentation process , such as the tannins , sulphites or colourants used			0
‘ we do n’t currently understand why , but we do know that alcohol dilates the capillaries in the face and therefore the circulation			0
‘ this could be responsible for exacerbating flare - ups in rosacea sufferers as well as those with psoriasis and eczema who find their skin condition becomes almost instantly inflamed and itchy			0
again , we do n’t know exactly why , but it could be linked to alcohol dehydrating the body and skin			0
’ maybe this is why wine sales have dropped three per cent in the past year while those of spirits and liqueurs have soared by up to 20 per cent			0
or it could be because wine can stop you from sleeping too			0
@entity273 , 30 , gave up her favourite tipple , white wine , after suffering from severe insomnia — as well as a racing heart — every time she indulged			1
the first time it happened was in her early 20s , when she found she could n’t sleep after drinking even one glass			0
after many similar experiences over the years , @entity273 , a manager for the @entity282 , realised wine was causing the problem			0
‘ it was the only rational explanation as the sleeplessness and racing heart only ever happened when i drank white wine , ’ explains @entity273 , who lives in @entity290 with husband @entity291 and their five - month - old baby , @entity292			1
‘ i now stick to gin and tonic but at a friend ’s wedding recently , i forgot myself and had a glass of wine			0
’ scared : @entity18 initially thought she had an undetected heart problem that night , she could n’t sleep and found herself standing outside in the early hours with raging insomnia			1
dr @entity120 explains that although many women drink wine in the evening to help them unwind in the belief it will encourage restful sleep , wine — and alcohol in general — is a well - known cause of sleeplessness			1
‘ the human body produces an essential amino acid called glutamine which is a natural stimulant , almost like your own in - built caffeine , but alcohol suppresses its production , ’ he explains			0
‘ so when you first go to bed after a few drinks , the alcohol may have a sedative effect , but then there is what ’s called “ rebound awakening ” , where the amount of glutamine being produced suddenly increases , stimulating you to such a degree that you simply can not sleep			0
’ dr @entity329 , a gp and medical adviser to @entity332 , says that perhaps we need to call time on the culture of ‘ wine o’clock ’			0
‘ the great irony is that wine has become the drink of choice for women in the belief that a few glasses will help them to relax , and feel more sociable , ’ says dr @entity337			1
‘ but actually it ’s leading to a rise in those women suffering health problems such as palpitations , insomnia and exacerbation of skin conditions , although many of them have yet to make the link between the two			1

thousands of @entity41 women are thought to be affected
however few realise the cause is their favourite tipple
it *'s* so common doctors even give it a nickname : ' holiday heart syndrome '
in severe cases it can even cause heart failure
