' i started experimenting with food , and found that simply changing what i ate for breakfast had a huge impact on my mood and energy for that day			0
' the term [ clean eating ] is completely subjective and can mean different things to different people , but my interpretation of it was to develop a healthy relationship with food			2

' i also found great pleasure in making my food look nice , as well as taste good			0
' i am conscious that some people may find it annoying when their friends start posting foodie pics on social media , but however annoying they may find it , it is precisely what enabled me to find a healthy relationship with food and create new and delicious dishes that could then help others			2

but when it comes to health and fitness tips there is often only one question on her fans lips			0

' @entity13 says that what she eats changes every day : ' my recipes are usually created from what i fancy eating on a given day , and what i ’ve got in the fridge			1
' i usually take out all the ingredients i fancy and then try and think how i can create something tasty with them			0
' my meals are always built around a protein source , so i usually start there , for example a chicken breast , or salmon and then try and pack in some veg , such as kale , spinach or broccoli , and then add a carb source , my favourite being sweet potato			2
' i always try and experiment with seasoning too , so things like paprika , and turmeric to add some flavour			0
' she continued : ' in terms of avoiding foods , i stay away from refined sugars , and most processed foods , although i am a big bacon lover			0
' alcohol is something that i just make conscious decisions on now , so for example if i ’m going to have a drink i ’ll have a vodka and diet coke , rather than a brightly coloured alcho - pop. ' it ’s all about not feeling restricted and instead just making better choices , and ultimately enjoying being fit and healthy			0
