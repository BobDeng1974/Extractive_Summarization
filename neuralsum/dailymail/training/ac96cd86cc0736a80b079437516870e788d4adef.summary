humans have used pigeons to carry messages to desired locations for centuries , but how the birds find their way home has remained a mystery			1
now experts believe they navigate using a gyroscope - like area in their brain			0
they say that the birds use their memory of the gravity field at their home to guide them home			2
scientists believe that homing pigeons navigate using a type of gyroscope in their brain and use their memory of the gravity field at their home location to guide them back dr @entity22 of the @entity23 in @entity24 and @entity25 in @entity26 , said : ‘ there is widespread agreement that pigeons are able to determine and maintain flight - compass - directions based on solar and magnetic cues			1
’ but no - one had previously explained how the birds determine their position			2
previous studies have suggested that pigeons navigate using smells or magnetic fields			0
after decades of working with pigeons in the @entity40 , dr @entity22 teamed up with @entity42 , of the @entity43 in @entity44			2
he said : ‘ @entity46 had formulated a simplistic yet astonishing theory			0
’ the @entity44 suggested that the birds use their memory of the gravity field at their home loft for guidance			1
dr @entity22 said : ‘ i realised that he had solved the map problem by one simple assumption : birds must have a gyroscope in their brain			2
’ no - one had previously explained how the birds ( stock image ) determine their position			2
previous studies have suggested that pigeons develop ‘ map sense ’ and navigate using smells , or a geomagnetic map scinetists believe that huge flocks of birds decide when to change direction in mid flight by using a kind of ' democratic hierarchy '			1
in 2010 , a team from @entity73 and @entity74 strapped tiny global position systems ( gps ) to pigeons to work out how they operated as a well - ordered group rather than chaotic individuals			0
they recorded the flight paths of individual birds and then analysed interactions between them			0
scinetists found that pigeon flocks use a flexible system of leadership where almost every member plays a part , but high - ranking birds have more power			0
to conduct their study , the researchers fitted miniature gps loggers weighing less than one ounce into custom - made backpacks carried by flocks of up to 10 homing pigeons			1
the devices allowed scientists to analyse spatial and temporal relationships between birds and the movement decisions they made at the scale of a fraction of a second			0
' these hierarchies are flexible in the sense that the leading role of any given bird can vary over time , ' said professor @entity112 of the zoology department at @entity73 's @entity114 ' this dynamic , flexible segregation of individuals into leaders and followers - where even the lower - ranking members ' opinions can make a contribution - may represent a particularly efficient form of decision - making			0
' the scientists said more studies could help explain how such a sophisticated leadership system is able to give evolutionary advantage to individuals , compared with strategy based on a single leader or one where all members play an equal part			0
their team published the discovery that homing pigeons are affected by disturbances in the gravity field , in the @entity138			1
at the beginning of the experiment , the team set out to show that gravity anomalies - without geomagnetic contamination - would mislead pigeons			1
to do this , the scientists used a location in the @entity44 - a huge meteorite crater filled with sediment where gravity was weaker than usual			1
the researchers wondered whether crossing the edge of the crater could disrupt a pigeon ’s gyroscope navigation system and send the birds off in the wrong direction			1
pigeon fanciers in the nearby town of @entity160 trained birds and over a series of days , 26 birds fitted with lightweight gps trackers , were released from the middle of the crater			0
of the 18 birds that made it home safely , seven headed in the correct direction and managed to cross the edge of the crater without deviating much from the most direct route home			2
however , other birds that set off in random directions seemed to become disorientated at the edge of the crater and when they crossed a second gravity disturbance , lost their bearings again			2
the researchers compared the flight paths of the birds that encountered the gravity distortions with birds that had an unhindered return home			0
they found that the disturbed birds ’ routes were much more widely dispersed than the unhindered groups and showed that the birds veered off most severely when they crossed the edge of the meteorite impact			0
the scientists believe that the birds initially set a bearing home by comparing their ‘ home gyroscope setting ’ with their ‘ local gyroscope reading ’			1
but some birds initially set the wrong bearing - taking several days to correct the error and return home – suggesting that they rarely use the alternative navigation strategy of regularly checking the difference between their actual and anticipated return routes			1
dr @entity22 hopes to learn more about the cellular mechanisms that allow the birds to detect the weak gravitational forces that keep them on the straight and narrow			0
scientists used a location in the @entity44 - a huge meteorite crater filled with sediment where gravity was weaker than usual - near the town of novoukrainka.the researchers wondered whether crossing the edge of the crater could disrupt a pigeon ’s gyroscope navigation system and send the birds off in the wrong direction a previous study showed that huge flocks of pigeons ( pictured ) decide when to change direction in mid flight by using a kind of ' democratic hierarchy '			1

scientists conducted an experiment over a crater in the @entity44 with *unusual* gravity , to study the navigational systems of homing pigeons
study proved that gravity anomalies can disrupt pigeons ' gyroscope navigation systems and send them in the wrong direction
experts believe birds first set a bearing home by comparing their ‘ home gyroscope setting ’ with their ‘ local gyroscope reading ’
how the birds find their way home was previously a mystery
