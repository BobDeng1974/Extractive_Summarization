with phone handsets constantly evolving and the need for connectivity increasing , it can be difficult to make an informed decision as to which mobile to choose for your lifestyle			0
phone handsets can also be expensive , both to buy outright , or over a provider 's phone plan , which might be convenient , but could see you forking out more than the retail price			0
with the 5.5 inch @entity14 apple iphone 6 retailing from $ 999 and the 5.1 inch @entity16 @entity18 retailing from $ 778 , it comes as a surprise that a new handset is breaking into the smartphone market retailing for only $ 99			1
the @entity23 is targeted at a younger demographic who are conscious of finances but want the best possible phone on which to take photos and engage on social media			2
' however , consumers are fed up of being charged significantly more to purchase them than in other countries			0
we want to offer people a top spec phone , perfect for social media sharing , at an affordable price , ' mr @entity46 said			2
@entity36 spoke to @entity52 , editor of @entity53 , to see how the @entity54 stacked up against it 's @entity56 and @entity57 counterparts			0
‘ @entity58 love smartphones , usage figures are amongst the highest in the world per capita and we spend around 2 hours on them each day , ' said @entity46 , chief marketing officer of @entity34 ' the @entity63 and @entity57 products are far more expensive because they have brighter , larger and much higher resolution screens along with processors that are twice as fast and superior cameras plus they offer top shelf features like fingerprint recognition and productivity features like multitasking , ' @entity52 said ' comparing the $ 99 @entity72 phone to the @entity63 and @entity57 is like comparing a @entity73 to a @entity74 - they both do kind of the same thing but the @entity74 has a much nicer design , is faster , sleeker and all the bells and whistles , ' @entity52 said			1
the tech expert said that the @entity54 has lower specifications than the @entity63 and @entity83 , with @entity84 of internal storage , 5 megapixel camera , a 5 - inch screen with a resolution of 854 x 480 and a @entity90 quad core processor			1
' these customers ca n’t afford the @entity63 or top - of - the - line @entity92 , as usually younger users who are buying their first smartphone			0
however , the phone still offers value to pre-paid customers , ' @entity52 said			2
the @entity34 is available on the @entity98 with @entity23 ’s $ 40 unlimited monthly offer , and most phone networks offer bring - your - own handset deals			0
@entity98 offers a @entity104 $ 45 per month for other handsets , @entity103 offers a comparable $ 35 @entity104 plan , and @entity107 offers a $ 30 @entity104 plan			0
' comparing the $ 99 @entity72 phone to the @entity63 and @entity57 is like comparing a @entity73 to a @entity74 - they both do kind of the same thing but the @entity74 has a much nicer design , is faster , sleeker and all the bells and whistles , ' said @entity52 ' the @entity63 and @entity57 products are far more expensive because they have brighter , larger and much higher resolution screens along with processors that are twice as fast and superior cameras ( @entity63 6 has an eight megapixel - and @entity18 has a 16 megapixel camera ) plus they offer top shelf features like fingerprint recognition and productivity features like multitasking			1
in the case of the @entity18 it is also waterproof ! ' @entity52 said			0
these pointers do n't mean that the $ 99 smartphone is n't great value , however			1
@entity52 labelled the @entity54 ' excellent value ' , as it still offers the experience most users are looking for , as they can enjoy content on the go on the larger 5 - inch screen , connect to social media and take pictures with the built - in camera			1
' no it ’s not an @entity63 or @entity57 phone but the @entity34 $ 99 phone still punches well above its weight , ' @entity52 determined .			1

boost @entity141 have *launched* the first $ 99 smartphone aimed at young social media users
@entity58 social media use is among the highest in the world , spending almost two hours a day on social media sites
with the 5.5 inch @entity14 iphone 6 retailing from $ 999 and the 5.1 inch @entity152 retailing from $ 778 , the less expensive phone is much *cheaper* but has much lower specifications than the high - end handsets
