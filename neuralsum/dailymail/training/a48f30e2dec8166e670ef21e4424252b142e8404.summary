the @entity12 home was spray painted with the words ' do the right thing , ' a reference to ' @entity17 , ' a 1989 movie directed by @entity5 - a neighboring home was also hit by the vandals the vandalism appears to have been in response to a tuesday night rant that came when @entity5 was asked to argue against the development of poorer neighborhoods in @entity12 and @entity26			1
the director also blasted an audience member at the @entity30 panel discussion who started defending the changes in the neighborhoods			1
' do the right thing ' : vandals tagged a brownstone owned by @entity5 's father response : the graffiti is believed to be part of a backlash against @entity5 's controversial comments only days earlier @entity47 was shattered at the neighboring home and the words ' do the right , ' a reference to the title of a @entity5 - directed 1989 movie about racial tensions dividing @entity12 , were spray painted on both brownstones , @entity42 reported			1
' all i know is that he made a lot of comments that went viral , the next day my house is vandalized , ' @entity53 told @entity42			0
' there is probably some kind of connection in the mind of whoever did this ... there is no reasonable reason for it			0

his soapbox : @entity5 argued that @entity10 is being gentrified at an alarming rate and it is no longer the same city that he grew up in the vitriol is believed to have been a response to @entity5 not only railing against @entity12 's rapid gentrification , even in traditionally poverty - stricken and minority - dominated neighborhoods			1
@entity5 even personally attacked an audience member defending the rising rents and quickly changing demographics , an outburst @entity5 did not take kindly to			2
' let me just kill you right now , ' @entity5 shouted at the unidentified spectator			2
' have you seen @entity103 in the morning ? it ’s like the mother * * * * g ’ @entity106 , ' he said , drawing a comparison to the high - brow competition that would seem out of place in the harder - edged streets of @entity12 where he grew up			1
@entity5 pointed the finger at white @entity10 who have moved into historically black neighborhoods and changed the environment , arguing that those changes have caused the areas to evolve into something completely different			2
' here ’s the thing : i grew up here in @entity103			2
i grew up here in @entity10			0
and why does it take an influx of white @entity10 in the south @entity127 , in @entity26 , in @entity128 , in @entity129 for the facilities to get better ? ' he continued			0
' the garbage was n’t picked up every mother * * * * g ’ day when i was living in 165 @entity103			1

' when you see white mothers pushing their babies in strollers , three o’clock in the morning on @entity137 , that must tell you something			0
' protecting a legacy : @entity5 complained that residents in @entity12 and @entity26 are now stopping events in public parks for fear of excessive noise of garbage ' @entity151 ' : @entity5 said that a scene in his 1989 hit @entity17 foreshadowed gentrification problems to come in @entity26 the 10 - minute exchange was transcribed by @entity155 , and it was clear that he knew it would cause a firestorm			1
' my father ’s a great jazz musician			2
he bought a house in nineteen - motherf * * * * g ’ - sixty - eight , and the motherf * * * * g ' people moved in last year and called the cops on my father			1

' in spite of his outrage , @entity5 has on the tony @entity215 since 2000			1
he keeps connected to his @entity12 roots by basing his company 's headquarters in @entity103			1
the topic was raised when a male audience member asked about a recent @entity222 article that extolled the benefits of gentrification			2
this was not the paper 's first recent foray into the issue , as a series they ran about homelessness in the city pointed out that some of the worst - run shelters is located next to brownstone houses that now sell for multiple millions			1
@entity5 said that gentrification is shown by more than just a heavier police presence on the streets but also by the dismissal of cultural customs			1
' then comes the mother * * * * g ’ @entity243			1
you ca n’t discover this ! we been here			0
