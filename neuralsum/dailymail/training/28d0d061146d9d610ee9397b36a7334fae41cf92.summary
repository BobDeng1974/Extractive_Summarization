@entity0 are bracing themselves for a battle with the @entity2 as they look to seal a move for @entity4			1
the @entity5 were on wednesday close to agreeing a deal with @entity7 for the central defender , who has a £ 15million release clause			1
but the biggest stumbling block towards a deal will be securing the @entity14 a work permit			2
@entity15 's @entity4 ( right ) could be heading for @entity0 if they can secure a work permit @entity17 ( left ) fights for the ball with @entity20 ace @entity19 during a @entity22 group game the 24 - year - old has not played a senior match for his country , and hence will have great difficulty in obtaining a work permit			1
however , @entity0 are set to appeal any such decision in their attempts to land @entity17 this month			0
should the @entity31 , who rule on behalf of the @entity2 in such cases , refuse to grant the defender the necessary paperwork to play in the @entity36 , the @entity5 will then have to prove @entity17 is an ' exceptional talent ' in their bid to land him a permit			0
this will be easier said than done , however , given the @entity17 has not played for @entity42			0
rules state that only players who have played 75 percent of matches for a nation inside @entity47 's top 70 within the past two years are eligible for work permits			0
defender @entity17 is yet to make a senior appearance for the @entity14 national side @entity52 ( centre ) was allowed to join @entity54 despite having only played four times for @entity56 @entity0 's attempts to secure the green light for @entity17 to play in this country will make interesting viewing for the club 's rivals			1
seemingly , given the @entity64 falls short of meeting the @entity2 's criteria , other clubs would have reason to be perplexed should @entity17 be granted permission to play in the @entity68			0
however , the @entity5 could use @entity54 's recent signing of @entity52 as precedent in an appeal process			2
there were major doubts over @entity54 's capture of @entity52 earlier this month given he has just four caps for @entity56 to his name			1
but the @entity78 successfully argued to the @entity31 that @entity52 was of ' exceptional talent ' and eventually saw @entity81 chiefs endorse their application .			0

@entity0 close to agreeing £ 15million deal for @entity7 defender
@entity4 has not played a senior match for @entity42 - *meaning* obtaining a work permit could prove difficult
