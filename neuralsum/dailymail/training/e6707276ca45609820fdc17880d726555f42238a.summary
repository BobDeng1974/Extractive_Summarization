experts are investigating whether a spate of whale and dolphin deaths along @entity5 's west coast may be linked to the hunt for a @entity8 submarine			1
whale and @entity10 has asked the @entity11 to detail what military movements took place off the @entity16 and @entity17 coasts in december when a naval chase took place , with sinister echoes of @entity22 - era submarine movies such as @entity23			1
@entity25 planes aided the the hunt , which was sparked when a periscope was spotted in waters off @entity29 where @entity31 submarines normally surface as they head in or out of the base , home to @entity35 's nuclear deterrent			1
@entity53 at @entity29 , home to @entity35 's nuclear deterrent			1
a periscope spotted nearby sparked the hunt two @entity58 aircraft were drafted in to carry out patrols in the @entity60 amid fears a @entity8 submarine was lurking off the coast			1
but since the search experts have been baffled by an increasing spate of mystery deaths around the west coast of @entity5 , including several by the world 's deepest diving mammal			2
scientists at the @entity71 and @entity72 ( @entity73 ) say they have now received 15 reports since mid-december of stranded @entity38 's beaked whales , a species that is rarely seen due to its offshore distribution			1
the noise pollution caused by activities like the naval hunt can disrupt the behavioural patterns of whales and dolphins , driving them away from their regular haunts and potentially causing strandings and death			2
the strandings have occurred down the west coast between @entity5 and @entity17 including two on @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52			1
in addition other species of whale and dolphin have washed ashore along the west coast , including a killer whale on the @entity97			2
now conservationists want to know if sonar in particular - which can damage cetaceans and has been suspected in past strandings - was used in the submarine hunt			2
dr @entity103 , head of the @entity104 , said he was still waiting for the @entity11 's response			2
he said : ' @entity106 has asked the @entity11 for answers , which will be passed on to me			0
they want to know what military activity was taking place in the area at the time			0
the recent naval hunt has echoes of the @entity22 classic ' it is possible that these strandings are linked to certain military activity			0
it is something we are looking at			0
' but the animals were so badly decomposed we shall probably never know the answer			0
' samples from some of the dead @entity38 's have been sent to dr @entity103 for analysis			2
dr @entity130 , sightings and strandings officer for @entity73 , added : ' what we do know is that there has been a large and sudden cluster event			0
' it may be biological or it may be man made			0
we are concerned because we have not known anything like this for the last six to eight years			0
' we do not know why and we may never know , especially given the state of the animals			0
' @entity38 's whales can grow up to 23 feet and are widely distributed in tropical to cool temperate waters			1
@entity5 represents their northern-most limit			0
the species is the current world - record holder for the longest and deepest dive for a mammal - down to 2992 metres for a staggering two hours and 17 minutes			1
the pressure at this depth is 300kg per square centimetre			0
other than the pair of teeth in adult males , beaked whales are toothless and are thought to use suction to catch their prey			2
dr @entity130 of the @entity160 and @entity72 has voiced his concern about the strandings in a statement on its website , @entity106 said : ' the mass stranding of rare , deep - diving whales along the coast of @entity17 last december could be linked to a reported search by @entity35 navy warships for a suspected @entity8 submarine			1
' eight rarely sighted @entity38 's beaked whales have been found off the @entity17 coast in recent weeks together with a number of common dolphins , a minke whale , a sperm whale , pilot whales , a fin whale , and harbour porpoises			1
' the total of 33 whales and dolphins washed up dead on @entity17 shores so far this year is a record			0
' last year a number of @entity38 's beaked whale deaths in @entity187 were thought to be due to military exercises in the area			1
' investigations following @entity35 's largest mass dolphin stranding in 2008 concluded that the only realistic cause was military exercises taking place in the area at the time			1
' noise pollution threatens whale and dolphin populations , interrupting their normal behaviour , driving them away from areas important to their survival , and at worst injuring or sometimes even causing their deaths			0
' for whales and dolphins , ' listening ' is as important as ' seeing ' is for humans , yet there are still no international regulations regarding noise pollution in the world 's seas			0

@entity213 chase sparked when periscope was spotted in waters off @entity29
the @entity218 base is home to @entity35 's nuclear armed submarines
whale and @entity10 has asked @entity11 for details of hunt
search may have disrupted whale and dolphin behaviour , leading to 15 reports since mid-december of stranded @entity38 's beaked whales
species is world - record holder for longest and deepest dive by a mammal
strandings reported on @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52
