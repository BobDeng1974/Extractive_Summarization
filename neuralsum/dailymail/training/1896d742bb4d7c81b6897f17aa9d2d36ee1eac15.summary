by @entity1 reporter a natural cooling of the @entity3 is responsible for the slowdown in the pace of global warming so far this century , according to a new study			2
scientists believe a series of naturally occurring @entity11 weather events in the @entity3 in recent years , which bring cooler waters to the surface , have masked the heat - trapping effect caused by greenhouse gases			1
the slowdown has raised hopes among some governments that it will be easier and cheaper to achieve long - term goals for limiting temperature rises to avert more heatwaves , droughts , floods and rising sea levels			0
strong currents in the @entity3 have brought cooler water to the surface , slowing the pace of global warming , scientists believe ' our results show that the current hiatus is part of natural climate variability , tied specifically to a @entity11 - like decadal cooling , ' according to the study by @entity36 and @entity37 at the @entity38			1
' although similar decadal hiatus events may occur in the future , the multi-decadal warming trend is very likely to continue with greenhouse gas increase , ' they wrote in the journal @entity45			1
past studies have linked the slowdown in the pace of warming this century to factors such as a build - up of sun - dimming air pollution in the atmosphere or a decline in the sun 's output			2
others suggest that the deep oceans may be absorbing more heat			0
nine of the 10 warmest years since records began in the mid- 19th century have been since 2000 , with 1998 the exception , according to @entity63 @entity62 ( @entity62 )			1
even so , the pace of warming has slowed from the 1980s and 1990s even though greenhouse gas emissions have hit record highs			1
there have been four years with @entity11 cooling events in the @entity3 since 1998 and only two with the opposite , @entity70 , when the @entity3 waters warm , according to @entity62 data			1
the predominance of @entity74 is unusual			0
the nature study said its computer models , based on a reconstruction of @entity3 temperatures , also successfully accounted for droughts in the @entity80 and winter coolings in northwestern @entity82 this century			0
scientists warn that the effect is only temporary and that the trend of warming is likely to continue a @entity63 panel of scientists , the main authority on global warming , will issue a report on sept. 26 in @entity91			1
drafts show it is likely to raise the probability that human activities are the main cause of climate change to ' extremely likely ' , or a 95 per cent chance			0
that is up from 90 per cent in the last report in 2007			0
its main scenarios also show that temperatures could rise by up to about 5 degrees @entity104 ( 9 degrees @entity105 ) by 2100			0
the drafts devote little space to explaining the hiatus in rising temperatures			0
almost 200 governments have agreed to limit a rise in temperatures to less than 2 degrees @entity104 above levels before the @entity115 - meaning average world surface temperatures should not rise above about 15.6 @entity104			2
temperatures have so far gained by about 0.8 c and many scientists say that warming is already causing more extreme weather , ranging from heatwaves to downpours			1
@entity123 , of the @entity124 in @entity125 , said the new study of the @entity3 was ' compelling evidence ' that warming was being masked by the oceans and that the slowdown was tied to natural cycles			2
other experts noted the study did not fully explain the hiatus , especially where extra the heat trapped by greenhouse gases , led by carbon dioxide , was building up in the system .			0

scientists warn it is temporary and the warming trend is ' likely to continue '
