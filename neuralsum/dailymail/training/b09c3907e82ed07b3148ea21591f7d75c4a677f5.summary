testing on victims has not taken place because of the intensity of the fighting there , but a @entity5 doctor in the town , who was also injured by the strike , says he is ' 75 per cent ' sure it is a chemical weapon			2
there was also speculation it was an unsophisticated warhead containing chlorine , similar to weapons used in the @entity35			2

it is claimed @entity2 fighters fired a crude chemical weapon at the war zone this photo reportedly shows a skin blister caused by the alleged chemical weapon attack swelling : testing on victims has not taken place because of the intensity of the fighting there last week the @entity53 government reported that @entity2 controls a vast compound in @entity53 containing 2,500 rusting chemical weapons rockets			1
the site was bombed by the @entity57 during the @entity58 , but the munitions there were only partially destroyed , according to the @entity61 - then left to @entity53 to take care of			1
however , @entity53 officials wrote to the @entity61 this summer claiming that abandoned weapons containing the lethal nerve agent @entity66 are still in the ruins of the @entity68 , which made chemical weapons in the 1980s and early 1990s , and that this is now in the hands of the violent jihadists			1

@entity53 's @entity61 ambassador @entity120 wrote to the @entity61 saying that ' armed terrorist groups ' took over the @entity123 complex , which lies 60 miles north of @entity110 , on june 11			1
in a letter to @entity61 @entity126 ban ki - moon , ambassador @entity120 said remnants of a former chemical weapons programme are kept in two bunkers there			1
' the project management spotted at dawn on thursday , 12 june 2014 , through the camera surveillance system , the looting of some of the project equipment and appliances , before the terrorists disabled the surveillance system , ' @entity120 wrote in the letter dated june 30			0
' @entity140 requests the @entity141 to understand the current inability of @entity53 , owing to the deterioration of the security situation , to fulfill its obligations to destroy chemical weapons , ' he said			1
the @entity123 complex measures three by three miles and was thought to be capable of producing around 4,000 tonnes of nerve agent a year			0
secrets : in 2002 president @entity149 said @entity150 was developing a program of chemical weapons but no evidence of such weapons was ever found @entity120 singled out the capture of bunkers 13 and 41 in the sprawling complex 35 miles ( 56 kilometers ) northwest of @entity110 in the notorious ' @entity157			1
' the last major report by @entity61 inspectors on the status of @entity53 's weapons of mass destruction program was released about a year after the experts left in march 2003			1
it states that @entity164 contained 2,500 sarin - filled 122 - mm chemical rockets produced and filled before 1991 , and about 180 tons of sodium cyanide , ' a very toxic chemical and a precursor for the warfare agent tabun			0
' however , @entity57 @entity171 spokesman rear admiral @entity170 said earlier that the @entity57 ' best understanding was that ' whatever material was kept there is pretty old and not likely to be able to be accessed or used against anyone right now '			0
' we are n't viewing this particular site and their holding it as a major issue at this point , ' @entity170 said			0
' should they even be able to access the materials , frankly , it would likely be more of a threat to them than anyone else			0
' it was revealed this week that about 5,000 chemical weapons were recovered or destroyed in @entity53 following the 2003 invasion but the @entity190 chose to keep the findings top secret			1
an investigation by @entity116 has revealed that @entity57 forces happened across the hidden caches of warheads , shells and aviation bombs between 2004 and 2011			0
but the information was n't made public for several embarrassing reasons including the fact some of the weapons were @entity57 - made , plus they had been sitting dormant since the early 1980s and therefore did n't support president @entity149 's rationale for going to war			2
the weapons - most of them mustard agents in 155 - millimeter artillery shells or 122 - millimeter rockets - were developed by @entity150 during the @entity205 which raged between 1980 and 1988			2
but on september 12 , 2002 , president @entity149 had contended that @entity150 was developing new chemical weapons capable of ' mass destruction '			1
' right now , @entity53 is expanding and improving facilities that were used for the production of biological weapons , ' he said			2
but all the weapons found had been developed before 1991			0
in march 2003 , president @entity149 received a mandate from the @entity218 to lead an invasion of @entity53 , asserting that @entity53 was in violation of @entity221			2
with strong support from @entity225 p.m. @entity224 , the @entity149 administration claimed that @entity150 and his forces were in possession of weapons of mass destruction that posed a threat to @entity57 security and that of allies including the @entity225 and @entity233			0
after investigation following the invasion , the @entity57 led @entity236 concluded that @entity53 had ended its nuclear , chemical and biological programs in 1991 and had no active programs at the time of the invasion , but that they intended to resume production if the @entity53 sanctions were lifted			2
although no active chemical weapons program was found , at least 17 @entity57 troops and 7 @entity53 police officers were burned or wounded when chemical devices exploded			1
president @entity149 later said that the biggest regret of his presidency was ' the intelligence failure ' in @entity53 , while the @entity252 found in 2008 that his administration ' misrepresented the intelligence and the threat from @entity53 '			0
the @entity57 completed its withdrawal of military personnel in december 2011 , during the ninth year of the war			0
the rise of @entity2 means that the @entity57 will send an army headquarters to @entity53 for the first time in three years to assist local security forces struggling to resist advances by the fundamentalist group			1
another reason for the cover - up , according to @entity265 , was that five of the six chemical weapons encounters involved weapons designed by the @entity57 '' ' nothing of significance '' is what i was ordered to say , ' said @entity274 , a now - retired @entity276 major who was present when forces found 2,400 nerve agent rockets in 2006 - the largest chemical weapons discovery of the war			1
soldiers were also loathe to report finding the caches as documenting chemical weapons added hours of extra work to their load			1
chemical warfare specialists had to be called in , and waiting for them to arrive put coalition forces in dangerous positions			0
' i could wait all day for tech escort to show up and make a chem round disappear , or i could just make it disappear myself , ' one ex-soldier told @entity265			0
the mustard shells could be put in with other explosives that needed to be destructed and then detonated			0
@entity57 secretary of state @entity296 visits the former @entity298 crossing point @entity299 in @entity298 today however , handling chemical weapons lead to many injuries , which were not taken seriously by military doctors at the time			2
many explosive ordnance disposal personnel were not aware that the shells they were handling contained chemicals , believing them to be regular old artillery			0
at least 17 @entity57 military personnel and seven @entity53 police were sickened by poisons - usually sarin and mustard gases			0
many of the shells would leak liquid during transportation , exposing the soldiers to the potentially - lethal fumes			0
symptoms ranged from disorientation and nausea to blindness and huge , seething blisters			0
@entity325 , a former @entity276 sergeant on hand for the destruction of mustard shells that burned two soldiers in his infantry company , joked of ' wounds that never happened ' from ' that stuff that did n't exist '			0
' i love it when i hear , '' oh there were n't any chemical weapons in @entity53 '' , ' he said			1
