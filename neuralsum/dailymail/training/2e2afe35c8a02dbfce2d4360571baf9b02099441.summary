the pastel - coloured orchid mantis has fascinated naturalists for more than a century			1
it was popularly thought that the insect , whose legs are flattened and heart - shaped to resemble petals , simply mimics an orchid , allowing it to ' hide ' and catch prey			1
but it 's only now that scientists suggested that the mantis does n’t simply blend into flowers , but is attractive to insects in its own right , sometimes preferring to remain more easily visible on leaves			1
@entity37 mimicry by predators is well known			0
for example , crab spiders camouflage themselves against a flower and can change from yellow to white to match their host flower			0
while the orchid mantis does seem to fit into this category , there was no evidence to support the hypothesis			1
orchid mantises are rare in their native @entity50 and @entity51 , so their behaviour is hardly known about , except in captivity			1
for example , nobody knows exactly which flower the mantis is supposed to mimic , dr @entity58 , an insect evolutionary ecology expert at the @entity59 wrote			2
when paired alongside the most common flower in their habitat , insects approached mantises more often than flowers , showing that mantises are attractive to insects by themselves , rather than simply camouflaging among the flora , the study revealed			2
here , an orchid mantis eats a @entity72 heliconian butterfly in @entity50 the rare orchid mantis is native to rainforests in @entity75			1
its four walking legs resemble flower petals			0
the insect has evolved to mimic a generic flower , rather than an orchid			1
the toothed front pair are used to grasp prey			0
however , it does n't ' hide ' in similarly coloured flowers , but can attract insects in its own right			1
their bright colouring is thought to appeal to its prey			0
the compact brains of insects use a rule of thumb - anything matching colour x is a nectar - containing flower – and the predator uses ‘ sensory exploitation ’ to catch its victims			1
orchid mantises show some of the most pronounced sexual dimorphism of any species of mantis , with males less than half the size of females			2
now a set of new studies shows that while the mantis does indeed look like a flower , it does n’t hide in an orchid			1
in fact , it does n’t hide at all and does n’t look particularly like an orchid to insects			2
dr @entity115 of @entity116 , @entity117 , set about systematically testing the ideas contained within the traditional view of the orchid mantis ' modus operandi			1
first , they tested whether mantises actually camouflage amongst flowers , or , alternatively , attract insects on their own			0
for a flower - seeking insect , as predicted , the mantis ' colour pattern is indistinguishable from most common flowers			1
however , when paired alongside the most common flower in their habitat , insects approached mantises more often than flowers , showing that mantises are attractive to insects by themselves , rather than simply camouflaging among the flora			2
‘ we can clearly observe insects , like bees , diverging from their flight paths and flying right towards this deceptive predator , ’ dr @entity133 said			0
orchid mantises are actually very rare in the field , so their behaviour is hardly known about , except in captivity			0
for example , nobody knows exactly which flower the mantis is supposed to mimic			0
this stock image shows a pale yellow orchid mantis , ready to strike ‘ these beasties are marvellous for this kind of question , because we can observe a dynamic interaction between predators and prey			1
’ this phenomenon , known as aggressive mimicry , occurs in other animals			0
for example , the bolas spider releases chemicals that imitate sex pheromones released by female moths seeking a mate			0
the orchid mantis uses aggressive mimicry to attract dinner			2
the bolas spider ( stock image ) uses this technique to release chemicals that imitate sex pheromones released by female moths seeking a mate			0
male moths , can detect these pheromones from miles away and are lured in to their death male moths , with their elaborately plumed antennae , can detect these pheromones from miles away , and are lured in to their death			0
carnivorous @entity181 firefly females can mimic the flash - responses of a different species of firefly , attracting amorous males who find themselves on the menu			0
next the researchers assessed where mantises chose to sit			0
surprisingly mantises did not choose to hide among the flowers and selected leaves just as often			2
sitting near flowers did bring benefits , though , because insects were attracted to the general vicinity			0
when they compared the mantis ’s shape and colour with flowers from an insect ’s perspective , the predator did not resemble an orchid or indeed any particular species of flower , but rather a ‘ generalised ’ flower			1
@entity181 fireflies ( @entity210 image shown ) can mimic the flash - responses of a different species of firefly , attracting amorous males to their deaths			0
this fits with what scientists already know : that some of the best mimics in nature are imperfect mimics with characteristics of several ‘ model ’ species			0
placing experimental plastic models out in the field , the researchers found that mantis colour was much more important than shape in attracting insects			2
they believe that mantises may not actually precisely mimic a particular kind of flower			0
instead they may exploit a loophole created by evolutionary efficiency savings within the insect brain			0
the compact brains of insects use a rule of thumb - anything matching colour x is a nectar - containing flower – and the predator uses ‘ sensory exploitation ’ to catch its victims			1
sensory exploitation is a concentrated mass of the right colour			1
the insect classifies the mantis as a giant nectar - filled flower and approaches to investigate – to its doom			1
the white crab spider also lures prey using sensory exploitation			2
it reflects strongly in uv light , making it highly conspicuous to wandering insects			0
a flower with a crab spider is more attractive than one without , because the crab spider mimics uv - reflective floral patterns that guide insects to nectar			2
but the orchid mantis is the first animal ever shown to mimic an entire flower , attracting insects on its own			1
the findings have left experts questioning why the orchid mantis ’ body parts resemble petals , if it can attract insects with its colour alone			1
commenting on the research , @entity275 , an expert on animal deception and mimicry at of @entity278 , said : ‘ my guess is that the pollinators are initially attracted at a distance through sensory exploitation , but then more accurate mimicry kicks in at close range , when the insects can inspect the mantis more closely for what it is			1

the orchid mantis is native to @entity50 and @entity51 , but it 's rare
@entity292 evolved a flower - like appearance , instead of mimicking an orchid
insect does n't hide in flowers and likes to sit on *contrasting* leaves
scientists saw insects being drawn towards the *uncamouflaged* predator
mantis attracts insects because of its colour using ' sensory exploitation '
victims *automatically* link colour with nectar - filled flowers
