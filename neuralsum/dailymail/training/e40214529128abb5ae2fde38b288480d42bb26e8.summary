@entity1 has become like @entity2 - he 's got nothing left			1
and when the long - serving @entity4 lost the lot - business , home and self respect - he went a bit crazy			0
@entity9 @entity1 might as well jump on a tube to @entity11 and go looking for @entity13 's shoulder to cry on			2
in fact , @entity14 is probably more the @entity9 's level tactically			0
@entity18 games are great entertainment for the neutral and my work is taking me to four in the next month - i ca n't wait to see a load of their players ambling back from the opposition half while three or four opponents surge towards @entity28 's goal			1
big @entity29 trotting back with a cloud coming out of his head that reads : ' everything 's going to be fine , @entity35 is covering for me ! ' @entity18 manager @entity1 looks frustrated during his side 's 2 - 1 defeat by @entity38 makeshift centre back @entity35 ( left ) struggled to deal with the pace and trickery of @entity42 @entity43 charcater @entity2 has been having a tough time , just like @entity45 boss @entity1 this season @entity46 caught in a time warp , thinking he has the legs of a 21 - year - old as he loiters around the edge of the opposition penalty area while @entity28 is overwhelmed at the other end of the field			1
@entity54 looks desperate to go back to his attacking ways , which is understandable			0
that 's why @entity18 signed him			2
there was talk of how the @entity38 game would have been over by half - time had @entity18 been more clinical			1
these people must have missed the @entity63 performance			0
tactically @entity18 are a joke			2
a very funny one , too			0
to make it worse , @entity1 revealed recently that he tried – and failed – to sign both @entity66 and @entity67			2
quite how that conversation with @entity67 went is open to speculation			0
wenger : ' @entity67 , do you want to come to @entity18 ? ' @entity67 : ' no thanks			2
' @entity2 ( right ) , played by @entity73 , enjoys happier times with @entity75 at the @entity78 @entity77 pub @entity38 striker @entity79 ( right ) puts his side 2 - 0 up against the @entity45 on saturday evening @entity1 has revealed how he tried to sign @entity67 when the @entity82 superstar was a teenager @entity83 and @entity84 appear dejected after the final whistle at the @entity86 but imagine the team that @entity1 ' nearly ' bought			1
it includes @entity89 , @entity66 , @entity67 and @entity90			0
he 's not helping himself by talking about players he possibly could have signed but did n't			0
credit to @entity1 though , for signing @entity94			1
he has been a joy to watch this season			0
but when you step back for a second , you should be asking whether that was an area of the team where they needed to spend £ 30million			1
this is why i question that signing			0
if you 're asking whether @entity1 signed a quality player in @entity94 , then the answer is obviously yes			1
if you put the question into context , then it becomes a debate			0
was signing a player like @entity113 's priority in the summer ? no , of course not			0
it was clear even last season that @entity18 needed a centre - half and a defensive midfielder to make them genuine contenders for the @entity120 and the @entity121			1
@entity1 's and his men face a tough @entity121 clash against @entity124 on wednesday @entity94 ( left ) , pictured moving away from @entity125 , had a quiet game against @entity38 take @entity94 away from the side and @entity18 would be even worse of course			1
but take him away and replace him with a centre - half and a defensive midfielder bought with that money , and they might be doing a lot better than they are now			0
the proof is in the results and performances so far this season			0
@entity1 should have signed the players the team needed , and if he got @entity94 on top of that then @entity18 could have been brilliant this season			1
so many high quality defensive midfielders have been bought and sold since @entity18 last had a decent one – that was @entity143 who left in 2008			2
and worryingly for @entity45 fans , @entity1 spoke last week about giving @entity145 a new contract			2
do n't misunderstand me , i have every sympathy for injured players			0
but @entity145 is not the answer to @entity18 's problems			2
@entity1 has admitted that he could offer @entity145 a new contract despite the midfielder 's injury problems @entity157 midfielder @entity156 ( second from left ) could 've been an option for the @entity45 have a look at every other @entity120 club			1
could it be argued that they all have better options in defensive midfield positions than @entity18 ? neither @entity54 nor @entity46 do the job properly , so would , for example , @entity166 or @entity167 at bottom - of - the - table @entity168 be better ? i 'm not saying @entity1 should sign those two , but it 's not ridiculous to suggest they are both better at holding in midfield than the @entity18 pair			1
some might say the players @entity18 need are hard to find			0
but a man of @entity1 's experience should know that the likes of @entity156 and @entity180 are the missing pieces			1
can @entity1 persuade them to come to the @entity86 ? he 's not worth his £ 8million - a - year salary if he ca n't .			1

@entity18 were *embarrassed* by @entity38 at the @entity86
@entity1 's poor tactics were exposed during the @entity45 ' 2 - 1 loss
@entity94 has been *excellent* but @entity18 need defensive signings
@entity1 should 've put £ 30million towards @entity156 and @entity180
