but he has been stung by new rules aimed at preventing @entity19 migrants from taking advantage of the benefits system			0
when mr @entity4 , of @entity22 , @entity23 , returned from the internship he applied for @entity25 but was told he was not entitled to it			1
an official said in a letter : ' this is because we have decided that for benefit purposes only you ’re not considered to be habitually resident in the @entity10			1
' the letter went on to say that as an ‘ @entity41 national ’ , his right to reside as a job seeker would be limited to six months unless he could provide evidence he was continuing to seek work and had a genuine chance of work			0
mr @entity4 said he was shocked by the letter and had appealed , but had heard nothing yet			2
he said : ' i could n’t believe it			0
i went to @entity13 thinking it would eventually help me find work back in the @entity10 but now i seem to have been penalised for doing this			1
' fortunately , i live at home with my mother and she will ensure i can eat and get by , but what would i be meant to do if i was living on my own ? ' the @entity54 film - making graduate worked in the @entity56 capital for the @entity57 , which is funded by the @entity58			0
mr @entity4 has been stung by new rules aimed at preventing @entity19 migrants from taking advantage of the benefits system it aims to give participants an understanding of sustainability - related projects while also developing their employability skills and helping them gain experience abroad			1
mr @entity4 said he wondered whether he had been caught up in a new @entity70 drive to prevent @entity19 migrants coming to the @entity10 and immediately claiming benefits			1
this was confirmed by the @entity74			0
a spokesman said it was ' absolutely right ' that strict rules were in place to protect the @entity10 benefits system and make sure that it was not abused			1
in the letter , an official told mr @entity4 : ' this is because we have decided that for benefit purposes only you 're not considered to be habitually resident in the @entity10 ' ' as has always been the case , anyone who chooses to live in another country for a long period of time and so is n’t contributing in @entity10 must , if they return to the @entity10 and want to claim benefits , prove that they have strong ties to this country in order to pass the @entity93 , ' he said			1
' the new rules , which came into force on january 1 , mean that someone has to be living in this country for three months before they can take the @entity93			0
' the rules apply to migrants from all @entity41 countries coming here to look for work , including @entity10 nationals returning to the @entity10 after a period of living abroad			1
' @entity111 mp @entity110 said mr @entity4 ’s case was the second of that nature he had been made aware of			2
he said : ' i have spoken to @entity116 ( minister for the @entity74 ) to warn him that these new regulations will hit as many @entity10 people as foreigners			2
he has said he will look at it , but i have not heard back from him			0
' the government seems more interested in stopping people ’s entitlement to benefits , because that makes unemployment figures look lower , than in trying to operate a fair system that supports people who have paid @entity130 for years , if and when they become unemployed			0
' the new rules , brought into force on january 1 , mean @entity19 migrants now have to wait for at least three months before they can claim any out - of - work benefits			0
previously , @entity19 migrants had been able to start claiming @entity25 and other benefits within weeks of arriving – prompting concern that some people are arriving , signing on and only then looking for work			2
announcing the measures in december , prime minister @entity140 said he understood the concerns of voters worried that incomers should not be allowed to take advantage of @entity10 ’s benefits system and public services			2
other measures announced included cutting off benefits after six months for @entity19 jobseekers with no employment prospect and stopping them from making housing benefit claims			0
the government has also toughened the so - called ‘ habitual residence test ’ to include a minimum earnings threshold , to check whether migrants are in proper employment .			0

@entity4 travelled to @entity13 last year for a four - month internship
he tried to apply for @entity25 upon return but was denied it
