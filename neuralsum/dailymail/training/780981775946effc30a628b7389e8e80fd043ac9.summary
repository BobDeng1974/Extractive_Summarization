it is set to become the largest rocket ever built , dwarfing the rockets that took man to the moon and paving the way for manned missions to @entity7			0
@entity9 's @entity8 ( @entity8 ) will take @entity10 to deep space - and blazed through its first successful test at @entity9 's @entity13 near @entity14 , @entity15			1
the @entity16 , formerly the space shuttle main engine , fired up for 500 seconds on the a- 1 test stand at @entity19 , providing @entity9 engineers critical data on the engine controller unit and inlet pressure conditions			1
the @entity8 system will use four of the giant rockets when it blasts off to deep space there will be two versions of the rocket			1
the smaller , 70 - metric - ton @entity8 will stand 321 feet tall , provide 8.4 million pounds of thrust at liftoff , weigh 5.5 million pounds and carry 154,000 pounds of payload			1
the massive 130 - metric - ton - configuration will be the most capable , powerful launch vehicle in history			2
towering a staggering 384 feet tall , it will provide 9.2 million pounds of thrust at liftoff and weigh 6.5 million pounds			1
it will be able to carry payloads weighing 286,000 pounds to orbit			2
this is the first hot fire of an rs - 25 engine since the end of space shuttle main engine testing in 2009			1
four @entity16 engines will power sls on future missions , including to an asteroid and @entity7			1
scheduled for its initial test flight in 2017 , the @entity8 is designed to be flexible and evolvable to meet a variety of crew and cargo mission needs			1
the initial flight - test configuration will provide a 77 - ton capacity , and the final evolved two - stage configuration will provide a lift capability of more than 143 tons			2
the rocket will be used to ferry astronauts to the @entity63 , and to help us explore the outer reaches of the solar system			0
' the potential use of @entity8 for science will further enhance the synergy between scientific exploration and human exploration , ' said @entity72 , astronaut and associate administrator for science at @entity75 in @entity76			2
' @entity8 has the promise of enabling transformational science in our exploration of the solar system and cosmos			2
' @entity9 has made major modification to the shuttle engines for its new role			2
' we 've made modifications to the @entity16 to meet @entity8 specifications and will analyze and test a variety of conditions during the hot fire series , ' said @entity92 , manager of the @entity93 at @entity9 's @entity94 in @entity95 , @entity96 , where the @entity97 is managed			1
' the engines for @entity8 will encounter colder liquid oxygen temperatures than shuttle ; greater inlet pressure due to the taller core stage liquid oxygen tank and higher vehicle acceleration ; and more nozzle heating due to the four - engine configuration and their position in - plane with the @entity8 booster exhaust nozzles			1
' how big the rocket is : @entity9 's new @entity8 dwarfs the @entity110 in terms of thrust - and the larger version will also dwarf it is size			1
the massive 130 - metric - ton - configuration of the @entity8 will be the most capable , powerful launch vehicle in history			1
testing will resume in april after upgrades are completed on the high pressure industrial water system , which provides cool water for the test facility during a hot fire test			0
eight tests , totaling 3,500 seconds , are planned for the current development engine			0
another development engine later will undergo 10 tests , totaling 4,500 seconds			0
the second test series includes the first test of new flight controllers , known as green running			2
the first flight test of the @entity8 will feature a configuration for a 70 - metric - ton ( 77 - ton ) lift capacity and carry an uncrewed @entity137 spacecraft beyond low - earth orbit to test the performance of the integrated system			1
the first flight test of the @entity8 will feature a configuration for a 70 - metric - ton ( 77 - ton ) lift capacity and carry an uncrewed @entity137 spacecraft beyond low - earth orbit to test the performance of the integrated system			1
as the @entity8 is upgraded , it will provide an unprecedented lift capability of 130 metric tons ( 143 tons ) to enable missions even farther into our solar system			2
@entity9 has signed a $ 2.8 billion contract with @entity150 to build the giant rocket it is hoped will take us into deep space			0
' our teams have dedicated themselves to ensuring that the @entity8 ( @entity8 ) – the largest ever - will be built safely , affordably and on time , ' said @entity155 , @entity8 vice president and program manager			2
' we are passionate about @entity9 's mission to explore deep space			0
' it 's a very personal mission , as well as a national mandate			0
' this milestone marks @entity9 's first cdr on a deep - space human exploration launch vehicle since 1961 , when the @entity110 rocket underwent a similar design review as the @entity10 sought to land an astronaut on the moon			2
how it compares : the sls is larger than the @entity170 rockets than launched man to the @entity172			0
it will also be more powerful than any rocket in operation today			0
@entity176 's super-rocket design has yet to be unveiled			0
however construction of the first stage of @entity176 's super-rocket - capable of lifting 80 tonnes - is already underway currently under construction , @entity9 's @entity8 will be the world 's most powerful launch vehicle			1
designed to enable human exploration missions to deep space destinations , including an asteroid and @entity7 , @entity8 is working toward a first launch in 2017			1
for that first flight test , the rocket will be able to launch 70 metric tons ( 77 tons ) of payload into low - @entity190 orbit , almost three times what the space shuttle could carry			1
from there , @entity8 will be evolved to a configuration that will be able to carry 130 metric tons ( 143 tons ) , more weight than any rocket ever has been able to carry			1
' while many people think of the space launch system in terms of human exploration , @entity8 could have a wide application in a lot of other areas , including space science , ' said @entity205 , assistant program manager for strategy and partnerships for @entity8			2
' for missions to the outer planets , for example , @entity8 could make it possible to do things that are currently impossible , such as sending larger scientific spacecraft with more instruments to far off destinations with reduced transit times			0
' @entity9 's previous rockets , the @entity170 , @entity218 and right , the smaller configuration of the new @entity8 agency scientific and engineering teams have been evaluating whether there would be potential benefits from launching deep space robotic spacecraft , such as the @entity225 , a proposed mission to one of @entity229 's icy moons , on the @entity8 rocket , and determined the rocket would enable the spacecraft to fly direct trajectories to our solar system 's outer planets , rather than using planetary gravities to gain speed , reducing transit time compared to current launch vehicles			1
in the case of the @entity225 , for example , the transit time would be reduced to less than half of what it would be using other launch vehicles			0
' for as long as people have been launching rockets into space , mission designers have had to work within certain limitations – a spacecraft can only be so heavy and it has to fit within a certain width , ' @entity205 said			0
the pieces that make up @entity9 's mega-rocket in its first configuration ' depending on how large you make it , it can only go so fast , which in some cases limits where you can go			0
' today , if you want to send a mission to the outer planets , you have to be able to make it fit within that box			0
with @entity8 , we 're about to make that box much larger			0
' with the space shuttle , for example , we were able to launch missions like @entity9 's @entity273 that were about the size of a school bus			1
' with @entity8 , you can design a spacecraft even larger than the space shuttle that carried @entity273			1
' it 's going to open up an entirely new way of thinking about how we plan and design planetary science missions			0
' ' the space launch system could be really game - changing for space science , ' said @entity285 manager @entity284			0
' for some missions , it makes it much easier and quicker to carry them out			0
' a @entity7 sample return mission , for example , could be flown using only one rocket instead of three			0
' but for other destinations , @entity8 lets you do things we could only dream of before – like collecting samples from the geysers of @entity170 's moon @entity299			0

construction of the @entity8 has already begun
rocket will eventually be 384 feet tall and weigh 6.5 million pounds
will be powered by four @entity16 engines - previously used to send space shuttle into orbit
first test flight scheduled for 2017
will be able to carry 130 tonnes into space
