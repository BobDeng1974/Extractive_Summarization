by @entity0 published : 06:51 est , 17 july 2012 updated : 08:28 est , 17 july 2012 it looks innocent enough			1
an ancient piece of pottery , in pretty good condition aside from a few cracks here and there			2
however , this artefact is causing somewhat of a stink in archeological circles			2
it was assumed this ancient relic was a piece of tableware when it was unearthed at a ruined castle 25 years ago			1
however , it has emerged it is a 17th century stink bomb used to clear rooms during raids			1
for years , experts wrongly - assumed the pot was used to store olive oil			1
but when a picture of it was posted on @entity25 a @entity22 archeologist identified it as a 400 - year - old ' stankpotten ' - a stink bomb			1
causing a stink : the ' bombs ' had fuses attached to the and were often filled with substances such as charcoal , sulphur and pepper seeds which exploded when they smashed with fuses attached to them , these bombs were often filled with substances including charcoal , sulphur and pepper seeds and exploded as they smashed			2
they filled rooms with noxious smells and smoke , clearing them immediately - exactly the same principle used by the @entity46 when they stormed the @entity48 embassy in 1980			2
the bomb - found at @entity50 in @entity51 - dates back to the @entity52 , when @entity55 's @entity54 forces attacked the fortress that was a royalist stronghold			1
@entity59 worker @entity58 uncovered pieces of the relic in 1986 and painstakingly stuck the parts back together to reveal a six inch high , three - handled receptacle			2
it was found outside the outer gatehouse at @entity50 , that was almost completely destroyed during the war			1
some were used as just incendiary weapons and because they were all destroyed when used very few survived			2
from tableware to warfare : the bomb - found at @entity50 in @entity51 ( pictured ) - dates back to the @entity52 , when @entity55 's @entity54 forces attacked the fortress that was a royalist stronghold this is the only one known of this design found in the @entity77 , although spherical metal versions that look like cartoon bombs have been discovered			1
earlier this year the @entity59 found funds to send some of its finds for identification and the stink bomb was sent to @entity84 at @entity85			2
she is a member of the @entity87 and posted a picture of the artefact on the group 's facebook page			1
miss @entity58 , who still works for the @entity59 , said : ' i found it in 1986			2
i stuck it back together and thought it was tableware for storing oil or something			1
' experts at the time said it was n't @entity101 and had been imported but we did n't know any more than that			1
' then earlier this year we sent it off to @entity85 for a finds report			2
some were used as just incendiary weapons but very few survived because they were destroyed once they were launched @entity108 from the @entity59 carefully holds the 400 - year - old stink bomb - a cunning 17th century civil war weapon ' when i got their email i was so excited to find out what it was after all these years			1
' it was found to be a weapon that would have contained any number of contents that could catch fire or cause smelly smoke to be emitted			0
' it had three fuses attached to the three handles and it would have been thrown			0
' i found it outside the guard room where the men who were in charge of the main gate of the castle would have worked			0
' as all the pieces were in the same spot and it is clear this was never used , which was lucky really			0
' @entity135 said : ' this was very exciting and the first one i have ever seen			0
' when i got it i put it on the @entity25 page of the @entity87			1
' we have a lot of members and it is used for discussion and where people help each other identify sherds and vessels			0
and i received details of what it was			0
' it is likely that this was imported , and possibly of @entity22 origin			1
they were either used as incendiary devices or as , literally , stink bombs			0
ancient form of attack : experts thought the ' stankpotten ' had been used to store olive oil ... but its real purpose was far more cunning ' they would have either been thrown into a room to clear it , or from a castle towards those trying to take it			1
' the idea was to create noxious , smoky substance that would have cleared an area			0
' research has shown that they would fill these things with anything including charcoal , pepper seeds , sulphur and pitch			0
' the fuses would have been lit and it would have exploded on impact			0
' it would have been used in the same way that professionals today clear buildings with stun grenades and shows that things have n't changed all that much			0
' the object will be on display at @entity50 from july 22 to july 29			0
@entity50 was built by @entity189 and was bought sir @entity190 in 1635			0
during the @entity52 his wife , lady @entity191 , led the defence of the castle when it was twice besieged by @entity54 forces			0
the first siege , in 1643 , was unsuccessful , but by 1645 @entity196 was one of the last remaining royalist strongholds in southern @entity101 and fell to a siege ending in an assault			0
in march that year @entity50 was demolished on @entity201 's orders			1
@entity50 took over its running in the 1980s .			0

experts *believed* for 25 years the pot was used to store olive oil
it 's real purpose was revealed when a picture of it was posted on @entity25
@entity22 archeologist reveals it is a 17th century civil war ' stankpotten '
