by @entity0 last updated at 1:24 am on 25th february 2012 a fourth inquest has been opened into the most notorious and bitterly controversial legal drama in @entity4 's history : the 1980 death of a nine - week - old baby whose parents say was taken by a dingo from her tent in the @entity10			1
@entity12 's mother , @entity11 , was convicted and later cleared of murdering her and has always maintained that a wild dog took the baby			1
she and her ex-husband , @entity15 , are hoping fresh evidence they have gathered about dingo attacks on children will convince @entity21 coroner @entity20 to end the relentless speculation that has followed them for 32 years			1
determined : @entity12 's mother , @entity11 , arrived at the first day of the inquest today			1
she was convicted and later cleared of murdering her and has always maintained that a wild dog took the baby in 1980 clear their names : she went to the court with her husband @entity30			0
both her and her ex-husband , @entity15 ( not pictured ) are hoping fresh evidence will convince @entity21 coroner @entity20 to end the relentless 32 - year speculation mother and daughter : the @entity35 say they want to set the record straight on behalf of their daughter @entity40 's death certificate still lists her cause of death as unknown ' , which continues to fuel speculation over her parents ' involvement			1
@entity48 , a former police officer hired by the court to investigate the case , told a packed courtroom that in the years since @entity40 disappeared , there have been numerous dingo attacks on humans , some of them fatal			1
@entity56 , a lawyer assisting the coroner , described several of the attacks and said he believed the evidence showed that a dingo could have been responsible for @entity40 's death			1
he said : ' although it ( a dingo killing a child ) may have been regarded as unlikely in 1980 ... it should n't be by 2011 - 12			0
' the @entity35 say they want to set the record straight on behalf of their daughter			0
mrs @entity65 said outside the courthouse in the @entity21 capital , @entity68 : ' it gives me hope this time that @entity4 will finally be warned and realise that dingoes are a dangerous animal			2
' i also hope that this will give a final finding which closes the inquest into my daughter 's death , which so far has been standing open and unfinished			2
' @entity40 vanished from her tent in the @entity10 on august 17 , 1980 , during a family vacation to @entity81 , the giant red monolith now known by its @entity84 name @entity81			0
fellow campers told police they heard a low growl followed by a baby 's cry shortly before mrs @entity65 - who had been making dinner at a nearby barbecue area - went to check on her daughter			2
hate figures : @entity11 and her husband @entity94 faced intense hostility in @entity4 - even after the acquittal - because many people refused to believe a dingo was capable of killing a baby scene of tragedy : a file photo showing the camping area , including the @entity65 's tent , where her daughter @entity40 went missing , near the @entity81 sandstone rock , @entity21 , central @entity4 , 17 august 1980 mrs @entity65 said she saw a dingo run from the tent and disappear into the darkness			1
there were dingo prints outside the tent , and spots of blood on the bedding inside			0
upon seeing @entity40 's empty bassinet , @entity11 screamed , ' the dingo 's got my baby ! ' - a line made famous by the @entity122 movie , @entity123 , which is based on the case			1
@entity40 's body was never found , though her torn and bloodied jumpsuit turned up in the surrounding desert			0
officials , doubtful that a dingo was strong enough to drag away a baby , charged mrs @entity65 with murder			2
@entity134 treatment : @entity122 ( left ) played @entity65 ( right ) in the 1988 film @entity123 prosecutors said she slit @entity40 's throat in the family car - which initial forensic tests said was splashed with baby 's blood - and buried her in the desert			1
mrs @entity65 was convicted and sentenced to life in prison			0
years later , more sophisticated tests found that the ' blood ' in the car was a combination of milk and a chemical sprayed during manufacture			0
three years into mrs @entity65 's prison sentence , a jacket @entity40 had been wearing was found by chance near a dingo den. mrs @entity65 was released from prison and her conviction was overturned			0
still , three separate coroner 's inquests have failed to agree on a cause of death for @entity40			1
the last inquest , held in 1995 , returned an inconclusive finding , with the coroner saying there was not enough evidence to prove a dingo was responsible			2
dangerous : the @entity35 have gathered fresh evidence about dingo attacks on children which they hope will end relentless speculation that has followed them for 32 years since then , the @entity35 have gathered new evidence of around a dozen dingo attacks on children , three of them fatal , said their lawyer , @entity175			1
that evidence has been presented to ms @entity20 , the coroner , for consideration at today 's inquest			2
ms @entity20 is expected to issue her decision at a later date			0
in court , @entity15 fought back tears as he spoke of the nightmarish aftermath of his daughter 's death			1
he said : ' since the loss of @entity40 i have had an abiding fear and paranoia about safety around dingoes			0
they send a shudder up my spine			0
it is a hell i have to endure			0
' @entity4 have followed the case closely since it began , and most have strong opinions			2
although public support for ms @entity65 has grown over the years , many still doubt that a dingo could have killed @entity40 .			0

@entity11 and @entity15 present fresh evidence of dingo attacks on children
they want coroner to change @entity12 's *documented* cause of death from ' unknown '
case was the most notorious and controversial in @entity4 's legal history
their story was immortalised by @entity122 in the 1988 film @entity123
couple are still *fighting* to end speculation that they killed their baby
