much of the goodwill @entity2 built up as serving as secretary of state has dissipated , a new poll shows , just as she prepares for a second bid for the presidency			2
and her popularity has taken an especially hard hit since the public became aware that she operated a private email system while serving in president @entity12 's cabinet			1
a @entity15 / @entity14 survey taken last weekend , after @entity16 held a press conference at which she tried to explain away her secret server , found that @entity16 's high approval ratings as an @entity12 administration official had entirely eroded			1
that 's a six - point drop from @entity15 's last poll , taken in november , when 38 percent of respondents said they were n't fond of @entity16			1
likewise , a slim majority , 53 percent , said they view @entity16 positively , down from 59 percent a few months ago , and 69 percent at her career peak in the @entity34 in september of 2011			0
throughout her time as the country 's chief diplomat @entity16 generally enjoyed favorability ratings in the ' 60s			1
it was after she tendered her resignation in early 2013 that the public 's adoration of her began to slide , dipping to 55 percent after she claimed last spring that she and husband bill were ' dead broke ' when they moved out of the @entity45			0
after a quick bounce back up to 59 percent late last fall , @entity16 's likability now teeters above the majority water mark			2
this as the @entity51 politician is expected to formally launch her presidential campaign as early as the first week in april			0
@entity16 's last known paid speech , to the @entity53 , will take place on thursday , suggesting an announcement will come within weeks			0
a handful of @entity51 operatives are also rumored to be leaving their posts at the @entity45 and elsewhere soon for top spots in @entity16 's campaign network			0
former secretary of state @entity2 raises her glass during a toast at a ceremony to induct her into the @entity64 on monday in @entity65			0
this as the @entity51 politician is expected to formally launch her presidential campaign as early as the first week in april			0
her last known paid speech is this week a total of 51 percent of respondents to @entity15 's poll said they believe the email system revelations to be either very or somewhat serious in nature compared the combined 48 percent who said the controversy was not too serious or ' not a problem at all			1
' the same amount , 51 percent , said @entity16 needed to better explain her motives and that they believed she 'd done something ' wrong			2
' the split indicates that while the public haranguing of @entity16 over her use of a personal email address to conduct government business has mostly ended the subject could prove as an effective attack line for @entity16 's @entity91 opponent in the general election next year			2
still , 52 percent said @entity16 's actions do n't disqualify her from serving as commander in chief , and 57 percent said they 'd be ' proud ' to have her in the @entity97 - up from 50 percent the last time @entity15 's pollsters asked potential voters the same question in march of 2014 .			1

the high approval rating @entity16 enjoyed as an @entity12 administration official has entirely eroded
she 's currently disliked by as many @entity23 , 44 percent , as she was in june of 2008 when she ended her presidential bid and endorsed @entity12
that 's a six - point drop from @entity15 's last poll , taken in november , when 38 percent of respondents said they were n't fond of @entity16
still , 52 percent said her secret server is n't *relavent* to her abilitiy to be president ; 57 percent said they 'd be ' proud ' to have her in the @entity97
