by @entity0 published : 10:55 est , 11 october 2012 updated : 17:28 est , 11 october 2012 all kinds of forms of transport are going electric these days , as scientists and engineers dream up new ways to get us around without spewing clouds of harmful fossil fuel emissions			2
but they have perhaps gone a little far this time , by electrifying one form of transport that never actually caused any greenhouse gases at all			0
the @entity13 is claimed to be built around the world 's first chainless hybrid technology for an e-bike			0
something seems to be missing ... the @entity18 claims to be the world 's first e-bike to operate without a chain like other pedelecs the @entity13 combines manual and electric power			1
however , unlike other similar machines , it totally eliminates the chain and transforms the cyclist 's efforts directly into electricity to drive the wheels			1
made by @entity34 auto - parts supplier @entity33 , the footloose is based on the premise that the chain is the most annoying component in most bikes , @entity31 reports			2
so instead of using one to drive the wheels , the bike 's pedals transform the riders kinetic energy directly into electricity via an alternator connected to the crank			1
compact : when not in use the footloose folds up for easy carriage on public transport or in the boot of a car this energy is then stored in a lithium - ion battery inside the bikes frame , before it is converted back into kinetic energy by an electric motor which drives the rear wheel			1
like a modern car , the @entity13 has an @entity60 ( @entity60 ) which works with sensors to monitor terrain and an automatic gear changer to adjust the motor 's output to suit			0
this @entity60 also monitors the contraption to identify any problems , which it then displays by means of a handlebar mounted @entity70 ( @entity71 )			0
the @entity70 , which also gives the rider data about distance travelled , speed and the amount of electricity produced , is removable and doubles as an integrated anti-theft device since the bike will only start if its connected			0
@entity80 have not announced a price for the product , but it has been reported that it is scheduled for release some time in 2013			0
however , critics point out that the overall efficiency of the machine may be a weak point			2
with a chain - drive working out at about 98 per cent efficient , it is difficult for any new technology to equal the raw capabilities of a standard bicycle .			1

the @entity18 transforms pedal power directly into electric energy
critics claim it could not equal the efficiency of a chain - powered bike
