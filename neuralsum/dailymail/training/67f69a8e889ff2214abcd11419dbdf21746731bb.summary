by @entity0 published : 20:56 est , 1 july 2013 updated : 03:07 est , 5 july 2013 all animals and plants will vanish from the @entity4 within the next billion years , a new study suggests			1
ironically , @entity5 is going to arrive as a result of too little , rather than too much , carbon dioxide in the atmosphere			1
currently experts are trying to find ways to cut levels of the greenhouse gas to prevent global warming running out of control			2
as the @entity16 heats up , much of the @entity4 will come to resemble the @entity18 region in @entity19 in @entity20 , @entity21 ( pictured ) , scientists believe			0
all animals and plants will vanish from the @entity4 within the next billion years , a new study suggests but as the @entity16 ages and grows hotter , greater evaporation and chemical reactions with rainwater will take away more and more carbon dioxide			1
in less than a billion years , its levels will be too low for photosynthesising plants to survive , say scientists			1
when that happens , life as we know it on @entity4 will cease to exist			2
with the loss of plants , herbivorous animals will also die out , as well as the carnivores that prey on them			1
eventually microbes will be all that remains - and for the majority of them even their days will be numbered			2
after another billion years , the oceans will have dried out completely leaving only the hardiest bugs			1
‘ the far - future @entity4 will be very hostile to life by this point , ’ said astrobiologist @entity48 , from the @entity49 in @entity50			2
astrobiologist @entity54 ' bleak prediction that @entity5 will arrive as a result of too little carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is in contrast to popular @entity60 impressions of an asteroid striking the earth ‘ all living things require liquid water , so any remaining life will be restricted to pockets of liquid water , perhaps at cooler , higher altitudes or in caves underground			1
’ the surviving organisms would also have to cope with extreme high temperatures and intense ultraviolet radiation , he said			0
mr @entity48 made his bleak forecast at the @entity75 taking place at the @entity49			0
the predictions are based on a computer simulation of the impact long - term changes to the @entity16 are likely to have on @entity4			0
as the @entity16 ages over the next billion years or so , it is expected to remain stable but to grow steadily brighter			1
the increasingly intense radiation will cause the @entity4 to heat up to such an extent that the oceans start to evaporate			0
the research may have implications for the search for extra-terrestrial life , according to mr @entity48			0
‘ when we think about what to look for in the search for life beyond @entity4 our thoughts are largely constrained by life as we know it today , which leaves behind tell - tale fingerprints in our atmosphere like oxygen and ozone , ’ he said			0
‘ life in the @entity4 ’s far - future will be very different to this , which means , to detect life like this on other planets we need to search for a whole new set of clues			0
‘ we have now simulated a dying biosphere composed of populations of the species that are most likely to survive to determine what types of gases they would release to the atmosphere			0
‘ by the point at which all life disappears from the planet , we ’re left with a nitrogen / carbon - dioxide atmosphere with methane being the only sign of active life			2

astrobiologist @entity54 says the *sun* will get hotter and hotter causing greater evaporation which will reduce carbon dioxide levels
this will mean there is eventually too little *co2* for plants to survive
when they die out , herbivores will also die out , followed by carnivores
microbes will then be all that remains until another billion years later when the seas will also dry out meaning very little life will remain
