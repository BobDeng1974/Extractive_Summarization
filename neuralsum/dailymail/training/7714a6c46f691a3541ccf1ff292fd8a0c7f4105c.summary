death row inmate @entity0 , whose execution has been blocked after challenging @entity3 's lethal injection procedure the @entity5 @entity4 has blocked the execution of three inmates on death row in @entity3 after they challenged the state 's lethal injection procedure			1
the decision means that convicted killers @entity0 , @entity13 and @entity14 will not be put to death using a sedative , which they have claimed is cruel			1
however , the court 's order does leave open the possibility that the state could proceed with the executions of the prisoners using different drug combinations			2
last week , the high court agreed to hear the case , but did not block the inmates ' death sentences at that time			0
arguments before the high court are set for april , with a decision due by the end of june			1

he could be seen twisting on the gurney after death chamber staff failed to place the iv properly			0
the inmates challenging the state 's procedures argue the sedative midazolam , used by @entity3 , can not achieve the level of unconsciousness required for surgery , making it unsuitable for executions			2
@entity49 , an attorney representing the inmates said : ' the scientific evidence tells us that even the proper administration of midazolam can result in an inhumane execution			0
but the state of @entity3 contends its current drug combination is appropriate and effective			0
@entity3 governor @entity58 explained : ' i disagree with the necessity to grant @entity0 yet another round of legal appeals			2
' however , given that the @entity5 @entity4 has decided to hear his case , it is entirely appropriate to delay his execution until after the legal process has run its course			2
the executions of @entity14 , left , and @entity13 , right , have also been blocked after a @entity4 order @entity0 , who was convicted of arranging for his employer to be beaten to death , was scheduled to be executed on thursday			1
after hearing the news that his execution has been blocked , @entity0 told the @entity75 : ' i 've felt amazing today			1

the @entity4 's , pictured , order does leave open the possibility that the state could proceed with the executions of the prisoners using different drug combinations @entity13 , who stabbed a correctional worker to death , was due to be executed on february 19 , while @entity14 , convicted of killing his nine - month - old daughter , was scheduled for execution on march 5			1
in a similar case earlier this month , the high court declined to halt @entity3 's execution of @entity99 , convicted of raping and murdering an 11 - month - old baby			0
@entity99 had raised the same legal question as the other inmates .			0
