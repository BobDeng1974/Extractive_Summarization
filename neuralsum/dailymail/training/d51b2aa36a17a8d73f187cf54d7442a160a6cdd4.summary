by @entity0 published : 13:01 est , 19 july 2013 updated : 13:01 est , 19 july 2013 most of us have committed a fashion faux pas as teenagers that we 'd rather forget			2
but for actress @entity7 , her past style disasters are plastered all over the internet			1
as the child star of films including @entity11 and @entity12 , she had to grow up in front of the camera and made some red carpet dress choices she now looks back on in horror			1
' i was a 17 - year - old fright fest ! ' she told @entity19 's digital magazine , the edit , referring to her outfit when she attended the @entity22 for the first time in 1997			2
in style : @entity7 wears a @entity26 dress in the fashion shoot for @entity28 former child star : the actress said she became more comfortable in her own skin in her twenties			1
she wears dress by @entity34 and shoes by @entity36 , left , and jacket and skirt by @entity40 , shoes by @entity41 , right ' i 'd dyed my hair blonde for a role and i was overweight			2
but then , i do n't know anyone who looks back and says , " oh , you should see what i looked like at 17 … ' " she added that at that time she was n't lent designer gowns to wear so instead she picked her own from @entity50			1
but at the age of 33 with her acting career still going strong , she said she 's found her style and now has her pick of the best dresses to wear			0
in the magazine 's shoot with photographer @entity64 , she models romantic pieces by @entity59 , @entity40 , @entity26 , @entity34 , @entity60 and @entity61			0
grown up : now , left in an @entity59 dress , and in 1997 at the @entity22 in a gown she bought from @entity50 she said : ' i got smaller and more comfortable with myself			1
it was a gradual thing			0
as i got older , i became more like my mother			1
i began to wear what i wanted to wear			0
' i 'm finding i do n’t want to stick to my rigid rules any more			0
now i think , " well , i ’ve never worn those kind of pants before - let ’s try them ! " ' now the actress has to make her biggest style choice of all as she decides what dress to wear when she weds fiancé @entity82			1
white wedding : @entity7 is currently planning her nuptials			1
she wears an @entity60 dress , left , and jacket and skirt by @entity61 , right , but has n't yet revealed who will design her bridal gown the pair met on the set of tv show @entity93 and @entity7 said she has n't turned into a bridezilla over their nuptials			0
' i just want everyone to have a nice time and to feel happy , ' she said of her wedding day			1
' i could have easily gone the other way , where i was controlling every detail , but it ’s so unpleasant to be like that			0
if the flowers are n’t exactly the right shade , then so be it			0
' she remained tight - lipped on who is designing her gown but confirmed it would be white and she had n't had any creative input			0
fashion faux pas : the actress , with her @entity114 co-stars , does not look back on her outfit at the @entity22 with pride career spanning the decades : as wednesday in the @entity11 , left , and recently in tv show @entity93 she said : ' a reporter asked me about it and i said i was looking at sketches			1
somehow that ended up as " @entity7 ’s designing the dress , " which i have no intention of doing ... my mother wore a baby - blue @entity128 for her wedding			2
at first , i thought it would be sweet to be a bride in blue , and then i thought , no. it ’s the one time , @entity134 willing , that i ’ll wear a wedding dress , so i ’m wearing white			2
' she added that once she 's tied the knot she 'd love to start a family .			0
