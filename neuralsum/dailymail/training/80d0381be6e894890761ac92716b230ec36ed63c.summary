@entity3 - @entity2 had been sleeping in the bottom bunk for two months after a health visitor said she should be given her own room			1
her parents fitted a bed brace to ensure @entity15 did n’t fall out of the bottom bunk , but the little girl somehow managed to wriggle between the bars of the ladder leading to the top bunk and got stuck against the mattress			1
the freak incident just days before @entity22 last year left @entity15 suspended from the bed by her neck			1
she was found by her father as he was getting his other daughter ready for nursery			2
@entity15 was rushed to hospital by ambulance but was pronounced dead despite attempts to revive her			1
at an inquest in @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity15 ’s devastated parents @entity34 , 23 , and @entity36 , 24 , warned other parents not to put young children in their own beds - especially bunk beds because of the dangers			1
the hearing was told @entity15 had been given her own room as the couple ’s eldest daughter @entity43 , aged three , had difficulty sleeping properly when she was not in the same bedroom as her parents			1
the couple did not want @entity15 to have the same habits as her sister so they decided to put her in her own room in the bottom bunk			1
safety precautions : @entity3 - @entity2 's mother @entity34 and father @entity36 had secured a bed brace to prevent the eight - month - old from falling out miss @entity34 told the inquest : ' i did n’t put @entity59 in her own bed and she got too attached to us			1
i wanted @entity3 to be different and she was			2
she was in bed every night for 7pm and woke up a happy child			2
' sound sleeper : @entity3 - @entity2 had been sleeping in the bed for two months without a problem ahead of the incident she added that the intention was to have both girls sleeping together once they were in a routine			1
she added : ' i spoke to my health visitor about it and she had a rule about putting them in their own room at six months			2
' i asked her advice and that ’s when we came up with the bed brace so she could n’t fall out			1
' one of them attaches underneath the mattress and fastens at the other side of the frame and sticks up at the end to stop her from falling			2
' she had slept in the bunk for about two months			2
she had been doing really well and went down easily and found it better to fall asleep in that bed than the travel cot			2
' the inquest was told that the pillow was always put at the opposite end to the ladders and the bed was pushed up to the wall			2
the night before her death on december 17 , @entity15 was put to bed as usual at 7pm and ' went down fine '			1
she was found trapped in the bed at 8am the following morning			1
the @entity100 recommends babies sleep in a crib , a carry cot or a @entity105 basket in the same room as the parents for the first six months			2
it also urges parents not to sleep in the same bed as their baby if they smoke , drink or take drugs or are extremely tired , if their baby was born prematurely or was of low birth - weight			1
@entity116 guidelines suggest a firm mattress that fits the cot snugly without leaving spaces around the edges , so babies can not trap their head and suffocate			0
the @entity116 also recommends light blankets , ruling out pillows and duvets as unsafe for babies younger than a year old due to the risk of suffocation			0
guidelines also say cots must be sturdy with gaps in the bars no wider than 2.5 inches			0
@entity133 warns bedding to be avoided includes memory foam mattresses , water beds , feather beds , soft mattresses , bean - bags or bead - filled pillows and , according to the @entity141 , sheepskin rugs are a risk factor as soon as babies starts trying to roll on to their front			0
the @entity144 ( @entity144 ) says that when a child begins to climb out of its cot , this is usually a sign that he or she is ready to sleep in a bed			0
anything from 18 months onwards is about the right age to consider the transition			0
@entity144 also warns that bunk beds can pose a hazard to children under six years of age where entrapment ( becoming wedged or trapped in the bed ) can lead to strangulation , suffocation and injury to the neck or spine			1
miss @entity34 added : ' she was a very good child and she hardly cried			0
she could feed herself and we would give her her bottle and she used to fall back to sleep and have a nap			0
' she added : ' she obviously never ended up waking up			0
' i want something that may change the age of putting kids in their own beds and spread the word about bed braces because they can be dangerous			0
' mr @entity36 added : ' just do n’t put a child in a bed when young			0
' @entity179 dr @entity178 said the cause of death was from suspension of the neck and that there had n’t been any underlying natural disease owing to her death			0
she said : ' there was a number of external minor marks to the neck and shoulder , but very mild and were entirely consistent to where @entity3 was found to be in a collapsed state			1
' my opinion is that death was due to suspension by the neck			0
' @entity3 was previously well , she was essentially found wedged between the mattress with her body hanging over , essentially she was suspended by the neck			1
' dr @entity201 added that there was nothing to suggest the child was being neglected			0
' in my opinion , with the history i was given , the appropriate cause of death was suspension by the neck			0
' @entity211 coroner @entity210 recorded a verdict of accidental death and told @entity15 ’s parents said : ' there ’s nothing i can say that can make this any better at all			1
' you were doing what you thought at the time was right , in hindsight that was n’t necessarily , but you ca n’t apportion any blame			0
that was a judgement that you made			0
' the appropriate verdict is one of accidental death			0
this was nothing more , nothing less than a tragic accident			0
