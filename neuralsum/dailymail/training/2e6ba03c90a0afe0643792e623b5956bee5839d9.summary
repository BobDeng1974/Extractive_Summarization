an @entity1 aerospace company has developed a light - weight solar - powered drone that can fly at 65,000 feet for five years			2
the @entity4 series , the largest of which measures 60 metres wide , are classed as a ' @entity6 solar atmospheric satellites capable of carrying telecom , reconnaissance and atmospheric sensors			1
' the @entity4 aircraft is self - sufficient - it is covered in around 3,000 solar panels producing about 7 kw of electricity - it will fly above the clouds , so it would be exposed to sunlight constantly during daylight hours and store energy for the night flight			1
the largest plane @entity38 - based company @entity37 plan to build , is the @entity4 60 , which could carry up to 250 pounds of payload , such as anything from signals intelligence gear or electro - optical sensors to communications equipment			1
the @entity4 and @entity44 will be launched with a catapult , according to @entity47 website			2
travel : cruising speed for the @entity4 is about 65 mph , and the unmanned craft will have an operating range of over 2.8 million miles capacity : the largest plane they plan to build , the @entity4 60 , could carry up to 250 pounds anything from signals intelligence gear or electro - optical sensors to communications equipment power : it is covered in around 3,000 solar panels producing about 7 kw of electricity - it will fly above the clouds , so it would be exposed to sunlight constantly during daylight hours			1
wingspan and payload : 60 metres wide			1
carry a payload of 250 pounds costing : estimated to cost in the region of $ 2 million			1
speed : cruising speed for the @entity4 is about 65 mph , and the unmanned craft will have an operating range of over 2.8 million miles			1
function : carrying out functions such as surveillance , crop - monitoring , weather and disaster oversight , or any other monitoring that low - altitude satellites track			2
distance : the unmanned craft will have an operating range of over 2.8 million miles			0
they are designed to be cheaper than the cost of a satellite , while carrying out similar functions such as surveillance , crop - monitoring , weather and disaster oversight , or any other monitoring that low - altitude satellites track			2
one is scheduled for completion next year and could cost less than $ 2 million , according to @entity90 , reports @entity35 @entity34			1
the magazine quotes @entity92 , @entity37 ’s chief electrical engineer , as saying , ' we ’re trying to do a single - million - dollar - per - aircraft platform			1
and the operation cost is almost nothing — you ’re paying some dude to watch the payload and make sure the aircraft does n’t do anything stupid			2
' @entity37 ’s website says it has orders for three of the @entity104 and one of the @entity106			0
although they have not divulged who placed the order @entity108 website speculates the most obvious customers for the @entity4 in the defense and intelligence world would be the @entity115 , @entity116 and @entity117			2
chief technology officer @entity118 , told @entity108 , early discussions had been held with some of the intelligence agencies			0
to illustrate how responsive the aircraft are mr @entity118 told the website that two planes could be positioned in a satellite orbit at either end of the @entity1 and if needed in an emergency they could be repositioned to take photos , provide @entity129 cell coverage or help with mapping			0
pioneering : mr @entity118 said of the @entity132 series : ' this is the holy grail of edge - of - space access ... ' future : chief technology officer @entity118 , told @entity108 , early discussions had been held with some of the intelligence agencies functions : they are designed to be cheaper than the cost of a satellite , while carrying out similar functions such as surveillance , crop - monitoring , weather and disaster oversight , or any other monitoring that low - altitude satellites track new beginnings : the @entity4 series differ from the more traditional drones developed such as the predator drone , right , which is powered by an engine , driven by a propeller , can fly up to 400 nautical miles ( 740 km ) to a target , loiter overhead for 14 hours , then return to its base mr @entity118 told @entity158 : ' we 've been developing this for a number of years			1
' ' obviously there are some very exciting programmes that have been attempted over the years			0
this is the holy grail of edge - of - space access ...			0
we 've taken the lessons learned from all of those programmes '			0
' we make heavy use of the latest and greatest composite materials and advanced composite techniques developed over recent years , ' @entity118 continues			0
' there are actually fantastic advances in composites that allow us to meet the strength and weight requirements			0
we employ the entire spectrum			0
' the @entity4 series differ from the more traditional drones developed such as the predator drone , which is powered by an engine , driven by a propeller , can fly up to 400 nautical miles ( 740 km ) to a target , loiter overhead for 14 hours , then return to its base .			0

the @entity4 aircraft measures 60 metres wide , and has a cruising speed of 65pmh
it is self - sufficient - it would have 3,000 solar panels producing about 7 kw of electricity flying above the clouds
aircraft is scheduled for next year and could cost in the region of $ 2 million - four orders have been placed so far
classed as ' solar atmospheric satellites capable of carrying telecom , reconnaissance and atmospheric sensors '
