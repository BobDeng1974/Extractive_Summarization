by @entity1 reporter a shocking new story reveals that the @entity4 army inadvertently had an 8 - year - old boy turn into a spy and place electronic tracking devices on his surrogate father so that they could spot him and kill him in a scheduled drone attack			1
the 8 - year - old boy and his biological father have confessed to helping spy on the @entity14 officer , and now the biological father is believed to have been executed while the fate of the young boy remains unknown			1
the thorough story was reported by the @entity19 , who claim that the boy , named @entity22 , helped lead @entity4 drones to an @entity14 operative named @entity25 who had been placed on the @entity4 ‘ kill list ’ due to his role in the @entity29 branch of the terrorist organization			1
@entity51 was sent away by his father and mother who lived in @entity54 to go live with a wealthier distant relative in the smaller town of @entity57 , where @entity25 lived			0
@entity51 's family were not among @entity29 's most unlucky , as both parents were alive and the father was employed by the @entity61 , but their growing family and his small salary was not enough to support him			2
the @entity61 is an elite faction of the country ’s military , and they have worked with @entity4 forces in the past in order to help locate terrorists			2
unbeknownst to both @entity22 and his father , @entity71 , in the early fall of 2012 , the @entity4 had called upon the @entity61 to help them locate @entity25			2
family ties : @entity22 's biological father , @entity71 ( left ) , had sent the boy to live with extended family because he had too little money to feed his five other children , but those relatives rejected @entity22 ( right ) and he began living on the street until @entity81 took him in and cared for him because of the @entity71 ’s financial situation , @entity51 was sent away while his five brothers and sisters stayed with his parents in @entity54			1
after months of @entity22 scavenging for plastic bottles to sell and living off food and shelter where he could get it			0
at one point , @entity25 took pity on him and brought @entity22 in his home to live among his own five children			0
@entity94 : @entity81 ( pictured ) was on the @entity4 ' kill list ' and @entity97 's superiors in the @entity61 - which supports @entity4 forces - arranged to have @entity22 place tracking devices on @entity25 in addition to giving the young boy food , clothing , and a warm place to sleep , he also paid for his education			1
by that time , @entity4 officials approached the @entity61 about finding @entity25 , who they believed to be a top @entity14 operative who was vaguely connected to a thwarted suicide attack on a @entity4 base in @entity54			1
some members of the @entity61 knew that @entity22 's biological father , @entity71 , needed money and that @entity22 was being cared for by @entity25			1
in order to make the connection , the @entity61 offered to give @entity51 's family a new house , car and 50,000 @entity29 iyals which converts to about $ 230			0
@entity71 struck a deal with his higher - ups and drove from @entity54 to @entity122 , which was only a few miles away , to pick up his once - dismissed son			0
the @entity19 reported that @entity22 was thrilled to be reunited with his parents and siblings for a few days , and then his father took him to a meeting with @entity61 officials on october 25 , less than two weeks before the 2012 presidential election			0
during the meeting , they taught the boy how to activate the electronic chips and stressed how important it was for the boy not to tell @entity25 about the devices , adding that he needed to plant them on the target a week later			0
@entity51 's biological father , @entity71 , then drove his son back to @entity57 and the boy re-established contact with his former surrogate father			1
@entity25 took @entity22 back into his home , and on october 31 , the pint - sized spy made his move			0
' i climbed on the table where his coat was and put [ a tracking chip ] in his pocket , ' @entity51 recounted later in a confession video			0
a world away : just hours after president @entity152 was re-elected , the drone strike took place that killed @entity25 and another colleague using the tracking data that the chip @entity22 planted had helped collect he also put a second chip beneath a cupboard , but he later removed that one because he feared that it was going to be spotted			1
the tracking device was planted on the 31st , and a week went by - an important one where @entity152 was re-elected - before the drone strike was actually ordered			0
a day after the votes were counted , a drone struck @entity25 and a colleague as they were driving			0
@entity168 officials denied the version of events to the @entity19 , taking particular issue with the implication that they recruited an 8 - year - old to do their dirty work			2
' the claim that the @entity4 government was in any way involved in purportedly using an 8 - year - old in this incident is unequivocally wrong , ' a @entity168 spokesman told the magazine			1
while the @entity4 got their target , @entity14 eventually got theirs as well , capturing @entity22 and his father and forcing them to make a confession video where they explain what @entity61 officers they had spoken to and what their roles in the set up were			2
the video was released on the internet , publicly releasing the confession , but they have not addressed the status of @entity71 or his son			0
local sources told the @entity19 that @entity71 was undoubtedly executed , though @entity14 may have spared the 8 - year - old because they claimed his innocence was taken advantage of by his father .			1

new allegations claim that an 8 - year - old @entity29 boy who was *abandoned* by his biological family was then roped back into their *clutches*
the boy 's biological father works for the @entity61 , which helps @entity4 forces , and they asked have an @entity14 operative located
that operative had been added to the @entity4 ' kill list '
the @entity61 knew that one of their officer 's children had been taken in by that target , @entity81 , so they called the biological father and asked him to have his son place the chip on the surrogate father
the boy *complied* and days later , @entity25 was killed in a drone strike
