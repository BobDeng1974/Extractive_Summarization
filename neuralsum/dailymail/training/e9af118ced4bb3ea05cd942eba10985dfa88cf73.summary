by @entity0 published : 09:14 est , 12 december 2012 updated : 09:14 est , 12 december 2012 every year , on the night of 30 november , i perform my special @entity3 countdown ritual			1
first i go up to the loft to collect a blue cardboard storage container			1
next i place the large , shallow box on my bed and carefully lift the lid , tantalised by the memory of the treasures within			1
not , as you might think , the decorations for the tree or the lights to festoon the doorways of my house			1
no , nestled inside , lovingly wrapped in tissue paper , are my collection of @entity3 jumpers			1
' far from stressing me out , @entity3 puts me in a jolly mood of hopeful expectation throughout december ' for a full month from 1st december until the clock strikes midnight on @entity23 i become the woman that style forgot , never missing an opportunity to sashay forth in a jazzy jumper , festooned with @entity3 cheer			1
long before @entity29 wore his embarrassing @entity3 reindeer jumper in the film @entity32 , and aeons before jumper fiend @entity34 had started parading her vaguely christmassy , @entity37 star sweater in the killing ( available from @entity39 and @entity40 online , 100 % organic wool , @entity42 , if you 're interested in dressing up as a detective yourself when the @entity45 comes out on @entity46 ) , i was making my annual pilgrimage to @entity48 in search of a @entity3 sweater			1
' what i 've noticed is that my @entity3 jumpers put everyone else in a good mood as well ' and this year looks to be a vintage year for the jazzy jumper - they 've made it back into fashion in a big way			1
now even upmarket online retailer @entity60 has sanctioned the @entity3 sweater with a range of exclusive jumpers designed by the likes of @entity65 , @entity66 and hot new design duo @entity67 whose contribution , featuring metallic - embroidered christmas tree decorations , costs £ 945			1
meanwhile , the @entity72 , launched three years ago by @entity74 - based couple @entity73 and @entity75 , after amateur musician @entity76 failed to find the suitably ' daft ' @entity3 jumpers he and his band - mates wanted to wear for a @entity3 gig , is riding the crest of a @entity81 woollies wave after featuring in a @entity83 ad and on the @entity84			1
at a somewhat more affordable £ 40 , and available for men and women , they can barely keep up with the demand , especially for their shiny - nosed @entity90 model			2
only last week i was tempted by a @entity92 number , featuring a rosy - cheeked @entity93 , not quite a snip at £ 225			2
but what i eventually opted for was a more reasonably prices black @entity97 knitted number , £ 50 , featuring the cutest robin in a woolly hat with a ruby glass bobble and sporting a red breast shot through with lurex thread			2
@entity60 are selling @entity107 's @entity106 metallic - embroidered jumper for £ 945 , left , and @entity65 's reindeer intarsia wool - blend sweater for £ 695 then , while scanning the rails at @entity111 , i spotted a sweater that managed to feature snowmen , snowflakes , pudding and @entity3 trees all at once , and what looked like some tiger stripes added in for good measure			2
' @entity3 jumpers put everyone in a good mood ' a miracle of excess , and only £ 35			2
so i bought that , too , on the basis that that just as there is no such thing as a turkey with too many trimmings , the same applies to dressing to spread tidings of comfort and joy			2
i ca n't help myself			0
all year long i am a paradigm of pared - down style			0
my clothes are classic , tasteful - and probably a trifle dull			0
but come @entity3 i become as ho - ho - ho as @entity93 and as tinselly as the christmas tree			0
far from stressing me out , @entity3 puts me in a jolly mood of hopeful expectation throughout december , and i dress to match my mood , regardless of the sniggers i engender			1
for me a cosy @entity3 jumper or sparkly top or something unsuitably sequinned , which looks more barmaid than elegant lady of a certain age , represents the fantasy @entity3 i long for			0
on the one hand yule logs and real fires burning in the hearth , real candles on real trees , the scent of cinnamon and mulled wine ; on the other , glamorous parties , champagne and all - night dancing			0
the reality may be cooking 24/7 , grumpy relatives , uncooperative kids and a desultory dance around someone 's kitchen table on @entity23 , but for the weeks leading up to @entity3 i am more relaxed – and hopeful - than at any other time of year			0
what i 've noticed is that my @entity3 jumpers put everyone else in a good mood as well			0
complete strangers come up to me in cafes to remark on my jumper and we invariably end up getting to know one another			0
at the @entity175 , where i go to study , there is a permanent hush – but everyone looks up from their books and smiles as i pass			0
and now silly @entity3 sweaters have been co-opted for a good cause with a host of celebrities joining in the fun			0
@entity184 , @entity185 , @entity186 and @entity187 are just some of names who have been posing in @entity3 woollies , in aid of @entity192 , which has designated friday 14th december as @entity193 , inviting the nation to pull on a kitsch festive jumper and donate £ 1 to the charity			1
well i 'll be wearing mine anyway			0
