by @entity0 and @entity2 published : 06:46 est , 3 july 2013 updated : 07:48 est , 3 july 2013 watching while anthropologists painstakingly work to uncover the makeshift graves of their loved ones , this is a stark reminder of the horrific genocide from which they so desperately fled almost two decades on from the country 's civil war			1
with pain etched all over their faces , this is the first opportunity the @entity15 of @entity16 have had to say a proper goodbye to thousands of relatives killed 17 years after the bloodshed stopped			1
forensic experts are now exhuming bodies from the cemeteries that the @entity24 people created to bury loved ones who died of starvation , hypothermia and disease - as well as those directly killed by the war - while they hid from the soldiers in the mountains			1
largely ignored by authorities for centuries , the @entity33 have come under the spotlight in recent months after a @entity16 court found former dictator @entity38 guilty of genocide in may for the scorched - earth policies used against the @entity41 during his 17 months in power in the 1980s			1

and now feels like the right time for many of the @entity33 to tell their story and to help locate the bodies of their relatives			2
almost 20 years on , the @entity33 still live in mud - and - wood houses in the most rugged and isolated parts of northwestern @entity16			2
most of them have no drinking water , paved roads or basic services such as health and education			2
@entity88 , a social anthropologist who has worked in the area for a decade , said @entity91 live in the same poverty as always			1
he said : ' people have been relegated to less productive places , places where you ca n't grow food , to the mountains made of stone			0
' the young people who can , sow plots of land			0
and when they ca n't , they migrate			0
' @entity103 : a forensic anthropologist exhumes the remains of nine - year - old @entity106 from a mass grave giving guidance : @entity24 women help a team of anthropologists to find a mass grave in @entity16 horrific history : a group of @entity24 men , women and even children gather around as an extensive search is carried out for some of the thousands killed during the civil war which ended 17 years ago exhumation : the @entity91 hid in the mountains from soldiers during the war and buried many of their dead in mass graves			1
many of the dead died from starvation , hypothermia or disease @entity133 was 8 when soldiers attacked her village			0
she and her family separated and ran into the mountains , where they hid for several days with nothing to eat			0
@entity133 said her mother was killed when the army bombed the village and surrounding area , and her grandmother died later after growing sick from the cold and bad living conditions			2
her family eventually lost their land and their poverty deepened			0
now a single mother of three children , the 40 - year - old @entity133 borrows electricity from a neighbor and supports her kids by washing the clothes of neighbors and weaving garments to sell			0
' i grew up during the civil war and i do n't know how to read or write			1
i did n't go to school			0
all i know is to weave			0
' @entity161 : anthropologist @entity162 shows his left hand with the names of surrounding villages written by children , before the start of an exhumation of a clandestine grave near @entity61 , @entity16 forlorn : @entity33 @entity91 make their way home after watching the exhumation of a clandestine grave forgotten culture : @entity53 women perform a traditional dance called ' @entity177 ' in @entity178 , @entity16 @entity133 helped exhume her mother and said that she feels that revisiting the graves proves that they are not ' inventing the dead			1
' she said : ' i helped exhume my mother			0
i do n't know if it was the smoke or the impact of the bombs planes were dropping on us but we all left running and when we got back together , my mother had already died			0
' she added that she doubts justice will be done , but is glad some fellow @entity192 could travel to @entity193 to tell their stories at the trial			2
mr @entity197 , who now lives in the @entity16 capital , said that victims feel a need to tell their stories , to be heard , to be indemnified , to find the bodies of their loved ones and be able to bury them			1
way of life : @entity53 women take part in a procession honoring their patron saint , @entity209 in @entity178 religious : a woman prays in front of a @entity214 guardian statue , dressed as a @entity44 elder , inside a church in @entity217 poor : @entity218 prepares tortillas over a wood burning stove as her husband eats bolbosh , a traditional dish made with wisquil , or pear squash , in their mud house			0
many @entity91 still live in poverty in @entity16 only way to keep warm : an @entity44 boy carrying fire wood poses for a photo in @entity233 , @entity16			1

thousands of @entity192 were killed while hiding in the mountains during the @entity16 civil war
