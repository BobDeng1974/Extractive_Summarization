by @entity0 last updated at 1:36 pm on 2nd november 2011 @entity2 bosses told a motorist it was his own fault his £ 45,000 luxury car repeatedly broke down - because he was n’t driving fast enough			1
@entity6 was astonished by to be told that it was his ' inappropriate ' driving style that was responsible for a year of trouble with his dream car			1
during that time , the saloon ground to a complete halt on three occasions , needed a week - long repair on another , and regularly went into a ' protective mode ' when it he did n't drive above 30mph			2
' too slow ' : @entity6 was told he is to blame for his £ 45,000 @entity17 repeatedly breaking down - because he was n't driving fast enough a light warning that indicates a problem with the diesel particulate filter ( @entity21 ) has turned on 15 times since he bought the three - litre @entity17 last november			1
@entity2 blame the failures on a ' driving style issue '			1
they say the @entity21 – which eliminates black exhaust fumes - becomes clogged up unless the car gets a good , fast run			2
otherwise it can cause the vehicle to stop			2
mr @entity6 , 47 , from @entity30 , @entity31 , works as an estate agent and says most of his journeys are short , within a few miles of his office			1
he said : ' i was never told i had to drive in any particular way			1
you buy a prestige car and you expect to be able to drive it at whatever speed you want			2
' as it happens i consider myself to be naturally a fast driver , and i ’ve had points for speeding			2
' you do n’t imagine that a quality car would suffer from you going too slowly			2
i dreamed of owning a @entity44 but it ’s not been a great experience			2
' the father - of - three bought the car second - hand when it was just 18 - months - old			2
now @entity31 - based dealers @entity2 have not only told him that problems are down to the way he ’s driving the car , they ’ve also said that further failures wo n’t be covered by the three - year warranty			1
warning light : the diesel particulate filter - which eliminates black exhaust fumes - becomes clogged up unless the car gets a ' good , fast run ' mr @entity6 said : ' they ’ve told me that the problem is that i ’m driving too many short journeys and driving too slowly			1
i ’ve driven a diesel before and the salesman knew i was an estate agent doing local , short journeys			1
' they say i ’m doing too much town driving			1
' i think there ’s a fault with the car			0
if i ’d bought a @entity73 or a @entity74 i would accept what they ’re saying , but the car in question is a luxury saloon			0
' mechanics at @entity80 carried out tests on the @entity21 and sent the data to @entity2			0
their response was : ' looking at the average speed for both trip computers and the @entity87 ’s stored in the vehicle , this is a driving style issue and will be chargeable to the owner			1
' please educate the customer on the driving cycles required to clean the filter reference the owner ’s handbook			1
' mr @entity6 said he has been stung by the criticism of his driving style and feels the dealers have tried to wash their hands of him			1
he is now considering legal action unless he gets a replacement car			0
he said : ' they were very good when they wanted to sell me the car			0
at first they treated it as a genuine problem , but now they just do n’t want to know			0
' on one occasion the car failed when he was 200miles from home in @entity114 , forcing him to make an unplanned overnight stay			0
“ the slower you drive , the less you clear the @entity21 , ” said mr @entity6			0
“ the orange warning light comes on if the filter is full and after that it ’ll go into protective mode			0
on one occasion it did that after just two miles			0
that light ’ s come on 15 times altogether			0
“ the car ’s computer tells you what average speed you ’ve been doing			0
they told me if i should n’t average below 15mph			1
since then i ’ve been monitoring the computer and the warning light ’s come on at 18mph			0
mr @entity128 said : ' we have a policy of not commenting on customer issues			0
' @entity2 declined to comment .			0
