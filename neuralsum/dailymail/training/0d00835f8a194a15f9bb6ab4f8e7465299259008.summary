the @entity1 premiere of the @entity3 movie that is at the center of its hacking crisis has been cancelled after it was threatened with a terrorist attack			1
screenings of the movie have also been cancelled at thousands of theaters across the country			1
early tuesday , the hacking group @entity12 , who have been systematically releasing email correspondence and leaking films after breaking into @entity3 's internal system , claimed an event similar to ' 11th of september 2001 ' would occur at theaters showing the film			1
@entity21 hackers are believed to be behind the cyber attack and now terrorist threat , angered over the film which tells the story of two men who travel to the secretive communist nation to kill leader , @entity27			1
the @entity29 chain , which operates 278 theaters in 41 states , is now the first chain who will not be showing the film when it opens			1
whose @entity36 location is one of the most famed and popular theaters in the country , will also not be showing the film			1
also backing out is @entity41 , who have now cancelled the film 's @entity1 premiere which was scheduled for thursday at the famed @entity45 in the city 's @entity46			1
the @entity71 reports , ' three people briefed on @entity3 ’s internal discussions on tuesday said the studio had decided to all but invite theater owners to force cancellation or further postponement of @entity55			1
' the @entity71 also spoke to one theater owner , who asked to remain anonymous , that called the reference to the 9/11 attacks a ' game changer			2
' @entity82 , spokesman for the @entity83 , would n't comment on the threats			2
@entity85 has contacted cinema groups including @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity89 for comment			2
all three companies experienced a drop in their stock price after the threat was announced			0
the chief executive of @entity3 , @entity65 , sent an email to employees on tuesday in which he told staff to ‘ remain vigilant			1
’ ‘ we are aware of the latest threat and are working closely with the @entity102 and other law enforcement agencies			0
please remain vigilant , ’ he wrote			0
the @entity102 has confirmed that it is looking into the credibility of the threat , with a spokesperson saying ; ' the @entity102 is aware of recent threats and continues to work collaboratively with our partners to investigate			1
' however a spokesperson for the @entity110 has said that they do n't believe that the threats are credible			1
' we are still analyzing the credibility of these statements , but at this time there is no credible intelligence to indicate an active plot against movie theaters within the @entity120 , ' said the spokesperson			1
laying low ? on wednesday night , @entity56 was seen leaving a restaurant in @entity1 wearing a hat and scarf while holding some headphones not backing down : @entity3 has also said that despite the threat , they will still be distributing the film the interview is a comedy in which @entity57 and @entity56 star as television journalists involved in a @entity133 plot to assassinate @entity21 leader @entity27			1
speculation about a @entity21 link to the @entity3 hacking has centered on that country 's angry denunciation of the film			1
over the summer , @entity21 warned that the film 's release would be an ‘ act of war that we will never tolerate , ' threatening a ‘ merciless ’ retaliation			1
the @entity102 has said that it is investigating the attack but has declined to comment on whether @entity21 or another country was behind the attack			0
as the @entity71 points out in their article , a film depicting the murder of a sitting world leader is almost unprecedented			0
the @entity155 threat released on tuesday reads : warning we will clearly show it to you at the very time and places the interview be shown , including the premiere , how bitter fate those who seek fun in terror should be doomed to			1
soon all the world will see what an awful movie @entity54 has made			0
the world will be full of fear			0
remember the 11th of september 2001			2
we recommend you to keep yourself distant from the places at that time			0
( if your house is nearby , you ’d better leave			0
) whatever comes in the coming days is called by the greed of @entity54			0
all the world will denounce the @entity3			2
some in the industry are also saying major theater chains that are publicly traded companies may not be able to even show the movie for fear of serious legal repercussions should these threats ultimately be true			2
' if something does happen at theaters showing @entity55 , today ’s hacker threat means that no one can say they did n’t know or at the very least have a reasonable expectation , explains deadline			1
and that means that any victims or their families could sue the theater or theater chain , and would likely win			0
this is much different than the mass shooting that happened in an @entity201 , @entity200 theater during a 2012 screening @entity202 as neither the studio , @entity204 , or the theater had any idea that there would be an incident of such horrific violence			0
that has not stopped many from suing the @entity89 owned @entity212 16 multiplex though , citing the lack of security on the premises which allowed shooter @entity217 to open fire during a midnight screening , killing 12 and injuring 70			0
and there is a very good chance they will win their cases , as over the summer a judge in @entity200 ruled against @entity89 's attempts to dismiss these lawsuits			2
' this is a horror show that does n’t seem to end , ' long time media investor @entity228 told @entity191			0
' why ca n’t this picture just be pulled off totally ? why do you need this headache ? there are plenty of other pictures out there			0
all these things are made in the self - reflective echo chamber of @entity36			0
' not happy : other studios like @entity242 , who is releasing @entity244 ( above ) on @entity70 , could also be affected by these threats @entity246 : the highly anticpated @entity247 , directed by @entity248 , is also set to be released on @entity70 the famous water tower at @entity250 in @entity251 , @entity34 this threat is also problematic for other studios releasing tent - pole films on @entity70			1
there are three other major releases on the holiday ; @entity242 's @entity244 , @entity259 's @entity247 and @entity204 's @entity258			0
fear among the public to go to theaters showing the interview will no doubt affect the box office of these films as well			2
also not helping the film may be the reviews coming in , that are decidedly mixed			0
@entity270 's @entity269 writes ; ' considering the controversy and chaos @entity250 is undergoing because of it , @entity55 fails to live up to the hype , floundering as a rowdy comedy as it grows duller by the minute			2
' even harsher was @entity275 , with @entity277 writing ; ' an alleged satire that ’s about as funny as a communist food shortage , and just as protracted			0

*guardians* of @entity282 have released a chilling new *message* including ominous threats against cinemas showing @entity3 's @entity55
the threat makes reference to the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001
now , @entity3 has told theaters that they can cancel screenings of the premiere if they feel *unsafe* , which opens on @entity70
the @entity29 chain , which operates 278 theaters in 41 states , is the first chain who will not be showing the film when it opens
the @entity1 premiere scheduled for thursday was also cancelled by @entity41
this as legal experts warn of the problem these theaters and chains could face in lawsuits should an attack be carried out that they were warned of
a @entity110 spokesperson has said that they do n't believe that the source of threats is credible
