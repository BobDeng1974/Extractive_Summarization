@entity1 's relentless drive to dominate football for the next decade shows no signs of abating			2
far from resting on their @entity8 laurels they are about to sign 18 - year - old @entity9 from @entity10 , snatching him from @entity11 in the process			1
the @entity14 under 19 midfielder is a @entity11 fan and looked destined to switch to the @entity15 in the summer but amid suggestions @entity11 wanted to pay in instalments , @entity1 have since stepped in with a firm £ 3million offer to grab him from their rivals			1
' i have decided to go to @entity1 and i am happy with my decision , ' he said on sunday night after appearing for @entity10 against @entity38			1
the player will stay at @entity10 until the end of this campaign on loan			2
@entity1 will take him back at the end of the season but @entity10 will be able to take another @entity1 youth teamer on loan in his place as part of the deal			1
the skilful left - footed midfielder is so highly rated by @entity1 that they have included a clause in his contract that for an extra 800,000 euros ( £ 635,000 ) they can take him in january and fast - track him straight into their first team squad if they are hit by injuries between now and the closing of the winter transfer window			2
the move is not just a success for @entity1 but another failure for @entity11 who looked close to signing the player in the summer only to miss out six months later			1
@entity9 was called up to @entity14 's @entity62 19 last month and is expected to be fast - tracked to the under 21 team as they rebuild after their failure to reach the @entity66			0
@entity68 ' move to @entity1 did not work out and he is now at @entity69 under @entity70 @entity1 manager @entity71 has the option to bring midfielder @entity9 to the club in january he must now work to ensure his dream move does n't end as @entity68 ' did			1
he was signed by @entity1 in similar circumstances in january 2010 from @entity77			0
he stayed there until the end of the season and joined @entity1 the following summer			0
but the 19 - year - old failed to develop at @entity1 where first - team chances among so many big signings were few and far between			0
@entity83 picked him in his first game in charge , against @entity10 , but he soon fell out of favour and injuries also became a problem			0
aged 23 , @entity68 is now at @entity69 under @entity70			0
real hope this time the boy wonder will fulfil his potential and not have to leave @entity1 to do so .			0

@entity9 is a @entity11 fan and seemed set to join from @entity10
but @entity1 stepped in with an offer of £ 3million
@entity9 was being watched by @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35
