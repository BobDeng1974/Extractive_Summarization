his honour judge @entity0 rejected the appeal a failed asylum seeker and his 11 - year - old daughter are demanding they must not be deported to @entity5 - because she would be banned from wearing the burka			1
the @entity8 father , 42 , says removing them from the @entity10 and forcing them to live across the @entity12 would amount to a breach of her religious rights			1
@entity5 banned women from wearing the burka - the full body covering - and the niqab or face veil in public three years ago			1
the pair arrived in @entity5 when fleeing from @entity22 in 2011			2
@entity10 is seeking to deport them and under @entity25 rules they should go to the first country they set foot in			0
the father , who can not be named , said : ‘ she loves to wear the burka			2
she already wears a burka during the weekdays , in the evenings and during the weekends			0
‘ she is very dedicated in following @entity37 dress code and religious practices and values			1
‘ if we are deported to @entity5 she would not be able to follow her religious values and practices			1
’ he told the court he does not force her to wear the burka			0
the case has already been rejected by the @entity47 in june this year but the pair have appealed and the @entity49 is set to hear the case within months			0
the @entity47 in @entity51 a woman wears a burka ( picture posed by model ) rejecting that appeal , mr @entity56 said the girl only wore a burka occasionally in public - and that in @entity5 she could continue wearing it in public			1
the father , 42 , who can not be named for legal reasons , says the pair will face religious persecution and even imprisonment if his daughter wants to fully express her religious beliefs			1
he claims he was forced to flee @entity22 with his daughter disguised , using false passports , because of his political views			2
the family arrived in @entity10 from @entity22 after travelling to @entity72 and then to @entity5			2
he says he travelled by coach to @entity72 with his daughter and then flew to @entity5 before landing at @entity74 in july 2011 , where he claimed asylum			1
their asylum bid was dismissed by the @entity80 and passed to the @entity5			2
he told immigration officials the girl would ‘ suffer ’ greatly in @entity5 because she wears the niqab			2
he said : ‘ but what about my daughter ’s school ? she wears a cover but @entity5 wo n’t accept her at school			1
mentally she will suffer a lot			0
’ after the @entity80 rejected the asylum claim , immigration officers went to the family home in @entity93 , but father and daughter had vanished			0
the case was then heard by the @entity47			0
rejecting the case , mr @entity56 said : ‘ whilst i accept that she would at least at risk of prosecution under the 2010 law if she wore a burka in public in @entity5 , she does not wear the burka in public a great deal yet , she wears it occasionally			1
‘ in @entity5 she will be able to wear it in certain circumstances , at places of worship such as a mosque			0
‘ if she is prosecuted she will be able to take the human rights point to the @entity112 if necessary			0
he added : ‘ consequently , any potential affronty that the claimant or his daughter may potentially suffer to their dignity at the hands of the @entity5 state if they were removed there , would fall short of degrading treatment			1
‘ there is no evidence that those authorities are systematically unable or unwilling to address , determine and remedy any alleged breach			0
‘ indeed , the evidence is quite to the contrary , namely that the @entity5 government and especially the @entity5 courts take their obligations in respect of human rights very seriously			2
’ in @entity5 women wearing a burka or niqab can be fined £ 125			1
other countries in @entity138 , including @entity139 , @entity140 and @entity141 also have restrictions on religious dress			0
last month a @entity10 judge ruled that a woman could wear a full - face veil during her trial but must remove it while giving evidence			0
however , she will still be screened from the court and only visible to the judge , jury and prosecution and defence lawyers .			0

*people* seen to be wearing a burka or niquab can be fined £ 125 in @entity5
