by @entity0 published : 09:34 est , 12 april 2013 updated : 05:51 est , 15 april 2013 two mothers driven to distraction by their teething babies have invented a device they believe will make life easier for new mothers everywhere			2
the @entity7 not only catches dribble but also helps to soothe the gums of teething infants thanks to a chewable triangular portion at the bottom of a scarf worn around the baby 's neck			2
the brainchild of friends @entity18 and @entity19 , the multi-purpose neckerchief can not be dropped on the ground - saving parents the hassle of constant sanitising			1
more than 1,000 have been sold in a matter of weeks and the pair , who met at an antenatal class in 2011 prior to birth of their first children , have heard from a number of global firms			1
innovative : the @entity7 , which combines a bib with a teether , has proved popular with parents specially made : the teether at the end of the bib is made from a material designed not to annoy tender gums the success is a world away from the birth of the design , which came about when the two mums chatted about their struggles with the tricky problem of dribbling , teething babies			0
the ' mumpreneurs ' seemed to spend much of their time cleaning dropped teethers			2
both were keen to find a solution			0
@entity18 , 48 , who lives in the @entity56 area of @entity57 with estate agent husband @entity58 and their 21 - month - old daughter , @entity59 , said : ' when children start to teethe , they dribble a lot and they want to chew everything they can get their hands on			1
' all any of us seemed to do was pick up and re-sanitise teethers , and we felt there had to be an easier way			0
that 's when we thought " well , what if the teether was somehow attached to the baby ? " ' sure that they had spotted a gap in the market , the pair spent the next nine months doing market research			0
@entity19 , 35 , who lives in @entity78 , @entity57 , with husband @entity79 , who works for the government , and their 20 - month - old son , @entity81 , said : ' we started to look into what kind of fabrics would be best and found one that is gentle enough for a baby but also absorbent enough to make sure dribble does n't soak through			1
' for the teething part , we found a material that is safe for babies to chew on , and that would n't peel or flake			0
' inventors : mothers @entity19 ( left ) and @entity18 ( right ) are behind the new teething device popular : @entity18 and @entity19 have sold 1,100 @entity96 since february and the device is in demand globally @entity19 , who is expecting a second child in june and is using her maternity leave to devote more time to the business , and @entity18 , an innovation manager at @entity101 , decided they wanted to keep their budding business in @entity104			1
@entity18 said : ' we found a company based in @entity107 called @entity108 who put together a great prototype , so we 're happy to be working with them			1
' since the product launched in february , the pair have been astonished by its success			2
@entity18 said : ' we 've sold over 1,100 already , double our projections for the first year			1
the feedback has been phenomenal			0
it 's such a simple idea , but people have really responded fantastically to it			0
' more than 20 independent stockists and four national retailers including @entity121 are set to have the @entity96 on the shelves by summer			2
@entity19 said : ' we 've also had interest from distributors in the @entity126 , @entity127 , @entity128 , @entity129 and @entity130 , so soon they could be taking over the world			1
' millionaire businessman sir @entity133 , founder of @entity134 , hailed the ' simple solution ' and said he was ' very pleased ' to hear of @entity18 and @entity19 's success			1
he added : ' it 's wonderful that these two ladies have been inspired to overcome this problem by creating a product that will not only serve them well , but will also be of a benefit to plenty of other parents			0
often simple solutions make the best ideas			0
i wish them the best of luck			0
' family affair : @entity151 founders @entity19 and @entity18 with son @entity81 and daughter @entity59 useful : the bib and teether combination is popular with parents who do n't have time to repeat sanitise teethers			1
