when @entity1 users try to search for the aubergine , or eggplant , emoji hashtag no posts appear - even if there are posts tagged in this way last night @entity1 rolled out its latest update that lets users create and search for hashtags using emoji			1
but it appears not all emoji hashtags are created equal			1
when people try to search for the aubergine , or eggplant , emoji using a hashtag on the app , no posts appear - even though there are posts that have been tagged with it			1
and it is believe to be because the emoji is commonly used to represent male genitalia and may be attached to images containing nudity			1
the anomaly was discovered by @entity29 from @entity30			0
emoji hashtags were released as part of @entity1 's latest app update , which also added three new filters and a redesigned @entity36 button			1
hashtags can now be used with single emoji , multiple emoji or can be combined with text in post , comments , captions and when using the @entity44 tab			1
@entity1 told @entity45 it is not commenting on the eggplant anomaly			1
but , given that the emoji could potentially be tagged onto images that contain nudity , it is likely the app is restricting its use under its community guidelines			1
it also appears the hashtag itself is n't banned across the app , instead it just ca n't be searched for			0
@entity1 's guidelines explain : ' we know that there are times when people might want to share nude images that are artistic or creative in nature , but for a variety of reasons we do nâ€™t allow nudity on @entity1			1
' this includes photos , videos , and some digitally - created content that show sexual intercourse , genitals , and close - ups of fully - nude buttocks			2
' it also includes some photos of female nipples , but photos of post-mastectomy scarring and women actively breastfeeding are allowed			0
nudity in photos of paintings and sculptures is ok , too			2
' ms @entity29 has even created a hashtag called # freetheeggplant			0
despite issuing an apparent ban on searching for the aubergine , searches for emojis such as the gun ( left ) and a syringe ( right ) are allowed			0
@entity1 does n't ban pictures of guns , although it does n't allow the sale of guns			2
in terms of the needle , many images posted using this hashtag include tattoos and giving blood following yesterday 's update , @entity1 users can post , explore other people 's photos and interact with captions using emoji			1
emoji are popular in the @entity1 community , with nearly half of @entity106 ( pictured on @entity112 's page ) already featuring the small pictures but she also noted that despite issuing an apparent blanket ban on searching for the aubergine emoji , searches for emojis such as the gun and a needle and syringe are allowed			1
@entity1 does n't ban pictures of guns on the app , although it does n't allow the sale of guns			2
in terms of the needle emoji , many images posted using this hashtag include tattoos and giving blood			0
however , if an image was to be posted of a person using drugs or guns in an illegal way @entity1 would remove it			1
from sending countless ' poops ' to adding hearts to sentimental messages , your choice of emoji says a lot about you			0
and experts recently analysed more than one billion uses of the tiny icons to see how they are used across different languages			0

to plot the differences in use , @entity177 - based keyboard app firm @entity154 analysed more than one billion sets of emoji data , covering 800 emoji across 60 categories			0
the findings of the report came from an analysis of data over a four - month period between october 2014 and january 2015 , and includes both @entity182 and @entity183 devices			0

@entity172 are twice as raunchy as all other languages , according to the emoji study			0
they use twice as many so - called ' raunchy humour emoji ' , including the banana , eggplant , peach , cherries and @entity204 astrological symbol than average			2
@entity188 and @entity148 are half as raunchy as the average and @entity162 @entity185 speakers are the top users of the eggplant emoji at more than double the average			2
@entity193 use the banana emoji the most			0

they use twice as many so - called ' raunchy humour emoji ' , including the banana , eggplant , peach , cherries and @entity204 astrological symbol than average ( pictured ) this would rely on either the image being reported by a fellow member or @entity1 seeing the image itself			1
subsequently , this suggests it will potentially allow images of illegal activity to appear in search , when tagged in this way , and act on it retrospectively but wo n't allow images of nudity to appear in the search results at all			1
