@entity63 about : the ' @entity64 sees them swarm in to towns after the army has stopped shelling muscle man : emergence of the death squad pictures comes after @entity71 said yesterday he may have to send troops to @entity7 if the country spirals into a @entity75 - style civil war dr @entity76 , who runs the @entity77 from @entity78 but had treated some of the @entity34 in @entity80 , said recently : ' they were like monsters			1
' they had huge muscles , and big bellies and beards			0
they took steroids to pump up their bodies			0

if the @entity7 had the chance , he said , they would ' treat us the same way they treat their own people '			1
@entity7 has not declared its chemical weapons stocks so their exact size is not known			1
among other things , @entity97 is worried that such weapons could fall into the hands of anti-israel militants should the @entity7 regime crumble			2

@entity7 has strong ties to @entity135 , @entity97 's most fearsome enemy , and to @entity138 and @entity139 militants that have warred with @entity97			1
' that is what makes them so terrifying — the combination of strength and blind allegiance to the regime			0
' emergence of the death squad pictures comes after @entity71 said yesterday he may have to send troops to @entity7 if the country spirals into a @entity75 - style civil war			1
the foreign secretary said @entity153 would have to ' greatly increase our support for the opposition ' if the current @entity158 plan for a ceasefire fails , as his office now fears			0
mr @entity71 repeatedly refused to rule out military action yesterday if @entity7 descends into ' terrible ' sectarian violence			1
and he twice compared the violence raging in the @entity165 state to the conflict in @entity75 , where 12,000 @entity153 soldiers were eventually sent , rather than @entity168 , where the government resisted sending in ground troops			1

enforcers : film footage shows the ' ghosts ' walking out and about action man : pictured with guns , the ghost poses for this photograph but some diplomats believe the @entity213 will be compelled to act if the situation deteriorates and risks dragging in neighbouring countries such as @entity139 and @entity217			0

he said it would be hard to see how @entity135 could attend the conference - one of @entity253 's demands - as it had already given @entity7 technical support and advised the regime on how to suppress protests			1
instead , he said the way forward was to adopt the peace plan of former @entity158 secretary - general @entity266			2
