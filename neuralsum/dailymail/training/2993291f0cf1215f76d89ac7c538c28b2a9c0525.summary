shoppers walk through a @entity73 store in @entity74 , @entity75 ahead of @entity1 sales across the nation that could be what it takes to get shoppers to open their wallets for the holiday shopping season , which accounts for about 20 percent of annual retail sales			2
besides economic factors , people are becoming more discerning when they shop			2
armed with smartphones and price - comparison apps , they know what 's a good deal - and what 's not			2
@entity91 , 39 , of @entity92 , was among the @entity1 defectors			0
after four years of braving the crowds , the sales failed to lure him out this year			2
' i consider myself a smart shopper			0
and it 's not as alluring as it used to be , ' @entity91 said			0
' it 's a marketing tool , and i do n't want to be pulled into it			0
' he also said the frenzy pushed him to overspend , and he paid the price in january on his credit card statement			0
instead , he said he will look online monday , the online shopping day often called cyber monday			1
some who went shopping on @entity6 felt they were doing it against their will			1
@entity110 of @entity92 said she felt forced to shop on the holiday			0

one plus : shoppers were buying more for themselves , a sign of optimism			0

people get an early start on @entity1 shopping deals at a @entity140 in @entity141 , @entity142 , as many retailers stayed opened during the @entity6 celebrations ceos at @entity26 and @entity146 said they saw shoppers not just focusing on the doorbuster deals but throwing extra items in their carts			1
@entity28 's ceo @entity151 told @entity152 on friday that he 's hoping lower gas prices will help spending			2
' there 's reason to believe that confidence should continue to grow			0
