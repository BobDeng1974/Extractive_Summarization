the pit in @entity202 , which was the setting for the film @entity205 , closed in 1993 , with the loss of 1,400 jobs and it is one of the most deprived parts of the country			1

and as many found some admirable qualities in her years of political life , @entity134 found no positive achievements in her premiership			2
he claimed she was ' charged by negativity ' and said she ' closed ' rather than opened the doors for women as the first female pm			2
in a statement he said : ' @entity12 is remembered as @entity278 only because she possessed completely negative traits such as persistent stubbornness and a determined refusal to listen to others			0
