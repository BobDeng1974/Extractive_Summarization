by @entity1 reporter @entity2 : 02:19 est , 24 december 2013 @entity3 : 03:45 est , 24 december 2013 maybe it was getting his first video game , @entity5 , for @entity7 at the age of 12 , and then having to wait an entire year for the hard - to - land @entity10 console to play it on that made @entity14 so determined to get his hands on every video game and system he could find			1
now , 31 years and roughly 11,000 games later , @entity14 is the newly crowned world record holder for having the largest collection of video games			1
he is featured in a two - page spread in the just - released ' @entity23 '			2
' i have games on cartridge , laser disc			2
i have @entity29 - based games , cassette - based games , ' @entity14 said , standing among the collection that fills the basement of his suburban @entity33 home			1
the @entity34 verified that @entity14 has the largest collection of videogames in the world as of 2014 , with the count being 10,607 at the time			1
he now says he is approaching 12,000 unique games man cave or children 's playground ? this is a look at the basement where @entity14 ( left ) keeps his collection it took counters from the @entity34 days to get through @entity14 's games ' archive ' along with the games , he has the devices to play them on , not only the @entity52 and playstations but obscure ones like the @entity55 , the only game system specifically geared toward girls , which came out in @entity59 in 1995 , and the @entity60 , a dud released by @entity62 the same year			1
' every game on it is awful , ' @entity14 says of @entity62 's foray into the gaming world			1
' it 's the least fun of anything in the house			2
' at the other end of the spectrum is the old @entity10 unit like the one that appeared under the christmas tree one year after his grandparents gave him his first game for it			0
they had mistakenly believed his parents had gotten their hands on the playing system , which was a hot item that year			0
it stands to this day as the best present his parents ever gave him			0
' it 's my first love so it 's sentimental , ' @entity14 said			1
but the games also were quality , with very little of the ' shovelware ' - mediocre , rushed releases - typical of many systems , he said			2
' they looked good , they played good			0
for the time they sounded good , ' he said , ' for the bleeps and blips of the 80s			0
' @entity14 began collecting almost immediately , he said , but the path to the world record had a couple of restarts			2
@entity104 : this shelf is specifically for old school @entity107 consoles @entity14 estimates the collection is worth $ 700,000 - $ 800,000 he sold off his collection twice , first in 1989 to raise money for a @entity112 , then again to pay for his 1998 wedding			1
( ' i was heavy into collecting when we married so she knew what she was getting into , ' he says of his wife , @entity120 ) since then , @entity14 has methodically rebuilt the collection , averaging two games per day on a strict $ 3,000 - a - year budget which means never paying full price			1
he estimates the collection is worth $ 700,000 to $ 800,000			1
he has n't played every game			0
the father of a five - year - old , @entity127 , @entity14 designs games and teaches 2d animation , game design and the history of video games at @entity135 in @entity33			1
he also writes on the topic for magazines and books			0
' i probably get three hours of playing in a week , ' he said			0
' if i 'm lucky			0
' @entity23 lists the number of games in @entity14 's record - breaking collection at 10,607 , though he said the number exceeds 11,000 now , a year after the official count and after discovering forgotten stashes of games after the counting crew left			1
either way , it bested the previous record holder , @entity150 , who held the record first recorded in 2010 with 8,616 games			2
' my congratulations to a fellow collector , ' @entity154 , 39 , said by phone from his @entity159 home upon hearing his record had fallen			0
' it 's very impressive and i 'm very happy for him			0
' @entity154 began collecting as a way to own all the games he could n't have as a kid , he said , and grew to appreciate their place in pop culture			0
still an active collector , @entity154 has n't counted his games in the last few years and does n't know what his number has grown to , but he has no immediate plans to challenge @entity14 for his old record			1
' it 's something i did for my own enjoyment			0
i applied for the @entity23 book for my kids so that years from now they can look back and say , wow , my father was in the ` @entity34 , ' @entity154 , a father of two and numismatist , a rare coin dealer , said			2
he 's happy to see more people collecting , and appreciating , video games			1
' everything from the original artwork to the actual code that was written for the games to the actual box art and the whole marketing plan , ' he said			0
' it 's just a very undervalued and underappreciated art form			0

@entity14 has just made the new @entity34 2014 @entity193 for having the largest collection of video games
he estimates the cache , which he keeps in the basement of his @entity33 home , to be worth about $ 700,000 - $ 800,000
while there are many *favorite* 's , he says the worst of the bunch is the @entity60 , apple 's foray into games that was released in 1995
