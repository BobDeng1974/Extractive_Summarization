sen. @entity0 on thursday chided @entity2 leaders while on foreign travel in the @entity4 for refusing to describe @entity6 's occupation of the country as an ' invasion			1
' ' if we in the @entity11 can not say clearly that what [ @entity6 president ] @entity14 is doing to @entity4 constitutes an invasion of a sovereign country			1
then we are living in @entity14 's world , ' he remarked during a press conference in the country 's capitol city , @entity21			1
' just as an invasion is an invasion , our world either has rules , or it does not , ' he continued			2
@entity0 , a @entity25 , did not call out @entity27 president @entity26 by name in his statement but the @entity31 president is among the world leaders who have shied away from using the term ' invasion ' to characterize a deployment of 1,000 @entity6 troops to @entity4 last week			1
then we are living in @entity14 's world ' in a forceful speech delivered from @entity45 , a former @entity46 territory that now shares a border with @entity6 , president @entity26 told @entity49 leaders on wednesday that ‘ borders ca n’t be redrawn at the barrel of a gun ’ and the sovereignty of a country ' ca n't simply be taken away by brute force			1

in a joint op - ed with @entity64 prime minister @entity63 that was published today in @entity65 reiterated his dissatisfaction with @entity14 's actions			1
' @entity6 has ripped up the rulebook , ' @entity26 and @entity63 wrote			0
the @entity27 and @entity64 leaders have declined to define the @entity6 deployment as an ' invasion ' - even as a top @entity4 military official warned that it was just that - preferring instead to call it an ' incursion			2
' @entity26 administration officials have said it should n't matter how they describe the situation in the @entity4 , though			2
' whatever it is called , ' @entity80 spokeswoman @entity79 told @entity83 , ' it does n't change the options that where -- the @entity27 is considering , in conjunction with @entity87 , in conjunction with our counterparts around the world			0
' president @entity26 , left , and @entity64 prime minister @entity63 , right , are in @entity93 this week meeting with other members of the @entity96			1
neither @entity26 nor @entity63 have characterized @entity6 's deployment of 1,000 troops into @entity4 as an ' invasion ' sen. @entity0 traveled to @entity4 this week for the fourth time in the past year as president @entity26 and @entity87 heads of state met in @entity93 to discuss the crisis in @entity4 during a a two - day gathering of members of the @entity96			1
@entity0 , a member of the @entity106 , said in his statement he came back to besieged country ' because i believe what is happening in @entity4 is about far more than @entity4			0
' ' it is about the principles of international order that have brought peace and hope to @entity87 , and much of the world beyond @entity87 , since 1945 , ' he said , ' and whether a world based on these principles will endure or not			0
' the @entity120 lawmaker said that if @entity14 can invade a country ' for no reason other than greed , belligerence , and imperial ambition , what is to stop others from doing so ? ' ' if that principle does not apply in @entity4 , why should it apply anywhere else ? ' he added			1
@entity0 argued that @entity14 would n't have violated international norms if he did n't think he could get away with it			1
' the real provocation for @entity14 has been the perception of @entity2 weakness , ' he said			0
scroll down for more ' what should be clear is that @entity14 's appetite only grows with the eating , and he will keep taking more until he faces a consequence he is unwilling to incur			1
clearly we have not reached that point , and it is urgent that we do			0
' the elder statesman had already called on the @entity144 on sunday to provide weapons and intelligence to @entity4 so it can defend itself and he reiterated his support for military assistance today			0
he also claimed the @entity27 needs to place ' truly crushing sanctions ' on @entity6 if it wants to shut down @entity14 's offensive			2
' the horrors of the last century unfolded because good people too often failed to recognize what was at stake for them in the suffering of others , ' the five - term @entity151 and former prisoner of war cautioned			0
' if @entity87 and @entity27 and the civilized world do not recall that lesson now , and do more to help @entity4 in its hour of greatest need , the darkness in our world will only grow			0
' @entity0 is also the ranking member of the @entity166			0
@entity168 foreign relations chair @entity167 , a @entity169 , has been lobbying the @entity26 administration to provide more substantial assistance to @entity4 as well			0
' we should provide the @entity4 with the type of defensive weapons that will impose a cost upon @entity14 for further aggression , ' he said sunday on @entity83 's @entity178 news program .			2

@entity0 did not call president @entity26 out by name , but @entity26 is one of the world leaders refusing to describe the deployment as an ' invasion '
if we ' can not say clearly ' that what @entity14 is doing is an invasion , @entity0 said , ' then we are living in @entity14 's world '
the @entity25 lawmaker said that if the @entity11 did n't stop @entity14 , the leaders of other countries *emboldened* to invade sovereign territories
