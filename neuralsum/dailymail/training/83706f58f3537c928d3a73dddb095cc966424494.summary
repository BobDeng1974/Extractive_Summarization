by @entity0 the @entity1 once enjoyed the hospitality of the finest hotels in the world			1
among his favourites was the @entity8 boutique hotel in @entity9			2
on his blog , the @entity11 , he advised readers : ‘ @entity14 insist on @entity16 champagne			1
two bottles by the rooftop pool at the @entity8 in @entity9 is highly recommended for good living			2
’ the @entity20 also enjoyed some agreeable stays at the @entity22 and @entity23 in @entity24 , where he noted that staff ‘ served the most beautiful spring tea to the @entity27 and i in the room ’			2
@entity31 aka @entity1 , lived a life of luxury at the expense of his in - laws after convincing them he was a @entity37 deprived of his birthright indeed , wherever he went , @entity39 was treated with the reverence due a member of an obscure but noble family in @entity43 in @entity44			1
he was , to borrow a description of him by his admiring father - in - law , a ‘ most noble fellow ’			1
except he was n’t a nobleman at all , but a conman previously known rather less exotically as @entity31			1
he persuaded his mother - in - law and his wife ’s uncle to invest hundreds of thousands of pounds in a number of phoney business ventures			1
in a blog post the @entity54 claimed that @entity16 champagne , which sells for £ 300 a bottle , was his favourite their money was placed in an offshore account called @entity61			1
@entity63 ’s breaks at luxury hotels in the @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity44 — and his favourite @entity16 champagne , which retails at £ 299.95 a bottle — were paid for with this money			1
this month , 46 - year - old @entity31 began a 40 - month jail sentence for his fraud			1
his crimes have been uncovered but one mystery remains : how on earth did he get away with it ? let us consider for a moment what image is conjured up when one thinks of a @entity43 viscount			2
a tall , dashing figure with a dangerous glint in his eye and an air of the rake about him ? yet in the dock at @entity87 stood an overweight , balding bloke with a goatee beard and a tie as dodgy as his title			2
presumably he must have been a very convincing storyteller			2
the @entity20 ’s tale was that he was a member of a @entity43 dynasty whose lands in @entity1 along the @entity98 coast had been confiscated during the communist era			1
the family had fled to @entity101 and , when he was old enough , he claimed he left home and moved to @entity103 , where he studied at the @entity104			1
from there , he travelled to @entity106			2
at some point , he changed his name by deed poll , using the @entity110 instead of @entity54 as a nod to his sojourn in @entity103			2
no one seemed to consider how odd it was for a @entity43 nobleman to have a @entity110 title , a @entity118 name and speak with a @entity101 accent			0
in @entity106 , the @entity20 met his wife - to - be , a pretty @entity122 - born blonde called @entity123 , then 27 and working as a personal assistant			1
deprived of his birthright , the @entity20 had to settle on marrying his bride at @entity128 register office and moving into a flat in @entity130 , @entity106 , and later to another flat in @entity132 , an equally incongruous location for a @entity43 nobleman			1
in 2009 , the couple moved to @entity136			0
on his marriage certificate , the @entity20 was named as one @entity138			0
he gave his occupation as restaurant consultant ( he was later to tell friends he had once been a @entity142 - starred chef )			1
his father was named on the document as @entity145 , a chief executive officer			0
how he managed to explain to his university - educated wife that his late father was not also a @entity138 or a @entity39 , or whatever , is a mystery			1
@entity31 recommended ordering a bottle or two of the bubbly while on the terrace of the @entity8 hotel in @entity9 ( pictured ) the @entity156 told @entity123 that the @entity157 had managed to keep much of their fortune out of the communists ’ hands — and one day , he promised , it would all be theirs			1
for the first few years of the marriage , it is not clear what the @entity20 did for work			0
after all , that is the prerogative of the highly born , is it not ? presumably , the @entity27 had to go out to work			0
@entity123 ’s family were rather in awe of the nobleman their daughter had married			0
in a note to him written in january 2010 , his father - in - law , @entity175 , began with the words : ‘ most noble fellow , @entity138			1
’ it was around this time that the @entity156 told his wife ’s family that a £ 400 million inheritance would be coming his way soon			1
in anticipation of this happy event , the @entity20 instructed @entity185 , the property expert on @entity188 ’s programme @entity186 and @entity190 ’s sidekick , to find him a nice @entity106 house			0
‘ i wasted a lot of time on him , ’ recalls mr @entity185			0
‘ we went to view a £ 14 million house in @entity198 and he was talking about where the servants would live and where the @entity201 would go			1
' there were lots of discussions , but it came to nothing			0
i refused to put an offer in on the property until i was reassured all the finances were in place , but that did n’t happen			0
‘ he was very plausible — a very pleasant man — and a terrible name dropper			0
he said he knew @entity216 and @entity217			0
the @entity20 also boasted to friends of his plans to buy a private jet to make travelling less onerous			1
@entity31 even went so far as to contact tv estate agent @entity185 to buy a £ 14million house in @entity198 which he claimed could be bought with a £ 400million inheritance windfall then he began discussing a number of business ventures with his in - laws			1
he spoke to his wife ’s uncle , @entity226 , a high - profile @entity122 who helped coordinate the opening ceremonies for the @entity230 and @entity229			1
the @entity20 offered to invest some of the money from his ‘ inheritance ’ in a new company to be set up between himself and mr @entity226			1
first , though , he asked for £ 50,000 from mr @entity226 to give him preference shares in the company			1
the @entity156 also told mr @entity226 he had control of a shipping container company based in the @entity237 and asked him for £ 56,000 to buy new containers			1
then he asked mr @entity239 to hand over a further £ 10,000 to be used in a venture with a fictitious @entity242 stockbroker			1
the @entity20 also persuaded his wife ’s mother , @entity243 , to part with £ 150,000 to invest in the same shipping container business			1
as we know , much of this money funded the @entity20 ’s holidays and meals at expensive restaurants			2
as well as fine dining , @entity39 said he also had ambitions to become a novelist , and needed cash to set up a company to publish a book			0
in june 2010 , @entity258 was born and in 2011 his debut novel , the @entity98 , came out under the name vp von @entity39			0
in an interview on a book review blog , he said the inspiration for @entity98 was ‘ based on my own family ’s struggle to get back what was rightfully ours prior to the communist takeover of @entity43 ’			0
but by now this elaborate web of deceit was beginning to unravel			0
mr @entity226 and mrs @entity123 , concerned that the schemes they had invested in were not making any returns , had begun asking questions			0
despite their expensive lifestyle @entity31 and his wife @entity123 lived in a flat in @entity132 before moving to @entity136 ( file picture ) to allay their fears , @entity39 sent them faked bank statements			1
he then told mr @entity226 that one of his employees had emptied the contents of his bank account and donated them to the @entity288			2
this was an absurdity too far			0
it is believed that at this point mr @entity226 alerted the police			0
after the arrest , he moved to a flat in @entity296 , @entity297			0
in the past month or so he has been seen out and about in the town sporting a floppy leather hat with a feather in it			2
on his arm at a local restaurant recently was a woman with dark hair with purple streaks in it			0
she told staff it was ‘ one of her first dates ’ with him			2
unsurprisingly , it seems the @entity20 ’s marriage to @entity314 , the ‘ @entity27 ’ has collapsed and this week she could not be traced			0
last month , @entity39 ’s case was heard at @entity316 and moved to @entity87 for sentencing			2
the court heard that his mother - in - law , @entity243 , a 68 - year - old grandmother who lives in @entity319 , @entity320 , has been forced to return to work as a primary school supply teacher to pay off her debts			2
giving evidence , she said : ‘ i treated him as a son			0
it was not just that he was a friend to me , he was family , and that ’s why i did n’t question his investing my money for me			1
‘ i probably came close to a nervous breakdown			0
i was very foolish and trusting			0
these were my life savings			0
he seemed very calm and said , “ i ’m sorry , i ’m a congenital liar , it ’s like a gambling addiction			0
” ’ @entity63 , wearing black jeans and a tatty black coat , pleaded guilty to four counts of fraud by false representation			2
he listened intently to the proceedings , but remained impassive throughout			0
just a few days earlier , he had eaten out at a restaurant in @entity296			0
instead of his ‘ @entity20 ’ title , he made the reservation under the name of @entity31 — the game , he knew , was up .			1

@entity31 , 46 , has started a 40 month jail sentence for fraud
he posed as @entity1 , a @entity37
claimed to have been deprived of his birthright by communists
told in - laws he was investing their money for them while actually stealing it
used it to buy £ 300 champagne and stay in luxury hotels
