' it ’s really powerful to see yourself randomly in that way			0
' identity parade : ' the " jock " on the left is my uncle ! number 62			0
, ' @entity116 from @entity117 wrote while he has confirmed some of the subjects , he says that most times people mistakenly see themselves			1
indeed , one woman wrote on @entity88 : ' can u plz [ sic ] tell me what mall this taken in if you remember , i think this is me			0
i worked at the ice cream shop in the mall during the late 80s early 90s - this was a really popular look so i understand it may not be me			0

' mr @entity0 , who is now a photographer , musician and award - winning filmmaker , was just 20 when he began driving across the @entity12 in 1989 , capturing pictures from shopping malls in different states for a college art project			1
in an extract from his book , he writes that his college photography teacher at @entity172 encouraged him to travel across the country after she saw photos he had taken at the local mall in @entity176 , @entity177			1
in 1989 , he embarked on a road trip to the @entity179 with a friend , and by the time they got to @entity183 they had visited over a dozen malls and even more thrift stores and antique shops			1
while the tiled floors , artificial plants and brightly - lit stores are recognizable features of malls to this day , the customers ' hairstyles and fashion reveal the era these photos were taken in			2
do you know who this is ? one woman thought this was her in the photo but the location of the mall did n't match up to the ice cream parlor where she used to work mr @entity0 told @entity41 in 2011 that the time period is just as significant as the physical setting of his photos			0
' at the time , the mall was the new public space , the new community center where people would interact			0
' it was surreal to walk around - even the " restaurants " in the food court were the same			0
this was @entity12 ' ' this was pre-internet , pre-cellphone , there was smoking in malls , it was before the @entity222			1
it was this weird moment in time where things were getting ready to change			0
' indeed , one of the most noticeable aspects of the images is their lack of cell phones , @entity231 and other technology that play such a large role in our lives today			2
another detail that reveals these photos are relics from the past is that several of the subjects are smoking inside the mall			0
in one such photo , a woman perches on a sofa puffing on a cigarette while children play by a water feature in a shopping mall lobby			2
are you in there ? malls across @entity12 hit book stores last month the signs for shops like @entity255 and @entity256 also reveal a bygone era , as do the boxy television sets being sold at one of the stores			1
mr @entity0 says one of the ground - breaking moments on his road trip was when he visited a mall in @entity265 , @entity266 , and he realized it was identical to one he had been to in @entity268 , @entity269			0
' it was a completely surreal experience to walk around that space , ’ he says			0
' even the " restaurants " in the food court were the same			0
' mr @entity0 launched a @entity276 campaign in 2011 in order to raise money to publish his book of photos			2
he explained on his @entity276 page that while he had no idea the images would spark such an interest today , part of their intrigue is the mystery of where each photo was captured			2
' it was hard to tell from the images where they were taken , and that was kind of the point , ' he writes			2
' i was interested in the creeping loss of regional differences			0
' malls across @entity12 , published by @entity300 , hit shelves and @entity302 last month			1

@entity304 from @entity14 , @entity117 , was just 20 when he began driving across the @entity12 in 1989 , capturing pictures from shopping malls in different states for a college art project
