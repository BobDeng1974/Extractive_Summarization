@entity1 boss @entity0 has challenged his players to take a leaf out of the books of @entity5 and @entity6 as they attempt to establish themselves on the international stage			1
the @entity8 won admirers at the @entity11 finals in @entity12 as they came close to dumping @entity13 out of the competition and making it to the quarter - finals , a feat which attracted unprecedented support for the game back at home			1
however , @entity0 admits the emotional toll on the men who fought so valiantly for the nation has been significant since , and that is the biggest lesson they have to learn as they continue their education			2
@entity1 boss @entity0 wants his players to take a leaf out of the superstars ' book he said : ' i was asked how to do handle the roster coming out of the @entity11 with all the emotional things that happened in our country and get these players back on track			1
it is not easy for these young people , but it is also now a tremendous learning experience			0
' you see @entity5 and @entity6 - they have three weeks ' vacation , they go back to their club teams and they rock the boat , they play like they did n't go on vacation			1
' our players , they went on vacation , they had a good time , they came back and they lost their spots at their clubs , or other players went back and because it was a six - to eight - week marathon that they went through , a very emotional marathon , they could n't keep it up			1
' they could n't keep it to the highest level and the air is out for quite a while			0
' @entity65 ( centre ) is mobbed by his team - mates after scoring @entity69 's fourth goal late on in the contest @entity71 ( right ) celebrates after his 39th - minute equaliser in @entity73 against @entity74 @entity0 's comments came after tuesday night 's 4 - 1 friendly defeat by the @entity74 in @entity73 , a game in which he tested the depth of his squad with goalkeeper @entity81 rested and @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 and @entity85 having been released ahead of vital @entity87 play - off fixtures			1
the @entity88 enjoyed the better of the first half despite falling behind to @entity91 's seventh - minute opener and levelled before half - time through @entity71			0
however , a @entity65 double either side of substitute @entity95 's deflected 82nd - minute strike condemned them to a defeat which extended their run to one win in five matches since their summer heroics			0
@entity0 was understandably disappointed by the result , but insisted the experience of recent months would ultimately serve his players well			2
he said : ' it 's a good learning curve			0
is it fun ? no , but we 'll deal with it			0
@entity5 and @entity6 embrace ahead of their meeting at @entity112 on tuesday ' the main objective this year was obviously the @entity11			1
it was all about the @entity11 and i think we did a good job overall			2
' after the @entity11 , this is the time now to bring the youngsters in , to bring a new wave in and to see what they can do , and you do it obviously at the cost of some results			2
' also the learning curve - i mentioned that after the last two games - is also that they have to learn emotionally how to digest a @entity11 , and a lot of our players really had big problems digesting those extreme emotions			1
' they dropped 20 , 30 , even 40 per cent in performances in their club environment			0
many of the @entity137 [ players at clubs in @entity139 ] lost their starting spot , many other players in @entity87 or whatever went down 30 , 40 per cent in their performances			2
' this is because they did n't know how to deal with all these emotions and all that recognition and all the compliments in the world that came after the @entity11 , and in a certain way , it 's human , it 's understandable			0
' you have got to look at the bigger picture right now , even if you are disappointed			0
