prosecutors are considering taking action over footage which shows a hunt follower 's horse ' mowing down a anti-hunt protestor ' , in an incident which left the alleged victim with seven broken ribs			1
@entity9 was trampled by the galloping horse while she attended the @entity11 and @entity13 meet in @entity14 last august			1
the 43 - year - old suffered a collapsed lung and shattered ribs and was left unconscious on the ground following the dramatic incident			1
the @entity40 said there was ' insufficient evidence that the incident could have been foreseen '			1
mr @entity38 had initially rode away from the scene but later voluntarily handed himself in at a police station			1
but the organisation is now reviewing the footage , after 12,000 people signed a petition urging the organisation to reconsider charging the rider			1
the review is taking place under the @entity54 , a process brought into force in 2013			1
it allows victims to appeal against a decision not to bring charges or to discontinue a case once a prosecution has begun			0
the @entity40 said : ' we are in communication with the alleged victim and will be in contact with her when we have made a decision			1
' the hunt insists the rider is innocent			1
the injured woman , who has asked to use a pseudonym because she fears being targeted by pro-hunting groups , said she was left ' devastated ' by the @entity40 's original decision			1
she said : ' i 'm a victim of crime and feel absolutely abandoned by a system that 's supposed to protect me			0
' as i lay in hospital the only thing on my mind was " have they got this on video ? " because i wanted to ensure it was looked at properly			0
i thought it was irrefutable evidence , the fact it was caught on video			2
' the organisation is now reviewing the footage ( above ) , after 12,000 people signed a petition urging the organisation to reconsider charging the rider the woman is seen being trampled as she stands with two fellow protestors at the meet in august ms @entity9 , who works full - time as an @entity98 health worker , had been at the meet at @entity100 near @entity101 , close to the @entity103 - @entity14 border , with colleagues from the @entity106 group when the incident occurred			1
she said she started ' sabbing ' – a term used to describe hunt saboteurs protesting at fox hunts – in the aftermath of the badger cull			2
saboteurs attended the planned hunt in a bid to raise awareness of animal cruelty and used two main tactics to throw the hunt off course			2
she said : ' we sounded a horn , hollered , and some hounds looked up and started to come our way			0
the @entity40 said no charges were brought because there was ' insufficient evidence that the incident could have been foreseen ' the man did not stop after the collision but later handed himself in to police , who charged him with @entity133 ' i think he [ the hunt member ] got angry at this			1
he came along a public road behind us at speed , he did n't issue a warning , he was completely silent , then he hit me and rode off			0
' as i was lay there , struggling to breathe , i could hear the horns going and i was worried that if the horses came back that i would be trampled to death			0
i was left lying there with potential life - threatening injuries			1
' ms @entity9 , from @entity147 , was taken to @entity148 where she stayed for two weeks			1
she added : ' he rode his horse at us at full speed and rode off			0
i had my back to him and he hit me and the horse 's chest contacted with my rib cage , breaking seven ribs , injuring my shoulder and i was unconscious			0
' when ribs are broken you ca n't splint them - they have to move			2
they have healed in a grossly displaced position			0
' the master of the @entity11 and @entity166 , @entity167 , said : ' we apologise that an awful accident happened but the due process of the law has been gone through			0
' @entity38 is innocent , as found by the @entity40			1
' a fox hunter who took a tumble from his horse was given first aid by a hunt saboteur			2
the anti-hunt campaigner put his differences to one side to come to the aid of the injured huntsmember , who lost consciousness after a nasty fall from his horse			0
@entity185 , a hunt master of the @entity186 , @entity187 and west @entity189 @entity188 , is believed to have been injured after his horse fell and rolled on top of him during a meet on saturday near @entity193 , @entity189			2
a fox hunter who took a tumble from his horse was given first aid by a hunt saboteur at a meet in @entity189 a member of @entity201 saboteurs , also a trained paramedic , stepped in and helped the injured man until other paramedics arrived			1
@entity204 , spokesperson for the @entity205 , said : ' well done to the sab who put his differences aside to act so compassionately , even in the face of hostility from the injured huntsmember			0
' his actions prove once again that saboteurs are compassionate not only towards animals but humans as well			0
' this is another nail in the coffin of the @entity216 's campaign to portray us in a negative light and it would be interesting to see what would have happened if the roles had been reversed			0
' a spokesman for @entity222 said : ' officers attended @entity224 to ensure public safety on saturday morning after receiving a report of a hunt demonstration			2
the anti-hunt campaigner put his differences to one side to come to the aid of the injured huntsmember , who lost consciousness after a nasty fall from his horse in @entity235 ' however , no offences were reported so no further action was necessary			0
' while in attendance , a man required medical attention after falling from a horse and was treated at the scene by a first - aider			1
' @entity244 , spokesman for the @entity216 said : ' just as hunting attracts a wide variety of people it is only common sense that not every person who sabs hunts is the same			0
the relationship between hunts and sabs varies from hunt to hunt and is not always acrimonious			2
i have heard stories of unsuitable attired antis being helped across muddy fields by gallant hunt supporters and broken down sab vehicles being towed out by helpful farmers			2
' however just because those opposed to hunting can boast that on this occasion one of their number showed human compassion it does not diminish the appalling behaviour of others , for example the cowardly gang of masked thugs who beat @entity276 huntsmember @entity274 with metal bars in january			0
' the number of people involved in saboteur activities is far fewer than in the past , however we are concerned that those extremists who remain are increasingly resorting to violence			0
