by @entity0 last updated at 4:58 pm on 4th january 2012 there was double humiliation at @entity7 's final football game of the season , after one student dressed up as anti-paedophile mascot ' @entity2 ' to protest at the sex scandal cover up at the college			1
the unknown fan dressed in the provocative outfit during @entity7 's 30 - 14 defeat in the @entity13 in @entity14 , @entity15 , and carried a sign that read : ' keep quiet and do n't tell anyone			1
' the game between the @entity19 and @entity20 at the @entity22 stadium was taking place without @entity7 's long - serving coach , @entity24 , who was sacked in november over the @entity26 sex scandal			1
scandal : @entity26 denies more than 50 charges of alleged abuse of young boys			1
right , @entity7 head coach @entity24 was sacked after it emerged he had failed to act on warnings about possible abuse charges : last month @entity26 , pictured with wife @entity35 , waived his right to a preliminary hearing @entity26 , assistant coach to @entity24 for 30 years , faces more than 50 child sex - abuse charges over decades of alleged abuse of young boys			1
wearing the costume was apparently the idea of a @entity42 fan , furious at the apparent cover up of @entity26 's alleged abuse			1
a user on the university 's sports message board , @entity48 , wrote : ' the conspiracy undertaken by the staff and administrators of the @entity52 to cover up the rape of children so as not to damage its precious football program is shameful			2
' for a decade , @entity7 employees , agents , trustees and officers - from the janitor to the president of the university all the way up to the @entity63 - knew that @entity26 was raping children , and doing so on @entity7 property			2
' message : the fan was wearing a bear suit in reference to this internet meme - ' paedobear '			0
originally it was used to signify illegal pornography , but is now used to signify paedophilia @entity26 has said he is innocent of more than 50 charges stemming from alleged sexual assaults over 15 years on 10 boys at his home , on @entity7 property and elsewhere			1
the scandal prompted the sacking of @entity82 football coach @entity24 and the school 's long - time president , @entity83			2
former athletic director @entity85 and vice president @entity86 also face charges of perjury and failure to report a crime			2
the appearance of the ' @entity92 ' is the latest blow to the college since the scandal erupted last year			0
last month , @entity26 waived his right to a preliminary hearing just before the first witness was due to testify against him in a @entity100 courtroom			0
the 67 - year - old said : ' we fully intend to put together the best possible defence and stay the course for four full quarters			0
' his attorney , @entity106 , then told reporters if they believed claims against his client they should call 1 - 800 - reality - the number of a gay - sex phone service			0
and another of his lawyers , @entity114 , claimed he had showered with boys from his @entity117 charity to ' teach them basic hygiene skills '			0
the image of the ' @entity92 ' is apparently used as a signal in online message boards that illegal pornographic images have been posted , although not necessarily paedophilia			0
it has since been used to indicate the existence of child pornography or to mock paedophiles and draw attention to their actions .			0
