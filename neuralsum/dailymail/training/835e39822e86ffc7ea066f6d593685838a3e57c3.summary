by @entity1 reporter one in ten inspectors working for the @entity4 watchdog was hired despite not being up to the job			0
the @entity6 has admitted that 126 of its staff were recruited through a ‘ flawed ’ process			1
they were taken on during a major recruitment drive in 2012 prompted by accusations that the watchdog was failing in its duty to carry out rigorous checks of hospitals and care homes			1
one in ten inspectors working for the @entity4 watchdog was hired despite not being up to the job , a new report reveals ( file picture ) but the @entity6 has since discovered that during those 12 months the pass rate was lowered and candidates were hired despite under - performing in key assessments			1
the flaw only came to light in march during a review of the recruitment process , which was prompted by the concerns of other staff			1
but the watchdog says it can not sack the inspectors in case they sue for unfair dismissal			0
the disclosure is the latest blow for the @entity6 , which has been dogged by scandal since it was set up in 2009 to inspect hospitals , care homes and gp services			1
the poor recruitment was uncovered by the @entity39 , which obtained the review of the process under freedom of information laws			1
it states that during 2012 a total of 134 candidates were appointed as inspectors even though they were subsequently found not to have met certain ‘ benchmarks ’			2
a total of 126 remain among the 1,031 full - time inspectors , for whom the starting salary is £ 38,000			2
the document adds that throughout 2012 , there was a ‘ flawed recruitment process ’ that resulted in a ‘ lowering of the passrate ’ of certain assessments			1
it involved a single assessment day that led to ‘ a significant number of people in post who were not recruited to the required standard ’			0
the review admitted that staff were appointed without ‘ the core competencies to do the job properly ’			2
the @entity6 says it can not get rid of these inspectors as they were unaware of the flawed recruitment process and so could sue for unfair dismissal			1
it is drastically trying to overhaul its reputation and in 2012 appointed a new chief executive and chairman			0
they replaced @entity72 and @entity73 , who were accused of conspiring to cover - up a botched inspection of a maternity unit at @entity76 , where poor care contributed to the deaths of mothers and babies			0
@entity76 , where poor care contributed to the deaths of mothers and babies @entity82 , a former inspector who resigned last year after repeatedly raising concerns over staff to senior managers at the @entity6 , told the @entity86 that there were still people ‘ at risk ’ in the healthcare sector			2
‘ the cqc keeps promising that it has changed but this shows it is still putting the public at risk			0
‘ to have 126 inspectors who are in charge of regulating hospitals and care homes who do not meet basic standards is shocking			2
this means staff who wo n’t be able to identify risks to patients and care home residents , who do n’t have experience of the sector , who are simply substandard			0
‘ the only way it ’s ever going to work is if @entity110 abolishes it and starts again			0
’ @entity6 chief executive @entity112 said the recruitment process was now much more rigorous and took place over five days			1
‘ we now recruit people with specialist experience in healthcare , primary medical services and adult social care			0
‘ all of our inspection staff , regardless of when they were appointed , receive training , are subject to regular performance management reviews , and their work is quality assured			0
