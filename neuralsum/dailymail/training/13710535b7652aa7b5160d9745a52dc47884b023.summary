by @entity0 retired scientist @entity1 , pictured , has been accused of being less than totally honest about his credentials as a shale gas expert anti-fracking campaigners describe him as ‘ a world - class star of geological research ’ , but @entity1 was accused today of being less than totally honest about his credentials as a shale gas expert			1
the retired geologist and former punk rock guitarist has been prominent in highlighting the dangers of fracking and last week helped to persuade a county council to reject an application to drill an exploratory shale well			1
but a professor at his old university now accuses him of ‘ pseudo-scientific scaremongering ’			1
the @entity18 has also written to mr @entity1 – who has the title ‘ @entity21 , @entity22 ’ – demanding that he stops claiming to be a chartered geologist			1
@entity22 , where he last worked in 1998 , has told him he must not suggest that its academics share his views			0
and prof @entity25 , @entity26 ’s professor of energy engineering , said mr @entity1 – who played bass guitar in the 70s punk band @entity29 – was unqualified to give expert evidence on fracking , having retired 16 years ago			1
’ he has published nothing on ( shale gas ) in any proper scientific forum – no doubt because he knows he would never get past peer review with his pseudo-scientific scaremongering			1
’ but mr @entity1 , 67 , who now lives in the @entity38 , hit back saying he could find no publications on fracking by @entity41 , adding : ‘ so you could say he is no more an expert than me			1
’ in recent months mr @entity1 – who was head of @entity44 at @entity26 from 1988 until the department was closed in 1998 – has warned of the potentially serious environmental damage that fracking poses , including a huge risk of water contamination			2
last week he helped to persuade @entity50 to reject an application by @entity52 to explore for shale oil , describing its application as ‘ incomplete , incompetent and disingenuous			0
he has also given evidence on behalf of campaigners against a subterranean methane project involving drilling 22 bore holes 800 metres deep into the @entity60 countryside			0
mr @entity1 suggested the process of removing the gas could result in earthquakes becoming more likely in the area and potential contamination of streams and rivers , posing a threat to human health			2
in a recent newspaper interview professor @entity25 said : ’ he falsely claims to be a chartered geologist			2
‘ i am concerned about the damage to the reputation of the university by someone who never fails to use his university affiliation			0
’ professor @entity81 , president of the @entity18 , wrote last month to mr @entity1 telling him not to use the title ‘ chartered geologist			1
’ the governing body of @entity22 also wrote to him saying : ' notwithstanding our support for freedom of expression , we respectfully request that you make it clear in all of your future publications and broadcast media appearances that the views which you hold and express are your own and are not necessarily representative of the views held by the university ’s researchers			0
' @entity1 has given evidence on behalf of anti-fracking campaigns and claims to have done extensive research into unconventional energy extraction mr @entity1 , who believes he may be an illegitimate descendant of @entity103 , admitted that he should not have claimed to be a chartered geologist but said that it was a ‘ completely trivial matter ’ because he had been one once but had stopped paying his subscription in 1996			1
but a spokeswoman for the @entity18 said that the title required proof of ‘ continuous professional development ’ , not just payment of a subscription			2
mr @entity1 , who lives in the @entity113 and rents out a self - catering apartment in his mansion overlooking the @entity116 , insists he had done extensive research into unconventional energy extraction			1
he said professor @entity25 sent him a ‘ very abusive email ’ after he appeared on a recent radio programme in @entity118 ‘ accusing me of arm - waving and talking nonsense			0
’ mr @entity1 , whose 1970s punk band had its biggest success with a cover version of the @entity126 song ‘ somebody ’s @entity127 ’ added : ’ you could say it is sour grapes			2
’ the @entity22 confirmed mr @entity1 has right to use the title ‘ emeritus professor ’ and the retired scientist said he had never suggested that his views were shared by the university			1
‘ a lot of @entity139 academics have in effect been bought off by the oil industry			0
they depend on grants from that industry so they dare not speak out critically , ’ he said			0
‘ i write reports [ on fracking ] for public inquiries to a very high standard because my aim is that i ’m providing all the evidence if any such inquiry decision were to go to judicial review			0
’ mr @entity1 is advising @entity154 , a group opposing fracking in the @entity157 national park			2
@entity158 , one of the campaigners from the group , said : ’ none of this stops him from doing his job , he is still a geologist			0
‘ as regards the university , he has always said that it is his own opinion that he states			0
‘ i am not a geologist but as far as i am concerned , what he has said so far makes common sense			0
