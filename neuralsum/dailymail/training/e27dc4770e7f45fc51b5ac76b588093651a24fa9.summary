by @entity0 published : 12:06 est , 23 september 2013 updated : 13:19 est , 23 september 2013 the referendum on whether @entity2 should leave the @entity3 is still a year away - but a group of craftsmen have already started the job of dividing @entity7 from its northern neighbour			1
four dryliners from @entity10 are helping to rebuild parts of @entity12 , which was erected by the @entity13 to keep the ' barbarian ' inhabitants of @entity2 out of ' civilised ' @entity7			1
the project is intended as a way of protecting the ancient stone wall - but one of the workers jokes that they may have to reinforce the barrier with concrete if the referendum is successful in splitting up @entity3			1
restoration : craftsman @entity25 pictured helping to rebuild @entity12 in northern @entity3 historic : the workers , including @entity28 , are using the original @entity13 stone to repair weaker sections collaboration : the local experts have resorted to old - fashioned techniques to reinforce the monument @entity12 was built in the 2nd century ad and manned by @entity13 soldiers , who wanted to protect their @entity3 territory from the @entity38 who lived in what is now @entity2			1
ever since the @entity41 in 1707 , the wall has run across the middle of the @entity3 - but after next year 's referendum , it could become an international border once again			1
every inhabitant of @entity2 will be asked to vote on the question , ' should @entity2 be an independent country ? ' on september 18 next year			2
most polls suggest that the referendum question is likely to be rejected , but if it succeeds it will fundamentally change the landscape of @entity3			0
friendly : @entity28 and @entity51 set to work replacing sections of the wall which have weakened history : but some have joked that the wall could divide @entity7 and @entity2 if the @entity3 breaks up next year atmospheric : the wall runs for more than 80 miles across the hills of northern @entity3 the four dryliners who are rebuilding @entity12 are more interested in contributing to history than arguing about politics , however			1
@entity28 , @entity51 , @entity25 and @entity63 are taking original @entity13 stone from stronger sections of the wall in order to reinforce the weaker sections			1
they are shifting 10 tonnes of stone every day as part of the £ 500,000 project , which was commissioned by the @entity73 and will continue until the end of next month			1
heavy duty : the workers are moving 10 tonnes of ancient stone every ay as part of the project hard at work : the £ 500,000 project is due to continue until the end of next month @entity12 takes its name from the @entity82 , who ruled over the @entity13 at the time the fortification was first constructed in 122 ad			1
the wall stretches across northern @entity3 from the @entity85 in the east to the @entity87 in the west , roughly dividing the territory of the @entity13 from that of the @entity38			2
the vast majority of the wall is now in @entity7 , suggesting that the border between the two countries has shifted north since ancient times			2
it was dotted with fortified towers which would have provided the bases for @entity13 soldiers defending the territory and inhabitants of their empire			0
although much of @entity12 is now in a state of relative disrepair , it is still a notable landmark in the region and is popular among hikers walking its 84 - mile length			0
' this is a really enjoyable job , ' mr @entity25 said			0
' to think you 're working with stone somebody put in 2,000 years ago			0
and leaving something at the end of the day that 'll be there in 200 to 300 years - there 's not many jobs that are like that			0
' it 's about picking the right stone to go in the right place			0
you 've got to look for the one that 's going to fit			0
it 's a big jigsaw			0
' @entity129 , from the @entity73 , said : ' by repairing the dry stone wall we 're protecting the @entity13 wall underneath			2
' the wall was built to separate @entity13 and barbarians			0
the wall is still used as a boundary - but now it 's between fields rather than @entity13 and barbarians			2
' mr @entity129 also joked that it might be time to rebuild the wall entirely if the independence referendum drives @entity7 and @entity2 apart			1
' a local civil engineering firm was asked to calculate the cost of a wall made of concrete , ' he said			0
' it was £ 80million at 1974 prices - maybe we should think about it if there is a " yes " vote for @entity2 independence next year ? '			2
