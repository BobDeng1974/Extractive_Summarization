the @entity1 's orbiting telescope has captured striking new images of the huge ' doomsday ' asteroid @entity4 that could smash into @entity5 in 2036 - revealing it is larger than previously thought			1
long billed as a potential cause of an @entity9 ( @entity9 ) for humanity , today @entity1 officials announced that its @entity11 discovered that the asteroid is 1,066 feet wide , 20 percent larger than the previous estimate of 885 feet			2
whizzing past @entity5 at the relatively close distance of nine million miles tonight , @entity4 is being closely tracked because of a 2004 study that predicted the rock has a 2.7 percent chance of hitting @entity5 in april 2029 , which was later revised to 2036			1
@entity20 @entity11 captured asteroid @entity4 in its field of view during the approach to @entity5 on january , 5 - 6 , 2013			1
this image shows the asteroid in @entity26 three pacs wavelengths : 70 , 100 and 160 microns ' the 20 percent increase in diameter … translates into a 75 percent increase in our estimates of the asteroid 's volume or mass , ' study leader @entity27 of the @entity28 in @entity29 , @entity30 , said in a statement			1
in addition to the latest findings two free webcasts will stream live views of the asteroid as it passes , filmed from telescopes in @entity47 and the @entity48			0
the video streams from @entity50 and @entity51 will show @entity4 as a moving light streaking across the sky - although scientists have said that sadly the large space rock is too small to be seen through home telescopes			0
' alone among all these near - @entity5 asteroids that have passed our way in recent years , @entity4 has generated the most concern worldwide because of its extremely close approach in 2029 and [ chances of a ] potential impact , albeit small , in 2036 , ' said @entity65 president @entity64			1
indeed , while scientists have ruled out any possibility of a cataclysmic collision - there remains a very real chance of the asteroid @entity4 smashing into @entity5 in 2036			1
' @entity4 has been one of those celestial bodies that has captured the public 's interest since it was discovered in 2004 , ' said @entity73 at @entity75 's @entity74 in @entity76 , @entity77			0
jan. 8 , 2013 : at about 36 hours from the minimum distance ( 9.3 million miles from @entity5 ) , potentially hazardous asteroid @entity4 was imaged again with the @entity51 ' updated computational techniques and newly available data indicate the probability of an @entity5 encounter on april 13 , 2036 , for @entity4 has dropped from one - in - 45,000 to about four - in - a million			1
' the science of predicting asteroid orbits is based on a physical model of the solar system which includes the gravitational influence of the sun , moon , other planets and the three largest asteroids			0
@entity75 detects and tracks asteroids and comets passing close to @entity5 using both ground and space - based telescopes			2
the @entity97 , commonly called ' @entity98 , ' discovers these objects , characterizes a subset of them and plots their orbits to determine if any could be potentially hazardous to our planet			0
this year @entity4 , named after an @entity106 mythological demon , will not get closer than around nine million miles			0
doomsday asteroid ? an artist 's rendering of the asteroid @entity4 as created by the @entity1 experts say the impact if @entity4 struck the @entity5 would generate a blast equivalent to more than 500 megatons of @entity113 scientists will use the encounter to improve their estimate of just how dangerous the space rock really is to life on @entity5			1
in 2029 , @entity4 is expected to come uncomfortably close , brushing past the @entity5 at a distance of just 30,000 kilometres			1
that will put the asteroid inside the orbit of communication satellites			0
current models predict a tiny but real likelihood of @entity4 colliding with the @entity5 in 2036			1
when the asteroid was discovered in 2004 scientists calculated a one - in - 45 chance of an impact in 2029			2
improved predictions later lifted the threat			0
the asteroid 's latest near approach will occur at midnight @entity135 time tomorrow			2
members of the public can view the event online via the @entity65 web - based sky - watching service , which collects images from observatories around the world			0
' we are excited to cover this asteroid live for the general public			0
' scientists at the @entity147 space agency @entity75 have calculated that if @entity4 struck the @entity5 it would generate a blast equivalent to more than 500 megatons of @entity113			2
in comparison , the most powerful hydrogen bomb ever detonated , the @entity153 @entity152 , released 57 megatons .			0

1000 foot wide asteroid will brush past the @entity5 at a distance of 30,000km
scientists claim little chance of it hitting us - but scientists warn of ' tiny but real ' likelihood it may in 2036
