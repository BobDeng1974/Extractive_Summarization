i thought morally , that something would have been done			0

they gave me loads of support and sent gifts to the club and got involved with my campaign			0
' together we raised over £ 20,000 for cancer research and i will never forget that they were there during my lowest moments			0
' the club will probably say they paid me in full for a year , when i was of no use to them			0
but it still leaves a bad taste that i have not had a call from anyone			0
i feel sad but football and life moves on			0
i have no enemies at @entity1 , i made good friends there			1

he ’s very ambitious , and wants to go for it and get promoted this year			0

' i ca n’t thank him and the chairman @entity103 enough for giving me this opportunity to get my life back on track			0
' the @entity107 have been a massive help during this ordeal - @entity109 in particular			2
i ca n’t thank him enough			0
as has my agent @entity111 , his support has been constant during this nightmare year			0

' good deal : @entity76 boss @entity75 will be delighted with the signing of midfielder @entity0 @entity1 , though , insists they have not been given the opportunity to discuss fresh terms with @entity0 and that they have been nothing but supportive through the process , and hinted the delay in sorting a new contract is not their doing			1
