millions of years of erosion , explosions and a touch of folklore form the narrative behind some of the most unbelievable sights in the world			2
from sweeping curves of @entity12 's @entity11 in the @entity13 to the @entity14 of @entity16 's @entity15 , the simple flow of water over stone has created some remarkable features that look as though they are n't even of this planet , all of which we can visit and marvel at today			1
many of them are incredible natural deceptions , such as @entity27 's @entity26 , which looks for all money in some photographs like a volcano but is in fact the first largest hot spring in the world			1
here are some of the most unbelievable landscapes in the world			0
experts say the best photo opportunities come at midday but first visitors must get one of the 20 permits released each day for the area , with 10 of them released via a lottery four months in advance and the other ten dished out the day before an intended visit			0
experts say the best photo opportunities for @entity11 come at midday but first visitors must get one of the 20 permits released each day once permission is granted to visit there are no marked hiking tracks to get you there , as authorities are keen to preserve its natural beauty formed by the erosion of @entity68 during @entity70 age			1
the 190 million - year - old formation is made of sand dunes which turned to rock through time			2
they are stacked on top of another and hardened by deposit of calcium salts - causing the vertical and horizontal layers			2
the rocks are 190 million years old , and visitors are reminded to respect the beautiful environment @entity84 glacier , @entity85 @entity84 glacier , part of the great @entity88 in @entity89 , may look totally inhospitable but with the right gear and guide it 's a popular hiking destination			1
@entity92 are among a host of companies running tours and charge from £ 65 for a four - hour walk			0
the glacier has also achieved an extra level of fame recently after being one of the filming locations for the blockbuster film @entity103 , starring @entity104 and @entity105 , where is was n't a huge stretch for the icy landscape to co-star as space			1
@entity84 glacier , part of the great @entity88 in @entity89 , is a popular hiking destination in @entity85 ' @entity103 was my second time filming in @entity85 and it was another worldly experience , ' the director told @entity117 in @entity85			1
' @entity85 truly represents the beautiful extremes the nature has to offer			1
' tourists who wish to take on an expediation will be given an expert guide , who will teach how to use basic glacier equipment like crampons and ice axes , the required equipment for this tour			2
the @entity84 glacier in @entity85 may indeed be imposing , but guides are on hand to guide visitors through how to navigate the trek @entity135 , @entity16 legend has it that fairies living in ancient @entity15 in @entity16 's @entity139 lived underground , and these bizarre rock formations were the chimneys of their hidden residences			1
another theory is the distinctive feature of the @entity146 area were formed first by layers from rock developed over time courtesy of volcanic eruptions , and then erosion			1
the granite at the top that forms the mushroom cap - type feature is harder than the colourful sandstone below , hence the brilliant design			0
visitors to @entity15 can see the fairy chimneys in a host of ways			0
you can hire quad bike tours that can quickly get you around the vast area that includes the @entity164 , @entity165 and @entity166 - each with their own features and colours			2
but you can only go around the outside on the bikes			0
for a close - up experience try a horseback tour			0
there are a host of ranches offering horses and guides , and it makes sense when you consider @entity15 actually means , land of the @entity182			0
legend has it that fairies lived underground in ancient @entity15 in @entity16 's @entity139 and these formations were their chimneys @entity188 , @entity189 the world 's largest salt flats are a sight to behold , with it covering a whopping 4.085 square miles in the @entity193 in southwest @entity189			1
while salt is associated with the ocean , these flats are found 11,995 feet above sea level after being formed by a number of prehistoric lakes			2
the white covering is literally metres of salt crust and it is incredibly flat with less than a metre difference across the entire area			0
the world 's largest salt flats , @entity188 , are a sight to behold covering a whopping 4.085 square miles in southwest @entity189 the @entity188 in @entity189 produces salt that inexplicably leads to a bustling trade for excavations @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity211 it looks like a bubbling volcano ready to blow but is in fact the third largest hot spring in the world , behind only after @entity217 in @entity218 and @entity219 in @entity220			1
found in the @entity222 at @entity27 , it is also the biggest hot spring in the @entity13 , but it 's not size that makes it so remarkable			1
it looks like a bubbling volcano ready to blow but @entity26 is in fact the third largest hot spring in the world the bright coloration of the spring is it 's real point of marvel , with its shades of red , orange , yellow , green and blue			1
the unique park has a 40 - mile - long slush of molten rock and crystal under the nation 's first national park			1
instead of a cone with a hole , the caldera is an interconnected maze of gas and water covering almost 60 miles of @entity211 's northwest corner , along with parts of @entity255 and @entity256			2
more than 10,000 mud pots , boiling rivers and geysers act as nature 's pressure - release valves , keeping the heated monster from exploding			2
the bright coloration of the spring is it 's real point of marvel , with its shades of red , orange , yellow , green and blue @entity269 , @entity270 as if a giant hypercolour pen exploded on the moon , the @entity272 hydrothermal fields offer some incredible flourescent colours - all from nature			1
found in the northeast of the @entity280 in the rather grim - looking @entity281 in @entity270 , the craters are the lowest subaerial volcanic vents in the world			0
as if a giant hypercolour pen exploded on the moon , the @entity285 hydrothermal fields in the @entity280 offer some incredible colours the bright yellow of the sulphur mixes with the white salt for this bizarre effect			2
for centuries @entity270 have made the long trek to the @entity281 - one of the hottest and harshest environments in the world - to collect salt from the sun - blasted earth before transporting the slabs back by camel			0
the sulphur mixing with salt produces some fantastic reactions across this @entity270 landscape life is harsh for the thousands of camel herders and salt extractors who use traditional hoes and axes to carve the ' white gold ' out of the ground in the @entity281			0
many of the salt diggers live in @entity314 and hire out their services to different caravans			0
the work , however exhausting , still draws thousands onto the baking salt flats			0
@entity319 , @entity320 what looks like something created with coloured sand in primary school is in fact a colourful sandstone formation in the hills near @entity328			1
walkways have been established throughout the area by the government to accommodate walkers keen to admire what is said to be 24 million years worth of red sandstone and mineral deposits			0
geologists say the same tectonic plates that formed the @entity338 created the layer cake effect and centuries of water erosion complete the design			1
what looks like something created with coloured sand in primary school is in fact a colourful sandstone formation in the hills of @entity320 there is said to be 24 million year 's worth of minerals throughout the beautiful mountain range in @entity320 @entity352 , @entity353 the @entity356 , as it translates from @entity355 , is an arch created by nature to form a bridge over the @entity360 in @entity361 , @entity353			1
the bridge shares it name with the hot springs nearby and it 's believed the extremes of hot and ice may have had something to do with its existence			0
@entity369 visited the site in march 1835 and a thermal spa in the early 20th century took advantage of the apparent healing qualities of the spring			0
it is a natural stone bridge over the @entity375 , situated 2,720 m above the sea level in @entity377			0
the @entity356 , as it translates from @entity355 , is an arch created by nature to form a bridge over the @entity360 in @entity361 , @entity353 this stone bridge over the @entity361 has rock walls and the remnants of an old yellow - colored spa underneath			0

@entity12 's @entity11 and the @entity387 in @entity16 were formed by layers of rock and erosion
it was n't a stretch for @entity85 's @entity84 glacier to co-star as ' space ' in @entity103
@entity26 in @entity27 looks like a volcano about to explode
the @entity319 in @entity320 are hills that take on all the colours of the *rainbow*
