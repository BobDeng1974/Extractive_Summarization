by @entity0 published : 08:07 est , 28 january 2014 updated : 10:34 est , 28 january 2014 @entity2 is ready to hit @entity3 with a bid for contract rebel @entity5 after it emerged the @entity9 midfielder ’s wage demand is only half the amount that has been offered to @entity11			1
after being watched by @entity2 at @entity12 last friday night , @entity5 admitted there were no plans for further talks on renewing a contract that runs out at the end of next season and he was in the dark over his future			0
it was thought he was looking for a pay rise that might cause unrest in the @entity3 dressing room after chief executive @entity25 admitted talks were deadlocked and ruefully added that it was ‘ always about money in these negotiations			0
@entity5 evidently believes he is well worth a salary that would edge him nearer top earners like @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity44 and is prepared to stick to his guns			0
though talks have ground to a halt , @entity3 are reluctant to sell and will ask at least £ 25million , should they sense there is a danger of @entity5 running down his current deal			1
on the ball : @entity30 boss @entity2 watched @entity5 - who wants parity with @entity3 's top earners , including @entity44 ( r ) - in action for the @entity56 giants last week against @entity12 with @entity30 ’s midfield still in need of strengthening , even after the arrival of @entity61 , @entity2 is unlikely to be deterred and will surely be encouraged by a clear signal he would have little difficulty keeping @entity5 happy on the pay front			1
@entity33 exclusively revealed on saturday that @entity2 , and assistants @entity65 and @entity67 , had been met outside @entity12 ’s ground on friday night by one of @entity5 ’ advisers , @entity69 , who escorted them inside and sat with them throughout the game against @entity3			2
sports total , for whom @entity69 works , have since tried to play down claims that @entity5 could be heading for @entity38 , but @entity2 has promised more significant signings before the window closes and has the 24 - year old in his sights			2
changing times : @entity2 said the signing of @entity61 would be one of the first of many big deals at @entity38			0

@entity9 midfielder @entity5 wants £ 150,000 - a - week deal
@entity2 keen to add new signings and @entity5 ' wage demands are well within @entity30 's *limits*
@entity3 are reluctant to sell and will demand at least £ 25million
