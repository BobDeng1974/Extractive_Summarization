@entity1 manager @entity0 has been impressed with the way @entity3 have coped without some of their biggest stars while his side have been crippled by a long injury list			1
strikers @entity9 , scorer of 19 goals in 23 matches , and @entity13 have not played for over a month , during which time @entity3 have won seven and drawn one			1
captain @entity17 has been missing for all but one of the matches in that run , but @entity3 have still put together a sequence which has seen them draw level with @entity23 at the top of the table			1
@entity1 manager @entity0 has been impressed with @entity3 's resilience in recent weeks @entity3 have been without striker @entity9 for the last month after he picked up an injury against the @entity1 the clubs ' budgets are vastly different , of course , but by contrast @entity1 have won just once in 10 games with the likes of goalkeeper @entity44 , defenders @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , midfielders @entity33 , @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity37 all missing for some or all of that spell			1
those absences , particularly at the back , have contributed to @entity1 having a defensive record which is beaten only by @entity49 in terms of goals conceded			1
' injuries always play a part			0
i do n't think it helps when you have to change things around , especially in certain positions , ' @entity0 said , ahead of the visit of the defending champions			1
' you want to have a consistent back line with the same understanding and partnerships , and that has cost us			0
manager @entity66 ( pictured on thursday night ) will be pleased they 've kept the pace regardless captain @entity17 has been missing for all but one of the matches in a decent run of form ' there are certain players you can replace better than others and it is not ideal when you can not find solutions			0
' but in the same way it has been a good period to find out about our characters and i still feel this squad is strong enough to be very successful			0
' it is the time to get a couple of positive results and see how far we can go this season because i do feel the group is stronger than ever and more focused than even at the start of the season			0
' @entity3 are playing with real swagger and arrogance and they do n't need many chances to punish you			2
' i have been very impressed in the way they have coped with big players missing			0
' it is always a sign of a good unit when you have probably the most effective players on the pitch missing and you can carry on finding a way to score goals and win games			2
@entity9 has been in impressive form when fit - scoring 19 goals in 23 matches this campaign @entity113 @entity13 has n't been fit since the @entity114 win away at @entity115 on december 10 ' it is not easy to lose strikers like @entity13 and @entity9 for such a long time and go on such an unbelievable run			1
' they have strong characters who can find solutions			0
once they get the players back , the team could get a second boost in what is left of the season			2
' @entity1 drew with @entity129 in the @entity130 in midweek but they are looking to avoid a fifth successive @entity132 defeat on saturday			2
this is their worst sequence in the league since they lost six on the trot in 2005 , and the visit of @entity3 presents a real threat to the confidence gained from the @entity129 result			2
@entity140 has pitched in with important goals in the absence of @entity3 's main attacking threats ' it is one of those games where we need to take responsibility , ' @entity0 said			1
' we are at home , we have had four really bad results and we need to put that right			0
' it does n't matter which opposition you are playing against you need to look at what we can do and we are looking to carry on the signs we showed against @entity129			0
' when you play a team like @entity3 , you know you have to be at your very best because they will always take their opportunities , but the way we performed at the @entity161 ( in a 1 - 0 defeat ) deserved more than we got and i think we are ready to face a team like @entity3			1
' but the margin of error against these sides is very small			0

@entity3 have been without @entity9 for a month
but players like @entity140 have pitched in with important goals
