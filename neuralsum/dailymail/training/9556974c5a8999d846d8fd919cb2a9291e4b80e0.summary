by @entity1 reporter published : 18:11 est , 15 october 2012 updated : 07:36 est , 16 october 2012 president @entity3 had a speech prepared in october 1962 announcing to the @entity6 people a full scale invasion of @entity8 , it has been revealed			0
he planned to deliver the speech if @entity11 ships carrying strategic nuclear missiles reached the island , according to papers released from @entity16 ’s personal files by the @entity17			1
the @entity18 began 50 years ago this week , but even now the world is still learning just how close it was to nuclear @entity20 during those 13 tense days			0
dire times : president @entity3 ( right ) is seen with his brother and closest confidant @entity16 at the @entity24 before the crisis began in october 1962 ' my fellow @entity6 , with a heavy heart , and in necessary fulfillment of my oath of office , i have ordered - and the @entity30 has now carried out - military operations with conventional weapons only , to remove a major nuclear weapons build - up from the soil of @entity8 , ' read a draft speech @entity3 planned to read			1
those remarks were among the many private thoughts revealed in new papers released by the estate of @entity16 , who served as attorney general and his brother 's closest confidant during the missile crisis			1
@entity45 professor and @entity18 scholar @entity44 writes in the @entity47 that an @entity6 strike would have been an almost certain precursor to @entity50 , which would have cost hundreds of millions of lives - at least			2
@entity16 detailed a plan offered by secretary of defense @entity54 to bomb @entity8 with 500 sorties and then invade with 90,000 @entity6 troops if @entity11 ships broke a blockade and brought strategic nuclear missiles to the nation 90 miles off the coast of @entity61			1
' if we go in , we go in hard , ' @entity16 wrote			1
intelligence : this is the missile base the @entity6 military planned to strike brink of war : the @entity68 provided @entity3 's key advice during the missile crisis , though @entity16 said only his brother was able to lead the world away from the edge of disaster @entity16 scribbled notes during a meeting about a possible airstrike on @entity8			1
' invasion must follow ! ! ' was @entity54 's message			2
the strategic nature of the @entity82 ' nuclear weapons was one of the reasons why their close proximity caused such alarm at the @entity24			0
strategic nuclear weapons are used to attack , as their name suggests , particular strategic targets , such as military installations , missile command centers or cities			0
tactical nuclear weapons tend to be smaller devices that are used on the battlefield			0
professor @entity97 believes that the @entity82 would have responded to an invasion with tactical nuclear rockets - striking @entity6 ships and troops			2
@entity6 had no knowledge that these smaller nuclear weapons were already on the island			0
the @entity6 would have likely used nuclear weapons of their own , almost certainly drawing in a further @entity11 nuclear response			0
@entity16 's papers reveal that outcome did n't happen only because @entity3 and @entity11 premier @entity109 both realized the severity of what was coming			1
the @entity11 ships carrying missiles to @entity8 turned back thanks to a series of public , private and secret concessions - including the withdrawal of @entity119 missiles from @entity120			2
though the documents , released just shy of the 50th anniversary of the @entity18 , do n't rewrite @entity125 history , they do provide insight into the personal thoughts of the era 's key figures , historians say			1
@entity16 advised @entity3 during the @entity131 invasion and the missile crisis , key moments during his brother 's presidency			1
his title as attorney general ‘ disguised his real position , which was the closest adviser to the president and the president 's confidant and the person the president trusted most , ’ said journalist and historian @entity138 , who blogs for @entity140			2
‘ that 's the interesting point of this , that he kind of reflects his brother 's thinking			0
’ the seven boxes of newly released material include telegrams , reports , meeting transcripts and handwritten notes by @entity16 , some with doodles and quotes in the margins			1
historical marginalia : @entity16 doodled the @entity163 and wrote down a quote from a @entity167 @entity166 memorial in @entity168 ‘ it gives you a sort of insight into what was on his mind , what he doodled , ’ @entity138 said			1
‘ it 's interesting from a human perspective			0
’ one page , sandwiched between lined pages of notes on the @entity182 , includes a sketch of the @entity163 with a summarized quote from a @entity167 @entity166 memorial in @entity168			0
‘ we the @entity187 of @entity167 for your liberty and ours give our souls to god , our bodies to @entity168 and our hearts to @entity167 , ’ @entity16 wrote in pencil			1
the 1961 botched invasion sought to oust communists with the help of anti-castro @entity8 exiles and veiled @entity6 support			0
more than 100 members of the @entity202 - sponsored invasion team were killed and many were captured by @entity8 forces			0
one @entity202 document offers a profile of @entity207 : it calls him intelligent but ‘ not very stable ’ and ‘ touchy , impatient and rash			1
’ another outlines plans to assassinate @entity207 , including a 1964 plan with connections to the @entity214			1
key moments : in his role as attorney general between 1961 and 1964 , @entity16 ( pictured ) advised his brother president @entity3 during the @entity182 and the missile crisis nuclear fears : this newspaper map from the time of the @entity18 shows the distances from @entity8 of various cities on the @entity226 the mob and ‘ patriotic @entity8 exiles ’ eventually settled on a payment of $ 100,000 for assassinating @entity207 , $ 20,000 for his brother @entity230 and $ 20,000 for revolutionary @entity231 , plus $ 2,500 for expenses			1
another prominent thread throughout the documents is the 13 - day crisis over @entity11 missiles in @entity8			1
on one white page from a meeting on october 16 , 1962 , the first day of the crisis , @entity16 wrote out two columns : proponents of a blockade against @entity8 and supporters of a military strike			2
‘ it 's interesting to see in his handwriting who 's on which side , ’ @entity138 said			0

the then @entity263 president of @entity8 also bought @entity265 - fabricated arms from two middle - men who had strong links to the extreme @entity258 right			0
it sheds light on the extent @entity207 , who in public was stringently committed to socialism , was willing to go in order to further his grip on the island nation and prevent an invasion from the @entity6 @entity280 , historical investigations director at @entity258 foreign intelligence agency @entity281 ( @entity281 ) said : ' evidently , the @entity8 revolutionary army did not fear contagion from personal links to @entity285 , so long as it served its objectives			2
' the documents , released by the @entity281 and published online by @entity258 newspaper @entity288 , show a series of plans developed in october 1962 - at the height of the @entity18			2
