the mother of a @entity2 soldier who is returning home after going to fight @entity4 in @entity5 says she is relieved that her ' @entity6 ' is safe - but admits he has been ' bloody stupid '			1
the 19 - year - old private , who is serving with the 2nd battalion of @entity10 , was being flown home last night after being found near the border between @entity5 and @entity13			1
last night , his mother said she was ' extremely angry ' with her son , but dubbed him ' @entity6 ' after saying he was brave			1
the mother of the 19 - year - old soldier who left to fight against @entity4 has called her son ' bloody stupid ' @entity6 is a film series about a troubled @entity20 veteran , played by @entity21			1
she said : ' @entity6 is coming home			2
i 've asked them to leave me in a room with him for two minutes			0
it 's the same scenario as when your child runs in the road and you grab them and smack them for doing something so bloody stupid			1
' i 'm extremely angry with him , but for someone to do that shows they have balls			1
' it was reported on thursday that the teenager had left his base after telling his family he was joining the @entity43 in their battle against the extremist group because ' these guys need our help '			1
the soldier , from @entity50 , was in @entity51 on leave from his base in @entity54 when he decided to travel to the war - torn country			1
he was the first @entity2 soldier to have gone to fight against the terror group and his disappearance fuelled fears that he could have been a prime beheading target for @entity63 jihadists			1
but he was reportedly found ' safe and well ' near the front line in @entity65 after his fellow rebel fighters revealed his location			1
diplomats then got in touch with @entity43 forces , who arranged for him to be dropped off at the @entity72 in @entity73 , where an officer from his regiment was waiting			2
it is not known whether or not he will face formal disciplinary action , as he was on leave at the time of his disappearance , but if he is charged with going awol or desertion he could be sentenced to detention or imprisonment			0
desertion carries a maximum sentence of life in prison if the serviceman involved is judged to have been avoiding active service , while going @entity89 or failing to attend for duty can bring a two - year sentence			1
however , hundreds of troops go awol each year without facing any disciplinary action , and according to the latest available figures the most severe sentence handed out for desertion in recent years was 18 months at the military detention centre in @entity98			0
the private , who disappeared last week , is serving with the 2nd battalion of @entity10 pictured : @entity43 fighters outside @entity103 , @entity13			1
a number of foreign fighters have come from around the world to join @entity43 forces in the battle against @entity4 defence secretary @entity109 had yesterday told the @entity110 that the serving soldier , who has not been identified , had been found and was being returned to his unit			1
he said : ' @entity113 may also want to know the soldier reported as missing last week has now been located and is being returned to his unit			0
' the @entity115 had previously said they would not send police to the @entity117 looking for him			0
yesterday , a defence source said : ' we are just grateful to have him back at the moment			0
' the soldier left his base after sending a message to his family saying : ' i 'm with other @entity2 people and a @entity128 at the moment			2
i do n't know how to explain it to you but i really want and need to do this and i will be safe			0
he added : ' i have good skills and i can speak the language , i can help these people and help with this fight			0
i will get in trouble for being @entity89 , but it 's minor and no prison sentence			0
' the private joined up at the age of 16 after leaving school and had reportedly been learning @entity143			0
he was said to have once shared a barracks with murdered fusilier @entity146			0
he is understood to have visited the area with the military for a training exercise before he decided to return to fight			0
the serviceman , who has not been named for security reasons , was stationed in @entity54 and travelled to the region via @entity51 while on annual leave he is thought to have been fighting alongside a group called @entity155 , who have @entity157 , @entity128 and other @entity2 among their number			0
the soldier reportedly posted a picture online over the weekend showing him standing next to @entity128 ex-serviceman @entity161			0
in the post , he referred to @entity161 as his ' wingman ' and , in a message to his family , added : ' i 'm all safe guys			0
' the @entity10 are based at the @entity168 , where the soldier will return to find out whether he faces a court martial			0
in december it emerged that two former @entity2 soldiers had travelled to @entity5 to fight against @entity4 after feeling ' compelled ' to take up arms following the murder of aid volunteer @entity175			2
news of the soldier came as the defence secretary was urged to clarify exactly what @entity2 's plan is for the campaign against @entity4 in @entity13			1
@entity183 mp @entity182 said it was troubling defence chiefs had failed to outline the objectives for the campaign against @entity4 , also known as @entity4 , in recent evidence to a @entity110 committee			2
speaking at @entity194 questions , the @entity191 and @entity192 mp mr @entity182 said : ' do you think it is acceptable none of the service chiefs who gave evidence to the defence committee 's recent inquiry was willing or able to articulate the @entity2 's objective or strategic plan in @entity13 ? what is our plan exactly ? ' mr @entity109 replied : ' our plan in @entity13 is very simple - it is to disrupt threats to the @entity2 mainland and our interests overseas , secondly it is as part of an international coalition to defeat @entity4 , including discrediting its violent ideology			1
' it is thirdly to mitigate the impact of @entity4 and other violent extremist groups on the stability of the region as a whole			2
' it is understood the @entity2 soldier joined a group called the @entity226 , who boast , ' it is better to live one day as a @entity228 that a thousand days as a sheep			0
' they are the foreign fighters who have travelled to @entity5 to fight , not for jihad , but on behalf of the @entity43 communities who are defending their communities from the advance of @entity236			1
just as hundreds of young @entity237 have gone to fight for the radical islamists of @entity239 , so increasing numbers are now travelling to fight for their avowed enemies , the @entity65			2
westerners in @entity65 : a photo of @entity244 fighters from the @entity246 page @entity247 , a former @entity157 soldier now with @entity248 ( @entity249 ) , operates @entity250 openly calling for volunteers to travel to join the fight			1
just as many of the @entity239 's foreign volunteers have been drawn from the ranks of @entity257 youth worldwide , many of the initial @entity249 volunteers have come from the @entity43 diaspora			1
last august a hairdresser from @entity262 was reported to be the first @entity263 to travel to fight alongside @entity43 forces			2
ethnic @entity266 @entity265 from @entity267 , 26 , travelled to @entity13 to join the @entity43 peshmerga as they desperately tried to halt @entity239 's lightning advance			1
but since then many others have been inspired to take up arms against @entity239 , perhaps also inspired by the radical socialist experiment underway in the @entity43 autonomous region of @entity274			2
brothers in arms : briton @entity276 , right , with @entity157 @entity247 , who is also fighting in @entity5 inspired by the social ecologist and anarchist @entity279 it has adopted a vision of ' libertarian municipalism ' calling for @entity65 to create free , self - governing communities			1
last october it was reported that a currently serving @entity2 @entity284 had been questioned by police on suspicion he was travelling to fight with @entity43 militias during his leave			0
the 22 - year - old commando was quizzed after he prepared to fly from @entity290 on a one - way ticket to @entity292			1
he was suspected of being in contact with @entity43 militant groups			0
two women , @entity296 , 31 , and @entity297 , 20 , have also reportedly travelled to fight with the @entity65 , inspired perhaps by the images of female fighters on the front line against @entity239 terrorists			2
it is perhaps the only place in the world where women are fighting on the front line of armed conflict			0
there are also claims that a number of @entity237 biker gangs have travelled to @entity5 and are helping to assist the resistance			0
leaders of the @entity314 - based @entity313 , which has strong @entity43 links , have posted images of their @entity318 riders posing in the city - some of them carrying weapons			2
the news came just days after three members of a notorious motorcycle gang from the @entity324 were told they had not committed any crime by travelling to @entity326 to join the fight against @entity4 .			0

soldier 's mother dubbed her son ' @entity6 ' but said he was ' bloody stupid '
said she was ' extremely angry ' that her son , from @entity50 , had fled
19 - year - old was last night being flown back after being found in @entity65
