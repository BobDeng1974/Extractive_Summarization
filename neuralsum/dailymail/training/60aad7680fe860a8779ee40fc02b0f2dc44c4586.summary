the only female manager in the @entity2 top flight has revealed she would love to test herself in the men 's professional game			1
@entity5 led her @entity7 team to a second - place finish in the @entity2 in the season just ended , with @entity10 taking the title on goal difference			1
@entity5 guided @entity7 to second place in the women 's @entity2 the 38 - year - old former boss of the @entity15 has been home in @entity17 for two years with @entity7 , taking her prominent post just as the women 's game began to benefit from a rush of support from the @entity23 and parent clubs			1
@entity25 initially seized the chance to work in the @entity27 , the country that was quickest of all on the uptake with women 's professional football , because she saw no prospect of earning a living in the @entity17 game			1
that is changing , and with former @entity38 manager @entity37 coaching the men 's team at @entity41 , who play in the tier outside the @entity44 , even previously bolted doors are opening to women			2
' i 'd hope so , ' @entity5 said			0
' all coaches aspire to be at the best level they can get to , and i 'm no different			0
' if it happened for me that the next opportunity was in the men 's game , then i 'd welcome that			0
' but i also think there needs to be more female coaches at the top end of the women 's game before more are entering into the men 's game			2
' the @entity61 licence is a prerequisite for @entity2 managers , and @entity64 - born @entity5 wants those running the women 's game to show faith in female candidates who achieve that standard			1
@entity10 manager @entity70 ( left ) and captain @entity71 show off the @entity72 ' as clubs and boards and chairmen diversify , i think we will see more opportunities , but it 's up to those who are in charge to place more trust in female leaders , ' @entity5 said			2
@entity5 addressed @entity83 conference at @entity84 this week , and spoke of the opportunities opening up in football , including coaching , media and sports science			0
she added : ' i 've come home after 10 years in @entity27 and am now able to forge a career at a club like @entity7 , to provide opportunities not just for professional players but for staff involved in the game , and that is similar to what 's being done at other clubs around the country			0
' i think this is a real golden period in women 's football			0
