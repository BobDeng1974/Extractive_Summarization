at 72 ounces , the steak is big enough to feed nine people			0
then there are portions of bread , soup , salad , baked potato and ice cream – plus servings of tomato juice and milk			2
@entity18 that with five decades of failure by countless customers who have tried to stomach this colossal spread in under an hour - and the @entity17 challenge seems unconquerable			0
that was until @entity20 showed up to restaurant in @entity22 , @entity23 – and guzzled the estimated 5,000 - calorie gut - busting banquet with 18 minutes still on the clock			1
meat head : @entity20 poses with the 72 - steak and vast array of side dishes before gobbling it all down gut - busting : the enormous steak , served at the @entity17 in @entity22 , was complemented by a bread roll , soup , salad , baked potato and servings of milk and tomato juice			1
it took mr @entity20 42 minutes to finish it as well as earning a place in @entity44 food folklore , the 6ft 5in - tall bodybuilder , who weighs 230lb , got the $ 75 back that he had paid for the platter			1
kitchen manager @entity46 was stunned when he witnessed the meal being devoured by this hulk of a man , who chewed in rhythm to @entity52 tracks on his @entity54 mp3 player			0
he was even more shocked when mr @entity20 , 25 , ordered an extra glass of soda and also added four tall glasses of lemonade			1
even more astoundingly , he polished off a beer that an astonished customer offered to buy him after completing the challenge in 41 minutes and 46 seconds			0
‘ we have no documentation of anybody ever finishing this , ’ mr @entity46 told @entity63 newspaper			0
‘ i was in awe just after he finished the steak			0
most people ca n’t even get to the sides			0
’ the restautant does not reveal nutrition values for the challenge			0
but it is estimated to contain at least 5,000 calories and 22g of fat - more than double the daily allowance			1
mr @entity20 , from @entity78 , @entity79 , said he hoped to eat the steak faster ‘ but it was cooked almost between medium - well and well , which made it a lot harder to chew			1
’ grease : within a day of eating the steak , mr @entity20 had devoured this 6lb burger with buns made from grilled cheese sandwiches as the @entity88 in @entity89 , @entity23 ll in a day 's work : hours before he had also eaten this 2ft - long @entity92 hotdog at @entity93 in @entity22 @entity94 : shortly before , he also downed this three - litre bowl of ramen soup at @entity97 but mr @entity20 , a former @entity98 football player who suffered obesity problems as a child , did have one trick up his sleeve			1
he had already completed more than 100 challenges across the @entity44 – in a bizarre bid to show the world how to ‘ eat fat but remain fit ’			1
mr @entity20 follows a new competitive eating mania , which has in part been sparked by tv show @entity108			1
but mr @entity20 goes to lengths to point out that @entity110 , the host of that programme , has only scored 37 ‘ wins ’			1
since he embarked on his competitive eating adventure two years ago , he has eaten everything from heaps of hotdogs , a 6lb burrito and a 28in pizza			2
he had also knocked off an 84oz steak challenge in @entity120 – but that did n’t include so many additional items			0
steaking a claim : the @entity17 in @entity22 , where mr @entity20 ate a 72oz sirloin challenge : @entity127 's website			2
his bizzarre mission is to show the world how to ' eat fat and stay fit ' mr @entity20 , who has his own website and posts videos on @entity134 of some of the challenges , had already polished off three challenges in the 24 hours before arriving at the @entity17			1
he guzzled down fries and a 6lb bacon burger with grilled cheese sandwiches for a bun at @entity22 ’s @entity142			2
after that was he ate a 1lb doughnut in @entity145 before swallowing a 2ft - long chili - cheese hot dog with jalepenos , onions and a side of yet more fries			2
and just a few hours before the steak challenge , he gulped down a three - litre bowl of ramen noodle soup at @entity154 in @entity155			1
mr @entity20 says the only thing holding him back from doing more challenges is his girlfriend			2
‘ it sucks i 'm not single , ’ he told the @entity159 who has so far competed in 15 states			0
‘ not i want to break up with my girlfriend or whatever , but i 'd like to move out west			0
’ the highest concentration of eating challenges is in @entity165			0

@entity20 devoured the 5,000 - calorie gut - busting banquet in 42 minutes
already eaten 6lb burger , 2ft hotdog and 3 - litre bowl of soup in previous day
spend hours working off the calories in the *gym* in bid to ' eat fat but stay fit '
