by @entity0 published : 14:23 est , 24 february 2013 updated : 14:33 est , 24 february 2013 an artist is making her fortune by selling animal sculptures she makes out of rubbish fished out of bins and skips			1
@entity6 , 58 , collects junk like tin cans , costume jewellery and mechanical wires from the streets while walking her dog and uses them for her creations			1
she also scours jumble and boot sales and charity shops to pick up other items such as clock mechanisms and windscreen wipers			0
@entity6 , 58 , sells animal sculptures she makes out of rubbish fished out of bins and skips used kitchen utensils , old keys and copper wiring helped make this model of a dog created by @entity6 the two parrot figures have been made out of old sweet wrappers and the hare is made of metallic junk @entity6 turns the scrap into her stunning sculptures that include birds , cats , squirrels , horses , zebras , stags , hares and even a preying mantis			1
she begins by making a rough ' sketch ' out of wire of the animal and then covers it in recycled tin or pieces from her collection of scrap metal and junk			2
any alterations are made with a pair of pliers and snippers , before the tin is soldered in place and other items are held by electrical copper wire			0
sculptures can range between 4ins and 4ft in size and a huge variety of animals are included in the collection the griffin sculpture , made in 2011 , is the only mythical creature that @entity6 has added to her collection the frames of each animal are ' sketched ' with wiring before the recycled materials are soldered on the pieces range in size from 4ins to 4ft 6ins and cost anywhere from £ 135 to £ 2,000 each			1
@entity6 , from @entity76 , said : ' i make things because i ca n't imagine not doing that , and it is so worthwhile when a piece makes someone smile			1
' i find a lot of my materials by keeping my eyes open when out walking the dog , i 'll always have a quick look in any skip			2
' a lot of pieces are just lying on the ground , jumble sales and charity shops are also good , and a lot of friends save things for me			0
this sculpture of a horse is entitled ' time flies ' because of the use of clockwork mechanisms in its frame the range of trophy stags are made to look more eccentric , by having leaves or flowers in their mouths fishing for materials : @entity6 scours bins and skips to find items to make sculptures like this kingfisher ' the materials i use can be almost anything , a list would include food cans , old spanners , metal clips , costume jewellery , clock and watch pieces , copper electrical wire and plastic			1
' at the moment i have two methods of working , the little birds involve making a ' sketch ' or ' drawing ' in wire which i then partially cover in recycled tin			0
' the second method is a bit more complicated , i will make a very basic armature from wire netting but will keep the form very fluid			0
' i then make a total mess of my work surface when i lay out hundreds of bits and pieces of scrap metal from windscreen wipers to dog leads , keys , and cupboard handles			0
' the collection of sculptures made by @entity6 includes unusual creatures such as this mantis figure discarded spatulas and old springs were soldered together to make this sculpture of a cow looking skywards			2

@entity6 , 58 , makes sculptures from junk to sell for up to £ 2,000
she finds materials in the street and in skips when walking her dog
