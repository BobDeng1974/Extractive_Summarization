" mr. @entity8 's remains were found in the bear 's stomach , " troopers spokeswoman @entity12 said			1
oh , my : authorities found the victim 's remains in the stomach of a @entity20 but even that was n't enough to prompt final determination since this bear could have been near the cabin and ate the remains after another bear left			1
however , @entity12 said wildlife troopers made the determination that this was the bear responsible after no other bears were seen in the vicinity of the kill			0
@entity8 , of @entity11 , and his wife were at the lake last thursday when the attack happened			1

@entity10 is about 110 miles southeast of @entity11 a necropsy was conducted on the bear the following day in @entity11 , and @entity53 biologist @entity52 said the bear appeared to be an older adult male based upon the wear on its molars			0
she said it had normal levels of fat , meaning it was not in a condition of starvation , and did not have any apparent disease or infirmity			0
" we do n't have any kind of determination of what led up to the attack , " @entity12 said			0
it did n't appear the bear was protecting a food cache , and since it was male , it was n't being protective of cubs , she said			0
not common : there have only been four fatal @entity20 attacks in @entity6 in the last 61 years there appear to be no mitigating factors for the mauling , she added			1
attacks by black bears are very uncommon , with fatal attacks even more rare			2
