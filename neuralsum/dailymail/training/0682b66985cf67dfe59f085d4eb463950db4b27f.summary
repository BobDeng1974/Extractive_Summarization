a brilliant innovation is reminding the world that no one should underestimate the smug satisfaction that comes with irritating your enemies			2
when seeking vengeance , this new @entity8 company who promise that immature pranks are the best solution			1
an envelope full of millions of tiny , plastic pieces of glitter is all that is needed to tip someone right over the edge , with the sparkly misery promised to last weeks			1
the genius behind the website @entity20 is 22 - year - old @entity8 @entity22 , who admits ' he hates glitter			1
' ' i 'm a 22 year old dude that has too much free time apparently because now my plans for the next few weeks will consist of sending stupid glitter to terrible people , ' @entity22 told @entity30			1
' pay us money , provide an address anywhere in the world and we 'll send them so much glitter in an envelope that they 'll be finding it everywhere for weeks			2
' the website was launched on tuesday night and has already gone viral worldwide			1
' the website is just over 24 hours old			2
we 've had over 1.3m visits , 250k social shares so the response has been pretty intense , ' said @entity22			2
part of the appeal is that each package will be individually ' wrapped with hate ' by @entity22 himself for the incredibly low price of $ 9.99 per envelope			1
the hateful envelopes may seem harmless , with some people on @entity72 expressing confusion at the concept due to their personal love of glitter			1
however , the frustration felt when covered with seemingly endless pieces of glitter can not be fully understood unless one has experienced the twinkly torture			2
it sticks to clothes , skin , hair and furniture and somehow has the creepy ability to pop up when least expected for weeks after the glitter ambush			2
rave reviews , as well as complaints from unhappy envelope recipients , indicate the product 's effectiveness the glitter will stick to every possible surface of the recipient 's body and home and will continually and inexplicably appear for weeks after the ambush so why should someone use this website to send the sparkly packages ? the website founders explain that packaging the envelopes is an extremely messy process			1
people who use the service can now cause the maximum amount of irritation to their enemy without any personal pain			0
' we 're making a heroic sacrifice			0
( @entity115 ) gets all over our working space , ' the @entity114 team explain			0
' you can do it yourself if you want			0
but then you have to handle the glitter , making your own house full of glitter			2
' these envelopes from hell , known in some circles as ' glitter bombs ' , are the perfect form of anonymous vengeance which the website promises to do for the bargain price of $ 9.99			1
the website even generously gives the option of including a hateful note in the envelope to really hammer the message home			0
the unique commercial endeavour has paid off as just hours after launching the website was forced to suspend purchases			1
' you guys have a sick obsession with shipping people glitter , ' @entity22 explained			1
although some believe the website is just a gag , the administrators promise the company is real , explaining ' we spent too much time , money and resources putting this ... website up to not get paid for it			0
' the way it works is simple			0
when on the website , ' click the buy button			0
decide whose day you want to ruin and then enter their address			0
' the website has a helpful @entity161 section , although they point out ' yes , somehow we do have frequently asked questions ' the website already has glowing reviews from thrilled customers , including gleeful @entity167 : ' i bought this for my husband , he opened the mail before work & got it everywhere ! he had to change , was late for work and might be getting fired , @entity175 ' however , @entity176 warned people to not underestimate the power of glitter			1
' for my one year anniversary i did n't know what to get my wife , so i bought this thinking it would be funny			0
' it was n't , i 'm now divorced , broke and living with my best friend			0
i 'd like to talk with the owner to get a refund and discuss damages			0
' a thrilled customer wrote a reference , explaining '' i bought this for my husband , he opened the mail before work & got it everywhere ! he had to change , was late for work and might be getting fired , @entity175 '			0

a @entity8 - based website allows people to anonymously harass enemies
@entity22 's newly launched *business* anonymously sends envelopes full of glitter to *poeple* 's enemies upon request
' @entity20 ' has gone viral and is a global *success* just hours after launching
the website had to *temporarily* suspend sales when they were bombarded with thousands of requests
they have returned and their price has been *slashed* from $ 9.99 to $ 4.99
