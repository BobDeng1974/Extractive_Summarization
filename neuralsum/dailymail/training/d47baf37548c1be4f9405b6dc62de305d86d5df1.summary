by @entity1 reporter a new report commissioned by the @entity4 speedskating team has catalogued a series of mistakes that contributed to the team 's worst performance in 30 years at this winter 's @entity9			1
among the errors were the late introduction of suits made by @entity14 as well as having the team train at high altitude and outdoors in @entity17 prior to the games , which took place indoors and at sea level			1
the findings show that the conditions in @entity17 masked a drop in form by the athletes			0
a new report cites late introduction of new uniforms and poorly planned altitude training as factors in the @entity4 speedskating team 's worst @entity32 performance in decades the report , detailed in a story by the @entity36 , reflects a team becoming progressively more and more frustrated as athletes failed to excel			1
the @entity14 suits , given to the team only shortly before the race , should likely have been replaced with new @entity43 39 suits as well as a skate polish introduced just before competition			1
' the idea that we would give these game - changers to our athletes right before the @entity32 and they would get to the line and feel like they had an advantage , that did not work , ' said @entity52 , executive director of @entity53			0
' the lesson there is that if we have game - changers like that , let 's introduce them in december , not february			2
' the review also noted that there was a failure to analyze performance data prior to the @entity9 that would have easily predicted the team would not peak @entity64 - based @entity14 declined requests to comment on the report			1
the company has renewed their partnership with the @entity4 through the 2022 winter games			2

' when you go back and look at those performance trends , our expectations going into @entity75 were not realistic , ' mr. @entity52 said			0
' the idea that we were going to go there and win eight , 10 , 12 medals in long - track alone was way off			0
' the team has since parted with director @entity84 , who was a major supporter of altitude training as well as guiding the team in the run up to the @entity32			1
the report is not unlike @entity89 's review of the @entity4 men 's and women 's relay team performance in the 2008 summer games , which cited ' excessive travel and poor long - term planning on the part of athletes , their coaches and agents " that report 's recommendations helped the team score 29 medals in @entity105 in 2012			1
the speedskating organization was somewhat reticent to undergo such a review			0
' there was a little bit of a reaction of , ' you know , Â ‘ i do n't want to relive it			0
i want to put it my rearview mirror			0
you guys figure it out , '' @entity52 said .			0
