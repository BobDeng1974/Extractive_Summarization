an unusual new room has officially opened as part of @entity7 's first underwater hotel has opened for business			1
the three floor little piece of luxury is situated 820ft from the little - known island of @entity13 , off the mainland of @entity15 and @entity16 and the room can only be reached by going down a step ladder			1
the top floor is the balcony , perfect for star gazing at night and soaking some rays during the day			2
the middle floor is where the dining room is , but offers guests the chance to relax and enjoy the sunset			0
the newly opened ‘ @entity52 ’ - 13 feet ( four metres ) under the @entity26 - allows travellers to observe shoals of fish drifting past during the day , watch squid and octopus at night , and perhaps even spot rarer underwater creatures lurking in the coral which is developing around the base of the room and its anchoring lines			1
the idyllic room costs £ 960 ( $ 1,500 ) a night			1
you may find it hard to get some shut eye , as the fabulous sea creatures might leave you amazed andintrigued it ’s not the world 's first underwater room , although it may be one of the most remote : the @entity27 is situated on an idyllic island beach on the northern most point of one of @entity7 ’s finest island sanctuaries			2
with a population of 300,000 in total , the island has a very low level of tourism despite white coral sand and clear waters			0
guests of the @entity74 sleep in a glass - walled underwater chamber surrounded only by the sea while , above sea level , two additional levels are provided for leisure and recreation			1
the roof doubles as a sunbathing terrace during the day and a stargazing spot at night , and without any light pollution means would - be astronomers can enjoy exceptional night - time views			2
the @entity86 can only be reached by boat and is situated 820ft from the little - known island of @entity13 , off the mainland of @entity15 and @entity16 the landing deck includes a lounge and bathroom , accessed by ladder			1
a small group of @entity96 and @entity15 investors made the underwater room on @entity13 possible , and it is now owned by @entity98			1
the company says the idea of the underwater room was based on probably the first of its kind , also designed by @entity104 , a @entity96 artist and public speaker , which opened in 2000 in @entity107 in @entity108 , near @entity109			2
called the @entity112 , the single room of the hotel lies three metres below the surface of the lake and proved an instant hit			0
( @entity104 is no stranger to creating unusual public spaces for people to stay , having also created the @entity118 , where guests can look across the city of @entity108 from 13 metres up an old oak tree			0
) staying at the underwater hotel would make for a somewhat interesting game of ' @entity124 ' ... the special underwater hotel is located off the island of @entity13 , which can be reached easily by boat for further exploring sub-aquatic tourism is of growing interest in the specialist hotel sector : the @entity131 off @entity132 , @entity133 , features three underwater rooms , while the @entity135 also has a number of underwater ventures			0
last year @entity139 ’s space - age underwater project , the @entity141 hotel , designed by company @entity142 was announced and there are more in the pipeline			1
