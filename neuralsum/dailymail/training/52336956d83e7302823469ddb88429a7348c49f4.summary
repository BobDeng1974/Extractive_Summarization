@entity0 will end 18 months of waiting on saturday night when he faces @entity1 for the @entity3 welterweight title in @entity4 , @entity5			1
both @entity0 and @entity1 made the weight when the two weighed in on friday night with the @entity3 champion coming in slightly heavier			1
unbeaten @entity9 fighter @entity0 tipped the scales at 146.5lbs while champion @entity1 was 146.75lbs			1
@entity0 saw three projected title tilts at former champion @entity13 fall through then was forced to watch @entity1 get there first and dethrone @entity13 over 12 rounds last april			1
but the @entity9 man is convinced all the waiting will have been worth it when he gets in the ring for a bout which will leave the winner in a position to take any number of lucrative showdowns ahead			0
@entity0 said : ' this has been a long time coming but i 've finally arrived at the big stage now			2
' it 's every fighter 's dream to win a world title and it 's all i 've been thinking about through training and waiting			0
somebody 's 0 has got to go : both @entity1 and @entity0 are unbeaten in their careers ' i know @entity1 is a very tough customer and a very worthy champion , but this is my time			1
i 'm very well prepared mentally and physically and saturday night can not come quick enough for me			0
' while @entity0 has designs on a domestic super-fight against @entity18 , @entity1 believes another headline win could put him in the frame for a meeting with @entity54			2
@entity1 's slow - burning career looked to have stalled when he fought a draw with veteran @entity57 in 2012 , but a subsequent rematch win followed by his last two top - level performances have suddenly made him a man to be reckoned with			0
fighting fit : both @entity1 and @entity0 looked in good shape as they weighed in ahead of their fight @entity1 said : ' i am one of the quickest and strongest guys in my weight class and i 'm probably the most confident too			2
' i 've done enough homework to know i can beat him			0
you 're going to see it all - aggression , intelligence , power and quickness			0
