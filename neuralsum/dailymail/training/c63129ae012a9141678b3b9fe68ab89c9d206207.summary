anger : this poster led to @entity3 officials demanding that the west @entity5 salon that produced it should take it down - they have now asked the @entity8 to intervene it is the must - have hairdo in @entity3			1
in fact it is the only style approved by communist dictator @entity12			2
the @entity13 decreed last month that all young men should follow his short back and sides with centre parting – or face severe punishment			2
but @entity12 clearly did not expect his edict to be taken up thousands of miles from @entity22 in a leafy @entity5 suburb			1
so when his agents saw a promotional poster in a hair salon featuring their leader and his distinctive crop , they leapt furiously into action			2
the @entity3 officials marched in demanding the ‘ disrespectful ’ advert be taken down			1
however , the salon manager took fright at their threatening behaviour and called the police			0
@entity36 , who runs @entity37 in @entity38 , told officers that he feared for his livelihood after using the picture as a joke to promote a discount for men ’s haircuts			1
he chose the photograph following the dictator ’s much publicised edict that all male students in the rogue state must have the same razor - short look			0
below the large image of the tyrant , the poster reads : ‘ @entity55 ? 15 % off all gent cuts through the month of april ’			1
it had been in the salon window for only one day before he received a sinister visit from the @entity3 officials , whose embassy is less than two miles away in a converted semi in @entity62			1
mr @entity36 said : ' i noticed them first outside the shop			1
' they came in and asked what the poster was doing in the window and demanded for it to be taken down			2
' i said it was only a poster and we have pictures of celebrities in the window all the time			2
they said : " this is no celebrity , it 's our dear leader "			0
' they asked for my name and i refused to give it to them , saying " this is not @entity3 , this is @entity86 , and you can get out "			2
' we did take it down but then some of our clients told me to put it back up because we have a democracy here '			0
the two men in suits entered the salon at 4.30pm last friday bearing a clipboard			0
they confronted mr @entity36 ’s 26 - year - old hairdresser son @entity111 , demanding to know who was responsible for the perceived outrage			1
‘ the irony is they did n’t even have the @entity12 haircut , they just had a standard side parting , ’ said mr @entity36 , 51			1
‘ to tell you the truth , it was actually a bit scary			0
from all the stuff you hear about @entity3 , it was worrying			2
the two guys were wearing suits and they were very serious			0
they came in and asked what the poster was doing in the window and demanded for it to be taken down			2
- salon owner @entity36 ‘ i said it was only a poster and we have pictures of celebrities in the window all the time			1
‘ they said , “ we are @entity3 officials , do you know this is our leader ? ”			1
they asked for my name			0
i told them , “ this is not @entity3 , this is @entity86 , we live in a democracy so i ’m afraid you ’re going to have to get out of my salon ”			1
’ the pair left after taking notes and photographs of the premises			2
mr @entity36 went to @entity38 police station to report the matter			1
@entity155 revealed today the @entity3 did the same			1
he initially removed the poster , fearing that either he or the shop could be targeted			2
but following complaints from customers and locals about a ‘ breach of democracy ’ , the poster was put back up , prompting a further visit at 10am the next day			1
a communist official stood outside taking photographs of the salon until @entity111 chased him off			0
mr @entity36 took the poster down after the men left , but he has replaced it after comments on @entity171 saying the request to take it down was a ' breach of democracy '			1
he said : ' the funny thing is , it 's not a bad haircut if he styled it correctly			0
' lots of men are walking around with hair shaved short at the back and the sides , long on the top and big beards - in fact it 's quite like my own style , though it 's all about the face shape			0
' diplomatic incident : @entity190 says his brother @entity191 was forced to go the police because the rogue state 's officials put him under surveillance distinctive : @entity3 leader @entity12 's hair was declared ' bad ' by the @entity199 salon , which led to intervention from his agents his barber son @entity111 , 26 , designed the post and said : ' we put up posters for an offer for men 's hair cuts through the month of april			1
obviously in the current news there has been this story that @entity3 men are only allowed one haircut			0
' we did n't realise but the @entity3 embassy is a 10 minute walk from the salon			2
the next day we had @entity3 officials pop into the salon asking to speak to the manager			1
' the men were a bit stern and abrupt , it was all a bit weird			0
the funny thing is , none of them had the @entity12 hair - cut , they all had normal styles			0
' being over here , they have the freedom to wear their hair any way they like , yet they are trying to tell us what to do			0
' customer @entity237 , who has been using the salon for 20 years , was one of the people who urged mr @entity36 to keep the poster up			1
she said : ' i posted on the @entity171 group about freedom of speech and a friend posted about the freedom to have a laugh			0
' i think the poster 's cool , it 's @entity191 down to a @entity250 i 'm so proud of him for keeping it up			0
' a @entity3 embassy spokesman said they could not comment on the story			0
state headquarters : @entity3 's embassy is based inside this semi in @entity62 , west @entity5 , and officials have asked the @entity8 intervene in a row with a local barbers a @entity263 spokesman said : ' we have spoken to all parties involved and no offence has been disclosed '			1
while @entity37 consider @entity12 's hair ' bad ' , the @entity3 leader is currently forcing all male students in @entity3 to get the same haircut			1
last month his government announced that the only haircut allowed would be the ' @entity274 ' style favoured by @entity12			2
his father @entity274 's hair was given extra volume , apparently to make him look taller			0
his son 's new hair regulation constitutes a clampdown , as previously men had ten styles to choose from			0
women had a menu of 18 haircuts to choose from			0
in 2005 @entity3 state tv launched a five part series entitled ' let us trim our hair in accordance with @entity291 lifestyle ' with the aim of promoting neat haircuts			0
the tv show sent out teams with hidden cameras to catch ' rebels ' who were breaking the @entity3 strict hairstyle code			0
close by : the salon is in @entity38 - just ten minutes from the @entity3 embassy in @entity62			1

@entity37 used picture of @entity12 to promote discount
it said : ' @entity306 ? 15 % off all gent cuts through the month of april '
@entity36 hoped it would *attract* customers to salon in leafy west @entity5 suburb of @entity38
but instead @entity3 officials arrived , taking pictures and notes
later they returned and demanded ' disrespectful ' poster was removed
mr @entity36 agreed but changed his mind because ' this is a democracy '
@entity155 says they *'ve* spoken to both sides but no crime committed
