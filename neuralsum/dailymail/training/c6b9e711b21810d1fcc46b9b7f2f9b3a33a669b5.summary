by @entity0 published : 09:13 est , 15 january 2013 updated : 09:21 est , 15 january 2013 social worker @entity1 has been off sick for ten years after losing a string of legal battles against employers @entity4 a social worker has been off sick for ten years during a £ 45,000 legal wrangle with @entity8 city council over her bullying claims			1
@entity1 last went to work for the council in december 2003 , before being signed off long term sick			1
despite losing a string of battles with the authority - including claims of bullying and disability discrimination - the 54 - year - old , from @entity19 , technically remains a council employee			1
the saga began in 2003 when she fell foul of bosses after leaving work to collect her son from school , despite her claims it had been agreed			1
mother - of - three ms @entity1 , who felt she was being bullied , responded by submitting a grievance after being accused of abandoning a case			1
in december of that year , she was signed off with depression and by 2004 was receiving incapacity benefit			1
she remained off work until january , 2005 , when social services dismissed her through sustained ill - health			2
the last day she worked was december 16 2003			1
while on sick leave she was given six months full pay and 3 months half pay - ending in september 2004			0
although she lost her job over her record of ill health , she won it back on appeal over wrongful dismissal in september 2005 , but she said her career stalled and she her depression hit ' new depths '			2
she later made a failed compensation claim for disability discrimination , spawned by her accusations the local authority failed to make adjustments to help her overcome ill - health			1
the saga began in 2003			0
ms @entity1 won her job back on appeal eight years ago after being dismissed over her record of ill health , but she was then signed of with depression once again after her ' career stalled ' and a civil personal injury claim also fell without being heard			1
now she has been hit with a bill for almost £ 7,000 in legal costs she said : ' my career and life have been ruined by it			2
the effect on my family has been massive and my children have been very affected			0
' the toll this has taken on my health has been catastrophic and continues			0
' in the nine years i 've been off i felt really ill all the way through			0
i 've still got ongoing depression			0
' i 've been incredibly sad - it 's felt like a continuation of the bullying			0
they 've been so heartless			0
' i had been a well respected social worker and the council know they did wrong			0
' i will not let this go because i have been wronged and want an apology , but i do n’t know where i go from here			0
' the council insisted it had done all it could to resolve the dispute and stressed that ms @entity1 , who earned £ 1,200 - a - month , was no longer on the payroll			1
a council spokesman said : ' ms @entity1 took the council to an employment tribunal and the civil courts and both hearings found in the council ’s favour , with the tribunal finding that we had acted in good faith in seeking to resolve matters with her internally			2
' while she remains an employee of the council she has not been well enough to return to work for some time and has therefore not been in receipt of any salary			0
' now legal proceedings have concluded we will seek to work with ms @entity1 to progress matters			1
' we have maintained regular contact with ms @entity1 with the ultimate aim of trying to resolve her on - going employment dispute			2
' all those involved in the matter have been acutely aware of her ill - health and have sought to ensure that matters are progressed in a sensitive manner and as speedily as possible in complex and difficult circumstances			0

@entity1 last went to work in december 2003 , before leaving with depression
since then she has spent £ 45,000 on legal disputes with @entity4
she has launched several *unsuccessful* claims of bullying and disability discrimination
but she has now vowed ' not to give up ' because she has ' been wronged '
