@entity1 supporters sing a song with the line : ' we 're not really here			1
' it sums up the approach of many of their fanbase – they have n't fully bought into the idea that @entity1 could be one of the giants of @entity13			1
celebrity fan @entity14 wants ' the old @entity1 back ' , while rock - @entity17 lover @entity16 says there is ' apathy ' towards the @entity20 among the fans			1
@entity22 could be worried about his position at @entity1 after losing against their fierce rivals ( left to right ) @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 look dejected as they await kick - off after a goal boxer @entity14 , pictured at the @entity32 for a press conference in 2008 , says he wants ' the old @entity1 back ' @entity16 says there is ' apathy ' towards the @entity20 among the @entity1 supporters @entity38 lost by @entity1 in 2015 , one more than the whole of 2014			1
13 - @entity1 's position in the @entity42 form table after losing four and winning two of their last six			1
4 - the first time since losing 4 - 3 to @entity46 in 2009 that @entity1 have conceded four in the league			1
9 - @entity1 have nine points fewer than they did at this stage last season			1
70.8 - @entity1 's pass completion rate percentage at @entity52 was their worst of the season			2
one of the weirdest things i 've been hearing lately is people saying @entity22 was the right man at the right time for @entity1			1
their logic is that his calm was needed after the @entity60 reign ended with a fractured dressing room , and an @entity63 final defeat at the hands of @entity65			0
@entity22 is calm but it was the worst kind of short - term thinking which has led to @entity1 now clinging on to fourth place			1
the dressing room calmed down temporarily , but he does n't have the character or gravitas to galvanise a group of players when the going gets tough			0
he 's punching above his weight at @entity1			2
city need to stop pussy - footing around and drag the fans into the modern game			2
they need to fill up the half - empty glasses of the supporters at the @entity32			2
@entity22 's appointment would have suited those fans who resist the charge towards potential greatness			2
he is not a great manager			0
look at his record before he arrived in @entity87			0
he 's done well but there is no evidence of greatness , and no suggestion of greatness to come			0
@entity93 applauds the travelling fans at @entity52 as he leaves the pitch with goalkeeper @entity96 @entity97 shakes hands with his opposite number @entity22 after the final whistle at @entity52 @entity101 ? @entity102 ? @entity103 ? not even close ... @entity97 should be crowned manager of the year forget @entity105 and @entity106 ... the best player in the @entity42 this weekend was @entity109 's @entity108 and so it has proved			1
the signings @entity1 have made have also smacked of small - time thinking			2
they do n't go for the great players anymore , they 're not in that market			0
@entity114 is the perfect example : he is quick and that 's it			0
he missed a great chance at the start of the @entity120 derby because his end product is so poor			0
he cost a relatively cheap £ 15million , but at 29 years old ( he was signed in 2013 ) , you wonder what the logic was behind this purchase			0
he 's not good enough to be a regular in the starting line - up at a club with ambitions of dominating the @entity20 and @entity42			1
why were n't @entity1 in the market for @entity131 ? @entity132 ? how come they did n't sign @entity133 ? @entity134 is often used as the excuse – it 's holding @entity1 back apparently			1
look at @entity46 , look at @entity136 – be cleverer with the spreadsheets and @entity134 is n't a problem			2
@entity26 and @entity114 prepare for a free - kick at @entity52 as the latter struggles to inspire the side @entity142 is not good enough to be a regular in the starting @entity144 at a club with ambitions of dominating @entity13 @entity1 opted against going in the market for players such as @entity131 ( left ) and @entity133 @entity1 's failure to make any kind of serious progress in @entity13 reflects badly on @entity87 football , but the fault is with the club			1
they need to think bigger and drag themselves towards greatness			0
make big signings , they will improve the team , and if they arrive , they will motivate the big players already at @entity17			0
@entity27 strikes me as the kind of player who will raise his game significantly if he had @entity162 alongside him , rather than @entity164			0
the big message out of @entity1 this season has been how brilliant and shiny their new academy set - up is			1
and it is truly spectacular – a world - class facility			0
but they do n't have the team to match it and they absolutely do n't have the manager			2
if they choose to lose @entity22 , then they need to think big next time and go for a manager showing true potential to be great – like @entity176 or @entity177			1
@entity22 has been accused of punching above his weight at @entity42 champions @entity1 @entity176 ( left ) or @entity177 could be potential replacements for the city manager @entity181 is another that fits the bill if he was to leave current club @entity184 at the end of the season two managers at less fashionable clubs , trying to fight with the big boys in their domestic league and in @entity13			1
or go for greatness itself – @entity181 fits the bill , and so does the man we all expected the hierarchy at @entity1 to deliver – @entity197			0
when @entity198 arrived at @entity1 he declared that he wanted the club to be winning in @entity13			2
they 're still not doing that , and it 's about time @entity1 went to the next level , for their own good , and for the good of @entity87 football			0
it 's like they poked their head out of @entity46 's shadow for a few seconds and got burned by the sunshine			0
think big city , or forever stay small .			0
