@entity0 has praised @entity1 for their handling of the @entity5 - @entity4 battle for this year 's formula one world title			1
from day one , when it became apparent @entity1 would be the dominant force this season , motorsport boss @entity7 made clear he would allow the duo to race			2
there were naturally fractious moments as occurred in @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 , and especially @entity17 where @entity4 chose not to pull out of a crash with @entity5			2
@entity5 celebrates winning the @entity19 after driving to victory in the final race of the season @entity0 ( right ) was pleased to see @entity1 allowing @entity5 and team - mate @entity4 to race @entity5 and @entity4 battled until the very last race of the season before @entity5 took the title that resulted in the 29 - year - old @entity27 being given a severe dressing down by @entity7 who considered imposing team orders at that stage , only to determine it was the wrong approach to adopt. @entity0 , who like @entity4 missed out on the title in @entity34 in 2010 to his then @entity36 team - mate @entity35 , was on the receiving end of a number of dubious calls during his time with the team			1
recognising the efforts made by @entity7 and @entity1 , @entity0 told @entity43 : ' it has been handled impeccably through the whole year between the pair of them			1
' it is everything the way it should have been done , and did happen in the end , with the team giving them both a chance			0
@entity0 ( right ) drove for @entity36 for seven seasons before retiring at the end of last year @entity5 cruises home in @entity34 and the chequered flag is waved to signal his success ' it 's been a good hard battle between two guys from the same team for the first time since ( @entity63 ) @entity62 / ( @entity65 ) @entity64			1
' they handled that advantage incredibly well , which is not easy			0
' @entity0 , now racing in sportscars with @entity69 after retiring from @entity19 at the end of last season , believes @entity4 will bounce back			1
the @entity72 struggled to regain his form after coming so close to landing the title in 2010 , added : ' we had other guys in the game that year with @entity78 ( @entity79 ) and @entity5 there , so it was a bit more intense			2
' i 've openly said ' 11 was difficult for me to come back from what happened the year before because i was going to stop at the end of 2010 , but i did n't			0
i kept going a bit			0
the triumph in the desert sealed a second world championship for @entity90 driver @entity5 @entity5 celebrated with the @entity91 after winning in @entity34 to clinch the world title ' for ' 15 for @entity4 , he has every chance			1
he 's at a different stage of his career than i was , and he 's young , even though @entity5 is in the ascendancy			0
' @entity0 , who attended the final grand prix of the season in @entity34 on sunday , still concedes to loving @entity19 , although feels it is lacking in certain areas			1
' i 've enjoyed this season , ' added @entity0			2
' i enjoy watching the front few guys go at it , and i 'm passionate about @entity19			0
it 's the pinnacle , i want it to be the best			0
' but the depth of the field , the quality of the drivers towards the back of the grid , has dropped off a bit purely because of team funding			0

battle between @entity5 and @entity4 went down to last race
