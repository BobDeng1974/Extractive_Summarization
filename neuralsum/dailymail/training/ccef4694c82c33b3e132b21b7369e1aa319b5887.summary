not all incidents in football are clear or black and white - often there are shades of grey			0
@entity6 ' penalty is one if those			0
@entity8 jinked into the @entity10 penalty area and @entity10 's @entity11 committed a rash challenge and certainly did n't play the ball			1
there was probably a little , almost imperceptible amount of contact which technically makes the challenge a foul			0
@entity6 ' @entity8 ( right ) goes down under the challenge of @entity10 's @entity11 @entity8 ( left ) appeared to go down extremely easily but there was slight contact from @entity11 @entity11 ( centre ) commits to the challenge and ends up sticking his leg in front of @entity8 @entity8 goes down extremely easily and ends up claiming a penalty for @entity6 on wednesday @entity8 did n't dive as there was contact ; however he certainly exaggerated the affect that contact made			1
so , depending on your viewpoint it was either a penalty , and a soft one , or an understandable error from referee @entity35			0
in such cases i always back the referee and , as he gave a penalty , i 'd say he was right			2
@entity39 ( left ) steps up to dispatch the penalty and put @entity6 1 - 0 up against @entity10 @entity39 ( centre ) celebrates with @entity6 team - mates after his goal in the @entity45 fourth - round replay @entity46 ( centre ) celebrates by pointing to the sky after scoring the winner for @entity10			1

@entity10 beat @entity6 *2* - 1 in @entity45 fourth - round reply
@entity6 's goal was scored from the penalty spot by @entity39
@entity8 went down under a challenge from @entity10 's @entity11
there was contact but @entity8 went down extremely easily
in such cases the referee should be back , so his *decision* was correct
