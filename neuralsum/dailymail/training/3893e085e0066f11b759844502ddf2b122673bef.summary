the revelation came as police confirmed that both @entity17 , four , and her older sister , @entity18 , seven , were both ' gradually speaking ' about the massacre			1
they were orphaned on september 5th when a lone gunman opened fire at an isolated layby close to the village of @entity25 , near @entity26			2
their father @entity2 , 50 , was shot dead , alongside their mother , @entity31 , 47 , grandmother @entity32 , 74 , and @entity12 cyclist @entity33 , 45			1
details of police notes about the killings leaked to @entity38 newspaper suggest that @entity17 was sitting upright with the two women in the back of the family @entity42			2
all were wearing seatbelts , but when the firing started , mrs @entity44 had vital seconds in which she was able to unbuckle @entity17 's and shout : ' hide ! ' as bullets sprayed into the back of the estate car , @entity17 would have been able to lie on the floor , and even hide underneath her mother 's skirt			1
she was so well hidden , that police who arrived at the scene after the murders did not at first notice her			2
instead she lay silently for as long as eight hours , until detectives opened the locked doors of the car and found the traumatised child still shaking with fear			2
commenting on @entity38 's report , an investigating source said : ' @entity17 recalls her mother 's instructions to hide			1
she has spoken about her ordeal , and so has her sister			2
they are both gradually speaking			1
' @entity17 was found unscathed , while @entity18 suffered life - threatening injuries , and had to be placed in an artificially induced coma			1
police believe she was pistol - whipped by the gunman , suffering severe head injuries , and a bullet wound in a shoulder			1
murder scene : @entity2 , his wife , @entity31 , and his mother - in - law were all killed in an isolated lay - by near @entity26 in @entity81 scene of a deadly crime : officers are seen inspecting the forested region near @entity25 in south - west @entity81 despite the girls ' horrific ordeal , detectives on both sides of the @entity88 are still confident they may be able to provide vital clues to finding the killer			1
they are currently at a secret location close to the family home in @entity95 , @entity4 , and are being held in conditions of utmost security			2
@entity98 , the @entity26 prosecutor who is leading the investigation into the killings , said their safety was ' paramount ' and confirmed that they had offered ' important information '			2
key lines of enquiry include the possibility that their father was involved in a serious financial dispute with his brother , @entity110 , over a family will			2
there were even claims in @entity38 that former @entity114 dictator @entity113 had paid 840,000 pounds into a @entity115 set up in the name of their father - however these were later denied by the @entity12 police			1
the family are originally from @entity121 , having moved to @entity10 in 1971			2
other lines of enquiry include the possibility that killer was a ' lone psychopath ' , or that mr @entity33 was in fact the main target			2
@entity129 chief prosecutor @entity98 said : ' the hypothesis of a lone and psychologically disturbed killer is gaining ground			0
' evidence the gunman had used an obsolete 7.65mm @entity137 pistol dating back to the 1930s also suggested he was not a professional assassin , police said			0
prayers : @entity2 , 50 , his wife @entity31 , 47 , and her 74 - year - old mother @entity32 , was laid to rest in the same grave last week mr @entity98 confirmed that the @entity12 cyclist had at more bullets in his body than any other victim			1
there have also been reports that he was shot first			0
a source told @entity38 : ' the theory of a family feud is being pushed aside by investigators , who are now looking at the possibility of a lone and psychologically disturbed killer			0
' they have carried out checks at all psychiatric hospitals in the region and are tracking down all patients who may have been recently released or were on day release			0
' they are especially focusing those with previous convictions for gun violence or who were known to be attracted to firearms			0
' investigators are on this basis also contacting gun clubs and hunting clubs in the region			0
but so far they have had no satisfactory results to their inquiries			0
' @entity129 chief prosecutor @entity174 also admitted recently that there was ' no immediate prospect ' of solving the crime			0
he added : ' it 's a long task and there 's nothing that gives hope of a result in the near future			0
' we 're investigating everything but it all takes a lot of time , trying to piece together the lives of all the people who have died , trying to understand a real motive for these killings			0
' perhaps if we can understand why they were killed we can work out who killed them but at the moment there are many questions			1
' i think the investigation will take a very , very long time , unless we discover something that will suddenly enable us to understand everything			0
' there are lines of inquiry but each raises so many questions and nothing suggests there will be a quick solution			0
' the two @entity211 leading the hunt for the @entity12 killer have denied claims that @entity216 secret agents handed over documents proving links between the @entity220 family and @entity113			1
@entity98 , prosecutor in @entity26 close to @entity25 where the massacre took place in september categorically ruled out the claim by @entity38 newspaper which appeared at the weekend			1
the article led to speculation that £ 800,000 in an acccount held by @entity2 in @entity229 had been given to his father by @entity113			1
‘ we are having to cope with questions from the victims ’ families as to why they were not informed of this ’ , said mr @entity98 in an interview with @entity232			0
asked about the @entity239 connection @entity240 , a senior gendarme heading the investigation said : ‘ it ’s not true			0
no secret agent from any country has given us this kind of information ’			0
@entity247 added that speculation as to the order in which the four victims were killed was also false , saying that investigators were still not sure who was killed first			1
latest @entity12 reports suggest the massacre was committed by a mentally deranged killer riding a black motorcyle with saddlebags armed with a @entity137 pistol of a type which was issued to soldiers in the @entity229 army eighty years ago			1
mr @entity44 's father @entity262 was once close to @entity113 's @entity263 , but fell foul of the tyrant in the @entity266 , and fled @entity114 for @entity10			0
cash deposit : it was rumoured that @entity114 dictator @entity113 , left , deposited £ 840,000 into the bank account of murdered @entity2 's ( pictured right ) father @entity262 - a claim later denied by @entity12 police shortly before the dictator was executed in 2006 , it was revealed that he withdraw around £ 620 million from the @entity114 central bank in 2003 , which he had begun to hide around the world			1
the assets would have been added to millions already deposited in accounts in other countries – mainly through @entity114 who had moved abroad			0
@entity113 is known to have concentrated large amounts in @entity229 and @entity81 , where he had at least two homes and moored a £ 17 million yacht .			0
