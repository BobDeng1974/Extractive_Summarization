@entity12 's side , fresh from a 3 - 1 defeat at the hands of @entity15 on july 30 , put in a disappointing performance against their @entity18 opponents , as they created very little going forward and rarely threatened the @entity4 goal			1

@entity3 gave @entity4 the lead in the fourth minute after an uncharacteristic goalkeeping error from @entity32			1
the former @entity80 shot - stopper 's poor clearance fell straight to @entity3 and he made no mistake with his finish			2
three minutes later @entity4 's @entity83 doubled his side 's advantage with a thunderbolt into the top corner from 30 yards			0
given , on this occasion , could do nothing about the goal			0
the hosts continued to dominate proceedings at @entity8 , and shortly after the half - hour mark , @entity93 tapping in from a close - range after a driving run down the wing from @entity38			0
three down at the break , @entity12 resisted making changes until midway through the second half			0
instructions : @entity12 's assistant @entity102 urges his team on during a brief water break at @entity8 digesting : @entity102 does n't look best pleased during @entity1 's defeat , while @entity37 , right , did his best to push on here to stay : @entity1 defender @entity106 , who has been linked with a move away , watched on from the bench @entity27 was one of those introduced , and the @entity110 soon left his stamp on the game with an emphatic free - kick in the 76th minute			1
@entity72 , another of @entity1 's second - half substitutes , was given a standing ovation by the @entity4 fans having played for them for four years between 2009 - 2013			2
despite @entity118 's thunderous set piece , @entity1 continued to look short of ideas going forward , and the @entity110 was at fault for @entity4 's fourth and final goal in added time at the end of the game , as he gave away possession cheaply , allowing @entity21 to sneak in and slot the ball under given .			2
