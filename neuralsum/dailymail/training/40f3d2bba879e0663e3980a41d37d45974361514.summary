rapper @entity1 's debut as a designer at @entity3 may have gone over well with his most devoted fans - but a number of the industry 's elite have spoken out to slam the collection , labeling the musician 's first foray onto the runway as a ' joke ' and a ' disaster '			1
shortly after the 37 - year - old 's collaboration with sportswear brand @entity17 was showcased at a star - studded catwalk show in @entity19 on friday , @entity3 creator @entity14 revealed to the @entity20 that she is ' over ' the musician , adding that his general agenda is ' not her style '			1
' i ’m kind of over @entity1 , ' she said			2
“ i mean , i ’m not a fan of his music , and the attitude and the agenda is not my style			2
renowned fashion publicist @entity35 , who is known by many for her appearance on @entity44 's @entity43 - based reality series @entity42 , also offered up a harsh critique of @entity1 's design attempts , while suggesting that the father - of - one should stick to music and avoid any other fashion - focused ventures			1
' i ’m not into his fashion thing , ' she told @entity53			2
' i think he ’s fine as a rapper			2
i think he ’s a joke as a fashion designer			2
' i just think that you should stay focused at what you ’re good at			0
just because you ’re a good rapper does n’t mean you ’re going to be a good fashion designer			2
' nice try ! @entity1 's questionable fashion fail has already started to spawn its own collection of entertaining memes , including this one which features designer @entity68 @entity35 was also quick to point out that this is not the first time @entity1 's attempts to establish himself as a legitimate designer have failed			1
' i mean , it ’s not , he ’s not legit			0
have you seen the product ? ' she said			0
' did n’t he have his own line in @entity80 , which was a disaster that he spent $ 10 million to do , that no one wore ? ' and it seems that plenty of would - be fashion critics on @entity85 also share @entity35 's somewhat blunt opinion of @entity1 's bizarre collection , which featured a series of unflattering ensembles , including skin - tight nude body stockings which were paired with flesh - colored crop tops			1
' i 'm no fashion guru but i feel like @entity1 is the 2015 version of " the emperor 's new clothes			1
" ' one @entity85 user wrote , while another added : ' i ca n't believe people are actually buying ripped clothing just bc kanye designed them			0
@entity102 give me your clothes & i 'll rip them for free			0
' unimpressed : despite claiming to be incredibly excited at the prospect of showing his @entity17 collection , @entity1 failed to raise a smile when he took to the catwalk bizarre : the collection included a number of unflattering ensembles , which featured skin - tight body stockings and barely - there crop tops ' i mean , it ’s not , he ’s not legit			1

' disastrous : @entity35 labeled @entity1 's collection , pictured , as a ' joke ' and a ' disaster ' fashion friends : @entity1 's show was attended by a whole host of his celebrity friends , including his wife @entity152 ( @entity153 ) , who wore one of his designs , and @entity157 editor - in - chief @entity156 yeezy x @entity159 get army chic ! visit site it should have been all about the models on the catwalk but naturally @entity1 ensured his wife ( and muse ) @entity152 was the best dressed at his @entity17 fashion show yesterday			1
we 're not used to seeing miss @entity169 in anything but form fitting designer duds , but we 're really loving this loose look on her			0
that @entity174 oversized jacket is everything ! unfortunately it 's not available to buy just yet though			0
the reality star has definitely been bringing back this 1990 's trend as of late - she was spotted in a pair of @entity181 camouflage pants just the other day			0
take a page from @entity152 's style files to nab her look with one of the picks from our edit below			0
both @entity188 and @entity189 make high end versions of the trend or opt for a real deal with a @entity194 jacket on sale for only $ 73.95 ! our favorite item here at @entity198 is a @entity200 's mixed media camo bomber , which at $ 140.00 is also a style steal			0
rothco the @entity201 at @entity202 ( now $ 73.95 ) visit site @entity204 at @entity205 visit site @entity207 at @entity208 visit site @entity210 at @entity211 visit site @entity1 's questionable fashion fail has also started to spawn its own collection of ironic memes on social media , with one image of him and designer @entity68 , which was taken at the @entity68 show on thursday morning , proving particularly popular			1
the picture , which shows @entity68 showing some fatherly affection towards @entity1 , alongside the words ' @entity222 try kid but leave the fashion to me ' , has already been shared hundreds of times on @entity85 , with fans labeling it as ' brilliant ' and ' hysterical '			1
thankfully , it seems that @entity1 will always find a fan in his wife , @entity152 , who actually wore one of her husband 's skin - tight ensembles to attend his show			1
alongside an image of herself wearing the spandex design , she wrote on her @entity241 account : ' so proud of my baby ! ! ! ! this moment is here ! ! ! he has worked so hard on this collection ! ! ! '			0

the 37 - year - old rapper showed his first collection , a collaboration with @entity17 , at @entity3 on friday
@entity14 revealed that she is ' over ' @entity1 - and his music
fashion publicist @entity35 also voiced her *dislike* of his designs , labeling his collection as a ' joke ' and a ' disaster '
