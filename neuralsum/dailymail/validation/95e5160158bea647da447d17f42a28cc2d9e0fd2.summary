it 's only full members , pretty much , they 're giving the opportunities to - it may as well be a members ' cup , as opposed to a @entity7			2
' it 's a decision that not only i but a lot of other people completely disagree with			0
if you look at any other sport around the world , they 're looking to expand and develop			0
the way the @entity2 are going , they do n't seem to be doing that really			0
' i think how we 've done , and what we 've shown over the last few years , merits a place at the @entity7			0
but the @entity2 just seem to be shutting doors in your face really			2
' it 's almost getting to the stage of " what 's the point ? " for a lot of the teams			0
if you keep closing the door , they ca n't get on to the world stage			0
@entity71 's century helped @entity1 stun @entity72 at the @entity74 in @entity75 , @entity76 ' i 'd like to know what @entity77 's ( @entity2 chief executive ) vision for the game is			1
it 's not just @entity1 here - we 're talking about a global game			1
' this is the @entity2			0
if his vision for the game is to shrink it and make as much money for the top few nations as possible , then come out and say that			2
' @entity1 narrowly missed out on a place in the quarter - finals of this @entity7 when they were beaten by @entity96 in their decisive group game in @entity98			1
