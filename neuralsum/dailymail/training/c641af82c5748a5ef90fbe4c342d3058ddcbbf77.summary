at some point on wednesday in all probability , @entity0 will walk away from @entity4 ’s @entity3 with his bank balance badly dented but with a weight off his mind			1
best of all , he will be free to concentrate on his preparations for the masters			0
what was supposed to be a day setting out the issues at stake in his bitter dispute with his former management company @entity15 turned into one where his senior counsel @entity16 spoke for a total of less than two minutes			1
three times he asked for adjournments , arguing they were making progress towards a settlement of a case that is due to last for eight weeks			2
three times the judge , mr justice @entity25 , quickly granted his request , with the sides due back in court at 11am on wednesday			0
in all , mr @entity29 spent less time in court than @entity31 spends over the ball			0
@entity0 arrives at the @entity33 in @entity4 ahead of the case involving his former agents @entity0 has sued @entity15 over a bitter row over the fees he was charged while he was with them @entity39 returned to @entity40 after winning the @entity41 on sunday only those well versed in legal ways could possibly explain why an acrimonious struggle that has gone back and forth for 18 months could possibly be settled in 24 hours			1
one thing for sure is that a swift settlement will suit @entity0 , even if it does cost him a not - so - small fortune			1
@entity48 , here he comes			0
the world no 1 arrived in the @entity51 reception area that serves four small courts wearing a dark suit and glasses			2
he was relaxed enough to acknowledge the gathering of golf correspondents with a broad smile that could be interpreted as : fancy meeting you here			2
@entity0 ( left ) seen here with @entity62 sports managing director @entity61 is suing the firm for £ 4.2million @entity0 was in impressive form in @entity65 but now has another challenge to face at the @entity3 in @entity4 inside the intimate courtroom there were barely 50 feet separating those sitting in the back benches from the presiding judge			1
there was a genuine sense of drama as the room fell silent two minutes before the appointed starting hour , followed by the arrival of mr @entity29			0
mr @entity77 rose to his feet			0
‘ the case is listed for eight weeks and there are many issues between the two sides , ’ he said , referring to the fact @entity0 was suing for being locked into an ‘ unconscionable ’ contract until 2017 , and @entity62 ’s owner @entity61 was countersuing for unpaid fees			1
the sports management firm are also counter-suing @entity0 for £ 1.65m for severing his contract early @entity0 gets a kiss from his mother @entity90 after winning the @entity41 for a second time ‘ along with mr @entity93 ( senior counsel for @entity94 ) , we would like to see if we can narrow many of these issues down and that we adjourn until 2pm			1
’ could n’t they have done all this on monday and spared everyone having to turn up ? by the time of the final adjournment and a day as tedious as a rain delay , @entity61 was looking noticeably more relaxed			0
given he ’s already turned down the offer of a € 10million ( £ 7.57m ) settlement , he ’s surely going to be a very wealthy man by the end of play			0
and , as @entity0 said last week in @entity65 : ‘ then we can all get on with the rest of our lives			2
