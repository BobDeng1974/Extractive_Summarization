chances were few in the opening minutes though @entity41 youngster @entity9 saw a 25 - yard shot saved by @entity7 goalkeeper @entity91 , son of legend @entity92			1
@entity7 started to threaten and @entity67 , totally unmarked from a corner , headed the ball into the ground and saw it bounce over the crossbar			0
the contest had been even but @entity1 seized control with two goals in the 10 minutes leading up to half - time			2
first , after @entity42 won a corner , @entity10 's quickly - taken delivery was put in by @entity9 at the far - post , a deflection helping its progress past @entity91			0
