@entity0 is hoping to take full advantage of @entity3 's struggles in front of goal as he prepares to take his @entity7 side back to @entity8 for the second time in under two weeks			1
while the @entity11 head north on a high in the wake of monday night 's 1 - 0 win over @entity14 at the @entity15 , their opponents are looking for their first league win of the season			1
and @entity0 believes his side 's counter-attacking style of play is perfectly suited to capitalising on any frustrations felt by the @entity3 as they push for points at the @entity23			1
@entity7 manager @entity0 is confident his side can get the better of @entity3 at the @entity23 @entity0 , who led his side to a 2 - 1 win over the same opponents in last month 's @entity29 clash , told his club 's official website : ' they seem to be struggling at the moment and drawing a lot of games			1
if they are a bit blunt up front hopefully we can capitalise on that			0
' we 're very much in a positive frame of mind after monday and we 're going into a game against opponents we have played quite recently and overcome			0
' it 's different in the @entity45 - they will make changes and we probably will as well - and they will want to make amends but that may help us to a certain extent because we will always be a threat on the break			2
' @entity54 scored a brace to dump the @entity3 out of the @entity29 in september @entity11 full - back @entity56 spent six years at @entity3 before leaving for the @entity15 this summer and has already tasted victory against his former club having played a full part in the cup success			1
and the @entity62 international wants more of the same this time			0
' we have already been up there once this season and managed to win the game , so hopefully we can use that to our advantage in this game too , ' he told @entity70			2
former @entity3 defender @entity56 celebrates with @entity71 after beating @entity14 ' it was a little bit strange when we went up there last week for the cup game because i spent so long up there , and still have a lot of people i am close to at the club			2
' i 'm a professional footballer though and i am a @entity70 player now			0
my only priority is doing everything i possibly can to help us record the three points from the game			0
' monday 's win over @entity3 's north - east neighbours came at a price with @entity87 limping off with an injury which will keep him out of saturday 's clash			1
@entity87 ( r ) will miss the @entity3 clash through injury but is expected back soon after but @entity0 expressed relief that initial scans on the @entity95 international indicate he ought to be ready to return for the @entity45 clash with @entity97 after the international break			1
@entity0 added : ' with @entity100 it 's not as serious as we initially thought			2
he pulled up sharply and when that happens you fear he will be out for any number of weeks			0
' but he stopped immediately and came off which was the right thing to do			0
the scans show there 's something there but it 's not one that 's going to take too long we hope			0

@entity7 travel to @entity3 for @entity45 clash on saturday
@entity3 are still looking for their first league win of the campaign
@entity0 side beat the @entity120 2 - 1 in @entity29 last month
