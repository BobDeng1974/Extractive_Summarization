researchers have found that the @entity2 outbreak , which killed 774 people , had its origin in @entity6 horseshoe bats			1
scientists discovered two @entity2 coronaviruses ( @entity9 ) in the bats which they claim are very similar to the virus that infected humans			1
the @entity2 ( @entity2 ) pandemic killed around 10 per cent of the 8094 people infected in 2002 and 2003			1
researchers have found that the @entity2 outbreak , which killed 774 people , had its origin in @entity6 horseshoe bats			1
this image is of a @entity17 found in @entity18 @entity19 was commonly reported among the patients and severe complications included kidney failure and acute breathing difficulties			0
scientists now claim the outbreak could have originated from wildlife markets were the bats were kept , or from someone living close to a bat cave			1
@entity6 rufous horseshoe bats , so - called because of the horshoe - shaped bulge on their nose , are found in @entity6 , @entity34 , @entity35 , and @entity36			0
scientists discovered two @entity2 coronaviruses ( @entity9 ) in the bats which they claim are very similar to the virus that infected humans the above image , supplied by the @entity42 , shows the @entity44 's range , predominately in @entity6 , some parts of @entity34 and @entity35			1
they have leaf - like , horseshoe - shaped bulges on their noses			0
the species send location calls through these structures , which scientists believe may serve to focus the sound			0
their hind limbs are not well developed , so they can not walk on all fours			0
however , their wings are broad , making their flight particularly agile			0
they are mostly dull brown or reddish - brown in colour and vary in size from 2.5 cm to 14 cm in length			0
the research team , led by professor @entity67 from the @entity68 in @entity69 found that the viruses in these bats infect human cells in the same way			2
this means that the coronaviruses could in fact move directly from bats to humans			1
the team added that the @entity2 - like coronavirus is around 95 per cent genetically similar to the @entity2 virus in humans			1
previous studies had shown that the sars virus bats carried was close to the one that infected humans			1
the major difference , however was a spike protein which infected human cells was coded in a way so that it disabled the infection			0
scientists theorised that the virus transferred to civets in @entity6 markets , where it underwent the genetic changes to infect humans			2
the finding , which were reported in the journal nature , ‘ definitively confirms ’ bats as the origin of the virus			0
scientists hope their finding will help governments design better prevention strategies for @entity2 and similar epidemics			2
according to the researchers , the finding highlights the importance of protecting the bat ’s natural environment so they are not forced into highly populated urban areas in search of food			0
the research team , led by professor @entity67 from the @entity68 in @entity69 found that the viruses in these bats infect human cells in the same way			2

researchers in @entity69 *uncovered* two @entity2 coronaviruses in the bats
they claim these are 95 *%* the same as sars virus which infected humans
scientists claim the coronaviruses can move directly from bats to humans
