stand out : @entity3 burlesque performer @entity10 , pictured , was granted a green card based on her ' extraordinary ability ' and now tours the @entity9 with her show and pin - up model classes a third of applications were rejected last year , according to @entity35			1
for may , the process took around a year and a half , and required a six - inch - thick dossier to show that burlesque was an art form , and that she was unlike any other performer in the country			1
the file included newspaper clippings from across the country , a tape of her appearance on the ' @entity53 ' , box office sales and letters of recommendation , @entity44 reported			1
' i was a wreck , thinking at any minute they 're going to tell me you have to leave the country , ' she said			1
' it â€™s so hard to live your life that way			2
what do i do if i get kicked out ? ' professional : it took a year and a half and a six - inch - thick dossier to prove that she was the top of her field but the good news finally came last fall after she had spent $ 10,000 in legal fees			1
' i have never been so excited about a piece of plastic , ' may told @entity44			2
' and it 's actually green ! ' may studied political science and worked for the @entity3 government before she found a burlesque troupe that was the beginning of her love affair			1
she decided to leave @entity3 simply because there were more opportunities for her work in the @entity9 ' i love @entity3 and it 's a wonderful country and it 's a great place to live but as an entertainer i really need to be somewhere with a dense population , ' she said			1
' every musical that has ever inspired me in my career is all about going to @entity11 and making it big on the stage			0
i just wanted to be that girl			0
' performer : she said she brings vintage glamor to the art form and channels 1940s stars such as @entity98 she will have to renew the green card after 10 years or she can apply for citizenship in five			2

here for good : she wanted to leave @entity3 as her opportunities as a performer were better in the @entity9 despite being at the top of her field , the fact that a burlesque dancer was given a green card may make it appear they are easy to get			1
