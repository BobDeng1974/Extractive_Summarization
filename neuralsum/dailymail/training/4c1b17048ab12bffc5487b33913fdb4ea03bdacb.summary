@entity0 was suspended for four days for breaking school rules by having @entity2 in his lunchbox and has now been expelled a six year - old boy who was suspended from his school after he took a bag of @entity2 in his packed lunch has now been expelled			1
@entity0 , from @entity8 , near @entity9 , was initially excluded from @entity10 after teachers discovered the snack and called in his parents			1
after a meeting with headmaster @entity15 , they were sent a letter telling them @entity0 would be excluded from last wednesday until monday because he had been ' continuously breaking school rules '			1
but his parents have now said he has been expelled after they spoke to the media , while his younger brother has also been banned from its pre-school			1
the school has insisted a pupil was not excluded ' for just having @entity2 in their lunchbox ' but because there had been a ' persistent and deliberate breach of school policy , such as bringing in crisps , biscuits , sausage rolls , mini sausages , scotch eggs and similar '			1
@entity0 ’s dad , @entity34 , said he was ' devastated ' that the school had not only deprived @entity0 of his schooling but also his younger brother who attends its pre-school			1
he added that a scheduled meeting between the family and headteacher mr @entity15 , due to take place yesterday was cancelled when he arrived			0
mr @entity0 then saw mr @entity15 in the school playground as he picked up @entity0 's brother @entity41 from pre-school but mr @entity15 told him he would telephone him by the end of the day to let him know what was happening			2
minutes later mr @entity0 received a phone call telling him both @entity46 and @entity41 were not welcome back at the school			2
' i ’m just devastated , ' said mr @entity0 , last night			2
' he rang and told me the decision had been made to exclude @entity0 permanently and we had given the school a bad reputation because of the media coverage			2
' he also said the funded sessions @entity41 has at the school ’s pre school were being withdrawn too			0
i think he ’s a coward for not telling me to my face			0
' ' not balanced ' : @entity0 's lunchbox fell foul of the new healthy eating policy at @entity10 primary school the airport worker and wife @entity63 , who is due to give birth to her fourth child next week , are now waiting to hear from education officers from @entity67 to see what to do next			1
in a statement the school said a pupil had been permanently excluded because ' during the course of a recent four day exclusion , the pupil ’s parents made it publicly clear that their child would not be following the school 's policy on healthy eating upon their return '			2
the school also said the decision was taken because of ' the parent school relationship suffering an irretrievable breakdown ' due to ' misrepresentations in the local and national media that were both wholly inaccurate and grossly misleading , abusive language being used towards staff , and other inappropriate actions being taken that were designed to damage the school ’s reputation '			1
the school , which was placed in special measures after @entity96 inspectors deemed it ' inadequate ' in 2012 , introduced a healthy eating policy at the start of term			0
the school has said it was ' extremely disappointing that the media have been provided with such grossly misleading information ' a letter was sent to parents saying that from january 14 , packed lunches should be ' healthy and balanced '			1
parents were told : ' chocolate , sweets , crisps and fizzy drinks are not allowed			0
if your child 's lunchbox is unhealthy and unbalanced they will be provided with a school lunch for which you will be charged			0
' a letter was sent to parents saying that from january 14 , packed lunches should be ' healthy and balanced ' at the time of his exclusion last week , @entity0 's mother @entity63 said : ' we just do not see how they have the right to tell us what we can feed our son			1
' if anything , @entity0 is underweight and could do with putting on a few pounds			2
' miss @entity127 , who is expecting her fourth child , added : ' having a balanced diet also includes eating some carbohydrates , sugars and fats			0
' it is not about excluding some foods , it is about getting the mix right			0
' @entity0 ’s lunchbox usually contains a sandwich , yoghurt tube , @entity141 cheese spread snack , and a packet of @entity2 , with water to drink			2
his mother said the 3ft 9ins tall schoolboy who weighs 3st 2lbs , eats home - cooked meals and plenty of fruit and vegetables at home			0
miss @entity127 said : ' i would understand the exclusion if he was constantly throwing tables around or bullying other children , but it is just ridiculous for a packet of @entity2			0
' surely the headteacher has better things to do with his time than search lunchboxes ? ' a statement released by the school said it was ' extremely disappointing that the media have been provided with such grossly misleading information which has resulted in them running a wholly inaccurate and potentially damaging story for our school '			1
the statement said : ' we have not excluded a pupil for just having @entity2 in their lunchbox , but where there is a persistent and deliberate breach of school policy , such as bringing in crisps , biscuits , sausage rolls , mini sausages , scotch eggs and similar , and all other avenues have been exhausted , the @entity182 would expect further action to be taken			1
government guidelines for school meals suggest food must meet certain nutritional standards so children have healthy and balanced diets			0
according to the guidance , this means there must be high quality meat , poultry or oily - fish , at least two portions of fruit and vegetables with each meal and bread , other cereals and potatoes			0
it also rules out fizzy drinks , crisps , chocolate or sweets in school meals and vending machines along with more than two portions of deep - fried food a week			2
' if we are faced with a situation where a parent threatens to send a pupil into school with insufficient food to sustain them throughout the school day , it is a risk we simply can not afford to happen			0
' the statement went on to say it would only use a permanent exclusion as a final resort ' when all other avenues have been exhausted '			0
it said the school took the decision to permanently exclude a pupil yesterday because of ' persistent breaches of school policies ' and because ' during the course of a recent four day exclusion , the pupil ’s parents made it publicly clear that their child would not be following the school 's policy on healthy eating upon their return '			1
the school also said the decision was taken because of : ' the parent school relationship suffering an irretrievable breakdown that would have put two pupils in an unacceptable position			0
' this breakdown was due to misrepresentations in the local and national media that were both wholly inaccurate and grossly misleading , abusive language being used towards staff , and other inappropriate actions being taken that were designed to damage the school ’s reputation			1
