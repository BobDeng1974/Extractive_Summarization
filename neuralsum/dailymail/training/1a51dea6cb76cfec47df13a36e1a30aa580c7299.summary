by @entity0 from super-sized pastel silk to huge sprays of peacock feathers , the hats worn by racegoers arriving for the second day of racing at @entity4 were elaborate enough to impress even the choosiest of hat connoisseurs			1
day two of the famous race meeting dawned sunny and bright , with racing fans rubbing their hands in glee at the prospect of the @entity15 which this afternoon saw @entity17 guineas and @entity19 winner @entity18 beat the hotly tipped @entity20			1
but even the prospect of the ' duel on the @entity23 ' was n't enough to stop the ladies from vying to be noticed , with yesterday 's demure fascinators giving way to huge wide - brimmed hats and ornately decorated cocktail styles			2
although not quite hitting the sartorial heights of @entity45 , @entity4 is catching up in the fashion stakes as more and more racegoers take the opportunity to dress up for the occasion			1
like its @entity51 counterpart , @entity4 also operates a strict dress code that outlaws jeans and shorts and insists that guests keep their shoulders covered and eschew fancy dress			1
instead , the style guide suggests ' jackets and either ties , cravats or polo neck sweaters ' for gentlemen and ' smart casual ' for ladies , adding that ' due to the terrain and areas of decking at @entity4 , flat shoes are recommended '			2
black and white : racegoers @entity70 ( left ) and @entity71 ( right ) show off their sartorial nous in coordinating black and white ensembles elegant : ladies arriving for the races plumped for a rainbow of different hues , among them punchy cerise , although others played it safe in simple black stylish : they might have a takeaway lunch in their hands but this group of racegoers still managed to look stylish ( left ) as did those arriving for a day out this morning stylish : many of the racegoers at @entity4 plumped for hats in elegant café au lait hues , while @entity95 ( right ) opted for cheerful orange racegoers certainly appeared to be taking those strictures to heart , with no sign of the wacky hats , skintight frocks and skyscraper heels that characterise other meets , most notably @entity104 , although some did brave a day out in high heels			1
on the course , racing action got underway with the @entity109 which was taken by @entity112 bred gelding @entity110 , with @entity17 four - year - old @entity113 in second place and @entity115 in third			0
race number two , the @entity116 saw @entity120 's @entity119 return to winning ways courtesy of three - year - old colt , @entity123			0
with @entity18 , another prince @entity125 steed , taking the ' duel on the @entity128 ' home this afternoon , today has so far proved to a red letter day for the racing obsessed royal			0
another royal who could also be looking at a win today is the @entity134 , whose two - year - old filly @entity135 is among those lining up for the @entity139 ' stakes			0
later this week , her @entity140 winning mare estimate will also return to the track , just weeks after being caught up in a doping scandal traced to a bag of feed contaminated with morphine			0
looking good : racegoers @entity148 ( left ) and @entity149 ( right ) show off their gorgeous be-plumed hats as they arrive at @entity4 stylish : a pair of racegoers keep it simple in elegant cream ensembles bedecked with blooms and accessorised with striking black chapeaux beautiful : a racegoer arrives dressed to the nines and sporting a particularly lovely hat in burned crème brûlée straw trimmed with cream grosgrain ribbon and feathers in bloom : an elegant racegoer opts for a titfer decked with bold blooms - a huge trend among racegoers at @entity45 earlier this summer @entity171 @entity170 : racegoers sporting neat linen suits , panama hats and delicate floral tea dresses appeared to have taken the strict dress code to heart tsunami of titfers : the stands at @entity4 today were a sea of hats , with the majority of gentlemen plumping for stylish panamas wonderful : a pair of racegoers enjoy the action from the comfort of a deckchair set on a hill overlooking the racecourse - said to be the loveliest in the @entity193 while @entity194 is famous for pearls and fur , and @entity104 for its colourfully dressed fillies in fake tan and skyscraper heels , @entity4 's trademark is low key luxury - and flat shoes			1
delicate bejewelled sandals are the most popular with racegoers , as are @entity205 ballet pumps and in the case of some hardened souls , comfortable loafers and deck shoes			0
nevertheless , the meeting is n't short of glamour with plenty of the big , bold , be-plumed hats of the sort seen at @entity51 's @entity45 and neat , nipped - in shift dresses reigning supreme in the paddock			1
as at @entity45 , racegoers have a strict dress code to contend with which insists on smart - casual in all areas and outlaws bare shoulders and any sort of fancy dress			1
' @entity4 is famous for being a stylish yet relaxed occasion , ' continues the style guide , ' and gentlemen are required to wear jackets and either ties , cravats or polo neck sweaters in the @entity232			2
' linen suits and @entity234 are traditionally worn by gentlemen			0
jeans and shorts are not permitted in the @entity232			0
