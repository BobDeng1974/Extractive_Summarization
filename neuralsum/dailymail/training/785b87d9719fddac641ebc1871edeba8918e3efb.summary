by @entity0 published : 05:50 est , 9 august 2013 updated : 06:36 est , 9 august 2013 most of us try to drop a few winter pounds before we head to the beach on our summer holiday , in vague effort to look a little less wobbly in a bikini			2
but once we 're propped on a sun lounge and offered an ice cream the diet goes whizzing out the window , and we 're all wolfing down second helpings of tatziki , noodles and paella before you can say ' is today my five day or my two day ? '			2
almost 80 per cent of us will gain weight during our annual break , returning home with an average 8ln of ' excess baggage ' , according to studies			0
and it takes us a month of strict dieting to lose it once we 're back at work			0
most people kick the diet when they go on holiday and just eat whatever they want , returning 8lbs heavier and spending a month trying to shift the excess baggage @entity34 is the worst place for holiday waistlines , with visitors gaining an average of 8lbs over two weeks thanks to the country 's enormous portions and all - you - can - eat buffets only an extremely self - restrained four per cent of @entity43 say they pay attention to the nutritional content of the food they eat on holiday , and although 93 per cent of us attempt to eat local cuisine , barely any consider to check its nutritional value			1
nearly three quarters of travellers confess to tucking into holiday favourites such as rib eye steak , moussaka , pizza and @entity59 duck without a care			0
and 79 per cent of us gain weight as a result			0
but rather than @entity63 or @entity64 , @entity34 is the worst place for holiday waistlines , with visitors gaining an average of 8lbs over two weeks thanks to the country 's enormous portions and all - you - can - eat buffets , an amount that will take most people a month to lose			1
not far behind the @entity34 , the neighbouring @entity73 is also one of the worst offenders , with its all - inclusive resorts securing second spot in a ' holiday fat map ' : those questioned gained on average 7.4lb on their trip			1
@entity81 and @entity64 , with their wines , cheeses , creamy sauces and pasta are listed as the third and fourth , with @entity88 gaining 7.3lb while abroad and @entity64 food - lovers a round 7lb			1
despite most of us trying to drop some winter bulge before getting into the dreaded bikini , we tend to bin the diet as soon as we get to our holiday destination only an extremely self - restrained four per cent of @entity43 say they pay attention to the nutritional content of the food they eat on holiday , though 93 per cent of us attempt to eat local cuisine the studies by @entity101 and @entity102 blamed larger portions for putting on weight and the same number said it was down to ' lounging around '			1
@entity107 , senior nutrition and health manager at @entity101 told @entity110 : ' it is amazing just how much hard work people put in to being healthy before they go away - and then once on holiday they do n't give it a second thought			0
' she added that there were some easy ways to avoid cholesterol - busting dishes abroad such as limiting deep - fried food and creamy sauces and asking for dressings , butter and sour cream on the side			0
a separate study revealed that of the 42 per cent of people who said they dieted before a trip abroad , two thirds have piled the pounds back on by the end of the vacation .			2

almost 80 ***%*** of us ditch the diet as soon as we go on holiday
worst place for gaining is @entity34 , followed by @entity73 , @entity81 and @entity64
93 ***%*** of us attempt to eat local cuisine while abroad
some 42 ***%*** of @entity143 diet before a holiday
