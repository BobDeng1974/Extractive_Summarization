' i will take the honour in beheading you ... when you are least prepared ; my men and i will take your office by surprise			0
' senator @entity0 , who 's been a vocal critic of @entity14 @entity5 law since her debut in @entity6 politics , maintains she will not be intimidated by the letter and will continue to advocate for harsher penalties intended for those fighting with the @entity37			1
the letter received by @entity40 's office on friday along with three images of a man being beheaded ' obviously someone is trying to intimidate and scare me			2
i will not be intimidated or scared			0
' i will continue to advocate for a ban on @entity5 , unnecessary face coverings in public and tighter regulation of @entity48 certification fees in @entity6 - and to have those @entity6 citizens who assist @entity37 in any way , charged with the high crimes of @entity52 or @entity53			0
' a personal security assessment is currently underway to ensure the safety of @entity40 following the threats			0
police are currently investigating ' two lines of inquiry '			0
firstly , that the letter was sent from a person opposing the erection of a mosque in @entity65 's northern suburbs , alternatively the threat may have been issued by @entity37 group members or supporters of the @entity70 siege gunman , man @entity69			0
the threat follows senator @entity0 's controversial statements about her intentions to overhaul the @entity6 citizenship oath and reintroduce death penalty for those accused of treason			1
teenage defector @entity79 , from @entity80 in south - western @entity70 , is among those who have taken up arms for terror groups and would be put to death under senator @entity0 's plan ' it 's time we adopted a much tougher approach to people who are @entity6 citizens and have fought or are now fighting alongside our enemies , or assisting them , ' she said			1
' in those cases the @entity6 laws are very clear			0
@entity6 citizens who take up arms against members of our @entity95 ( @entity95 ) are guilty of treason			2

@entity6 's awaiting death : @entity107 ( pictured right ) and @entity108 ( pictured left ) have been sentenced to death by firing squad despite pleas from the @entity6 government to spare their lives ms @entity0 believes revoking citizenship or trying to rehabilitate @entity118 fighters returning to @entity6 is a waste of time , and more importantly , dangerous for the @entity6 public			1
' part of my solution to help defeat @entity118 is to re-introduce the death penalty as a sentencing option for @entity6 juries who find our citizens guilty of treason , ' she said , specifying the crime as taking up arms against @entity6 military personnel			1
ms @entity0 is pushing for treason charges to be laid against all ex-australians who have taken up arms with terror groups such as @entity118 ' putting terrorists and would - be terrorists in jail will only turn our prison systems into recruiting centres for @entity14 extremism			1
