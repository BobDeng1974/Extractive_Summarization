he saved the lives of countless youngsters through two decades of campaigning about road safety			1
so when a new generation of smartphone - obsessed grown - ups began ignoring simple rules for crossing the street , there was only one solution : send for the @entity11 ! today the fearless crusader dons his big green boots again for a new drive to persuade people not to text , make calls or listen to music while crossing the street			1
’ and while we ’re about it – watch where you ’re going instead of at your phone			0
granted , our resurrected hero is not quite as sprightly as he was			0
but anything he can do to halt the rise in accidents is surely good news for pedestrians ( not to mention any drivers who do n’t fancy getting a texting 20 - something on their car bonnet			0
) yesterday he told me : ‘ you see people wandering across the road with their eyes glued to their phones , or oblivious to what ’s going on around them because they ’re wearing huge headphones over their ears			1
in real life i ca n’t really walk up to people and tell them off because i ’d probably get punched			2
but road safety is a real passion point for me , so i ’m happy to help			1
’ the crusader dons his big green boots again for a new drive to persuade people not to text , make calls or listen to music while crossing the street it is hoped the online 21st century version aimed at grown - ups will be as successful as the 1970 campaign mr @entity20 , a married father of three who is also celebrated for his role as @entity79 in @entity80 , was made an mbe by the @entity82 in 2000 for his contribution to road safety			1
deaths and injuries involving children dropped dramatically during the campaign , sponsored by the @entity29 , which began in 1971			2
now it is hoped an online 21st century version , sponsored by more th > n insurance , will have similar benefits for grown - ups			0
one of the new films shows a young father pushing a pram into the road between parked cars while texting			2
mr @entity20 has not lost his ability to scold offending pedestrians : ‘ what do you think you ’re doing ? ’ he asks , before instructing him how to cross properly			2
the actor still owns his trusty @entity105 , a small robot that helped him underline the original road safety message			1
( he kept it in the shed at his @entity109 home for 30 years before a @entity111 society volunteered to restore it last year			0
) he has also kept hold of the original outfit , although thankfully he was n’t required to wear the improbably tight leggings he sported as a younger crusader			0
‘ i ’m afraid i ca n’t get in them any more , ’ he admits .			0
