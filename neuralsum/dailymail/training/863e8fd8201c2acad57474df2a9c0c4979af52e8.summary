by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 10:41 est , 25 october 2012 updated : 20:19 est , 25 october 2012 forming a majestic gatehouse from @entity4 to @entity5 , it will certainly be able to offer rooms with a view			0
after years housing civil servants ’ dilapidated offices , @entity9 , one of @entity12 ’s best - known landmarks , is to become a luxury hotel , it was announced yesterday			1
and with @entity17 , the @entity18 developer behind the glitzy @entity19 in @entity20 , heading the project , it should be eye - catching at the very least			1
majestic : @entity9 , one of @entity12 's best - known landmarks , is to become a luxury hotel some critics have panned the @entity26 – the most expensive place to stay in @entity28 , with even the cheapest rooms from £ 850 a night – for its ‘ brash ’ and ‘ tasteless ’ decor , dubbing it the ‘ @entity32 ’			1
now mr @entity17 ’s @entity12 - based firm @entity34 has bought @entity35 - listed @entity9 for £ 60million , there is talk of ‘ subtle illuminations ’ on the outside , and a sumptuous ballroom and spa inside			1
but at a press conference to unveil the sale yesterday , mr @entity17 was quick to stress that the 100 - year - old building ’s period features will be painstakingly preserved as part of the deal			1
when the arch ’s sale was announced last year , it was contingent on the building being made accessible to the public for the first time , with a museum mooted as an option			0
national celebrations : the building has been part of many celebrations , including the @entity60 procession this year , over the last century five - star luxury : @entity34 intends to convert the building into a five - star 100 - bedroom hotel with royal and presidential suites , a ballroom , spa and fine dining restaurant turning it into a five - star hotel will inevitably invite criticism that the arch will be accessible only to the super-rich			2
mr @entity17 said the hotel should attract 50,000 guests a year in its 100 guestrooms , with a further 50,000 visiting its bars and restaurants , which will be open to the public			2
the development will also create hundreds of jobs			0
with nearby six - bedroom houses on the market for £ 30million , £ 60million might seem a snip			0
but the deal is to restore the arch during a 99 - year lease , a project which will probably cost hundreds of millions			0
spread over eight storeys , the 147,300 sq ft building is not being used at present , is falling into disrepair and has £ 900,000 - a - year running costs , which cabinet office minister @entity92 said amounted to a ‘ tragic waste of an historic building ’			0
affair : @entity96 and @entity97 at his private flat at @entity9 , february , 2006 @entity99 history : @entity101 march through the arch on @entity103 in may 1937 inside the arch : used as the @entity106 headquarters , the public has rarely seen inside the building			2
cabinet minister @entity92 said the plans ' will bring this @entity12 landmark back to life ' ' great shame ' : in the 100 years since it opened , the building has had virtually no public access , including the south block staircase , but mr @entity92 says that the government wants to ' preserve it for future generations ' no decision has yet been made on what the hotel will be called or who will run it			2
the team will liaise with the government on the security implications , due to its sensitive position overlooking @entity127 and the @entity128			0
@entity5 has been consulted , while the government retains the freehold and still has the final say in its development			0
the sale does not include @entity133 , next door , which dates from 1788 and has provided grace - and - favour apartments for politicians including former deputy prime minister @entity96			0
property investor @entity17 is also behind the @entity19 in @entity20			1
room prices start at £ 850 and that 's before service charges , tips and refreshments @entity143 : the @entity26 is the @entity28 's most expensive hotel			1
despite this , it is almost always completely booked glitzy : another view of the interior of the @entity26 hotel in @entity20			1

@entity9 is one of @entity12 's best - known landmarks
it is to be converted by @entity18 developer @entity17
@entity17 is the man behind the glitzy @entity26 hotel in @entity20
