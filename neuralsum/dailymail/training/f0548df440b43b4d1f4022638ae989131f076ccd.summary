by @entity0 thousands of travellers are arriving in the small @entity3 town of @entity4 this morning as they prepare to take part in the annual horse fair			1
the week - long event attracts members of the gypsy community from around the world , and has previously been featured in popular @entity13 show @entity11			2
however this year 's @entity14 has already been hit by a row over an ' invasion ' , as a large number of traveller families have pitched cars , caravans and horse buggies on the town 's privately owned golf course			1
the horse fair , which runs from today until next wednesday , is the largest and one of the oldest fairs of its kind anywhere in @entity82			1
travellers and horse dealers gather at @entity4 , in @entity87 , in the @entity75 , @entity27 , to meet old friends , conduct business , but primarily to trade horses			1
traditionally they bathe the horses in the @entity75 before grooming them and riding them fast along the ' mad mile ' to show them off to potential buyers			0
as well as horses , the fair also features market stalls selling food and other merchandise , as well as fortune telling , palm reading and other live entertainment			0
activities : with thousands of horses gathered , travellers take them into the lakes surrounding the plush fields between striking deals to buy or sell clutching a rope for her own horse , the woman prepares to ride neck - deep into the lake with her companion who apparently intends to wash the horse three - year - old @entity119 from @entity120 sits with her dog @entity122 on the steps of a bow top caravan as gypsies and travellers gather during the annual horse fair roots : a young traveller in a flat cap and tweed jacket is seen driving a simple buggy along a country road near @entity4			1
the horse fair , which runs from today until next wednesday , is the largest and one of the oldest fairs of its kind anywhere in @entity82 history : many travellers wear traditional dress during the week - long event			1
@entity29 granted a @entity73 in 1685 allowing a horse fair to be held ' near the @entity75 ' , and every year thousands of travellers come from around the world to take part learning the business : a young traveller and his father bring one of their horses under control			1
every year thousands of travellers gather in the town to trade the animals			2
traditionally they bathe the horses in the @entity75 before grooming them and riding them fast along the ' mad mile ' to show them off to potential buyers the event remains one of the largest and oldest events in @entity82 and gives the opportunity for travelling communities to meet friends , celebrate their music , folklore tradition : @entity172 from the @entity173 has a cup of tea as he sits on the steps of his @entity178 top wagon where gypsies gather to buy and sell horses buy or sell : the festival took over the entire town , with horses tied up to barriers along the streets for would - be buyers to have a look at this girl galloped into the water fully - clothed to give the black and white horse a wash before she takes to the field to barter ahead of this year 's fair , pubs and off - licences in @entity4 have agreed to limit opening hours in the hope of reducing anti-social behaviour			1
it is thought that up to 10,000 travellers and an additional 30,000 spectators will arrive in the small town over the next few days			2
the sheer number of people , plus previous incidents of drink - related disorder , have encouraged local businesses to agree to only serve alcohol between midday and 11pm over the course of the week			2
police are out in force to control the event , which caused havoc last year			2
pubs and restaurants have agreed to stop selling alcohol at 11pm to quell the hype while many bring their horses and other fare in wheel - driven caravans , locals cart over the @entity75 in rickety carts that perilously scale the hills anger : the @entity14 has already been hit by a row over an ' invasion ' , as a large number of traveller families have pitched cars , caravans and horse buggies on the market town 's privately owned golf course			1
the fair runs until next wednesday , so it is unlikely the vehicles will be moving anytime soon perfect pitch : the arrival of the travellers at the golf course has caused anger among local residents			1
every year @entity4 suffers from drink - related disorder , anti-social behaviour and a build - up of discarded litter and human waste during the week - long event large numbers : it is thought that up to 10,000 travellers and an additional 30,000 spectators will arrive in the small town over the next few days			1
ahead of this year 's fair , pubs and off - licences in @entity4 have agreed to limit opening hours in the hope of reducing anti-social behaviour trouble : police keep a close on those taking part in the @entity14			1
the event has gained a reputation for violence in recent years , leading to a heavy police presence			2
last year officers arrested around 20 people who were on their way to @entity4 on suspicion of conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm the @entity14 has been held every year in early june since 1685 when @entity29 granted a royal charter in 1685 allowing a horse fair ' near to the @entity75 '			1
however many gypsy historians say it has been taking place for at least 500 years with some believing it goes all the way back to @entity278			1
originally an event for trading livestock of all types it became known as a specialist horse fair owing to its popularity among gypsy traders			2
it traditionally begins on the first thursday after the first tuesday in june and ends on the following wednesday			0
in 1965 @entity287 attempted to shut down the event but were forced to back down after a huge outcry			0
deals are made by one - to - one bartering rather than a traditional auction and are clinched with a slap on the hand			0
@entity295 , @entity296 's chief executive , said : ' a great deal of preparation has gone into the planning of this year 's fair to help people enjoy the event safely			1
' ' this work includes pubs and off licenses signing up to a voluntary charter and having the street cleansing operation in place throughout the fair , so that the impact of this event on the local community is minimized as much as possible , ' he added			2
with its rolling hillsides and lush green pastures the countryside around @entity4 is some of the most beautiful in @entity77			0
but last year 's event was blighted after some of the travellers left piles of rubbish , including used nappies and broken bottles strewn around hedges and fields prompting a flurry of complaints from locals			1
with bin bags , cardboard boxes and scraps of food lining the hedgerows and roadsides , local people and the authorities faced a massive clean - up operation			0
many were left furious with the mess left behind with some accusing @entity296 of not doing enough to clean up			0
one irate local described the scene as being like ' an open sewer ' claiming the portable toilets were overflowing			0
the man , who did not wish to be named , said : ' they got serviced once a day			0
' they are filthy and overflowing			0
you would n't let your dog use them			0
' mr @entity295 said that , in response to these concerns , @entity296 has allocated additional street cleaning facilities both during the fair and to assist the clean - up operation afterwards			0
the event has also gained a reputation for violence			0
last year police arrested around 20 people who were on their way to @entity4 on suspicion of conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm			2
that followed a series of bare knuckle brawls in 2011 when several arrests were made			0
the 2009 event saw over 100 arrests mostly for drunkenness , drugs and disorder with police seizing cocaine , cannabis and 127 ball bearing guns			0
27 of the arrests were made after rival gangs were involved in a mass brawl			0
entire clans come together to the specialist horse fair , where deals are made by a slap on the hand and a simple exchange of livestock thoroughfare : horses were not the only animals to sweep the @entity3 town - this woman , and many others , also brought household pets such as dogs despite the cast - over weather , travelling and @entity394 crowds flocked to the fields to parade their caravans , a tradition dating back to 1685 preparations : the fair is @entity82 's largest gathering of @entity394 which the community spends months preparing for travellers look delighted to be riding horses in the lush green pastures of @entity4 ( left )			1
