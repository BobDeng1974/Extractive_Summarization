@entity1 officials are searching for a rapid outcome after being left in the unsatisfactory position of having to potentially make significant changes to its prestigious @entity5 2015 two - year - old programme			1
the race switches will mean schedules published in diaries and calendars , important sources of information as racegoers plan visits to the @entity17 - owned track , will be out of date			2
it also means further upheaval at a venue which controversially lost the @entity22 to @entity23 in 2011 much to the annoyance of many of its regular attenders			2
@entity1 are considering making significant changes to its prestigious @entity5 2015 schedule definitely moving is the @entity28 , which will revert to its tradition slot during the @entity30 on saturday 26 september			1
the one - year experiment of staging @entity32 day 24 hours before @entity33 at @entity23 appears over while a new option of running the @entity35 on saturday 10 october has still to be confirmed			2
@entity36 , regional director of the @entity17 ’s @entity37 , welcomed the new date of the @entity39 but conceded both the composition and date of other race days had still to be finalised			2
@entity36 said : ‘ we can move of the @entity35 but it does not mean we will			0
we will act in the best interests of @entity1 , the @entity17 and @entity46 racing			1
there are a number of options and we are working through them with the @entity51			0
’ the latest changes have been sanctioned by the @entity53 which agrees race slots on the international calendar			1
@entity56 ( left ) says the @entity53 have reluctantly given their approval staging the six - furlong @entity39 and seven - furlong @entity58 on the same future champions day card was another controversial 2011 move			1
the fact there should now be the traditional two - week gap between the races will be seen as a victory over the fixture - list tinkermen , who pay little attention to tradition			1
@entity56 , chairman of the @entity53 , said : ‘ having the @entity39 over six furlongs and the @entity35 over seven furlongs on the same programme is not ideal			1
‘ the @entity46 authorities initially came to us with these changes and believed in them at the time			0
somewhat , reluctantly the @entity53 gave its approval at the time and we are now going back to a preferable outcome			1
it is still not perfect but it is an improvement			0
’ the switches in the @entity46 fixture list have been allowed because the @entity84 authorities requested the @entity85 , run at the @entity87 meeting , be extended from seven furlongs to a mile , so not presenting a proximity clash with the @entity58			0
@entity90 's @entity89 could run in saturday 's galliardhomes.com @entity91 at @entity93 meanwhile , @entity90 's @entity94 hope @entity89 is a fascinating possible entry in saturday 's galliardhomes.com @entity91 at @entity93			0
the gelding , a winner at the last two @entity98 , has failed to win in his two steeplechase runs this season , unseating at @entity101 in december on his last effort			0
but his record at the @entity30 means he is still prominent in the @entity94 betting			0
entries for the @entity91 , a notable trial for the @entity106 in march , also include @entity108 - trained @entity107 , who reverts to hurdles after failing to complete on two of his three novice chase starts , beat that , @entity114 , at @entity115 , novice @entity116 , and @entity117			2
trainer @entity118 is hoping his @entity121 winner many clouds can take another step towards the @entity94 when he runs in the @entity123 at the course on saturday .			0

@entity1 are considering making significant changes to its prestigious @entity5 2015 schedule as @entity28 reverts to traditional spot
the @entity53 have reluctantly given their approval
