the sister of @entity2 journalist @entity1 , who is being held hostage by @entity5 militants , tonight urged the terror group to ' restart dialogue ' with his family			1
in an emotional appeal , @entity9 said that the family had been in contact with the terrorists , but that recent messages have been ignored			1
ms @entity9 said it was ' frustrating ' that their line of communication had been cut off and ' strongly ' challenged the group to return to ' their previously opened channel '			1
in the video that was released on monday night , ms @entity9 said that she was speaking ' on behalf of the head of the @entity9 family , ' referring to her father @entity35 who is terminally ill. her brother , a photojournalist who has worked for newspapers including the @entity25 , was kidnapped in @entity37 two years ago			1
in recent weeks the 43 - year - old captive has featured in a number of propaganda videos released by the @entity28 extremists and apparently wrote an article for the group 's @entity43 magazine			2
referring to her brother 's appearance in the videos and article , ms @entity9 said his ' words are powerful and have huge resonance '			1
speaking directly to camera , ms @entity9 said : ' we , @entity1 's family , want to address @entity5 , who are holding him			1
' it is not true to say that there has been no attempt to engage with @entity59			2
it is simply not accurate			0
' this is frustrating for all parties , including those who are trying to assist us			0
we had previously been in contact through a channel started by you , but then this stopped for reasons best known to you			0
ignored : ms @entity9 said that recent messages to the terrorist group through a ' previously opened channel ' of communication had been ignored ' sadly , like the families of @entity78 and @entity79 before they were killed , our efforts at re-opening dialogue continue to be ignored by those holding @entity1			1
' we strongly challenge those holding @entity1 to return to your previously opened channel , to which we continue to send messages and await your response so that in keeping with everyone 's wishes , we can restart dialogue			1
' we implore is to reinitiate direct contact			2
' ' terminally ill ' : in a direct televised appeal to @entity5 , @entity90 , 80 , who has throat cancer , asked his jihadist captors to return him home safely to those who love him earlier this month mr @entity1 's sick father issued a heartbreaking plea from a hospital bed for his son ’s release			1
in a direct televised appeal to @entity5 , @entity90 , 80 , who has throat cancer , asked his jihadist captors to return him home safely to those who love him			0
he said his efforts to communicate with the militants had only been met with silence and he could only hope they had received them			0
speaking about watching the original footage of his son , he said : ‘ for the first time in almost two years , we saw @entity1 when he made a televised broadcast during which he told viewers that he was still a prisoner of the @entity5 and that maybe he will live and maybe he will die			2
‘ as a family we experienced great relief seeing and hearing @entity1 and knowing that he is alive			2
this was followed by the feeling of despair and helplessness			0
’ addressing his son ’s captors , he said : ‘ to those holding @entity1 : please know that he is a good man , he sought only to help the @entity37 people and i ask you from all that is sacred , to help us and allow him to return home safely to those he loves and those who love him			0
’ the parents of the captured @entity133 aid worker @entity132 , formerly known as @entity134 , also said they were trying to contact is with messages and videos but did not know if it was working			0
his mother @entity138 told @entity139 : ‘ i do not know if it is working but i have got to try because i need to know i ’ve done everything i can do			0
’ the videos of mr @entity1 , who is originally from @entity142 , have all followed the same format , with the journalist sitting at a desk against a black backdrop to address the camera			2
there are no signs of violence in the videos but , in the first , mr @entity1 made it clear he was speaking as a prisoner whose life was in danger			2
appeal : in a statement released tonight , his sister @entity9 said it was ' frustrating ' that contact with her family has stopped the terrorists last night released a fourth propaganda video featuring the @entity2 hostage , in which he blamed the @entity2 government for beheadings by jihadis in @entity37			1
in a video clip posted online , the abducted photojournalist told how the terror group ' eagerly awaited ' a ground war with @entity133 and its allies			1
he also accuses western governments of spending millions of pounds on ' @entity175 - style ' military action instead of paying ransoms to his captors			0
in the chilling 6min 53sec film , mr @entity1 said he expected to be executed , adding ' i await my turn			0
' in a further development , in a long article apparently written by mr @entity1 for @entity59 's @entity43 magazine , he insists he writes the scripts to the videos in which he appears			1
in last night ’s professionally - produced video , the captive – wearing a @entity188 - style orange jumpsuit – said a battle against the fanatics where no one ‘ gets their hands dirty ’ was impossible			0
so far , a 40 - nation coalition led by the @entity133 and including @entity2 as well as @entity198 nations have carried out air strikes while ruling out combat troops			0
mr @entity1 , who appeared to be delivering the message under duress , added that the beheading videos were a ‘ win - win ’ for the militant group			1
however , it appears the film was shot before the murder of @entity79			0
delivering scripted lines , mr @entity1 said the decapitation of ‘ three previous cellmates ’ by @entity5 fanatics had shocked the public			0
but taxi driver mr @entity79 was the fourth @entity215 hostage to be executed , after @entity133 journalists @entity216 and @entity218 and @entity2 aid worker @entity78 .			1
