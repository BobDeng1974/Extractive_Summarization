@entity0 will stay at @entity1 after talks with @entity4 owner @entity3 in @entity5			1
@entity0 ’s position was uncertain with the club up for sale for £ 200million , but he will continue as manager while working under similar cash guidelines as before			1
that means he will get funds to use in the transfer window but there will not be the substantial lift in budget he insisted was required to see @entity1 avoid another season of struggle			2
testing times : @entity0 watched his side win 10 of 38 @entity24 games and finish in 15th place the emphasis , though , will be on signing players of proven quality – rather than making speculative acquisitions – with quality promoted over quantity			1
in the past two summer transfer windows @entity0 has spent a net £ 20m and £ 13m respectively , and the same scale of finance should be made available despite @entity3 wanting out			1
@entity37 is a top target and would be available for nothing having seen his @entity41 contract expire – but wages present a large obstacle to overcome			0
@entity44 : @entity41 defender @entity37 ( right ) is wanted by @entity1 manager @entity0 kitty : @entity1 boss @entity0 is keen to sign two or three key players this summer while @entity37 may prove out of reach the 31 - year - old defender represents the kind of player @entity0 wants to bring in to ensure his team have a more experienced core next season			1
despite @entity0 ’s call for more money going unheeded , the @entity52 will not walk away from the club he joined in 2012			2
@entity0 said : ‘ as everybody is aware , i met with the chairman along with @entity0 ( @entity58 , chief executive ) and i ’m determined to get on with the job of managing @entity1			2
‘ these circumstances are extremely challenging as the club is for sale and as far as i know there is nothing imminent in terms of new ownership , but we ’re going to roll up our sleeves , prepare for the battle ahead and do our best by the club			2
for sale : @entity73 's @entity4 owner @entity3 is looking to sell the club for £ 200m ‘ the squad requires strengthening , that ’s self - evident , and it wo n’t be easy within the current circumstances			1
but we ’ll look to identify players of proven quality to bring in and get ready for the start of the new season			0
‘ to the fans , my message is simple - this is your club and it ’s a fantastic club			0
your support has made it into this			0
‘ the past two seasons have been tough and expectations , rightly , are high			0
but success is always built on everybody working together and the circumstances now require us all to pull together and stick together and try to galvanise ourselves for this challenge we face			0
‘ i ’m determined to give it everything i have , the players will do the same and it is our collective strength as a club which , ultimately , will see us through			0

@entity0 's position at @entity1 was uncertain as the team struggled
@entity1 finished on 38 points and in 15th place in the @entity24
owner @entity3 has put the club up for sale
@entity109 is looking for £ 200m
