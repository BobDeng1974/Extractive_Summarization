by @entity0 the @entity1 is investigating a ‘ military - style ’ attack on a @entity4 electric power facility earlier this year			1
the april 16 attack saw as many as two gunmen storm the @entity8 substation after severing phone service and fire several dozen rounds at transformers			1
federal officials took over the investigation from local law enforcement on fears it was linked to the @entity16 only a day earlier , but those fears appear to have subsided			1
at least one person , maybe two , went down multiple manholes at the facility in a @entity22 suburb and cut fiber cables leading to the substation , according to @entity25 , which detailed the well - planned attack			2
attacked : the @entity1 is investigating an april attack on @entity8 's @entity29 substation			1
experts have warned the assault could have been a ' dress rehearsal for a larger attack ' this knocked out 911 and landline service o the substation , as well as cell phone service to the surrounding area			1
@entity8 employees had no means to call for help when , at 1am , as many as two gunmen began their attack			0
more than 100 rounds were fired from high - powered rifles at many transformers – 10 were damaged in one area and three transformer banks in another , a @entity8 spokesperson told the site			1
cooling oil leaking from at least one transformer bank caused transformers to overheat and shut down			2
this led officials to warn locals to conserve energy , but no major power outages occurred			0
no major damage or injuries were sustained either , but a stalled local investigation led the feds to take over the case			0
cables cut : at least one suspect cut communications cables along this highway and another before shooting up the substation no major damage : transformers were shot at over 100 times , but no serious damage was sustained , nor was anyone injured ‘ initially , the attack was being treated as vandalism and handled by local law enforcement , ’ a senior intelligence official told @entity25			1
‘ however , investigators have been quoted in the press expressing opinions that there are indications that the timing of the attacks and target selection indicate a higher level of planning and sophistication , ’ the official explained			0
the @entity1 was initially worried that the attack was somehow linked to the april 15 @entity16 , but further investigation showed it to likely be an isolated local event , an agency spokesperson told @entity25			1
a @entity8 official disagreed with that assertion , and told @entity25 the attack was ‘ not amateurs taking potshots … this was a dress rehearsal			0
’ lit up : the @entity100 sheriff 's office released this surveillance footage of the attack which shows the gunshots going off on the grounds of the @entity8 facility @entity106 flew : no one was injured and the power did n't actually go out in the area because the state grid was able to maintain it but officials fear that it was a test run the agency is following a couple of leads , but has yet to name any suspects			2
no one has claimed responsibility			0
the @entity1 is also investigating a series of attacks on the @entity123 power grid where multiple high - voltage transmission lines were severed and one substation was set on fire , according to the @entity127			2
‘ you should have expected @entity131 ’ was scribbled on a control panel at the torched substation			0
there is no indication the attacks in @entity123 and @entity4 are related .			0

as many as two attackers cut all phone service - both landline and *cellular* - to @entity8 's @entity29 substation
over 100 rounds of *ammunition* were fired at several transformers
