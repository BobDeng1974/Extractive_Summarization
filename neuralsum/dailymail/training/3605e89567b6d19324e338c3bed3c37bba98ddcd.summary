by @entity1 reporter published : 17:37 est , 19 december 2012 updated : 17:00 est , 29 may 2013 deal : sgt. @entity4 ' lawyer said that he will be pleading guilty in an effort to avoid the death penalty , which the @entity7 was seeking in his case after he reportedly killed 16 @entity11 villagers in a predawn rampage in march the @entity7 said wednesday it will seek the death penalty against the soldier accused of killing 16 @entity11 villagers in a predawn rampage in march , a decision his lawyer called ' totally irresponsible			1
' the announcement followed a pretrial hearing last month for staff sgt. @entity4 , 39 , who faces premeditated murder and other charges in the attack on two villages in southern @entity11			1
the slayings drew such angry protests that the @entity27 temporarily halted combat operations in @entity11 , and it was three weeks before @entity27 investigators could reach the crime scenes			1
prosecutors said @entity32 left his remote southern @entity11 base early on march 11 , attacked one village and returned to the base , then slipped away again to attack another nearby compound			1
of the 16 people killed , nine were children			1
no date has been set for @entity42 ' court martial , which will be held at @entity43 south of @entity44			0
his civilian lawyer , @entity45 , said he met with @entity7 officials last week to argue his client should n't face the possibility of the death penalty , given that @entity32 was serving his fourth deployment in a war zone when the killings occurred			1
' the @entity7 is not taking responsibility for @entity32 and other soldiers that the @entity7 knowingly sends into combat situations with diagnosed ptsd , concussive head injuries and other injuries , ' @entity54 said			1
' the @entity7 is trying to take the focus off the failure of its decisions , and the failure of the war itself , and making sgt. @entity32 out to be a rogue soldier			1
' @entity42 ' wife , @entity68 , said in a statement wednesday that she and their children have been enjoying their weekend visits with @entity32 at @entity43 , and she hopes he receives an impartial trial			1
changing tales : @entity32 ' lawyer says the army should take greater responsibility for sending soldiers into combat who are suffering from ptsd and head injuries , but now he seems grateful for the plea deal ' i no longer know if a fair trial for @entity86 is possible , but it very much is my hope , and i will have faith , ' she said			1
@entity32 ' defense team has said the government 's case is incomplete , and outside experts have said a key issue going forward will be to determine if @entity32 suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder			1
@entity32 grew up in the @entity95 suburb of @entity96 , @entity97 , and served tours of duty in @entity100 and @entity11			1
during last month 's preliminary hearing , prosecutors built a strong eyewitness case against the veteran soldier , with troops recounting how they saw @entity32 return to the base alone , covered in blood			1
@entity11 witnesses questioned via a video link from a forward operating base near @entity112 described the horror of that night			1
a teenage boy recalled how the gunman kept firing as children scrambled , yelling : ' we are children ! we are children ! ' a young girl in a bright headscarf recalled hiding behind her father as he was shot to death			2
bodies of @entity11 civilians , allegedly shot by @entity27 soldier staff sergeant @entity4 , loaded into the back of a van in @entity127 village of @entity129 district , @entity112 province an @entity7 criminal investigations command special agent testified earlier that @entity32 tested positive for steroids three days after the killings , and other soldiers testified that @entity32 had been drinking the evening of the massacre			1
prosecutors , in asking for a court - martial trial , have pointed to statements @entity32 made after he was apprehended , saying his comments demonstrated a ' clear memory of what he had done , and consciousness of wrongdoing			1
' several soldiers testified at a hearing that @entity32 returned to the base alone just before dawn , covered in blood , and that he made incriminating statements such as , ' i thought i was doing the right thing			1
' the @entity27 military has not executed anyone since 1961			0
there are five men currently facing military death sentences , all for murders committed stateside , according to the @entity163			0
@entity164 , charged in the 2009 rampage that killed 13 and wounded more than two dozen others at @entity167 in @entity168 , also could face the death penalty if convicted ; no date has been set for his court martial			0
for @entity32 to face execution , the court martial jury must unanimously find him guilty of premeditated murder			1
they also must determine that at least one aggravating factor applies , such as multiple or child victims , and that the aggravating factor substantially outweighs any extenuating or mitigating circumstances			0
innocent : @entity68 told @entity182 last month : ' my husband did not do this			1
i truly believe from the bottom of my heart that my husband is not involved ' @entity32 , a father of two from @entity190 , @entity191 , joined the @entity7 in late 2001 - after the 9/11 attacks - as his career as a stockbroker imploded			1
an arbitrator entered a $ 1.5 million fraud judgment against him and his former company that went unpaid , and his attempt to start an investment firm in @entity200 also failed			0
he was serving his fourth combat tour after three stints in @entity100 , and his arrest prompted a national discussion about the stresses posed by multiple deployments			2
@entity68 maintains that her husband is innocent and was not responsible for the senseless slayings			1
speaking to @entity182 last month , she said she finds it ' incomprehensible ' that her husband and best friend , ' @entity86 , ' faces 16 charges of premeditated murder			1
' it does n't seem possible			0
especially that there were women and children , ' she said			2
' my heart goes out to those families that lost loved ones , parents and grandparents			0
i am a mom ; i ca n't imagine losing my child , especially to something like that			0
' ms @entity32 said she learned of the attack within hours from military officials and her initial reaction was that ' it must have been a mistake			1
' ' it certainly was n't , it was n't my husband , ' she said			2
' i know my husband			2
i know him very well , and especially the talk about the women and the children			2
i knew that it was n't my husband			2
so it was just incomprehensible to me			2
' speaking to her husband in the middle of that march night confirmed to her that even he did n't know what really happened			2
' he was like , ' what ? what you talking about ? ' he had , he knew that something was going on , but did not know the extent of what was going on , and i was actually the one that had told him how many people had died , and that included women and children , and he was blown away			2
he did not know the details as they had been portrayed in the press			0
' a courtroom sketch of staff sgt. @entity4 , third from left , during his hearing last month but @entity68 told @entity182 she believes the truth has yet to come out			1
' i do n't think we have even begun to have the truth			0
' in the meantime , ms @entity32 said she finds it hard explaining to the couples ' two - year - old son and five - year - old daughter why their father is sitting in a jail cell			2
' it 's been difficult , ' she said			2
' i question myself , what is the right thing to say , what is the right thing to explain to them , what can they understand ? and for me , i do n't even really understand what is happening , so how can i possibly expect my kids to understand , right ? ' but the family regularly travels the to where @entity42 ' has been calling home			0
their conversations are monitored but at least , she says , they can be a family			0
' we are together , we 're as a family			0
we 're regular ; we can look forward to it			0
we know when we are going to see him again			0
it 's somewhat normal , ' she said			0
to help pay what could end up being millions of dollars in legal fees , ms @entity32 has set up a website , @entity294 , where people can donate to the @entity296			2
' really the reason we need a defense fund is to get a fair trial out of this			0
i really feel @entity86 gave his best for his country			0
now it is time for @entity27 to give their best to him			0
' she told the tv station that she tries not to dwell on the possibility that her husband may spend his life behind bars or worse , face the death penalty			0
' i have come to terms with that , and that i have put away			0
you know , i thought about it and i put it away until i actually have to deal with it			0
so you , i have learned to compartmentalize a lot of these issues , too			0
yes , i 've thought about it and yes , that scares me			0
