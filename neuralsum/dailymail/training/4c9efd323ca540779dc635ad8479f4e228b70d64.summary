@entity0 and @entity1 are too reliant on @entity2 , according to former @entity4 captain @entity3			1
the 19 - year - old has been the best player at @entity7 this season and he has become an increasingly effective player for the national team			1
against @entity12 in the @entity13 last week @entity0 's game plan appeared to consist of just getting the ball to the teenager at any opportunity and he even played the second half as a striker after misfiring @entity19 was substituted			1
@entity2 is challenge by @entity22 's @entity21 during @entity0 's 0 - 0 draw at @entity7 on saturday @entity0 manager @entity24 issues instructions to @entity2 on the @entity7 touchline but while @entity2 's talent is not in question , @entity3 believes he is being asked to do too much when there are more experienced players around him who should be shouldering the burden			1
' it is true ( @entity0 ) are placing a lot of responsibility on him but the same can be said of @entity1 and if they are relying on a 19 - year - old kid then i think it does not reflect well on @entity1 's group , ' he said			2
' the same can be said for @entity0 : if you are relying on a 19 - year - old to deliver in big games for you it is not how it should be			2
' @entity2 has been by far @entity0 's most potent attacking threat this season @entity3 also criticised @entity0 's defensive organisation and believes they have to get back to basics before they can get through their current malaise of conceding sloppy goals			1
' they are conceding bad goals now and if you are doing that it drains confidence and they must be at that point now , ' said the @entity54 , who was speaking on behalf of @entity55 , the credit card company which sponsors the @entity57			2
' it is not about what type of football you are trying to play ; you can play the football you want but if you are conceding poor goals it drains confidence			0
@entity0 's defence scramble to try and stop a goal at @entity66 earlier this month ' @entity0 have to get back to stop giving away daft goals - especially at set - pieces - and then start again and rebuild confidence			1
' from where they were last year to where they are now they are a team playing without great confidence			0
' it is not just about back four and goalkeeper ; if your midfield is working hard to stop quality balls being played into your back four the defence has a far better chance to deal with the crosses			0
' but they are not putting the ball under pressure and the guy is able to cross it			0
' former @entity0 captain and manager @entity3 poses with the @entity57 trophy captain @entity86 , so effective in a deep - lying midfield role last season has struggled to impose himself on games in the current campaign but @entity3 believes it is too early to write him off			1
' i think @entity86 can play in that position for at least another season after this one with the proviso he has the right player around him ; @entity97 plus one other , ' he said			0
' he still has the range of passes and he is still passing it better than anyone else at the club but he needs people either side of him as they are a little bit light in there			0
' @entity3 believes @entity0 captain @entity86 has been exposed this season in midfield @entity0 host @entity109 in the @entity57 on tuesday and @entity3 believes it is a competition they should take seriously despite the glamour of the @entity13			1
' it 's a great opportunity for @entity0 to win a trophy , ' he added			2
' you can never play in enough cup finals or win enough medals			0
when you 've been to a final and won a cup you want it again and again and it gives you that inner belief you can do it again			0
' @entity3 was speaking on behalf of @entity55 , credit card company and sponsor of the @entity57 .			0
