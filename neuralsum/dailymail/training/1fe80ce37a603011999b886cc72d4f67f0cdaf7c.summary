@entity1 officials this week warned children and the elderly to stay indoors due severe smog			1
it has become a major problem in @entity9 's capital city and elsewhere in the country - forcing closures , damaging health and reducing visibility to less than 10 metres			2
the solution , according to @entity15 designer @entity14 , is to use an electronic vacuum cleaner to clean up the air			0
a heavy smog shrouded @entity26 yesterday for the second straight day , forcing the closure of schools and highways walking on : a woman wearing a mask walk through a street covered by dense smog in @entity26 , northern @entity9 uphill battle : visibility shrank and small - particle pollution soared to a record 40 times higher than an international safety standard in the northern @entity9 city as the region entered its high - smog season @entity14 has been working with the mayor of @entity1 to use the technology in a new park in the city , according to @entity50			1
the system uses copper coils to create an electrostatic field that attracts smog particles to clean the air			1
this creates holes of clean air through the smog which can be as large as 60 metres , according to mr @entity14			1
‘ it 's a similar principle to if you have a statically charged balloon that attracts your hair , ’ mr @entity14 told @entity50			0

choking clouds of pollution blanketed @entity26 , in @entity9 's @entity27 province , which is famed for its annual ice festival @entity1 officials this week warned children and the elderly stay indoors due severe smog			1
it 's an increasing problem that forces closures , damages health and reduces visibility to less than 10 metres @entity14 has developed an ' electronic vacuum cleaner ' that can remove smog from urban skies and is working with the mayor of @entity1 to use the technology in a new park in the city ‘ if you apply that to smog , to create fields of static electricity of ions , which literally attract or magnetise the smog so it drops down so you can clean it , like an electronic vacuum cleaner			1
’ by making a weak electromagnetic field ( similar like static electricity that attracts your hair ) the smog components in the air are pulled down to the ground where they can be cleaned			1
this creates gigantic holes of clean air in the sky , which can be as large as 60 metres , according to @entity14			1
the coils can be buried beneath the grass of a park and are release no toxic residues			2
he added that the coils can be buried beneath the grass of a park and release no toxic residues			2
this combination of high - tech and imagination is what mr @entity14 calls ‘ techno - poetry ’			0
mr @entity14 's company has been working with scientists at the @entity122 to unveil a working prototype of the system			0
he now plans to spend a year and a half developing the technology before deploying it in a park in @entity1			0
the @entity130 and @entity15 - based designer has also been working on intricate designs like a sustainable dance floor which generates electricity when you dance , and smart highways which produce their own light			0
the @entity9 government has announced plans over the years to tackle the pollution problem but has made little apparent progress meanwhile , visibility shrank and small - particle pollution soared to a record 40 times higher than an international safety standard in one @entity9 city as the region entered its high - smog season			2
winter typically brings the worst air pollution to northern @entity9 because of a combination of weather conditions and an increase in the burning of coal for homes and municipal heating systems			0
for the large northern city of @entity26 , the city 's heating systems kicked in on sunday , and on monday visibility there was less than 50 yards , according to state media .			0

the coils can then be buried in the ground and leave no toxic residue
