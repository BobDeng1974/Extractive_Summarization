i tried to run out onto the veranda to scream			0
and while he told my daughter to stop her brother from screaming , he carried on hitting me			0

there ’s been a murder "			0

’ the @entity22 is now set to issue a damning report on how @entity87 was ' let down ' by @entity88 , after officers dropped her home minutes before she was attacked the @entity22 has now published a damning report into the matter - saying @entity88 did not give the case any urgency or priority			1
commissioner @entity97 said : ‘ no - one took overall supervision and this failure to join the dots effectively put this woman and her children at serious risk			0
‘ @entity88 had the systems and intelligence in place to flag up the danger that this offender presented , but at various stages officers failed to access that information and to assess that risk properly			1
’ @entity14 was released on licence from prison for previous offences in 2007 - and later began a relationship with @entity8 who said she had ‘ no idea ’ of the extent of her partner 's criminal past			1
however , she began to feel vulnerable as the months went on and in august 26 , 2011 , made a statement to police saying @entity14 had assaulted her			1
the @entity22 said @entity88 could not immediately find @entity14 at the time			1
three days later , while away from her home , the woman contacted officers again saying @entity14 had been at her address insisting she drop the charges against him			1
an @entity22 report said : ‘ she asked for police to meet her ( because ) ... she felt unable to return home			1
‘ with her two young children , she waited for over two hours for the police to arrive			0
‘ she was taken to a police station , where she made a further statement			0
an officer later drove the woman and her children home			0
within minutes of the officer leaving , the partner forced entry into the locked flat and attacked the woman with a hammer			2
’ the @entity22 said there had been a ‘ continuing thread of low level performance ’ by police officers and 999 operators in the lead up to the attack and said one officer had a case to answer for misconduct			1
‘ @entity88 had the systems and intelligence in place to flag up the danger that this offender presented , but at various stages officers failed to access that information and to assess that risk properly			2
’ - @entity22 report another officer and three control room staff should also be subject to management over poor performance , its investigation concluded			1
it also said the force - which is the biggest in @entity18 - should have referred the matter to the @entity22 at the time it happened			2
the @entity22 said it was only made aware of the issue when local mp @entity170 complained on the woman 's behalf			2
‘ the police only made limited efforts to apprehend a potentially violent sex offender , ’ the @entity22 said			2
‘ police had correctly documented and recorded all their intelligence , but did not use that information well in dealing with the escalating situation			0
‘ a notice to the @entity181 may not have prevented the serious assault , but it could have resulted in the offender 's licence being revoked and his swift return to custody			0
’ the watchdog has recommended @entity88 reviews its training for domestic violence situations - especially where children are involved			2
@entity88 deputy chief constable @entity191 said : ‘ it is clear we did not provide the victim in this case and her children with the care and protection that she needed at a critical time and we are sincerely sorry for that			2
‘ over recent years we have worked incredibly hard to improve our response to incidents of domestic abuse			0
‘ while this has come too late to support the victim in this case , we have good evidence it is providing a much improved response to victims of domestic abuse now , helping to keep them safe			0
’ @entity88 and crime commissioner @entity211 said : ‘ the events should not have happened as they did			2
the deputy chief constable made that absolutely clear			0
‘ the thing is there have been failures in the past , which is why the chief constable made tackling violence against women and girls such a high priority in the police and crime plan			0
