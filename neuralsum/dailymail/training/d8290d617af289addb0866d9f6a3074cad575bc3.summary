high earner : @entity1 is pictured getting into his white @entity2 in @entity3 earlier this year a @entity5 footballer facing a driving ban told magistrates he could not afford a chauffeur - despite earning a reported £ 10,000 per week			1
@entity9 defender @entity1 was expected to have his licence taken away after being caught doing 48mph in a 30mph zone			1
the 24 - year - old defender already had nine points in his licence but pleaded that a ban would cause him ' exceptional hardship '			1
despite being given a further four points he did not have his licence taken away immediately under the ' totting up ' procedure because his lawyer announced that he would be appealing			1
pleading for leniency , the footballer told @entity23 yesterday he could be sold by his club and that fears for his baby daughter 's health had caused tension between him and his girlfriend @entity29			2
standing in the dock he revealed how his daughter @entity31 has just been released from intensive care after being born three months premature			2
he said the baby suffers from a bowel disorder which requires regular medical attention - meaning he has to make emergency dashes to hospital			2
he told the court : ' it 's been tough for both of us			2
our baby girl came out of hospital a few weeks ago but then she caught a virus and had to go back in			1
' she came out on friday but we have to take her to hospital at least twice a week			0
' she 's still only seven and a half pounds and has problems feeding			0
' he added : ' she has problems feeding			0
my partner ca n't just get up in the morning and feed her and take me to training			0
' with everything going on we have been arguing a lot , there 's things we need to work on but it 's not about us			0
it 's about our little girl			0
' ' exceptional hardship ' : @entity1 , pictured here in action for @entity9 , told the court he could not afford a chauffeur			1
he earns a reported £ 10,000 per week when asked by prosecutor @entity67 if he could not hire a chauffeur if he lost his licence , @entity66 replied : ' i do n't see a chauffeur as an option because they cost a lot of money			2
' i 'd have to rely on teammates and taxis			0
i earn less money than most @entity5 players although i am on good money			0
' @entity66 's barrister @entity81 later put it to him that he 's no @entity84 in terms of his salary			0

the money i 've got i want to invest for the future '			0
he was caught by a speed camera doing 48mph in a 30mph zone in his @entity92 near the club 's training ground on april 13 this year			1
the right - back , from @entity97 , @entity9 , admitted the charge , but claimed ' exceptional hardship '			1
the court heard the footballer has nine points on his licence including an offence of speeding in may 2008			1
