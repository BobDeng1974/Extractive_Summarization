as holiday companies cancel trips to @entity6 ’s capital following this week ’s massacre of 20 foreign tourists at a museum , the threat @entity0 could pose to @entity2 holidaymakers has been brought sharply into focus			1
the harrowing revelation that a @entity13 woman died in the attack in what is regarded as a moderate @entity17 nation has raised the possibility that the influence of these hate - filled terrorists has spread to other @entity22 and @entity23 countries popular with @entity2 holidaymakers			1
with the @entity27 holidays near , many @entity2 people must now question whether once apparently safe destinations have been infected by the barbaric @entity0 ideology			1
gun guard : @entity31 ( security forces pictured ) has high security at its prime tourist resorts and at the @entity35 a spokeswoman for travel watchdog @entity37 said that while @entity2 tourists tend to be quite resilient and have a ‘ level - headed ’ view of terrorist threats , holidaymakers should consult the @entity42 before travelling			1
but how safe are traditional destinations for @entity2 travellers ? @entity6 the shootings in @entity6 , which has a fledgling democracy , could severely damage the country ’s tourism trade			1
its holiday industry had made an impressive recovery since the @entity52 in 2011			2
that year , 408,000 @entity2 nationals visited , rising to about 420,000 last year			0
after wednesday ’s attack , the @entity42 issued advice not to go to the area surrounding the museum ‘ until further notice ’			1
while 6,500 @entity2 tourists in @entity6 are mainly in the coastal resorts ( where security is higher ) , holiday operators such as @entity60 and @entity61 have stopped day excursions to the capital			1
the @entity42 classifies the threat of terrorism as ‘ high ’ across all of @entity70 , advising against all travel to borders with @entity73 ( pictured , @entity70 soldiers stand guard on the @entity70 - @entity73 border ) @entity70 more than two - and - half million @entity77 fly to @entity70 each year			1
while most visit @entity23 resorts , many head for @entity80 , its cultural and historical heart			0
in recent months it has emerged that @entity2 youngsters infatuated with @entity0 have flown there and travelled south to slip into war - torn @entity73			1
while most popular resorts are hundreds of miles from the @entity73 border , there are still active terrorist groups in the whole country , some inspired by @entity90			2
the @entity42 classifies the threat of terrorism as ‘ high ’ across all of @entity70 ( the same as in @entity92 following the @entity94 shootings ) , advising against all travel to borders with @entity73			1
last year , a car bomb at a petrol station near a border - crossing killed dozens of people			2
in january , a banned @entity101 group used a suicide bomber to kill a policeman in @entity80 ’s @entity104 , near the @entity106 and @entity107 museum , the city ’s most famous attractions			0
@entity31 resorts such as @entity111 on the @entity112 have made @entity31 a top winter sun destination for @entity2 families			0
at one point 9,000 @entity2 visitors were at that resort on any single day during peak season			0
but the country has been rocked by political turmoil since the overthrow of @entity122 in 2011			0
after the country descended into military rule after the overthrow of the @entity128 , the number of tourists visiting dropped by 25 per cent			2
political demonstrations , sometimes leading to violence , are commonplace			0
an @entity31 soldier stands guard in @entity134 's @entity133			0
the @entity42 says that terrorist attacks continue to be planned throughout @entity31 , although they are aimed at security forces in @entity134 and @entity137 the political instability has led to a series of deadly bomb attacks in the capital , @entity134 , usually targeting soldiers , police and businesses			1
but , the influence of @entity0 in the country is increasing			1
last september , an @entity90 spokesman issued a chilling online call to arms to @entity31 radicals saying : ‘ if you can kill a disbelieving @entity151 or @entity152			0
including the citizens of the countries that entered into a coalition against the @entity0 , kill him			1
’ in november the @entity161 - based , @entity160 - inspired @entity159 ( @entity158 ) group pledged allegiance to @entity90			0
and last year , a suicide bomber blew up a bus killing three @entity166 pilgrims on a trip to @entity168 near the @entity31 - @entity170 border crossing			0
tour operators halted excursions to the monastery			0
the @entity42 advises against all travel to @entity161 , and only essential travel to much of @entity176			1
however , holiday resorts including @entity111 , @entity178 , @entity179 , @entity180 , @entity181 and @entity111 are deemed safe because of the high security patrols and vehicle checks			2
anyone landing at @entity111 or @entity186 airports can not fail to spot the armed military presence			0
the advice adds that terrorist attacks continue to be planned throughout @entity31 , although aimed at security forces in @entity134 and @entity137			0
you are also advised not to go near the @entity193 border or anywhere remote in case of kidnapping			0
@entity196 ( pictured , @entity196 security forces outside the @entity199 embassy in @entity200 ) has borders with @entity73 and @entity199			0
recently , there has been growing concern that @entity0 is garnering support there the @entity207 cities of @entity208 and @entity209 have seen grenade attacks and shootings at public gatherings @entity213 in 2011 , @entity213 ’s reputation as a country relatively free from extremism was shattered when an explosion ripped through a @entity219 restaurant in a popular tourist spot			1
in total , 17 people perished and 20 were injured when a bomb hidden in a handbag detonated at the @entity226 café			2
most of those killed were tourists , including one @entity229 and a group of @entity92 students — one only ten			1
it was the first major terror attack in the country for eight years			0
about 400,000 @entity2 visit the country each year , often to see @entity219 , as well as @entity235 and @entity236			0
while the @entity42 warns of a ‘ general threat ’ from terrorism — the same it gives for @entity151 and @entity240 — it says the government there has recently raised its level of vigilance due to the conflicts in @entity73 and @entity199			1
concern about the possible influence of @entity90 was compounded last year when it released a video featuring eight @entity213 is members who said they ‘ intend to bring jihad to @entity213 soil ’			0
@entity252 this emirate on the south - east coast of the @entity255 is the financial and tourist hub of the @entity258			0
holidaymakers who have booked to go to @entity6 will likely be feeling nervous , but experts advise checking your travel insurance small print before changing or cancelling you booking			1
most tour operators take their advice from the government ’s @entity42			1
it offers travel guidance for all countries , and flags up when areas are too dangerous			1
@entity271 means all is fine amber means all but essential travel should be avoided , and red means you should n’t travel there under any circumstances			2
while this week ’s horror in the @entity6 capital @entity281 is unsettling , @entity277 , of @entity278 , points out that the country ’s beach resorts will still be considered safe			1
@entity6 ’s coast is shown in green — except in the far south east towards the border with @entity193			1
the west of the country bordering @entity289 and the south neighbouring @entity193 are amber or red			0
situations such as these highlight why it ’s so important to take out your travel insurance as soon as you book your trip , instead of waiting until the last minute			2
unfortunately , if an area is still classed as safe to travel then your insurance policy wo n’t cover you if you incur fees for changing or cancelling your booking			2
conversely , if you travel to a destination which has been flagged as unsafe you ’ll invalidate your insurance			2
find @entity42 travel information at www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice about a million @entity2 tourists visit every year			1
while @entity17 terrorists have largely left it alone , the government said it foiled a plot in 2012			2
the @entity42 again says there is a ‘ general ’ threat of terrorism which could target ‘ @entity2 interests ’ , adding that ‘ attacks ca n’t be ruled out and could be indiscriminate , including in places frequented by foreigners ’			1
@entity196 for more adventurous travellers , @entity196 has become increasingly popular			2
even no - frills airline flights travel there , taking people to see ancient sites such as @entity322 , @entity200 and @entity323 , as well as the @entity324			2
the country does , however , share borders with @entity73 and @entity199			0
recently , there has been growing concern that @entity0 is garnering support there			1
in february , the @entity151 @entity331 published a warning after receiving information that up - market shopping malls in @entity200 would be targeted , probably in a terrorist attack similar to the shooting in the @entity338 shopping mall in @entity207			0
although , the @entity196 government stepped up security patrols , @entity151 embassy staff and their citizens were advised to avoid shopping centres			0
the @entity42 says there is only a ‘ general ’ threat of terrorism in @entity196			2
@entity207 the capital @entity208 and @entity209 have had spates of grenade attacks and shootings at public gatherings			0
six @entity2 nationals were among those killed in the @entity338 in @entity208 in 2013			0
the @entity42 says there is a ‘ high ’ risk of terrorism , advising against travelling near borders with @entity358 , where the @entity360 militant group is based and kidnappings of @entity362 are more likely			1
referring to the @entity338 shootings it says ‘ further attacks are likely ’ , adding that coastal areas where many beach resorts are have also been targeted .			0
