@entity0 will today seek to quell unrest over ‘ bribes ’ for @entity3 – as senior @entity4 insist laws giving @entity6 equivalent powers must be passed within months			1
the prime minister has invited 20 mps , including some of his fiercest backbench critics , to his country retreat , @entity12 , to thrash out plans for ‘ @entity6 votes for @entity6 laws ’			1
many conservatives say powers over tax , welfare and spending must only be ceded to @entity21 if @entity3 mps are barred from voting on them at @entity23			2
@entity0 is committed to the timetable for devolution agreed by the three main party leaders , according to a @entity28 source @entity3 ’s first minister @entity29 , who is to stand down after last week ’s no vote on independence , yesterday claimed mr @entity0 had tricked @entity3 voters			1
but no 10 sources insisted that he was committed to the timetable for devolution agreed by the three main party leaders			1
‘ no ifs , no buts , that will occur , ’ said one			0
plans for @entity6 votes for @entity6 laws would be unveiled at the same time , in january , but separately , the source said			1
all three party leaders will face uproar from many mps if they press ahead with powers for @entity3 but not @entity6			2
the prime minister has invited 20 mps , including some of his fiercest backbench critics , to his country retreat , @entity12 , to thrash out plans for ‘ @entity6 votes for @entity6 laws ’ @entity3 ’s first minister @entity29 claimed mr @entity0 had tricked @entity3 voters @entity47 chief whip @entity46 said at the weekend it would be ‘ impossible ’ to hand powers to @entity3 without reassessing the status of @entity3 mps at @entity23			1
mr @entity0 said on friday that further devolution must take place ‘ in tandem with , and at the same pace ’ as the dilution of @entity3 mps ’ rights			1
the no 10 source said : ‘ these issues will be considered in parallel and at the same time			0
’ but mr @entity29 said no voters would feel ‘ tricked ’			0
he told the @entity62 ’s @entity61 : ‘ the prime minister wants to link change in @entity3 to change in @entity6			1
he wants to do that because he has difficulty in carrying his backbenchers on this and they are under pressure from @entity70			0
’ former @entity72 chancellor @entity71 , leader of the @entity74 campaign , told the @entity76 programme : ‘ the agreement reached by the three parties , as far as i am concerned , is non-negotiable			0
anyone who welches on that will pay a very heavy price for years to come			0
there is a separate issue about what further constitutional change comes to the @entity88			0
’ @entity89 , head of the 1922 committee of @entity4 , said it was likely @entity50 would only approve powers for @entity3 alongside a move to @entity6 votes for @entity6 laws			1
mr @entity89 , invited to @entity12 with former frontbenchers @entity95 and @entity97 , said it was a ‘ basic principle of fairness and justice ’			2
he added : ‘ we ’ve already got two classes of mps			0
since the devolution settlement was first introduced 15 years ago , we ’ve had @entity3 mps who have been able to vote on laws relating to @entity6 when they ca n’t vote on the same matters relating to their own constituencies			1
so there is an unfairness there that already needed rectifying ; the case is even stronger as we transfer more power			0
’ mr @entity95 , leader of the @entity47 campaign for a proper @entity6 settlement , called for a @entity116 vote on the so - called @entity118 question before the next election			0
such a vote would put @entity72 mps who disagreed on the wrong side of public opinion			0
he said : ‘ if the other @entity6 mps in other parties vote us down they will have to explain why			2
’ a no 10 source played down the idea , saying it was ‘ not ruled out ’ but depended on what a @entity131 committee chaired by @entity132 proposed			0
sir @entity134 , the @entity135 , considered modest restrictions to the role of @entity3 mps in a report for the government last year			2
he said more powers for @entity3 would mean going further , and suggested that laws only affecting @entity6 should be passed via a double majority voting system , gaining the support of a majority of @entity6 mps as well as a majority of the @entity116 as a whole .			1
