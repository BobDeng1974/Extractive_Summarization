just when a girl has her high - heel sashay perfected , along comes an escalator			1
moments earlier this young lady had been click - clacking confidently along in her stilettos			0
but all it took was one step on the escalator for her day to go seriously downhill – or make that uphill			1
somehow her heel became caught on a step and although she battled gamely to free herself , she eventually toppled backwards and was carried in a rather undignified fashion all the way to the top			1
more than 3,000 people slipped , tripped or fell at railway stations in the past 12 months			1
luggage is often a culprit , with incidents involving people lugging suitcases and bags up by 70 per cent in seven years			2
the woman ’s fall from grace happened back in april			2
but rail bosses believe such slip - ups can be a seasonal hazard at christmas time , when commuters are often travelling home from parties			0
helped by a gallant passer - by when she got to the top , the woman was none the worse for her ordeal by escalator			1
@entity68 , from @entity27 , said : ‘ a combination of more people carrying @entity45 shopping , trailing wheelie suitcases , wet and windy weather and people travelling late after festive parties make december a time where we see more people take a tumble			1
‘ please plan ahead so that you do n’t end up rushing to catch your train – falling over could be a miserable end to an enjoyable evening			2
’ another clip in the video , filmed at @entity90 station in @entity91 and named ‘ the mad dash and crash ' , sees and a woman fall head - first into the platform as she is running to catch her train			2
the third video , also filmed at @entity90 and called ' the pole dance crunch ' , features two women in party dresses twirl around a pole before falling face first and sprawling onto the platform			0

having fun : in another video at @entity90 called ' the pole dance crunch ' , two women in dresses twirl around a pole collapsed : but before long they are both on the ground after falling face first and sprawling onto the platform ' it ’s always important to remain aware of your surroundings , particularly at this time of year when more of us are out shopping and partying ' assistant chief constable @entity146 , @entity147 last december saw 322 incidents , accounting for 10 per cent of the total , and fridays were the most common day for a slip , trip or fall to occur - with more than a third between 5pm and 2.30am			1
assistant chief constable @entity146 of @entity147 said : ’ it ’s always important to remain aware of your surroundings , particularly at this time of year when more of us are out shopping and partying			0
