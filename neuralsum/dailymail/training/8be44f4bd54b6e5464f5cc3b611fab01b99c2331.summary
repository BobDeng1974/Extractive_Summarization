by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor president @entity2 has n't kept his health - care promises , but at least his navigators were taught to be more honest -- even if some of them ignored that advice two documents released monday about the @entity9 ' could n't be more different : a congressional report slammed the health insurance helpers for encouraging fraud , while the organization 's own training manual encouraged workers to ' be candid , open , and honest ' and ' build trust ' with @entity1 seeking health care policies			1
the @entity18 released its scathing indictment of the navigator program in conjunction with a @entity23 field hearing			0
investigators found that volunteers tasked with enrolling @entity27 customers were encouraging applicants to lie in order to get government subsidies and favorable premiums			1
' navigators from the @entity34 of @entity35 were captured on video , ' committee chairman rep. @entity32 reported , ' encouraging applicants to lie on their health insurance application so the applicants could qualify for tax subsidies			1
' ' navigators were also recorded advising an applicant to lie about her smoking habits to obtain a lower monthly premium , ' the report added			1
in addition to advice reminiscent of @entity50 's ' do n't be evil ' rule , the navigator training manual , provided a stark contrast with the @entity2 administration 's performance since healthcare.gov 's oct. 1 rollout			1
' only offer consumers something that you are sure you can give them , ' the manual insists			0
' do n’t promise timelines you are not sure you can fulfill			0
stick to deadlines ... and never make promises you can not keep			2
if situations change , let consumers know as soon as possible			0
and the @entity90 has missed or postponed more than a dozen deadlines in the @entity27 's implementation			2
the training manual was surfaced by the conservative @entity94 , and is hosted online by @entity95 , a project of the @entity97 and the @entity98			1
it carries the government 's ' restricted distribution ' classification ; each page bears the warning ' information not releasable to the @entity105			0
' the oversight committee 's report also blasted local navigator groups for collecting and mailing paper @entity27 applications – a violation of federal privacy regulations – and for falsely telling consumers that their credit scores could affect their eligibility for new health insurance plans			1
like millions of @entity1 , navigator groups were caught off guard when healthcare.gov failed to launch as planned			1
they lacked a contingency plan for the online flop , congressional investigators found			1
' our system is temporarily down ' : @entity90 secretary @entity124 held a @entity126 photo - op in november but no one could reach @entity74 despite the president 's repeated urging during the chronically ill website 's early weeks that @entity1 could still enroll in @entity27 on paper or via telephone calls , those methods also required someone to have access to the website			2
@entity18 @entity69 still have their knives out over @entity27 , this time going after the ' navigator ' volunteers tasked with signing people up navigators were in the same boat , it turned out , unable to help people on the phone , or in person either with a laptop or a pen and paper			2
' @entity151 ' meeting notes from the healthcare.gov team 's first month in action ' show confused @entity90 officials struggling to advise navigators about how to respond to the inoperable website , ' @entity32 's committee wrote			0
notes from october 11 , 2013 stated that ' [ t ] he paper applications allow people to feel like they are moving forward in the process and provides another option ; at the end of the day , we are all stuck in the same queue			0
' that dysfunction was on full display nov. 19 during a @entity167 visit by hhs secretary @entity124			0
while reporters trailed her during a chat with @entity42 at a @entity172 hospital , one noticed that the site was crashing			0
' the screen says , " i ’m sorry but the system is temporarily down , " ' a television reporter told @entity124 , who could only mutter a surprised , ' uh oh			0

house committee reports that some @entity42 were advising consumers to lie about their income in order to qualify for subsidies
other volunteer health care helpers told @entity1 to deny their smoking habits so their rates would go down
navigator groups had no contingency plan for dealing with the failed launch of healthcare.gov , leaving them unable to help their own customers
a secret training manual for @entity42 is *soaked* in @entity27 irony , advising helpers to keep their promises and stick to their deadlines
