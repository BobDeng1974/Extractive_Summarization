by @entity1 reporter published : 10:06 est , 22 june 2013 updated : 15:49 est , 22 june 2013 it could take years to extradite @entity4 whistleblower @entity3 from @entity5 to the @entity6 on charges of espionage and according to legal experts , the move would likely be blocked by @entity11			1
on friday , the @entity6 has charged @entity3 with theft of government property , unauthorized communication of national defense information and willful communication of classified communications intelligence to an unauthorized person			1
the latter two charges are part of the @entity6 @entity21			1
all three crimes carry a maximum 10 - year prison penalty			0
@entity4 whistleblower @entity3 has been charged with espionage and theft and @entity6 officials are seeking his extradition from @entity5 @entity5 legislators responded by calling for mainland @entity11 to intervene in the case			1
@entity3 , 29 , who is apparently hiding in @entity5 , was last seen on 10th june			1
the @entity6 and @entity5 have had an extradition treaty in place since 1998 , the year after @entity5 was transferred from @entity32 to @entity11 rule			1
while espionage and theft of state secrets are not cited specifically in the treaty , charged could be brought against @entity3 under @entity5 's official secrets ordinance			1
many @entity6 have been sent back for trial under the treaty but such extraditions can often take between three to five years			1
however , it would also require the @entity5 authorities to charge @entity3 with a similar crime otherwise the extradition process could not begin and @entity3 would theoretically be free to leave the city			1
under @entity5 's extradition system , a request first goes through diplomatic channels to the government , who decides whether to issue an ' authority to proceed '			1
if granted , a magistrate would issue a formal warrant for the arrest of @entity3			1
once brought before the court , the judge would decide whether there was sufficient evidence to commit @entity3 to trial or dismiss the case , though any decision could be appealed in a higher court			1
@entity3 could claim political asylum in @entity5 , arguing he would face torture back home			1
in general , the extradition agreement between the @entity6 and @entity5 excepts political offenses from the obligation to turn over a person			1
sen. @entity70 , @entity71 , a member of the @entity72 , welcomed the charges			0
' i 've always thought this was a treasonous act , ' he said in a statement			0
' i hope @entity5 's government will take him into custody and extradite him to the @entity6 ' the unfairness of his trial at home and his likely treatment in custody woudl be factors to consider when assessing @entity3 's chances of claiming political immunity from extradition			1
even if a @entity5 court decided that @entity3 should be extradited , @entity5 's leader and @entity11 could still veto the decision on national security or defense grounds			1
@entity3 has admitted leaking secrets about classified @entity6 surveillance programmes , which he said he did in the public interest			1
supporters say he is a whistleblower , while critics call him a criminal and perhaps even a traitor			0
@entity3 , has admitted providing information to the news media about two highly classified @entity4 surveillance programs			2
a one - page criminal complaint unsealed friday in federal court in @entity106 , @entity107 , says @entity3 engaged in unauthorized communication of national defense information and willful communication of classified communications intelligence information			1
helping hand : @entity114 spokesman @entity113 , left , approached @entity115 on behalf of @entity3 and his middleman			2
@entity117 , right , also sought help from @entity115 ahead of @entity114 ' releases @entity115 has a reputation for promoting internet freedoms and has long been discussed as an option for @entity3			2
as a @entity6 citizen , @entity3 would not need a visa to enter @entity115 and could immediately apply for asylum			1
he would be free to live in @entity115 while immigration authorities decide his case , which could take more than a year , experts have said			0
but if @entity3 wants to seek refuge in @entity115 , he 'll have to get there first			2
and this is where the @entity6 could have a chance			2
@entity134 will sometimes issue a ' red notice ' - which is like an international arrest warrant - but keep it sealed so that the person does n't know it exists			0
if he tried to travel , he would be arrested at the airport			0
if he did get to @entity115 , it is unknown if he would be safe			0
the government of newly - elected prime minister @entity143 is believed to be closer to @entity144 than past administrations and less keen to foster the country 's cyber-haven image			0
' i would be very surprised if they ( the government ) would be eager to engage in any international disputes with the @entity6 and it is pretty difficult to be granted asylum here , ' @entity148 , lecturer in political science at the @entity150 , told @entity156			2
' i think what this guy is saying is based on something he is imagining or hoping for rather than actual facts			0
' @entity115 does have an extradition treaty with the @entity6 , but it is unclear if it would cover any crimes that he might be charged with			1
@entity165 , a retired 30 - year veteran with the @entity166 who served from 1990 to 1994 as the legal liaison officer at the @entity6 consulate in @entity5 , said ' relations between @entity6 and @entity5 law enforcement personnel are historically quite good			1
' ' in my time , i felt the degree of cooperation was outstanding to the extent that i almost felt i was in an @entity166 field office , ' said @entity165			0
the @entity6 and @entity5 cooperate on law enforcement matters and have a standing agreement on the surrender of fugitives			1
however , @entity3 's appeal rights could drag out any extradition proceeding			2
the success or failure of any extradition proceeding depends on what the suspect is charged with under @entity6 law and how it corresponds to @entity5 law under the treaty			1
in order for @entity5 officials to honor the extradition request , they have to have some applicable statute under their law that corresponds with a violation of @entity6 law			1
news of the charges broke on friday evening , the same day it emerged that @entity3 could be flown to @entity115 from @entity5 by the whistleblowing website @entity114			1
a businessman connected to the controversial website said a chartered private jet is ready for the 30 - year - old , who fled to @entity5 after leaking @entity6 security details			1
it comes after @entity115 admitted holding talks with @entity3 over the possibility of seeking political asylum			2
@entity211 , head of @entity213 , which handles donations to @entity114 , revealed details of the private jet			0
speaking to @entity217 television , he said : ' everything is ready on our side and the plane could take off tomorrow			0
' we have really done all we can do			0
we have a plane and all the logistics in place			0
' the jet is believed to belong to a @entity11 firm and has been chartered at a cost of $ 240,000			2
@entity114 founder @entity117 revealed on wednesday he had been in contact with @entity3 's representatives to discuss his possible bid for asylum in @entity115			2
the former @entity6 government contractor fled to @entity5 on may 20 after leaking @entity4 programs			1
it also emerged that a contractor for the @entity4 found possible discrepancies in a resume submitted by @entity3 , but the company still employed him , a source said on thursday			2
@entity3 was hired this spring after he convinced his hiring screeners at @entity240 , that his description of his education was truthful			2
it is unclear precisely which element of @entity3 's resume caused personnel officials at @entity240 to raise questions about his background			2
also unclear is how he satisfied their concerns			0
@entity240 has said in a statement that ' we will work closely with our clients and authorities in their investigation of this matter			0
' @entity3 fled his home in @entity258 , where he worked for @entity4 contractor @entity240 , after exposing the @entity6 government 's top surveillance secrets			1
he is at a secret location in @entity5			0
in a column in @entity115 daily newspaper @entity263 , @entity114 spokesman @entity113 wrote that a middleman had approached him on behalf of @entity3			0
' on 2 june , i received a message from @entity3 where he asked me to notify the @entity115 government that he wanted to seek asylum in @entity115 , ' @entity113 , who is also an investigative journalist in @entity115 , told @entity156			2
support : @entity3 's image is displayed in @entity5 , where the whistleblower is currently in hiding he added that he has yet to receive a response from officials about his request but said they have a ' moral obligation ' to answer the call for help			1
the @entity115 government , which has refused to say whether they would grant asylum to @entity3 , confirmed it had received the message from @entity113			2
' @entity113 has contacted two ministries in an informal way but not the ministers , ' a government spokesman said			0
' there has been no formal approach in this matter			0
' @entity113 would not identify who the middleman was			0
@entity3 has previously mentioned @entity115 as a possible refuge			0
@entity115 has a reputation for promoting @entity295 freedoms , but @entity3 has said did not travel there immediately from the @entity6 as he feared the country could be pressured by @entity144			1
' @entity115 could be pushed harder , quicker , before the public could have a chance to make their feelings known , and i would not put that past the current @entity6 administration , ' @entity3 said in an online forum in the @entity304 on monday			1
it had been suggested that he would actually flee to the @entity115 consulate in @entity5 , rather than risking boarding a plane to fly there in person			0
safety : @entity115 has a reputation for promoting internet freedoms			0
@entity311 is pictured @entity115 officials told @entity313 last week that @entity3 is missing a key element			0
' the main stipulation for seeking asylum in @entity115 would be that the person must be in @entity115 to start the process , ' said @entity319 , the chief spokesman for @entity115 's @entity320 in @entity311			0
' that would be the ground rule no. 1			0
' @entity114 founder @entity117 , who is holed up in the @entity324 embassy in @entity325 to avoid extradition to @entity327 for questioning over allegations of sex crimes , visited @entity115 several times in the run - up to some of the website 's major releases			0
yet some experts added that @entity115 might not be as welcoming as @entity3 hopes			0
the government of newly - elected prime minister @entity143 has not been tested in relation to these cases , but is believed to be closer to @entity144 than past administrations and less keen to foster the country 's cyber-haven image			0
' i would be very surprised if they ( the government ) would be eager to engage in any international disputes with the @entity6 and it is pretty difficult to be granted asylum here , ' @entity148 , lecturer in political science at the @entity150 , told @entity156			2
