it is not unusual for people to have rituals when flying on a plane , like wearing a @entity5 chain or keeping their eyes closed until they take off			1
but one passenger took his beliefs a step further by covering himself in a plastic bag for the whole of his journey because his religion forbids him to fly over cemeteries			1
this was the bizarre sight that greeted plane passengers when an @entity20 man covered himself under a plastic sheet			1
it was believed the man is a @entity24 , a religious descendant of the priests of ancient @entity26 , who are banned from flying over cemeteries			1
sight to see : this photo of a man who appears to be an @entity30 shows him seated aboard a plane while wrapped in a plastic bag , drawing controversy and question on what for @entity24 ( plural of @entity24 ) are the male - line descendants of the priests of ancient @entity26			1
descendants are shunned from flying over cemeteries and being in contact with the dead			2
contact with the dead is believed to inflict him with impurity			0
why a plastic bag ? some consider that the bag provides a potential barrier from the impurities / dead how can they breathe ? pre-punched holes invalidate the barrier if the kohein is putting on the bag and it accidentally rips some leniency to breathe is provided contact with the dead would consequently inflict him with impurity			1
problems : flights have been delayed or turned around because of the ensuing safety hazards the passengers would not be able to reach an oxygen mask or quickly escape the plane in the event of an emergency many wrap themselves in plastic bags as a compromise measure			2
the startling photograph , which has now gone viral after being posted on @entity69 , shows fellow passengers straining over their seats to get a look			1
beneath his plastic wrapping , the man is dressed entirely in black , and appears to be wearing a @entity76 skullcap or ' kippah '			2
as a controversial solution - not entirely allowed by those in the @entity20 - the plastic bag creates a kind of barrier between the @entity24 and the surrounding tumah , or impurity			1
rabbi @entity85 , of @entity86 in @entity26 , explained : ' in orthodox and conservative communities , @entity24 are expected to abstain from coming in contact with the dead , which includes a prohibition on visiting cemeteries except for the funerals of close relatives			1
' even if they can be secured by a seat belt , the passengers would n't be able to reach an oxygen mask or quickly escape the plane in the event of an emergency			2
there is also the question of how they can breathe			0
pre-punched holes in the plastic are said to invalidate the barrier , according to @entity76 newspaper @entity106			0
way around it ? @entity26 's @entity110 airport is surrounded by small regional cemeteries , dotted in red , creating long concern for @entity20 trying to fly into the airport ' only if when the kohein is putting on this bag it accidentally rips can there be some leniency , ' the article claims			1
' @entity24 have a duty to protect their taharah , purity , ' according to the article			0
' they have been bestowed with extra kedushah which makes them worth of being @entity126			0
at times , there may be extra demands made upon them in order to maintain that standard of kedushah and taharah			0
' some flights go to great lengths to take specific paths to avoid cemeteries			0
and passengers can also be made aware in advance if a body will be aboard the plane in cargo			0
the photograph , which was posted on the @entity69 yesterday , had a caption which read : ' an @entity30 in an airplane with women - so he covers himself with a plastic bag ... ' a strict code of conduct prevents @entity20 men and women from mixing in public , with @entity26 airline @entity153 seeing an increase in the number of religious men demanding to be reseated away from women in recent years			1
the @entity20 passenger who wore a plastic bag is thought to have travelled from @entity162 , @entity26 with the airline while @entity164 do follow to strict guidelines which include gender segregation in public , it is claimed this photograph does not show that			1
one user of the @entity69 site wrote : ' this has nothing to do with women			0
he is a cohen , descendant from the high holy priests of the temple and they are not allowed to walk into or fly over a cemetery , which would render them impure			0
' it is not known when the photograph was taken , or what airline the man was travelling on , but it is more than likely it was an @entity153 aircraft flying out of @entity162 , which is surrounded by a number of cemetries , according to internet users			0
in 2001 , @entity153 decided not to allow @entity164 cover themselves in plastic because ' flight safety considerations do not allow for passengers to board while covered in sealed plastic bags			2
' a year later it was reported that flight crew got into an argument with a passenger who attempted to fly wrapped in plastic			2
the confrontation eventually led the pilot to turn the plane around			0
one woman even sued the airline after staff moved her to the back of a plane when an @entity164 man refused to sit next to her .			0
