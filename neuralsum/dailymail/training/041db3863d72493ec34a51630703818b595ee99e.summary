the @entity0 are often accused of being grumpy and dismissive			1
but @entity2 and @entity3 are also hardwired to be miserable , scientists claim			2
despite stable governments and good economies , those living in the @entity2 and @entity3 will never be as happy as people in other nations , because they are simply born more miserable			2
they are genetically programmed to be less cheerful than the @entity9 , for example , who top the list of the happiest nation			2
@entity3 and @entity2 ( such as the famously grumpy @entity3 actor @entity14 , left , and @entity2 tennis star @entity15 , right ) are actually hardwired to be miserable , new research claims scientists found that @entity0 people ( such as actress @entity19 ) have one of the shortest forms of the gene , which may explain their reputation for being miserable and scientists at the @entity26 discovered it all comes down to a gene which regulates levels of the hormone serotonin in the brain			1
short forms of the gene inhibit levels of the hormone , which can invoke depression			2
meanwhile those with longer forms of the gene are more likely to be happier , as a result of higher levels of serotonin in the body			1
researchers discovered people from @entity9 have the longest form of the gene , and as such topped the happiness chart			1
but professor @entity47 said it could be worse , we could be @entity0 - the nation with one of the shortest forms of the gene , which may explain their reputation for being grumpy			1
the researchers , from the the @entity26 , discovered it all comes down to a gene which regulates levels of the hormone serotonin in the brain			1
short forms of the gene inhibit levels of the hormone , which can invoke depression			2
meanwhile those with longer forms of the gene are more likely to be happier , as a result of higher levels of serotonin in the body			1
researchers discovered people from @entity9 have the longest form of the gene , and as such , topped the happiness chart			1
annual tables of national happiness ratings , compiled by organisations across the world , tend to rank @entity9 at the top , along with nations including @entity72 and @entity73			2
they use factors ranging from job satisfaction to economic progress , health , wealth and education standards , along with weather , war and political stability to judge nations			0
@entity85 do well as their health is good , they are educated to a high standard and they earn more			0
but warm weather countries can do well too			0
some wealthy @entity90 countries fare less well because there are big divides between rich and poor or they have high unemployment rates or less job satisfaction for instance			0
but according to @entity98 , many of these may still be miserable even if they are earning a fortune , basking in sunshine and living to 100			0
his findings from 131 countries for the @entity104 , found genetics to be the most important factor but not the only one			0
the study found people living in @entity9 had the longest form of the gene , and as a result were found to be among the happiest nations in the world grumpy : @entity3 - born @entity114 is usually seen scowling when she is photographed , and once admitted she is a ' miserable ' person in real life those who are either young or old tend to be happiest rather than those who are middle aged			1
those who are slim are happiest , with obesity levels in some developed countries making them less happy as nations			0
and being married , in a job and well educated can also be a contributory factor			0
professor @entity47 , said : ' intriguingly , among the nations we studied , @entity9 and the @entity124 appeared to have the lowest percentage of people with the short version of the serotonin gene			1
' he added that many individual @entity3 were happy but they tended to be descended from immigrants who came from countries like @entity9 in the first place			0
he said : ' there was a direct correlation between the ( @entity3 ) individual 's reported happiness , and the levels of happiness in the country their ancestors had come from			0
' our study revealed an unexplained correlation between the happiness today of some nations and the observed happiness of @entity3 whose ancestors came from these nations			0

scientists at @entity26 discovered the gene **responsible** for serotonin levels in the brain is **responsible** for setting your mood
the shorter the gene , the lower the levels of the mood - *enhancing* hormone
longer the gene the higher the levels of serotonin , thus people are happier
@entity9 found to be happiest , and have longest form of the gene
but those in @entity0 are most miserable , with the shortest form
