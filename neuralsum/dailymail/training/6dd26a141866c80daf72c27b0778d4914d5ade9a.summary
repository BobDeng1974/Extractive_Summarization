in a controversial response to recent scandals over multi-tasking executives , @entity1 said employees should moonlight for other organisations to ‘ find out about life outside ’			2
but as it emerged @entity1 has 11 outside positions on top of his £ 450,000 @entity2 role , critics accused him of failing to crack down on managers who earn lucrative second salaries			1
quizzing him before the culture , media and sport committee , @entity23 mp @entity22 said it was ‘ extraordinary ’ that senior managers were allowed to top up their salaries by working extra hours			1
others accused him of failing to exert the ‘ firm hand of governance ’ by cracking down on the problem			0
earlier this year it emerged the @entity2 ’s former technology chief @entity34 held down a £ 28,000 outside role while he was presiding over the failed £ 100million @entity36 , prompting accusations he had failed to concentrate on his day job			1
and last month , business controller @entity39 was found to be supplementing her £ 207,000 @entity2 income with a second job running her own café business			1
she kept a regular blog about the stresses of fitting calls around ‘ proper job meetings ’ and left work at 4.40pm to get back to the café in time			0
@entity1 agreed her blog was ‘ daft ’ , but refused to condemn her for juggling multiple roles			0
he said : ‘ my position on this is i think it is good for people in the @entity2 to get involved in things outside the @entity2 , especially if it is for charity			1
' i obviously do charitable contributions myself			0
it is important to have a perspective of what life is like outside			0
’ @entity68 mp @entity67 said @entity1 should have ‘ struck a much firmer tone ’ on the issue , adding : ‘ if you are being paid a quarter of a million pounds by the @entity2 you should be expected to work full time for the @entity2 , as in any other organisation			1
’ moonlighting : @entity1 was accused of failing to crack down on senior @entity2 managers who earn lucrative second salaries but @entity1 replied : ‘ no i have n’t [ struck a firmer tone ] , for the reason i said			1
as i was careful to say it depends on the person , it depends on the job			0
' i think people can learn a lot by being a non-exec on a charity or some other organisation which you then bring back into the @entity2			0
' i think that kind of fluidity and porousness between the @entity2 and other organisations is actually a very good thing			2
’ pressed on miss @entity39 ’s case after the hearing , he said : ‘ it was all done in her own time , and the manager concerned is absolutely certain she is concentrating on the day job , which is all i ask of somebody			0
’ mr @entity22 , who chairs the committee , said : ‘ nobody is saying you should n’t get involved in charities , but it is completely different when you have a highly remunerated job on top of your main role			2
' if you are a member of senior management , you should n’t be earning extra money by taking on extra work outside the @entity2			2
