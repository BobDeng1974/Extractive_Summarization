a young woman left paralysed after an accident at work said a boob job gave her the confidence and motivation to learn to walk again			1
@entity6 , 26 , from @entity7 in the @entity8 was distraught when she was left partially paralysed after a lifting injury at work			1
the lack of feeling in her lower body meant she was forced to wear a colostomy bag , which ruined her confidence			1
she decided to undergo a breast enhancement operation to improve her self - esteem			0
@entity6 , 26 , from @entity7 , was left partially paralysed ( left ) and fitted with a colostomy bag after an accident at work			1
to improve her self - esteem and encourage her recovery she underwent breast enlargement surgery which gave her the confidence learn to walk again , and even go on holiday ( right ) her breasts went up five cup sizes , from @entity27 to @entity28 and she credits the operation in helping her recover			1
she said : ' i feel amazing now i 've got big boobs , i love them			0
' they look fantastic and have helped my recovery as i 'm full of confidence			0
' i was going through rehab before my boob job , and was slowly taking a few steps , but my boob job has really helped me to walk properly again			1
' i feel like a different person			0
' she added : ' my boob job has given me the lift i needed in order to continue with my recovery			1
' miss @entity6 , a healthcare support worker , became paralysed in march 2012 after lifting a patient at work damaged some of the discs in her spine			1
doctors are still unsure how this led to paralysis , but it was later found that she had degenerative discs in her spine , meaning she might have had a weaker back than usual			2
it is thought the fluid between discs in her spine had become thinner than usual in a woman of her age , causing pain and paralysis			0
the condition caused her to lose all feeling from the waist to the knee caps , and she has no sensation in her toes			2
as the nerves that control the bowel and bladder are located at the base of the spine , miss @entity6 lost the ability to go to the toilet			2
she needed a colostomy , an operation where a section of the bowel is diverted and attached to an opening in the wall of the abdomen , where waste can be collected into a drainage bag			2
she said : ' it was a really difficult time , but my confidence really hit rock bottom when i had to be fitted with a colostomy bag			1
before miss @entity6 's accident ( right ) she was healthy , but after hurting her back at work doctors discovered she might have degenerative discs in her spine ( left ) ' i knew the colostomy bag was the best decision as i just could n't feel anything , but it really affected my self - esteem			1
' miss @entity6 had been going to rehab in order to learn to walk again			2
but due to her slow progress she decided she needed something to lift her mood			0
so in july this year she decided a breast enlargement surgery would give her the motivation to keep working at her recovery			2
she said : ' i knew having a boob job would help boost my confidence , so i decided to go ahead			1
' i 'd always hated my @entity27 boobs anyway			2
' i did n't want small boobs for any longer and after a friend recommended a great surgery clinic to me , i booked in for a free consultation			0
' my new @entity28 boobs felt amazing , they 've changed my life			0
' before miss @entity6 's accident , she was an active and healthy woman who had never had any back problems			2
she said : ' before my accident at work i had been a completely normal and healthy			0
' i had no idea i had a weak back until lifting a patient damaged a few of my discs			1
' she added that her partner and family have supported her throughout her ordeal and she knows she could n't have got through the past year without them			0
she said : ' they fully supported my decision to undergo a boob job and they can see how it 's changed my life already			1
' for seven months i relied on carers to help me at home but finally after regaining my strength i 'm leading an independent life			0
' miss @entity6 underwent a breast enlargement operation increasing the size of her breasts from @entity27 to @entity28 at first doctors feared @entity138 may have meningitis or multiple sclerosis but tests failed to reach any diagnosis			1
with no clear conclusion , and after months of being bed - bound , she did n't know if she would ever walk again			0
but her breast enlargement gave her the motivation to work hard during physiotherapy , and eventually she was able to take her first few steps			1
she has since gone on holiday to show off her new body			2
miss @entity6 said : ' i had a few people staring and pointing at my colostomy bag when i was in my bikini but i am proud of it			1
' i no longer needed padding in my bikini tops and that filled me with such excitement			0
' she hopes one day the feeling in her lower body will return , but at the moment is focused on going to university			0
she said : ' i might need an operation in the future but i 'm not focusing on that yet			0
' i 'm started university this week and i 'm excited to get on with my life			0
' i can finally start looking forward to the future			0
