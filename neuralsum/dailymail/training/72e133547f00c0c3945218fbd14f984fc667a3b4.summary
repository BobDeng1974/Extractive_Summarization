residents at housing flats in @entity2 have criticised the building 's segregated entrances policy , where one doorway is set aside for the rich and the other for its housing association tenants			1
@entity2 mayor @entity8 recently faced calls to ban ‘ poor doors ’ in upmarket blocks of flats , which force people on low incomes to use different entrances			1
but developers in @entity2 are promising wealthy tenants they will not have to share their smart lobby entrances , courtyard gardens or secure parking with people living in flats classed as ‘ affordable housing ’			1
a resident named only as @entity40 told the @entity41 she and her family must enter the flats through the ' poor door ' - an entrance without the concierge or 24 hour service her wealthy neighbours enjoy around the corner			2
she said : ' i 've never felt poorer in my life because of the way we 're kept apart			0
' i do n't want my kids thinking they deserve to be treated differently			0
it 's humiliating and wrong			0
' the practice faces being banned in @entity57 after a backlash and has sparked a political row in the @entity60 with @entity61 condemning the covert ‘ segregation ’			2
the housing block in @entity36 where tenants are frustrated they are being segregated from wealthier neighbours the problem stems from rules which are supposed to stop areas becoming ghettos for the very rich			1
when planning permission is granted , developers are often told to set aside a set number of units for affordable housing			1
from the outside , there is often no way of telling the more basic homes from the hi - spec apartments aimed at the super-rich			0
but behind the façade , less well - off tenants are forced to enter through different doors and use separate bicycle racks , bins and post boxes			2
@entity61 ’s shadow housing minister @entity87 told @entity88 : ‘ i am strongly against this kind of segregation			0
there should n’t be separate doors for people living in affordable housing			1
‘ many of the developers that i have been to have n’t had this distinction but i am deeply concerned that it is something happening in the @entity60			0

developers , forced to set aside units for affordable housing , *create* separate entrances to avoid flat sale profits being *affected* by low income tenants
@entity36 block of flats has separate entrances for private and housing association tenants , sparking claims of new type of class segregation
comes as @entity2 mayor @entity8 recently faced calls to stop the use of ' poor doors ' in upmarket blocks of flats as @entity57 moves to ban them
