in a bain - marie or double boiler , melt the chocolate and butter together			1

next , separate the eggs , cream the caster sugar and egg yolks until they become thick and glossy			2
now , whisk the whites into soft peaks and set aside			2
you should now have five different bowls of ingredients : mix together the eggs and sugar with the chestnut puree , followed by the prunes and then the chocolate mixture			1
lightly whisk until well combined			2
@entity129 grate the zest of the orange into the mixture followed by the juice			1
to combine the egg whites , first put one big dollop of the whites into the mixture to loosen it			2
then gently fold in in the remaining whites until they are all combined			2
pour into the prepared tin and bake for 25 to 30 mins			2
it should be still slight wobbly in the middle and a few cracks will have appeared			0

once the cakes are half cooled and the torte has chilled , its time to stack them			0
first place one sponge on top of the torte and flip it over so the sponge is now on the bottom			0
the torte is quite delicate so this means there is less chance of it breaking up			0
now place the second sponge on top of the torte			0
the torte should now be in the filling of a sponge sandwich			0
for the ganache : the ganache is made with water and chocolate not cream			1
in a bain - marie or double boiler melt the chocolate			1
while the chocolate is melting boil 125ml of water			1
once melted take the bowl off the heat and pour in about a table spoon of the water in the chocolate , and whisk together			1
it will look like its separating but keep whisking – it will come together			0
then add the remaining water and keep whisking			0
the ganache will be a bit runny but will thicken up as it cools			0
while the ganache is still workable , cover the whole cake / torte in the ganache with a palette knife			1
for the meringue : in a saucepan , stir the sugar and water together over a medium heat			0
dip a pastry brush in water and brush any bits of sugar from the sides of the pan down into the syrup to melt , otherwise it will turn the sugar syrup grainy			0
when all of the sugar is dissolved , bring it to a fast boil until it reaches @entity230			0
while the syrup is reaching temperature , whisk the egg whites with the cream of tartar into soft peaks			0
as soon as the syrup reaches the correct temperature , pour it onto the egg whites in a thin , steady stream as you whisk			0
be careful not to pour the hot syrup directly onto the beaters , as it may stick to them or splash back at you			0
when all the syrup has been mixed , continue to whisk the meringue until it has cooled			0
it should be shiny and stiff and be tepid temperate			0
transfer to a piping bag and with a large nozzle pipe small peaks to the top of the cake , starting around the outside and work your way into the middle			1
dust your serving plate with cocoa and transfer the cake to the plate , finish the top of the cake with finely chopped candied chestnuts and flaked almonds			1
the cake will keep for three days in the fridge so can be made in advance .			2
