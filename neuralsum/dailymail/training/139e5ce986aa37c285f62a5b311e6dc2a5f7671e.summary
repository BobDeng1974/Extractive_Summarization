by @entity0 published : 18:40 est , 26 may 2013 updated : 18:40 est , 26 may 2013 now if you 're going to get sick , please can you try to plan it well in advance , preferably before 5pm , monday to friday ? in the modern @entity4 getting to see our local gp at a time when it suits us rather than them has become a pipe - dream , like finding a parking space you do n't have to pay for by mobile phone , or bagging a trolley at the supermarket when you have n't got a pound coin			1
@entity19 departments are in meltdown , swamped with an extra million people a year ( compared with three years ago )			1
they ca n't see their local doctor since new contracts in 2004 gave them a 45 per cent pay increase and allowed @entity27 to opt out of working unsocial hours			1
@entity0 , left , says : ' the @entity28 reckons that 93 per cent of doctor 's surgeries in @entity31 are not open when it is convenient for patients - but what have they done about it ? nothing ' worse , after sitting patiently in a queue in casualty for hours in the evening or weekend , there 's a one in five chance the person who sees you will be a junior doctor with just a few months ' experience			1
many have not been long in the @entity45 , are on short - term contracts , have limited @entity31 , and certainly no knowledge of any of your family history			2
many consultants and senior doctors , like @entity27 , do n't work at night			1
millions of us have lost faith in out - of - hours helplines , run by private companies who use nurses instead of doctors , and would rather take pot luck at hospital instead			2
the @entity28 reckons that 93 per cent of doctor 's surgeries in @entity31 are not open when it is convenient for patients - but what have they done about it ? nothing			1
the @entity68 says emergency wards ca n't cope			1
the body which represents @entity19 doctors agrees			2
health secretary @entity72 blames gps			1
but even when you are lucky enough get to see your family doctor , in the over-stretched , reconfigured cost - efficient @entity4 , it 's a dispiriting experience			1
first , they hardly look at you , and stare at their computer screen			2
they spend your precious few minutes of face - to - face time typing in information and reading stuff online			2
when you have blood tests you have to ring up a couple of days later and speak to the over-worked receptionist , who will tell you if the results are normal or not			2
that 's a medically unqualified secretary who has a line of patients waiting for appointments and prescriptions standing right in front of her			2
if you require a follow - up appointment , then you will have to go through the ridiculous procedure of bagging a convenient slot all over again			1
recently , my arthritis medication was altered , and the new drug requires blood tests for three months , but i was told they could n't be put in my diary now as the surgery does n't work that far in advance ! when i asked for a printout of my last blood tests , i was told i could n't obtain them online as so many were done every day			1
i have been given a password to log in and order repeat prescriptions , but i ca n't communicate directly with my doctor online about changing anything			1
this is half - baked : either you use the internet properly as a service to patients , or not			2
a friend was worried that the whites of her eyes looked slightly yellow , which could mean - although she felt ok - she was suffering from a serious liver complaint , or hepatitis			2
she waited days for her appointment , and then was disgusted when the gp ( whom she 'd never seen before ) looked up ‘ yellow eyes ' on @entity130 in front of her ! recently , @entity133 , head of the @entity134 , told a committee of @entity136 that he thought patients should email their doctors with their symptoms to free up surgery time			2
@entity142 mp @entity141 said : ‘ i thought medicine was based on observation			0
' in fact , would n't doctors ' surgeries run better if we just googled our own symptoms and sent an email to the gp for a second opinion ? ( only joking )			1
another sign that patients are regarded as stumbling blocks to efficiency is a controversial policy document on the @entity158 website , an organisation chaired by @entity160 and backed by party co-chairman @entity161 , which asks party activists to vote on various proposals to make the @entity4 more ' efficient '			1
to my horror , they ask if it 's a good or bad idea to limit the number of visits we can make to gps in a year , and whether appointments at weekends and evenings are ‘ a luxury the country can not afford '			1
another gem asks whether ‘ families should take care of their infirm relatives '			1
this website plays an important part in determining the @entity184 manifesto - so you have been warned			0
it 's perfectly plain that the @entity4 of the future would run so much better without us , the annoying patients who clog up doctors ' surgeries and @entity192			1
family doctors provide a service we pay for - increasingly , it 's one that suits them , rather than their customers			0
@entity196 , it 's @entity197 @entity198 says she wants to act bushy browed model of the moment @entity198 turns up in @entity201 ( above ) and announces , ' i want to act ' - telling journalists she 'd be happy to work with @entity204 , @entity205 , @entity206 or @entity207			0
the joyous arrogance of a 20 - year - old ! i ca n't say i was any different , because when you are that age you ca n't see why you wo n't be able to achieve whatever you want in life			1
@entity197 says she 'd like to play ' a @entity212 '			0
i presume she means the medieval @entity214 poet , whose @entity215 - a journey from @entity217 to @entity218 and @entity219 - has inspired artists and ( more recently ) a blockbuster by @entity222			0
@entity222 's latest opus , @entity224 , has been described as ' bilge ' and ' his worse book yet ' , but it will still sell in its millions			0
i wonder which stage of the journey interests @entity197			0
the fashion business might be @entity217 , and staying that thin @entity218 - but is she ready to face @entity229 in @entity219 ? having happening eyebrows does n't necessarily mean you 've got any acting ability			1
@entity233 , one of the most talented young actresses in the world , has a uniquely mobile face that changes depending on her character			0
sadly , no matter what faces she pulls on @entity240 snaps , @entity197 always looks exactly the same			0
ca n't we bank on the co-op anymore ? what 's going wrong at the once - reliable co-op ? the head of finance has been forced to resign after the banking arm of the group dramatically halted plans to buy 632 branches of @entity251 last month			1
the government was keen on the sale because it wants to break the dominance of the four major lenders in the @entity256			0
to add to their woes , the co-op 's banking boss left two weeks after a major credit agency slashed the company 's credit rating , causing customers to panic			0
@entity264 , the group finance director who has just resigned , had no experience in banking , but had been promoted from the food division			0
is the co-op trying to do too much ? my local branch in @entity271 , @entity272 , recently moved into a brand new building			0
it 's bigger than their old place , but seems to sell less			0
the other day they ran out of potatoes			0
there were hardly any vegetables and little fruit			0
i was told ‘ there has n't been a delivery ' - everything comes from a depot			1
the co-op supports @entity287 , but do they source local suppliers ? will mrs @entity289 give him a little ticking off ? @entity292 and @entity293 @entity292 has not visited the @entity294 since fleeing the country in 1978 after being arrested and charged with having sex with a 13 - year - old girl			0
the film director has mostly been based in @entity299 , avoiding countries which might extradite him			0
like many outside the rarefied world of luvvies , i find his failure to confront his past repellent , so why do his inane views about women get so much publicity ? promoting his latest film in @entity201 , which stars his beautiful wife @entity293 ( both pictured ) , @entity289 announced that the availability of the @entity314 had ‘ masculinised ’ women , and he regretted sexual equality , saying : ‘ trying to level the genders is purely idiotic			0
’ @entity293 is 33 years younger than @entity289 , and they have two children			0
wisely , she kept her mouth shut during her husband ’s comments , but i hope that , back home , she might have enlightened her @entity325 husband .			0

the @entity4 should be renamed care @entity6 , saturday or sundays
@entity28 says 93 *%* of gps are n't open at convenient times
