by @entity0 published : 09:26 est , 17 december 2012 updated : 12:03 est , 17 december 2012 scientists studying data from the the @entity3 who this summer announced the possible discovery of the @entity6 now say they may have found two previously uknown particles			1
the most recent release from the @entity10 experiment at the @entity11 ( @entity11 ) shows that their data contains two clear peaks indicating new particles			1
according to that model of our world , the @entity6 particle must exist to bestow mass on other fundamental particles			1
however , until it was possible to build high - powered colliders like the @entity3 it has been impossible to detect			0
researchers at @entity11 in july announced that they believed their experiments had finally revealed the @entity6			1
but as @entity43 explains , their findings were far from definite			0
the @entity6 they found appeared to show that the @entity6 seemed to be decaying into two photons more often than they had expected - hinting at a new , as yet unimagined physics			1
last week scientists with the project 's @entity10 experiment finally admitted that the bizarre revelations from their data - that there appears to be not one @entity55 's boson signal , but two			0
. there seems to be one version of @entity6 with a mass of 123.5 gigaelectron volts ( the unit particle physicists prefer using to measure mass ) and a second @entity6 with a mass of 126.6 gev			2
a graphical representation of particles smashing into each other in the @entity3 : it had been hoped the findings would finally prove the @entity28 of physics the higgs boson was proposed in 1964 - it is the last missing piece of the @entity28 , the theory that describes the basic building blocks of the universe			1
the other 11 particles predicted by the model have been found - the @entity6 is the last jigsaw piece			2
if the particle was shown not to exist , it would have meant tearing up the @entity28 and going back to the drawing board			0
and if there are in fact more than one @entity6 particles , as the latest results seem to show , it could lead to a new understanding of dark matter , the mysterious substance thought to make up a large portion of the mass of the universe			1
@entity43 reports how the @entity10 team have spent the past month trying to find out whether they had made a mistake in their analysis			0
they have so far found none , raising the possibility that there may indeed be two @entity6 bosons			2
the anomalous result could of course still have been caused be a statistical blip that is not repeated as further data is collected , but their are certain versions of the @entity28 that predict the existence of multiple @entity6 particles			1
however these theories do not predict why one kind would decay into two z particles , while the other decays into photons			0
furthermore the similarity in mass of the two particles is something that even the variants of the @entity28 are not able to explain			2
for the moment , the scientists at @entity11 are not too concerned			0
@entity113 , an experimental particle physicist on the projects @entity117 experiment says it is likely to turn out to be a blip			0
he blogs : ' this is normal business - if we had to get excited at every slight disagreement between our measurements and our expectations , we 'd be sick with @entity125 ( sorry ladies for this gender - specific pun )			0

latest release from @entity11 indicates that scientists have found two particles *contending* for the title of @entity6
one has slightly more mass than the other , and each decays into different kinds of particles
findings could *challenge* the @entity28 of physics , but researchers say they may merely be a statistical blip
