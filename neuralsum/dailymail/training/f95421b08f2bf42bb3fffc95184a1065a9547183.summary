by @entity0 published : 10:02 est , 10 october 2012 updated : 05:33 est , 11 october 2012 scores of civilians , many of them women with screaming children clinging to their necks , crossed a narrow river marking the border with @entity7 as shelling on a @entity9 town intensified yesterday			1
the @entity10 has responded to the escalating violence between @entity9 and @entity7 by sending a 150 strong specialist task force to its ally @entity14 , after concerns that the violence might spread across the southern border as well as in the north			1
the news comes after the @entity20 reported that 335,000 @entity9 refugees have registered with the organisation , an increase by ten times since march			1
@entity9 refugees : an injured man is carried to an ambulance after crossing the @entity29 river on the @entity7 - @entity9 border near the village of @entity32 in @entity33 province it came as @entity7 scrambled fighter planes to force a @entity9 passenger jet to land and seized what it suspected was military equipment being ferried from @entity39 to @entity9 president @entity41 's forces			1
the interception of the @entity9 air plane late yesterday happened soon after @entity7 's chief of staff warned that his troops would respond with greater force if shells from @entity9 continued to hit @entity7 territory			1
men , women and children crossed the narrow @entity29 river which marks the @entity9 - @entity7 border near the village of @entity32 in @entity33			1
villagers helped the families by ferrying them in small metal boats as they fled the violence in the @entity9 border town of @entity60 where several mortar shells landed early on wednesday			1
as heavy machine gun fire could be heard from the @entity7 side , smoke rose into the sky and cries of ' @entity68 is greatest ' rang out between the bursts of gunfire , a witness said			1
fleeing : a @entity9 family have boarded one of the small metal boats used to ferry @entity9 refugees over to the @entity7 side , helped by villagers from @entity74 escape : refugees are getting in to boats on the @entity9 side ' the firing started getting intense last night			1
some people have been killed , some are lying wounded on the road , ' said @entity83 , a 55 - year - old woman who crossed the river to @entity74			2
' people want to escape but they ca n't			2
many have settled in a field outside the town and are trying to come , ' she said			2
ambulances and medical aid waited on the @entity7 side of @entity29 , taking wounded to the main city of @entity94 or district hospitals			1
' do n't take me across , take me back			2
i want to return and fight , ' said one man in a blood - stained shirt , being carried from the river on a stretcher			0
the news of shelling on @entity60 came just before @entity7 's military chief of staff said that @entity7 will respond with greater force if @entity9 fire continues to hit its territory			1
after several attacks from their neighbour , @entity7 military forces have responded across the border to northern @entity9 , where president @entity41 's forces have been battling rebels			1
to safety : scores of @entity9 civilians have been crossing the river in an attempt to escape fighting in @entity60 and surrounding villages on the @entity9 side conflict : civilians flee the @entity9 civil war in their thousands , a conflict which now threatens to spread to @entity7 ‘ we responded but if it continues we will respond with greater force , ’ @entity7 's chief of staff , general @entity124 , told state television @entity125			1
it is not clear whether the shells that have hit @entity7 territory in the past week have been aimed towards the nation or if @entity9 troops have made mistakes when attacking rebel positions			1
@entity135 secretary - general @entity134 said on tuesday the military alliance had plans in place to defend @entity7			1
he gave no further details , but a senior @entity10 defense official said @entity135 would likely react if @entity7 made a request for assistance			2
@entity14 and other neighbouring countries are increasingly worried that the violence will spill over to countries south of @entity9			2
the beginning : smoke from a @entity9 mortar bomb rises near the border in @entity7 @entity33 on monday , which led to a retaliatory strike from @entity7 for the sixth consecutive day the 150 troops sent by the @entity10 to @entity14 are intended to provide support to the @entity10 ally as they deal with the increasing influx of @entity9 refugees			1
the specialist task force is also preparing to move in to help secure the @entity9 regime ’s chemical weapons should president @entity41 lose control over these			2
the @entity10 force is stationed about 35 miles from the border and officials told the @entity164 that there has been talks of a buffer zone in @entity9 where @entity14 troops would operate with @entity10 military as logistical support			1
protection : a @entity7 tank near the @entity174 border crossing , southern @entity176 province , last week after the @entity7 military stepped up their guard dark horizons : earlier this week , @entity7 president @entity180 said the escalating conflict was ' the worst - case scenario we have all been dreading ' @entity7 side : a boy rides past the soldiers on guard on the border between the two countries the number of refugees registered with the @entity20 has drastically increased , reaching 335,000			1
however the real figure could be as high as 500,000 , a @entity20 refugee agency official said yesterday			2
the @entity194 said last month that up to 700,000 refugees may flee the violence in @entity9 by the end of the year , four times higher than its june prediction			1
most of those fleeing are taking refuge in neighbouring @entity14 , @entity202 and @entity7			2
the sharp rise in casualties and refugees indicates the growing intensity of the conflict , which developed from peaceful protests against @entity41 in march 2011 into a full - scale civil war			1
an estimated 30,000 people have been killed as main cities such as @entity212 , @entity213 and the capital @entity215 are savagely contested			0
not backing down : a mobile missile launcher protecting the @entity7 side this weekend , shortly after prime minister @entity216 warned @entity215 that @entity7 would not shy away from war if provoked taking charge : @entity9 president @entity41 after a wave of defections and rebel attacks on strategic government targets , president @entity41 has assumed personal command of his forces , still convinced he can win through numbers			1
a picture posted on his @entity231 page shows the the 47 - year - old dressed in full military regalia , summing up his transformation since the july bomb attack which killed his inner circle security leadership , including his brother - in - law and defence minister			0
recent visitors say it strengthened president @entity41 ’s conviction and he has now taken full responsibility for the day - to - day leadership			0
‘ he is no longer a president who depends on his team and directs through his aides			0
' this is a fundamental change in @entity41 's thinking , ’ said a @entity248 @entity202 politician close to @entity41			0
‘ now he is involved in directing the battle			0
’ ' the fighting nerve is steady			0
the @entity251 and the @entity39 may have helped them			0
their ability to manage daily and control the situation has improved			0
’ it is a self - confident leader who has ordered his military to focus on the capital of @entity215 and the second largest city of @entity212 , which has seen a majority of the conflict			2
however , observers say @entity41 ’s victimisation of the regime is ludicrous and that he is deluded if he thinks he can win			0
‘ the problem is the regime lives in its own world			0
it is clear the people are rejecting this idea that it is a secular regime set upon by extremists , ’ a @entity266 diplomat said			0
‘ @entity41 is not the victim			0
he is the cause of the violence			0
’ other observers of the escalating conflict say the question may no longer be one of @entity41 ’s presidency , but of the existence of @entity9 as a nation			1
‘ everybody is kind of hypnotised by the issue of whether @entity41 is president or not , whether he is leaving or not , ’ said one @entity286 official			0
‘ i fear the problem is much bigger than that			0
the problem is to see how @entity9 is going to survive , how the new @entity9 is going to be born			2
’ a factor which has helped @entity41 to hold on to power is the failure of the rebel forces to unite under one command			0
religious and ideological disagreements among rebels have led to clashes as they fail to find common ground on issues other than the ousting of president @entity41			0
the rebel forces have failed to keep control of their claimed territories under attacks from the government and in the frustration have switched tactics to suicide bombings and hit - and - run attacks			0
‘ militarily the regime is more relaxed but from a security position the country is falling apart , ’ said the @entity248 @entity202 politician			0
‘ an explosion might happen anywhere , an assassination might happen , the situation is chaotic and out of control			0
’ he added that the following months will be crucial to the war as the satiation depends on @entity39 support , the @entity10 election and the situation in neighbouring @entity251 .			0
