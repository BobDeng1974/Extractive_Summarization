by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 are preparing to enter into the new season with morale at rock bottom			1
the club ’s players returned to their @entity9 training ground last week only to be shocked by the cost - saving measures brought in by new owner @entity11			1
the kitchen which used to lay on breakfast and a hot lunch for the squad after training is now closed and youth - team players have been sent out to bring in sandwiches			1
ringing the changes : @entity20 with former @entity2 manager @entity21 , who left in may the laundry service which provides the players with their daily training kit is also gone			1
and a training - ground source told @entity26 : ‘ it ’s ridiculous			1
it ’s all the players can talk about			1
‘ there is no hot food for the lads and the younger boys have been going out to get sandwiches			1
‘ the players would n’t mind even if they had to pay a few quid for some hot food after training and in the morning but there is nothing at all			1
‘ then there is the laundry situation – there are n’t even any underpants for the lads to train in			1
‘ the message from the club seems to be “ like it or lump it ” and it ’s fair to say that morale in the squad is pretty low right now			1
’ it all made for a troubled atmosphere in which new head coach @entity53 met his players for the first time			2
but the @entity57 boss – a surprise appointment two weeks ago – is fully signed up to @entity60 ’s austerity measures			0
on his way : @entity62 striker @entity62 is on the verge of a move to @entity65 the 56 - year - old said : ‘ we are going to have to get rid of all the excess baggage			2
there ’s too much excess baggage at @entity2 in every department			0
‘ we need to pare things back , get it right back to the bones and start fleshing it out as we want			0
‘ it will be ongoing and from a business point of view , that ’s mr @entity11 ’s business			0
‘ it ’s just too much , we are haemorrhaging in every department			0
i am sure there will be people unfortunately going out and that ’s life , not just football , on and off the pitch			0
’ it is all a far cry from the excesses of the @entity90 regime of the early 2000s which saw @entity2 reach the semi-finals of the @entity93 and break the @entity95 transfer record when they paid £ 18m for @entity97 from @entity98 in 2000			0
they were eventually relegated in 2004 and have remained outside of the top flight for a decade , dropping into the third tier for three seasons between 2007 and 2010			0
their current transfer embargo is expected to be lifted and @entity60 ’s @entity106 connection has seen a number of players from @entity109 linked with a move to @entity111			2
new head coach : @entity53 joined the club two weeks ago @entity62 striker @entity62 is on the verge of a move to @entity65 , although their £ 7m valuation is short of the £ 10m @entity60 is demanding			0
goalkeeper @entity118 – who reported back for training looking decidedly out of shape – is also on his way out of the club			2
our source added : ‘ it ’s probably going to get worse before it ever gets better			2
‘ the players are expecting more to leave and they ’re not sure about a lot of the foreign names which have been mentioned with regards coming in			2
‘ the lads were also surprised about the new coach and most of them had never heard of him			0
’ a squad of 20 players are currently at a training camp in @entity137 in northern @entity106			1
they kick off their @entity140 campaign with a trip to @entity142 on august 9 but bookmakers price them at just 7/2 to be relegated come the end of the season			0
a distant memory : @entity2 broke the @entity95 transfer record in 2000 when they paid £ 18million for @entity97 from @entity98			0
