lifting the lid on what she calls the ' unprofessional ' , ' chaotic ' and ' terribly depressing ' @entity13 chain which offers a 9,982 - calorie @entity14 and serves patrons over 350 pounds for free , the unidentified ex-hostess blasted the grill in a question and answer session online yesterday			1
nothing was off - limits as the waitress attacked the skimpy nurse uniform she was made to wear , how she recoiled at creepy customers who looked forward to a spanking with a paddle for not finishing their meal and how the urinals are covered in pictures of pointing women making fun of over-fed customer 's manhood 's			1
scroll down for @entity34 unhealthy : the @entity2 , pictured , is famous for selling the world 's most calorific burger describing the food at the restaurant , which holds the @entity41 world record for the ' most calorific burger ' , as ' disgusting ' , the unidentified hostess , who admitted she was a vegan took to social media sharing website , @entity44 , to air her grievances			1
the former waitresses name was not offered up in the ' @entity47 , but she provided photos of herself as proof of her employment , which have since been removed			0
in the tell - all post , the lady claimed that in the summer of 2012 she was told by her manager that day to record a video of a customer who had passed out trying to fill his stomach with the enormous burgers served at the @entity2			1
' at one point , the man passed out			2
i heard him knock onto the hard ground			0
we had to call an ambulance			0
a manager made me take out my cell phone to record a video of the whole thing , so they could send it to the media , ' wrote the hostess on @entity44			2
nurse and patient : a happy customer of the @entity2 in @entity13 poses with one of the hostess dressed in a nurses outfit as he prepares to eat his 8,000 - calorie @entity78 ' it was on a friday afternoon , and he hoped it would make the news so they could have a busy weekend			1
the food may or may not have been responsible for what happened to that man			0
' this is the latest of many incidences for the notorious @entity13 restaurant			1
just last week , @entity89 , the founder and owner of @entity2 appeared on @entity91 and unapologetically told viewers that his food causes people to die			1
' i am probably the only restaurateur in the entire world who is unapologetically telling you that my food is bad for you , that it will kill you and that you should stay away from it , ' he said			0
in the disturbing interview , the fast - food supremo produced a clear plastic bad filled with a suspicious powder like substance and declared , ' i 'm here with the cremated remains of someone who died at my restaurant			2
' he died of a heart attack at my restaurant , and i 'm putting the bag clearly on the table			2
i wish that @entity112 , @entity113 , and everyone else would do the same thing			0
' danger : the owner said he discourages people from visiting the restaurant more than once a month the disgruntled former hostess exposed the seedy goings - on inside the restaurant , which started life in @entity124 , @entity125 , just outside @entity126			1
describing the practice of spanking customer 's who fail to finish their gargantuan meals , the waitress was ambivalent			2
' it depended on who was doing spanking , ' said the ex-hostess			0
' some girls were rough and put all their strength into it			0
i was a weakling and would lightly tap , because i also have terrible coordination and was scared i would miss and actually hurt someone			0
' also , we 'd go lighter on females			0
' inside the restaurant , which is designed to resemble a hospital , the waitresses wear sexy nurses uniforms , administering food as ' prescriptions ' and customers who weigh over 350 pounds are able to eat for free			1
' there is a scale in the middle of the restaurant where customer 's are weighted , ' said the hostess			1
' if they pass , the scale lights up and people applaud			2
' second death : former @entity2 spokesman @entity162 , pictured , died aged 29 in 2011 owner : ' doctor @entity164 takes the pulse of @entity166 in his hospital - themed restaurant heart stopper : a customer shows off the @entity41 world record - breaking burger containing 9,982 calories indeed , she reserved some of her deepest scorn for these free - loaders and claims there is a hardcore of regulars who eat almost daily for free			1
' we 'd get a few locals who would come in frequently to take advantage of the free meal			1
most of them will come in , not get a drink , and not leave a tip. so that they could literally have a free meal , ' said the waitress			2
the waitress also spoke about how condescending she felt the customers to the @entity13 restaurant were			1
' people would always talk down to us employees as well , because 1			2
our uniforms were provocative , therefore in their minds we were all brainless and 2			2
how we are the immoral ones for serving them that food			0
because it 's not like people have freedom of choice when it comes to their eating habits			2
' explaining that staff are paid $ 11 an hour plus tips , the poster claimed that on a good night she could make up to $ 300			0
hitting back in an emailed statement to the @entity210 , @entity2 founder @entity89 identified the former employee and described her as ' attention seeking			1
' ' she had a pathetic work ethic , never made friends with her co-workers , and was continually reprimanded for cell texting friends , and we received continual costumer compliant about her poor attitude , ' he added			0
watch video here : @entity223 : this customer has his ' prescription ' administered by one of the @entity2 nurses in @entity13 despite this , the scathing attack caught the attention of @entity44 users			1
' what was it like being surrounded by the fall of western civilization ? ' one @entity232 asked the former hostess			2
' it was terribly depressing , ' she responded			1
' everyday we would have 5 - 10 people come in who actually qualify for the free meal			1
and that 's when i would feel bad about contributing to their bad health			0
' the restaurant chain - founded in 2005 using the catchphrase ' @entity249 ! ' - is run by a former nutritionist ' doctor ' @entity89 who , remarkably , used to run a @entity252 weight loss diet centre			0
meals can exceed 8,000 calories			0
the recommended daily intake is 2,000 calories for women and 2,500 for men			0
the @entity259 contains three slabs of meat , 12 rashes of bacon , cheese , red onion , sliced tomato and the @entity2 's own ' unique special sauce '			1
and that 's before taking into account the accompanying ' @entity270 ' , cooked in pure lard , and a giant soft drink			0
a sign at the entrance to an @entity125 branch of the restaurant chain reads : ' go away			0
if you come in this place , it â€™s going to kill you			0
' do you feel better ? the anonymous @entity44 poster said that she felt sorry for the majority of customers who pile in through the doors of the @entity285 but the chain has provoked widespread anger with promotions including offering free food to morbidly obese customers			1

' he 'd say , " i just love your place , @entity164			0
" he 's the only person i know who was probably at the restaurant more than @entity306 ' @entity307 is the second @entity2 spokesman to die ; in march 2011 , 29 - year - old @entity308 passed away			1
