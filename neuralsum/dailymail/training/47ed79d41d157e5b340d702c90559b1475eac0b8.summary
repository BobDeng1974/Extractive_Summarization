they are scenes of extraordinary tenderness – and trust			2
the first photograph shows the controversial moment that a father allowed his 18 - month - old daughter to play with a 300lb gorilla			1
and the experience seems to have taught the little girl , @entity8 , a lesson in confidence and courage			1
this time , though , the embrace is the result of a truly touching reunion			2
@entity8 is the eldest daughter of maverick conservationist @entity36 , and the gorilla she is cuddling is @entity25 , one of the animals she played with as a child at @entity41 ’s @entity40 in @entity19			1
during their embrace they rub noses , share kisses and sniff each other in a deep animal ritual			0
the bond is clearly strong – and made even more remarkable by the fact that this was the first time they ’d seen each other for 12 years , after @entity25 was returned to the wild in 2002			1
the reunion , film of which can be watched on @entity55 , took place four months ago in the rain forest of @entity28 when father and daughter journeyed in a small boat up a river deep into the jungle , on what seemed like an impossible mission to find @entity25 and another gorilla , @entity66 , who also used to live at the animal park			1
remarkably , after @entity8 and her father had been searching for just a few hours in the tropical heat , they spotted two familiar faces peering quizzically from the dense forest			1
and , despite not having seen their human friends for many years , the now fully grown male apes emerged to enthusiastically embrace them			1
old friends : @entity76 wanders out of undergrowth to check on the visitors in the boat on the river is it you ? after greeting @entity36 , @entity25 rubs and sniffs @entity8 in a bonding ritual @entity8 , now 25 and a jewellery designer , has no recollection of her first close encounter with a gorilla , when her father put her into the gorilla pen and captured the moment on camera			1
the video caused a huge public outcry when he at last released it publicly two years ago			1
@entity8 does , however , vividly remember playing with @entity25 and @entity66 , and the trip to the vast reserve in @entity28 that her father ’s foundation runs was , she says , like a happy family reunion			1
she recalls : ‘ my sister @entity99 and i often played with @entity25 and @entity66 on the lawn and sometimes we went into the cages with other gorillas			1
i loved being around them all , but those two guys were really very special to us , like our relatives			0
‘ i last saw them when i was ten and they were being crated up for the trip to the conservation site in @entity28			1
‘ when we set out to find them again i was a little apprehensive at first because i did n’t know if they would remember me after all that time , or if they had become hardened by life and possibly dangerous			0
‘ so , it was amazing to see that not only did they know me , but they had such gentle looks on their faces that i felt immediately safe and reassured			0
at no point did i feel fear			0
they had some rough and tumble with dad , but were really very gentle with me			0
‘ @entity124 greeted them first and made sure it was safe before i got close			0
he would never let me near an overly aggressive gorilla			2
’ sitting in the elegant surroundings of her father ’s headquarters in @entity131 , she certainly shows no signs of any adverse effects from the encounter			2
this is not entirely surprising , given that her grandfather was the legendary gambler and maverick zoo keeper @entity138 , who collected exotic pets and passed on his all - consuming passion for wildlife			2
he insisted that his keepers should interact closely with all his animals – a contentious policy that saw five of them killed during the 1980s and 1990s			0
and it was a tradition , @entity8 says , for family members to meet and interact with the gorillas			1
hug : @entity8 and the gorilla enjoy a warm embrace as the pair reacquaint themselves with each other shared passion : @entity8 and her father @entity36 , 54 , have a shared love for wild animals and have devoted time to saving endangered species @entity36 ’s childhood playmates included tigers , wolves and gorillas , and he has taken on the work started by his father with zeal			1
the 54 - year - old millionaire casino - owner , once a regular on the international party circuit , has devoted his life and considerable fortune to saving endangered species			2
he has run @entity23 and @entity172 wildlife parks in @entity19 as well as the @entity173 , since his father ’s death in 2000 , and has just published a book charting the foundation ’s 30 years of work , to celebrate the landmark occasion			1
he is understandably proud that for the past 15 years the charity has done more than any other organisation to breed animals threatened with extinction – especially gorillas – and return them back into the wild he says : ‘ we have sent bison to @entity201 , hyenas to @entity192 , gibbons to @entity188 and even wild horses back to @entity190			1
a few days ago we released eight @entity194 langurs into the wild of @entity188			0
we are the only organisation in the world doing this and fills me with pride			0
’ like his father , who made his fortune from his @entity205 casinos and spent it on creating country estates for his wild animals , @entity36 uses the profits of his property and gambling empire to keep his charity afloat , as well as funding the patrolling of the foundation ’s conservancies in @entity192 , which span about 1 million acres			2
he employs 24 - hour armed guards to protect the animals and his staff from poachers , along with vets , whisperers and naturalists to nurture and teach the gorillas , rhinos and monkeys how to live in the wild as they make the transition to freedom			1
although his maverick style of conservation has long been looked on with suspicion by the zoological establishment , there is no questioning the success of his methods			0
they include giving his animals the freshest fruit and vegetables , sunday roasts and even chocolates on special occasions			0
good old days : @entity8 with her mother @entity242 and one of the gorillas at the zoo in @entity19 but , @entity36 insists , what makes his foundation the best at what it does , is the fact that the animals are treated as equals			1
‘ we love them and recognise that they have as much right to be here as humans			0
we spend £ 10,000 a week buying the best fruit and vegetables from @entity261			0
why should they get second rate food – we do n’t			0
’ of course , he has not made friends in the establishment with his criticism of conventional zoos and what he calls ‘ their barbaric ethos ’			0
he would like them phased out , ‘ with a few exceptions , ’ over the next 30 years			2
‘ it ’s like locking children up - it ’s deeply unethical , ’ he insists			2
since its inception , the charity has enjoyed unprecedented breeding and reintroduction successes with gorillas , with over 130 births and over 80 of the animals released back into the wild – more than any other organisation in the world			2
there have been disappointments too ; a family of ten gorillas that @entity36 and @entity8 took to @entity28 in june has already lost half its members			1
it is believed they may have been killed by other gorillas			2
despite this setback , @entity36 says the other freed primates are living completely wild and are happy , healthy and calm			0
‘ @entity25 and @entity66 looked healthy and settled			1
it ’s nonsense that some scientists say they ’ve lost their wild instincts			0
these animals have a right to go home			0
nobody can convince me they do n’t belong here			0
’ a life with animals is available from aspinallfoundation.org at £ 20 plus £ 3.99 p&p .			0

@entity8 , 25 , was reunited with gorillas she knew as a child
her father took controversial pictures of a gorilla holding her as a baby
years later the pair went to @entity28 to track down their beloved apes
amazingly two of them emerged from the rainforest to meet the @entity322
one of the gorillas , @entity25 , sniffed @entity8 before recognising her scent
heart - warming pictures show gorilla and woman embracing each other
