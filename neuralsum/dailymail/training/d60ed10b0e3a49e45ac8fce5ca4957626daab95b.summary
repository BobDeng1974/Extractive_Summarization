by @entity0 published : 07:38 est , 5 march 2013 updated : 13:01 est , 5 march 2013 gone are the days of long exposures and image distortion – @entity3 has unveiled a new camera sensor that can capture photos and videos in very low light			1
the new sensor is able to capture well - defined pictures of stars without the photographer having to take a long exposure or increase the camera ’s sensitivity			1
it can even be used to ' see in the dark ' and take pictures of friends at night without the need for any lighting			0
it has also been used to capture a man ’s face in a room lit only by three incense sticks			0
this is possible because @entity3 has used new technologies in the pixels and readout circuitry which reduces noise			2
thanks to this technology , the sensor facilitates the shooting of clearly visible video images even in dimly lit environments with as little as 0.03 lux of illumination , or approximately the brightness of a crescent moon the full - frame , 35mm - film - size , camera sensor is even more specialised than @entity3 ’s earlier dslrs which , themselves , are known for their low - light performance			1
a promotional video produced by @entity3 shows that the camera can capture shooting stars @entity3 's promotional video shows the difference between the images captured by an old camera and those captured using the new sensor the cmos sensor features pixels measuring 19 microns square in size , which is more than 7.5 times the surface area of the pixels on the cmos sensor incorporated in @entity3 ’s top of the range slr cameras			1
it can be used to film full - hd video but it is only able to create video footage from a 1920 x 1080 array meaning that it only has one photosite per output pixel so can not offer the same colour resolution as @entity3 ’s @entity80 professional video camera			2
@entity3 believes that the first generation of this technology will be used primarily in non-consumer applications , such as surveillance , medical research and astronomical observation			2
it contains new technologies in the pixels and readout circuitry			0
these new technologies facilitate shooting of clearly visible video images even in dimly lit environments with as little as 0.03 lux of illumination			0
it features pixels measuring 19 microns square in size - this is more than 7.5 times the surface area of the pixels on the cmos sensor incorporated in @entity3 's top of the range slr cameras			1
it can be used to film full - hd video			0
however , it is only able to create video footage from a 1920 x 1080 array meaning that it only has one photosite per output pixel so can not offer the same colour resolution of the @entity80 .			0

@entity3 's new camera sensor can take photos and videos in lower light
it can capture stars without long exposure or increased camera sensitivity
it could be used in medical sensors - and even *telescopes*
