a woman has lost an incredible ten stone after she became so fat that she broke her sofa			1
@entity3 , 53 , from @entity4 , ballooned to a size 28 after years of overeating and snacking on treats and chocolate			1
but she was finally spurred into action when she slumped on the sofa after a long day and the springs gave way under her 24st frame			2
@entity3 , 53 , from @entity4 , weighed 24st ( left ) after gorging on junk food for years			1
she finally managed to lose 10st after starting the 80/20 diet , which allows treats 20 per cent of the time			1
she currently weighs 14st ( right ) and is on track to reach her final goal of 11st @entity3 was so determined to do something about her weight that she turned down the chance to get a gastric band fitted and opted to shed to flab the hard way instead			2
the customer care worker tried everything from juice diets to calorie counting and managed to get her weight down to 20st , but then she hit a wall			1
it was only when she sought help from weight loss expert @entity30 , after seeing him on @entity33 's @entity32 , that she finally mastered a weight loss regime			2
@entity3 has now lost more than ten stone by following an 80/20 regime			1
the three - meal - a - day plan allows the dieter to indulge in their favourite treats 20 per cent of the time , so long as they eat healthily for the remaining 80 per cent			0
@entity3 tried every diet under the sun , but never managed to lose much weight @entity3 currently weighs 14st and is well on track to reach her final goal of 11st			1
she said : ' for as long as i can remember , i 've always been overweight			0
' my husband and i have been married for 33 years and i have literally been on a diet for the whole time			2
' there is no diet that anyone can name that i have n't tried			0
' occasionally , i would drop a few stone here and there but it would just pile back on			0
' i mean , if weighing 20st was after weight loss then that 's saying something ! ' since losing 10 stone , @entity3 now enjoys wearing fitted dresses and has started to wear make - up again @entity3 continued : ' i remember meeting with my gp when he told me about gastric band surgery and i was absolutely mortified			1
' ' i remember thinking i would rather die from being fat than have surgery - it 's just something i would never even contemplate			0
' the first time i met with @entity30 , he told me i was really fat and it was what i needed to hear			0
' he has never let me make excuses and always encouraged me to do more , i never thought i would be able to lose so much weight and keep it off			0
' i 've started wearing make - up again and i 'm always receiving lovely compliments			0
