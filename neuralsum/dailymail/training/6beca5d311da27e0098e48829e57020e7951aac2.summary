by @entity0 published : 06:59 est , 2 august 2012 updated : 09:08 est , 2 august 2012 @entity1 : @entity3 systematically rape of a young girl over the course of 14 years the ringleader of a gang of men who groomed vulnerable girls for sex has today also been jailed for 22 years for a ' campaign of rape ' against a different child in his own community			1
@entity3 , 59 , led an exploitation ring of nine men who were all imprisoned earlier this year after they abused many young girls in the @entity19 and @entity20 areas			1
he was jailed for 19 years in may following an 11 - week trial at @entity22 relating to their violent abuse			1
and today he can be named as he received another prison term - to run concurrently - after he was also convicted in june of 30 counts of child rape in his own area			1
his identity was kept secret to allow him a fair trial			0
a jury heard he raped and sexually abused the innocent youngster over many years and treated her as a ' possession ' whom he used for his own sexual gratification			1
@entity3 , of @entity20 , will in effect serve an additional three years to the sentence imposed at @entity22			1
sentencing him at @entity39 , judge @entity38 was forced to removed @entity3 from the dock before he passed sentence as he was persistently interrupted by the defendant			1
before his ejection , @entity3 shouted : ' it ’s all lies			1
it ’s all concocted by the police			1
' he then looked over at the @entity50 bench and snarled : ' what are you looking at ? ' the court heard that @entity3 remained ' in denial ' of his guilt of the repeated rapes of his victim for more than a decade			2
his victim was ' completely vulnerable ' and too young to understand what was happening to her when he first abused her			2
it then became a case of control and power amid a background of ' intimidation and coercion ' , said the judge			0
jailed : the rapist was jailed again at @entity69 just two months after being jailed for his part in a large sex gang on occasion she would protest and cry but @entity3 would continue , he added			1
the judge said an aggravating feature was that the defendant did not use any protection while raping the girl			2
the jury in his trial was told that the victim felt a sense of shame about what happened to her , which stopped her reporting it to the police for many years			2
she had ' rejected the idea of ever marrying or having a sexual relationship with a man of her choosing ' because of the impact of what she had suffered			0
today the court heard the victim suffered from low self - confidence and had been forced to move away because she can not face people in her community			2
judge @entity38 said : ' her future prospects are bleak , as she puts it			0
' she still lives under fear because of what the defendant might do when he comes out of prison			0
' explaining his sentencing , he said : ' these are serious offences but i have taken care in considering whether a life sentence is appropriate in this case			2
shame : the abuse of the gang he ran began at two takeaways in the @entity120 area of @entity19 , including the @entity121 ( pictured ) , which is under new ownership also under new ownership : the @entity124 takeaway - now renamed @entity125 's and sold on to new owners - was the other takeaway at the centre of the scandal ' given that the defendant is already serving a 19 - year sentence that was imposed earlier this year at another court , i think that in my judgment the public will be protected from him , as will the victim , if i was to pass a determinate sentence in this case which will run concurrently to the sentence he is already serving			1
' this was a campaign of rape			0
there are no extenuating circumstances			0
' @entity3 's life as an abuser was laid bare by his involvement , kept secret until today , with a sex gang that terrorised a large area of north west @entity151			1
he and several others raped vulnerable teenage girls - who he told to call him ' daddy '			0
the pervert would befriend his teenage victims and ply them with alcohol before carrying out his attacks			0
the takeaway worker and former taxi driver was given a 19 - year sentence for conspiracy , two rapes , aiding and abetting rape , sexual assault and sex trafficking			1
one of @entity3 's victims in the original grooming case said his public naming - and - shaming had finally brought her some closure			2
the girl - who was herself raped by @entity3 after he plied her with vodka above the @entity124 takeaway in @entity120 - said : ' i 'm just glad people can know who he is and what he 's done			1
he 's just such an evil man			0
i know what he 's done to me - it 's obvious now from this second trial that he 's been doing this for years and ruined a lot of lives			0
' if anybody deserves to spend the rest of their lives in prison , it 's him			0
i 'm just relieved it 's all over - it 's some kind of justice			0
' her father , who watched from the public gallery as @entity3 was convicted in may said : ' he is horrible , evil - the vilest , most perverted individual			2
' this will never go away for my daughter and all the other victims			0
he has condemned them to a lifetime of torture thinking about what he 's done			0

@entity3 , 59 , imprisoned for 22 years today for abuse of a young girl
he has been named today as the ringleader of a separate sex gang who raped others for which he was jailed for 19 years in may
@entity3 shouted ' it ’s all lies . it ’s all concocted by the police , ' as he received his sentence
