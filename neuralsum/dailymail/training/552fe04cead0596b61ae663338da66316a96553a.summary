by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor universities minister @entity2 said all universities can do is ask students if they have booked a flight home universities can not be expected to march foreign students to the airport when their course ends , senior @entity6 minister @entity2 has warned			1
the universities minister told @entity1 lecturers could ‘ ask in a friendly way ’ when graduates were planning to return home			1
but he insisted they can not be forced to track them once their course ends or ‘ escort ’ them to the airport			1
it puts him at odds with home secretary @entity23 who wants new rules to force colleges to make sure students from overseas do not stay on once their visas run out			1
official figures suggest that around 100,000 foreign students stay on in @entity31 illegally each year			0
according to the @entity33 , 145,000 non-eu students arrived here in 2012			0
yet last year , only 50,000 non-eu students returned to their home countries			1
mrs may wants the @entity6 manifesto to include a pledge to force colleges and universities to take responsibility for making sure foreign students go home			1
but universities say they can not be held responsible for what ex-students do after they leave their course			2
now their opposition has been backed by mr @entity2 , who warned the most universities could do was ask if students from overseas were planning their return			2
he pointed to the @entity53 which runs a scheme where they ‘ monitor and ask ’ overseas students who are coming to the end of their course if they are preparing to return to their home country			2
mr @entity2 said they ask : ‘ have you booked your flight , when are you planning to go home , all that kind of thing , asked in a friendly way			0
’ he told @entity1 : ‘ at the moment universities do n't have a legal responsibility for escorting students to the airport			1
‘ my view is overseas students come here to study and after that they either have to go back home or they 've got a suitable level of job to stay on to do post-study work			2
‘ universities can help us ensure that students go home			1
’ last year 177,000 people came to the @entity31 for formal study , according to the @entity33 said he played down the suggestion of a ‘ massive dispute ’ between the @entity82 and the @entity83			0
‘ but there are limits to what they have got legal powers to do			0
they can ask them but if you have finished your degree at the end of june but your visa expires at the end of august , the university has n't currently got the legal powers to track its recent graduates up until the end of august			0
‘ but what they can do - and i encourage them to do this - what they can do when the students have finished their exams is say “ so you are planning to go back home at the end of august ? you know , what are going to do ? ” ‘ they can ask that information , then voluntarily the student can provide it			0
’ home secretary @entity23 wants the next @entity6 manifesto to include a pledge to force universities to take responsibility for making sure foreign students go home the @entity83 has been stung by criticism over its failure to reduce immigration to the ‘ tens of thousands ’			1
@entity122 and mrs may have repeated the @entity6 pledge many times since the coalition was formed , but the latest figures show net migration hit 201,000 in 2013			0
some have argued for students to be removed from the headline net migration figures , over fears it risked deterring people from choosing @entity31 universities			0
instead the @entity83 has proposed curbs on students bringing in dependants and sanctions against institutions which allow students to break the rules .			0
