mail ordering a bride is an ever growing business where desperate divorcees shell out thousands to fulfill their dreams of having an ' ideal ' wife			1
for the women in countries like @entity10 who sign up to meet a western man , it 's an opportunity to escape from poverty in their homeland			1
but the trade off is a marrying a man likely to be much older than they are - and in some cases , who wants a live - in maid more than a wife			2
the former glamour model is no stranger to unconventional marriage			0
she once tied the knot with a stranger for a tv show , something she now bitterly regrets			0
she said : ' my big day was a big disaster			0
my experience of marriage is horrendous and a joke			0
i got married as part of a tv show , it is my most embarrassing moment of my whole life			2

they have a happy relationship despite a 25 year age gap and now help other people follow in their footsteps			0
@entity146 said : ' everyone wants what we have			0
i tell men they have to have face to face introductions because you ca n't download a wife			2
' @entity147 said they organise their week - long trips with dating events so the men are not ' buying a wife ' but ' trying to win a woman 's heart '			1
found love : @entity146 and @entity170 met through an international dating agency and now help other couples do the same thing ( for a price ) @entity147 reveals to @entity25 what life was like before she married @entity146 and moved to @entity58 - she used to have to shower outside in the snow and earned £ 62 a month another success story : @entity178 , 57 , from the @entity179 , met his wife , @entity180 , 32 , in @entity10 it 's not difficult for them to find attractive , young women to sign up for their speed dating nights - which are conducted with the help of translators			1

there is nothing good for young people in @entity10			2
there are no good guys , just drug addicts and alcoholics			0
i 'm glad she met @entity146			0
it 's better than if she stayed here			0
' it 's this dream of a new life that inspires many of the girls to marry a man decades their senior			2
it 's estimated that 15,000 women a year are entering the @entity58 thanks to international dating agencies			1
as with @entity146 and @entity147 , it worked out for @entity215 , 57 , from the @entity179 , who met his wife , @entity180 , 32 , in @entity10			0
despite spending £ 10 - 12,000 on dating agencies and travel in order to have a relationship with her , he says he does n't feel like he bought her because they fell in love and have been happily married for four years			1
hoped for a fairytale ending : @entity226 from @entity227 thought she would live happily ever after in @entity58 after she became @entity229 's mail order bride nightmare : but @entity226 , pictured today , told @entity25 she became @entity229 's slave and punch bug @entity25 concludes that their relationship ' may have started as an online transaction but it has turned into something real and wonderful			1
' but not everyone she meets has lived happily ever after as a result of a being a mail order bride			1

' he hit me and i felt from that point it was n't going to get better			0
i wanted to go back to @entity227 , ' @entity226 told @entity25			2
but when she told @entity229 she was leaving , he cut his own arm with a knife and then rang the police to accuse his wife of attacking him			0
the charges against her were eventually dropped and she got a restraining order preventing @entity229 from going near her			0
when he broke this and approached her armed with a gun , he was shot dead by the police			0
while traumatised by his violent killing , @entity226 is also relieved , believing if he had lived , he would only have gone on to buy another wife and make her life hell			2
@entity266 is on @entity28 tonight at 10pm			0

mail ordering a bride is an ever growing business
@entity25 meets men hoping to find love this way
they spend thousands on international dating agencies
looking for a traditional wife who is ' attentive and appreciative '
young women sign up looking for chance to escape life of poverty
some do find real *happiness* but others are treated like slaves
