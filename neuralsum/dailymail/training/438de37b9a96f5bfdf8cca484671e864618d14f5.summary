the @entity1 will pay more than £ 400,000 in compensation to a woman who had a child by an undercover officer , it was claimed today			2
the woman , known only as @entity7 , has a son with @entity9 , who was revealed in 2012 as a member of the now - defunct @entity11 ( @entity11 ) which placed officers in deep - cover roles between 1968 and 2008			1
she was one of several women taking @entity16 action against the @entity1 over the actions of officers like @entity9 , whom she knew as ‘ @entity20 ’ when a young activist in the 1980s			1
undercover officer : the woman has a son with @entity9 ( above ) , who was revealed in 2012 as a member of the now - defunct @entity11 @entity7 is reportedly to receive £ 425,000 and in an interview with the @entity27 and the @entity28 , she said she had been receiving psychiatric care after learning of his real identity as a police officer who was married with children			1
she said : ‘ the legal case is finished but there is no closure for me			0
there is the money , but there is no admission by the police that what they did was wrong , there is no meaningful apology and most importantly there are no answers			0
’ ‘ i do n't know why i was singled out by the police to be duped into an intimate sexual relationship with @entity9			2
‘ i do n't know if he was paid overtime to be with me during the 14 hours of labour i went through giving birth to our son			2
’ in august four former @entity11 officers were told they faced no criminal charges for their actions			1
the @entity59 said there was not enough evidence to charge four officers with sexual misconduct offences			0
the @entity1 was previously forced to name two officers who allegedly had relationships with women activists in groups they infiltrated after high court judge mr @entity68 ruled the force could not use its policy of ‘ neither confirm nor deny ’ ( @entity72 ) in response to the damages claims			1
known as ' @entity20 ' : the woman said she had been receiving psychiatric care after learning of @entity9 's real identity as a police officer who was married with children @entity81 : the woman was one of several women taking @entity16 action against the @entity1 over the actions of officers like @entity9 as a result , the force confirmed @entity88 and @entity9 were undercover police officers			1
request : sir @entity91 ( pictured ) , the @entity1 commissioner , has been told by the woman 's lawyer that he should publicly condemn the practice of undercover officers having sexual relationships @entity97 , @entity7 's lawyer , told the @entity27 and @entity28 that sir @entity91 , the @entity1 commissioner , should publicly condemn the practice of undercover officers having sexual relationships			1
mr @entity97 told them : ‘ the @entity1 are prepared to criticise the conduct of an individual officer , @entity9			1
they are even prepared to be critical of the unit he was from - but they refuse to condemn the practice itself			0
‘ it is time for the commissioner of @entity1 to publicly commit to seeing the end of this shameful and abusive practice ’			2
a @entity81 spokesman said the force ‘ unreservedly apologises for any pain and suffering that the relationship with @entity9 , an undercover officer , has had on this woman ’ but said that it had ‘ never had a policy that officers can use sexual relations for the purposes of policing ’			2
he said : ‘ we recognise the impact that the revelation that he was an undercover police officer must have had both on her and her son			0
from the outset we have dealt with this lengthy case with professionalism and sensitivity , completely understanding the gravity of the circumstances			0
we regret if this necessarily complex process has added to her distress			0
‘ we want to be , and have tried hard to be , as open as we possibly can			0
arguing the need to maintain the policy of neither confirm nor deny in relation to undercover operations has never been a refusal to accept wrongdoing , but has been done solely to protect a vital policing tactic			0
' fathering a child while working undercover proved no barrier to @entity9 ’s successful 30 - year career with the @entity1			1
in fact , after five years spent infiltrating left - wing groups in the 1980s he was promoted to oversee more junior members of the notorious @entity11			1
over the next two decades he became an expert in combating @entity152 and right - wing extremism			0
he was even awarded an mbe in 2008 for ‘ services to police work ’ after retiring into academia			0
when @entity7 , the mother of @entity9 ’s child , recognised him in a report on the undercover policing scandal , she managed to track him down to @entity162			1
he was reunited with his son , now in his 20s , and @entity7 learned @entity9 ’s other two children had died from a genetic heart defect – which thankfully , their son does not share			1
fighting back tears yesterday , @entity7 said she has become friends with @entity9 and his second wife			1
describing their first conversation on the phone , she said : ‘ i had not spoken to him since he walked out on me but i instantly knew it was him			0
’ @entity9 now works as a lecturer in terrorism studies at @entity177 and is a part - time senior lecturer at @entity179			2
