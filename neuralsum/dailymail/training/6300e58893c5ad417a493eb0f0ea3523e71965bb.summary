rapists and child abusers are escaping punishment and being allowed to walk free by police if they say sorry to their victims			0
new figures show that some those accused of sexual offences are being handed community resolution orders , also known as restorative justice			1
the orders are often used to punish youths so they do not get a criminal record and usually involve the offender making a verbal or written apology to their victim			0
in a return check last year , it found 58 people accused of sexual offence allegations , including five of rape , were handed the orders			2
crime statistics for the @entity39 force area show that between may 2013 and july 2014 , there were 142 violent and sexual crimes			2
now victims ' groups have spoken out and criticised the procedure saying it does not send a tough message to offenders that their behaviour is unacceptable			1
details of the practice at @entity25 were revealed in a report by @entity51 of @entity52 , which branded their use of community resolution orders for sexual offences as ' unacceptable '			1
the report states : ' an internal report in 2012/13 concludes that “ @entity25 has intentionally or inadvertently , manipulated the recording of sexual offences and thereby improved the perception of performance ”			1
' the report estimates the number of rapes not recorded at around 50 , and that around 30 serious sexual offences were dealt with by way of community resolutions including rape and sexual activity with a child			1
details of the practice of giving community orders to sex offenders at @entity25 , pictured , were revealed in a report by @entity51 of @entity52 ' the latest force checks have identified some 58 such outcomes , of which , in the previous year , five were for rape crimes			1
' @entity78 from the @entity79 told the @entity80 : ' the justice system needs to be more victim focused , and not a reflection on whether the perpetrator deserved prison or not			0
conservative mp @entity86 , who has said he will be calling on the government to review the use of the orders ' a custodial sentence for serious sexual offences is the only way to send a clear message that society will not accept their behaviour			1
' however the report added that the force , headed by new chief constable @entity98 , had made considerable investment into changing the culture , in making sure all offences are recorded			0
it comes after @entity103 revealed last month through figures obtained through freedom of information laws , that people arrested on suspicion of rape , child rape , creating child porn , child abduction and sexually abusing a mental patient escaped prosecution by apologising			2
the shocking figures from 38 of @entity114 and @entity116 ' police forces show resolution orders were used in 30 rape cases , including 21 involving children			1
one of the orders was given to a care worker in the @entity122 who caused a mental patient to engage in a penetrative sex act			2
five other orders involved kidnap or abduction , 75 were for sexually assaulting young children , and 284 sexual assaults were passed off with an apology			0
conservative mp @entity86 , who sits on the @entity132 justice committee , said he would be calling on the government to review the orders			0
he said : ' it 's shocking that offenders who admit to serious criminal offences are being offered the chance to say sorry and walk away from answering in a court of law for their crimes			0
' the data also showed that overall restorative justice had allowed 256,816 crimes to pass without offenders going to court in the last three - and - a - half years .			0
