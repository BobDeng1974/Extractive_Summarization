it comes as @entity0 's army this week officially cancelled an armistice it signed with the @entity2 at the end of @entity21 and as tensions look set to bubble over into all out warfare between the two countries			1
' this frenzy kicked up by the @entity2 warmongers is in no way irrelevant with the venomous swish of skirt made by the one who again occupies ' the presidential @entity32 , the @entity26 said in its statement			2
but despite that swipe , and a continuing torrent of rhetoric from @entity37 threatening nuclear war , president @entity3 has continued to vow to reach out to @entity0 's young leader , @entity39 , and to send the country much - needed humanitarian aid			1
the new @entity2 leader is trying to build trust with @entity37 , after five years of @entity2 tension , which has seen @entity0 nuclear tests , long - range rocket launches and attacks that left dozens of @entity2 dead			1
@entity3 's predecessor , @entity48 , infuriated @entity0 by linking aid and concessions to what transpired to be nonexistent progress on @entity0 's past commitments to abandon its atomic weapons ambitions			1
in doing so , he reversed past liberal governments ' policy of providing huge aid shipments with few strings attached			0
like @entity48 , @entity59 is a member of @entity2 's main conservative party , but she has promised to find a middle ground by re-engaging @entity37 through aid shipments , reconciliation talks and the resumption of some large - scale economic initiatives as progress occurs on the nuclear issue			2

the leader has been seen looking increasingly warlike in recent pictures posing next to tanks and guns @entity70 said @entity2 wo n't accept @entity0 's nuclear development or any provocations and called for a dialogue between the countries to improve strained ties			1
the @entity114 said today that @entity2 has not started discussing when to start making shipments , what aid items might be sent and how much it will send			0
@entity59 's @entity0 policy is of keen interest not only on the @entity119 but also among officials in @entity121 , @entity122 and @entity123			0
analysts believe her course will set the initial tone for new @entity0 policy in those capitals			0

speech : the dictatorial leader told troops to ' cut the windpipes ' of their enemies war ? @entity0 officials have cancelled a ceasefire agreement made with the south decades ago threat : @entity0 's @entity39 , pictured here with his troops , has pledged to attack his rivals hard man : over the past couple of days @entity39 appears to have projected a tougher image @entity0 's army this week officially cancelled an armistice it signed with the @entity2 at the end of @entity21			1
the move makes it more likely that recent tensions , prompted by new @entity170 sanctions as well as the joint military exercises which started yesterday , could bubble over into all - out warfare			0
@entity173 , the official newspaper of @entity39 's @entity174 , quoted an 80 - year - old veteran of the @entity21 supposedly expressed the national mood			2
' i am still keeping a bullet that i failed to fire at a trench in the 1950s because the @entity182 imperialists and their stooges signed an armistice agreement , ' he apparently said			0
' send me to the trench			0
i want to rain bullets on the enemy to my heart 's content			0
' @entity190 : official media have published a series of threats towards @entity2 and the @entity194 looking at a tank : @entity39 has made a series of visits to elite military installations in recent days crowd : @entity39 receives a rapturous response from an audience of soldiers at a military base @entity39 himself issued a direct threat to the @entity182 and @entity2 over their long - scheduled drills on the @entity119			1
' as the saying goes , a guy who is fond of playing with fire is bound to perish in flames , ' he told troops			0
' all the enemies quite often playing with fire in the sensitive hotspot should be thrown into a cauldron once i issue an order			0

inspection : @entity39 holds up a guitar at the base on an island near the border with @entity2 after the start of the military drills yesterday , @entity2 officials said their northern counterparts did not answer two calls on a hotline between the sides , apparently following through on an earlier vow to cut the communication channel because of the drills			1
@entity37 has launched a bombast - filled propaganda campaign against the drills , which involve 10,000 @entity2 and about 3,000 @entity182 troops , and last week 's @entity170 vote to impose new sanctions over the @entity0 's february 12 nuclear test			1
@entity37 is n't believed to be able to build a warhead small enough to mount on a long - range missile , and the @entity0 's military has repeatedly vowed in the past to scrap the 1953 armistice			2
@entity0 wants a formal peace treaty , security guarantees and other concessions , as well as the removal of 28,500 @entity182 troops stationed in @entity2			1
@entity2 and @entity182 officials have been closely monitoring @entity37 's actions and parsing the torrent of recent rhetoric from the @entity0 , which has been more warlike than usual			1
change of tune : just two weeks ago @entity39 was pictured enjoying himself with @entity277 star @entity233 @entity0 regularly claims @entity2 - @entity182 drills are a preparation for invasion , but @entity37 has signaled more worry about the drills that began monday			1
the drills follow @entity170 sanctions that the @entity0 says are the result of @entity182 hostility aimed at toppling its political system			1
@entity0 has also warned @entity2 of a nuclear war on the divided peninsula and said it was cancelling nonaggression pacts			2
under newly inaugurated president @entity3 , @entity2 's defence ministry , which often brushes off @entity0 threats , has looked to send a message of strength in response to the latest threats			1
the ministry warned on friday that the @entity0 's government would ' evaporate from the face of the @entity302 ' if it ever used a nuclear weapon			0
the @entity93 also said the @entity182 is fully capable of defending itself against a @entity0 ballistic attack			2
@entity0 has said the @entity182 mainland is within the range of its long - range missiles , and an army general told a @entity37 rally last week that the military is ready to fire a long - range nuclear - armed missile to turn @entity121 into a ' sea of fire			1
' best of friends : @entity39 at dinner in @entity37 with @entity233 and his wife @entity319 , left while outside scientists are still trying to determine specifics , the @entity0 's rocket test in december and third atomic bomb test last month may have pushed the country a step closer to acquiring the ability to hit the @entity182 with weapons of mass destruction			2
analysts , however , say @entity37 is still years away from acquiring the smaller , lighter nuclear warheads needed for a credible nuclear missile program			0
but there are still worries about a smaller conflict			0
@entity0 has a variety of missiles and other weapons capable of striking @entity2			2
in 2010 , @entity0 shelled a @entity2 island and allegedly torpedoed a @entity2 warship , killing a total of 50 @entity2			2
both incidents occurred near the disputed western sea boundary , a recurring flashpoint between the @entity92 that has seen three other bloody naval skirmishes since 1999			0
@entity39 visited two islands just north of the sea boundary last week and ordered troops there to open fire immediately if a single enemy shell is fired on @entity0 waters			0
