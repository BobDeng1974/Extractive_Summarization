are parents who opt for cosmetic surgery on their face unintentionally ruining their relationship with their children ? studies suggest that having @entity7 injections could alter the way infants perceive adults , leaving them unable to recognise emotion			1
this means that when an nip and tucked mother tries to empathise , the baby is left distraught as the adult seemingly appears unaffected by their behaviour			1
is cosmetic surgery leaving babies emotionally detached from their mothers ? studies suggest that ' enhancements ' such as @entity7 injections make it difficult for children to empathise with adults and recognise emotion in parents ( stock image shown ) last year more than 50,000 cosmetic surgery procedures were carried out in the @entity31 - a rise of 17 per cent on average from 2012			1
more than five in six people who have had @entity7 admit to having no idea what exactly was injected into their face			1
and new figures reveal today that more people than ever are seeking help after botched procedures			0
a shocking 84 per cent of youth - seekers admitted to having absolutely no idea what was going into their faces when under - going the procedure - or even if the injection given actually contained key ingredient @entity48 toxin			0
the national research carried out by the @entity54 company has found that almost a third ( 29 per cent ) of respondents said they had their treatment done at a local beauty salon , one in ten had one at home or a friend 's home , and 3 per cent were treated at a ' beauty treatment party '			2
and there does n’t seem to be any signs of the trend abating			0
by 2015 the global value of the plastic surgery industry is set to rise to £ 3.6 billion ( $ 6 billion ) , a rise of £ 1.3 billion ( $ 2.2 billion ) from 2010			2
a study carried out by dr @entity70 from the @entity71 in 2011 fouind that infants were unable to get an emotional response from adults who had had @entity7 injections			1
this left them distressed and upset as they lacked the ability to be empathetic with their parents			2
dr @entity70 said that when infants were unable to mimic their parents ’ emotions , such as showing sadness or happiness , they could sometimes be left confused			2
this suggests that , as more and more parents today turn to @entity7 to supposedly ‘ improve ’ their appearance in later life , they might be worsening their relationship with their children			1
this research has come to the fore again in recent days after a @entity31 artist spoke out against the use of plastic surgery in parents at the @entity101 in the @entity102			1
as reported by @entity104 , @entity103 said that cosmetic surgery was ‘ homogenising the way we look ’ in addition to the aforementioned negative effects on appearance			1
‘ what are the unintended long - term consequences of these things that we are doing casually for our own gratification ? ‘ aside from the fact it is risky , it is painful , it is expensive , it is often quite obvious you have had it done			0
’ @entity103 has himself studied cosmetic - surgery patients and their sometimes painful pursuits of achieving physical perfection			1
he says that , in the future , we may find the age of plastic surgery rather odd			2
‘ it is a funny time			0
i think we will look back on this time like we do on people using leeches and wonder why we did it , ’ he said			0
‘ i think it is quite crazy			0
i want to document it			0
it is the big story of our era			0
’ @entity103 , pictured , discussed at the @entity101 some of his own research into cosmetic surgery that suggests it emotionally detaches parents and children			1
he is known for portraits of several high - profile people including an infamous piece of president @entity147 made out of cuttings from pornographic magazines			0

studies suggest babies ca **n't** empathise with adults who have nip and tuck
infants apparently can not see emotion when parents have @entity7 injections
this leaves the child often distressed as it ca **n't** get an emotional response
the research has come to the fore after being *highlighted* by a @entity31 artist
@entity103 at the @entity101 said the rise of surgery was ' quite crazy '
