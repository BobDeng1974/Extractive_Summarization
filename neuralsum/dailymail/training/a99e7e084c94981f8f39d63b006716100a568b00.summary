by @entity0 we are in @entity3 's painting studio overlooking @entity5 's @entity4			1
there 's a table full of oil paints , half - finished canvases , watercolours			1
a bronze bust of @entity12			2
@entity3 is not a person who paints in old slacks and a cardigan			1
he 's wearing a navy pin - stripe suit , blue shirt , floral tie and a smile that is part angelic , part cheery cheshire cat			1
his eyes are large and kind , but you feel there is pain behind them			2
@entity3 describes @entity28 as ' one of the greatest jazz singers of all time ' he 's 87 , still singing , still painting , still taking art classes , still headlining concert tours and putting out at least two albums a year			1
his latest , @entity35 , is a collection of his most loved duets			1
they include @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity44			2
poignantly , too , there 's a reprise of his 2011 grammy - winner @entity47 with the talented but tragic @entity28 , her last - ever track , recorded just a few months before her death in july that year			1
they developed an unlikely bond			2
' @entity28 was one of the greatest jazz singers of all time , ' he tells me , gesturing for me to sit with him on his couch			1
' in many ways she achieved what she wanted to do			2
it 's regrettable that she died so young			1
' did she ever talk to him about her problems or her addiction to drugs and alcohol ? there 's another long pause			1
' i wanted her to ... ' he begins			2
' @entity70 , the handsomest man in the world , sorry for name - dropping , suggested before he died ( in 1986 ) that for my 85th birthday i should play the @entity74			1
' when he reached his 80s , @entity3 began making plans for the @entity74 show and wanted @entity28 to play there with him			1
' i was so sad she died before i had the chance to ask her , ' he says			2
@entity3 with the singing legend , @entity39 who features on his new duets album they were strangely kindred spirits			1
in the 70s when his kind of jazz standard style seemed old - fashioned and was muted by the excesses of rock , @entity3 himself smoked pot and did cocaine			1
you ca n't imagine him not talking about such things with @entity28			2
he 's said in the past , ' when you get into drugs you hide from the public			1
i got caught up in it			2
when the @entity101 and @entity102 were assassinated in the 1960s , our country took a terrible turn			2
' now he explains , ' i was n't doing a huge amount			1
i was smoking pot and doing a little bit of cocaine			1
people get addicted and everything changes for the worse			1
' in fact he became seriously ill from a cocaine overdose in 1979 when he had to be revived in the bath by his second wife @entity117			1
he managed to avoid rehab , but then came a seminal moment			2
' the manager of ( comedian ) @entity122 told me he sinned against his talent with his drug habit			2
that sentence changed my life			2
i 've been given this gift			2
i know how to sing and perform			2
i 'm sinning against this gift and i thought , " i am not going to do that any more " , and i just stopped			2
i had to , because i thought i was going to lose everything			2
it was said at the right moment , at the right time			0
' no other help ? ' no , just like that			0
' he confides that he had an addictive personality , but the only thing he 's hooked on now is chocolate			1
' but if you eat it in moderation , you 're not going to get into trouble			0
it 's good to take care of yourself			1
it took me years to realise that , but now i 'm content			0
i do n't have to worry about what i 'm doing			0
i 'm doing so much better			0
i exercise three times a week with a trainer			0
' @entity3 and @entity42 pose backstage after her show at @entity151 in @entity5 , april , 2014 it seems everybody wants to sing with him and no one - in a career spanning over 60 years - seems to have had a bad word to say about him			1
he seems to have made no enemies			0
his smile turns into a grin			0
' i try to be a good person , you know			0
' how has he made all these unlikely duets - others in his career include @entity164 , @entity165 , @entity166 and @entity167 - come about ? ' we like to go to where they live so they feel comfortable , rather than have them come to us			1
@entity173 , @entity174 , wherever			0
' he married his third wife , @entity176 , 35 years his junior , in 2007			0
' it was her father who introduced us			0
we hit it off from the beginning			0
we worked together establishing my schools for the performing arts			0
' there are now 17 of them , named after his late friend @entity39 , with whom he sings @entity5 on his album			1
@entity3 's career catapulted in the 50s after @entity39 stated in a magazine , ' for my money , @entity3 is the best singer in the world			1
' ' @entity39 's fans became interested in me and i sold out all over the world			1
he did change my career			0
i owe him so much			0
' duetting with @entity42 , with whom he sings @entity201 on the album , has raised as many eyebrows as @entity28			1
' everyone expects @entity42 to be a bit strange			0
not at all , she 's very intelligent and a great singer			1
she 's one of the most talented people i 've ever met			1
she knows how to be absolutely unpredictable			0
' @entity3 has played for more presidents than any other living musician			1
' president @entity211 was the first president i felt i did n't have to stand to attention for			0
he knows a lot about music			0
i really like president @entity216			0
he 's working hard to stop all wars			1
i sung for him with @entity41			0
' music and painting were always his great loves			0
he sold his first painting to @entity70			0
' it was a scene in the @entity223			0
he liked it because the view from his window in the @entity227 looked very similar to the painting			0
' in his studio , he currently has several paintings in progress			0
a couple of portraits of women - local art students who pose as models			0
and up on the easel there 's a large scene of @entity4 , impressionistic happy colours			1
' @entity39 's fans became interested in me and i sold out all over the world			1
he did change my career			0
i owe him so much			0
' ' i paint whenever i can			0
if i do n't i miss it , and if you keep doing something , it becomes effortless			0
it 's not a struggle to do the few things i love			1
i like to say i 've never worked a day in my life , because i 'm doing the things i love			1
' @entity3 is also a civil rights champion , which goes back to when he served in @entity254 he was shocked by the racism he encountered			1
he was reprimanded for bringing a black friend to a dinner at his hotel even though he was told he could bring any guest he wanted			0
' my captain called me out , cut off my corporal stripes , threw them to the ground and put me on grave duty			0
i had to pick up dead bodies to register them			0
that incident affected my whole being			0
' he says he 's never had to choose between his music and his art. ' when i was growing up , my @entity274 @entity273 family , all the aunts and uncles , would come over every sunday to help my mum out because my father was ill for a long time before he died when i was ten			1
my mother @entity277 was a seamstress and worked day and night for a penny a dress to put food on the table for three children			2
' when the relatives came over i would sing for them and also show them my art. everyone told me i painted and sang very well and i remember clearly saying this is who i am			0
i had a very strong passion and to this day i still have that passion and that is still who i am , and i 'm still learning			2
