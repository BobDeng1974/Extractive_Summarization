the fiancee of @entity2 governor @entity1 has admitted that she violated the law when she married an immigrant seeking to retain residency in the @entity6			1
@entity7 says she was paid around $ 5,000 for the 1997 marriage to @entity10 immigrant @entity9			1
she also says she was ' associating with the wrong people and struggling to put herself through college and regrets her actions ' at the time			2
she says she was ' associating with the wrong people and struggling to put herself through college and regrets her actions ' at the time @entity7 , 47 , also admitted she did never told the governor about the marriage			1
the marriage , her third , was uncovered when @entity29 newspaper began asking questions this week			1
talking it out : @entity7 , 47 , ( pictured with her husband ) also admitted she did never told the governor about the marriage she had previously claimed to have only been married twice			1
the marriage took place on july 19 , 1997 in @entity37 when @entity7 was 29 - years - old and the couple filed for divorce in 2001			1
gov. @entity1 , a @entity40 and political friend of president @entity41 , is seeking a fourth term as governor next month , this as he completes his unprecedented third term in the state 's highest office			1
it is still not certain how this news may effect his run for reelection			2
bad timing : gov. @entity1 ( above with president @entity41 ) was unaware of the marriage according to @entity7 , and hit with the news as he is seeks reelection for his fourth term ' if the polls come out a week from now or 10 days from now and show nothing has happened , that tells me this was water off a duck 's back for voters			1
they did n't care , ' said @entity65 12 political analyst @entity64			2
' on the other hand , 10 days from now if we see a 12 or 14 point lead down to a 5 point race , clearly it 's been damaging			2
' gov. @entity1 met @entity7 in 2002 , and the two became engaged earlier this year			1
seventeen years ago i made a serious mistake by committing an illegal act when i married a person so that he could retain residency in the @entity6			1
it was a marriage of convenience			1
he needed help and i needed financial support			2
we were both living in @entity37			2
i was attending @entity82 , and we were introduced by mutual acquaintances			2
this was a difficult and unstable period in my life			2
i want to be clear today - i was associating with the wrong people			0
i was struggling to put myself through college and was offered money in exchange for marrying a young person who had a chance to get a college degree himself if he were able to remain in the @entity6			0
we met only a handful of times			0
i have not had any contact with him since the divorce finalized in 2002			0
it was wrong then and it is wrong now and i am here today to accept the consequences , some of which will be life changing			0
and i can not predict what direction this will go			0
in the few years after this bad decision i completed my degree , got my feet underneath me and established my home and career in @entity2			1
i became an active and engaged civic volunteer , community member and i became active politically			0
my decision to marry illegally felt very , very distant and far removed from the life i was building			2
i was ashamed and embarrassed			0
therefore i did not share this information even with @entity1 once we met and started dating			1
this is the most painful part for me			0
@entity1 deserved to know the history of the person he was forming a relationship with			1
the fact that i did not disclose this to him meant that he has learned about this in the most public and unpleasant way			0
this is my greatest sorrow in this difficult situation			0
i apologize deeply for my actions and omissions , first and foremost to @entity1 , the person i love and respect above all others			1
i also apologize to my friends , family and colleagues who have trusted and supported me			0
and to @entity137 , i deeply regret not being right up front about the fact that i had made a serious mistake			0
i owe you all an apology			0
the work that i do on behalf of our environment and trying to make people 's lives better is incredibly important to me -- it 's the focal point of my life			0
i will continue to do my best in that arena going forward			0
but for the time being , there are more important issues			0
i need to take some personal time to reflect and address this difficult situation and to focus on my relationship with @entity1			1
