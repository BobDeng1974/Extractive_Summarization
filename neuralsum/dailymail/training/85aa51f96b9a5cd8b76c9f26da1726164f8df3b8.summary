@entity0 insists @entity1 will stay at @entity2 after resisting repeated attempts by other clubs to take him on loan			1
@entity1 was a star of @entity8 's @entity7 campaign but is only on the fringe of the @entity11 ' first team with just one substitute appearance so far this season			1
with @entity14 sidelined because of a broken tibia until january , @entity0 has asked @entity16 to operate as the lone striker with the inexperienced @entity18 also filling in			1
' we 've had lots of enquiries and turned them down			0
there have been plenty of clubs interested , but i do n't know how many , ' @entity11 boss @entity0 said			1
' once i say to my assistant he wo n't go out on loan , even if people ask about him , my assistant does n't even tell me			0
when i say no it 's no. ' he 's definitely a target and a player who is wanted by many clubs			2
' speculation over whether @entity2 will sign a new top - level striker before monday 's transfer deadline has dominated the build - up to their @entity56 trip to @entity57 on sunday			2
form : @entity1 shone during the @entity7 for @entity8 and has been the subject of ' lots of enquiries ' waiting his turn : @entity1 has appeared just once off the bench so far in this @entity56 season @entity0 has not ruled out acquiring a new forward to replace @entity14 , but has stressed it is not essential for the @entity11 to be title contenders and will only buy who he believes is the right fit			1
in contrast , @entity69 have engaged in a late flurry of business by signing @entity73 with the arrival of @entity75 imminent			2
@entity69 have reacted to a dismal start to the season , but @entity0 has little sympathy with his old rivals and refuses to discuss a succession plan at @entity2 in light of the slump at @entity83 following sir @entity85 's departure			1
' let 's be a little patient because @entity69 have just started the season , ' @entity0 said			1
' they will come back and i do n't worry too much for them because they have made us suffer enough in the past			0
competition : @entity1 will be competing with @entity95 ( left ) and @entity16 ( right ) to play upfront ' if you look at the names they have in their squad , once it works out they will be a force again in the @entity56			2
' when asked about how best to introduce his own successor , @entity0 replied : ' the ideal world exists only in the imagination of the human being			2
' once you leave a club you want it to go as well as possible			0
' that 's what @entity85 wanted as well			0
if it 's not working as well as expected , then it 's not @entity85 's fault			0
' you do well as long as you can			0
it 's competition and cyclical as well			0
my only focus is to win the next game			0
' no sympathy : @entity0 does not feel sorry for @entity69 , who have spent big after a terrible start			1
