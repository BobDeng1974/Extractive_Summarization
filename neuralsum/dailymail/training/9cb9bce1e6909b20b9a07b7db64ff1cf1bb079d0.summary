my initial impression of @entity2 ? hot			1
i first visited in 1982 – when @entity3 played their first test match against @entity2 in @entity5			1
then we went and played in @entity7 , in the central province , and it has become one of my favourite places in the whole country			1
it ’s home to the @entity14 ( @entity15 ) , and is the most important spot for @entity2 ’s @entity18 community			1
the whole town is steeped in history			2
it ’s always been one of the country ’s major trading places , and there are beautiful temples and tea plantations			2
it must be part of your itinerary			2
a family favourite : @entity33 has spent time with his grandchildren in @entity2 - and has long found @entity7 ( right ) , where the @entity14 is an important @entity18 landmark - to be one of its greatest cities i only really started to fall in love with the country on coming back to commentate			1
as a player we were never in one place long enough			2
i visited the south at the start of 2004 , just after the tsunami			1
it was horrendous , with bodies still being pulled from the rubble			2
since then , @entity52 ( i ’m an ambassador for the organisation ) has worked with the @entity2 - based @entity54 and built the @entity55 in @entity56 , an area which was devastated by the huge wave			1
there ’s a brand new school , a cricket oval and an @entity63 - sized pool			1
the pool was paid for by rock singer @entity64 , who offered to help fund the sports complex after reading about the destruction wreaked by the tsunami , and locals have named it the @entity70 in his honour			0
it ’s hard to believe that when i first visited , the railway line - and a train - were 400 yards away in a coconut tree			1
it was this project which inspired me to undertake last year ’s sponsored walk			0
i managed 160 miles , from the north to the south of the island , in eight days			0
the aim was to raise money and mirror what ’s been done in the south - because the north was devastated by the civil war and has suffered terribly			0
the north has so much to offer - it ’s @entity2 ’s next booming tourism centre			1
the main draw are the beaches – they ’re sensational			0
there are new hotels and railways being built and the airport at @entity94 , the capital city of the northern province , is being renovated			0
it should establish itself within five years			0
@entity97 - the capital of the north central province - and @entity100 , which is the birthplace of @entity102 in @entity2 , have beautiful stupas and temples which put @entity105 to shame - well , almost			1
they are within what ’s known as @entity2 ’s cultural triangle			1
splendid : the south coast of @entity2 has glorious beaches - and has recovered from the tsunami of 2004 this area ’s most spectacular landmark is the @entity115 rock fortress - an enormous , 200 - metre - high lump of stone			1
in 480 ad , a @entity2 king built his castle atop the rock			1
it ’s a @entity122 and @entity2 call it the eighth wonder of the world			1
i climbed it on my first cricket tour and was amazed			1
so much that , while taking a photo , i accidentally knocked over the bottle of water i ’d diligently carried to the top			0
i remember watching in horror as it rolled over the edge and tumbled out of sight			0
i ’ve visited @entity2 with my family several times			1
some of the most memorable trips have been with my wife and the grandchildren			1
it ’s incredibly child - friendly - as child - friendly as destinations like @entity145 or the @entity146			0
we wanted to show the grandchildren that life is n’t easy , that terrible things happen but you have to pick yourself up , dust yourself off and carry on			2
the @entity2 are the best example of this - they ’re always smiling and there ’s no bitterness about the unfair hand they ’ve been dealt , with the civil war and tsunami			1
they are the reason my wife @entity164 and i keep returning			0
we ’ve spent a lot of time in the capital , @entity5 , which is a fantastic , progressive city , with great hotels and restaurants			2
we like @entity170 , the restaurant at the @entity171 , where you choose your seafood from a huge display and the chefs cook it however you want			0
the grandchildren loved it - they would compete to find the biggest fish			2
other great restaurants in the capital are the @entity181 , which is owned by @entity2 cricketers @entity183 and @entity184 , and the @entity186 restaurant , which blends @entity2 and @entity188 cuisine			1
i ’ve probably spent most time in the south , in coastal towns like @entity191 and @entity192			2
in @entity192 , we rented a villa and just chill out - i love watching the stilt fishermen balancing on their poles			0
inviting : @entity7 , at the very heart of this tropical island , is @entity2 at its most intriguing i ’ve spent hours walking around @entity191 fort , which is a walled city			1
the locals have incredible stories to tell about the day the tsunami hit - how they could see the wave coming and ran inside the fort , emerging hours later to find the rest of the city in ruins			0
the fort was built by the @entity207 in the 14th century and it split the wave and saved thousands of lives			0
nobody inside died - you can walk around inside and see these old shops and restaurants which were n’t even affected			0
the grandchildren also adored @entity192 , where they fished , rode in tuk - tuks , played on the beaches and spotted turtles			2
one day was spent just fishing on the beach			1
one of my grandchildren , @entity220 , is extremely competitive - he simply has to beat his younger sister at everything			2
@entity220 had spent all day waiting for a bite			0
he put down the rod while he nipped to the loo and his sister @entity226 picked up the rod and caught a fish within seconds			0
my advice for anyone considering a visit to @entity2 ? do it			1
it is all there to be explored			0
tourism on the south coast is well - established			0
the east and west coasts are becoming more established , and the north will soon be the next big tourism destination			0
what ’s more , you do n’t have to walk everywhere - like i did			0
@entity243 ( @entity244 , 020 8538 2000 ) flies daily ( apart from saturdays and sundays , when there are two flights a day ) to @entity5 from @entity247			0

he has a particular fondness for @entity7 , with its famous @entity18 temple
