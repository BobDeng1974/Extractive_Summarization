by @entity0 @entity1 : 04:04 est , 23 december 2013 @entity2 : 05:01 est , 23 december 2013 @entity3 has one and so does @entity5 , but if you 're contemplating giving someone onesie for @entity10 , it might be time to think again			1
according to a new survey , the all - in - one is the present that the majority of us would least like to find under the tree come wednesday			0
over a third said they would n't be happy to unwrap one - even a luxury version such as @entity19 's Â £ 199 cashmere offering			0
do n't do it ! unlike the members of @entity25 , most of us wo n't be pleased to find a onesie under the tree no thanks ! even @entity19 's Â £ 199 cashmere onesie could prove unpopular if added to the present pile but onesies were n't the only ones to appear at the top of the @entity10 gift blacklist			1
close behind all - in - ones were celebrity weight loss dvds , which 32 per cent said they would n't want to find under the tree			2
in third place were novelty @entity10 jumpers , hand - knitted or otherwise , which were chosen by 12 per cent of those asked			1
also unpopular were socks of any kind and celebrity cook books			2
but for those hoping to avoid onesies and celebrity workout dvds are likely to be disappointed : two thirds of us receive at least one gift we do n't want every @entity10 , according to the research by @entity52 shops			1
grandparents are the worst gift givers , with 12 per cent handing over stuff which is not wanted			0
they are followed by mothers , also with 12 per cent of the vote , and spouses who were nominated by seven per cent of those quizzed by the charity			0
bad idea : celebrity fitness dvds and cook books also proved to be unpopular choices but some good can come out of recieving a dodgy @entity10 gift , with the @entity52 urging people to donate unwanted presents to their shops to help fund life - saving research			1
commenting on the survey , @entity52 retail director @entity72 said : ' people often receive perfectly good gifts that are just not to their taste or are the wrong size			0
or they even get two of the same thing			0
' we encourage them to donate these items to @entity52 shops so unwanted @entity10 gifts can help in the fight against heart disease			2

more than a third of people said they did n't want a onesie
celebrity fitness dvds were almost as unpopular and came second
third place was taken by novelty @entity10 jumpers with socks in *fourth*
