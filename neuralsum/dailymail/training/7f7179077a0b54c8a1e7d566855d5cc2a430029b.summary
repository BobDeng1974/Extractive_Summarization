@entity1 nuns are a ' dying breed ' an in - depth @entity4 study has confirmed , prompting concern within the religious community			1
the results of a three - year - long investigation released in @entity9 on tuesday , told how the current workforce stands at 50,000 compared to 175,000 in the mid-sixties			1
and on top of that , the average age of @entity14 sisters is mid-to late 70 , with few young women stepping in to replace them			1
dwindling numbers : a @entity4 report has confirmed fears among the religious community that nuns in the @entity1 are a ' dying breed ' - here two sisters leave the @entity4 after the findings were announced tuesday @entity4 researchers sent questionnaires and conducted ' sister - to - sister ' dialogues at 341 catholic institutions across the @entity1 between 2009 and 2012			1
among the topics of focus were numbers and mission , prayer schedules , living arrangements , financial assets and property			0
' many sisters expressed great concern			0
for the continuation of their charism and mission , because of the numerical decline in their membership , ' the report on the @entity40 said			0
the paper is the result of an investigation launched after some @entity4 officials and @entity1 bishops voiced concerns over the nuns			1
one official suggested they had been infiltrated by ' radical feminism '			0
the inquiry , begun during the papacy of former pope @entity60			0
however , tuesday 's overwhelmingly positive 12 - page report was cheered by the sisters themselves , dozens of whom swarmed the news conference announcing the results in a rare moment of women outnumbering men at the @entity4			1
sister @entity70 , who currently heads the @entity71 , acknowledged that the investigation was initially met with apprehension and distrust , particularly among elderly sisters who ' felt that their whole lives had been judged and found wanting			2
' but she said the results showed that the @entity4 had listened and heard what the sisters had to say			2
' there is an encouraging and realistic tone in this report , ' she told the news conference			2
' challenges are understood , but it is not a document of blame , or of simplistic solutions			0
one can read the text and feel appreciated and trusted to carry on			0
' asked if the change in tone from the start of the process to the end was a reflection of @entity98 ' leadership , @entity70 said ' i 'm willing to give him all sorts of credit			0
' ' i do n't know how to assess entirely his influence in all of this , but he 's been a great encouragement and hope to a lot of us , ' she said			0
the @entity4 officials had suggested some nuns did not fully espouse @entity113 teachings against abortion and homosexuality and that some had become too involved in political issues			0
on a good note : the @entity4 went out of its way to mend fences with @entity1 religious sisters , thanking them for their selfless work caring for the poor , gently suggesting ways to survive amid a decline in numbers but tuesday 's report made no reference to any specific criticism and did not dwell on the controversy over the investigation			1
it said @entity1 orders of nuns ' should carefully review their spiritual practices and ministry to assure that these are in harmony with @entity14 teaching ' and urged them not to ' displace @entity142 ' while going about their social work			1
but it also praised them for ' selflessly tending to the spiritual , moral , educational , physical and social needs of countless individuals , especially the poor and marginalized '			0
the report acknowledged that a number of nuns had expressed the need for greater recognition of the role nuns play in the @entity113 and felt women should have more input into decisions that affect them			2
@entity98 , who met a delegation of @entity1 nuns on tuesday , has promised to appoint women to decision - making roles in the @entity4			1
the @entity164 , a @entity1 group which organized demonstrations to defend the nuns , said the investigation had been a waste of time			2
' ( the nuns ) had to divert precious resources away from ministries to the marginalized just so @entity9 could discover what @entity14 have known all along : @entity1 women religious are among the most inspiring and faithful of @entity14 , ' it said .			1
