scaremongering : @entity0 claimed parents would find it harder to stop their children being taken into care as a result of the cuts but mrs @entity0 , a @entity56 , warned it was triggering a ‘ real crisis ’			1
she told @entity58 : ‘ our criminal system does n’t work unless each side is properly represented			0
‘ and the legal aid cuts , which could be as much as 30 per cent at the moment , mean it ’s going to be more and more difficult for people where the state is taking you to court , whether it ’s about a criminal offence or perhaps the state its taking your child into care , if you do n’t get proper representation then you ’re going to be in trouble defending yourself			1
’ however , the government hit back , insisting legal aid would still be available to cases involving children			1
a spokesman for the @entity16 said : ‘ our reforms present no change to the current system where anyone charged with a crime , or subject to criminal investigation , is provided with a qualified lawyer through legal aid			1
‘ we are only proposing average 6 per cent or 2 per cent changes to most barristers ’ fees			2
after our reforms we will still be spending around £ 1.5 billion a year , meaning it will still be one of the most generous legal aid systems in the world			0
‘ as for claiming children will be taken into care without a lawyer being involved , that is just irresponsible scaremongering			1
‘ we have specifically ensured legal aid is , and will remain , available for these types of cases			2

' at the @entity116 , only five out of 18 of the criminal courts were sitting today			0

@entity157 , chairman of the @entity158 ( @entity158 ) , said : ‘ if these cuts are not addressed , then the @entity160 justice system , which is held in such high esteem around the world , will cease to exist as we know it and the @entity160 public can no longer expect true justice to be delivered			2
‘ it is simply expected that the criminal bar will accept cuts unparalleled in any other sector of the wider community			0
‘ @entity173 can not and will not accept these unnecessary and crippling cuts and will continue to fiercely oppose them at every opportunity until our reasonable requests have been met with the appropriate levels of consideration			0
’ barristers refused to attend court for the first time in january , causing widespread disruption to criminal justice			0

it is the second time that barristers have staged a walk out on the cuts , after the first in january the protesters were joined by a woman dressed as the ' @entity206 ' , from the dome of the @entity116 , holding a sword and the scales of justice it is claimed that as a result of the changes junior barristers face rates as low as £ 20 a day the @entity16 has previously said it is vital to scale back ' one of the most expensive ' legal aid schemes in the world and insisted it will remain ' very generous ' even after the changes			1
but the @entity158 said many junior barristers face rates as low as £ 20 a day , once the hours of preparation , time in court and chambers ’ fees are factored in , as well as receiving no holiday pay , no pension provision and no sickness or maternity benefits .			0
