by @entity0 recently , i tried to book my 11 - year - old daughter @entity2 on the @entity3 to @entity4			1
she ’s off for a week - long trip to stay with a family friend who ’s studying at college there and could n’t be more excited			2
our friend @entity9 would have met her at the @entity11 , and , while she speaks only a little @entity12 , if @entity2 had run into any problems she could always have called me on her mobile			0
but her plans were thrown into jeopardy when @entity3 flatly refused to let me buy her a ticket			1
apparently , she ’s too young , by nearly a year			2
i tried to remonstrate with the manager			0
‘ she ’s been taking trains on her own for years , ’ i told her			2
‘ not safely , ’ she retorted			0
and she ’s not the only person who seems to think i ’m irresponsible to let my daughter travel abroad alone			1
i know other parents insist that , by fostering @entity21 ’s independence and encouraging her to travel to the @entity38 on her own , i ’m flinging her in the path of every paedophile in @entity41			1
this was n’t the first time we ’d bundled @entity21 off to a foreign land on her own			1
foreign land : @entity47 , now 11 , travelled to @entity48 on her own @entity3 may insist we should mollycoddle youngsters , but @entity51 takes a far more sensible approach			1
@entity21 has already flown to @entity48 in @entity12			1
and not only was she alone , she was just nine at the time			0
what ’s more , she did n’t even have a mobile telephone — and we were comfortable that she only used the landline to ring home once or twice a week			2
she neither knew the @entity12 exchange family she was going to stay with , nor could she speak a word of the language			0
however , she was keen to go and my husband and i agreed that it would be good for her			0
she flew with @entity51 , who have a @entity66 service for unaccompanied children , and we booked a spare seat for her harp			1
the @entity12 exchange family picked her up from the airport and she had a wonderful holiday			0
when i told the @entity3 manager that @entity21 frequently travels by train on her own , i sensed she was considering whether to report me to the police — and perhaps you are too			1
terrible mother ? many have condemned @entity0 after all , when i wrote about this subject for @entity82 earlier this week , some of the readers left me in no doubt they thought i was crazy			1
‘ what a terrible mother , ’ was the gist of many of the kinder comments			0
‘ a disaster waiting to happen , ’ declared one man , while another urged : ‘ take her kids off her			0
’ if they only knew what else i and my husband have let our five children do on their own , no doubt they ’d be even more horrified			2
all our children — @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 and @entity21 — have been young adventurers			1
i believe letting children be independent could actually make them safer in the long run			2
it ’s been a deliberate policy to let them travel alone from as young as possible — not because i want to save time for me , but to give them reserves of confidence and chutzpah that would carry them into successful and interesting futures			2
and , before you say this must be for my own convenience , i ’ll have you know that i spent two terms teaching my eldest daughter @entity99 how to bicycle the two miles to senior school aged 11 and the same amount of time teaching @entity21 to walk to school			1
how much easier would it have been to accept my father ’s kind offer to drive her there every day for us ! it ’s simply nonsense to suggest i ’m endangering my children by doing this			1
in fact , i ’d have done it sooner if i ’d been able			0
all of us in the family wanted @entity21 to walk to school ( all of 20 yards away , watched by us from the doorstep ) when she was five , but the school insisted we accompany her			1
that ’s why , when we moved from @entity141 to @entity142 a year later , i made it clear to the new headmistress that @entity21 would be walking in on her own			1
@entity145 : ' i like the fact that my parents trust me			1
it also prepares your child for adulthood ' says @entity21 it was less than a mile , mostly through a pedestrianised shopping centre and finishing along a traffic - free path by the river			1
when my own father expressed mild surprise , i pointed out that he had crossed town alone to school from the tender age of seven			0
i walked to school alone aged five			2
all the evidence shows that no more children are snatched off the streets by paedophiles now than 50 years ago			2
all that has changed is traffic			0
and , critically , our perception of danger			0
extraordinarily , other parents complained to the headteacher — @entity21 was n’t safe they said , perhaps thinking she might fall in the river , be run over , raped or abducted , but the head backed up our right to do what we thought best , despite the criticism			1
the next year , @entity21 went on the bus to visit her sister @entity100 in @entity181			1
we put her on at one end , alerted the driver to her presence , and @entity100 met her at the other			0
she also visited @entity99 in @entity186 , who would do the same at @entity188 , the @entity190 manager having upgraded @entity21 to @entity191 to keep an eye on her			1
young adventurers : @entity2 prepare some homemade treats in the kitchen with her @entity12 exchange family so when she was offered the opportunity to try out for a music scholarship and a choristership at @entity200 200 miles away , 18 months ago , she went			0
she was successful in her endeavours and started last september without me or her father ever having visited the place			0
nowadays , she capably manages railway stations and journey changes she has never encountered before			0
if things are n’t running to schedule , she has no qualms about borrowing the train manager ’s telephone ( she seldom remembers to charge hers ) to alert us or her sisters to her whereabouts			1
some people may be horrified that she ’ll happily walk up to a strange man and talk to him , but i think it ’s brilliant she ’s got the confidence to be able to do so — choosing a man in uniform because she knows he ’s there to help her			2
‘ i like the fact that my parents trust me , ’ she said recently			1
‘ it prepares you for adulthood			0
’ time to grow up : @entity0 believes the idea of children travelling alone is more scary for the adult indeed it does			1
our children — who , except for @entity21 , are now in their twenties — have been all over the world without us , including @entity235 , the @entity237 @entity236 and @entity238			1
being allowed to travel alone has taught them confidence , independence and risk management			0
what ’s more , statistics show a child is more likely to be killed inside a car than out			2
and cyclists — such as my children and i — live longer because it makes for a healthier lifestyle			2
the reason more parents do not allow their children to travel alone may be more about them than the safety of their offspring			1
we want to feel we are doing everything to keep our children safe , that we have a vital role and that they need us			0
but by doing this , we can actually keep them unnaturally immature and prevent them learning to be safe for themselves			0
that ’s why i believe my way could actually be safest			0
it just feels more scary for the adult			0
waving your six - year - old child goodbye as she walks to school on her own for the first time is terrifying			0
much easier to get in the car			0
but that first day has to come sooner or later and , provided it is done responsibly and sensibly , sooner can really be better			0
maybe it ’s time for us adults to grow up and start acting in a way that ’s best for our children rather than for ourselves .			2

when @entity0 tried to buy her daughter @entity21 a train ticket to @entity4 , @entity3 refused because she was travelling alone
aged just nine , @entity21 *previously* flew to @entity48 *unsupervised*
other parents have condemned @entity0 *'s* actions as irresponsible
but @entity0 says the world is not as dangerous as we perceive it to be
@entity21 says she is glad her parents trust her so much
@entity0 ’s book @entity294 : trust your *instincts* and enjoy your children , is *published* by @entity299 .
