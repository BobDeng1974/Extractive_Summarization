by @entity0 published : 03:57 est , 24 february 2014 @entity2 : 06:51 est , 24 february 2014 silence : many of @entity6 's victims did not speak out because they thought they would n't be believed many victims of @entity6 were ignored or even laughed at when they told friends and relatives they had been sexually abused , a report revealed today			1
some were told they were ' lucky someone like @entity6 had paid them attention ' , according to findings compiled by the @entity15			1
and other victims - some aged as young as eight at the time of the @entity20 's ' sickening crimes ' - never told anyone about their suffering because they assumed they would never be believed			1
many of the 26 men and women interviewed for the report have still not confided in family or friends about their experiences , the charity said			1
one victim said : ' everyone found it hilarious so i eventually just stopped talking about it			1
' @entity6 's crimes came to light in a tv documentary broadcast a year after he died in october 2011 , at the age of 84			0
the revelations about the former presenter of @entity42 and @entity43 'll fix it prompted hundreds of victims to come forward with claims that they were attacked			0
according to today 's report , would they actually have believed me ? , some of the victims told hospital workers and one went to the police , but no action was ever taken			1
the 26 victims - chosen because they were the only ones willing to participate in the @entity15 's focus groups - were mostly children at the time of the abuse , and ranged in age between eight and 26			1
the @entity15 said the research , which was commissioned by @entity61 in a bid to improve the way that police deal with abuse allegations , highlighted the ' devastating scars ' that victims had suffered			1
some turned to drink and drugs to cope , while others have suffered mental illness or contemplated suicide			1
@entity73 , the @entity15 's director of national services , said : ' the responses these victims received when they first revealed @entity6 's sickening crimes makes heart - rending reading			1
' they were ignored , dismissed , not believed , laughed at and , astonishingly , told in some cases they should feel lucky he had paid them attention			0
' half a century on , the world finally discovered just how dreadful his crimes were - something these men and women had known all that time but felt powerless to do anything about			0
' the anger , frustration and sheer helplessness of the situation obviously damaged their lives in various ways			0
but they showed true courage in coming forward once more to talk about their experiences and hopefully they can now start to put the terrible trauma behind them			0
' abuse : @entity6 used his fame and reputation to attack children with impunity , a report has found a report released last year found that a total of 450 people had claimed that they were abused by @entity6 , with three quarters of the alleged victims being children			1
many of his attacks were carried out on @entity120 premises as he was presenting tv and radio programmes , with others taking place in schools or hospitals while he was supposedly carrying out charitable activities			0
today 's new report reveals how victims are able to recall precise details about the abuse , such as @entity6 's scent or the last words he said to them			1
some are still suffering from the emotional trauma caused by the abuse - when @entity6 's sex crimes became public knowledge at the end of 2012 , some victims suffered flashbacks and felt physically sick when they saw pictures of him			2
however , the extensive media coverage also encouraged them to come forward and report the crimes , the @entity15 said			1
three - quarters of victims interviewed did not realise as children that they had been sexually abused by the late @entity20 , the report found			1
some of those interviewed said they were aware that something wrong was happening but felt helpless , ashamed or intimidated by @entity6 's fame , with some believing the abuse had to be reported by an adult			2
' i never thought i could go to the police on my own , ' one victim said			0
' children 's minds work completely differently , do n't they ? ' power : some victims were told they were ' lucky ' to be chosen by such a big star as @entity6 some said they had initially blamed themselves , assuming they must have done something wrong , or ' been naughty '			2
during the 1960s and 1970s , many did not understand what had happened to them - the issue of sex abuse was so hidden from mainstream society that the victims had never even heard the word ' paedophile '			2
the report said : ' some remembered feeling that an elder - particularly a celebrity like @entity6 - must know better than they did			0
' there were also cases where participants also remembered feeling conflicted , and wondering if they should feel flattered or grateful that he had " chosen them "			0
' a key reason for not reporting the abuse was an ' overwhelming belief ' from victims that they would not have been believed at the time , the @entity15 said			1
' @entity6 was a powerful and influential adult , who was seen as a " charitable , good guy " raising a lot of money for charity , ' the report said			0
' this led to feelings of hopelessness and inferiority in his victims , who felt there was no way that their word would have been believed over his			2
' honoured : @entity6 was knighted in 1990 and received a host of other honours in his lifetime according to the report , victims had ' largely positive experiences ' when they finally went to the police after @entity208 launched @entity209 in the wake of the tv expos√© about @entity6			2
but they wanted to see improvements , including new ways to report sexual abuse and additional specialist training for officers investigating allegations			0
and one complained that when reporting the crime to police an officer said , ' i think i would have pushed him off , ' leading to the victim once again feeling uncertain about exactly what had happened			0
lawyer @entity224 of @entity225 , who represents more than 140 @entity227 victims , said : ' we welcome the @entity15 's report into the disgusting and horrific crimes of @entity6 which many of the victims we represent helped produce			1
' it is hugely significant that the victims unanimously call for professionals who work with children and the vulnerable to have an obligation to report abuse they become aware of			2
it is frankly shocking this is not already law			0
' mandatory reporting of abuse , as recommended in this @entity15 report , would ensure the silence that @entity6 and predators like him shrouded themselves in will never be allowed to happen again			1
' @entity247 of @entity61 said : ' i am deeply grateful to the victims who contributed to this powerful and moving report			2
it vividly portrays the pain and anguish suffered by @entity6 's victims , which was often made worse by the way they were treated			0
' we owe it to them to make sure that the police service responds positively and ensures victims are supported , listened to and treated with compassion			0
' crime prevention minister @entity263 said : ' it is encouraging to hear that these victims felt the response from police was largely supportive			0
' while we can never right the horrific wrongs committed against these people , we must ensure we do all we can to protect the most vulnerable in our society from becoming victims again in the future			0

many victims have still not told friends and relatives that they were abused
those who confided in others were ignored or *mocked* , @entity15 report says
' everyone found it hilarious so i stopped talking about it , ' one victim said
decades later some victims have turned to drink and drugs to cope
they say they did not understand what was happening and felt @entity294 ' must have known better than them '
