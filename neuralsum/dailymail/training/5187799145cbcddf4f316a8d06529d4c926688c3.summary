by @entity1 reporter last updated at 5:55 pm on 13th september 2011 for those who want to combine the pleasures of caravanning with boating in a single holiday the wait is over			2
an extraordinary £ 13,000 amphibious caravan , dubbed the @entity8 by its @entity10 designer , is set to ensure road and boat trips will never be the same again			1
the floating two - in - one two - bed mobile home has been created by @entity15 , a @entity10 - based industrial designer , to combine the features of an electric power boat and a camping trailer			1
all at sea : the @entity8 is taken for some sea trials , the small outboard engine is visible at the back it took him two years to design , build and test the @entity8 so that he could mass produce and sell it			1
the innovative floating caravan boasts onboard cooking , cleaning , eating and sleeping facilities and can move around on water thanks to an electric motor			1
and its creator said : ' this extends the possibilities of camping and leisure			2
whoever travels with our floating caravan can spend free time on both land and on water			1
perfect towing mate : the @entity8 can be hitched to a car with a trailer like any other caravan perfect spot : with its amphibious capabilities the @entity8 can stay on land or go on water ' it 's just like a holiday should be - up to them and unlimited possibilities			2
' you can settle for the night at the campsite and during the day sunbathe , cruise on the lake or even go fishing for dinner			0
' you can even up sticks and settle on the next island if the camp site is crowded			0
i think the advantages offered by the @entity8 are varied and different for everyone			0
' start your engines : once it hits the waves , the @entity69 is powered by a regular outboard motor bedtime : the interior of the @entity8 has two bench seats which double as beds			1
it also has cooking and washing facilities onboard just like any other caravan or boat so far the @entity8 can only be used in shallow waters but @entity15 is already looking at building vans which can take to deeper waters and even the sea			0
his current design has a clever double hull which means that should the outer shell spring a leak , only the sub-floor will fill with water , ensuring that it remains afloat			0
@entity15 added : ' the body shape of the trailer , or the ' case ' , is made of fibreglass - reinforced plastic and then connected to a water - tight chassis			2
' so the @entity69 is drawn on land as a caravan and when needed can be lowered into the water			1
on the water it can then be moved independently using a motor			0
' in future i hope to develop larger versions of the floating caravans which can run on other waters			2
' the @entity8 is expected to go on sale for camping / boating enthusiasts at the start of next year with a price tag of £ 13,000			1
it is not the first time cars and boats have been combined			0
since the 1920s there have been numerous designs but amphibious craft have been most commonly used for search and rescue purposes and in military applications			0
visitors to @entity118 and @entity119 can even see the sights from amphibious duck vehicles designed to take visitors around on both land and on the river .			0

two - in - one floating mobile home goes on sale early next year
@entity10 designer took two years to build and test the @entity69
