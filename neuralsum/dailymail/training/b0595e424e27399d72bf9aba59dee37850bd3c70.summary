by @entity0 published : 16:54 est , 29 may 2013 updated : 16:54 est , 29 may 2013 of all household chores , loading and emptying the dishwasher is surely one of the most @entity4 when the items being unloaded are delicious home - made vodka infusions , the job becomes more exciting			1
i ’m talking about ‘ dishwasher vodka ’ - a fast - growing internet craze for mixing sweets and chocolate with vodka , and running it through a dishwasher cycle			1
the heat is just enough to combine the contents without losing any alcohol or flavour			1
and while the idea of vodka mixed with pear drops or after eight mints might sound unspeakably naff , enthusiasts insist the results can be astonishing			1
i decided to put it to the test			1
loading up with flavour : @entity0 prepares to wash her cocktail mix sweet sensation : crush sweets and add them to the vodka or , if they 'll fit , put them in whole the good thing about dishwasher vodka is you do n’t need fancy , branded spirits as the sweets provide most of the flavour			1
you ’ll need a one - litre bottle for each flavour you intend to make			1
decant one third and put aside			0
add your ingredient of choice to the bottle - approximately 200g for hard , boiled or jelly sweets and 300g for chocolate			1
screw the bottle tightly shut and wrap in cling film to protect from leakage			0
shake the bottle and place on a shelf in your empty dishwasher			1
do not add any detergent , set to the hottest wash ( 70 degrees in most models ) and prepare to be amazed			0
when the cycle has finished , shake again , allow the infusion to cool and then , if necessary , strain away any residue through a tea strainer			1
your vodka can then be chilled or frozen before serving			1
here ’s how i got on with the ten flavours i tried : this melted perfectly into the vodka to create a dark orange liquid that did not need sieving			1
it smelled delicious.the flavour came through and the infusion was sweet and tasty			1
tip : use a blender on the pear drops to break them down in size , it does n’t matter if they end up being just powder			0
as they are so sweet and sugary , you can get away with using just 150g			0
too big to fit whole into the bottle and too soft to be blended , the @entity86 needed to be hand - chopped			1
just as @entity90 decided life was too short to stuff a mushroom , i must conclude that it ’s also too short to decapitate a @entity86			1
tip : the sweets did n’t melt well , leaving bits behind even after three sieves			1
i used red ones which gave a lovely soft , pink colour but the taste was weak and acidic			0
shake it : mix the ingredients up before putting the bottle in the dishwasher soft and gooey , after eights were easy to squish down into the bottle			1
they melted fairly well but did need to be sieved a couple of times			0
the chocolate mints blended to leave an unappealing brown , sludgy colour , but it smelled fresh and tasted sweet , rich and velvety			1
beware , it ’s very moreish			0
tip : serve over ice as a longer drink			0
these sweets were crushed to a sherbet powder after just a few seconds in the blender and melted brilliantly , leaving an acid yellow cocktail that would be great on a summer ’s day			2
i used @entity126 cakes but any form of liquorice will work			0
this did n’t melt as well as some of the other ingredients , and needed to be sieved several times			0
it also blended to a very un-appetising dirty dishwater shade			0
the flavour was very intense and overpowering - impossible to drink more than one mouthful			2
@entity136 : the @entity138 vodka has a good kick @entity141 treat : the flavour of your @entity143 will determine the cocktail shade the good thing about @entity138 is they ’re small enough to pour straight into the neck of the bottle			1
i used a mix of all the flavours and the infusion melted to a dull , orange colour , a bit like tea			2
the final mixture ended up with a film of scum on top but this was easily drained away			0
the taste , however , more than makes up for it — sweet and zingy with a great kick			0
tip : use one flavour only for a vivid shade			2
green and yellow work well			0
to create a striking colour i used just green gums and cut them into small pieces			2
the gums melted reasonably well but needed to be strained to remove some residue			2
the colour was amazing and the smell was strong , but the taste was a little underwhelming and syrupy			0
unlike their chunkier @entity86 cousins , @entity178 fit easily down the neck of a vodka bottle			1
they melted well , leaving some jelly at the bottom of the bottle			0
if using a mixed pack the result is a very attractive tangerine shade			0
the vodka tasted sweet and mellow and smelled good too			2
tip : works best as a shot			0
caramel heaven : the @entity195 's @entity194 flavour is tasty cheers : @entity0 said the result is worth the effort these needed to be whizzed and broken down in a blender , but then they dissolved very well with no need to sieve afterwards			2
the resulting colour is a lovely ‘ tequila sunrise ’ shade which , when transferred to a glass , looks like a professional cocktail with a tangy and refreshing flavour			2
tip : as with @entity211 , these are sweet enough to get away with 150 grams			0
@entity213 's originals make sure you buy the original hard toffee			0
break into smaller pieces in a blender or with the end of a rolling pin			0
the @entity195 ’s originals were the best dissolvers overall , and the smell when you unscrew the bottle is exquisite			0
the vodka is creamy , packed full of caramel flavour without being sickly sweet			1
dishwasher vodka is quick and fun to make and , in most cases , the result is well worth the small effort			1
@entity232 , boiled sweets work the best all round in creating a drink that tastes and looks good			2
they all freeze well but are best drunk within a week , after which they start to lose colour and flavour			2

mix sweets and chocolate with vodka then run though dishwasher cycle
@entity247 combines the contents without losing any alcohol or flavour
we test the *recipe* using @entity86 , after eights and wine gums
