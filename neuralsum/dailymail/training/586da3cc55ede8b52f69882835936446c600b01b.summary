by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 06:44 est , 10 september 2013 updated : 13:10 est , 10 september 2013 @entity2 today demanded a deadline be set for @entity4 to destroy its stock pile of chemical weapons , in an apparent breakthrough in the international stand - off			1
with @entity10 @entity9 poised to vote on missile strikes against the @entity13 regime , the @entity4 government dramatically accepted a @entity16 proposal to turn over control of its chemical weapons to the international community			1
@entity20 , @entity21 and @entity10 planned to table a @entity24 security council resolution as early as today , setting thresholds and timetables for the plan to come into effect - but @entity16 appears set to veto it			1
' speaking in @entity42 he added : ' but he is n’t about to do it , and it ca n't be done , obviously			0
' but within hours @entity4 foreign minister @entity45 and his @entity16 counterpart @entity46 both expressed interest in the plan as did @entity24 secretary general ban ki - moon			1
@entity4 foreign minister @entity45 said after meeting with the @entity16 parliament speaker that his government quickly agreed to the @entity16 initiative to ' derail the @entity10 aggression			1
' mr @entity2 insisted it remained a ' new proposal ' but he was keen to explore if it was a ' serious one '			0
giving evidence to a committee of senior mps , the prime minister urged caution in thinking the plan would be enacted			0
mr @entity2 said : ' we have to remember that @entity4 has the biggest supply of chemical weapons anywhere in the world			2
' if it is a serious one , then it is one we should take very seriously , because it could achieve a major goal we have as a government - to get rid of chemical weapons			0
' smoke rises from buildings due to heavy artillery shelling in @entity75 , a district of @entity76 , @entity4 , today he spoke to president @entity78 about the idea during the @entity80 in @entity16 on friday			1
the two men spoke on the phone today after ‘ things moved faster than was anticipated ’ , mr @entity2 said			0
he said the security council resolution would be drafted to give ' some clarity about thresholds , that there ’s some proper timetable , some proper policies ' ' and crucially that there has to be confidence to ensure it is done			1
of course we should be sceptical			0
of course we should not forget that a major war crime has been committed			0
' i think we do need some deadlines			0
we do need some timetables			0
it is not about someone monitoring chemical weapons in @entity4			2
' it ’s got to be about handing them over to the intervational community and destroying them			0
' @entity104 says @entity21 , a permanent member of the 15 - nation @entity24 body , will start the resolution process on today			1
@entity104 said the proposal will be under chapter 7 of the @entity24 charter - which would back up the resolution with a threat of force if not applied - and will ' condemn ' a chemical weapons attack in @entity4 on august 21			1
foreign secretary @entity115 said : ' we have to make sure that this is not just a distraction tactic ' foreign secretary @entity115 also urged caution , saying : ' how do you tell the difference between breakthroughs and delay tactics ? that 's exactly what we have to think about here			0
' we have to make sure that this is not just a distraction tactic			0
' @entity21 officials said their draft resolution was designed to make sure the @entity16 proposal would have teeth , by allowing military action if @entity13 is uncooperative			1
' it was extremely well played by the @entity16 , but we did n't want someone else to go to the @entity24 with a resolution that was weak			1
this is on our terms and the principles are established			0
it puts @entity16 in a situation where they ca n't take a step back after putting a step forward , ' said a @entity21 diplomatic source			1
a @entity146 official says president @entity78 has agreed to discussions at the @entity24 @entity149 to @entity16 's proposal to secure @entity4 's chemical weapons stockpiles			1
the official says @entity78 discussed the proposal yesterday with @entity21 president @entity154 and @entity20 prime minister @entity2			1
@entity78 has said the proposal marks a potential breakthrough that could halt plans for a @entity10 military strike , though he said the details remain unclear			2
the official requested anonymity because the officials was not authorised to discuss the private conversations by name			0
but rebel forces say the @entity16 proposal ' is a cheap trick to buy time for the regime to kill more and more people , ' said @entity172 , a member of the local opposition coordinating committee in the @entity76 suburb of @entity176 , also hit by last month 's chemical attack			2
however , any deal with @entity4 to hand over its chemical weapons in the middle of a chaotic civil war would be difficult for inspectors to enforce and destroying them would likely take years , @entity10 officials and experts caution			1
@entity4 's strongest backer , @entity16 , proposed on monday that @entity76 save itself from a @entity10 military strike over its alleged use of chemical weapons by putting its stockpiles under international control			1
@entity21 foreign minister @entity104 says @entity21 will float a resolution to remove and destroy @entity4 's chemical weapons the proposal was welcomed by @entity4 and seized upon by the secretary - general of the @entity24			1
@entity10 president @entity78 said the offer was a potential breakthrough but had to be handled with skepticism			2
@entity4 has never signed a global treaty banning the storage of chemical weapons and is believed to have large stocks of sarin , mustard gas and @entity206 nerve agents			2
the actual use of chemical weapons is banned by a 1925 treaty to which @entity76 is a signatory			0
accounting for @entity4 's chemical arms cache - believed to be spread over dozens of locations - would be difficult , as would be shielding arms inspectors from violence			2
' this is a nice idea but tough to achieve , ' said one @entity10 official speaking on condition of anonymity			2
' you 're in the middle of a brutal civil war where the @entity4 regime is massacring its own people			2
does anyone think they 're going to suddenly stop the killing to allow inspectors to secure and destroy all the chemical weapons ? ' the official said			0
however , @entity16 says it is working on an ' effective , clear , concrete ' plan for putting @entity4 's chemical weapons under international control and is discussing the details with @entity76 , foreign minister @entity46 said on tuesday			1
@entity46 told reporters the plan would be presented to other nations soon and that the proposal , which @entity238 hopes will avert possible @entity10 military strikes on @entity4 , was not entirely @entity16 and grew out of contacts with the @entity10			1
it also emerged today that @entity4 rebels may launch a chemical weapon at @entity244 to provoke an international reaction			2
@entity16 foreign minister @entity46 , left , and his @entity4 counterpart @entity246			1
they say they will push for the @entity24 to continue their probe into the use of chemical weapons multiple sources have made the claim , according to @entity254 , an @entity255 news network based in @entity16			1
the rebels intend the attack to be a ' major provocation ' , according to the network a western journalist released after being held hostage in @entity4 for five months has claimed president @entity13 ’s regime was not responsible for the use of chemical weapons in a @entity76 suburb			2
@entity267 writer @entity266 , who was freed on monday , said that the rebel captors who held him prisoner claimed that it was insurgents rather than president @entity13 who had ordered the @entity274 massacre			0
@entity266 said that he and @entity275 , an @entity276 journalist who was held and released with him , heard their jailers talking about the chemical weapon attack and saying that @entity13 was not to blame			0
his co-captive @entity275 confirmed that he too had overheard the conversation through a closed door but said that he had no evidence to corroborate what he heard			0
@entity266 said the hostages despaired when they learnt that the @entity10 was planning to launch retaliatory air strikes against the @entity13 regime over the @entity76 attack			2
a @entity4 man mourning over a dead body after an alleged poisonous gas attack fired by regime forces , according to activists , in @entity292 , @entity76 , @entity4 he told @entity267 @entity294 radio : ‘ it was n't the government of @entity13 that used sarin gas or any other gas in @entity274			0
’ ‘ we are sure about this because we overheard a conversation between rebels			0
it pains me to say it because i 've been a fierce supporter of the @entity303 in its rightful fight for democracy since 2012			0
’ ‘ we were prisoners , stuck with this information and unable to report it , ’ he said			0
@entity266 and @entity275 were taken hostage in early april four days after arriving in @entity4			0
they eventually ended up in the hands of the @entity311 rebel group the @entity310			0
meanwhile , a @entity10 defence chief says military action against @entity4 will deter @entity314 from using chemical weapons			1
@entity316 : more than 110,000 people have died in the @entity4 civil war so far under secretary of defence for policy @entity321 said a retaliatory strike against the @entity4 government would uphold the international norm that chemical weapons must not be used			1
defence secretary @entity327 has warned that @entity314 possesses a massive stockpile of chemical weapons that threatens @entity330 and the 28,000 @entity10 troops stationed there			1
@entity16 's chemical weapons proposal boosted @entity334 shares today , as fears eased over military strikes			1
@entity337 at @entity338 in @entity339 said markets were boosted by the easing of concerns over @entity4 in the short term and continuing good data out of @entity345 and @entity346 , @entity334 's two biggest economies .			0
