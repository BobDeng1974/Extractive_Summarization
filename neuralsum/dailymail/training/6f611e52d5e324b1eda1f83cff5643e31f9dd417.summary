by @entity0 working with my hands has always given me a deep satisfaction , and the physical , tactile skills of gardening are an essential part of its pleasure , regardless of which plants i 'm growing			1
for ten years in the 1980s my wife @entity10 and i ran a jewellery company , designing all the pieces ourselves and , for the first few years before the business grew , making them all too			2
@entity10 had studied jewellery design but i had to learn on the job			2
one of my regrets is that i did n't maintain my silversmithing skills , because i loved working with that sublime metal			2
@entity0 says that it 's essential for us to preserve our ancient crafts before they die out but i became swept up in the desk - based business of making a living rather than making objects			1
the truth is that the demands of a professional craft require absolute dedication			2
the half - hearted soon get found out			2
we were once a nation that made everything from buttons to ships			1
now we make hardly anything , and we are losing the sense of self - worth that comes with doing something well yourself			1
this loss often extends to whole communities			2
but i believe many of us still have a hankering to learn the skills necessary to make things we can be proud of			1
i became convinced of this while filming a new series called @entity0 's @entity50			1
in it we follow three very skilled , keen amateurs in six different crafts on an intensive month - long course aimed at raising their skills to a professional level , culminating in a competition for a prestigious commercial commission			1
@entity60 , @entity61 at work the crafts in this series are blacksmithing , stonemasonry , weaving , pottery , furniture - making and glass - blowing			1
each was led by a master craftsman who lived and worked with the trainees cheek by jowl , guiding and overseeing their work , acting as mentor , instructor and , at times , brutally harsh adjudicator of their efforts			2
all the hopefuls were shocked to realise the gulf between the amateur and the working professional			2
a prime example was when @entity87 - a @entity89 - based cabinet maker who creates furniture of breathtaking quality for clients including the @entity95 - set his three trainees , @entity96 , 46 , @entity97 , 32 , and @entity98 , 30 , the task of making a box in four hours			2
they showed , i thought , remarkable skill and application , though none had finished when @entity87 called time			2
one by one he picked their work apart			0
' look at this , ' he said , peering at one of @entity97 's dovetail joints			1
' this relentless pursuit of excellence was ingrained into them all , in every craft , for 10 - 12 hours a day , seven days a week ' ' this is half a millimetre out			0
there 's a gap you could drive a car through			1
' it must be pointed out that this half - millimetre gap would be permanently hidden inside the box			1
' but i know it 's there , ' said @entity87 , ' and you know			1
and in 60 years that joint might give			0
when i make furniture i want someone to treasure it in at least 100 years ' time			1
' within half an hour of arriving at the glass - blowing works in @entity133 , @entity134 , trainees @entity135 , 39 , @entity136 , 24 , and @entity137 , 24 , were asked by master glass - blower @entity138 to make a pair of identical wine glasses			1
i 'd had a go at making a glass bowl and know that handling the molten glass is desperately tricky			0
they struggled bravely but for the most part hopelessly			0
making just one good one was tough			0
making two the same seemed impossible			0
but , as @entity138 pointed out , people buy glasses in sets			0
there seemed to be a mountain for them to climb to even begin to achieve the standard expected			0
@entity155 , 30 , @entity156 , 41 , and @entity157 , 28 , worked for days making mouldings to replace 500 - year - old stones from @entity160 , thrilled their work would stand for centuries alongside medieval craftsmanship			0
the results were astonishingly good			0
but not good enough , according to mentor @entity61			0
all three were rejected as unworthy to stand with the work of any of the masons who 'd worked on the cathedral through the ages			0
this relentless pursuit of excellence was ingrained into them all , in every craft , for 10 - 12 hours a day , seven days a week			0
trainee blacksmith , @entity175 , gets to work they spent their days in a strange combination of mental and physical exhaustion , and exhilaration at getting expert tutelage in the thing they loved most			0
at any point they could have given up ; a couple did			0
but most persevered , despite sometimes feeling hopelessly out of their depth			0
@entity175 , 23 - a petite mother from @entity189 - had trained as a farrier , making and fitting shoes for horses , but broke her back in an accident			0
this meant farriering - with its intense bursts of activity requiring great strength and awkward crouching to pick up hooves - was no longer possible			0
but she took to the steadier rhythms of blacksmithing - general metalwork using an anvil and hammer - with fierce determination despite desperately missing her baby daughter and constant pain from her injured back			0
likewise @entity207 , her fellow trainee , at 28 recovering from @entity208 and at times looking dangerously exhausted , gave himself wholeheartedly to the hours of physical labour shaping the hot metal , eventually transforming himself as well as his skills			0
but for all of them , from the glassblowers making spectacular chandeliers for the hotel chain @entity219 , to the weavers creating woven bags for smart menswear retailer @entity222 and the potters making a porcelain tea service for the chic @entity226 in @entity228 's @entity227 , it was a transformative experience			1
other than the two who decided to leave , all our trainees made scarcely believable improvements			1
some will go on to new careers in their chosen crafts			1
this series shows our hunger for excellence has n't been blunted by modern consumerism			1
the crafts passed on through the centuries are still vital , and their mastery provides a life richer and more rewarding than anything money can buy			1
@entity0 's @entity50 , mondays , 9pm , more 4 .			1

in a new series @entity0 *explores* @entity247 's hidden crafts
he says we were once a nation who made everything now we make nothing
he wants to preserve some of these forgotten crafts before they die out
