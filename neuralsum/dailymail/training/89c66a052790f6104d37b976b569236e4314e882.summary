the 14 candid questions struck a chord with women everywhere , and ended up with the blog post - then attributed to an anonymous author - clocking up millions of hits worldwide			1
but now @entity24 can reveal that the post that had mothers worldwide questioning whether they were truly ready for parenthood was actually written by a father			1
the @entity29 by author @entity2 comprises 14 steps to follow before you have children and was originally printed in his book ' a beginners guide to fatherhood ' in 1992 - long before the parenting blogs it ended up on were even invented			1
are you ready : thing you 're ready for parenthood ? read these hilarious steps by @entity2 ' i wrote the steps originally for a column for the @entity44 , @entity3 's biggest selling women 's magazine back 20 years ago when my daughters were still little			1
' it later became part of my book , which was essentially a collection of those pieces , as they proved so popular			1

in that respect i consider myself very lucky , ' he said			1
but what do his two bundles of joy , now young women , think of the book based on their childhood ? ' i dedicated the book to them and kept a copy for them both			1
but then last year they asked me about it and wanted to send copies to their friends and boyfriends - which is why i decided to make it available again online as a kindle			1
' ' i 'd have to add that i have the best two daughters in the world , they both live and work in @entity103 now , and despite all the terrible advice and disastrous mistakes described in the book , they have grown into the most extraordinary women you will ever meet			1
' one is studying literature and creative writing and the other is general manager of an inner @entity103 pub chain so they are not just chips off the old block , they are half a block each			1
