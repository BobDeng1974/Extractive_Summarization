he is ' hopeful for a positive outcome ' from his diagnosis , it was said today the @entity23 - born journalist has been the face of @entity26 ’s @entity25 since 2007			1
he was made an obe in 2008 's @entity28			2
in a statement the @entity3 said : ' he is grateful for all the good wishes he has received thus far and is optimistic for a positive outcome			1
' @entity2 asks that he and his family are given the space and privacy they require whilst he recovers			2
' our thoughts are with him and his family and we send them our very best wishes during this time			0
' until such time as @entity2 is well enough to return to work the @entity40 at @entity41 on @entity42 will be presented as usual by familiar faces from @entity40			0
' mr @entity2 first began hosting the 6pm news bulletin in early 2003 , but he stepped up to front it solo four years later following the departure of his co-host @entity47			0
he has been married to his wife , @entity48 , for 30 years and has two sons , @entity50 and @entity51			0

bowel cancer is the third most common type of cancer in men , behind prostate and lung , with almost three - quarters of cases affecting people over the age of 65			1
the 58 - year - old , who has been the face of @entity26 's @entity25 since 2007 , is ' grateful for all the good wishes he has received thus far ' in response to the news , @entity86 , chief executive of the charity @entity87 , said : ' we ’re sorry to hear that @entity2 has been diagnosed with bowel cancer			1
we wish him all the best with his treatment and recovery			2
' almost 41,000 people are diagnosed with bowel cancer every year in the @entity70 , that ’s one person every 30 minutes			1
' however , bowel cancer is very treatable when caught in the early stages when over 90 % of cases can be successfully treated			1
' the news of his diagnosis came as researchers found that one in three of us has a gene that can more than double the odds of developing bowel cancer – and the more processed meat you eat , the higher the risk			1
bowel cancer is the third most common type of cancer			1
if diagnosed in its earliest stages , the chance of surviving a further five years is 90 per cent and a complete cure is usually possible , according to @entity120 statistics			0
mr @entity2 with former news co-host @entity47			0
a statement issued today said : ' @entity2 asks that he and his family are given the space and privacy they require whilst he recovers ' processed meat products have long been blamed for increasing the odds of the disease , with some studies finding that eating as little as one sausage a day can lead to tumours			2
but this latest research is the first to find a gene that links diet with the disease			0
in the future , people ’s dna could be tested for rogue genes – and then given a diet to keep tumours at bay			0
in the largest study of its kind , @entity144 researchers pooled ten previous studies to compare the dna of more than 9,000 people with bowel cancer and a similar number without the disease			1
the results , published in the journal @entity155 , showed that around one in three of us has the rogue gene , according to researcher @entity159			0
genes come in pairs , and those who have one flawed gene and eat the most processed meat are almost twice as likely to develop bowel cancer as those who have healthy dna			1
having two rogue genes means the risk is increased 2.7 times			0
it is n’t clear how these foods interact with the gene to increase the odds of the bowel cancer , but it may be because they tamper with the immune system			1
@entity86 , of the charity @entity87 , said : ‘ there is strong scientific evidence that red and processed meats can increase your risk of bowel cancer			1
‘ this study reinforces the message that it ’s important to reduce the amount of red and processed meats that we eat			0
‘ we recommend that eating less than 500g ( 1.1lb ) of red meat a week and avoiding processed meats as much as possible			0
’ the study ’s co-researcher dr @entity193 said : ‘ the possibility that genetic variants may modify an individual ’s risk for disease based on diet has not been thoroughly investigated but represents an important new insight into disease development			0
