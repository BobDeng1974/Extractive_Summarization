mps last night backed a symbolic call for @entity2 to formally recognise the state of @entity4			1
in a landmark move , @entity0 voted by 274 to 12 to urge the government to ‘ recognise the state of @entity4 alongside the state of @entity8 ’			1
but fewer than half of @entity0 voted on the backbench motion			1
and the government , which abstained , is not bound by the vote			2
formal recognition of @entity4 as an independent state is opposed by @entity8 , and several mps said it should be granted only as part of a wider negotiation			1
he said the timing of the move was ‘ critical ’ , adding : ‘ you can only play this card once			0
’ @entity32 has been thrown into turmoil by the issue in recent days , after @entity35 indicated all @entity0 would have to back the call			0
but shadow ministers were yesterday told they could stay away from the vote , after some said they were uneasy about backing a unilateral intervention in the troubled @entity25 peace process			0
the @entity32 leadership also backed an amendment to last night ’s @entity45 motion from former foreign secretary @entity46 , which was designed to draw the sting from the debate			0
it said that recognition of @entity4 – which is opposed by @entity8 – would be only ‘ a contribution to securing a negotiated two - state settlement ’			1
some @entity0 said they had originally been told that a three - line whip had been placed on last night ’s vote , which would have forced frontbenchers who disagreed to quit their posts			0
a senior @entity32 source denied this was true and said that although unilateral recognition of @entity4 was now @entity32 policy , mps who had reservations about the move had been told they could ‘ stay away ’			1
an amendment to the motion to clarify it would only be a ' contribution to securing a two - state settlement ' with @entity8 was made by former foreign secretary @entity46 ( pictured ) and accepted by the @entity32 leadership pro-palestinian supporters position a giant banner in @entity70 yesterday prior to last night 's vote @entity32 ’s @entity71 , who called the debate , said the ‘ small but symbolically important ’ step of recognising @entity75 statehood was the only way forward in attempts to secure a peace deal based on a two - state solution			2
mr @entity46 said the vote would send a ‘ strong signal ’ to @entity8 that @entity81 backed a two - state solution			2
he said : ‘ i support the state of @entity8 , i would have supported it at the end of the 1940s			2
‘ but it can not lie in the mouth of the @entity8 government of all governments to say that they should have a veto over a state of @entity4 when for absolutely certain the @entity75 had no say whatsoever over the establishment of the state of @entity8			1
‘ today ’s debate will , i hope , send a strong signal that the @entity2 @entity81 stands four - square behind the two - state solution set out in the road map			0
’ former @entity102 foreign secretary sir @entity101 said the vote was ‘ premature ’ because there were questions surrounding how a @entity75 state could operate in keeping with norms associated with a state			0
he said efforts by other @entity111 nations to recognise @entity4 had had little impact beyond 24 hours of publicity , adding : ‘ i simply say there ’s a very great risk that we will today make ourselves feel important , our own frustration will lead us to vote for a motion which will not have the desired effect and will perhaps make the problems that have to be addressed in reaching a two - state solution more difficult to realise			1
‘ @entity122 sometimes has a purpose , it sometimes has a role , but i have to say you do not recognise a state which has not yet got the fundamental ingredients that a state requires if it ’s going to carry out its international functions and therefore , at the very least , i would respectfully suggest this motion is premature			0

@entity0 have voted *overwhelmingly* to formally recognise @entity4 as a state
but fewer than half of all mps voted and the government abstained
@entity137 as an independent state is opposed by @entity8
