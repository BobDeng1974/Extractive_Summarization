by @entity0 published : 15:07 est , 19 may 2013 updated : 02:18 est , 20 may 2013 ' @entity1 : into @entity2 ' has warped its way to a $ 70.6 million domestic launch from friday to sunday , though it 's not setting any light - speed records with a debut that 's lower than the studio 's expectations			1
the latest voyage of the @entity10 fell short of its predecessor , 2009 's ‘ @entity1 , ’ which opened with $ 75.2 million			1
since premiering wednesday in huge - screen @entity14 theaters and expanding thursday to general cinemas , ‘ @entity18 ’ has pulled in $ 84.1 million , well below distributor @entity17 's initial forecast of $ 100 million			1
@entity19 ? the follow - up to 2009 's hit is an easy winner at the box office , but its mission falls short of some analysts ' forecasts the film added $ 40 million overseas , pushing its total to $ 80.5 million since it began rolling out internationally a week earlier			1
the ‘ @entity1 ’ sequel bumped ‘ @entity32 ’ down to second place after two weekends on top			1
@entity35 's superhero saga took in $ 35.2 million domestically to lift its receipts to $ 337.1 million			1
overseas , ‘ @entity32 ’ added $ 40.2 million , raising its international total to $ 736.2 million and its worldwide tally to nearly $ 1.1 billion			1
while ‘ @entity32 ’ and ‘ @entity18 ’ did well overseas , they were outmatched by the debut of @entity44 's ‘ @entity43 , ’ which followed its domestic debut a week earlier with a wide rollout internationally			1
‘ gatsby ’ pulled in $ 42.1 million overseas , coming in a bit ahead of both ‘ @entity32 ’ and ‘ @entity18			1
’ crash and burn : the opening weekend fell short of forecasts , which projected a weekend haul of $ 90 million to $ 100 million domestically , ‘ gatsby ’ held up well at no. 3 with $ 23.4 million , lifting its total to $ 90.2 million			1
in today 's @entity57 of bigger , better sequels , follow - up films often outdo the box office of their predecessors , as each ‘ @entity62 ’ sequel has done			0
while ‘ @entity18 ’ earned good reviews and is getting strong word - of - mouth from fans , the film did not quite measure up to the opening weekend of director @entity68 ' ‘ @entity1 ’ reboot from four years ago , at least domestically			1
' @entity1 ' remains a fan - boy movie			0
it does n't seem to have the same kind of cross-over appeal as say an ` @entity62 ' or some of these others , ’ said @entity74 , an analyst for box - office tracker @entity75			0
‘ it 's a very specific brand , but i think the general public would love this movie , because it 's such an action movie			0
but to get a hundred - million - plus opening weekend , unless you 're ` twilight , ' you really have to cross over to all audiences			0
’ failure : four years of anticipation and help from @entity85 ticket prices has n't given @entity18 much of a boost @entity17 points out that overseas business is up in many markets , though , so that worldwide , the sequel is off to a better start			0
‘ because of the nature of the franchise , because of how many movies have been made and the various forms of the tv shows , i 'm not sure that ` @entity1 ' goes by the rules of normal sequels			0
i think each movie stands on its own , because it 's a unique franchise , ’ said @entity101 , @entity17 's head of distribution			0
‘ my goal was always that we grow the franchise			0
we 're clearly seeing by today 's numbers that the movie is being embraced on a worldwide basis in a way we 've never seen before			0
’ @entity101 said that domestically , ‘ @entity18 ’ finished its first weekend 6 percent ahead of revenues for 2009 's ‘ @entity1 , ’ which got a head - start with $ 4 million in thursday night previews to give it a $ 79.2 million haul through the first sunday			1
actor @entity113 : an impressive 89 % of moviegoers on @entity115 said they liked the movie actress @entity117 arrives at the premiere : analysts have suggested the disappointing debut could force a quick exit from theaters but ‘ @entity18 ’ had a full day of screenings thursday plus its wednesday @entity14 business			1
unlike the first movie , which played only in 2 - @entity127 , the sequel also had the benefit of @entity85 screenings that cost a few dollars more			0
yet even with the @entity85 upcharge and the earlier debut , it came away with just $ 4.9 million more than its predecessor through sunday			1
still , it 's a solid starting place for the movie to live long and prosper at theaters , with @entity17 hoping ‘ @entity18 ’ can surpass the $ 385 million worldwide total of ‘ @entity1			1
’ ‘ i think we 're well along on that road , ’ @entity101 said			0
‘ @entity18 , ’ $ 70.6 million ( $ 40 million international )			1
