the @entity2 has turned from a ' great institution ' into a ' sinister and nasty ' organisation which is not interested in animal welfare , the head of the @entity1 has warned			2
general sir @entity6 has urged his members to stop donating to the charity because they are becoming more interested in animal rights issues such as fox hunting and badger culls			1
the former @entity13 comanding officer , who served in @entity14 and @entity15 , also questioned where the charity 's ' authority ' came from and believes the animal inspectors have been given intrusive powers which have no basis in law			1
controversial : the @entity2 were criticised earlier this year for private prosecutions they brought against hunts in the @entity26 ( file picture ) sir @entity6 raised money for the @entity2 as a youngster but now wants a new organisation to replace the 189 - year - old charity , he told the @entity33			1
they have received heavy criticism from rural campaigners after their campaigning during the fox hunting ban and the badger cull was investigated by the @entity40			0
last year , the @entity2 was condemned during its pursuit of fox hunters , after it spent £ 326,000 on a private prosecution against @entity45 ’s @entity44			0
change : sir @entity6 hopes a new charity will replace the @entity2 in fighting for animal welfare the judge in the case questioned whether members ' money could have been better spent			1
more recently , the charity has infuriated dairy farmers by trying to stop the badger cull , intended to halt the spread of bovine tuberculosis			2
sir @entity6 claims farmers were targeted and ' intimated ' by campaigners during the bid and is concerned ministers may now drop the policy			1
his cattle herd was shut down because of an outbreak of @entity65 , and he claims to have only just cleared the financial costs			0
' it ’s a sad story			0
a once great @entity26 institution has been turned from an animal welfare organisation to one concerned with animal rights			2
' they have no statutory responsibility , yet when their inspectors turn up in uniform it ’s as a private organisation			0
there is something rather sinister and nasty about it			0
' in the interview he also claimed that the @entity82 was responsible for turning the countryside into ' some sort of theme park ' and said the @entity86 was guilty of portraying rural people as ' @entity88 '			1
sir @entity6 also attacked the limited mobile reception in rural areas of @entity26 saying there is more signal in @entity93 than in @entity94			1
he said the @entity86 ’s coverage of the countryside was neither fair nor balanced and said @entity97 had failed to cover issues such as shooting			2
in terms of mobile phone coverage , he claims there is an ongoing ' digital apartheid ' between urban and rural areas			1
other nations manage to cover 98 per cent of their population , whereas in the @entity26 it is around bout 80 per cent			0
a spokesman for the @entity2 said : ' sir @entity6 's interview shows once again how far out of touch he and his colleagues at the pro bloodsports @entity1 are with the reality of public opinion in this country			1
' he is clearly unhappy that the @entity2 continues to be proud to represent the views of the majority of @entity26 people who do not want to see the return of fox hunting and to speak for animals who have no choice and no voice			0
' this has been reinforced once again this week by a new opinion polling showing that more than 80 % of both rural and urban dwellers oppose any repeal of the hunting act			0
anger : sir @entity6 also condemned the charity 's attempt to stop the badger cull in @entity135 and @entity136 ' sir @entity6 criticises the @entity2 for bringing a prosecution against a hunt , but fails to mention that the hunt pleaded guilty and the judge in the case was himself criticised for making unhelpful and inappropriate comments			1
' he also criticises the @entity2 's inspectors , who work every day of the year to ensure animals are protected from cruelty			0
indeed most of their visits involve giving support and advice to pet owners to help them improve care for their animals			0
but in some cases the only option is the legal route			0
' the @entity2 has over a million supporters - a number that is growing , contrary to sir @entity6 's assertion			1
' the @entity2 does not apologise for doing what the charity was formed to do more than 100 years ago - stopping animal abuse and without fear or favour , bringing those who harm animals to justice .			2

sir @entity6 urged members to stop giving to animal charity
