@entity2 , 17 , suffered severe burns and died immediately after putting his ear to the live rail to see if his train was approaching @entity12 station in @entity13 , an inquest heard			1
@entity2 , who had come to the @entity15 from @entity8 with his family 18 months earlier , had already walked across the tracks to the intercom to ask staff why his train was late			1
the 17 - year - old then clambered down from the platform again , knelt down and leaned towards the deadly rail , which discharged a shock that killed him instantly			2
an inquest was told that the teenager , who was making his first solo train journey in @entity15 , would probably not have known about live rails			1
his father , @entity28 , told police in a statement : ‘ he has never travelled alone by train			2
in @entity8 trains operate on coal or diesel			0
i do n’t think @entity2 would have known the rails are full of electricity			1
‘ in @entity8 you can walk across the track			0
’ the popular teenager was three weeks into a work experience placement at an @entity43 and @entity44 restaurant in @entity12 and had been excited about returning to his family in @entity45 , @entity46 , to celebrate the @entity48 festival of @entity49			1
his death prompted his family and a local councillor to call for greater emphasis on rail - side warnings , especially in an age when more people are travelling to @entity15 to live and work			1
@entity57 , a customer service operator for @entity59 , told police in a statement how on august 7 last year he was on duty in his office , answering calls from the public and operating the cctv cameras across the network			0
he said he received a call at 10.20pm from @entity12 station from a foreign man who was asking why the board at the station said the train was at 10.40pm when online it had said it would call at 10.30pm			1
he told him it was running late and then advised him on where to change for the journey home			2
the next thing mr @entity57 knew of the situation was when a duty manager called him asking him to review @entity82 footage from @entity12 after receiving reports of a body on the line			1
detective sergeant @entity86 , of @entity87 , said : ‘ it shows mr @entity2 arriving at the station at about 10.09pm , on his own , carrying a suitcase			1
‘ he goes onto the platform			0
he jumps down onto the tracks crosses the tracks on foot , on to the other platform , where he is for a couple of minutes , then crosses back over the tracks			2
‘ he stays for a few seconds , goes down on the tracks , goes on to his knees , leans forward , puts his head onto the tracks			2
’ an inquest was told that the teenager , who was making his first solo train journey in @entity15 from @entity12 station ( pictured ) , would probably not have known about live rails mr @entity57 said the next thing visible was smoke , before @entity2 was seen lying on the tracks			1
@entity107 , from the @entity109 restaurant , said : ‘ in @entity8 to find out if a train is approaching you would kneel on the ground and put your ear to the rail			2
’ mr @entity107 also described @entity2 as ‘ a very nice boy ’ who was liked by everybody at the restaurant and had already become good friends with people in the short time he was with them			1
chef @entity122 said : ‘ i only knew him for three weeks but i ’m upset because he was such a lovely person			0
’ he had been excited at the prospect of going home but turned down an offer to be dropped off at @entity127 railway station because he did not want to be any trouble			0
instead he accepted help in working out train times , packed his case and made his way to the nearby station			0
soon afterwards , staff saw emergency vehicles converging on the site			0
the inquest heard that officers told them there was a trespasser on the railway			1
mr @entity2 , through local district and county councillor @entity143 , questioned whether the train information boards had been working at the time his son was at the station , because he had been agitated by the late - running train			1
mr @entity2 told the coroner : ‘ my son was a lovely , lively , happy boy who had just sat his exams at college and has got good results			2
he wanted to go to further education college			0
‘ i ca n’t believe this has happened and my family are all in great shock			0
’ @entity2 's death prompted his family and a local councillor to call for greater emphasis on rail - side warnings but assistant coroner @entity165 , presiding at the inquest in @entity164 , @entity13 , said : ‘ it ’s not the fact that the train was running late that causes his death			1
it ’s his going down on to the track			0
’ she concluded : ‘ he was an extremely likeable young man who was looking forward to going home and may well have been anxious about his late - running train			2
‘ however , for reasons we will never know he decided to go down onto the track rather than use the footbridge to ascertain when that train was coming			0
‘ he appears to place his ear to the track , possibly to determine when his late - running train will arrive and not appreciating the tracks are electrified			1
‘ i will record that he died as an accident			0
’ afterwards mr @entity143 said : ‘ what we have to do is make the public more aware of the dangers of people jumping onto the tracks			0
‘ a large number of people are coming from @entity190 , @entity191 and @entity192 and there needs to be a system to let the public know it ’s dangerous			0
‘ the warnings have to be on the platform , in front of you			0

@entity2 , 17 , died immediately in @entity12 , @entity13 , an inquest heard
he had already crossed the tracks to ask staff why his train was late
the teenager , who moved to the @entity15 18 months *ago* and was travelling alone by train for the first time , may not have known about live rails
