it was @entity1 , that most sympathetic observer of human weakness , who said of his friend , the dramatist @entity4 : ‘ no man was more foolish when he had not a pen in his hand , nor more wise when he had			1
’ this morning , therefore , offer a kind thought for @entity9 , who was once an @entity10 cricketer			1
with a bat in his hand he achieved remarkable things			1
with a pen he fools nobody but himself			2
and after the @entity17 document about last winter ’s disastrous @entity19 tour was leaked on tuesday , @entity9 looks very foolish indeed			1
in case you have n’t heard , @entity9 has just published an autobiography which seeks to ‘ blow the lid ’ off cricket , in particular the people he used to play with before they tired of him			1
@entity9 's autobiography was written with the purpose of blowing the lid off cricket the former @entity10 international did that , but he has also damaged his already soiled reputation beyond repair 2009 : resigns as @entity10 captain after a rift with coach @entity36 2010 : fined for an obscene @entity38 outburst after being dropped from @entity40 squad 2012 : sends provocative texts about @entity42 to @entity43 2012 : reintegrated into team after missing out on a central contract 2014 : sacked after @entity17 lose patience with his @entity19 tour behaviour he has blown the lid off all right , but at the expense of damaging his own reputation , already soiled , beyond repair			1
even @entity58 , the @entity10 wicketkeeper who feels the full force of @entity9 ’s fury , may decide that pity is the most appropriate response			1
for what the book confirms is the self - willed fall from grace of a cricketer who had the world at his feet yet never learned to show a straighter bat to that world , and who may now be wondering why so many people share @entity42 ’s unprintable opinion of his character			1
@entity9 ’s model for his book seems to be @entity76 , where words mean what @entity76 wants them to mean			1
the world , viewed through the filter of @entity9 ’s imagination , is full of little men who were put on earth to halt his progress towards immortality			1
@entity9 ( left ) was all smiles during an @entity10 training session with @entity42 in august 2011 what has made cricket - followers roar is @entity9 ’s confession that in 2012 , a summer disfigured by his betrayal of @entity42 , who was then a much - admired @entity10 captain , he blubbed in the dressing - room at @entity93 after he had made a wonderful century against @entity94			1
why ? because he thought some team - mates were involved in a spoof @entity38 account which mocked his rampant egotism			0
‘ i was completely broken , absolutely finished , mentally shot , ’ he said ( peeling an onion ) in an interview to accompany the book launch			2
here we go again , everybody			0
it ’s all about me , me , me ! @entity107 cricket is full of heroic tales			2
in 1933 , at @entity111 , @entity109 of @entity110 left his sick - bed with a temperature of 102 to make 83 runs that helped win a test match			0
thirty years later , at @entity117 , @entity118 went out to face the mighty @entity119 with a broken arm to ensure the @entity116 did not win			0
@entity9 described @entity122 's captaincy of the @entity10 cricket team as ' weak ' and ' tactically inept ' most famously , at @entity93 in 1981 , @entity124 responded to a run of wretched form that cost him the captaincy by giving the greatest all - round performance in the history of our game to turn a @entity132 , and a series , on its head			1
@entity124 ’s ashes , they still call it , and always will			0
did @entity109 say : ‘ i shall stay in bed today ’ ? did @entity118 say : ‘ it ’s not worth it ’ ? did @entity124 say , as @entity9 did at @entity143 : ‘ it ’s not easy being me in this dressing - room ’ ? not a trace of it			1
they pulled on their boots and strapped on their pads			0
‘ @entity155 ’ @entity9 , on the other hand , went : ‘ @entity156 , the rotters are being beastly ! it ’s so unfair ! ’ the rotters have always been unfair to @entity9 on his ‘ incredible journey ’ through cricket : my word , how he loves his ‘ incredibles ’ ! they forced him out of @entity164 when he was 20 and have made his life a misery ever since			1
only last week , @entity167 released him from his contract			0
it may have had something to do with the fact he was rarely spotted at @entity172			0
where the @entity10 team is concerned , it has been evident for some time that , taken as a group , they are not the most attractive group of players			2
as for @entity9 ’s claims that a culture of ‘ bullying ’ existed , we shall hear more anon and the revelations from other witnesses may not be in his favour			1
cricketers are not , on the whole , mean - spirited			0
in a team environment that tests the bonds of friendship or mutual respect , because of the months they are obliged to spend with one another , they tend to be collegiate creatures , happy to rub along with whoever they find alongside them			0
@entity9 ( left ) pictured with @entity201 at the end of the fourth @entity19 cricket test in @entity204 in 2010 @entity9 , pictured during the last @entity19 series , told his side of the story in his new autobiography @entity209 blastst former @entity10 ' regime ' so it has always been significant @entity9 has proved unable to find a companionable berth in any dressing - room he has shared			1
from @entity214 to @entity215 , by way of @entity217 and @entity218 , he has been mistrusted by colleagues who may have tolerated his selfishness but who rarely found a kind word to say for his comradeship			0
for all his inane prattle about ‘ buddies ’ , @entity9 found few allies and fewer friends			2
‘ has our famous batsman failed ? ’ a @entity229 player asked reporters one day at @entity218 after hearing that @entity9 had been dismissed in the @entity132			2
‘ oh dear , what a pity			0
’ one may judge a man by his friends			0
one may also judge him by those he perceives to be enemies			0
evidently @entity9 has little time for @entity241 , the former coach , whose principled opposition to the genocidal @entity243 is well - known ; to @entity42 , who enjoys the respect of everybody within the game ; and to @entity247 , the managing director of @entity107 cricket , who has never made a foe in his life			1
he also called @entity251 , @entity247 ’s predecessor , who fought a courageous battle against cancer , a ‘ weak p * * * k ’			0
upon receiving his 100th cap , @entity9 described the @entity10 dressing room in november 2013 as ' the best environment that i have ever experienced ' only to then describe and deride a ' bullying ' culture within the team the model for @entity9 's autobiography seems to be @entity76 ... he sees what he wants to see clearly he is not the most rounded of men			1
unable to sense mood or interpret events in the way that a better balanced person would , he has come to rely on a small army of advisers who have not always served him well			0
all together now : me , me me ! his friends could have told him that it was unwise to cover his forearms with @entity10 tattoos before he had played a single test for his adopted country			2
they could have told him breathless attempts to be pally with famous players usually rebound on the groveller , and that words such as ‘ dude ’ and ‘ buddy ’ reveal the speaker to be a twerp			0
instead @entity9 became cocooned in a tower of illusions and frustrations , railing against a world of deceivers , as self - deceivers often do			2
some cricket - lovers are sympathetic , to a degree			0
most washed their hands of him a long time ago			0
@entity9 ( right ) has a series of high - profile supporters , including @entity302 ( centre ) he should have been remembered for his magnificent strokeplay , and indeed his handful of superb innings will be recalled whenever people consider his cricket			1
but , after this latest shabby exercise in score - settling , the @entity9 story will be known mainly for the lamentations of the most self - obsessed sportsman of our age			2
sir @entity316 , the dramatist and @entity318 - winning screenwriter , also came to this country from @entity94 , and loves cricket with a passion			0
yesterday , reflecting on the @entity9 imbroglio , he said something magnificent			2
‘ there is such a thing as the spirit of the game , and that spirit has triumphed , to his disadvantage			0
’ meanwhile , somewhere through the looking - glass , @entity76 wants a friend to hold her hand .			1

with a bat in his hand @entity9 achieved remarkable things , but with a pen he fools nobody but himself
@entity9 wanted to ' blow the lid off ' cricket with his autobiography , which he has done , but he has also damaged his reputation beyond repair
@entity9 ’s model for his book seems to be @entity76 , where words mean what @entity76 wants them to mean
one of the major revelations @entity9 reveals in his book is that of the bullying culture he claims was present in the @entity10 dressing room
