by @entity0 published : 11:10 est , 21 october 2013 updated : 16:34 est , 21 october 2013 at first glance £ 1.7million appears a low asking price for a @entity4 island complete with woodland , private beaches and its own monastery			2
but the piece of land has been on the market for three years and despite cutting the asking price in half , the owners have n't even had a viewing			1
that is because this is the haunted island of @entity16 , @entity17 , where 48 people accused of being @entity20 sympathisers were brutally executed in 1944			1
costing just £ 1.7million , this island may look like a tempting buy , but beware : this is the site where 48 people were massacred at the end of @entity25 , and the locals say it 's haunted by their ghosts looking for justice legend has it that spirits of the dead men haunt the island , demanding justice against those responsible deserted : even the owners of the island near popular tourist spots do not live on it - and few tourists visit on october 24th , almost exactly 69 years ago , @entity42 partisans celebrated their victory over the @entity44 by rounding up anyone they thought corroborated with the enemy , including the village priest and mayor , @entity49			1
the ' guilty ' were then rowed out to the island where they were gunned down in cold blood and left unburied			1
the locals were told that the same fate awaited them if they intervened , so the corpses remained uncovered for decades and it was n't until recent years that they were finally laid to rest			2
the victims were gunned down on cold blood and then left unburied on the island for decades the 48 men accused of sympathising with the @entity44 included the town 's priest @entity49 who was also the mayor during @entity64 occupation legend has it that the spirits of the dead men haunt the island , demanding justice against those responsible			1
to date , the crime has never been investigated			0
@entity72 and @entity73 , the current owners , do n't live on the island and even at the height of the tourist season , few ever venture there			2
the 12 acre island sits in front of @entity82 's @entity81 port and despite the members of the @entity84 visiting the site in october , 2009,it remains uninhabited			1
by comparison nearby @entity82 , a @entity87 , is a popular holiday spot , especially with the rich and famous			0
the likes of @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 and @entity96 have all spent summers there			0
marshal @entity99 was the @entity100 president of former @entity101 of @entity42 of which @entity17 was a part @entity17 did not exist as a country for most of @entity25 , when the massacre took place , but was instead part of @entity42			2
from the end of @entity109 , when the state was first created , @entity17 were unhappy with the union as they felt too much power had been handed to the @entity113			0
when the @entity64 invaded after the start of @entity25 , they exploited @entity17 discontent to get soldiers to mutiny			0
once @entity42 was under @entity20 control , @entity17 was made an independent state and the @entity120 were put into power			0
they began persecuting @entity113 , jews , @entity124 and non-fascist @entity17 and between 350,000 and 450,000 victims were killed in massacres and the notorious concentration camp at @entity128			0
after the defeat of @entity130 and the @entity44 , @entity17 became a republic within the @entity132			0
under communist control , many partisans in @entity42 felt the need for revenge against their @entity20 persecutors and carried out acts of violence against those they held responsible			1
the massacre at @entity16 , in which 48 supposed @entity20 sympathisers were killed without trial , is one example			1
no investigation into the killings has ever taken place , and none of the perpetrators have been identified .			0

owners have been trying to sell @entity16 , near @entity82 , for three years
despite *halving* asking price they have not had a single viewing
uninhabited island was the site of @entity25 massacre by communist partisans
men accused of being @entity20 sympathisers were rowed there and shot
*bodies* were left unburied for decades after families were *threatened*
