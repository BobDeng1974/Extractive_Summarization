a woman who gained 120lbs as a side effect of her polycystic ovary syndrome , a hormonal disorder , started shedding the weight after running her first half marathon - and has since lost 135lbs			1
@entity8 , from @entity9 , @entity10 , struggled with her weight her entire life before she was diagnosed with @entity3 in 2000			1
six years later she managed to slim down by following a grueling diet and exercise plan - but her restricting regimen was n't sustainable and she soon began piling the pounds back on , gaining 120lbs			0
in 2013 however , she underwent lap band surgery to help control her weight , and was soon inspired to start running			1
' i was always drawn to that finish - line feeling , but i never thought running was possible for me , ' she told @entity22			0
shocking transformation : @entity8 , from @entity9 , @entity10 , lost 135lbs after having lap band surgery in 2013 starting out : before she lost the weight ( @entity26 ) , @entity8 joined a running team and began training for her first half marathon			1
she finished her second @entity30 this month ( r ) ' it was difficult and painful when i was heavier , ' she recalled			0
' but i was so motivated by my friend 's story of how exciting her race was			0
i knew i wanted to try it			0
' @entity8 completed both the 2014 and 2015 @entity10 @entity37 , and now she is training to run a whopping 26.2 miles during the @entity39 this november			1
her training plan , which includes spin classes , bootcamp classes and weight lifting , as well as running , has helped her lose 135lbs			2
and now that she has slimmed down , @entity8 is slowly but surely gaining her confidence back			2
new woman : @entity8 put on 120lbs as a side effect of her polycystic ovary syndrome , a hormonal disorder that causes weight gain ( @entity26 )			1
after her weight loss surgery , she learned how to control her portions ( r ) not easy : even though @entity8 struggled to run when she was heavier , she stuck with it ' i used to hate dating and think i 'd have to settle for just anybody , but i do n't feel that way anymore , ' she said			1
' the most important change is i accept myself			0
' @entity8 noted that although she still has excess skin on her arms and legs , she is finally happy with herself			2
but getting to this point was far from easy for @entity8 , who had tried almost everything to control her weight			1
before she was diagnosed with pcos in her senior year of high school , @entity8 had rapidly put on pounds and was starting to lose her hair			2
big smile : @entity8 can be seen snapping an action selfie during her most recent race more confident : @entity8 said she has gained her confidence back after her weightloss transformation @entity3 made her insulin - resistant , so it was nearly impossible for her to lose weight			1
she was given various medications and shots - including prescription diet pills - but nothing worked			0
@entity8 eventually hired a personal trainer and followed a strict diet plan that was created for her by a nutritionist			0
she managed to lose 120lbs over the course of a year , but working out two hours per day and living on a diet of only vegetables and protein left her with little to no social life			0
when the weight slowly crept back onto her frame , she finally considered lap band surgery , which is intended to reduce the quantity of food consumed			1
the procedure involves an inflatable device being placed around the top portion of the stomach to create a smaller stomach pouch , essentially shrinking stomach capacity			0
amazing fete : @entity8 posed in a black dress ( @entity26 ) before she lost 115lbs and 42.5 inches off her frame ( r ) personal win : @entity8 can be seen holding the medal she received after she completed the @entity30 @entity8 noted that she did n't want people to think she had ' taken the easy way out ' , but she quickly learned it was a ' tool , not a miracle '			2
she still had to learn how to control her portions and make healthy choices , while maintaining a regular workout schedule			0
@entity8 proudly showed her fifth grade students her completion medal after she completed her first half marathon			1
and when one of her students congratulated her for winning the race , @entity8 did n't correct her , explaining that , in a way , she felt like she had won after overcoming such adversity in order to achieve her goals .			0
