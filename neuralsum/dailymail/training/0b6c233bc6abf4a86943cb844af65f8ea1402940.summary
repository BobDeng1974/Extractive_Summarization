this is the incredible photo showing two @entity2 sprinters crossing the finish line on the same thousandth of a second during trials for the @entity7 - a finish too close for even the camera to call			1
now a toss of a coin or a head - to - head sprint could decide whether @entity14 or @entity15 represents the country in the women 's 100 meters at the @entity7 , athletics officials said			1
@entity18 and @entity15 finished in a dead heat - at 11.068 seconds - for third place in saturday 's 100 final at the @entity2 @entity23 trials			1
they both leaned into the finish line and their torsos , by which a winner is judged , were even			1
until now , there has been no protocol for determining the winner			1
the race is decided by when their torsos cross the line , and the picture showed a tie officials spent most of the next 24 hours developing a procedure for breaking the deadlock			1
each nation can be represented by a maximum of three athletes per event at the @entity51			1
@entity2 officials said the final place , who would join world champion @entity55 and @entity56 for the 100 in @entity57 , would be determined by the time the trials end on july 1			2
' we will select our team before we leave here , ' @entity60 ( @entity60 ) spokeswoman @entity59 said			2
battle : the track timer had initially named @entity15 , right , as the winner before officials reviewed the results under the procedure , if neither athlete declines a position on the team , they can choose either a run - off or coin flip			1
@entity75 , who coaches both athletes , said he considered the procedure , which was developed by @entity60 and @entity79 officials , to be fair			2
' but if there is a run - off , the health of the athlete must be protected , ' @entity75 said			2
if the two women fail to agree on which option to employ , the final place will be decided by a race			2
if they choose the toss of a coin , @entity18 , as the highest ranking athlete , would pick heads or tails			0
the procedure , a two - page document , even specified details of the coin , which must be a quarter dollar with the image of first @entity2 president @entity98 on one side and an eagle on the reverse			0
disbelief : the two women finished dead heat for the third position on the women 's 100m @entity23 team both @entity18 and @entity15 will compete in the 200 trials on thursday and the finals for that event are on saturday			1
they have not been given an official deadline by which to make their decision for the 100 metre place			0
@entity114 said they would not make their choice until after the 200 metre trials			0
@entity75 said that track officials ' need to leave my athletes alone and let me coach them in the 200 , then make a decision			0
' he added that he would not choose which runner made the @entity23 team because ' it would be like , " which kid do you love the most ? " ' ' i ’ve never seen anything like this , ' @entity128 , a four - time @entity23 sprinter from @entity129 who now works as an @entity131 boradcaster , said , the @entity134 reported			0
support : the two women have the same trainer and contracts with @entity138			0
if they choose to run in a head - to - head , it will take place after this weekend , when they are both trying out for the 200m team anxious : @entity18 ( right ) is keen to compete in the @entity23 100m even though her main event is 200m ' how long has this sport been around ? it ’s crazy that there ’s not something very specific			0
i guarantee that there will be something put in there now			0
how we reached this point without a rule , i have no idea			0
' at first , the timer had ruled @entity15 was the winner , with @entity18 , who has won three @entity23 medals , placing one - thousandth of a second behind her			1
brandishing a mini @entity2 flag , @entity15 went to a news conference with @entity55 and @entity166 , while @entity18 gave an emotional interview and said ' fourth is the worst '			1
but track officials revised the results and discovered there had been a tie			0
