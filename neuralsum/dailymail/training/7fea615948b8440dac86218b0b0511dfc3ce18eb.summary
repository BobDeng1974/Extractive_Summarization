by @entity1 - @entity0 follow @ @ riathalsam @entity2 has done it again			2
a year after dumping @entity4 out of the second round at @entity6 he sent @entity7 packing at the same stage			1
the world no 86 perhaps thought a posting on court 12 might keep him below the radar			0
but matches involving @entity7 are rarely quiet			0
and upsetting the 12th seed ensures he will inflate his reputation so long as he keeps his footing on grass			0
this was a performance of domination , a sustained beating that rarely , if ever , looked like letting up			0
he ultimately saw off the @entity24 6 - 4 , 6 - 3 , 7 - 6			1
winner : @entity2 of @entity26 is through to the third round of @entity6 after beating @entity7 defeated : the @entity24 reached the semi-finals of the @entity29 two weeks ago it was impressive , but also a combustion of sorts from @entity7 , a man as volatile as he is gifted			1
the key moment came in the second set when , having already lost the first , @entity7 staved off a host of break points at 3 - 3			2
but he finally cracked , two straight double faults giving @entity2 the edge			2
‘ what is wrong with my serve ? ’ @entity7 shouted			0
it became a theme , until he later directed his self criticism at his handling of spin			0
it was that sort of match for the @entity29 semi-finalist , but @entity2 did not get distracted by the histrionics and closed out the third - set tie break 7 - 5 for another impressive win			1
throwback : @entity2 celebrating his victory over @entity4 at @entity6 last year shock result : the @entity55 legend was the reigning champion at the time			1
