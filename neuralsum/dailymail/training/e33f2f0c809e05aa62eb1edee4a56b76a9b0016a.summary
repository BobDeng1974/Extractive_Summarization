by @entity0 last updated at 1:19 pm on 25th january 2012 when @entity2 loaned out one of its top - of - the - range supercars to a @entity6 police force , the firm must have been fairly confident the vehicle was in safe hands			2
but as these pictures show , the car was n't exactly returned in the same immaculate condition in which it arrived			0
a @entity13 ( @entity13 ) officer was taking the @entity15 - which has a top speed of 155mph - for a test drive on a public road at 2am			1
destroyed : this is all that remains of a £ 40,000 top of the range @entity2 which was loaned to @entity13 for a test drive @entity13 had borrowed the vehicle for two days so its officers could get a feel for it before the force decided whether to buy some of the cars			1
but , after skidding at a roundabout in @entity32 , @entity33 , the unfortunate officer lost control of the £ 40,000 supercar			1
the top - of - the - range vehicle was written off and the policeman , in his 40s , had to be rescued by firefighters			1
the officer , who is from the automatic number plate recognition intercept unit which patrols car crime hotspots , suffered spinal injuries and was taken to hospital , although he has since been discharged			2
it is not known how fast he was travelling when the accident happened			0
the force has now suspended him from driving duties			2
the car is the most powerful and fastest - accelerating @entity50 ever produced			0
it can accelerate from 0 to 62mph in just 5.7 seconds			0
top condition : how the £ 40,000 @entity53 should look a senior source said : ' the car was being tested and it went horribly wrong			2
' police do use public roads to test vehicles - the risk is reduced by the location and the time when this is done			1
' another officer in a powerful @entity64 had gone out on patrol with him at the same time - but was patrolling elsewhere when the accident happened			2
' the @entity64 driver went to the scene immediately after the crash to help			0
the @entity2 was on loan as the company are trying to sell them to the force			0
time to think : @entity13 is to review its policy of using public roads to test - drive cars following the crash ' it would appear there were icy conditions on the night it happened			1
' it was being tested in the early hours and the car had been with the force for a couple of days			0
' the idea was to get a few officers to get a feel for it - get a reasonable sample before deciding whether to buy them			0
' now the force , which had insured the car , is to review its policy of using public roads to test - drive cars			1
no decision has yet been made by the force on whether to buy any @entity96 in a statement @entity13 said : ' as a result of this incident @entity13 is currently reviewing its policy on officers test driving demonstration cars on public roads			1
' that review is ongoing and it would be inappropriate to make any further comment			0

firefighters rescued officer after he skidded at roundabout and lost control of £ 40,000 vehicle
@entity13 suspend officer from driving duties and will review its policy of using public roads to test - drive cars
