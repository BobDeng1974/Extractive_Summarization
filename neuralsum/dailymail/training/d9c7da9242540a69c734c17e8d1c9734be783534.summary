by @entity0 cinema tickets prices are soaring meaning fewer people can go out to watch films families are cutting back on visits to the cinema amid spiralling prices both for tickets and snacks			1
the average ticket price has increased by more than 26 per cent since 2007 at the same time as incomes in working households have fallen by 6.4 per cent			2
at one time thousands of children would spend every saturday morning at the cinema enjoying homemade dramas from the @entity16 or serials from the @entity18			0
however , today a trip to see the latest blockbuster , whether that is @entity21 or @entity23 ’s @entity22 , starring @entity24 , is so expensive that it can only be an occasional treat			0
the latest figures from the @entity27 ’ @entity25 put the average cinema ticket in the @entity29 at £ 6.53 , however families in @entity32 and the south face much higher prices			1
for example , tickets at the @entity35 in @entity36 , @entity37 , work out at £ 12.70 for an adult or £ 36.40 for a family of four			1
once you add in the cost of transport , popcorn and drinks , the cost could quite easily top £ 50			1
researchers at the accountants @entity48 found even families with a household income of more than £ 55,000 are rationing their trips to the cinema			2
@entity48 said : ‘ in a year in which @entity29 films and talent were recognised at many award ceremonies , 27 out of 73 constituencies in @entity32 had no cinema			1
this finding has led to suggestions that poorer people are less well served by the cinema industry			2
‘ a combination of price rises and falling incomes makes the cinema relatively less accessible , a trend reflected in the survey data , which shows that higher income groups are significantly more likely to visit the cinema than low - income groups			0
‘ some 28per cent of those earning more than £ 58,000 per annum visited the cinema at least monthly , compared to 18per cent of those who earn less than £ 20,000			0
’ similarly , 70per cent of households in the higher income bracket go at least twice a year , however this falls to 39per cent for those earning less than £ 20,000			0
as fewer people go to the cinema , it becomes increasingly difficult for the industry to build new ones and maintain those that exist , particularly in poorer areas			1
there have also been costs associated with providing new digital projection systems and sound systems			0
a family of four in @entity36 , @entity37 , will be set back more than £ 50 for travel , popcorn and tickets @entity48 said : ‘ a relatively small , two screen , 400 - seat cinema costs around £ 3million to build , and the industry has had to absorb the capital costs of digitisation over the past decade , reducing the capital available to build new infrastructure			1
‘ it is therefore little surprise that large cinemas are being placed close to the richer audiences that guarantee returns			0
’ the report says the gradual decline in numbers going to the cinema was first noticed in 2009 and it could well mean that children deprived of the chance to go to the cinema as youngsters will stay away as grow older			0
‘ in the short term , the creative side of the cinema industry in the @entity29 is unlikely to be affected by relative lack of supply			1
‘ the majority of funding for @entity29 titles comes from overseas and the @entity29 is a significant net exporter in film			0
‘ it would , however , be remiss not to ensure that the current creative vibrancy of the @entity29 ’s film production industry does not translate into a legacy of inspired younger people who wish to follow in the footsteps of great directors working in the @entity29 , as well as world - leading on - screen talent and production crews			2

average cinema ticket in the @entity29 is £ 6.53 , @entity32 prices more than £ *13*
family of four set back £ 36.40 - more than £ 50 with popcorn and travel
as fewer people go to the cinema , industry *struggles* to build new ones
