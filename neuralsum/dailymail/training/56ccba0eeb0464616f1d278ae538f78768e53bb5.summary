cowering and screaming for mercy as she is lashed dozens of times , this is the fate that awaits mother - of - two @entity5 who has been sentenced to death in @entity8 for marrying a @entity9			1
@entity5 could be given 100 lashes within days just like this woman as part of her barbaric punishment that has caused outrage worldwide , @entity15 can reveal			1
campaigners today said it could leave @entity18 scarred , humiliated and with deep psychological wounds that may never heal			0
the @entity8 government confirmed the authenticity of the video saying she was being punished under @entity33 and 155 of their penal code begging : as the end of the whip cracks against her back the woman pleads for mercy and her mother @entity5 is still recovering from giving birth to her daughter @entity43 two weeks ago in the prison in the @entity8 capital @entity46 where she has been held captive since last september			1
her son @entity47 , 20 months , has been in custody with her the whole time too			0
@entity5 , 27 , a doctor , was put on death row after being convicted of apostasy and adultery by a strict @entity53 court			2
her case has attracted the condemnation of the governments of @entity57 , the @entity58 and the @entity59 who have branded her treatment as ' barbaric '			1
the @entity8 government appeared to be on the verge of agreeing to releasing @entity5 last week under the growing international pressure - but did a dramatic u-turn			1
it is now waiting for the outcome of her appeal , which will be within the next week or two			0
international human rights organisation redress told @entity15 that pressure needed to be maintained on @entity8 to make sure that @entity5 is freed			1
@entity71 , of @entity69 , said : ' this may well be the fate that awaits @entity5 unless her appeal is successful			2
the video shows how flogging violates the dignity of its victims who are more often than not women			0
' redress calls for an end to this practice , which is cruel , inhuman and degrading			1
' the footage of the flogging was originally filmed in december 2010 and shows the woman wearing a full hijab in a public area surrounded by policemen in blue uniforms as a crowd of men look on			2
she is clearly distressed and is seen holding up her hands as she is told : ' we ’ll jail you for two years if you do n’t bend down and sit on the ground '			0
u-turn : the @entity8 government - in the face of growing international pressure - claimed that @entity5 ( being held with her baby and son @entity47 in prison ) would be released			1
that was a few weeks ago and she is still there outrage : @entity5 was sentenced to death for refusing to convert to @entity53 and 100 lashes for ' adultery ' because it is illegal in @entity8 for a @entity107 to marry a @entity9 she kneels down and begins to cry out loud , bawling as the impatient policeman says : ' sit down quickly , we want to go '			1

@entity5 ’s appeal with the court in @entity46 is ongoing and says her conviction was a breach of her right to religious freedom			2
@entity5 ’s lawyers have also filed a separate appeal with the @entity143 which does not have enforcement powers over @entity8 but can add to the international pressure were it to rule in their favour			1
@entity15 can also disclose that @entity5 ’s husband @entity148 , a naturalised @entity58 citizen , who lives in @entity149 , @entity150 , has finally met with the @entity58 embassy in @entity46			1
yet in a cruel twist they have demanded that he submit to a paternity test before they assist his children further , even though he has presented them with his marriage certificate to their mother and his passport			0
@entity148 , a biochemist , had earlier claimed that he had been ignored three times by the embassy because they were ' too busy ' to see her			0
helpless : at one point she grabs the whip but another policeman moves towards her and starts whipping too sick : the policeman laughs at the camera as the horrific spectacle unfolds and is amused it is being filmed @entity167 of @entity58 - based religious freedom campaigners hardwired said that the development was a ' slap in the face ' for him			1
@entity5 was originally thrown in jail after her half brother filed a lawsuit in @entity46 which led to the criminal charges against her			2
a judge found her guilty because he refused to recognise her 2011 marriage because her father was a @entity107			2
even though @entity5 ’s father left her family when he was six she should still worship @entity53 , the ruling said			0
during one of her court hearings @entity5 said that she was ' was never a @entity107 , i was raised a @entity9 from the start ' but it made no difference			1
@entity47 was born in @entity8 and may be entitled to @entity58 citizenship because @entity148 is a naturalized @entity58 , though the process is complicated and not certain			1
the same applies to @entity191 too and she could potentially become an @entity58			0

@entity8 should stop threatening religious freedom and fundamental human rights '			0

love : @entity5 married @entity217 , a biochemist , who lives in @entity149 , @entity150			2
he has now travelled back to @entity8 in a bid to save his wife and children fury : @entity148 is angry that the @entity222 in @entity46 have demanded he take a paternity test before they decide whether they can help his children , who would have a claim to @entity58 citizenship and @entity58 protection rep @entity230 , @entity232 , also raised it at the @entity234			1
