it said : ‘ when we launched @entity4 over three years ago , we had a lot of restrictions on what name you could use on your profile			2

’ in september last year , @entity8 changed its comment policy by switching to @entity4 comments , and comment notices to alerts users protested about the integration of @entity4 with @entity8 comments , leading to an online petition with more than 200,000 supporters			1
commenters said they were concerned about their privacy because commenting with a @entity4 profile would reveal their identity .			2

in 2011 , @entity1 insisted all @entity4 users registered using their real name
one reason was to *prevent* commenters posting abuse anonymously
a *similar* restriction was extended to @entity8 last year
@entity1 has now removed all restrictions on what names can be used
it could lead to abusive comments to increase on @entity4 and @entity8
