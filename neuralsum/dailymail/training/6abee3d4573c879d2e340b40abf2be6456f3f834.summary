by @entity0 published : 11:58 est , 11 august 2013 updated : 04:15 est , 12 august 2013 stroll : new @entity3 governor @entity2 strolls through the crowds at the @entity6 festival in @entity7 with his wife @entity8 in his lilac polo shirt , crumpled shorts and suede loafers , new @entity3 governor @entity2 was wearing the burdens of office remarkably lightly at the weekend			1
the dressed - down 48 - year - old made fixing the economy look like a walk in the park as he strolled through the crowds at a music festival in @entity7 with his wife @entity8			1
at one point he lay back on the grass with his hands behind his head and seemed to be doing a stretching exercise as he listened to a band			0
the @entity28 ’s casual outfit might have come straight from the @entity30 guide to chillaxing			0
the prime minister was spotted in similar attire on holiday in @entity34 last month			0
with hopeful signs on the economy and the best summer weather for years , mr @entity2 could perhaps be forgiven for making the most of his time off			2
he was at the @entity6 festival in the 1,700 - acre grounds of the @entity43 estate near @entity44			1
known as ‘ @entity45 ’ , the festival is an hour ’s drive from the @entity47 ’ £ 15,000 - a - month taxpayer - funded @entity49 home , and features a luxury spa , gourmet food and heated yurts			1
unlike the rest of the 15,000 revellers enjoying the £ 146 - a - head festival this weekend , the @entity47 were not glamping under the stars , but staying in the manor house itself - the home of mrs @entity60 ’s sister , lady @entity59			1
the 17th - century building is the ancestral seat of @entity63 , the 3rd @entity64 , a conservative hereditary peer who married @entity59 in 2000			0
the @entity67 famously play host to the powerful @entity7 set including @entity30 and @entity70 - who have attended festivals at @entity43 in the past - and @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity75			1
chilling out : at one point mr @entity2 lay back on the grass in @entity7 with his hands behind his head mr @entity2 appeared to be doing a sit - up or stretching exercise at one point while listening to a band on stage at one point @entity60 seemed to walk off before a seemingly playful mr @entity2 ran after her and gave her a hug looking good : with hopeful signs on the economy and the best summer weather for years , mr @entity2 could perhaps be forgiven for making the most of his time off accommodation : the @entity47 were not glamping under the stars , but staying in the @entity43 manor house itself - the home of mrs @entity96 s sister , lady @entity59 mr @entity2 and his wife have stayed at @entity43 several times			1
it is said they usually stay in the opulent four - poster bed @entity102 bedroom			0
leaving the cool dark rooms of the manor house this weekend , the @entity47 , accompanied by their young daughters and other friends , sauntered past tents of middle - class revellers enjoying yoga classes , spa treatments and martial arts			1
dressed down : prime minister @entity30 and his wife @entity112 on holiday in @entity34 last month mr @entity2 , who was known by @entity28 as the ‘ rock - star banker ’ for his economic abilities , told the @entity116 he was having ‘ a very good time ’ as he listened to acapella beatbox quartet @entity118 perform a rendition of recent number one smash hit get lucky by electronic band @entity123			2
food at the festival was provided on long table banquets at £ 40 a head , cooked up by trendy celebrity chefs @entity129 and @entity130			0
headlining on stage were folk singer @entity132 , piano man of the moment @entity133 and rock band @entity135			0
mr @entity2 - who last week criticised self - obsessed bankers who are so detached from reality have become ‘ socially useless ’ - met his wife @entity8 when he was studying for his doctorate at @entity140			1
she is an outspoken economist and environmental campaigner who was born in @entity142 to a pig farmer and attended £ 31,000 - a - year @entity144 in @entity145			0
mr @entity2 , a former £ 1million - a - year @entity146 banker , was poached by chancellor @entity147 from the @entity148 for a five - year term			2
he was lured from @entity28 with an £ 874,000 pay packet - about £ 100,000 more than predecessor sir @entity151 earned - which includes a £ 250,000 - a - year housing allowance , or £ 4,800 a week			0
after tax , it works out as £ 11,041 a month towards his rent which is believed to be nearly £ 15,000 per month			0
the two younger @entity2 children have enrolled in a local junior school and the elder two are going to different secondary schools - all fee - paying establishments which will cost their parents £ 18,970 per term			2
last week , in an unprecedented action of ‘ forward guidance ’ , mr @entity2 confirmed interest rates would be held at their current record low of 0.5 per cent for the next three years or more - spelling more pain for savers until at least 2016 .			2

@entity2 , 48 , was at @entity6 in @entity7 with wife @entity8
they were among 15,000 revellers enjoying £ 146 - a - head weekend event
