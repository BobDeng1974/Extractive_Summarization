we see @entity1 on tv adverts and billboards , promoting bank accounts , health insurance and sportswear			2
it is easy to forget we have not seen her on the athletics track for more than 18 months and it has been more than two - and - a - half years since she won @entity11 gold on a mild summer evening in @entity13 , her most recent heptathlon			1
her management team have done a stellar job maintaining her profile during the 18 months she has been away from competition , during which time she had her first baby , @entity20			1
@entity1 celebrates her triumph at @entity22 - but she is more likely to be seen in adverts of late the @entity11 heptathlon champions is working under the guidance of long - time coach @entity26 @entity27 , 10,000m won gold at @entity29 in 1991 , less than a year after she gave birth to daughter @entity31			1
@entity32 , @entity33 had daughter @entity35 in february 2007 and won @entity34 later that year			0
@entity36 , 10,000m had the best season of her career in 2014 , culminating in @entity41 gold 10 months after having second child @entity42			1
@entity43 , @entity44 became the first @entity45 to win the @entity46 , just 10 weeks after having her second child			0
@entity48 , @entity49 won the @entity50 in 2009 , just a couple of years after retiring to start a family			2
but with the announcement that she will make her comeback in the 100 metres hurdles at the @entity56 in @entity57 on may 9 come the inevitable questions			0
can she recapture the form that put her on top of the world and does her future status as @entity65 ’s golden girl depend on it ? at the @entity66 in @entity67 , she is working her socks off under the guidance of long - time coach @entity70 , who is learning new things every day about working with an athlete who has recently given birth			1
he is broadly optimistic but cautions against expecting too much from her immediately			0
‘ she ’s a couple of months behind where she needs to be so we ’re just building back steadily , ’ he said			2
‘ it ’s going to be a very big challenge and i would n’t expect huge things straight away			0
but she ’s getting back to where she was in terms of some of the markers we ’ve put down			0
’ back when @entity89 won @entity11 gold , a 19 - year - old @entity88 was 15th , just happy to share a start line with her compatriot			1
now 22 , @entity88 is the world ’s best multi-eventer and broke @entity89 ’s @entity65 pentathlon record in @entity96 this month			1
asked if it was unfair to expect @entity98 to match @entity88 , who has already broken three national records this season , @entity70 was coy			1
‘ you ’re talking about competing with the world ’s no 1 , ’ he said			0
‘ ask me in june and i ’d be able to tell you better			0
’ @entity89 has not competed since finishing fourth in the 100m hurdles at the @entity106 in 2013 @entity88 is the best multi-eventer around and has broken the @entity65 pentathlon record when asked if @entity89 could compete with @entity88 , @entity70 said : ‘ ask me in june ' @entity89 has not competed since finishing fourth in the 100m hurdles at the @entity110 in july 2013			1
an achilles tendon injury ruled her out of the @entity29 in @entity113 that summer			0
she continued to train during her pregnancy but it was n’t until october last year that she returned to the gym , three months after giving birth.the idea that pregnancy somehow benefits female athletes is compelling			2
there are several examples of women reaching the pinnacle of their sport for the first time or recapturing former glory after having children			2
@entity32 was running again 12 days after giving birth in 2007 and won the @entity34 later that year			0
last year mother of two @entity36 won 10,000m gold at the @entity41 10 months after giving birth to @entity42			1
@entity36 later told me the challenges of being a mother far outweigh the benefits			0
‘ i know people say it ’s a physiological advantage , ’ she said			0
‘ but you have nine months of deconditioning and end it all with a childbirth and while recovering you ’re in a breastfeeding state and having no sleep for months			2
that ca n’t be beneficial to an athletic performance in the near future			0
’ @entity70 has noticed some benefits in endurance work but the negatives in terms of explosive power needed for multi-eventing are more obvious			1
@entity32 was running again 12 days after giving birth in 2007 and later won the @entity34 marathon @entity36 won 10,000m gold at the @entity41 10 months after giving birth to daughter @entity42 although @entity89 will join @entity88 in @entity57 , the first time the pair will go head - to - head will be in @entity159 , @entity160 later in the month			1
@entity88 ’s coach @entity161 said they were ‘ neutral ’ about the potential rivalry , saying : ‘ i adore @entity164 but i can understand why the wider world is fascinated by their match - up and rightly so			1
‘ if @entity164 can recapture almost her best that would leave them on a fairly even keel			0
if @entity164 was in @entity171 shape , she would have the edge but if she ’s 100 points off and @entity174 is at her best it would go down to the wire in the 800m ( the final event of the heptathlon )			0
’ @entity70 instructs @entity89 at the @entity178 back in 2012 and is hoping to bring her back to the top @entity89 and @entity88 will go head - to - head will be in @entity159 , @entity160 later in may @entity182 , of @entity183 , claimed the pair are unlikely to directly compete for advertisers ’ money			1
‘ @entity164 can play it smartly by supporting @entity174 as her successor , ’ he said			0
‘ performance on the track is critical because you can only maintain a profile based on personality alone for so long			1
but if @entity164 does n’t repeat the success to the same level as before , she has cemented herself in the public eye enough to focus on off - track opportunities			2
’ if she plays her cards right , though , @entity89 could write one of the great sporting comeback stories			2
@entity182 , of @entity183 , claimed @entity89 and @entity88 are unlikely to directly compete for advertisers ’ money with each other ahead of the comeback of the former			1

@entity89 has not been seen on the athletics track for over 18 months
it is over two - and - a - half years since her @entity11 gold at @entity22
@entity89 is working towards return with long - time coach @entity70
he says he will not compare her with @entity88 yet
@entity89 is looking to join a list of successfully returning mothers
