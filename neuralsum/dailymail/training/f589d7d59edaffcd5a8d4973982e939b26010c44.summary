a silent electric bike is to be used by police forces as a means to approach criminals undetected			1
@entity4 in northern @entity5 have designed their a motorcycle that law enforcement officials can use to get the upper hand on criminals			1
and with a top speed of up to 98 miles ( 158 km ) per hour , the police of tomorrow can chase criminals down as well if the stealth approach fails			1
it takes between six and 9.9 hours to charge depending on the model and weighs up to 473 pounds ( 215 kg ) zero motorcycles are known for their range of bikes for personal use , but this range is the first that has been developed for use by police forces			0
it follows in the footsteps of a similar bike , the @entity28 , which is an off - road bike designed for use by the military in addition to the police			2
top speed : 98 miles ( 158 km ) per hour range * : up to 151 miles ( 243 km ) charging time * : between six and 9.9 hours weight * : 396 to 473 pounds : ( 180 to 215 kg ) equivalent fuel economy : 408 miles to the gallon ( 0.58 litres per 100 km ) cost to recharge * : $ 0.96 to $ 1.60 * depending on model this police bike , however , is intended to be used by law enforcement in urban locations and , owing to its silent engine , it could enable them to be safer and more discreet while on the job			1
according to @entity50 the @entity49 ( @entity49 ) is evaluating the use of such electric motorcycles for its officers			2
' there are quite a few attributes that make these bikes appealing to the police and military , ' @entity55 , chief technology officer for @entity4 , told @entity50			2
‘ they ’re quiet ; they ’re very stealthy			0
’ the motorcycle is silent to it can be used to creep up on criminals undetected			1
the @entity49 is evaluating the vehicle for use by its officers on the city streets ( shown ) there are two bikes being rolled out for law enforcement services : the @entity71 and the @entity72			1
the former is intended solely for street usage , while the later can be used both on and off road			0
with a range of 164 miles ( 264 km ) on one charge , the city bike should suit police operating in urban environments quite comfortably			2
each bike is devoid of a loud and polluting combustion engine , meaning they can creep up on people without alerting them or enter a dangerous location undetected			0
the matter of cost is also important : after the initial outlay , upwards of £ 10,650 ( $ 17,900 ) , it is said a single charge costs about 60p ( $ 1 ) ‘ there are major benefits to incorporating these environmentally friendly motorcycles , ’ said officer @entity90 of the @entity91 in a statement			0
‘ it costs less than 50 cents to charge compared to using gallons of gas , maintenance is simple , and the community appreciates how quiet they are			0
’ ‘ most importantly , our officers have an added tactical advantage while on patrol			0
’ the bike boasts a top speed of 98 mph and has a range of more than 150 miles			1
there are two models available for police officials , one just for street use ( shown ) and another for on and off - road driving and it ’s not just the police that are taking note of the bike - a military version called the @entity28 is also garnering attention			1
designed for more rugged use off - road , the bike boasts two separate batteries than can easily be replaced and a simple electric motor drive			1
and it even has an ‘ override ’ switch , that can be pressed when a biker is in danger such as being shot at			0
this will nullify any safety systems allowing for extra speed , albeit at the risk of damaging the bike			0
it ’s also equipped with infrared lights for night vision			2
for the police and military of the future , it might be bikes like these that give them the edge when it comes to stopping criminals			0
the bike is designed to enable law enforcement to be more discreet in their actions			0
the @entity49 are currently evaluating the vehicle ( press image shown ) to see if it has a place in their fleet a military version called the @entity28 ( shown ) is also garnering attention			1
