mystery surrounds how @entity2 's most sophisticated spy plane was captured by @entity3 after it was paraded on @entity3 state television yesterday in near mint condition			1
the @entity6 claims the lost @entity7 was on a surveillance mission last week when it was detected by @entity3 over @entity9 and was downed by their armed forces			1
but the drone appears to be in good shape , contradicting @entity3 's claim it was shot down - and backing up @entity2 claims that @entity14 did not bring it down through electronic , cyber or any other means			1
' yep , that 's it - it 's intact , ' a source told @entity32			0
' this is a big prize in terms of technology			0
' meanwhile the official added that president @entity37 decided not to retrieve or destroy the drone because that could have been seen as an act of war			1
@entity2 officials have admitted the drone was lost on a mission last week , but say it was probably because of a malfunction on board			1
they also pointed out it would have probably been badly damaged - and therefore less sensitive - if it had fallen from a height of up to 50,000ft			0
however the video shows the drone pretty much intact			0
the tour of the drone on @entity53 is clearly political maneuvering by @entity3 as the @entity2 tries to find out more about the country 's nuclear programme			1
military officials : these images give more credence to @entity3 's claims of having the highly - sensitive drone unhappy : @entity3 claims the drones are a violation of its sovereignty and feel they are an aggressive act against them by the @entity2 @entity3 claims the drones are a violation of its sovereignty and feels they are an aggressive act against them , reported @entity72			1
but the @entity2 said earlier this week the drone was only supposed to fly over @entity74 looking for insurgents then flew off course			0
@entity2 officials are concerned about the @entity3 potentially sharing or selling what they could have recovered of the aircraft to @entity25 or @entity26			1
these fears will be heightened following the broadcast , as it shows the cream - coloured drone seemingly intact despite its crash			2
@entity53 also reported that @entity3 will now ‘ carry out reverse engineering ’ on the drone , which was manufactured by @entity85			0
graphic : the @entity7 was reportedly used to watch former @entity88 leader @entity87 during the @entity90 mission that killed him the @entity7 was used to watch former @entity88 leader @entity87 during the @entity90 mission that killed him , reported @entity91			0
meanwhile a senior @entity2 official claimed any capture shines a light on the @entity2 spying mission , but will not tell @entity3 much it did not already know			2
experts and officials acknowledge that there is no self - destruct mechanism on the @entity100 , which are used both by the military and the @entity102			2
this is bound to raise questions about why an aircraft would be developed that stays intact when it crashes and could get into anybody 's hands			2
@entity3 state radio reported on wednesday that the country would soon broadcast video footage of the downed drone			0
it was shown on thursday			0

images on @entity3 's @entity118 lost @entity7
@entity2 had not *previously* *verified* whether @entity3 got drone
officials claimed it would have been damaged in a crash
but pictures *suggest* their high - tech drone is still intact
@entity37 decides not to retrieve drone to avoid ' act of war '
questions over why aircraft did not self - destruct in crash
