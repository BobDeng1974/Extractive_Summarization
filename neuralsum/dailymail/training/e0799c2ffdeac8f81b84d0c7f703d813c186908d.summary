by @entity0 published : 06:14 est , 4 may 2012 updated : 07:11 est , 4 may 2012 fans of new @entity3 film @entity2 in the @entity4 have been bombarding the country 's tourist board with requests to try out its angling scene			1
@entity4 officials have been ' inundated ' with queries from people hoping to visit since the film 's release - despite the fact the country is the scene of major unrest and does not have a climate suited to salmon fishing			1
@entity22 's @entity21 has warned against all travel to @entity4 , which lies on the @entity24 , citing ' violent clashes , a threat of kidnap by armed tribes , criminals and terrorists and activity by @entity32			1
' fantasy : @entity2 in the @entity4 follows @entity34 actor @entity3 as dr @entity35 , who is asked to introduce salmon fishing to the rivers of @entity4 by a wealthy sheikh played by @entity39 but the @entity40 said the advice from the @entity21 was ' excessive ' and that some parts were ' very hospitable '			1
@entity40 today insisted there were ' lots of similarities ' between the @entity24 country and @entity34 , where the rest of the film is set			1
' we 're definitely looking to build some sort of connection between the two countries following the film , said @entity22 spokesman @entity54			0
' one negative is that salmon fishing is n't actually that popular in @entity4 , but there are excellent sea fishing opportunities in the country			1
' the film , based on the popular book by @entity62 , follows @entity63 as dr @entity35 , who is asked to introduce salmon fishing to the rivers of @entity4 by a wealthy sheikh			2
mr @entity54 insisted the country was ' somewhere @entity34 people might enjoy ' , adding : ' the bagpipes are popular in @entity4 , and they also have their very own version of haggis			1
' the country of @entity4 is still very mysterious , which i think will also appeal to tourists			1
' reality : the @entity21 has warned against all travel to @entity4 , pictured , because of ' continuing unrest and violent clashes , a threat of kidnap by armed tribes , criminals and terrorists and activity by @entity32 ' the @entity22 @entity21 last month issued a red warning over the @entity4 , telling visitors to ' avoid all travel to the whole country '			1
direct cargo and passenger flights from @entity4 to the @entity22 were suspended for security reasons two years ago following a failed attempt to bomb an aircraft			2
the @entity21 website warns of the danger of reprisal attacks against westerners following the killing of @entity101 extremist @entity99			2
it warns that attacks against western and @entity22 interests could be indiscriminate , including targets such as residential compounds , military and oil facilities , and transport and aviation interests			0
the @entity111 is also warning against travel to the country			2
but mr @entity54 said : ' there 's been a real surge in visitors to our website since the film			0
there 's been thousands of visits to our website			0
' unfortunately the @entity111 is currently advising against travel to @entity4 , which we think is excessive			1
' some places are very hospitable but i would n't advise people to go to certain places at this time			0
' @entity4 was recently described as the ' poorest country in the @entity130 ' in a @entity132 review of the country , which also said it had ' become a haven for @entity136 militants			2
' @entity3 , who appears alongside @entity137 and @entity138 , said : ' we learned how to salmon fish as it 's a very particular style of fishing and it 's quite complicated to move the line through the air			0
' @entity39 , who plays the sheik , and i had to learn			0
because we are playing passionate fly fisherman			0
' at the back of my mind - as is mentioned in the film - the @entity22 fisher folk are quite a passionate bunch			0
i can imagine all of them being horrified by my fly fishing			0
i did the best i could			0

however , tourist board insists the country has many similarities with @entity34
@entity21 has warned against all travel to @entity4
