by @entity0 the @entity3 will not grant a visa to @entity6 's controversial pick for envoy to the @entity8 , the @entity2 administration said today , in a rare diplomatic rebuke			1
the @entity3 government had previously said only that it opposed the nomination of envoy @entity12 , who was a member of the group responsible for the 1979 takeover of the @entity15 in @entity6			1
@entity3 officials had hoped the issue could be resolved by @entity6 simply withdrawing the nomination			1
he was a member of the group responsible for the 1979 takeover of the @entity15 in @entity6 ' we 've communicated with the @entity22 at a number of levels and made clear our position on this - and that includes our position that the selection was not viable , ' @entity26 spokesman @entity25 said			0
' our position is that we will not be issuing him a visa			0
' denying visas to @entity8 ambassadorial nominees or to foreign heads of state who want to attend @entity8 events in the @entity3 is unusual , if not unprecedented			1
the move comes amid a possible thaw in the decades - long diplomatic freeze between the @entity3 and @entity22 , as the two countries negotiate a deal to curb @entity6 's disputed nuclear program			1
@entity12 is alleged to have participated in a @entity48 student group that held 52 @entity3 hostage for 444 days during the takeover			1
the crisis was the subject of the 2012 @entity54 - winning film @entity55			0
his nomination has outraged members of @entity58 , who passed a bill barring entry to the @entity3 to an individual found to be engaged in espionage , terrorism or a threat to national security			2
@entity25 would not say whether president @entity2 would sign the bill but said the president shares its sentiments			0
@entity8 officials had no immediate comment on the @entity3 decision			2

the fanatical followers of the @entity74 had earlier stormed the @entity3 building in @entity6 , occupied the building and took nearly 100 embassy staff and @entity78 hostages @entity22 has called @entity3 rejection of @entity12 ' not acceptable , ' with @entity22 state television quoting @entity83 spokeswoman @entity82 as saying @entity12 is one of the country 's best diplomats and arguing that he previously received a @entity3 visa			1
@entity12 has insisted his involvement in the group involved in the embassy takeover , @entity48 students following the @entity88 , was limited to translation and negotiation			2
@entity22 officials said they had submitted a visa application for @entity12 , but it was unclear whether the @entity3 actually denied the request or simply decided not to act on it			1
@entity99 spokeswoman @entity98 said the administration was prohibited from discussing the matter in detail because visa cases are confidential			0
in past problematic cases - such as with a previous @entity22 nominee in the early 1990s and more recently with @entity107 president @entity106 - the @entity3 has either signaled opposition to the applicant and the request has been withdrawn , or the @entity99 has simply declined to process the application			2
those options , as well as approving or denying the application , are available in the current case			0
@entity3 immigration law allows broad rejection of visas to foreigners and , in many cases , authorities do not have to give an explicit reason why other than to deem the applicant a threat to national security or @entity3 policy			2
the law bars foreigners whose entry or activity in the @entity3 would ' have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the @entity3 '			0
