by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 19:42 est , 23 january 2014 updated : 06:27 est , 24 january 2014 a fiercely conservative @entity5 congressman who is mounting a long - shot challenge from the right against @entity9 minority whip @entity8 has made virtually no public appearances in recent weeks as questions mount about his campaign finances			1
@entity14 @entity13 has missed 17 straight @entity16 votes since january 9 - including one on the $ 1.1 trillion omnibus federal spending package that he promised on @entity19 to vote against			1
that 's unusual since , even though @entity13 has a reputation as a @entity23 renegade , he missed only about a dozen major votes all last year			1
challenge : @entity14 congressman @entity13 's has made virtually no public appearances in recent weeks as questions mount about his campaign 's growing debts the disappearance is mystifying for conservative activists who were hoping @entity13 could help them land another blow against the @entity14 establishment this year			1
@entity5 has been a showcase for the right wing 's power since firebrand @entity37 rose from back in the party 's ranks in 2012 to become a @entity9 sensation			2
but @entity13 's challenge has slipped from quixotic to downright unusual			2
‘ he thought he was another @entity37 and he is n't , ’ said @entity42 , chairman of the @entity44 - based government is not @entity45 , which backed @entity13 's congressional campaigns in the 1990s and 2012 but has now endorsed @entity8			1
@entity13 is trying to oust senate minority whip @entity8 , left , and his supporters had hoped he could emulate the success of @entity37 , another right - wing firebrand from @entity5 once a homeless college dropout , @entity13 is a born - again @entity52 who lists his official occupation as ‘ @entity55			1
’ he served one term in @entity57 beginning in 1994 , then returned last year and has attracted attention in conservative circles with flamboyant rhetoric about impeaching president @entity61 and promoting gun rights			0
@entity13 even had a copy of the book @entity65 : the case for removing @entity67 hand - delivered to all 435 @entity16 members			1
after first dropping out of sight , the congressman recently was spotted on a visit to @entity72 as a member of the @entity74 - but where he 's gone since then is unclear			0
@entity13 's staff wo n't say where he is			0
they have ignored more than six weeks of emails , telephone messages and social media posts from @entity2 and other news outlets			0
@entity13 , right , pictured at the @entity80 on the memorials at the @entity83 @entity82 in @entity44 last october , alongside @entity84 and senator @entity37 @entity8 , seeking his third term , has a campaign that 's been more responsive : ‘ it 's up to @entity87 to decide if they think someone who does n't show up to work or adhere to election law deserves a promotion , ’ said spokesman @entity93			1
though skipping votes is n't uncommon for congressmen who are campaigning , @entity13 has n't done much campaigning , even with @entity5 ' march 4 @entity14 primary now looming			2
since suddenly withdrawing his bid for re-election to his @entity16 seat and filing against @entity8 on dec. 9 , @entity13 has made just one major public appearance in @entity5 - chastising @entity8 as too liberal before about 50 tea party activists at a north @entity104 church jan. 14			1
that followed his skipping a scheduled appearance before a larger tea party group in @entity109 , near @entity110			0
@entity111 , a board member of the @entity112 in @entity13 's district , said the congressman has been quietly courting conservative organizations and local grassroots activists			0
still , he called @entity13 's campaign ‘ a little chaotic			2
’ ‘ i would expect a more transparent staff to citizens and tea party groups , ’ @entity111 said			0
fake ? the photo , above , appears to show @entity8 with president @entity61 original : several media outlets claim the image was doctored from this 2009 photo showing @entity127 with @entity61 @entity13 's problems go beyond visibility			1
he has reported having only about $ 32,000 in cash on - hand and $ 163,000 in debts , while @entity8 's campaign fund is nearly $ 7 million			1
@entity42 , of the government is not @entity45 , said he got a call soliciting donations for @entity13 but ‘ i was so furious he was throwing away that congressional seat , i dressed them down pretty good			0
’ the anti-tax @entity139 has shunned him - after spending around $ 5.5 million to help @entity37 upset mainstream @entity14 contender @entity140 in the state 's 2012 @entity9 @entity14 primary			2
since making it back to @entity57 , @entity13 has thrived on shock - value publicity , claiming ‘ @entity150 worship abortion with the same fervor the @entity153 worshipped @entity154 ’ and offering supporters a campaign bumper sticker reading , ‘ if babies had guns , they would n't be aborted			2
’ a @entity13 campaign website suggesting that @entity8 secretly supports the @entity16 - backed health care law even doctored what appears to be an old picture of then - @entity159 gov. @entity127 beaming at the president to make it look like @entity8 was the one doing so			1
rep. @entity13 , @entity162 , right , participates in a mock swearing - in ceremony with speaker of the house rep. @entity164 , @entity166 , for the 113th @entity57 in @entity44 but investigations by the @entity168 and the watchdog @entity169 have uncovered a bevy of potential violations of @entity173 rules			0
in october , @entity13 fired two congressional staffers for making prohibited contributions to his campaign			0
some tea party groups maintain that @entity13 can still rally			0
‘ i know that @entity13 has gotten hit from multiple sides , ’ said @entity178 , political director of the @entity179 in @entity44 , ‘ but that would n't be happening if he were n't a serious threat			0
