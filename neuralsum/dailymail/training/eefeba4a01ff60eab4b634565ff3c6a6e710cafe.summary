by @entity0 last updated at 12:29 pm on 19th january 2012 @entity2 's hair is turning grey so rapidly that even the @entity4 made a joke about it on his 50th birthday last year			1
but that has n't stopped the tv advertisement of the first @entity2 / @entity11 re-election campaign from featuring a remarkably youthful - looking president with luxuriant brown hair			1
like many world leaders , mr @entity2 has aged during the three years he has been in office , a process that in his case has been most visible through his greying hair			1
a survey conducted by @entity36 and the @entity37 found that 45 per cent of voters would support mr @entity2 if the election was held now			1
mr @entity30 would also receive 45 per cent of the vote			2
but independent voters , who helped propel mr @entity2 to victory in the 2008 election , could be an obstacle in his bid for a second term in the @entity34			1
a majority of independent voters have soured on mr @entity2 's presidency , disapprove of his handling of the economy and do not have a clear idea of what he hopes to accomplish if re-elected , the @entity37 reported			1
only 31 per cent of independent voters have a favourable opinion of the president and two - thirds say he has not made real progress in fixing the economy , the @entity37 reported			0
in 2008 , @entity2 won support from 52 per cent of independent voters , compared with 44 per cent who supported @entity31 presidential nominee @entity63			1
the president launched his first television ad of his re-election campaign , a 30 - second spot , yesterday			0
it defends his energy record against criticism from a @entity31 - leaning outside group in a sign that the presidential race is entering a new phase even though @entity31 have yet to pick a challenger			0
the commercial responds to a $ 6million ad campaign by a group backed by the billionaire @entity79 brothers accusing mr @entity2 of conducting pay - for - play politics in the bankruptcy of @entity84 energy company @entity83 , which imploded despite a $ 528million federal loan			1
the @entity2 ad opens by citing ' secretive billionaires attacking president @entity2 with ads fact - checkers say are not tethered to the facts '			1
it says that the president has added 2.7million clean energy jobs while reducing the nation 's dependence on foreign oil , calling mr @entity2 's record on ethics ' unprecedented '			1
the voiceover ends by saying : ' president @entity2			1
kept his promise to toughen ethics rules and strengthen @entity103 's energy economy			0
' the @entity2 campaign has bought ad time in @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 and @entity111 and on national cable television , according to a campaign official , who spoke on the condition of anonymity			1
the president 's advisers are moving to directly rebut attacks from @entity31 presidential candidates who have assailed mr @entity2 in early voting states such as @entity111 , @entity121 and @entity122			2
the ad comes in the aftermath of his decision to reject a job - producing oil pipeline running from @entity126 through @entity127 , citing environmental and public safety concerns			0
it will be coupled with stepped - up travel surrounding next tuesday 's @entity131			0
the president heads to @entity133 later today and then visits five states over three days next week to discuss the policies he will pursue leading up to his re-election campaign			0
the president 's advisers had anticipated a lengthy fight in the @entity31 primaries , but the decision to begin airing ads reflects the need to respond to criticism from outside @entity31 groups and prepare for a campaign against @entity30			0
the former @entity147 governor has won contests in @entity111 and @entity121 and shown strength in upcoming contests in @entity122 and @entity133 , giving him an inside track to the nomination			0
by the end of last year , mr @entity2 had raised more than $ 220million for his campaign and the @entity155 , giving him a strong foundation to run a national campaign across the airwaves and on the ground			2
greying , greying , gone : mr @entity2 meets with @entity160 at the @entity34 on tuesday first family : mr @entity2 and his wife @entity163 ( left ) and daughter @entity162 ( second left ) join volunteers in a library at @entity166 , in @entity28 on monday in the @entity131 , mr @entity2 is expected to draw parallels to a speech he delivered in @entity169 in december , when he said the nation 's middle - class and those aspiring to the middle - class faced ' a make - or - break moment ' and the nation needed economic policies that would give everyone a ' fair shot and a fair share '			2
the president will discuss proposals from the address in @entity183 , @entity111 , and @entity184 , @entity185 , on january 25 and in @entity186 , @entity187 , and @entity188 , @entity189 , the following day			0
on january 27 , mr @entity2 will speak in @entity190 , @entity106			2
all five states are considered critical to mr @entity2 's re-election			2
he won the @entity111 caucuses in 2008 , sending him on a path to the @entity34 , but the state looks like a toss - up this year			0
@entity189 , @entity187 and @entity185 are three @entity198 states the president 's campaign covets , while @entity106 is expected to get ample attention from @entity31 after the economic recession hurt the state 's manufacturing base .			0

commercial appears to have reversed ageing process for @entity2
