when @entity1 and @entity2 resume hostilities on saturday afternoon with a place in the @entity6 final at stake , the match will serve as a high - profile stage for an intriguing leadership duel			1
@entity11 captains past and present will go head - to - head at @entity13			2
@entity16 v @entity14 is the subplot which may go a long way to defining this @entity20 derby			1
these are men who have both encountered turbulence in the glare of public scrutiny , but who are hugely respected within the game and revered as figureheads at their respective clubs			2
new wave : incumbent @entity11 captain @entity14 leads @entity2 into their semi-final against @entity1 clash of titans : former @entity11 skipper @entity16 takes his table - toppers into the match as favourites both wield considerable influence , though their careers are at very different stages			1
@entity16 is two or three games from retirement ; the uncertainty reflecting the winner - takes - all nature of this play - off for a place at @entity49			1
for @entity1 ’ 34 - year - old second - row forward , the end of this season could see a glorious climax to a decorated career			1
for 27 - year - old @entity14 , much lies ahead			1
as the incumbent @entity11 captain , he reinforced his status during an impressive @entity57 campaign to banish the uncertainty which had previously stalked him in the role			2
if @entity14 leads @entity2 to may 31 ’s @entity6 final , @entity11 coach @entity60 will appoint a stand - in leader for the test series opener against @entity64 in @entity65 , but the armband will be @entity14 ’s again when he is available			1
so what of this semi-final match - up ? one man with a unique perspective is @entity71 , who succeeded @entity16 as @entity11 captain in 2010 and preceded @entity14 in the job			1
@entity74 - to - head : @entity14 ( left ) and @entity16 ( right ) wield great influence on the field for their clubs @entity80 : @entity71 succeeded @entity16 and preceded @entity14 in leading @entity11 onto the field ‘ @entity16 as a captain is very similar to his character ... very intense and meticulous in his preparation , certainly when it comes to the line - out and restarts , ’ said @entity71			1
intense : @entity16 's athleticism around lineouts and restarts is second to none ‘ those are his specialist areas			2
his athleticism in those areas is still second to none			0
in terms of his work on the pitch , he is a pivotal figure for @entity1			2
i do n’t think you can compare the two in terms of the work they get through , because @entity14 ’s impact on the game in that way is far more significant than @entity16 ’s , but @entity16 is still a crucial figure			1
‘ he makes all the decisions and is the character who drives standards			0
you could see @entity14 ’s impact last weekend in the game against @entity115 when he was man of the match			2
he just gets through so much work			0
‘ he ’s not always the stand - out player and he ’s not the guy who is going to make a 50 - metre break , but he will give 100 per cent in every match			1
he ’s so valuable to the teams he plays in			0
’ there is a perception that both @entity16 and @entity14 can be categorised as players who lead by understated example , but @entity71 suggested that there are clear variations in their approach			1
‘ it will be a great battle between two contrasting individuals , ’ he said			0
‘ @entity16 is more of a talker and has been a leader for a long time now			2
when he was @entity11 captain i thought he was quite unlucky , because he actually did a brilliant job , as he does now for @entity1			1
‘ he understands the game and the areas that he can influence			0
@entity138 : @entity14 may not always be the standout but his impact on games is remarkable , says @entity71 ‘ he is certainly not a @entity142 , full of bravado , but his character has changed as captain over the years and these days he seems to be more vocal			1
if things go wrong he ’s the one pointing the finger and he also antagonises the opposition			0
‘ if either is the lead - by - example type , it is @entity14			1
he ’s not really an orator but you can definitely see his confidence has grown in the role during his tenure with @entity11			0
‘ he is making decisions quickly without relying on the other leadership guys around him so much			0
he is clear in his own mind now			0
i think he learned a massive amount from the tough times he went through after games against @entity163 and @entity164 a couple of years ago			0
he has really developed as a captain and makes good decisions now			0
’ @entity16 is often damned with faint praise , despite ringing endorsements from those he works with			2
he is regarded as a work - horse and a player ’s player , limited to low - key endeavour , but @entity1 are diminished without him , as are @entity2 without @entity14			1
‘ all the stats can be irrelevant , ’ said @entity71			0
‘ especially at club level , there are individuals in a team who are absolutely intrinsic to its success			0
a good example of that is @entity115 ’s captain , @entity183			0
he is never the stand - out player but that team would n’t be where they are without him driving standards , performance and attitudes			1
not so long ago : @entity16 in a muddied @entity11 kit alongside @entity190 in 2010 from the front : @entity14 leads @entity2 and @entity11 by example having proved himself worthy of the role ‘ guys like @entity16 and @entity195 really set the standard but that is something that might not be recognised by people outside the club			1
’ @entity14 ’s challenge was to convince sceptics he was the best candidate to wear @entity11 ’s @entity204 shirt			2
he has tackled that task with defiant gusto , in the same way that a previous , acclaimed openside for the national team once did			0
‘ early on , he was n’t considered really to be an international player and he used that frustration a bit like @entity213 did , ’ said @entity71			0
@entity14 has great admiration for his adversary today - praising @entity16 ’s enduring influence , longevity and professionalism , and the way he recovered from some tough times with @entity11			1
‘ i made my @entity11 debut under @entity16 , ’ he said			2
‘ he is a brilliant captain and a brilliant man			0
there have n’t been many line - out operators as good and to play at the top level for as long as he has shows what a good player he has been			0
‘ he was involved with @entity11 when things were n’t going so well but he has come through that and gone on to win the @entity6 with @entity1			1
now he ’s about to play in a @entity231 final			1
‘ i have a huge amount of respect for what he has achieved			0
’ that respect will be shelved for 80 minutes this afternoon			0
for all their respective qualities , only one fine leader can survive this knock - out showdown .			0

@entity1 host *harlequins* on saturday in the second @entity6 semi-final
the winner faces @entity*24*5 in the final on may 31 at @entity49
@entity16 and @entity14 are hugely influential players for their sides
@entity251 will retire after the @entity231 against @entity252 on may *24* or the @entity6 final should they beat @entity2
both players *overcame* *criticism* to be highly regarded in their roles
@entity60 will name a stand - in captain for the first test in @entity64 , but should @entity2 lose the semi it will be his again
