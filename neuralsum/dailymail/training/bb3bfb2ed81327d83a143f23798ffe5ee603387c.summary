in the 007 spy films , @entity1 ’s driving passions are deadly weapons , fast cars and faster women			1
but according to a job advert placed by @entity9 yesterday , the world of espionage is rather more mundane			1
the @entity9 says it wants ‘ empathetic ’ recruits who are ‘ able to get on with diverse groups of people ’			1
in its advert , reproduced above , @entity9 proudly displays its equality credentials by carrying a @entity17 gay rights logo			1
anyone interested in ‘ guns and fast cars ’ need not apply			0
the details are included in an advert for intelligence officer posts , published yesterday in the @entity24 newspaper			0
the officers collect , analyse and report secret intelligence material from around the world			0
the job advert – presented as a flowchart – has questions including ‘ do you want to protect your country ? ’ , ‘ do you have an instinctive curiosity ? ’ and ‘ can you be trusted ? ’			0
applicants are also asked about their language skills and whether they want to carry out work overseas			0
hopefuls must say if they are male or female before being told their gender does not matter			0
the same goes for sexuality and ethnicity – although candidates must have @entity43 nationality			0
secrecy is a key issue naturally			0
anyone answering yes to the question ‘ would you tell anyone else about your application ? ’ is told ‘ thank you for your time ’			0
an identical response is given to anyone believing that @entity9 is ‘ all guns and fast cars ’			1
where @entity1 routinely defies his bosses and breaks the rules , the @entity9 advert warns against the idea that @entity43 must be protected ‘ by any means possible ’			1
@entity9 headquarters on the south bank of the @entity64 at @entity65 @entity9 has signed up to @entity17 ’s diversity champions programme , which aims to make workplaces ‘ gay friendly ’ and ensure employers comply with equalities legislation			1
the advert states : ‘ the service strives for diversity in the workplace and is committed to the creation and maintenance of a climate in which all staff are treated fairly on the grounds of merit and ability			1
’ last year @entity82 , the sister agency responsible for protecting @entity43 against foreign and domestic enemies , came 25th in the list of @entity17 ’s top 100 gay - friendly employers			1
the scene from @entity87 where @entity89 's villain @entity87 undoes the shirt worn by @entity1 , played by @entity91 , and touches him on his chest and thighs both agencies ’ attitudes to gay employees have changed markedly in a short period			2
until the mid- 1990s , homosexuals were banned from sensitive posts in the diplomatic or security services , on the grounds that they were more vulnerable to blackmail			0
two members of the @entity104 , the notorious ring of communist spies who worked for the @entity107 in the 1940s and 50s , were gay			2
@entity109 , who worked for the @entity110 and @entity9 , lived with a boyfriend even after he defected to @entity112 in 1951			1
@entity113 , an @entity82 officer and leading art historian , also had a secret gay life			2
the most recent @entity1 film , @entity87 , raised eyebrows among critics with a highly charged gay ‘ flirtation ’ scene			2
bond baddie @entity87 , played by @entity89 , undoes @entity1 ’s shirt , and strokes his chest and legs while he is tied to a chair , suggestively saying ‘ first time for everything ? ’ @entity91 , who stars as @entity1 , replies : ‘ what makes you think this is my first time ? ’			2
