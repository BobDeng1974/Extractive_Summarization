' when she confronted him about the rumours , he ' laughed them off ' , reacting ' as expected with a well - rehearsed speech : " it goes with the territory "			1
' ' he was dismissive , as if what i was saying was ridiculous , ' she said			0
' he went on to tell me an anecdote about how he had been to give music lessons in a @entity261 junior school and , some time later , two little girls aged about 11 , knocked on the door of his flat and he let them in , gave them a cup of tea and sent them home			2
' he said : " it was the stupidest thing i ever did as one of their dads came round threatening to kill me "			0
' and @entity257 has her own memories of encounters which now seem chilling			0
