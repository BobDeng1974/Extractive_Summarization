the most likely cause of the deadly outbreak of @entity3 in @entity4 was a young boy playing near a colony of virus - infected bats nestled in a hollowed - out tree , scientists believe			1
the two - year - old boy - described as the index case , or patient zero - became infected and was the first to die in his village in @entity14 , guinea in december last year			1
it is thought ' patient zero ' was @entity18 , described as a playful toddler by his father @entity20			0
before his death , on december 6 , 2013 , @entity18 had been near a tree harbouring the free - tailed bats			1
the toddler came down with a sky - high fever , began vomiting and passing black stools			0
their mother and grandmother followed , becoming infected with the disease it took four days for the disease to claim @entity18 's life , and he passed away on december 6 , 2013			0
his sister @entity47 fell ill on christmas day last year , and was dead before @entity48			0
their mother followed , along with their grandmother , @entity20 said earlier this year			0
the disease then spread to other members of the community before spreading to other parts of @entity29			0
the disease was only recognised as @entity3 in march , and in the summer it began to spread across international borders , infecting people in @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70 , before patients were diagnosed in @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity74			0
the epidemic represents the largest ever - recorded @entity3 outbreak , killing 7,800 people by december 17 , 2014			0
@entity20 said his son died on december 6 , 2013 , four days after first falling ill fruit bats are the commonly suspected carriers of the ebola virus and have been linked to previous outbreaks in @entity4			1
they are often hunted for food , but scientists say they are an unlikely source of infection			2
this is because food - borne transmission would have affected adults before or at the same time as the two - year - old boy			1
this suggested a source of infection unrelated to food - that the boy somehow came into contact with the insect - eating free - tailed bats			1
researchers from the @entity100 in @entity101 were part of a team which took part in a four - week field mission in @entity29 in april 2014			0
this was to examine human exposure to bats , to survey local wildlife and to capture and sample bats in @entity14 and in neighbouring forests			2
however the village where the boy died was not located in the forest			2
instead , the source of the infection was probably a large colony of free - tailed insectivorous bats occupying a hollow tree , they concluded			1
villagers reported that children often used to play in and around the tree and may have resulted in a massive exposure to the bats			2
@entity18 was from the village of @entity126 in @entity29 , pictured			0
from there the disease spread to other parts of the country as well as neighbouring @entity68 and @entity69 researcher dr @entity131 said ebola virus disease epidemics are transmitted to human populations either through contact with larger wildlife or by direct contact with bats			1
writing in the journal @entity139 he said : ' we monitored the large mammal populations close to the index village @entity14 in south - eastern @entity29 and found no evidence for a concurrent outbreak			1
' instead , a more plausible source of the outbreak was contact with bats rather than larger wildlife .			2

the two - year - old boy is described as the index case - or patient zero
became infected and was the first to die in his village in @entity14 , guinea
had been playing near a tree harbouring the free - tailed bats before he died
fruit bats are the commonly suspected carriers of the ebola virus
but scientists say free - tailed bats are much more likely source of infection
