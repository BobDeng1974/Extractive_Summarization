tributes : married father - of - two sergeant @entity17 , 29 , and private @entity31 , 18 , were shot dead in the south of @entity35 - e @entity34 district , @entity37 province the move , which could jeopardise the @entity41 - led coalition 's key goal to get @entity5 forces ready to take over security from foreign forces by the end of 2014 , is intended to lower the risk of insider attacks and reduce local tensions over an anti-islam video that prompted protests in @entity5			1
sergeant @entity17 , 29 – who leaves a wife , @entity52 , and two children , @entity54 , ten , and @entity55 , four – and @entity16 were due home within days			0
the deaths prompted a furious reaction from mps and relatives yesterday – who demanded that troops were brought home from an ‘ unwinnable war ’			2
special : @entity31 was a much - loved young man who was tragically killed in @entity5 heartbroken : @entity31 's parents @entity66 and @entity68 display photographs , cards and flowers in their home in rememberence of their much loved son family : @entity31 with his mother @entity66 , father @entity68 and sister @entity76 prince @entity79 was moved to a guarded location during a recent @entity82 attack on @entity83 , the @entity78 has revealed			1
@entity84 had earlier told the @entity85 that captain @entity86 - as @entity79 is known to the @entity88 - was never in danger although he was present during the assault on @entity83 last friday			1
he later explained that the 28 - year - old is being protected by ' additional security arrangements ' as he carries out his second tour of duty in @entity5			2
speaking on @entity96 's @entity95 last night , he said : ' clearly there are fall - back plans and i ca n't go into the detail of them - but once we knew on friday night that the perimeter at @entity83 had been breached he would have been moved to a secure position under effective guard			1
' asked by presenter @entity106 if that meant prince @entity79 was not treated the same as every other soldier , the @entity78 said : ' you asked me whether he was at any greater risk			1
' and i 've told you that in combat he 's at the same risk as any other @entity115 pilot			0
' clearly if we had a vip in theatre and frankly if i was there or , @entity106 , if you were there in @entity83 and there was a breach of the perimeter security , anybody who might , by nature of who they are , be a target , they would be put in a secure location			2
' he added : ' he is serving there as an ordinary officer but clearly there are additional security arrangements in place that recognise that he could be a target himself specifically as a result of who he is			0
' @entity143 security forces have carried out 37 attacks this year , killing 51 coalition troops			2
the toll includes nine @entity11 servicemen – a quarter of the 35 killed in 2012 – and part of an overall @entity11 casualty toll of 430			0
last night it was claimed the gunman in the latest case was related to a @entity82 leader – again highlighting gaping flaws in vetting @entity5 recruits			1
as tributes were paid to the latest victims : yesterday sergeant @entity17 ’s stepfather @entity158 , 58 , said @entity11 troops were fighting a ‘ losing battle ’			1
mr @entity158 , who lives with @entity17 ’s mother , @entity162 , 49 , in @entity163 , @entity164 , added : ‘ we just feel numb at the moment but it is absolutely ridiculous that our troops are still out there			2
‘ @entity17 ’s death just shows that these people do n’t want us there and as soon as we leave the @entity82 will be back in power			2
this war is totally and utterly pointless			0
’ sergeant @entity17 is from @entity175 , @entity176 , and his young comrade is from @entity178 , @entity179			0
both belonged to @entity181 , the @entity182			2
building up the @entity183 to a strength of 370,000 is the key plank of @entity21 ’s strategy for withdrawing combat troops from the conflict			2
tough to take : proud @entity11 soldier @entity17 , left , who has had many glowing tributes including from his step father @entity190 , right past memories : @entity7 ( right ) is pictured aged 14 with his best friend and fellow army cadet , @entity194 tragic loss : sergeant @entity17 's children @entity54 and @entity55 tribute pictures : @entity7 , who died at the age of 18 , photographed ( left ) as a schoolboy and ( right ) as a baby international soldiers are training and mentoring @entity5 forces so they can assume responsibility for the country ’s security by the end of 2014			1
to build bonds between the forces , they live , work and sleep together in small bases			0
but the danger has increased as insurgents have infiltrated the @entity5 ranks and the @entity82 has encouraged them to kill their international mentors to undermine the mission			1
in march six 3 @entity217 soldiers died after a roadside bomb blew up their warrior armoured vehicle – the @entity88 ’s worst single loss of life in the war			0

he just wanted to be in the @entity88			0
it ’s all he ever wanted to do			0
’ in a statement to the @entity85 , mr @entity84 admitted the rapid expansion of the @entity183 meant vetting ‘ might not have been entirely adequate ’			1
all @entity5 soldiers and policemen are undergoing a stringent re-screening programme when they return from leave , said mr @entity84			1
but he acknowledged it was impossible to ‘ eliminate the risk entirely ’			0
former @entity254 minister @entity253 said : ‘ why are we still allowing our soldiers to be sacrificed to no evident purpose ? ’ he said @entity11 forces were dying in ‘ an unwinnable conflict for an unobtainable end , to no strategic benefit for our country ’			1
colonel @entity263 , a former commanding officer of the @entity264 the @entity265 , said : ‘ we have expanded very rapidly the @entity266 and the net effect is that people who would not otherwise have been put in uniform , the undesirables , have been admitted			2

**defence** **secretary** : prince @entity79 was moved to a guarded location during a recent @entity82 attack on @entity83
**defence** **secretary** @entity84 admitted checks on @entity5 joining the police and army had been ‘ *inadequate* ’ . he acknowledged @entity82 had infiltrated the @entity266 to carry out attacks ;
security has been stepped up at @entity83 , where *helicopter* pilot @entity79 is based , after friday ’s attack by gunmen which left two @entity228 dead and five @entity11 troops injured .
the term green on blue refers to a colour - coding system used by the @entity41 *military* . @entity21 forces are blue and @entity5 are green , hence the term for friendly - fire *incidents* as ‘ @entity316 ’ . the enemy is usually denoted as red .
