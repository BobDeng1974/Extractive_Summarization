by @entity0 @entity1 : 17:00 est , 28 december 2013 @entity2 : 17:00 est , 28 december 2013 whether you ’re the ‘ nominated driver ’ , are avoiding drink for medical reasons or simply do n’t fancy yet another hangover , sometimes staying sober is important – even on @entity8 ! if i ’m not drinking alcohol , i tend to sip apple juice topped up with sparkling water – or opt for a sparkling grape drink			1
in the past , i ’ve steered well clear of de-alcoholised wine			0
the process of removing the alcohol can result in the wine taking on a harsh edge of acidity , which can make it shocking to taste – and leave it with a shocking price tag to match			1
pop goes the sobriety ! there are plenty of low - alcohol or completely sober alternatives that will not make you feel like you belong on the kids table on @entity8 but happily , methods have moved on – and today there are some very pleasant non-alcoholic booze options			1
i ’ve checked out the main offerings in the shops – and by far and away the winning category for me is beer			2
i ’d be happy to drink one of the alcohol - free lagers i tested			1
and for those who enjoy a glass of something festive but are trying to be calorie - conscious , there are some extremely tasty low - alcohol wines			2
earlier this year i wrote about how i lost 4st by taking up running and choosing lower - alcohol wines – a large ( 250ml ) glass of @entity47 zinfandel can be more than 14.5 per cent alcohol content , adding 228 calories to your dinner			2
stay on the straight : all these drinks are non-alcoholic of almost free of alcohol unless otherwise stated those with 11 to 13 per cent have at least 30 fewer calories per glass			1
with this in mind , here is my pick of the low and no per cent tipples			0
@entity62 @entity63 pack the most punch the more the grape sits in the sun the greater the fermentation and alcohol content			2
so @entity70 and @entity47 wines are deadly , while @entity72 wines are more restrained			0
check the alcohol by volume ( @entity75 ) on the label			0
