billion - dollar movie franchises encourage production companies to cut lengthy books into multiple movies , but a new study reveals that such plot breaks drag the plot on much longer than it should			1
by taking the length of the movies in film series like @entity12 and @entity13 and then dividing it by the number of words in the original books , movies can then be compared by how much theoretical action takes place in each second of the film			1
the worst offender turned out to be film version of @entity23 , where the studio decided to split the lengthy book into three movies			2
blogger @entity27 used his analysis method on @entity29 to show that in doing so , there were only 3.12 words in the book for every second of each film			0
drawn out : @entity23 ( pictured ) had the least amount of words per second based on the length of the original book , showing that it may not have needed to be split into three different films low numbers : the three hobbit films ( though two are still yet to come out ) have far fewer words than each of @entity45 movies setting the precedent : @entity45 films had far more words per second , largely because each film was based off a single movie and not broken into multiple films since the second and third instalments have not been released , he used the length of the first film , titled @entity23 : an @entity56 , as a guidepost and divided the number of words in the book version - a whopping 95,022 - by three			1
the 3.12 words per second statistic means little until it is compared to that of the three films made as counter points to the three books in the series			0
the @entity70 had 16.59 words per second , @entity69 had 13.36 per second and @entity72 had 11.15			0
' in a strictly quantitative sense , the three @entity23 movies are laughably lacking in density of source material presented on screen compared to the three @entity45 movies , ' mr @entity27 wrote in his article on over thinking it			0
breaking down breaking @entity81 : the final @entity83 book was split into two films , but they both had a relatively high number of words per minute , which was only slightly less than the films based around one full book from shelf to screen : movie studios find it profitable to drag series on for more movies than simply the number of books written on the subject even if @entity23 was made as one film rather than three , the word cound would still be lower than its the @entity45 iterations , with a hypothetical 9.36 words per second			1
a breakdown of the word count is n't the only way to tell that the first @entity23 film felt long , as many moviegoers complained about the slow pace and how it felt as if it was purposefully stretched out to make the next to films exciting			0
' there 's no denying the majesty in @entity114 's visuals but he 's taken a relatively slim children 's book and stretched it beyond the limits , ' film critic @entity110 said			0
similar to the start : the split finale of @entity12 had more words than the first two films wordsmith : the @entity12 film series spanned a decade and had a massive following @entity23 's sparse dialogue is highlighted even more dramatically when other books that are split into two or more films			1
the final @entity12 book ' @entity12 and the @entity131 ' was broken into two films , he first of which had 11.31 words per second and the second which had 12.71			2
in a surprising twist , the final @entity83 installment - the writing for which was roundly panned - had nearly triple the number of words per second than the expected breakdown for the two - part @entity141 finale			2
hit maker : the @entity144 series is the latest situation where a popular book series has turned into cinema gold hit maker : the @entity144 series is the latest situation where a popular book series has turned into cinema gold while ' @entity13 : @entity151 ' has not yet been made , mr @entity27 subbed in the standard 120 - minute movie length to make his calculations			1
' i still think this is an interesting way to examine these book - based franchises and how they adapt source material for different media and business needs , ' mr @entity27 wrote in his article .			0

final books in popular series are often broken into more than one movie , as seen with @entity12 , @entity83 and @entity13
a new study shows that the decision to do so is largely because studios want to make as much as possible by stretching out the series
in some cases - like @entity23 , where one book will be turned into three movies - that means that there are very few words per second of film
