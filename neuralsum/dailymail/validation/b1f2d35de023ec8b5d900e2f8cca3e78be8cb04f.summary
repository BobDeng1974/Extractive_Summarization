a self - driving car is gearing up for a 3,500 - mile cross-country road trip from @entity3 to @entity4 that begins next week			1
a person will always be behind the wheel of the autonomous car , developed by @entity8 , in order to take control if there is a situation the vehicle can not handle on its own			1
the car will begin its journey on march 22 so that it can reach @entity4 in time for the @entity16			0
the autonomous vehicle will mainly stick to the highways , where it will be able to pass slower cars and maintain a safe distance from other automobiles all on its own			1
@entity8 cto @entity28 told wired the road trip will be the ' ultimate test ' for the vehicle , as it will be exposed to a ' range of driving conditions ' as well as various types of weather			1
it 's design is based on a 2014 @entity38			0
according to @entity8 officials , the road trip will be the longest automated drive ever attempted in @entity42			1
in 2010 an autonomous van created by @entity45 company @entity44 completed an 8,000 - mile journey from @entity47 to @entity48 for three months			0
unlike @entity52 's driverless car ( pictured ) , @entity50 's vehicle senors are tucked in the car 's front , rear and sides and thus can not be seen			0
although it will be the @entity8 car 's longest journey , it wo n't be its first			1
the @entity8 vehicle has driven around the company 's @entity63 office and has already completed a trip from @entity3 to @entity66			2
but the car really earned its stripes when , during a demonstration at the @entity71 @entity70 in january , it braked by itself as two drunk men stumbled into the street in front of it			0
@entity8 says the vehicle is capable of making complex decisions , like stopping and then proceeding at a four - way stop , merging onto the highway or maneuvering around a bicyclist or a trash can			2
when the car wants the driver to resume control , it uses a verbal warning and flashes lights on the dashboard			2
although most experts say a true driverless vehicle is at least a decade away , @entity8 's autonomous automobile is helping the technology look more like a regular car			2
unlike other driverless cars developed by @entity52 and @entity97 , the lidar sensors on @entity50 's vehicle are tucked in the car 's front , rear and sides and thus can not be seen			0
the car also has cameras throughout , including one that watches the driver			0
because lidar systems can cost around $ 70,000 apiece , they drive up the price of the autonomous prototypes			0
but @entity8 engineer @entity111 said one of the reasons for the road trip is to help decide what combination of sensors is best suited for the car , which will ultimately help lower costs			1
@entity8 estimates it will cost around $ 5,000 to make a vehicle almost fully autonomous by 2019			0
@entity8 cto @entity28 said the road trip would be the ' ultimate test ' for the autonomous vehicle , as it would be exposed to a ' range of driving conditions ' as well as various types of weather			1

the @entity8 car will drive eight hours a day for eight days
there will be a driver behind the wheel in case there is a situation car can not handle on its own
@entity8 said trip will be ' ultimate test ' , as car will be exposed to a range of driving conditions and weather changes
car will mainly stick to highways , where it will be able to pass slower cars and maintain a safe distance behind other automobiles all on its own
