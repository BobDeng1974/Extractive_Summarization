no one can cane it like @entity2			1
the woman ca n't even stick a detox in a luxury health resort in @entity6 for more than three days			2
if she is n't entertaining fellow passengers on @entity8 , she 's bouncing around on the beach , fag in one hand , cocktail in the other , ricocheting from party to party			1
if there was any justice in this world , she 'd be well on her way to joining @entity20 in the pantheon of had - it - all - but - partied - it - away great ex-beauties of our time			1
instead of which she still looks better than most women half her age , even when she 's at her roughest			1
following @entity2 's lead : the model manages to look good the morning after the night before those of us who are n't species supermodel have to try a little harder			1
i have a friend who swears by a mouthful of ice cubes first thing in the morning : wakes you up and de-puffs , apparently			2
my dentist , meanwhile , has some rather more scientific advice : always use ibuprofen for a hangover , never paracetamol : apparently the latter is processed via the liver , which has enough on its plate breaking down the excess alcohol			0
the ibuprofen , by contrast , leaves via the kidneys			0
so it 's true : the best way of preventing a hangover is a large glass of water and two @entity58 before bed			1
personally , i swear by milk thistle			1
i take a course of it twice a year , once in the summer and once at @entity63 , and i 'm convinced it makes a difference			0
well , it must do , because i had my liver function checked recently and it 's tip top - despite the fact that i 'm 2st overweight and partial to the odd @entity70			1
a happy liver is key to most things			0
it will clear up dark circles under the eyes , and also stop your skin from taking on that grey - ish tinge that ’s associated with the occasional bout of excess			1
it also helps things enormously if you choose your poison			0
did you know , for example , that the paler the drink , the gentler the hangover ? that 's because dark - coloured drinks - red wine , whisky , rum - contain higher levels of congeners , which are the natural by - products of fermentation , and give you hangovers			1
nutritionist @entity96 takes the sensible holistic approach			0
her response is to work on building up reserves from within through sustained healthy eating before , after and during your vacation			0
make sure your holiday diet does n't just consist of a packet of salt and vinegar crips and a slice of pizza			1
eat plenty of dark greens ( spinach , kale , broccoli etc ) , onions , garlic , tomatoes and peppers			0
all these encourage the production of glutathione in the body , a powerful antioxidant that helps support the liver			0
the other problem with having that extra tipple is that it increases inflammation in the body			0
so avoid inflammatory foods such as wheat and sugar , and fill up on things like avocado , oily fish and nuts			0
as to make - up , my biggest problem is usually bleariness from not taking off my mascara properly , sleeping in my contact lenses ( i always know it 's been a good night when i wake up able to see properly ) or stabbing myself in the eye with the cotton wool			1
for this there is really no better remedy than @entity144 straight from the fridge			0
cucumbers work , of course ; but if that 's not practical , try @entity149 ( £ 1 ) : very effective and quite possibly cheaper in the long run			1
if you 've got time , a little lie - down with an @entity154 and a cooling eye mask works wonders ( also for hay fever sufferers ) : try the @entity158 ( £ 6 ) from @entity159			2
if you 're beach - bound , you probably wo n't feel like caking much on the day after - @entity2 certainly does n't bother			1
a quick slap in the chops with something invigorating always helps , though , to wit @entity164 's @entity163 ( from £ 8.50 )			2
it 's the eucalyptus in this that does it for me			2
finally , for those with deep pockets , @entity173 's @entity172 ( £ 70 ) is the actual product that the actual @entity2 uses			1
@entity173 being @entity2 's go - to make - up artist , she has plenty of experience of being handed a weary , worn - out party girl and transforming her into a hot - to - trot supermodel			1
then it 's just a case of a large pair of sunnies , a slick of lippie , a truck - load of attitude - and off you go			1
mind that step , now			0
the all - in - one hair wash is back 12 - in - one : grow @entity191 is a cleanser and conditioner with a host of other effects ' take two bottles into the shower ? not me ... i just want to wash and go ! ' remember that ? you must be as old as me then			2
@entity202 's all - in - one shampoo and conditioner was the archetypal product for the yuppie decade			1
after all , if @entity206 thought lunch was for wimps , imagine what he would have made of hair conditioner ? thirty years on , and the one - bottle hair trend is back			2
only this time it 's known as co-washing			2
sounds like one of those @entity216 - style euphemisms ; in fact it 's just short for conditioning wash			1
essentially , it 's washing your hair in a souped - up conditioner in order to remove dirt and grease without stripping the hair of its natural oils			1
@entity231 and @entity232 women will probably already be familiar with it , as will those with very curly hair			0
but in this age of straighteners and curlers and rainbow colours , co-washing has become more mainstream , as it offers the ideal solution to the difficulties of caring for over-treated hair			0
nevertheless , it 's best suited to thick or curly hair , although if your mop is colour treated , or if it 's had a lot of sun exposure this year , you may also want to give it a go			2
if you like that audible feeling of squeaky cleanliness , though , avoid			0
and if you suffer from dandruff or psoriasis , check with your dermatologist beforehand			0
crush ... words like ' miracle ' and ' flawless ' are often bandied around in the beauty industry , but in the case of @entity262 , they 're justified			0
fail ... do we really need to see reality star @entity265 's facemask , below ? enough already with the selfies ! if you 're one of those sporty types who washes their hair daily , try to limit your co-washes to three a week , and use a gentle , sulphate - free shampoo in - between			1
and be careful if you have hair - extensions : the added oils may loosen the connections			2
needless to say , the number of co-washing products on the market is growing almost hourly			0
here 's the pick of the current crop ... grow @entity191 : a new 12 - in - one cleanser / conditioner , no less , promising volume as well as shine , softness , smoothness and a host of other miraculous effects			1
@entity293 - @entity292 : sulphate and glycerin free , and enriched with coconut oil for extra de-tangling			2
@entity297 : designed for curly hair , it will also work on very dry tresses			0
leaves hair feeling very soft and light			0
