by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity2 has received an apology letter from @entity5 immigration officials after they mistakenly thought she had been barred from the @entity7 because of her self - confessed drug use			1
the celebrity chef , who last year admitted to previously taking cocaine and cannabis , flew to @entity5 on may 3 for a promotional tour for @entity14 's chocolate			1
before the 54 - year - old arrived at @entity16 she was initially granted a ' special direction ' visa to work in @entity19			2
but officials have now admitted the waiver , which was issued in april , was not needed as there was no evidence she had been banned from entering the @entity7			1
' he explained that @entity30 previously believed @entity2 's immigration status was ' inconclusive ' so they had granted a ' special direction ' visa to speed things along			1
a spokeswoman for @entity30 said the department ‘ was aware of issues reported in the media about [ @entity49 ’s ] inability to travel to the @entity7 ’ when they were assessing her visa application			0
@entity2 has no drug convictions so she is not legally barred from any country			0
@entity2 's lawyer in @entity5 @entity57 told @entity31 : ' the only comment we want to make was everyone was very happy with the outcome and how everything turned out			1
' successful : @entity2 had no problem with customs at @entity16 on may 3 apology : @entity30 area manager @entity29 said : ' we regret any inconvenience caused ' when asked how @entity2 came to be considered an excluded person in the first place , ms @entity57 said : ' i guess there were various media reports and i guess there was speculation about what may or may not have occurred			1
' they 've cleared up the position with their statement to us so that should n't be in doubt anymore			0

they can then decide to prevent entry to the country even if the person involved was never charged			0
however , @entity2 was never arrested , and @entity97 police said in january that she would not face any police action over her admission of drug - taking , in part out of fears that charging her would deter other court witnesses from telling the truth			2
