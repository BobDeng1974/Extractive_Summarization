@entity0 wants new laws to protect journalists ' sources @entity0 has demanded new laws to ban police from accessing journalists ' phone records to identify their sources without a judge 's warrant			1
the deputy prime minister has written to the home secretary @entity11 urging her to introduce the new protections before the end of the month			1
it comes after an official government report found there were not ' adequate safeguards to protect journalistic sources '			1
sir @entity19 , the interception of communications commissioner , said the @entity22 – @entity22 – left journalists unprotected			2
his report said : ' it is recommended that judicial authorisation is obtained in cases where communications data is sought to determine the source of journalistic information			2
' a review of the use of the @entity22 surveillance powers was launched in october after alarm was expressed about incidents such as @entity35 accessing the phone records of @entity38 reporter @entity37 to find who had leaked information on the @entity41 row			0
the commissioner found that over a three - year period 19 police forces had sought communications data in relation to 34 investigations into illicit dealings between public officials and journalists			1
some 608 applications for such data were authorised , by a ranking officer			0
but the report stressed that was just 0.1 % of the total applications authorised by police under the legislation			0
it also concluded that police had not used @entity22 to circumvent other legislation and forces were not ' randomly trawling communications data relating to journalists in order to identify their sources '			1
' generally speaking , the police forces did not give the question of necessity , proportionality and collateral intrusion sufficient consideration , ' the report said			0
' they focused on privacy considerations ( @entity75 ) and did not give due consideration to freedom of speech ( @entity77 )			0
' the current @entity78 ( and the recently revised @entity79 said to provide protection for sensitive professions ) do not provide adequate safeguards to protect journalistic sources or prevent unnecessary or disproportionate intrusions			1
' the prime minister 's official spokesman said @entity87 accepted the commissioner 's recommendation			1
' he very much welcomes the report			0
he believes that the report makes the case well for the judicial oversight it recommends in cases of data comms applications that are relevant to journalistic sources and that is why the government is accepting that recommendation , ' the spokesman said			2
the home secretary @entity11 is under pressure to introduce new laws forcing the police to get a warrant before accessing journalists ' phone records in a letter to home secretary @entity11 , @entity0 deputy prime minister @entity0 called for legislation to be brought forward later this month			1
' as you know , i have consistently raised my concerns about the protection of journalists ' sources in relation to acquisition of communications data under the @entity22 , ' mr @entity0 wrote			2
' the report published today by the @entity120 recommends that ' judicial authorisation must be obtained in cases where communications data is sought to determine the source of journalistic information '			0
' we have an opportunity to act on this recommendation at report stage of the @entity130 in the @entity131 on february 23			0
i hope that you will look urgently at drafting @entity100 amendments to that effect			0
