by @entity0 published : 11:28 est , 23 july 2012 updated : 03:34 est , 24 july 2012 the global ban on ivory trading should be lifted to stifle the recent surge in elephant poaching in @entity6 , the @entity1 was told today			2
if adopted , the proposals would allow the sale of ivory only from elephants that died naturally , were culled for ecological reasons , killed in a trophy hunt or because they posed a threat			1
the international black market for ivory has risen rapidly since 2004 largely because of a growing @entity16 demand for ivory chopsticks , statues and jewelry			2
ruthless , gun - toting gangs patrol the wilds of @entity6 , butchering elephants for their tusks before selling them on to @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity28 smugglers who make huge profits in their homelands			0
growing market : the recent rise in @entity34 poaching has steadily worsened since 2004 thanks to a growing market in @entity16 it is the first time such a proposal has been made since a global ban on ivory came into effect in 1989			1
the proposal was put forward in a report commissioned by the 175 - nation @entity44 , a treaty overseen by the @entity47 in @entity48			1
' given the present rise in illegal killing of elephants in @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity6 , it is clear that current measures are not containing the present upsurge in the illegal trade in ivory , ' the report concludes			2
' the tendency to ascribe this increase to the sale of stockpiled ivory in 2008 diverts attention away from the far more serious problems relating to the inability of @entity67 countries to invest in protecting their elephants			0
' big business : the rise has been driven by @entity16 demand for ivory chopsticks , statues and jewelry , right @entity67 countries , where the majority of elephants are , want some form of legal trade to help pay for their conservation efforts and sell off already growing ivory stocks			1
@entity55 and @entity6 countries have in the past opposed any legal trade , fearing it will undermine conservation efforts and further bolster the illegal trade			0
environmentalists , too , have come out against the proposal because they argue that the reasons behind it - that legal trade would help reduce ivory prices , and thus demand - remain unproven			2
victims : the rise in rhino poaching will also be on the agenda with several measures to tackle the illegal hunting , mostly in @entity102 also in the spotlight : in @entity16 , rhino horn has about the same street value as that of cocaine in the @entity108			1
it is crushed and consumed by people in @entity16 who believe it can cure diseases including cancer , fever and even hangovers the rise in rhino poaching will also be on the agenda with several measures to tackle the illegal hunting , mostly in @entity102			1
it will address how better to regulate the trophy hunting trade and make greater use of dna technologies to trace horns that are seized to help convict the poachers and traffickers			0
a report by the @entity128 found that @entity28 was ' the major destination ' for rhino horns trafficked from @entity102 , where 448 rhinos were poached last year			0
