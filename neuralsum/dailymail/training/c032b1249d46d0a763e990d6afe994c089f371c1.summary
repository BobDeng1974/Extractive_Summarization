as well as being home to 25,000 displaced @entity6 and dozens of aid workers , the squalid @entity1 refugee camp - where @entity3 @entity2 was captured by militants in march last year - is located just one mile from an @entity9 stronghold full of swaggering @entity11 jihadists who lived in a hilltop villa			1
temporary canvas tents line the so - called @entity16 camp 's tracks , but the residents dared not dream of going back to their home towns - and certainly would n't risk visiting nearby @entity1 village			1
their lives and those of the aid workers such as @entity2 were in stark contrast to the self - described ' goodly ' existence of @entity9 militants are living in @entity1 - who posed for boastful photographs with expensive vehicles , swimming in luxury pools and relaxing in a huge mansion overlooking the camp			1
while the swaggering militants enjoy ' five star jihad ' living like medieval lords in their hilltop fort , the terrified refugees below were forced to suffer regular raids on their rundown camp			2
it appears to have been on one of these missions that @entity2 was kidnapped along with three other men while working for an aid company @entity44 can now reveal to be the @entity45			2
the contrasting squalor of the @entity16 camp is just a short distance away isis dominate the village of @entity1 , with militants regularly taking photographs of themselves at the villa @entity9 militants are based just a short drive from the @entity16 refugee camp in the nearby @entity1 village the militants are believed to use this villa in the village of @entity1 as a centre for their local operations the internet cafe in @entity1 village is dominated by @entity68 flags , highlighting the danger so close to the camp @entity9 militants are known to have started massing in @entity1 late last year - around the time @entity72 condemned the group 's barbarism , and a few months after @entity2 was kidnapped from the camp			1
before this other @entity68 militant groups were active in the area - among them the feared @entity76 , who are believed to have originally kidnapped slain @entity79 journalist @entity78 before militants defecting to @entity9 eventually took him with them			1
as if so - often the case with tech - savvy , @entity84 - raised militants , many of the young @entity9 fighters opted to document every aspect of life in their new stronghold is a series of social media posts			0
in stark contradiction to the hardships of the refugee camp below , a group of militants appear to have lived in a large hilltop mansion in @entity1 - posting images of themselves posing with expensive cars , swimming in luxury pools and keeping fit at an outdoor gym			1
the hub of their operations in @entity1 , however , seems to have been the village 's internet cafe , where the men photographed themselves browsing on the internet while wielding guns in a room decorated with black and white jihadist flags			1
when two of the @entity11 militants , @entity113 , 22 , and @entity115 , 23 , were killed in clashes , a third fighter paid tribute to them @entity118 , saying : ' this brother [ @entity115 ] need no introduction			0
those who knew him knew he was always working for his deen [ religious path ]			0
' revealing the training the group had , the militant added : ' he had the best manners , he came with a brother and left this world with the brother ! they where tight and where both at the top of their classes and within a month where graduated as commandos and started teaching others			0
' danger : @entity11 hostage @entity2 was captured by militants in the @entity1 camp in march last yea @entity145 : canvas and plastic tents line the camp 's squalid tracks but the residents dare not dream of leaving to visit the nearby @entity9 - occupied @entity1 village as @entity2 was kidnapped by @entity68 militants in @entity1 refugee camp early in 2013 , there is nothing to suggest this particular band of @entity9 loyalists active in @entity1 later in the year had anything to do with his disappearance , and exact details of who carried out the kidnapping remain sketchy			1
it is also unclear whether the group are still active in @entity1 , which falls outside official estimates of territory under @entity9 control - although these maps tend to ignore isolated pockets the group operates within , particularly in western @entity6 where villages are regularly taken and lost			2
despite the dangers posed by jihadists of all persuasion on its doorstep in 2013 , the @entity16 camp attracted a number @entity177 eager to raise awareness of the refugees ' desperate situation			0
among them was @entity183 - the @entity79 journalist brutally beheaded by an @entity9 militant earlier this week in a sickening video that made public the fact the group also held @entity2			2
in january 2013 - just two months ' before @entity2 ' capture - @entity183 wrote a harrowing dispatch from @entity1 , in which he detailed the despair of families with so little to eat that they willingly sold blankets protecting them from the harsh @entity6 winter in order to buy bread for their malnourished children			1
the extremist group now presides over a mass of land equivalent to the size of the @entity11 , from @entity201 to central @entity202 , and controls at least four million people			0
@entity1 is close to the border with @entity206 @entity208 snacks : as if so - often the case with tech - savvy , @entity84 - raised militants , many of the young @entity9 fighters opted to document every aspect of life in their new stronghold is a series of social media posts known as the @entity218 , @entity1 was set up in 2011 by @entity220 - based @entity219 after a group of its employees stumbled across dozens of locals sitting among the olive tress that hug @entity6 's barbed - wire border fence with @entity206			1
the refugees had fled their homes as the @entity6 conflict intensified , but their hope of being allowed to seek refuge in @entity206 was in vain and so they were left with nowhere to go and very little to eat			0
over the next two years , the number of people living in the camp grew steadily as @entity219 were joined by groups such as @entity237 in providing food and medical aid			0
the growth of @entity9 in the area isolated the locals still further - and among the images uploaded to social media by the militants were photographs of them practicing shooting in the very olive groves that gave the camp its name			1
vast numbers of @entity11 jihadists have arrived in @entity6 via @entity206 's popular @entity253 airport , where they pose as tourists before slipping off along countryside roads leading to the war - torn country			0
in one unverified image uploaded by an @entity1 - based militant last year , the border between @entity206 and the camp in @entity6 is shown as little more than a seemingly unguarded barbed - wired fence			0
he captioned the image : ' now how easy does that look ? ' swaggering : jihadists based in @entity1 - just one mile from the @entity16 refugee camp - have boasted of living ' the goodly life ' at their huge hilltop villa among the images uploaded to social media by the militants were photographs of them practicing shooting in the very olive groves that gave the camp its name even the trees inside @entity1 are not safe from @entity9			1
last november a 150 - year - old tree ( right ) was cut down by a masked militant wielding a chainsaw ( left ) after militants said locals praised the tree more than @entity287 for many would - be militants the first stop along the way is the village of @entity1 , which is believed to have become an @entity9 stronghold due to the sheer number of @entity84 fighters arriving via @entity206			1
the town 's police station was painted in the distinctive black and white of @entity9 ' flag - a symbolic reminder that for them , law and order is a religious concept , not a man - made one			2
the @entity9 militants and the various faction that came before them also carry out regular raids in the @entity1 camp			1
officially at least it is protected by rebels from the @entity310 , but as the population swelled the defence force has often proved incapable of stopping unwanted elements getting in - including jihadists , forces loyal to @entity6 president @entity315 , and opportunist militia factions sent by local tribal leaders			0
when @entity183 wrote his dispatch for @entity320 during the bitter @entity322 winter last january , the full terrifying force of @entity9 had yet to properly arrive in @entity1			2
within just a few months , even the trees inside the camp were not safe from militants			0
last november a 150 - year - old tree was cut down by a masked militant wielding a chainsaw after it was deemed the residents of @entity1 spent more time venerating it than they did praising @entity287			0
a @entity6 girl , who fled her home with her family in @entity335 , collects water from a makeshift well inside @entity1 a child is seen standing amid the squalor of the refugee camp			0
it is home to about 25,000 people @entity6 children live under difficult conditions and lack of water in @entity1 camp , close to the @entity206 border injured : @entity350 , 10 , who suffered burns in a @entity6 government airstrike and fled his home with his family , stands outside their tent at @entity358 camp			2

militants boasted about luxury *lifestyle* and living in @entity1 village mansion
*shared* images of themselves swimming in villa 's *private* pool and using gym
@entity371 also decorated local internet cafe with black and white jihadist flags
@entity9 militants arrived in area in late 2013 , months after @entity2 ' kidnapping
previous @entity68 groups had operated in the area and raided @entity1 camp
these included feared @entity76 , who originally kidnapped @entity78
