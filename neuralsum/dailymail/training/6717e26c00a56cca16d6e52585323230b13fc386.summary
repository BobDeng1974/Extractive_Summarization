by @entity0 last updated at 9:57 am on 8th november 2011 bitter battle : @entity2 , 55 , outside @entity4 's @entity3 after she won her fight to hang on to a £ 4.4m divorce package a divorcee has won her battle to hold on to a £ 4.4million slice of her ex-husband 's ancestral fortune despite contributing nothing to their shared wealth			1
@entity2 , 55 , was awarded a £ 2million nine - bedroom country house set in 40 acres of parkland , £ 75,000 a year for child maintenance , a £ 1.65million lump sum to meet her ' reasonable needs ' and other assets after splitting with @entity22 in july 2009			1
a high court judge agreed on the division of the couple 's £ 12million estate in august , after describing the couple 's wealth as ' not the product of the endeavours ' of either of them			1
mr @entity22 , 61 , a chartered surveyor , yesterday challenged the decision at the @entity33 , claiming he had ' arguably contributed 100 per cent ' to the fortune – most of which has been in his family for years			1
however , yesterday the court upheld the original judgment			2
the ruling comes amid claims that courts have lost touch with the idea of ' reasonable needs ' for wives in big - money divorce cases			2
lord @entity47 , sitting with @entity48 and sir @entity49 , heard that mrs @entity2 was given @entity50 , the couple 's former home in @entity53 , @entity54 – and £ 75,000 for renovations – following the original @entity57 hearing			1
the house , set over three storeys , was described as having ' large gardens , woodlands , lakes , a tennis court and swimming pool '			2
the couple , who married in 1985 , raised their five children there before moving to the £ 2million @entity69 in @entity70 , @entity71			2
@entity72 , representing mr @entity22 , attacked mrs @entity2 's award as ' exorbitant '			1
he described the house as ' enormous ' and far beyond her ' reasonable needs ' now that most of the former couple 's children , aged between 15 and 30 , have flown the nest			2
' the word “ needs ” has been hollowed out and we have lost connection with it , ' the barrister said			0
' a nine - bedroom property of this stature was clearly over and beyond her needs			0
' however , @entity88 , for mrs @entity2 , argued that her ex-husband should count himself lucky to have only lost about a third of his ancestral wealth			0

it is the @entity53 home which mrs @entity2 can hold on to following the ruling			0
after the hearing mr @entity22 said : ' it 's a funny old system , but there you go ' ' the wife 's award represented less than 50 per cent of the assets , ' he told the court			1
' although @entity116 is described as nine - bedroomed , three of the rooms are very small , or tiny			0
' lord justice @entity47 said : ' you can say the property was so large or valuable that the judge was plainly wrong to give it to her			0
that is easy to understand but difficult to succeed on in an appeal , because it is a matter of discretion			0
i can see no trace of error , or the slightest chance of succeeding on an appeal			0
' after the hearing , mr @entity22 said : ' it 's a funny old system , but there you go			1
' he inherited a vast fortune , including several farms , a substantial shares portfolio and a shooting estate , following the death of his father			0
the source of the @entity142 ' wealth was a large manufacturing business , which was floated in the 1950s and sold in the 1980s			0
the legal costs of @entity22 and mrs @entity2 's divorce have been estimated at almost £ 700,000 .			1

after hearing , @entity22 said : ' it 's a funny old system , but there you go '
