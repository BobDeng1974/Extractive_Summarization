by @entity0 published : 06:49 est , 13 august 2013 updated : 06:49 est , 13 august 2013 it is famed as an iconic weekend break destination – especially at this time of year , when its @entity3 turn it into a colourful mass of laughter and cool culture			0
throw in some of @entity10 ’s best - loved tourist sights – the historic stretch of the @entity12 ; the 12th century @entity13 rising high on its bluff ; the rearing hilltops of @entity17 – and you have a splendid location that pulls in holidaymakers in their thousands			2
pretty damn steep : @entity22 has great scenery , in the form of @entity17 - but a visit may cost you but tourists heading to @entity22 this summer will have to pay for the privilege – as , according to a new survey , the city is the most expensive in @entity10 for a mini-break			1
according to research released by reviews website @entity36 , the @entity33 capital is the priciest of 20 key @entity10 cities when it comes to both the cost of a four - star hotel room and a one - night break ( with accommodation , pre-dinner drinks , meal for two and a taxi home )			1
@entity22 topped the poll for the average price of a four - star hotel booking , at £ 207.51 for a single night ’s stay – proving over £ 20 more costly than its nearest competitor @entity52 ( £ 180.12 ) and over £ 30 higher than third - placed @entity53 ( £ 173 per night )			1
perhaps surprisingly , @entity36 ’s statistics suggest that @entity55 is only the fourth most expensive city in the @entity10 when it comes to the fee for a four - star hotel – with the average price for a one - night stay revealed as £ 159.94 , almost £ 50 less costly than @entity22			1
@entity22 also headed the list when it came to the overall price of a one - night break			1
the combined tally for a night ’s holiday in the city – including hotel , two dry martinis to start the evening , a meal of steak and chips with a bottle of house wine for two , and a cab back to the hotel at the end of the evening – leaves just small change from £ 300 , at £ 298.46			0
daylight robbery : @entity53 ( left ) , with its famous university and studious atmosphere , is also ranked as a costly option for a @entity10 break - but @entity83 , the ' home ' of @entity84 ( right ) , is listed as the best - value city visitors can find slightly better value in second - placed @entity53 , where the same price equation came up with a total sum of £ 275.32 , and in fourth - placed @entity52 , where you are likely to pay £ 261.41 – exactly £ 3 less than third - placed @entity55 , at £ 264.41			1
however , holidaymakers visiting @entity10 – or spreading their wings within it – can find better deals if they look to some of the country ’s less heralded weekend - away options			2
@entity83 – home to the legend of @entity84 and the lovely open space of @entity99 – is apparently the @entity10 ’s cheapest major city for a mini-break			2
a one - night stay in a four - star hotel will set you back an average £ 73.21 – nearly enough for three nights in @entity22 – while the full cost of the stay , with food and drink , tallies to ‘ just ’ £ 164.73			1
other ‘ bargain ’ possibilities include @entity111 ( £ 81.87 for a four - star hotel room , £ 167.51 for a complete one - night package ) , @entity114 ( £ 83.86 for the hotel , £ 175.81 overall ) , @entity116 ( £ 83.82 per room , £ 179.59 in all ) and @entity118 ( £ 84.85 and £ 180.32 respectively )			0
the figures also suggest that @entity120 has grown in popularity as a getaway possibility in the last 12 months – and has raised its prices to match			0
the @entity125 metropolis – with its dramatic industrial heritage , numerous canals , rising restaurant scene and lively nightlife – was ranked as the best - value option in the survey conducted in 2012 , when a complete - package one - night break was available for £ 139.54			2
@entity134 plus : @entity120 , with its restored industrial heritage , is another cheap option - though rising in price twelve months on , that figure has leapt to £ 183.82 – although that still leaves @entity120 as the sixth cheapest city for a @entity10 mini-break in 2013 , according to the poll			1
“ with the great summer we ’ve been enjoying , staycations are sure to be a popular choice for @entity10 travellers over the august bank holiday , ” says @entity36 ’s @entity144			0
“ but where you go will have a big impact on how much you are likely to spend			0
“ generally , the further north you go , the less you need to fork out for hotels and dinner			0
“ but there are some notable exceptions to that rule			0
so make sure you plan ahead			0
