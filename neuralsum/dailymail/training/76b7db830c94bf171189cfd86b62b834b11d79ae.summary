relentless rises : air tax has risen astronomically over the 20 years since its inception infographic shows the rises in everyday taxes between 1994 and 2014 , illustrating the extreme air tax rise @entity20 , chief executive of @entity22 ' parent company @entity21 , said : ' twenty years on , @entity3 has snowballed out of control and become a tax that works against people wanting to visit relatives and friends , go on holiday or grow their business to create jobs			1
' @entity3 is way out of line with both other indirect taxes in the @entity33 and flight taxes in other countries			1
globalisation has accelerated enormously in the last 20 years			0
this tax helps no - one in today 's economic environment			0
we must call time on @entity3			1
' back in 1994 short - haul passengers paid £ 5 per person , and long - haul passengers £ 10			2
now a 160 per cent increase has taken it up to £ 13 for short haul flights , while a long haul flight will come in at between £ 67 - £ 93 in tax			0
that seven-fold increase in @entity3 has taken place while inflation has not even doubled over the same period			2

a family of four flying to a destination outside @entity11 will soon pay £ 284 in tax , compared with just £ 40 in 1994 @entity64 believe the abolition of @entity3 would create more flights and some 60,000 new jobs a spokesperson for @entity64 told @entity71 : ' @entity3 is damaging for traffic , tourism and jobs , makes countries uncompetitive and hinders countries from reaching their full tourism potential			1
' many @entity11 countries , including @entity78 , @entity79 and the @entity80 , have scrapped @entity3 after traffic declined at their airports and have since returned to growth			2
indeed , in the six months since the @entity84 scrapped @entity3 on april 1 , over 1.1m additional customers have travelled through the five main @entity79 airports , with @entity64 contributing 60 per cent of this growth			2
' the @entity33 @entity84 should follow suit , as the abolition of @entity3 would yield 0.46 per cent of the @entity33 gdp in the first year and at least £ 16bn within three years , creating new flights and 60,000 new jobs			1
' low - cost carriers such as @entity92 believe the abolition of @entity3 would boost the @entity33 economy these sentiments are echoed by @entity96 , who added : ' @entity96 has long campaigned for the abolition of @entity3 because independent research shows that it would boost the @entity33 economy and pay for itself by increasing revenues from other sources			1
' the @entity33 has the highest air passenger taxes in the world			0
this has a negative impact on tourism , investment and business activity			0
' annual @entity109 revenue from @entity3 is now nearly ten times as much as in the tax 's first full year			0
in total , air passengers in the @entity33 have paid more than £ 26 billion in @entity3 since 1994			1
even on short - haul flights , @entity3 has become a big proportion of the ticket price			0
the £ 26 @entity3 payable per person on a return flight within the @entity33 is frequently at least a quarter of the total fare			1
according to @entity122 analysts @entity119 , abolition of @entity3 would boost @entity33 's economic growth by 0.5 per cent within a year and lead to the creation of 60,000 new jobs without reducing the @entity109 's net revenues			1
back in august , a @entity109 spokesman said : ' the government has taken steps to reform @entity3 and at @entity130 announced changes which , from april 1 , 2015 , will abolish the two highest tax bands			0
' the reforms will cut tax for millions of passengers travelling to emerging markets such as @entity137 , @entity138 and @entity139 , and to places with historic ties to the @entity33 such as south @entity142 and the @entity143			0
' in 2015 - 16 , over 99 per cent of passengers will see a freeze or cut in @entity3			0
