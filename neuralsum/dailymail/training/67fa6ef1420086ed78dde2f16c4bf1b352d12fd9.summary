the education secretary , tipped as an heir to @entity11 , padded around the £ 2,500 - a - week spa in his bathrobe and fluffy slippers – and was the only man there			1
mr @entity2 , who ballooned to 15st after the @entity6 won power with the @entity17 , has lost 2st since visiting the @entity19 health resort , which is popular with celebrities including @entity21 and the @entity22			1
fit for power : a trimmer mr @entity2 , right , after his spa visit , and how he looked in may 2012 , left the centre on the shores of @entity28 is not for the fainthearted			1
mr @entity2 was stripped of his two mobile phones and laptop , banned from drinking caffeine or alcohol , and restricted to consuming just 600 calories a day			1
treatments at the @entity19 clinic include colonic irrigation and blood - letting			1
one female guest , who visited the spa at the same time as mr @entity2 this summer , told @entity41 the cabinet minister was ‘ pink - faced , chilled and smiley ’			1
‘ he took advantage of many health and beauty treatments , and chatted to the women over fruit teas , ’ she said			2
‘ supper was soup and stale bread – stale because it makes you chew it a lot – while the first thing we had to do every morning was drink @entity59 salts and magnesium citrate to clear out the system			0
strict : @entity62 , @entity4 , where guests eat soup and stale bread in their quest to fight the flab ‘ breakfast was sheep ’s yogurt and a piece of avocado			0
the hunger gave us terrible headaches			0
one woman said to mr @entity2 , “ it ’s grim , is n’t it ? ” and he replied , “ it ’s worth it			2
politics takes it out of you , and conference season ’s coming up – this is a good way to recharge the batteries			0
” ’ the fellow guest admitted that she felt ‘ utterly dreadful ’ for a couple of days , but then ‘ woke up and felt wonderful ’			0
friends noted how much trimmer mr @entity2 looked on @entity90 ’s @entity89 on thursday			2
@entity91 in ! mr @entity2 was restricted to consuming just 600 calories a day at the clinic however , sticking to his diet will be tricky at conference as he attends a gut - busting number of dinners and drinks receptions			1
the disclosure that he has been to a fat farm will fuel rumours that he is shaping up to make a leadership challenge when mr @entity11 eventually steps down as prime minister			0
mr @entity2 has dismissed the speculation , saying he is ‘ too ugly ’			2
he claimed ugly people have to spend more on their appearance than beautiful people to avoid descending ‘ into the realms of the godawful ’			0

in her @entity113 column she said that he had just returned from @entity4 ‘ with a pair of swimming trunks in the style of lederhosen ’			0
