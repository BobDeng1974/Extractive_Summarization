by @entity0 @entity1 : 19:38 est , 29 december 2013 @entity2 : 19:38 est , 29 december 2013 not so long ago the idea of tourist day trips to the edge of space and back was dismissed as hot air			1
but tickets have just gone on sale for the ultimate balloon flight to see the wonders of our planet from 19 miles up			1
an @entity16 firm yesterday announced plans to take eight passengers to within touching distance of space inside a gondola attached to a helium balloon in 2016			1
views : passengers will be able to see the curvature of the @entity26 even though the balloon ’s space - age basket will be pressurised those on board might want to hold their breath when paying for their prized seat			1
the flight , lasting less than eight and a half hours , will cost £ 45,500			0
they will however be able to see @entity26 ’s curvature and experience a few moments of weightlessness – as well as sup a cocktail at the bar and beam back ‘ selfies ’ with the stars to their envious social media friends thanks to the on - board @entity42			0
‘ we want to give people the experience of seeing the @entity26 from space for hours and contemplating the curvature of the planet and all that comes with that , ’ said @entity44 , chief executive of the @entity46 - based company @entity45			2
the 40 million cubic - foot ( 1.1 million cubic - meter ) balloon will take off from sir @entity57 ’s spaceport in the @entity59 desert			2
ground control : the flights will launch from sir @entity57 's spaceport in the @entity63 , which can be seen beneath the @entity65 craft , pictured the craft will take two hours to reach its maximum cruising height of about 100,000ft and where the sky turns dark			0
it will then cruise across the stratosphere to allow the starry - eyed passengers to gape in wonder at the blue planet below , our galaxy and the wider universe			2
the gondola will then disconnect from the balloon and return to earth under a para-wing			1
space proper starts at 62 miles but the passengers will experience a few seconds of weightlessness during the rapid 20 - minute controlled descent , said @entity44			1
the craft will stop a few miles short of the point reached last year by the @entity87 @entity86 , 44 , who set the world ’s skydiving record by jumping from a helium balloon 24 miles above @entity26			1
‘ think of this as a super-first - class high - end luxury experience , ’ said @entity44 ’s husband , @entity92 , the company ’s chief technology officer , who used to design life support systems for @entity95			0
the couple spent two years as ‘ bionauts ’ sealed inside a simulated space station in the @entity46 desert in the 1990s , an experiment that shaped scientific thinking about man living on @entity105			0
there company is only one of several racing to offer regular tourist space trips , among them @entity111 , a suborbital six - passenger , two - pilot vehicle owned by @entity65 , an offshoot of @entity57 ’s @entity115			0
‘ ten years ago this was all science fiction , ’ said @entity116 , who designed @entity117 , the first private craft to fly into space in 2004 and the prototype for @entity122 ’s new fleet currently under construction			0
‘ now it ’s an engineer ’s everyday fact , ’ he said .			0
