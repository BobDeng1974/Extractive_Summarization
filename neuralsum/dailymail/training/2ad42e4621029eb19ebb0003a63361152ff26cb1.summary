@entity0 is set to pay out £ 43million in compensation after a loan statement blunder left 175,000 customers out of pocket			1
the supermarket giant 's banking arm has offered an apology to customers after a ' technical breach ' meant they failed to send out personal loan and credit card statements			1
it is the latest in a string of errors to hit @entity16 's largest retailing group , currently under criminal investigating for ' cooking their books ' - illegally overstating profits			1
