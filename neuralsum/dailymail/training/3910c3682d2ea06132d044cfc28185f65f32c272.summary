@entity1 's perfect start to the season continued thanks to a 1 - 0 victory secured by @entity6 's 12th - minute tap - in , but @entity7 will be wondering how they are still pointless after two games of the new season			1
they dominated this @entity12 derby for long periods , especially after Â£ 11m summer signing @entity14 came on as a substitute at half - time			2
but they could not find a way past a stubborn @entity1 defence , in which captain @entity21 and goalkeeper @entity22 were outstanding			0
@entity7 manager @entity24 had initially put @entity14 on the bench after claiming that the former @entity27 striker was not fully fit			1
@entity28 returned , one of four changes following the 2 - 1 opening - day defeat away to @entity32			0
tussle : @entity7 's @entity34 and @entity1 's @entity35 battle for the ball @entity1 were unchanged from their victory over @entity27 and settled better early on but it was @entity7 who got in the first shot of the match , @entity43 firing wide after capitalising on the visitors ' failure to clear			1
. @entity43 also had a shot blocked by @entity1 captain @entity21 after good work by @entity49 but it was the @entity50 who took the lead in the 12th minute			1
there seemed little danger as @entity55 crossed from the left , but @entity7 captain @entity58 's attempt to head clear only flicked the ball away from his stranded goalkeeper , @entity60 , and into the path of @entity6 , who scored with ease			1
poor start : @entity7 have lost both of their opening championship games , although could have won either @entity67 defender @entity66 headed wide from @entity69 ' corner as @entity7 looked for a reply			1
the energetic young home side often had @entity1 at full stretch as they played short passes at speed but defenders produced a series of blocks to deny the hosts			2
and left back @entity79 , forward in support of a quick break , almost scored a second goal for @entity1 with a dipping volley after 36 minutes that @entity60 did well to palm over the crossbar			0
two minutes later @entity22 did just as well to flick away a header by @entity7 's @entity87 that was looping in			0
and he was relieved when @entity58 's shot from 25 yards sailed over his head but also over the bar			0
tackle : @entity58 puts in a crunching tackle on @entity1 's @entity94 @entity24 sent on @entity14 after the interval and he almost created the equaliser in the 47th minute , his pass giving @entity28 the chance to send @entity22 sprawling to save a low shot			1
but @entity60 had to rescue his team again in the 57th minute , blocking @entity79 's shot with his right foot after @entity35 had created the opening			0
just before the hour , @entity58 slipped a pass to @entity14 that seemed to have provided his first goal for @entity7			2
but @entity22 was equal to the shot although @entity7 , galvanised by @entity14 , were getting closer			2
@entity28 's shot on the turn beat @entity22 but @entity110 cleared the ball from the goalline			0
and then @entity22 blocked again from @entity14 after he had bustled past @entity113 .			0

@entity7 and @entity1 met at @entity115 in the championship
@entity119 's side have *enjoyed* a perfect start to the season
@entity6 's 12th minute goal won the game
@entity24 's side have lost both their opening games
@entity14 made a second - half *appearance*
