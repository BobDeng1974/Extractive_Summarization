@entity0 has spoken out about the fuss surrounding the photoshopping of her much - anticipated @entity4 cover and photo - shoot , saying she does n't understand the controversy			1
the extent of the photoshopping was revealed by @entity9 , the women 's blog owned by @entity12 , which offered a $ 10,000 bounty for the unretouched pictures			1
the writer and star of @entity18 ’s @entity17 told @entity19 that the controversy ' confuses me a little			0
' cover girl : @entity0 says she is pleased with the results of her photo - shoot with @entity4 ' i understand that for people there is a contradiction between what i do and being on the cover of @entity4 ; but frankly i really do n’t know what the photoshopping situation is , i ca n’t look at myself really objectively in that way , ' @entity0 , 27 , told @entity19			1
' i know that i felt really like @entity4 supported me and wanted to put a depiction of me on the cover			2
i never felt bullied into anything ; i felt really happy because they dressed me and styled me in a way that really reflects who i am			0
and i felt that was very lucky and that all the editors understood my persona , my creativity and who i am			0
' i have n’t been keeping track of all the reactions , but i know some people have been very angry about the cover and that confuses me a little			0
i do n’t understand why , @entity52 or no , having a woman who is different than the typical @entity4 cover girl , could be a bad thing , ' she said			1
editor of @entity54 said that it is the very fact that @entity4 had chosen to manipulate someone like @entity0 's image that the magazine should be taken to task			1
' this is what @entity4 does - and yes , we already know in general what all of these magazines do - but now , on its cover , @entity4 has a woman who rightfully declares that her appearance , with all of its perceived imperfections , should n't be hidden and does n't need any fixing , ' she wrote			1
bounty : @entity9 paid $ 10,000 for the unretouched versions of @entity0 's @entity4 photos in a move some are labeling anti-feminist and mean the @entity75 images , acquired by @entity9 today , show how the @entity17 creator 's jawline has been narrowed , her waistline slimmed and even smile lines removed			1
an image of the 27 - year - old star seated on the edge of a bathtub in a @entity85 dress demonstrates these changes to greatest effect			0
an annotated gif points out that @entity0 's hips have been pulled in , her jawline slimmed , defined and raised			1
the bags under her eyes have been removed and the smile line on the right - hand - side of her face has been erased entirely			0
the whole image is noticeably brighter , and @entity0 's skin has been smoothed			1
' fantasy ' : despite @entity0 being an positive body image role model , she says she does n't have a problem with her retouched @entity4 images ' a fashion magazine is like a beautiful fantasy			1
@entity4 is n’t the place that we go to look at realistic women , @entity4 is the place that we go to look at beautiful clothes and fancy places and escapism and so i feel like if the story reflects me and i happen to be wearing a beautiful @entity116 dress and surrounded by beautiful men and dogs , what ’s the problem ? if they want to see what i really look like go watch the show that i make every single week , ' @entity0 told @entity123			2
@entity54 stands by @entity125 ’s choice to publish the unretouched pictures of @entity0			2
' accusations that we ’re shaming @entity0 are fueled by the assumption that there ’s even something to shame her about , ' she wrote in an email to @entity133			0
response : @entity0 has made her feelings on the matter very clear girl , uncovered : @entity0 says if anyone wants to see what she looks like when not in a @entity4 fashion spread they need only watch her show in which she regularly goes semi-naked , ' girls ' ' the underlying message of these critiques is that there ’s something here to " fix " and @entity4 should take care of the problem			1
there ’s never any outcry when unretouched images of a supermodel surface online			2
' others disagree , labelling @entity9 ' mean girls ' who are using feminism as an excuse to shame @entity0			2
' this is total mean - girl s * * * masquerading as feminism , ' tweeted screenwriter @entity162			0
' tv critic for the @entity166 @entity165 wrote , ' if @entity0 wanted to release her own retouched photos , that might be interesting			0
asking for a bounty on them ? @entity171			0
' @entity0 weighed in with a tweet last night - a reply to @entity165			2
' 10k ? ' she wrote			0
' give it to charity then just order @entity18			0
