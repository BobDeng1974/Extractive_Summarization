the new championship season is upon us with 24 teams looking to emulate @entity3 , @entity4 and @entity5 in winning promotion to the @entity7			2
coming down from the top flight are @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 while @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 will join them in the second tier after earning promotion form @entity17			1
it has been a summer of upheaveal off the pitch for many sides in the @entity23 , with five new managers being appointed and two takeovers going through - assuming that is that @entity28 businessman @entity27 moves in at @entity29 in the coming days as expected			0
trouble ahead ? the inexperienced @entity30 has taken over at @entity31 ahead of the new season turbulent : @entity31 owner @entity34 has already sacked @entity35 while in charge at @entity31 there is a new owner already in place in @entity40 @entity34 and he has in turn appointed a new manager at @entity43 in the previously unknown @entity30			1
@entity44 and @entity45 - themselves both recently taken over by @entity47 and @entity48 owners - have brought in new managers in the shape of @entity51 and @entity52 respectively			0
@entity53 too have a new man at the helm in the form of @entity58 captain @entity57 while @entity61 , in the headlines all summer for all the wrong reasons , have appointed @entity51 ’ predecessor at @entity44 , @entity63			1
how long @entity64 lasts at @entity61 in anyone ’s guess with the club ’s fans in civil war with their owners who have only provided the @entity47 with 17 players to work with			1
with all that out of the way we ’re up to the present day and full fixture list this weekend			0
here ’s a look at the promotion contenders and those who will be fighting the drop ... bounce back ? @entity80 will be hoping for immediate promotion to the @entity7 with @entity10 building from the back : @entity83 is one of several exciting youngsters at @entity12 the favourites @entity10 look in the best shape of the relegated clubs despite a summer of upheaval , while @entity11 should also be in the mix for automatic promotion			1
@entity80 ’s methods have not been popular with all at @entity92 but he has managed to assemble a strong , new squad in a short period of time , spearheaded by £ 11million marquee signing @entity96 from @entity31			2
the @entity98 also have an exciting batch of youngsters who have come through their academy and if @entity80 gets the blend right then the title is @entity10 ’s for the taking			0
@entity11 opted to appoint @entity105 as their full - time manager in may despite him not being able to save them from the drop as caretaker , but they should benefit from the continuity of having a club man in charge			1
the £ 3m capture of 22 - goal @entity114 from @entity116 and the addition of @entity118 forward @entity119 look smart pieces of business but a lot depends on who leaves with nearly four weeks of the transfer window still left - and departures are expected			1
@entity127 ’s exciting young @entity12 squad make them real contenders for back - to - back promotions			0
@entity127 has real strength in depth to call upon in every position and will still do so even if he manages to move on several players still at @entity134 on big contracts from the time of their back - to - back relegations			0
@entity138 will be looking to go one better after @entity140 heartache in the play - off final in may but have lost @entity142 , @entity143 and @entity144 from their squad last season either to injury - in @entity142 ’s case after he made his loan move from @entity149 permanent - or due to the expiration of loans			1
@entity153 ’s squad is a young one too and they can only improve			0
@entity155 and @entity9 ’s squads both lack balance but are full of talent nonetheless			2
if either @entity159 or @entity160 can find the right formula then they could both challenge all of the above for the top two places			0
up for the fight : central midfielder @entity165 will be integral to @entity138 's promotion push dark horses @entity168 have been static in the transfer market as they await investment but still have the benefit of having one of the most prolific academies in the country fuelling their first - team			2
if they can keep hold of the likes of @entity181 , @entity182 and @entity183 then there ’s no reason why they ca n’t finish in the top six , which they so nearly did last season			0
@entity116 flirted with the play - offs towards the end of last season after a brilliant run of form in the spring and if @entity193 - a big - money arrival from @entity195 - can replace the goals of @entity114 they could sneak in to the top six			1
falling out : @entity52 was unhappy with @entity45 chairman @entity198 for selling players despite his high profile the appointment of @entity52 as manager is a massive gamble by @entity45 given that he has not managed at club level for seven years			0
he has a very strong squad to work with though , especially after the £ 5m signing of @entity207 from @entity208 , and if he can get them performing to their potential there is no reason why they ca n’t finish in the top six			0
elsewhere , @entity214 and @entity215 have steadily improved under @entity216 and @entity217 respectively over the last two seasons and will be in the play - off race , while if £ 2.8m @entity221 striker @entity220 can adapt quickly to @entity23 football then @entity223 too will be in the mix. relegation battle as mentioned before , @entity61 are in dire straits and unless there is rapid and significant investment they are doomed			1
even if @entity64 gets up to a full quota of players it will not be easy getting them all pulling in the same direction given the amount of dissent and uncertainty around @entity237			0
promoted duo @entity13 and @entity14 look in good shape and will be confident of finishing above the likes of @entity241 , @entity44 , @entity242 and @entity243 , who all look set for another relegation scrap			1
@entity31 , meanwhile , for the attention around their new owner , have gone backwards in terms of the quality of their playing squad			2
it will be fascinating to see how @entity253 - who has only ever managed in non-league - gets on at a club the size of @entity31 ’ stature			1
the experiment could go horribly wrong			0
tricky business : @entity63 has had a difficult first couple of months in charge of crisis club @entity61			2

@entity11 and @entity9 also looking for *swift* returns to the top flight
@entity61 , @entity31 and @entity241 face relegation battle
@entity116 have an outside chance of a play - off place
*wolves* , @entity13 and @entity14 won promotion from @entity17
