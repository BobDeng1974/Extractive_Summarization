@entity1 @entity0 took a symbolic vote today to impede president @entity3 from using executive actions to ' exempt ' categories of illegal immigrants from deportation			1
the @entity1 voted 219 - 197 to approve the legislation authored by @entity10 rep. @entity9			1
at a press conference before the vote , house speaker @entity11 said the lower chamber would pass the bill to make it clear to @entity3 it was ' rejecting his unilateral actions			1
' while it 's success was assured in the @entity0 - run chamber , it has no chance of seeing daylight in the @entity24 - controlled @entity23			1
@entity1 @entity0 leadership offered the vote as a consolation prize to their right - wing counterparts in @entity30 who want to use a critical spending bill as a cudgel against the @entity34 president			1
' unfortunately for anyone who wants to see @entity30 fix our broken immigration system , the @entity0 approach is being dictated by the most extreme voices in their party , ' @entity45 said in a statement			2
' @entity0 ’ knee - jerk resistance to working with @entity57 to fix this problem left the president with no option but to take action to protect families from being separated			1
' @entity45 encouraged @entity0 to ' put aside their partisan political games ' and instead ' focus their efforts on passing a permanent , common - sense solution to fix our broken immigration			1
' with just four work days left until @entity30 lets out until early january , and a dec. 11 deadline to extend government funding or shut its doors , comprehensive immigration reform is nowhere near the top of @entity0 ' year - end to - do list			1
fearing a government shutdown just as the current legislative session comes to a close ahead of the holidays , establishment @entity0 are asking conservatives to wait until after the party takes control of the @entity23 next year to brawl with the president			1
instead , they plan to proceed with a continuing resolution to fund the entire government except the @entity85 through the end of the current fiscal year			1
the immigration management agency would only be funded through the first quarter of 2015			0
at that time , @entity0 would have the opportunity to push through an appropriations bill with more teeth			2
on @entity94 the legislation is creatively being referred to as the @entity95 - a combination of @entity97 , the shortened version of continuing resolution , and omnibus , a term to describe an overarching spending bill			1
@entity11 said today that the the spending bill would allow the @entity0 to keep the government open while ' keeping our leverage ' so that when they get ' reinforcements ' in the @entity23 in january they can take on @entity3			1
' this course of action was based on numerous conversations with our members , and i frankly think it gives us the best chance for success , ' @entity11 told reporters			2
' we think this is the most practical way to fight the president 's action , ' he said minutes later , noting again that leadership had extensive talks with members of it 's caucus before going down this path			2
' we listened to some members who were frankly griping the most , ' he said			0
' this was their idea of how to proceed			0
' but conservatives in @entity30 have vocally argued that by march of next year , when funding for @entity85 would run out under the current plan , the president will have already begun to issue work permits and green cards to as many as 5 million immigrants			1
therefore , prohibitive legislation must be passed as soon as possible , they say , preferably just after the new @entity30 convenes in january			2
' the president is already printing work permits as we speak			0
why do we want to give him another 2 - 3 months ? we could vote on this the day we get back , ' @entity144 rep. @entity143 told @entity146 news earlier this week			2
@entity148 sen. @entity147 , the ranking member on the @entity149 , exploded on @entity1 leadership on tuesday evening in a statement , arguing that they were reneging on @entity155 chairman @entity154 ' promise that the party would do ' everything we can ' to stop @entity3 's directives from taking effect			1
' unfortunately , the plan now being circulated in the @entity1 fails to meet that test , ' @entity147 said			2
' the executive amnesty language is substantially weaker than the language the @entity1 adopted this summer , and does not reject the central tenets of the president ’s plan : work permits , @entity169 , and @entity170 to 5 million illegal immigrants — reducing wages , jobs , and benefits for @entity175 , ' he added			1
sessions claimed that @entity3 is demanding that ' @entity30 fund his imperial decree and declare its own irrelevance			0
' ' that is why @entity30 must respond to the president ’s unlawful action by funding the government but not funding illegal amnesty , ' he said			2
' such a plan would put the focus where it belongs : on @entity57			0
they are the ones who should be made to choose sides — save @entity3 ’s amnesty or save @entity175 ’ jobs and borders			0
' in a statement sent out the same night @entity144 sen. @entity193 blasted his colleagues in the @entity1 for caving to @entity45 before they even took a vote on conservatives ' preferred legislation			1
' make no mistake , sending a bill to the @entity23 without first making an attempt to include defund language is telling the @entity175 people that you support @entity3 ’s executive amnesty , ' he said			1
' that would be a slap in the face to the voters who sent a message last month by electing @entity0 majorities in @entity30			0
' retiring congresswoman @entity213 of @entity214 made a similar point on wednesday during a press conference with @entity218 rep. @entity217 and @entity220 sen. @entity219			0
' will we be a people who decide that we are going to go with the freight train of what @entity224 , wants or will we listen and harken to the voice of the @entity175 people that was stated unmistakingly on nov. 4 ? ' @entity213 said , according to the @entity228			0
@entity219 told @entity0 who ran on their opposition to unilateral immigration in their recent campaigns ' do what you said you would do			2
' ' doing what you promise does n't mean , as it so often does in @entity224 , sending a really stern letter and having a meaningless show vote			0
why do you think people are so frustrated with @entity224 ? because they recognize there are a whole lot of politicians who say one thing at home and do something different here , ' @entity219 said			0
senator @entity219 speaks to the press about the need ' to defund the president 's executive , @entity252 ' on @entity94 in @entity224 on wednesday with @entity253			0
@entity217 , left , and @entity213 , right			0
@entity219 told @entity0 who ran for reelection on their opposition to unilateral immigration in their recent campaigns ' do what you said you would do ' the probable 2016 presidential candidate warned that ' the same folks who are saying , " gosh , we can not do anything now , " are the same folks who in january are going to say , " gosh , we do n't have 60 votes in the @entity23			1
" ' ' it 's like @entity267 and @entity268 where consistently the same voices pull the football aside and say , " you know what , you can never ever ever do anything to stop a lawless president , " ' he contended			0
even after @entity0 ascend to the majority in the @entity23 , they will still be at least six votes shy of being able to overcome a @entity34 filibuster on prized legislation , unless incoming majority leader @entity281 decides to adopt the so - called ' nuclear option ' of governing that allows bills to advance with a simple majority of votes			1
when @entity45 introduced the nuclear option , @entity288 and other @entity0 legislators railed against it			0
but now that it 's their turn in the driver 's seat , they 're considering making it part of their lawmaking practices , as well			0
in the meantime , conservative hardliners are hoping they can still convince their caucus to vote down the plan currently under consideration by the @entity1 , paving the way for one that funds @entity85 for a shorter time period to come to the floor			1
' i ’m probably leaning no [ on the current @entity1 plan ] , ' @entity308 rep. @entity307 told @entity310 on tuesday night			2
' i think in terms of the @entity97 omnibus , without a limitation language , there are not enough votes			0
i ’m not on the whip team but listening to a number of my colleagues , there is more than enough concern			0
' if the short - term legislation funding @entity322 does pass in the @entity1 , @entity45 has committed to bringing it for a vote in the upper chamber , calling the potential deal a ' big accomplishment ' on tuesday			1
' the @entity175 people certainly will not want to face another year being governed by crisis , ' @entity45 said			0
' no one wants the kind of cliffhanger fights we ’ve had again and again in recent years			0
' @entity11 told reporters today , ' i expect that we 'll have bipartisan support to pass the omnimbus spending bill			1
' @entity9 said this week he was satisfied , for now , that his own legislation to reign in the president 's authority would be given its day in the @entity1			2
' my hat 's off to the leadership , ' @entity9 , an ally of conservative lawmakers , told the @entity228			0
' i commend leadership for saying , ' you know what , this sounds like a commonsense bill			0

legislation impedes president @entity3 from using executive actions to ' exempt ' categories of illegal immigrants from deportation
it passed 219 - 197 in the @entity1 but has no chance of seeing daylight in the @entity24 - controlled @entity23
@entity1 @entity0 leadership offered up the vote as a consolation prize to @entity365 members who want to attach stronger language to a spending bill
*republicans* now plan to pass a bill funding the government - except immigration agencies - through the end of the fiscal year
@entity85 would only receive money through march - giving conservatives another shot at stopping @entity3
