@entity3 's @entity2 @entity1 star @entity0 headed to @entity4 in @entity5 before the start of filming the second series i ’ve always had a love affair with @entity5			1
at the end of filming @entity3 ’s @entity11 last year , i headed to @entity12 , an island off @entity13 , and did a week - long meditation and yoga course			1
i came away convinced i was going to carry on doing a minimum of 30 minutes of meditation every morning in @entity18 – a resolve that was slowly eroded by the stresses of relying on @entity21 and from sunday hangovers			2
so i jumped at the chance of heading out to @entity5 again before the start of filming series two			1
despite an 18 - hour journey on the flawless @entity27 , i arrived in @entity4 still excited about recapturing my zen			2
@entity4 , however , is very different from @entity12			2
first of all it is much greener , and secondly it is definitely an island with party in its bones			2
i was staying at the luxurious @entity35 resort , which comprises a series of minimalist villas complete with surround - sound systems pumping out @entity39 , and each with their own saltwater private infinity pool facing out on to the shimmering @entity42			1
@entity44 co-ordinator @entity43 immediately apologised for the increased security around the resort ( a @entity5 princess and @entity48 from @entity49 were there )			1
i ’m sure you can just sit and chill in the hotel ’s beautiful restaurants or sunbathe on your private terrace , but when @entity43 dropped me off at my villa , she revealed that another famous @entity58 guest – @entity60 @entity59 ( aka @entity59 ) – was performing at a nightclub called seduction that evening			2
i decided zen could wait			2
seduction turned out to be off @entity65 , the heart of @entity4 ’s red - light district			1
having grabbed a tuk - tuk from outside the hotel ( complete with strings of fluorescent lights and speakers blaring out @entity74 ’s @entity73 ) , i arrived at @entity75 itself			2
this is the strip is where zen goes to die			2
@entity0 did yoga at @entity35 ’s @entity81 , on a breathtaking platform called @entity83 , which offers 360 degree views of @entity85 ( pictured ) @entity65 in @entity4 comes to life when the sun goes down			1
the road is shut to cars and becomes 1,312ft of neon lights , loud music and cheap beer there are @entity5 versions of cabaret clubs such as @entity96 and @entity97 , while street hawkers sold tickets to ‘ ping - pong shows ’ , which i later discovered were not as innocent as they sounded			1
@entity43 ushered me up an escalator to @entity104 ’s rooftop party venue			2
@entity59 had just started his set and was whipping up a good - looking @entity5 crowd , all of whom seemed as if they were probably doing an ma at @entity110 in @entity18 , into a frenzy			1
the odd @entity113 tourist was in there too , looking appropriately smug that they had stumbled into this stylish haven and escaped the booming sex trade below			2
the wife of one of the owners of @entity58 turned to me and whispered that everyone inside the club was ‘ vvip ’			2
content in this knowledge , i continued my very @entity126 head - bob to @entity59 ’s hit song @entity127			0
the next morning , breakfast at @entity129 , @entity58 ’s poolside restaurant , was a glorious affair			0
i faced my greatest challenge so far … selecting from the breakfast buffet			0
room with a view ! the luxurious @entity35 resort in @entity4 features an infinity pool overlooking the @entity42 i always get a bit nervous at buffets			1
it has to be a carefully managed procedure , and with only a certain amount of space and a plethora of choice , i did an almost ridiculous amount of hovering before settling on a rather ad hoc selection of banana pancakes followed by a @entity5 fish curry			1
curious but excellent is the only way i can describe this combination			0
it is also testimony to the hotel that all the staff seemed so happy there			0
i caught a couple of them making faces while squirting the pancake mixture on to the griddle and giggling with a joyousness that i ca n’t really imagine at a breakfast buffet in @entity18			0
i whiled away the afternoon reading by my infinity pool , slathering on the factor 50 at every opportunity , as my skin needs to be eased into even the most minimal sun exposure unless i want that a tantalising combination of prickly heat and sunburn			0
the @entity175 is a popular feature in @entity177 , @entity4 i then headed up to @entity35 ’s @entity81 , where you can practise yoga on a breathtaking platform called @entity83 , which offers 360 degree views of @entity85			1
our @entity5 yoga instructor , who coincidentally had a body which looked as if it had been carved out of mahogany , performed the chaturanga at sunset with a sinuousness that reminded me of that scene featuring the yoga instructor from @entity191 , for anyone who knows that film			1
he did n’t quite slap me on the bottom and say ‘ encouragement ’ , but it was a close - run thing			0
then , after a fabulous dinner at @entity58 ’s beautifully appointed @entity5 restaurant @entity198 , where the ‘ squid on hot plate ’ sizzled satisfactorily and the green curry with prawns was to die for , i submitted to the jet - lag and crashed out on pillows on which the maids had placed a shell and an orchid			1
returning to my quest for zen the next morning , i headed north of @entity4 and took a 30 - minute boat ride to a quiet island in @entity177 , which i had been advised was much less touristy than the @entity212 made famous by the film adaptation of @entity215 ’s @entity214			0
i was picked up by the staff of the @entity218 hotel and spa who had lined the bamboo pier , and was driven to the complex by a tuk - tuk , which bore no resemblance whatsoever to the ones in @entity4			0
@entity226 also known as @entity59 , performs a set			0
the @entity60 also stayed at the @entity35 and performed at a nightclub called seduction the hotel is much more of a retreat than @entity58 and puts a lot of emphasis on being an eco-friendly , sustainable resort			1
the landscaped gardens are supposedly ‘ edible ’ , there ’s a space for some of the happiest free - range chickens i ’ve ever seen , and a mushroom hut , where the chef harvests fresh oyster mushrooms			0
but this resort is also beautiful			1
each of the villas contains a double bed with white mosquito nets hanging from interwoven horns , the bathrooms have beautiful copper standalone basins , and from the sunken bath there are exquisite views of the strange islets of @entity177			1
the wooden decking leads to a private pool , but you can also pad down to the private sandy beach which stretches below and go for a swim			0
fruit and drinks by the pool at @entity265 on @entity267 island i ate poached rock lobster in coconut milk , lemongrass , galangal and kaffir lime , and a beef curry on jasmine rice , at @entity218 ’ beautiful @entity276 restaurant before heading to the beach again where the hotel was screening the @entity280 classic breakfast at @entity281 under the stars			0
as i listened to @entity283 describe @entity281 , i thought that this hotel also was a great place to head to when you had the ‘ mean reds ’ – nothing very bad could happen to you here			0
back at @entity35 and there was just enough time to indulge in one more @entity291 - style breakfast curry before take - off			1
i also spotted @entity59 lounging by his pool , so i wandered over to congratulate him on his set a few nights before			0
@entity59 merely shrugged , as if the crazed hero - worship in the club was just a run - of - the - mill tuesday , so i duly toned down my enthusiasm and sauntered off with the look of ‘ yeah , totally , i feel you			0
it ’s a normal tuesday night in @entity4 for me too			1
’ and then it was back to @entity18			0
i may have mislaid my zen in @entity4 but i sure had partied			0
@entity2 @entity1 is out now on dvd			0
@entity27 ( singaporeair.com ) offers return flights from @entity305 and @entity306 to @entity4 via @entity307 from £ 760pp			0
rates at @entity35 start at £ 336 per pool suite per night			1
