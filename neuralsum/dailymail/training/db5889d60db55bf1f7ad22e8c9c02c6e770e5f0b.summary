by @entity0 fewer boys are being born in central @entity2 - and it 's thought pollution may be playing a part			1
a study by the @entity7 found that the ratio of boys to girls being born is falling			1
while evidence suggests that male babies more often die in the womb than females , it is now thought pollution could be one factor behind this			0
ultrasound : the number of baby boys being born in parts of central @entity2 are decreasing across the world , slightly more boys are born than girls			2
but statistics show the proportion of boys to girls being born in @entity2 , or the sex ratio , has been on a downward trend since 1960 - and in the industrial parts of central @entity2 in particular			1
analysing data from 1973 through to 2010 , the team found a ' significant upward skewing ' of the sex ratio in the @entity37 , compared with a downward shift in the @entity39 and the @entity40			2
researchers found ' significantly lower sex ratios for populations where industrial air pollution is highest ' in eastern central @entity2			1
the researchers add their findings are consistent with small studies in heavily industrialised parts of @entity48 and elsewhere in the world			0
more research is needed , they say , but warn that care should be taken when planning large industrial developments , as they may have an effect on hormone levels of the local population			0
the scientists focused on chemicals or pollution that , at certain and sometimes very low doses , can interfere with the endocrine ( or hormone system ) in human beings			0
dr @entity63 , the lead investigator , said : ' the reproductive health of populations is often difficult to measure , particularly before pregnancy and at the early stages			2
' there is strong evidence that during early pregnancy loss , male foetuses are lost more often			0
in utero : evidence suggests that male babies die in the womb more often than females , ' the sex ratio , particularly declines in male births , can therefore be a marker for changes in reproductive health or fertility amongst human populations			1
' our analysis on sex ratio was extensive : over time , regions , neighbourhoods and socio - economic groups across @entity2			2
' he said the results indicate that the effect of pollution on hormones may be to blame for the national decline in the proportion of male births			0
professor @entity98 , also involved in the research , said : ' the study raises important questions about our knowledge of what may impact on human reproductive health and how we then shape public health policy			1
' the study is published in the @entity107 .			0

researchers from the @entity7 looked at birth ratios in @entity2
study found lower sex ratios where industrial pollution was highest
' raises questions about what may impact on human reproductive health '
