@entity1 senator @entity0 says this month 's partial government shutdown and his key role in it were a success : they got people talking			0

@entity0 's crusader 's spirit was the perfect example of what longtime @entity18 in @entity19 and nationally say is at the root of the party 's losing ways and has sparked an intraparty fight over the way forward after losing consecutive presidential elections			1
@entity18 senator @entity0 of @entity1 spoke on friday , october 25 during the @entity18 of @entity19 's @entity33 in @entity22 , @entity19			1
@entity0 said that the partial government shutdown he played a role in was a success because it got people talking about @entity11 it 's a conversation that 's spilling out from backstage to behind the podium between national @entity21 establishment luminaries and state leaders around the country			1
although he ultimately lost , the 42 - year - old freshman senator played a leading role bringing about the 16 - day partial federal shutdown with his demand that president @entity50 gut his 3 - year - old health care law			0
he also successfully urged a core of @entity52 to follow him			0
the final and perhaps most important stop of @entity0 's recent public tour was less an exclamation point on a series of raucous events in @entity1 and more a presentation of opposite ideas for the @entity21 's way forward nationally			2

for nearly five years , republicans have struggled to make a scandal stick to the @entity69 but senator @entity0 believes @entity11 remains a problem immediately before the @entity0 spoke , five - term @entity19 governor @entity72 barely acknowledged the guest and said the way forward for the party nationally was by way of the route cleared by @entity18 governors			1
@entity72 , 66 , at the heart of @entity19 's @entity21 establishment , called @entity0 ' a bright , up - and - coming senator ' before turning his attention to the tangible successes of @entity18 governors , beginning with @entity0 's own governor , @entity84 of @entity1			1
' the results of conservative governors are making a difference , ' said @entity72 , who is preparing to seek election next year			0

@entity0 , with one eye targeting the 2016 presidential race , has not said whether he will take aim again at @entity11 @entity0 has received a lot of attention for trying to hunt down @entity11 but his tactics have failed to show a tangible result			1
@entity0 , pictured hunting pheasants in @entity19 , claims the government shutdown he helped engineer was a success because it got people discussing the @entity11 @entity72 pointed to @entity111 and @entity112 governors moves to trim union rights as reasons for falling unemployment , and @entity1 ' reduction in regulation for rising job growth			1
@entity0 , in his 40 - minute speech , argued the health care law enacted in 2010 was the main impediment to economic growth but was vague after addressing the audience about whether he would continue to try to defund the law in the future			2
@entity0 talked to supporters on friday after speaking at a @entity18 dinner in @entity22 , @entity19			2
with an eye on the 2016 @entity18 presidential nomination , @entity0 told the @entity21 crowd the partial government shutdown he led was a ' success ' ' there will be plenty of time the coming months to talk about specific tactics and strategies , ' he told reporters later			1
' what i think is critical is we keep the focus on @entity11 , we keep the focus on the fact that this bill is n't working			0
' @entity0 said @entity146 senators asking @entity147 secretary @entity148 for an extension of the enrollment period was no surprise			0
but he wished they had called for its repeal or defunding , not ' expand the enrollment period			0
' @entity158 chairman @entity157 pointedly accused @entity160 - fueled refusal to support spending measures during the shutdown foolhardy			0
though @entity72 was n't as direct , he has shown little patience for @entity164 over the past month , especially the drama surrounding @entity0 , and has called for broadening the party to make it more welcoming to voters who have turned away from the @entity21			2
it was @entity0 's third visit to @entity19 , which is expected to hold the leadoff @entity21 nominating caucuses ahead of the 2016 presidential election			1
@entity18 @entity0 , speaking at a rally in front of the @entity175 in @entity176 in early october			2
the senator was championed by crowds that overlooked the fact that he failed in his bid to defund @entity11			0

@entity183 continues to rail against @entity11 even after shutdown vote defeat and public dismay at @entity164
looking toward 2016 presidential nomination @entity0 hunts pheasants in @entity19 but is vague on future strategy to defund @entity11
longtime @entity18 say @entity0 *misfiring* *ideology* is the cause of poor results and @entity21 *infighting* over future direction
