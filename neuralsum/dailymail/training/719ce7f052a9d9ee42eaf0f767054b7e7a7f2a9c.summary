war hero : whilst standing guard one night in may 1918 , @entity1 left four @entity3 dead and injured at least 20 others , who retreated , saving his regiment nearly 100 years after he single - handedly fought off a @entity3 attack and saved a comrade from capture despite suffering serious wounds , sgt. @entity1 is a step closer to getting a posthumous @entity11			1
in an unprecedented move , congress is looking at changing a law that would allow a black @entity16 soldier from @entity17 who saved a comrade while fighting off a @entity3 attack in @entity20 , to be honored			0
a number of congressmen including @entity23 , the secretary of defense , has sent @entity24 a letter saying sgt. @entity1 should receive the nation 's highest military decoration for bravery in combat			1
the railroad porter from @entity31 was serving in the all - black @entity32 when he killed or wounded several enemy soldiers while saving a fellow soldier from capture			2
the president gets the final word on the medal request , which also requires passage of special legislation in @entity24 because @entity1 's actions were more than five years ago			0
the current legislation specifies that heroic actions have to have taken place within five years to be considered			0
his men : @entity1 ( back row , 2nd from right ) was a solider in an all - black outfit , the @entity32 , a @entity50 unit based in @entity51 and known as the @entity53 - fighters the stuff of legend : he almost single - highhandedly fought off his attackers armed only with a rifle and a knife , using the rifle as a club once it had run out of bullets remembered : @entity1 is displayed in the @entity63 neighborhood in @entity31 , @entity17			1
the secretary of defense has recommended awarding a posthumous @entity11 to the black soldier from @entity17 who saved a comrade while fighting off a @entity3 attack in @entity20 during @entity16 ' @entity1 should have received this recognition 95 years ago , and providing an exemption for him now is the right thing to do , ' said @entity72 , a @entity17 @entity73			1
if approved , @entity1 would become the 89th black soldier to receive the @entity11 and just the second for heroism during @entity16 , according to the @entity78 , @entity79 - based @entity77			2
better late thn never : it has been argued that @entity1 should receive the @entity11 - the nation 's highest military decoration for bravery in combat @entity1 , a @entity86 - born rail station porter in @entity31 , enlisted in the @entity32 , a @entity32 unit based in @entity51 that became known as the ' @entity32			1
' with @entity89 armed forces segregated at the time , the 369th was assigned to serve under @entity20 command when @entity1 's outfit arrived on the front lines in early 1918			1
around midnight on may 15 , 1918 , he and another soldier , @entity93 of @entity94 , @entity95 , were standing guard when their position was attacked by about two dozen @entity3			0
both @entity89 were wounded , but despite his injuries the 5ft 4in @entity1 fought off the attack , using his knife and rifle to kill or wound several of the enemy who were trying to drag @entity93 away			2
@entity1 's actions caused the other @entity3 to retreat			2
his actions earned him one of @entity20 's highest military medals , but historians believe rampant @entity109 - era racism at a time when the services were segregated kept @entity1 from receiving @entity89 military honors			1
indeed , accounts of his actions were published in newspapers back home in @entity31 , as well as in @entity116 and @entity117			0
former president @entity119 , in a book he wrote about @entity16 , listed @entity1 among the bravest @entity89 to serve in the conflict			0
' everybody knew who @entity1 was , ' said @entity123 , a retired state lawmaker and @entity31 historian who has been advocating @entity1 's case for 40 years			0
' he was a major source of pride and a realization for the black community and the white community of the value of african - americans to the loyalty of this country			0
' never forget : a statue of @entity1 in @entity136 in @entity31 , @entity17			0
it has been argued that @entity1 be awarded the @entity11 nearly 100 years after he single - handedly fought off a @entity3 attack racist past : @entity1 ’s legacy went unrecognized because of segregation within the armed forces at the time after the war , @entity1 moved back to @entity31 , where he resumed working as a porter			1
plagued by his wartime injuries , he died a destitute alcoholic at age 32 at a veterans hospital @entity149 in 1929			0
he was believed to have been buried in a pauper 's grave , but his final resting place was found in @entity153 in 2002			0
in 2003 , @entity1 was posthumously awarded the @entity154 , the nation 's second - highest military honor			1
previous attempts to get the @entity11 awarded to @entity1 were rejected by @entity159 officials citing insufficient contemporary military documentation of his heroics , but in 2011 , @entity72 's staff found such records			1
local tributes : sgt. @entity1 was part of the @entity166 , or @entity32 - one of the most successful units in the war deserving of more : for his heroics , @entity1 was awarded one of the @entity20 government ’s highest honors , the @entity169			1
the still heavily segregated @entity89 , however , gave @entity1 only a chauffeured car in @entity17 ’s victory parade in 1919 and no awards or military benefits the @entity177 reports from may 1918 described how @entity1 fought off an enemy attack despite being wounded and outnumbered			2
@entity72 included those documents in @entity1 's @entity11 application			2
in 1991 , @entity177 cpl. @entity181 of @entity182 , @entity79 , became the first black soldier honored with the @entity11 from @entity16 after two congressmen resurrected his case for the nation 's highest military decoration for bravery in combat			1
the seven black service members awarded the medal for heroics during @entity193 were n't honored until 1997 , after historians and the defense department determined they had wrongly been denied			0
@entity1 's story is already well - known in @entity31 , where there are two memorials in his honor and a street and a charter school bear his name			1
this year 's awarding of the @entity11 to 24 ethnic or minority @entity89 soldiers from @entity193 and the @entity207 and @entity208 wars has given hope to @entity123 and other advocates that @entity1 will finally receive the same recognition			2
' every time another hero is honored belatedly or rediscovered long after the fact , if you 're in @entity31 , it just gnaws at you , ' the former legislator said			0
' that 's great , but what about @entity1 ? '			0

sgt. @entity1 was part of the @entity166 , or @entity32 - one of the most successful units in the war
@entity1 ’s story became legendary when @entity3 raided his camp , leaving him with more than 20 *gunshot* wounds .
he almost single - highhandedly fought off his attackers armed only with a rifle and a knife , using the rifle as a club once it had run out of bullets
@entity1 left four @entity3 dead and injured at least 20 others , who retreated
@entity1 ’s legacy went unrecognized because of segregation within the armed forces at the time
the nation ’s highest military award , the @entity11 , is reserved for soldiers who exhibit *extreme* valor in wartime efforts
the award can usually only be given up to five years after the event , but it 's hoped the law will be changed in his honor
