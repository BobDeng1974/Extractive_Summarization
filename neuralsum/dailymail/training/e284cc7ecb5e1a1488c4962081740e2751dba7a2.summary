by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 published : 09:51 est , 18 april 2013 updated : 03:34 est , 19 april 2013 for a man who seeks to claim the statesman - like mantle of @entity7 , @entity3 has an odd way of going about it			1
the @entity11 leader triggered comparisons with the much - mocked soapbox of the @entity7 ’s hapless successor @entity14 yesterday as he stood awkwardly on a pallet , microphone in hand , to address voters outside a shopping centre			1
despite cutting a rather ridiculous figure campaigning in the @entity22 by - election – the seat left vacant by his brother @entity24 ’s move to @entity26 – mr @entity3 is clearly determined to acquire some of @entity7 ’s gravitas			1
‘ back in the 1970s it was clear the country needed a new way of doing things – a new settlement – and so too today , ’ he will say			0
‘ the old way of running our economy just does n’t work any more			0
’ in a separate interview he praises @entity7 ’s ‘ utter consistency of ideas ’ , which he suggests he shares			0
he adds that his flirtation with ‘ wonky ’ concepts like predistribution – his complicated plan to tackle inequality – is comparable with the manner in which @entity7 ’s policies and convictions were underpinned by ideology			0
‘ people sometimes say i ’m too interested in ideas , ’ he tells the left - wing website politics for the @entity65			2
‘ but getting the ideas right – the intellectual foundations – is absolutely crucial			0
and they ’re particularly crucial in tough times			0
in tough times you ’ve got to have a robust sense of where you stand			0
’ he suggests @entity75 lacks similar convictions , adding : ‘ there ’s no sense of consistency			0
’ but @entity81 mp @entity80 gave the claim short shrift , saying : ‘ @entity3 ’s record as @entity11 leader is one of no policies , jumping on bandwagons and never making one tough decision			1
@entity7 would have enjoyed handbagging him to political oblivion			0
’ meanwhile an @entity93 poll suggests voters also believe mr @entity3 has a long way to go before he is seen as a potential prime minister			1
just 24 per cent believe he is ready to be prime minister , with 66 per cent saying he is not ready			1
ballot boxes : mr @entity3 's use of a pallet drew immediate comparisons with sir @entity14 's soap box tour during the 1992 general election campaign to the left : the @entity11 leader points during a speech in which he rejected @entity75 's claim that ' we 're all @entity108 now ' brother @entity24 ’s decision to quit @entity43 politics for a big money job running a charity in @entity26 triggered the by - election in the @entity115 constituency			1
@entity3 made a visit there today to drum up support for @entity11 ’s candidate @entity119 during a walkabout and apparently impromptu speech in the high street			1
he was immediately compared with former @entity81 prime minister sir @entity14 , who used a wooden box measuring 4ft by 3ft by 1.5ft to speak to voters in the run - up to his surprise election win in 1992			1
he said at the time : ' people say that you can not do it these days			0
it is fashionable to say , for security and other reasons , that you can not get up on a soapbox			0
i think you have to and i am going to do it			0
' aides to mr @entity3 clearly think the idea should be dusted off again			2
an aide to mr @entity3 insisted there was nothing unusual about the pallet			2
' politicians use platforms so people can see them when they are speaking , ' he said			0
@entity22 has had a @entity11 mp since 1935 , securing a majority of 18,995 in the 2010 general election			2
the campaign push comes as a new poll puts @entity11 on its lowest level of support for a year			1
@entity154 ( right ) was among the people to mistakenly call @entity24 ' during a town centre walkabout ' spot the difference : @entity3 ( left ) was confused with his brother @entity24 ( right ) who resigned as @entity22 mp to take up a job with @entity161 in @entity26 the @entity163 survey found 38 per cent of people backing @entity11 , with the @entity165 on 29 , @entity166 15 and @entity167 10			1
two thirds of people disagree that mr @entity3 is ready to be prime minister , ' significantly ' behind both @entity171 and @entity75 at the same point before they took the keys to @entity174			1
two and a half years before mr @entity171 became @entity175 , 59 per cent said he was ready for the top job while 43 per cent backed @entity75			2
@entity177 , deputy head of political research at @entity93 said : ' @entity11 are at a 12 month low as voters have doubts that @entity3 and his party are ready to move into @entity174			1
' while he does have two years to change their minds , even his own supporters are not yet fully convinced			0
' speaking in @entity22 , mr @entity3 used his address to dispute @entity75 ’s claim yesterday that ‘ we are all @entity108 now ’ because no one would seek to reverse the @entity7 ’s legacy			2
mr @entity3 said : ‘ i do n't agree with him and we are not all @entity108 now , " he said			2
‘ he may have been making the point that there are some things that happened in the 1980s that have not been reversed and people are not planning to reverse			0
‘ but there are lots of things that do need to change , we have learned about deregulation and the problems that creates			0
‘ there 's things about our society that need to change as well so i certainly do n't consider myself to be a thatcherite and there are lots of people in the country who do n't consider themselves to be @entity3 either			1
’ not ready to be pm : a new opinion poll reveals @entity11 at its lowest level for a year , with two thirds of people thinking mr @entity3 is not ready for power safe seat : @entity22 has had a @entity11 mp since 1935 , securing a majority of 18,995 in the 2010 general election more than 30 months after becoming @entity11 leader , beating his brother @entity24 in a bitter contest , it seems voters still have trouble telling them apart – even in @entity22			1
according to reports he had to correct several people , including local resident @entity154 , who mistakenly called him @entity24			1
he told locals : ‘ it 's great to be here in @entity22			0
over the last 11 or 12 years since @entity24 became an mp , i have really enjoyed my visits here			2
’ he later had an ice - cream at @entity235 's parlour			2
last month @entity236 stunned colleagues by confirming he was moving to @entity26 to take up a lucrative job with aid charity , @entity161			1
he made little attempt to hide the fact that his decision stemmed from the 2010 leadership defeat he suffered at the hands of younger brother @entity245 he said it would be better for him to be ‘ 3,000 miles from the front bench ’ , adding : ‘ i did n’t want the soap opera to take over the real substance of what needs to be done			0

@entity3 *mimics* @entity14 's soapbox - with a less impressive platform
campaigning in seat vacated by brother @entity24 for a job in @entity26
new poll puts @entity11 on lowest level of support for a year
two thirds of people do not think @entity3 is ready to be prime minister
