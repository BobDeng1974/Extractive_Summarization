the clock at the @entity1 had ticked on to 60 minutes when , at long last , @entity2 finally got a clear sight of goal			1
@entity5 nodded the ball into @entity8 ’s path and , as he steadied himself , only one outcome looked possible			2
history suggests @entity11 crumble when pressure is applied and this looked like the moment when they would concede			1
standing firm , though , was @entity16			2
@entity8 may have unleashed fury from his right foot , smashing his drive towards the @entity21 net , but @entity16 - so often lampooned for his mistakes - would not be beaten			1
@entity11 goalkeeper @entity16 earned boss @entity24 ' praise during their win at @entity2 @entity2 striker @entity8 ( right ) saw his blistering shot saved by @entity11 's @entity16 ( left ) the @entity28 parried away @entity8 ’s blockbuster before leaping up to punch the loose ball off @entity5 ’s head			1
moments later , when a corner was flung in as @entity2 tried to find a way through , @entity16 came charging out , bulldozing through everyone in front of him to claim possession			1
this was more like it			2
@entity16 has had a poor season , his low point coming when he was dropped for the december 15 trip to @entity42 , but here was a performance to show why he was bought			2
for the first time in a long while , he exuded the authority of a @entity11 no 1			1
‘ i thought he was outstanding , ’ said @entity24			2
‘ @entity16 was n’t overly worked but he made two great saves when called upon			0
but what was really pleasing was how dominant he was			0
@entity8 is nearly unstoppable in the air when he is challenging for the ball			0
but @entity16 came for a number of crosses and got contact with the ball and was really calm and composed and was n’t flustered			0
the team as a whole defended very , very well but i was particularly pleased for him as he has had a wee bit of stick			0
i thought he was excellent			0
’ @entity16 was n’t the only one			0
@entity11 were pushed hard by @entity2 , particularly in the second half , but they were resolute and did n’t look as if they would concede			1
that , certainly , is a sign they are making progress			0
@entity16 ( right ) commanded his penalty area with authority and dealt with aerial balls well at @entity21 defending has been @entity11 ’s achilles heel under @entity24			1
in his first campaign , they kept 21 clean sheets in 54 games			2
last year , there were only 12 shut - outs in 43 matches , while this year the record is seven from 32 fixtures			1
the picture , however , has changed dramatically recently			0
they have not conceded on their last three away trips at @entity84 , @entity85 and @entity2 - the first time they have had such a run since 2008 - and this was the first time they had kept back - to - back clean sheets this campaign			1
that big moment from @entity16 was crucial but so were the contributions of @entity101 , @entity102 and @entity98 , the @entity94 midfielder who has slotted so effortlessly into a role on the right side of a back three			2
@entity103 and @entity104 were also key			0
‘ what a wonderful player he is , ’ @entity24 enthused about can , his £ 10million signing from @entity106			0
‘ he is a central midfield player but [ in defence ] his composure , calmness and strength against @entity8 was very impressive			0
’ bigger tests , of course , must be negotiated in the coming weeks but if @entity11 are to salvage a season that looked to be undermined by a bad back , this defensive renaissance has to continue			1
the free spirits might just be turning into the mean spirits			0
@entity98 ( left ) was another @entity11 player to earn the praise of @entity122 ' boss @entity24 after the match			1

@entity11 won 2 - 0 away at @entity2 in the @entity125 on *saturday*
reds have now not conceded in their last three league away matches
clean sheet was @entity11 's first back - to - back shutout of the season
