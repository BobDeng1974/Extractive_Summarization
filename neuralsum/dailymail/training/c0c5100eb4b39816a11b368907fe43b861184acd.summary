@entity6 and his wife @entity7 were given the @entity8 by the @entity9 as a wedding present , when he was stationed in @entity11 in the early part of his army service from 1958 to 1959			1
the gift was intended as a thank you to @entity11 mrs @entity17 , who had helped the music pioneer 's father @entity18 with translation			2
the record player ( pictured ) owned by @entity5 during his time in the @entity23 in @entity11 made £ 4,400 at auction this week mrs @entity17 had visited the @entity5 's hotel apartment several times to speak to @entity5 at length , as well as going to parties where he would play records and his guitar on the @entity8			1
