@entity1 police have taken the term gun dog to a whole new level - with barking mad results			1
not only has this @entity6 been trained to serve with the @entity1 police force , it has also been entrusted with its very own weapon			2
the animal was seen carrying the automatic in a holster strapped to its side			0
put your paws up ! this dog must feel like the leader of the pack with a gun strapped to its side and its master was even happy to pose with the gun - toting animal			1
witnesses said the armed dog guarded officers as they ate their dinner at the @entity27 in @entity28 , @entity1 , on tuesday			1
the @entity6 certainly looked happy to have risen to such a position of responsibility within the force			0
and to prove he had the right to carry arms , the dog 's holster was marked ' @entity37 '			2
since the photographs emerged online , many people have raised concerns about the safety of the bizarre scene			0
which one 's in charge ? a policeman , who appears unarmed , stands alongside his gun - toting @entity6 however , others questioned whether it was simply a stunt for the camera			1
navies , military forces and police forces tend to use labradors as detection dogs thanks to their calm temperament and keen sense of smell			0
their sense of smell allows them to home in on almost any scent and follow the path of its origin			0
the high intelligence , initiative and self - direction of @entity6 in working roles is exemplified by dogs such as @entity71 , who helped save his master @entity71 's life in 2001 after he had been knocked from his wheelchair by a car			0
he was voted @entity76 and given the @entity78 's coveted @entity77 - the canine equivalent of the @entity80 - for dragging mr @entity71 into the recovery position , pulling a blanket over him and running to a hotel barking for help .			1

the gun - toting police dog was pictured with an officer at a @entity28 hotel
