director @entity0 , a self - proclaimed perfectionist , has made only one change in the re-release of his 1997 blockbuster , @entity4 – and it ’s all thanks to one man			1
@entity8 astrophysicist @entity7 was on @entity0 ’s case for more than a decade trying to have a historically accurate night sky - spoiler alert - in the scenes after the @entity4 sank			1
after several encounters , dr @entity7 got his wish , but first , @entity0 challenged dr @entity7 to send him the exact constellation map for the sky around 4:20am on april 15 , 1912			1
the sky 's the limit : astrophysicist @entity7 , right , convinced titanic director @entity0 , left , to make the night sky historically accurate in the film 's @entity21 release that sinking feeling : dr @entity7 said the sky seen during the night of april 15 , 1912 , was mirrored and incorrect dr @entity7 , who directs the @entity25 for @entity26 and @entity27 at the @entity28 in @entity29 , was happy to oblige ; he sent @entity0 a detailed map of the stars that night , saying astronomy is an easy thing to track			1
he knew something was erroneous when he first watched the film			0
he told @entity36 : ‘ normally , i do n’t concern myself with director ’s errors			0
but the film was marketed how historically accurate the film was – they observed the state rooms and the china patterns			0
he put the effort into making the period piece			0
’ dr @entity7 added : ‘ clearly , you would n’t put @entity47 in striped bell bottoms – and you should n’t do that with the night sky			1
’ he said the star placement in the sky was the wrong sky , and used a mirror reflection to fill in the other half			2
historically , he said , the sky ‘ was cloudless and moonless – we have software you can run that just unwinds the star patterns – you get the right time and the right date , the sky is a very predictable thing , and what birthed our understanding of physics			0
’ up she goes : @entity71 's character @entity69 looked up into a historically inaccurate sky in the scene after the titanic sinks and she and @entity75 are huddled in the wreckage - the most inaccurate scene , according to dr @entity7 what @entity69 saw : though difficult to see , the left - hand portion of the original sky was a mirror image of the right , and furthermore , was not accurate to begin with ; dr @entity7 added that it was cloudless the night of april 15 what @entity69 should see : dr @entity7 said @entity69 should have seen the @entity83 , bottom and centre , as well as @entity86 , which crosses the upper half , based on the coordinates where the @entity4 sank the @entity90 - educated astrophysicist sent @entity0 a letter , and heard no response			1
he then had two personal encounters with the @entity95 director , in which he voiced his complaint – one at a @entity99 committee dinner and another at magazine awards dinner			0
@entity0 first told dr @entity7 that the night sky was completed in post-production			1
dr @entity7 told @entity36 that composing the night sky the way it appeared in the 1997 film was ' not only wrong but lazy			1
' he calculated what the sky would have looked like around 4:20am on april 15 , 1912 by using the approximate latitude and longitude where the ship went down in the @entity111			0
using that data , he was able to render what the night sky would have actually looked like			2
on that night , the sky was cloudless and moonless			0
he said : ' we have software you can run that just unwinds the star patterns - if you get the right time and the right date , the sky is a very predictable thing , and what birthed our understanding of physics			0
' ‘ i really wanted him to grovel and ask forgiveness , ’ dr @entity7 joked , ’ but the mature side of me nodded and i did n’t say anything else			1
’ dr @entity7 composed @entity0 a letter requesting the mistake be rectified , but got no @entity135 was only years later that the two of them happened to be at a dinner together at the @entity139 in @entity29			1
as the night progressed , dr @entity7 mustered the courage to talk to @entity0 , saying : ‘ @entity142 , my issue here is not that the sky was wrong , it was that you got everything else right			1
’ he said @entity0 then told him : ‘ last i checked , @entity4 has grossed $ 1.3billion			0
imagine how much more money the film would have grossed if i would have gotten the sky correct			0
’ in response to the comment , @entity0 told @entity154 magazine @entity153 that he did , in fact , make the one change			2
he said : ‘ @entity7 sent me quite a snarky email saying that , at that time of year , in that position in the @entity111 in 1912 , when @entity69 is lying on the piece of driftwood and staring up at the stars , that is not the star field she would have seen			2
‘ and with my reputation as a perfectionist , i should have known that and i should have put the right star field in			0
’ dr @entity7 said his tenacity finally paid off , saying that he was ‘ nipping at his heels ’ for ten years			2
the new @entity21 version of @entity4 – complete with the astronomically correct night sky – will be out later this week			2
stars align : @entity0 first told dr @entity7 that the stars were added in post-production			1

@entity90 - trained astrophysicist dr @entity7 said @entity69 looks up at wrong night sky in *famous* scene
after several attempts , @entity0 said he *'d* change it if @entity7 provided correct configuration
