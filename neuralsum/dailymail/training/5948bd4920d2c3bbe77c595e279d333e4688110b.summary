the scene : @entity6 , 49 , from @entity7 , @entity8 , died when his craft plunged to the ground , probably after stalling following a steep climb the investigation concluded the crash happened because mr @entity6 had attempted a solo flight without the required training microlight pilots are required to hold a licence that takes a minimum of 25 flight hours to achieve			1
the crash , in a field in the @entity32 near @entity33 on april 12 , happened after mr @entity6 took off , leaving two friends on the ground			1
one of them was an experienced microlight pilot , although not an instructor , who helped taxi the aircraft into position			2
the @entity14 said mr @entity6 had bought the microlight last autumn , but the @entity43 was not notified and it was deregistered in december			1
the 23 - year - old aircraft was in good condition , despite not having been officially inspected for three years			0
the @entity14 also found no record of mr @entity6 taking a formal flying training course and he did not have the required medical declaration for flying a microlight			1
the @entity14 said : ' there was some anecdotal evidence that the owner had taken lessons , but the provider was not traced and it is not known how many lessons were undertaken or if the person delivering them was a qualified instructor			0
' mr @entity6 was also not a member of a microlight club			1
the @entity14 said he may have had ' only limited experience of flying as a passenger '			2
he had flown in another microlight before buying his own , but had not operated the controls			0
the @entity14 report stated : ' immediately after takeoff , the weight - shift microlight entered a steep climb			0
' the nose then dropped ( probably as a result of a stall ) and the aircraft struck the ground in a steep nose - down attitude			0
' it is probable that the owner did not vise the correct takeoff technique and allowed the wing to remain in a high angle of attack			0
' the rapid nose drop probably occurred as the result of a stall , which may have been exacerbated by the reduction in power			0
' the resulting nose - down attitude , with the possible subsequent addition of power so close to the ground , would have made recovery difficult			0
' the investigation also found no ballast on the rear seat , which is recommended by the aircraft manufacturer when the micro-light is flown solo			0
the report said a post-mortem examination found mr @entity6 died of multiple injuries , but there was no evidence of drugs , alcohol or natural disease			2
an ambulance spokesman said at the time of crash : ' paramedics at the scene estimated that the microlight had come down from a height of between 200ft to 300ft			2

@entity6 , 49 , plunged 300ft to ground as he flew craft alone
the @entity115 had no record of taking a formal flying training course
but microlight pilots must have licence that takes 25 flight hours to achieve
