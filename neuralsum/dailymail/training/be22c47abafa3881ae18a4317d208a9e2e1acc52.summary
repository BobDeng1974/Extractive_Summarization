@entity9 - resident @entity8 told her traumatic story to @entity11 , revealing details about the night she offered to drive a stranger to the hospital before ' he physically and sexually attacked her '			1
ms @entity8 says she fought back and escaped with her life , but two spinal surgeries later , she still ca n't use her right arm or walk on her own			1
and since she 's uninsured , she already owes one hospital $ 250,000 and is about to be kicked out of a third			1
survivor : 26 - year - old @entity8 survived a horrific attack late last month when she offered to drive a stranger to the hospital it all goes back to december 20 when ms @entity8 was in @entity23 , @entity24 , to support her brother as he underwent open heart surgery at @entity27			1
arrested : 23 - year - old @entity28 is currently facing charges in @entity8 's attack			1
he was found semi-conscious in her car with a pistol she was smoking a cigarette in the car at the nearby @entity35 around 4am when she was approached by 23 - year - old @entity28 who asked her for a cigarette and the two started talking about their relatives in the hospital			1
@entity28 told her he was worried about his uncle at the hospital and wondered if she would n’t mind driving him up there so he could see him			2
‘ yeah i ’ll give you a ride if you promise not to hurt me , ’ she joked , agreeing to drive him since the hospital was only four minutes away and @entity28 was clean cut , well - spoken and well dressed			1
‘ who could hurt that precious face ? ’ ms @entity8 recalls him responding			1
as they drove up to the hospital , ms @entity8 began to turn into the main entrance but @entity28 told her it was a different entrance			1
the second entrance was the emergency entrance and he told her not to turn there either , she told @entity11			0
from there the road went pitch black and when ms @entity8 turned to tell him she did n’t think there was another entrance , he allegedly hit her face with the mouth of his gun			1
ms @entity8 says she started to cry and begged him to take her car or her money , but she says he told her to just keep driving and hit her on the head with his pistol			1
she agreed and started driving but slowly moved her hand to the door handle			0
she hit the gas right before she opened the door and hurled herself out of the moving vehicle			0
by the time she stopped rolling and got up , @entity28 had somehow put the car in park and caught up with her , she said			2
outside of the car , she says he pointed his gun at her and forced her to perform oral sex			0
‘ i kept begging him not to rape me , ’ she said			0
hoping to save herself , she offered to drive him to an atm and give him all the money in her bank account			2
totaled : @entity8 tried to escape by reversing her @entity83 towards the emergency hospital area			2
it hit a tree and the crash caused @entity28 to pass out ‘ i lied and told him i had thousands of dollars in my bank account			2
i did n’t have thousands of dollars , ’ she said			0
‘ i knew if i kept driving i was going to die , so i put the car in reverse and aimed for the emergency hospital area			0
’ according to ms @entity8 , @entity28 tried to stop her , continuing to hit her on the head with his pistol before moving over onto her lap to try to control the car			1
the two were fighting over the wheel and the car propelled into a tree , totalling the $ 8,000 @entity83 she just paid off			0
even though the crash happened right in front of the hospital , no one seemed to notice the crash so when she came to , @entity8 was still alone in the car with @entity28 – trapped underneath him from their struggle			1
the bill : since the attack , uninsured @entity8 has been treated at three hospitals and already racked up a $ 250,000 bill already she says it took nearly half an hour to move his weight off her without waking him			1
she decided it was safer to climb out the window than open the door which she thought would wake him up as well			0
after falling out of the car she crawled to a bush to hide , and eventually a car went by that brought her to the hospital			0
survivor : friends of the 26 - year - old are currently raising money online for cover some of her medical bills while @entity8 was being treated at the hospital , police arrived on the scene and found @entity28 still in the car , semi-conscious with the pistol			1
@entity28 was arrested and is facing charges of kidnapping , criminal sexual conduct , unlawful carrying of a pistol and possession of a weapon with the commission of a crime			2
ms @entity8 , who is still recovering from the accident at a rehabilitation center , describes the experience as horrific and says she still continually wakes up with night terrors			1
' it 's been awful			0
it 's been the most painful , traumatic experience of my life			0
the man ruined my life , ' she said			0
but it was just the beginning of the nightmare			0
doctors treated ms @entity8 at @entity23 before transferring her to @entity159 in @entity160 , @entity161 where she underwent two spinal surgeries			1
at first , doctors said she would never be able to walk again and though there ’s now hope that she ’ll regain some of that movement , at the very least she ’ll have to carry a cane for the rest of her life			0
because she is uninsured , she was dismissed from the second hospital but her victim advocate was able to secure her transfer to a $ 2,000 a day rehab facility for a free 10 day stay which she started on friday			2
@entity8 says she was told she needs at least four months of rehab to regain skills like writing again , but has to do as much as she can with the 10 days she has			2
‘ i ca n’t write , i ca n’t dress myself , i ca n’t do anything , i ca n’t brush my teeth by myself , i have to relearn , ’ she said			0
it also does n't help that she wo n't soon be able to go back to her job at a storage facility , since she ca n't type or move			0
she has n’t gotten the bill from the @entity23 hospital yet , but the total for @entity184 is already 250,000			2
friends and family have started an online campaign to raise $ 100,000 to cover some of her medical bills			0
as of early sunday , they had raised over $ 9,000 of that goal .			0

@entity8 , 26 , says she offered to give @entity28 , 23 , a ride to the hospital
she claims he then attacked and sexually assaulted her , but she was able to escape
@entity28 was arrested and has been charged
ms @entity8 is still being treated for her injuries and may never be able to walk again
she is also uninsured and has already racked up one $ 250,000 hospital bill
