@entity0 , the world 's largest online retailer , attracted the attention of the @entity4 administration yesterday when it announced that it will be adding 7,000 @entity6 workers to it 's payroll			1
president @entity4 is set to visit the 1 million square foot ' fulfillment warehouse ' in @entity9 , @entity10 this afternoon - which was the single biggest job creator in the state when it opened in 2011			1
mr @entity4 plans to speak about middle - class jobs , which makes the @entity0 backdrop surprising			1
full - time positions : @entity0 is focused on speeding up order fulfillment , so 5,000 of the positions will be at distribution centers in 10 states @entity0 says it pays 30 per cent more than the $ 10 an hour median for retail workers			1
but even at $ 13 an hour , that 's only a $ 27,000 a year salary			0
according to the @entity25 , the current three - person middle - class household brings in $ 69,487 in annual income			0
two adults working at @entity0 for $ 13 an hour would n't make the cut for that definition of middle class			2
and $ 13 an hour may be pushing it , since the @entity32 estimated yesterday that the company pays closer to $ 11 an hour for jobs in picking , packing and shipping orders			2
that 's where most of the hiring will be in the next few months , as the company looks to beef up staff at warehouses where it fills orders			2
positions available : the company is hiring a total of 7,000 new employees at facilities in 13 states five - thousand of the jobs will be at @entity0 's @entity6 distribution centers , which currently employ about 20,000 workers who pack and ship customer orders			1
the company has been spending heavily on order fulfillment , a strategy meant to help the business grow , but one that has also weighed on profit margins			1
the company said last week that it lost money in the second quarter , even as revenue increased			0

; @entity9 and @entity82 , @entity10 ; @entity83 , @entity84 and @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity87 , @entity88			2
special visitor : president @entity4 is set to visit an @entity0 facility in @entity9 , @entity10 today the company is also adding 2,000 jobs in customer service , including full - time , part - time and seasonal			1

growing : @entity0 will be hiring 2,000 workers for their customer service division these 7,000 new @entity0 employees will definitely perk up the oil industry , which has been seeing a drop in the price of gasoline			1
more workers means more drivers , and a higher demand for oil			0
' we 'll look to position ourselves for friday 's number and get a better gauge one how fast demand is growing and going , ' @entity116 and opinions said in a commentary			0
' i think that demand is definitely more correlated to the number of people , which in turn leads to a lot more drivers			0
