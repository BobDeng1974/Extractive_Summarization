it was the most hi - tech road trip ever attempted			1
@entity1 has completed the longest automated drive in the @entity3 , travelling from @entity4 to @entity5 in the first coast - to - coast trip ever attempted by an automated vehicle			1
nearly 3,400 miles were covered with 99 percent of the drive in fully automated mode			2
the nine - day trip crossed 15 states and the @entity12			2
along the way , the vehicle encountered complex driving situations such as traffic circles , construction zones , bridges , tunnels , aggressive drivers and a variety of weather conditions			0
the team collected nearly three terabytes of data — about 30 percent of all of the printed material in the @entity26			0
the drive was used by @entity1 engineers to research and collect information that will help further advance active safety technology – the most rapidly growing technology sector of the auto industry			1
the team collected nearly three terabytes of data — about 30 percent of all of the printed material in the @entity26			0
' our vehicle performed remarkably well during this drive , exceeding our expectations , ' said @entity38 , @entity1 chief technology officer			2
' the knowledge obtained from this trip will help optimize our existing active safety products and accelerate our future product development , which will allow us to deliver unsurpassed automotive grade technologies to our customers			0

@entity1 , one of the largest suppliers of automotive electronics and safety systems , is using the long journey in the @entity63 crossover to acquire real - world data from a sophisticated array of cameras , radar and lidar - a laser mapping technology - as well as wireless connected - vehicle technology			2
the firm also wants to test and demonstrate its active safety systems , which are being developed with such suppliers as @entity73 , an @entity75 maker of computer vision and collision avoidance systems , and software provider @entity78 , a spinout from @entity81 's self - driving car program			1
@entity1 's demonstration underscores growing interest and investments by automakers and suppliers in self - driving cars , some of which could be production - ready by 2020			1
@entity38 , @entity1 's chief technology officer , sees the automated driver assistance systems in the @entity63 as building blocks on the road to fully self - driving cars in the next decade			1
the @entity1 drivebegan march 22 near @entity4 's @entity94 , with plans to wind up in @entity5 just before the annual auto show opens there on april 3			1
during the coast - to - coast journey in the @entity63 , at least two @entity1 engineers will be aboard , including one behind the wheel			2
@entity1 , a former @entity100 unit domiciled in the @entity101 , will test such functions as traffic jam assist , automated highway pilot with lane change and automated parking and valet			0
all of those systems are expected to be introduced in production cars over the next two to three years			0
although automakers and suppliers will have such capability within the next five years , @entity110 said , ' our view is that the driver is going to be in the seat for a long time ' in case of emergency situations that self - driving systems may not be equipped or programmed to handle			1

fully automated systems that may be phased in after 2020 could add about $ 5,000 to the cost of a car , estimates @entity129 , vice president of advanced and product engineering for @entity1 's electronics and safety division			1
@entity1 is providing some of the components and technology , including vehicle - to - vehicle connectivity , for @entity100 's @entity137 automated driving system , which will debut in 2016 on the new @entity139 sedan			1
during the cross-country trek , the vehicle will be challenged under a variety of driving conditions from changing weather and terrain to potential road hazards -- things that could never truly be tested in a lab. ' @entity1 had great success testing its car in @entity151 and on the streets of @entity153 , ' said @entity110			0
' now it 's time to put our vehicle to the ultimate test by broadening the range of driving conditions			1
' this drive will help us collect invaluable data in our quest to deliver the best automotive grade technologies on the market			0

drive began on march 22 near @entity4 's @entity94
car arrived in @entity5 today - before auto show opens on april 3
@entity171 used a *specially* *adapted* @entity172 and drove itself 90 *%* of the time
