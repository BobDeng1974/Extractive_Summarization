by @entity0 @entity2 's attempt to halt a fraud trial by saying legal aid cuts meant the defendants would n't get a fair trial has failed a judge 's decision to throw out a multimillion - pound fraud trial after defendants said they could n't afford adequate representation has been overturned by the @entity13			1
the prime minister 's barrister brother , @entity14 , had successfully argued that the £ 5million scam case should be thrown out because of legal aid reforms introduced by his sibling 's government			1
he said that controversial @entity21 ( @entity21 ) reforms meant the five defendants could not find barristers of ' sufficient competence ' , and the case was halted at the beginning of this month			1
but today three judges quashed the ruling , insisting that the trial go ahead			1
their decision came after @entity33 watchdog the @entity31 ( @entity31 ) urged @entity34 , @entity35 , and @entity36 to overturn the decision taken by judge @entity38 at @entity40 's @entity39 on 1 may			1
the trial , which involves the alleged mis - selling of land to members of the public , is a so - called @entity45 ( @entity45 )			2
the government has cut fees for such long and complex cases by 30 per cent for barristers and solicitors			0
judge @entity38 had said that adjourning the case til next year , as requested by the prosecution , would clog up the courts and would not help the defendants find lawyers to represent them			1
as a result , he ruled , they would not be guaranteed a fair trial , and so he ordered that the case be ' stayed '			2
however the @entity31 appealed his decision , arguing that the judge ' erred in principle ' and ' came to an unreasonable decision '			1
today , sir @entity65 said he and his fellow judges agreed , saying : ' this ruling does involve errors of law or principle and , in any event , was not reasonable '			2
if the appeal had failed , the defendants - @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity77 , who are charged with conspiracy to defraud - would have been acquitted			0
sir @entity65 said : ' during the course of the hearing , we made it clear that the dispute between the @entity84 and the lord chancellor about the appropriate level of remuneration for @entity88 was not one in which we could , or should , become involved			0
the trial , involving an alleged £ 5million property scam , will now go ahead at @entity40 's @entity39 sir @entity34 said the original judge 's decision to halt the multi-million pound trial was erroneous ' it involves a commercial negotiation in which , short of legal challenge , the judiciary can play no part			1
' after the ruling , the @entity31 said it ' welcomed ' the @entity13 's decision			1
@entity2 , who is representing seven defendants free of charge , argued that his legally aided clients could not find barristers ' of sufficient competence '			0
the case involves @entity73 , 35 , who is said to have masterminded a £ 5million scam between 2008 and 2011 through the firms @entity110 @entity111 , @entity112 ( @entity113 ) and @entity114			1
he is accused alongside @entity75 , 30 , @entity115 , 27 , @entity76 , 46 , @entity116 , 24 , @entity117 , 28 , and @entity77 , 38 , of conspiracy to defraud			0
the eighth defendant , solicitor @entity74 , 53 , is facing fraud charges and an allegation of money laundering in relation to the case			2
the charges arose out of @entity126 , a @entity31 investigation into the activities of the land banking firms			2
legal aid costs about £ 2billion a year , half of which goes on criminal defence with the other half going to civil cases including mental health , asylum and family law			0
last year , the government cut fees for legal aid in @entity142 ( @entity88 ) by 30 per cent , and fees for other @entity145 work by up to 18 per cent			0
this sparked a series of protests from the legal profession , with opponents arguing that complex cases need experienced lawyers ( with fees to match ) and saying the cuts will affect defendants ' right to a fair trial			2
opposition : cutting the annual £ 2billion legal aid bill sparked a wave of protests from angry lawyers however , recent figures released under the @entity164 showed that 20 of the highest - paid legal aid barristers in @entity166 and @entity167 shared nearly £ 8.5m for defending alleged criminals unable to fund their own defences			0
the @entity21 has defended its decision to cut costs , saying : ' we have one of the most expensive legal aid systems in the world			0
' we have reduced the cost of a small number of the longest running criminal cases by 30 per cent - just one of these cases recently cost more than £ 8 million in legal aid			0
' we want to ensure the limited money we have for legal aid is concentrated on those cases and people who need it most			0

@entity14 said fraud trial should be halted as it was n't fair
judge @entity38 agreed with him and the case was halted on may 1
but the @entity31 appealed decision , and has now *won*
three judges quashed judge @entity38 's decision , and trial will resume
it involves eight defendants and an alleged £ 5million property scam
@entity34 , one of the judges , said the decision to halt trial was *wrong*
