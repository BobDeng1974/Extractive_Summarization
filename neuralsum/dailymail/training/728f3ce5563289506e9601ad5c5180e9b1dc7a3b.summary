by @entity0 published : 17:35 est , 24 july 2013 updated : 19:12 est , 24 july 2013 a 37 - year - old has become the first cyclist to be convicted of manslaughter after he struck and killed a 71 - year - old pedestrian after running a stop sign			2
@entity6 was cycling through a busy intersection when he plowed into @entity8 , who was crossing the street with his wife in downtown @entity11			1
his conviction today is the first of its kind for a cyclist in the @entity16 he was sentenced to 1,000 hours of community service and three years on probation after pleading guilty to vehicular manslaughter			1
the light had already turned red when he crashed into the group of pedestrians even though he claimed it was yellow			2
after the 2012 accident , @entity6 wrote about it on a cycling chat forum and was blasted for making excuses for what he did and making jokes about his helmet			1
the post , which has since been removed , said : ' the light turned yellow as i was approaching the intersection , but i was already way too committed to stop			1
' the light turned red as i was cruising through the middle of the intersection and then , almost instantly , the southern crosswalk on @entity53 and @entity54 filled up with people coming from both directions ... so , in a nutshell , blammo			2
' the poster , ' @entity59 ' , who identified himself as the man responsible for the crash , then continued to recount the final few moments before the fatal collision			1
' i could n't see a line through the crowd and i could n't stop , so i laid it down and just plowed through the crowded crosswalk in the least - populated place i could find , ' he said			2
' i do n't remember the next five minutes but when i came to , i was in a neck brace being loaded into an ambulance			2
i remember seeing a river of blood on the asphalt , but it was n't mine			2
' apparently i hit a 71 - year - old male pedestrian and he ended up in the @entity76 with pretty serious head injuries			1
i really hope he ends up ok			0
' tragic : @entity6 smashed into 71 - year - old @entity8 , who later died , at a busy @entity11 intersection , and then identified himself as the rider in the crash on an internet forum widowed : @entity8 's wife @entity82 , who was a witness to the accident , says she is at a loss without her husband , adding that he was her best friend but what has created the most outrage among internet users is the way the @entity90 ended his post , after detailing the seriousness of the injuries sustained by the man he had hit			1
' in closing , i want to dedicate this story to my late helmet			1
she died in heroic fashion today as my head slammed into the tarmac ... may she die knowing that because she committed the ultimate sacrifice , her rider and live and ride on			1
can i get an amen ? amen			0
' one user , who posted under the name hssrinsf , wrote on website @entity108 : ' @entity111 , the guy was 71 years old			1
whether it was red , green or yellow , he was going way too fast if he was n't able to stop in time			0
' another , who posted under the name @entity117 , said : ' it takes just one f * * * in jerk like @entity59 to give a bad name to the countless other bikers whom obey laws and ride safely			0
' and one person , who posted under the name @entity126 , said : ' your irresponsibility injured ( and ultimately killed ) a man and you took to the internet to tell your story ? yeah , you deserve jail time jackass			0
' ' our goal is to send a message to cyclists about safety , ' @entity134 said on tuesday			0
' just because you are riding a bicycle does n't mean all bets are off			0
all of the rules of the road that apply to everyone else apply to you too			0
' location : the intersection at @entity148 streets , in @entity11 , where the fatal accident took place @entity90 's attorney , @entity151 , released a statement after the incident saying : ' @entity59 is devastated by the accident last thursday and by the tragic death of @entity8			1
' @entity59 believes that he entered the intersection lawfully and that he did everything possible to avoid the accident			1
his heart goes out to mr @entity8 's wife and family for their loss			0
' but @entity8 's wife , @entity82 , who was with him at the time of the crash , told how she saw her injured husband covered in blood and how she is at a loss without him			0
' i heard something ... and i turned around and my husband was [ lying ] down on the floor , ' she told @entity174			0
' he was a wonderful guy , he was not only a husband for me , he was my best friend			0
' the family have filed a civil suit against him			0
