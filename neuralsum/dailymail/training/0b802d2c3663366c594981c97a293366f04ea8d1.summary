by @entity0 last updated at 7:44 pm on 6th december 2011 the norovirus outbreak at @entity5 's @entity4 restaurant in @entity6 , @entity1 left hundreds of people unwell a norovirus outbreak linked to oysters served by @entity5 's @entity4 restaurant may have been worse because he delayed notifying health chiefs			2
the concern is identified in a major investigation into the outbreak that left hundreds of people ill after eating at the restaurant which has three @entity19 stars			2
the study , conducted by experts from the @entity22 ( @entity22 ) , also found that staff continued to work , preparing food , despite being ill or potentially contagious			1
@entity25 , which leads to vomiting and diarrhoea , is highly contagious - and the outbreak at the @entity4 in 2009 was the biggest ever recorded involving a single restaurant			0
subsequently , it has emerged most oysters sourced from @entity32 waters are contaminated with low levels of norovirus , probably linked to sewage outfalls			2
diners , including a number of celebrities , fell ill after eating from a special ' tasting menu ' at the restaurant , specifically an oyster , passion fruit jelly and lavender dish			1
the @entity22 study reveals that the celebrity chef , famed for his chemistry set gastronomy , did not contact health authorities until six weeks after the first case of norovirus was reported			1
rather than alerting public health authorities to get help in tracking the source , the chef brought in private consultants to investigate			1
it was only after they were unable to find the cause that the chef voluntarily shut down the @entity4 , ordered a deep clean and finally called in the @entity22 and local council			1
diners , including a number of celebrities , fell ill after eating from a special ' tasting menu ' at the restaurant in 2009 , specifically an oyster , passion fruit jelly and lavender dish ( file photo ) by this time , the chef and his team had received 66 complaints of illness , while several hundred more subsequently emerged			1
significantly , in a study published in the journal @entity75 , the @entity22 investigators highlight the delay and point out this could have left diners vulnerable			1
it concluded : ' delayed notification of the outbreak to public health authorities may have contributed to outbreak size and duration			0
' eventually , some 591 people reported feeling ill after eating at the restaurant in january and february 2009 , while the experts were confident that at least 240 were likely to have contracted norovirus			1
as well as diners , a number of staff fell ill , either through eating or handling the contaminated oysters			1
in 2010 , mr @entity5 told the @entity93 that the restaurant had a training manual that ensures staff who fall ill do not return to work until at least 48 hours after symptoms have disappeared			1
@entity22 experts found that the restaurant ordered a deep clean before notifying health authorities , which made it difficult for them to identify the source of the illness however , the @entity22 study found : ' of those staff reporting illness , six reported working while unwell ... nine reported returning to work prior to being asymptomatic for 48 hours and all without negative laboratory tests			1
' this also raised the risk to customers			0
the study concluded : ' the on - going risk from dining at the restaurant may have been due to persistent contamination of the oyster supply alone or in combination with further spread via infected food handlers or the restaurant environment			2
' the experts found that the restaurant ordered a deep clean before notifying health authorities , which made it difficult for the authorities to identify the source of the illness			0
they said : ' a ' deep cleaning ' exercise of the premises had been conducted immediately after closure and preceding notification of authorities , thus severely limiting the potential findings from environmental sampling as the environmental samples were taken one week after closure			0
' the @entity4 has faced a number of legal claims from diners who fell ill , including the tv sports presenter @entity142 , who was left ' disastrously ' sick			2
he and his wife , who had been eating with boxing promoter @entity145 and three other guests , spent a total of Â£ 1,346.33 on a ' gastronomic evening ' which turned to ' catastrophe '			0
@entity5 has cooked for notable people such as the @entity151 , pictured grimacing as he makes ice cream using liquid nitrogen research published by the @entity155 last week found that 76 per cent of oysters tested from @entity32 waters contained norovirus at a low level			2
mr @entity5 has refused to serve oysters at his restaurant since the outbreak because he can not be sure that they will be free from contamination			0
last night , a spokesman for his restaurant said : ' we are satisfied with all our procedures that were in place and strongly refute any accusations of wrongdoing			0
' we co-operated with all parties fully and transparently and received a clean bill of health to re-open after a ten - day investigation			0
' we also received full support by our insurers who found no fault in our practices following a report from a leading @entity32 independent specialist			0
' there is still no guaranteed safety measure in place today to protect the general public with regards to shellfish and viral contamination			0
' for this reason we still do not serve oysters or razor clams at @entity4			0

chef used private consultants to investigate first
@entity22 study found staff continued to work despite being ill
at least 240 diners likely to have contracted norovirus
