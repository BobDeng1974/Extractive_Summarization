for ice fisherman looking to quench their thirst and warm their bodies in frozen conditions , a drone delivering beer seemed like the perfect idea			0
but now the @entity9 has ruled @entity10 , based at @entity11 , @entity12 , can no longer operate their test aircraft to deliver beverages to fishermen , after raising safety concerns			1
@entity17 , which calls itself ' the fisherman 's lager ' , had hoped to use the pilotless aircraft to potentially deliver drinks to thousands of anglers trying their luck in icy conditions			2
a clerk would then take their order and ship the box of 12 brews to whichever ice - house requested it			0
a video showing the brewers testing out the idea on @entity47 went viral after it was posted last week and has now gathered 85,000 views			0
but the government ruled that the company 's next test , which was set for @entity53 's @entity52 and the @entity55 resort can not proceed			2
' we were a little surprised at the @entity9 interest in this since we thought we were operating under the 400 - foot limit , ' said @entity17 managing partner @entity60 via email to @entity62 via email			2
he added that the beer - makers ' figured a vast frozen lake was a lot safer place than [ what ] @entity68 was showing on 60 minutes			0
' in december , @entity68 founder @entity70 revealed his company 's plans to use drones for same - day delivery			2
served cold : @entity75 wanted to develop a way of delivering the beer based on a person 's gps coordinates but the @entity9 rules do not allow drones to be used for commercial delivery , although it has scheduled a review			1
following the publication of @entity87 's viral video , the @entity9 contacted the firm to say it broke numerous regulations , ranging from the operator 's rating to the use of airspace			1
although disappointed , @entity94 understands the @entity9 's concern			1
' drones whizzing around piloted by any knucklehead is probably not the @entity99 future we all imagined			0
' in a statement to @entity103 , he added : ' they think it ’s a great idea , though they ’re telling me to stop			0
' there are also other issues with the idea that need to be worked out , including checking buyers ' ids to ensure that they are not underage and developing drones that can carry a 12 pack further than half a mile			1
in the meantime , beer drone supporters have begun a @entity119 petition to get the aircraft airborne again			0
launch : a sales clerk attaches a case of 12 beers to the drone and gets ready for blast off up , up and away : the test drone takes the beer off for delivery the future : these drones could be the new way of delivering beer or other goods - if the @entity9 allows it flying high : the drone soars over the lake of ice - houses and thirsty fisherman prepare for landing : the drone zeros in on the selected destination touchdown : the beer safely lands on the ground following the test drone flight			1

@entity9 ruled @entity147 can not operate drones over safety concerns
brewery tested out drones on @entity153 that can deliver beer based on a person 's gps coordinates
but agency rules drones can not be used for commercial purposes
@entity9 has now scheduled a review of regulations regarding drones
