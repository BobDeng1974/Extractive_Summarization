@entity0 has admitted that he fears for the future of his three children who are half @entity3 – because uncontrolled immigration risks causing ‘ tensions ’ in @entity6			1
the health secretary said he was worried that mounting anger against migrants would mean his @entity3 wife and their children would face hostility for using the @entity14			1
he warned that unless the level of immigration was brought back under control , the @entity6 would have to face up to the sort of ‘ social divisions ’ that had tarnished other countries			0
mr @entity0 said that if the @entity14 did not get better at tackling ‘ health tourism ’ , the country may not be able to afford decent care for everyone			1
at least £ 500million a year is being lost because hospitals do not ask many foreigners to pay for the care they receive , he said			1
he made his hard - hitting warnings about immigration in a phone - in programme hosted by @entity47 on @entity48			0
‘ i ’d like to make one general point about immigration , ’ he said			0
‘ my wife is @entity3 and she obviously lives with me in @entity52			1
‘ my children are half @entity3 and i do not want them to grow up in a country where people look at immigrants and say it ’s difficult for me to access @entity14 services because of people like you			1
‘ and that ’s why it ’s so important to have sensible , balanced , controlled immigration in this country			0
because otherwise we ’ll have social divisions , we ’ll have tensions , which thankfully in this country we ’ve avoided for many years unlike other countries			2
’ mr @entity0 met his wife , @entity30 , six years ago at a conference in @entity52 where she was working as a recruiter for @entity3 students			1
their children are @entity73 , four , @entity74 , two , and @entity75 , who was born in july			0
his warning has come after the @entity77 failed to meet their election pledge to cut immigration to the ‘ tens of thousands ’			0
although immigration from outside the @entity83 has been cut , the @entity81 has been unable to tackle immigration from the continent because of freedom of movement rules			0
@entity0 , wife @entity30 and two of their children at a wedding in 2012 @entity92 has vowed to claw back powers over our borders from the @entity83 ahead of an in / out referendum by the end of 2017			2
last week , defence secretary @entity98 warned that some communities felt ‘ swamped ’ and ‘ under siege ’ from migrants			2
senior doctors have warned of the disastrous effect of ‘ health tourism ’ on the @entity14 , with people coming to @entity6 to access free cancer , @entity106 , kidney and infertility treatment			1
mr @entity0 added : ‘ it is a @entity110 and not an @entity111 and we have to do something about this – we are doing something about this			0
we simply ca n’t afford to give everyone free medical care			2
it is important to say that 40 per cent of doctors in the @entity14 are from an ethnic minority and we benefit massively from foreign nurses , foreign doctors			0
’ but mr @entity0 said the @entity14 was not good enough at collecting money from foreigners , who ‘ do n’t have a right to free care on the @entity14 ’			1
but he added , however , that action was being taken , such as ‘ stopping the issuing of @entity14 numbers to anyone who turns up in a gp surgery ’ .			0
