by @entity1 reporter published : 20:02 est , 26 january 2014 updated : 14:25 est , 27 january 2014 a lawyer acting for a high school girl who threw a wild party at the home of a family for whom she was cat - sitting says a text message received from the family indicated to the teen that it was ok for her to have friends over			1
@entity13 says the 17 - year - old @entity15 student agreed to look after the @entity7 's seven cats while the family were away from their home in @entity20			1
@entity13 claims the text message gave the teen the impression that she was welcome to invite friends over to the house on @entity25 , where her school friend @entity26 , 18 , and her father @entity29 and mother @entity28 live			2
] heard the @entity49 interview went well ! ' reports the @entity50			0
this apparently gave the girl to understand that she could invite some friends over and she asked two girlfriends over to keep her company			2
@entity13 says that the girl then went on a babysitting job and that it was one of the friends who invited the rest of the teenagers , who caused thousands of dollars of damage to the house and stole jewelry and $ 6,000 cash			1
@entity28 told the @entity50 that the message was sent in jest and that her meaning was the exact opposite of her words			0
in case there was any confusion , @entity28 says she had her daughter also text the teen , saying ' no [ expletive ] parties in the home , ' sent just before the family left for their dream vacation to @entity79 to celebrate @entity81 's graduation and her impending study at the @entity83			1
upon their return from vacation though , the family discovered that their home had indeed been the scene of a bacchanal of huge proportions			2
used condoms litter the floors and puddle of vomit , urine and feces were found in beds , reports the @entity50			2
there was graffiti and even holes in the walls as wells cash and jewelry missing			2
@entity13 says the teen can not be held responsible for the actions of the almost 50 teenage partygoers who were at the home on december 27			0
if anything , he says , she is also a victim of the circumstances , rather than an instigator			0
' this is a young lady who is an honor student , applied to @entity117 colleges , has exceptional sat scores and has no criminal record whatsoever			0
zero , ' @entity13 said			0
' we have fully cooperated with the police , given a list of the people at the party to the police and the family			2
they have also notified their homeowners insurance policy and gotten a claim number for the @entity131 , ' the attorney said			0
the girl returned from her babysitting job and tried to herd everyone out of the house , a feat she achieved at 1am			0
she came clean to her parents about the party the following afternoon			0
' at 1:45 p.m. , she texted us that she had lied , ' the mother told the @entity50 , ' that there had been a mob at the house the night before and she was cleaning up and needed our help			0
she said she had n’t slept because she was so upset and got up early in the morning and went back there to clean			0
' several kids came and helped for about an hour in the morning			0
we went over and there was vomit everywhere , broken furniture and dirt and mess			0
we helped her vacuum , do laundry and take out trash and broken glass … ' the girl 's family says that her own savings will be used to reimburse the family for the damage done , but that @entity29 's request for $ 8,500 for the cost of the holiday is unreasonable			1
@entity29 wants the money reimbursed because the family 's holiday was ruined by the actions of the girl			1
gross : the homeowners found urine , feces and vomit all over their house @entity29 and @entity173 say they have had to initiate all contact with the cat sitter and her family and had no idea that they had retained the services of a lawyer			1
when @entity29 asked the teen 's parents to pay for the damages , they offered him $ 90 , which would n't even begin to cover the thousands of dollars worth of damage done to the house , the jewelry that was stolen , or the $ 6,000 in cash that was taken from the house			1
when @entity29 and his family entered their home , they found the mother of the cat - sitter standing in their foyer next to a vacuum cleaner			1
she explained that there was a problem with one of the beds and that she had taken the liberty of taking a comforter and two rugs to a professional cleaner			0
but @entity81 - still confused as to why there was thousands of dollars in damage to his home , as well as urine and vomit everywhere - wanted to know what caused all of the damage			1
' what the hell happened ? ' he asked the girl 's mother			0
friends of the 17 - year - old cat - sitter , who the family describes as a ' trusted friend ' of their daughter , from many of the area 's elite private schools - with names like @entity15 , @entity232 , @entity233 had converged on the home			1
as if the urine feces and vomit was n't bad enough , @entity29 tells the @entity50 that he also found used condoms scattered throughout the house			1
then video of the teens destroying the house started popping up on social media websites			2
in one of the videos , a male was seen urinating on 18 - year - old @entity26 's bed - as another teen is narrating , saying ' this is for you			1
' ' the destruction to our house is considerable			0
there was human feces , urine and vomit in numerous locations			2
every floor in the house was rifled			0
there was broken furniture and there were multiple used condoms , ' @entity29 told the paper , as he and his wife explained that it was n't until last week that the stench from the december 27 party was finally gone			1
' it took an industrial strength cleaning to get rid of the odors of urine and vomit , and we keep discovering more , ' @entity29 said			2
' i do n’t know that i wo n’t open a box in my attic at some point and discover more vomit			0
' according to @entity29 , the cats the 17 - year - old was supposed to be watching were so traumatized by what went on during the party ' that they did not come out of their hiding places until two days after we had come home			1
' authorities have been given a list of the names of at least 46 people who were at the party as they begin to investigate the role the cat - sitter played in throwing the party			1
authorities say that 25 of the teens involved in destroying the house attended @entity15 , seven were from @entity232 , six from @entity299 , four from @entity233 - which charges fees of $ 10,000 a year - three from a @entity302 high school and one was an exchange student			1
elite : the majority of teens who destroyed the home went to elite private schools like @entity233 the identity of the 17 - year - old cat - sitter has not been made public			1
in addition to the video of a teenager urinating on @entity81 's bed , authorities found other social media entries they believe are in reference to the party : ' if i did n’t die last night , i ’m probably living forever			2
' ' i am disgusted by every aspect of this night			0
' ' never realized that i go to school with such horny people			0
' ' roll another bowl			0
' @entity29 says he and his wife met with the parents of the cat - sitter			1
he says they asked them to reimburse the $ 8,500 they spent on their vacation as partial restitution for the damage done to their home			0
the girls ' parents , however , gave them a check for $ 90 - the amount they 'd paid the girl to watch their cats			1
if no criminal charges are filed , @entity81 will likely sue the parents of the cat - sitter in civil court .			1

the 17 - year - old girl who was cat - sitting for @entity20 family when a wild party took place says it 's not her fault
a lawyer for the girl says the @entity29 family told her she could have friends over - and it was these friends who threw the ' drunken orgy '
the lawyer says she is a victim , not an instigator
@entity29 says the teens trashed the home , leaving feces , urine , vomit and used condoms everywhere
they also stole thousands of dollars worth of jewelry and $ 6,000 in cash
the cat - sitter 's parents wrote @entity81 a check for $ 90 - the amount he had paid their daughter
authorities say nearly 50 people were involved in destroying @entity29 's house
