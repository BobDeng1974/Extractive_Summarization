by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 published : 08:27 est , 30 october 2013 updated : 20:44 est , 30 october 2013 controversial : @entity3 , from @entity4 , claims claims ' consumption rooms ' for heroin users would help curb crime drug addicts should be given ‘ safe heroin ’ and a private place to inject it – all at taxpayers ’ expense , according to an elected police commissioner			1
@entity3 , the police and crime commissioner in charge of @entity4 , said the state should provide heroin for free and ‘ consumption rooms ’ where addicts can inject without fear of arrest or prosecution			1
it would cost the state an estimated £ 18,000 a year per user			0
the @entity28 politician , who is a former senior police officer , said : ‘ we want the health service to provide addicts with safe heroin , with consistent purities and safe additives			0
we believe this will help reduce disease and death			0
this does n’t mean we ’re going soft on drugs in any way			0
‘ what we are saying is we have a group of people here who commit large numbers of crimes to feed their habits and those illegal drugs cause massive health problems			0
’ however , critics rejected his proposal			0
@entity52 , a research fellow at the @entity53 , said it was ‘ totally irresponsible ’ , adding : ‘ should n’t we be spending that money on intensive rehab and trying to get them off drugs ? ’ mr @entity3 ’s suggestion was also shot down by the @entity60			2
a spokesman said the government had ‘ no plans to allow drug consumption rooms ’			1
earlier this year mr @entity3 ’s chief constable , @entity65 , called for the legalisation of class a drugs like heroin and cocaine as the war against them had ‘ failed ’			2
mr @entity3 said he was not suggesting drugs should be freely available , but said better regulation could help bring a halt to addiction			2
mr @entity3 , a former senior policeman , said : ' the successes of trials around the world have led both myself and chief constable @entity65 to believe that using drug consumption rooms to treat heroin addiction should be explored further - certainly county - wide			1
‘ results published in the @entity84 showed that prescribing pharmaceutical heroin in this way can reduce the use of street drugs and associated levels of crime			0
’ pilot schemes which involved decriminalising drugs have already been held in @entity93 , @entity94 and @entity95			0
councillors in @entity97 are set to consider consumption rooms - often dubbed ‘ shooting galleries ’ - in @entity94 next year			1
but @entity100 , part of the @entity102 , said consumption rooms might not be the best way to tackle illegal drug use			1
it said : ‘ these facilities would be expensive to provide and may not be the most cost effective way of achieving outcomes for service users			2
’ @entity112 solution : one of @entity114 's consumption rooms , available to the city 's 8,000 hard drug users @entity117 , campaign director of the @entity118 , slammed the scheme as a misuse of public funds			1
he said : ' many people will have very serious reservations about their money being spent in this manner			0
' police chiefs should be doing their part to tackle addiction , not spending taxpayers ’ money facilitating it			0
' ultimately taxpayers would be paying for a room for people to break the law in , something that could have very serious and unforeseen consequences			1
' @entity114 , in @entity112 , already runs a similar scheme to the one proposed by mr @entity3			1
there are 8,000 hard drug users there , who all have access to two drug consumption rooms , launched last year and this august			1
@entity144 , who manages the rooms , told the @entity146 : ' we are providing a clean environment for long - term addicts and we have found that they are now much more likely to access other health services in the area			0
' theory : mr @entity3 quoted a study that claims prescribing pharmaceutical heroin can lead to a reduction in crime			2

@entity3 , crime commissioner for @entity159 , said ' consumption rooms ' would help curb crime
@entity100 said facilities would be expensive to run
@entity118 slammed scheme : ' taxpayers would be paying for a room for people to break the law in '
