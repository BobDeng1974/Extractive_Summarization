it sounds like a dessert , is as small as a credit card , and could inspire the next @entity3			1
the creators of the £ 22 @entity6 computer , which launched yesterday , hope it will encourage children to design their own apps			2
but the first task for the next generation of @entity12 and @entity13 could be to build a new website for the product , after the current page crashed under the weight of demand			0
the tiny £ 22 @entity6 computer includes a wi - fi connection to access the internet , can connect to other gadgets such as cameras , and is even capable of running basic @entity25 games technology teach @entity27 the gadget looks rather odd next to sleek modern offerings such as the @entity30 , and appears to have more in common with the crystal radio sets of the 1950s			1
@entity32 however , the machine is a fully - fledged computer and can be connected to a monitor , keyboard and mouse , as well as speakers and printers			2
@entity40 , co-founder of the @entity42 - based @entity41 , said : ‘ the primary goal was to build a low - cost computer that every child could own , and one where programming was the natural thing to do with it			1
’ the launch follows criticism of technology teaching in the @entity51			1
typically , this has focused on how to use a computer , rather than how to create hardware or software			0
last august the chairman of @entity57 , @entity56 , said the lack of proper computer science lessons in schools was hindering @entity51 ’s chances of success in the ‘ digital media economy ’			1
his call for the @entity51 to reignite children ’s passion for science , engineering and maths was seized upon by education secretary @entity70 , who wants computer teaching to place greater emphasis on skills such as programming			1
in a recent speech , mr @entity70 said ‘ initiatives like the @entity6 scheme will give children the opportunity to learn the fundamentals of programming ’			2
he added that the gadget was ‘ a great example of the cutting edge of education technology happening right here in the @entity51 ’			1
another of the @entity6 ’s creators , @entity89 , said academics and technology experts decided to pursue the project after seeing the number of computer science students fall			0
‘ it has been six years in the making , ’ he said			0
‘ the number of things that had to go right for this to happen is enormous			0
i could n’t be more pleased			0
’ in the long term , dr @entity89 hopes the device will help create an additional 1,000 computer engineers in the @entity51 each year			1
the foundation had intended to build the device in @entity51			1
however , after finding that it would not be able to do this and keep the price at £ 22 , it opted to use factories in @entity110			0
the organisation has formed a partnership with two @entity51 distributors , @entity113 and @entity114 , which should be able to increase production quickly to meet demand			2
dr @entity89 said the popularity of the @entity6 – and the resulting pressure on its website – were positive signs			0
‘ we did n’t realise how successful this was going to be , ’ he said			0
‘ now we can concentrate on teaching people to program			0
