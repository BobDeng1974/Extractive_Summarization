by @entity0 published : 16:51 est , 21 may 2013 updated : 03:53 est , 22 may 2013 a blind anti-abortion activist forced to flee @entity2 after suffering years of torture and persecution has accused the @entity6 government of running scared from @entity7			1
@entity8 is in the @entity6 to receive an award for exposing the plight of hundreds of thousands of @entity2 women forced to undergo abortions and sterilisations as part of @entity2 's strict one - child policy			1
but his request to meet with the prime minister @entity17 and foreign secretary @entity18 during his five - day visit has been snubbed because @entity22 fears ' further punishment ' from @entity7 and will lose out on trade deals			1
snub : @entity8 ( right ) , @entity2 human rights activist pictured outside the @entity26 just before he gave his speech and @entity17 ( left ) mr @entity17 was forced to cancel a trip to @entity2 last month because the @entity30 - run @entity2 government refused him high level meetings			1
@entity7 remains incensed over @entity17 's meeting with the exiled @entity34 leader the @entity35 12 months ago , and has frozen all high level diplomatic contact since - minister @entity37 was also forced to abandon a trade trip late last month			1
@entity7 is demanding @entity22 publicly admit @entity17 's encounter with the @entity35 was a mistake			1
but @entity8 – who last year escaped from house arrest and claimed asylum at the @entity44 embassy – warned @entity17 that his kowtowing to @entity7 and placing trade above human rights was damaging @entity6 's international reputation as a nation of democratic values and freedom			1
' the @entity6 government will not meet with me because they are scared of upsetting the @entity2 government			2
but i tell @entity17 and his ministers that i am not scared of @entity7 , ' said a defiant @entity8 last night after picking up the @entity55 for his human rights work at the @entity57			1
' the @entity6 government is letting down its people by refusing to see me			2
this country has for centuries , from the slave trade to @entity63 , faced - up to dictators , fascism and oppression			0
this is not what the @entity6 people vote for , ' mr @entity8 told @entity70			1
a petitioner trying to attract public attention is taken away by policemen outside a hospital where blind activist @entity8 was kept in @entity7 last year the @entity6 people have long supported the hundreds of thousands of @entity2 women who are forced to abort their babies or undergo sterilisation every day , he said			1
' but now their government is turning his back on the issue because he thinks trade is more important , ' @entity8 added			2
visibly upset , @entity8 retold the plight of one woman forced into detention for breaching the one - child policy by becoming pregnant for a second time			2
she was taken to prison and forced to leave her three year old daughter at home			0
' the officials refused to let her organise proper child care or even make a call to relatives			0
the girl was found dead three weeks later , ' he said			0
@entity8 was given his award by @entity101 mp @entity100 , who was embarrassed on learning about the snubs for her guest by her bosses			2
@entity8 is on a brief visit to the @entity6 , to talk about his life as a political activist ' cabinet ministers have very busy diaries			1
i know that some senior @entity114 officials have agreed to meet with mr @entity8 during his trip , ' she said			2
@entity116 of @entity117 , who attended the award ceremony , also called on @entity6 and other @entity120 governments to exert pressure on @entity2 about its human rights towards women			1
' make no mistake , this is war			0
@entity2 's one policy caused more violence against women girls than any other policy on earth – than any official policy in the history of the world , ' he said			0
the @entity2 government claims 13 million abortions are carried out each year in @entity2 – that amounts to 1,458 every hour in what many describe as a state - sanctioned gendercide			0
but activists like @entity8 claim the true number is much greater and many women are forced into abortions at eight months or later			2
many of those who resist are forced into brutal 're - education through labour ' camps			0
' i call on the @entity6 people to lobby their government to take up this issue with @entity7 and remain true to the values that make @entity6 a respected country throughout the world			1
improving human rights in @entity2 will help global trade and economic recovery , not the opposite , ' he said			1
@entity8 evaded walls , security cameras and guards who kept him under house arrest for one and half years in his small rural village in eastern @entity2 a year ago			0
helped by a network of supporters and following a car chase , he found refuge for six days in the @entity170 in @entity7			0
faced with an embarrassing international stand - off , @entity2 and @entity44 officials agreed to let him and his wife leave @entity2 to go into exile in the @entity44			0
his relatives who remain in @entity2 are regularly persecuted by officials , @entity8 said			0
the @entity114 denied mr @entity8 had been snubbed by @entity22			2
a spokeswoman said : ' the @entity6 's relationship with @entity2 is broader and deeper than ever			0
inevitably there are some issues on which we disagree			0
' so long as both sides handle our differences in a balanced and reasonable way there is no reason why our bilateral relationship should not develop further and faster			0

@entity8 is in @entity6 to receive award for exposing ' gendercide '
but request to meet with the prime minister has been snubbed
