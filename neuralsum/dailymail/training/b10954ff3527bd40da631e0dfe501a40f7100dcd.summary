' he asked mr @entity2 if he had got his membership card with him , but the @entity18 leader admitted he had not			1
mr @entity34 read out the wording from the card which states that the @entity18 exist to build and safeguard a fair , free and open society , in which we seek to balance the fundamental values of liberty , equality and community , and in which no - one shall be enslaved by poverty , ignorance or conformity			1
’ he said the party ’s stated mission could not be reconciled ‘ with this government ’s attacks on the most vulnerable people in society ’			0
mr @entity2 insisted the party had delivered on promises to raise the income tax threshold and introduce a pupil premium for poorer children			2
' i am immensely proud that , facing the biggest crisis this country has seen in a generation , the @entity18 took a big , collective and brave decision - at some political cost - to say we are going to step up to the plate ... and fix this mess while also trying to make society fairer			1
' later mr @entity34 told @entity1 he had not been able to tackle mr @entity2 over claims he made about the cuts being fair			1
‘ he did n’t cover all the things that the coalition is doing to damage people on benefits			0

‘ there are lots of different places there money could come from			0
i spend more on wine than @entity129 in a week			0

’ later @entity141 frontbencher @entity140 described listening to the show as ' half an hour of my life i will never get back '			0
the shadow commons leader accused mr @entity2 of refusing to take part in a show in his constituency , claiming he was ' hiding from the people of @entity150 '			2
she told @entity151 : ' strangely , while the deputy prime minister is keen to do a @entity154 phone - in , yesterday he refused to appear on a @entity156 show to answer questions about the impact of @entity160 cuts on his own constituency			1
' mr @entity2 was also tackled over increases in tuition fees , defence cuts and which top @entity165 who would like to have a drink with @entity10 97.3 presenter @entity16 said mr @entity2 was making ' radio history ' as the first senior cabinet minister to host a regular radio phone - in in the final question the mr @entity2 disclosed that he owned a ' big green ' onesie - but he had never worn it			1
' i was given a big green onesie which i have kept in its packaging			1
i have got one but i have n't worn it yet			0
it will be something i do in the privacy of my own home , ' he added			0
the prime minister 's spokesman declined to say whether @entity61 owned a onesie			0
' i know there was a men 's @entity187 event this week but i 'm not not going to get into the habit of discussing those kinds of things , ' he told reporters			0
asked whether mr @entity61 listened to his deputy on the radio , the spokesman said : ' he was scheduled to be in meetings at that point			2
' @entity18 strategists hope the weekly show will help turn around the party 's dire poll ratings mr @entity2 was also asked if pledging to cut tuition fees was ' the biggest regret of his political life '			1
but he would only concede it is ' certainly ' a big regret			0
another caller , a @entity208 student called @entity209 , dismissed measures like the pupil premium as ' tokenistic ' and accused the government of discouraging young people from gaining qualifications by abolishing the educational maintenance allowance and increasing tuition fees			0
' it seems as if the coalition is trying to tell them that higher education is not for them , ' said @entity209 - a charge mr @entity2 did not accept			1
the deputy prime minister repeated his apology for committing the @entity18 not to raise tuition fees when they were not in a position to deliver on the promise			2
and he admitted that coming eighth in the @entity227 by - election was ' woeful '			0
mr @entity2 admitted that his party 's result in the @entity227 by - election , coming eighth , was ' woeful ' but insisted the @entity18 were right to join the coailtion but he said it was always going to be ' monumentally controversial ' for them to enter coalition with any other party , and said voters were willing to give their support when they had a chance to explain their actions			1
' where we can get on to people 's doorstep or in front of a radio mike and explain to people what we are doing , why we are sticking to our guns on some of the big decisions , why the country has to go through this difficult process , i 'm finding that people - perhaps not with bunting and wild - eyed enthusiasm - recognise that what we are doing is the right thing , ' he said			2
' what i 'm trying to do is build a strong economy and a fair society			0
' in a wide - ranging 30 - minute slot , mr @entity2 also revealed @entity263 to be the top @entity165 he would most like to go for a drink with			1
his first phone - in comes in the week of the government 's @entity266 , which was seen as an attempt to relaunch the coalition at the halfway point in its planned five - year term			2
he emerged largely unscathed from the first encounter but party strategists will be worried if every week is dominated by angry former @entity18			2
