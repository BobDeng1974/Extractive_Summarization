the distinct green glow of @entity1 has been closely watched as it came into view in the night 's sky over the past month			1
one amateur astronomer has now compiled a series of 100 images he took of the comet , also called @entity9 / 2014 @entity8 , as it passed over @entity10 , @entity11 , in the @entity12			1
using just a standard slr camera and tripod , @entity13 was able to create a time - lapse video of the tiny green dot as it moved across the night 's sky			1
another amateur astronomer , @entity19 took another eeiry image that highlighted the trail of dust streaming off behind the comet as it passes through the solar system			1
he took the picture , using a series of filters to highlight the and bright green head , from the @entity35 in @entity36 near @entity37 , @entity21			0
@entity1 is around 43 million miles from @entity38 and was thought to be travelling at around 15 miles a second			1
it was first spotted by @entity21 @entity39 , who has a prolific record among amateur astronomers , and he named the comet			1
to date , mr @entity39 , from @entity43 , has discovered five comets , all using relatively simple equipment compared to what 's found at a professional observatory			0
it was first spotted on august 17 and in recent weeks has been dramatically captured on camera by amateur astronomers around the world			1
the comet 's distinctive green glow comes from molecules of diatomic carbon - two carbon atoms joined together - and cyanogen fluorescing in the ultraviolet light from the sun. its tail takes on a more blue tinge due to the carbon monoxide it contains			1
this graph shows estimates of @entity1 's trajectory as it passed closest to the @entity38 on january 7 @entity69 @entity68 , from @entity70 , took this striking photograph of @entity1 on 11 january the comet is expected to remain visible for much of january and it will climb steadily higher in the night 's sky @entity39 started off at magnitude 15 brightness and has since reached magnitude 5 , the brightness necessary to be seen without the aid of a telescope			1
a comet 's brightness is measured by magnitude and on the astronomical magnitude scale , lower numbers indicate more intense brightness			1
scientists are now attempting to calculate the @entity1 's path round the solar system and believe that on its next encounter with the @entity38 it may come even closer			1
however , it is not expected to pass within the @entity38 's orbit around the @entity92 comets are essentially piles of rock , gravel , and dust held together by various kinds of ice - essentially water and carbon dioxide ice			2
as the comet nears the sun , its icy tail turns into a gas and blows away - due to pressure from the solar wind and sunlight			2
they also release dust and gravel which tend to follow the comet around the sun - and if the @entity38 's orbit intersects this material it results in annual meteor showers			2
eerie diamond in the sky : @entity1 's striking green glow ( pictured above , earlier this month ) is caused by light being given off by flourescing carbon molecules at its peak levels of brightness , @entity1 could be spotted with the naked eye on dark nights first spotted on august 17 , @entity1 was captured on camera above @entity126 in @entity127 ( above ) @entity1 should hit magnitude 4.1 in mid-january , which would mean that sightseers could spot traces of the comet ' from light - polluted city suburbs '			1
some observers were able to spot @entity39 in late december as it reached magnitude 5.3			0
@entity1 is due to remain visible for much of january			0
astronomer @entity136 from @entity137 explains how to spot the comet in the night sky : ' @entity1 ( @entity140 ) is growing in brightness and will hit a magnitude of +4.1 in the first two weeks of the new year			2
' a magnitude of +4.1 is just over 100 times dimmer than the brightest star in @entity38 's entire night time sky ( @entity146 )			2
the more positive the number , the lower the magnitude and the dimmer an object is			0
' the comet is currently at a magnitude of around +5.0 , meaning that it is an ideal target for those who have received a telescope or pair of binoculars for @entity156			0
' the comet is much more favourable for @entity159 observers			0
it was a @entity161 target , but it 's leaving their skies now			0
to observe it , late evening is best , around 10.30pm gmt. ' it 's climbing higher and higher in the sky as the nights go on , so by 5 january , you should be able to see it as soon as it gets dark			0
' ' even in a pair of 10x50 binoculars and under moderate suburban light pollution , comet @entity39 appears as a faint , white smudge			0
if conditions are much more favourable however , you should be able to make out a bit of shape to the comet , particularly at the centre - albeit only just ! ' again , the darker the skies and the better your optical aid , the more you will see			0
you may even be able to pick out the stunning greenish tint of the comet , but astrophotography will make this much more apparent			0
' @entity1 is close to the southern section of the constellation @entity188 ( @entity190 ) and will begin to make its way through the constellation of @entity193 as we head into the new year			0
' stargazers hoping to see the comet can use this graph to locate the comet 's position in they sky			2

amateur astronomer @entity13 took 100 images of @entity1
his video *crunches* two hours of observations into just nine seconds
astronomer @entity19 also captured a stunning image of the comet 's tail
the comet was first spotted in august by an astronomer in @entity21
it leaves a magnificent green trail as its ice and gas glows in the sunlight
the comet passed 43 million miles from the @entity38 at its closest point
