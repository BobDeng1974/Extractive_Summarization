by @entity1 reporter published : 15:33 est , 23 september 2012 updated : 15:33 est , 23 september 2012 @entity4 governor @entity3 's embarrassing inability to remember a government department he would eliminate if he became president , perhaps the biggest gaffe of the 2012 election campaign , was due to chronic lack of sleep , a new book has revealed			1
' oops ' - a diary of covering the @entity3 campaign by @entity15 correspondent @entity14 - says @entity3 suffered from insomnia for weeks before the gaffe			1
the blunder occurred during a @entity20 presidential debate in @entity21 , @entity22 on november 9 last year			1

@entity14 , who covered the @entity3 presidential campaign from the summer of 2011 to its end in early 2012 , said @entity3 had battled insomnia most of the campaign			2
@entity3 stumbled in several debates and at one debate in @entity44 , @entity45 , one of his answers was almost incoherent			1

sleep apnea causes the sufferer to have one or more pauses in breathing while asleep			2
these can last from a few seconds to minutes			1

obstructive sleep apnea , where the airway collapses , is the most common			0
anyone can be affected by this condition although it is more common in overweight people			0
' after conducting overnight tests on @entity3 , they produced a rather startling diagnosis : he had sleep apnea , and it had gone undetected for years , probably decades , ' @entity14 said			0
@entity3 's unraveling began in earnest after back surgery in mid-june , 2011			0
the @entity4 governor took pain killers for a few weeks after the surgery but refused to continue them because he said he wanted to be mentally sharp for the campaign			1
by october , @entity3 was diagnosed with sleep apnea , a chronic condition in which a patient sleeps so lightly that he is constantly waking and breathing can stop for a moment			0
@entity3 was given a machine that helps breathing become more regular during sleep			0

this kept him from sleeping , @entity14 says			0
