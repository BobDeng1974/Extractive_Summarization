a dossier detailing explosive claims of sex abuse by paedophiles within @entity4 has gone missing			2
given to home secretary @entity6 in 1983 , the files allegedly exposed a vile network at @entity8 and @entity9			1
but there is no record of any subsequent criminal inquiry and the @entity13 yesterday admitted the dossier is either lost or destroyed			0
given to home secretary @entity6 in 1983 , the files allegedly exposed a vile network at @entity8 and @entity9 @entity6 , 74 , is now facing questions over his handling of the document and inconsistencies in his account of what he did with it			1
the @entity27 peer told journalists last year he had no recollection of being given the dossier			1
but in a statement yesterday morning , he changed his mind			1
he confirmed he was handed a ‘ substantial bundle of papers ’ by mp @entity33 in november 1983 and passed them to his officials for further investigation			1
he said : ‘ i do not recall being contacted further about these matters by @entity13 officials or by mr @entity33 or by anyone else			1
’ hours later @entity6 amended his account again after proof emerged that he had written to mr @entity33 in march 1984 informing him the dossier had been assessed by prosecutors and handed to police			1
@entity13 officials say they have searched for the dossier but can not find it			0
last night @entity49 mp @entity48 , who has challenged @entity6 to explain how he dealt with the allegations , demanded to know what police had done with the information provided by the late mr @entity33			1
the @entity27 peer told journalists last year he had no recollection of being given the dossier			1
but in a statement yesterday morning , he changed his mind			1
he confirmed he was handed a ' substantial bundle of papers ' by mp @entity33 ( pictured ) in november 1983 and passed them to his officials for further investigation he said : ‘ why would you destroy such an important document ? what action was taken ? were any prosecutions forthcoming ? we need to know this			1
it ’s raising more questions than it is answers			0
many people will think it has been destroyed to protect the people whose names were in it			0
’ in his second statement yesterday , @entity6 said he had acted properly and the dossier had been fully followed up			1
mr @entity48 said : ‘ to hear a former home secretary dismiss evidence from @entity33 , a member of his own party who has a strong track record in campaigning on this issue , in such a casual , procedural manner is extremely worrying			1
‘ the impression conveyed is that sir @entity6 does not want to talk about this			2
it goes right to the heart of an attitude in politics that child abuse is a subject best avoided			0
he should reveal what he knew at the time about paedophile networks and what action he took			0
’ the @entity93 mp – who helped expose the full extent of @entity97 mp sir @entity96 ’s paedophile attacks in a book earlier this year , serialised by the @entity99 – is calling for a @entity101 - style inquiry into child abuse allegations against politicians			2
@entity49 mp @entity48 , who has challenged @entity6 to explain how he dealt with the allegations , demanded to know what police had done with the information provided by the late mr @entity33 a lawyer representing alleged victims of abuse at the south - west @entity111 reportedly named in the dossier , criticised the loss of the document			1
@entity115 , head of the abuse team at @entity117 , said : ‘ my clients are incredulous at how this dossier can have simply disappeared			0
it seems inconceivable that a document of such importance can have simply disappeared			0
‘ i would strongly support the calls for a widespread inquiry into historic sexual abuse so that my clients could have their many questions answered about who knew what and that a very troubling veil is lifted from the corridors of power			2
’ the prime minister ’s official spokesman declined to back mr @entity48 ’s demands for an over-arching inquiry – a call which has garnered the support of 120 mps			0
the @entity93 mp - who helped expose the full extent of @entity97 mp sir @entity96 's ( pictured ) paedophile attacks in a book earlier this year , serialised by the @entity99 - is calling for a @entity101 -- style inquiry into child abuse allegations against politicians he said independent inquiries were already under way into allegations relating to the @entity147 and the @entity148			2
but when asked whether there should be an independent inquiry into allegations of @entity4 paedophile rings , he referred to last year ’s @entity13 review			0
asked to comment on the @entity33 dossier , @entity154 said last night : ‘ the @entity156 is currently assessing information and conducting a number of investigations under @entity160			2
any material submitted to us , historic or current , is reviewed to establish if it is relevant to these			0
’ @entity164 , former children ’s minister , told @entity165 : ‘ in order to restore confidence in our child protection system , because things have got a lot better , we need an overarching inquiry that puts all this into context and makes recommendations so we can make sure we have a child protection service that is fit for purpose			2
‘ the victims must come first			0
and those many victims , many hundreds if not thousands who have been suffering often in silence going back to the 60s , 70s , 80s who have been emboldened to come forward			0
at last we are listening to them and their stories are being taken seriously but we need to find out why they were n’t taken seriously when these offences happened			0
