@entity13 's sister , @entity38 , found them			2
@entity8 had claimed that the night his wife was murdered he was 160 miles from home staying at a hotel in @entity43 , @entity44 , while on a business trip			1
the jury in @entity47 , @entity20 deliberated for only six hours today before returning a guilty verdict at 3.48pm			2

according to @entity53 , during final deliberations this morning , the jury requested a list of items entered into evidence to examine , including clothes worn by the family , crime scene photos and @entity8 's luggage from his business trip			1
the salesman was jailed in 2009 , but released on bond of $ 900,000 in july last year , after a jury failed to reach a verdict in his first trial			2

@entity8 was barred from receiving any life insurance payout or assets as a result of his wife 's death			1
prosecutors described the attack , in which they say @entity13 was hit at least thirty times on the head with blunt force , as ' brutal and personal '			2
during the retrial , chief assistant district attorney @entity94 said @entity8 was inconsistent when he recounted the night of his wife 's death			1
the jury also heard dramatic testimony from @entity74 's sister @entity99 who revealed that the couple 's toddler spoke of her father during the 911 call			2
prosecutors pointed out that in the tape of the call , @entity31 could be heard in the background			2
during the call , @entity109 asked the toddler what happened to her mother and if anyone had been in the house			2
on the original call , ms @entity109 can be heard telling the dispatcher she did n't think the child understood what was happening			2

two women took the stand to say they 'd had extra-marital sex with @entity8 in the months leading up to his wife 's murder			1
in his original trial @entity8 made the unusual move of testifying in his own defence			1
speaking though tears , he said that , although he was not a exemplary husband , he loved his wife and had no hand in her death			2

mother and child : @entity74 's two - year - old daughter @entity31 , now 7 , was found hiding in a bed near the crime scene @entity8 allegedly left the hotel through an emergency exit , wedging the door open so as to avoid using his key card to get back inside , prosecutors say			1
' the defendant had a plan			0
his plan was to murder his wife , and his plan was to get away with it , ' @entity162 told jurors in the first trial			2
this time around , the prosecution ’s opening statement portrayed @entity8 as an juvenile man who did n't want another baby , @entity131 reported			1
but the defence ’s opening statement argued that the state ’s case was mainly circumstantial , and without direct evidence linking @entity8 to the crime scene			1
attorney @entity178 conceded that the @entity179 were having problems in their marriage , but argued that did not make @entity8 a killer			1
gruesome scene : a photo of @entity187 's footprints in her mother 's blood was shown to the court during the retrial @entity178 said			0
' i am not here to tell you that he was a good husband			0
he was far from it			0
he 's acted like an obnoxious , juvenile jerk			0
but what you 've got to remember ladies and gentlemen , is that we do n't convict people of murder , just because they act like jerks			0
' @entity109 discovered her sister 's lifeless body after getting a voicemail from @entity8 asking her to go to the house to look for some papers about an anniversary present for @entity74			1
