by @entity0 a baby girl has been born with paralysed vocal cords - leaving her unable to gurgle or even cry			1
three - month - old @entity3 may one day regain her voice but currently , her mother @entity5 , 23 , can only tell she is distressed by looking out for tears or a sad face			1
the baby girl was born with bilateral vocal cord paralysis - meaning that both sides of her vocal cords are unable to move			1
specialists at @entity13 in @entity14 gave @entity3 a tracheotomy - an opening made in the neck to provide her with an airway she was able to make sounds and gurgle in her first few days but @entity5 and @entity3 's father , @entity19 , also 23 , soon noticed problems with her breathing			1
doctors told them it was nothing to worry about but the couple from @entity27 , @entity28 , rushed her to @entity29 when she became so short of oxygen she started turning blue			2
specialists at @entity14 ’s @entity13 diagnosed the little girl with bilateral vocal cord paralysis after examining her throat with a tiny camera			1
they had no choice but to give @entity3 a tracheotomy - an opening made in the neck to provide her with an airway			2
the 90 - minute operation was a success but , by a cruel irony , the air she breathes now bypasses her vocal cords meaning the she can not make a sound			1
and because babies ca n’t produce tears for their first month or so , @entity5 and @entity19 could only rely on facial expressions to tell if she was crying			2
full - time mother @entity5 said : ' from birth we had problems - she would go blue and would stop breathing			1
' we had to breathe in her face or squeeze her foot to make her cry and breathe again			2
' having the tracheotomy was our only option			0
her episodes were becoming so severe it was the safest thing for her			0
' she was able to cry and make noises before but the tracheotomy has been installed below her voice box which means air no longer rushes past her vocal cords when she tries to make a noise			1
' there are a few tears now but we ’ve mainly only been able to tell if she was crying by looking at her facial expressions - it ’s heart wrenching			2
@entity70 s long term prognosis is unclear and her parents do n't know how long she ¿ ll need her tracheotomy ' we can also tell if she ’s giggling but she makes no noise			0
she moves her mouth as if she ’s going to make a sound - that ’s really hard for us both to deal with			0
' @entity5 , who married self - employed electrician @entity19 last year , says @entity3 ’s long term prognosis is unclear and does n’t know how long she ’ll need her tracheotomy			1
they are currently staying with their daughter in hospital while they learn to maintain the device , which will need changing once a week			0
@entity5 added : ' the future for us at the moment is uncertain			0
' we need to wait until her voice cords become stronger and start moving			0
it make take one year , five year or 15 years - we just do n’t know			0
@entity3 's parents @entity5 and @entity89 are learning sign language so they can communicate fully with their daughter in years to come ' hopefully she will grow out of it and will eventually able to speak , but there ’s no guarantee			1
her voice box might not recover from it			0
' she will eventually learn that if she puts her finger over the hole she will make some noise , but that wo n’t be for some time			0
' the family are learning sign language so they can communicate fully with @entity3 in years to come			0
@entity5 is also writing an online blog to raise awareness of the condition , which is usually caused by damage to the recurrent laryngeal nerve , which controls the movement of the vocal cords			1
it can be damaged during childbirth , during spinal surgery or caused by infection or neurological problems			0
in some cases no cause can be identified			0
children with one - sided vocal cord paralysis can be treated with voice therapy , which is likened to physiotherapy for the voice box , or an operation to reshape the vocal cords			1
two - sided vocal cord paralysis , however , is more serious and often requires immediate treatment			1
@entity5 said : ' for now it ’s just a matter of supporting her as best we can - she has been so strong throughout this			2
' we will be doing everything we possibly can to help her and give her a happy and normal life			0

three - month - old @entity3 from @entity28 can not cry or even gurgle
bilateral vocal cord paralysis means neither side of her vocal cords move
her mother @entity5 , 23 , relies seeing tears or a sad face to know she 's upset
