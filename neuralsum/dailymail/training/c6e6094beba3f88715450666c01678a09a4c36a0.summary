people living in @entity1 can no longer enjoy a brown bag lunch after city bureaucrats banned the term from official use for being racist			1
a memo sent out from the @entity7 also banned the word ' citizen ' , claiming it could lead to people feeling excluded in the multi-cultural city			2
the memo went on to offer politically correct alternatives that could be used in official documents and discussions			0
politically correct : @entity1 now has residents instead of citizens and sack lunches instead of brown bags ' luckily , we 've got options , ' @entity19 wrote in the internal memo , according to @entity23			1
' for " citizens " , how about " residents " ? ' mr @entity19 defended the ban on a @entity1 radio station , and said that the term ' brown bag ' had historically been used as a way to determine skin color			1
memo : @entity19 , of the @entity7 , has suggested alternatives to the terms paper bags had once been used as way to decide if african - americans had what was considered to be a light enough skin tone to be admitted to certain college teams and houses			1
' for a lot of particularly @entity46 community members , the phrase brown bag does bring up associations with the past when a brown bag was actually used , i understand , to determine if people 's skin color was light enough to allow admission to an event , ' mr @entity19 said			1
the practice was described in @entity56 by @entity57 , who says he experienced the brown paper bag test when he started at @entity59 in the 1960s , according to the @entity61			2
the chairman of @entity64 's @entity63 , said : ' some of the brothers who came from @entity66 held a " bag party "			0

' they are legal residents of the @entity117 and they are residents of @entity1			2
they pay taxes and if we use a term like citizens in common use , then it does n't include a lot of folks , ' mr @entity19 said			0
according to @entity129 , 94,952 - or 16 per cent - of the city 's inhabitants are foreign , with most coming originally from @entity130			0
