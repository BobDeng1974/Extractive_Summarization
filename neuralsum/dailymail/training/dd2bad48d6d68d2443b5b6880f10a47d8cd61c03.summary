by @entity0 published : 08:45 est , 1 february 2013 updated : 09:30 est , 1 february 2013 he has become a household name thanks to his sporting talents and down - to - earth personality			2
and now , fresh from his boxing ring success , it seems there is no stopping @entity9 as he unveils a second collection for menswear label @entity8			1
the 35 - year - old former @entity13 cricketer is , unsurprisingly , extremely pleased with how it has turned out - because he wears every single item himself			2
' while my stuff is n't depicting high fashion , it 's the sort of stuff i 'd wear			2
i wear things that i feel comfortable in to be honest , i do n't follow what 's in fashion or the latest trends i just like to go out feeling comfortable and my line reflects this , ' he told @entity28			1
career change : @entity9 has left his cricket bat behind and tried his hand at clothes designing , here he presents his second collection for @entity8 the 6ft 4in former @entity35 player embodies the @entity38 - based brand 's ethos , which aims to cater to men of all shapes and sizes and is well known for its simply be and @entity43 plus - size brands			1
when the label announced their collaboration with @entity9 , @entity46 , chief executive of @entity47 , said : ' with his broad athletic build , [ @entity9 ] will no doubt provide a strong point of identity for our customer base			0
' high and mighty : the range of casual clothes and suits has been designed for men of all shapes and sizes and with his tall stature , @entity9 is the perfection depiction of that @entity9 is the perfect advocate for the brand and each item of the @entity9 by @entity8 spring / summer range is available in medium to @entity64 and in a range of lengths to suit men of varying sizes			1
looking casual and cool , the burly blond tried his dab hand at modelling his latest offering in an @entity73 studio shoot			0
speaking about the photographs , he said : ' it 's weird looking at yourself			2
i do n't think i will ever become a model			0
i once did a catwalk for a charity fashion show , it was n't fun			0
' walking down there and back , i know it sounds so easy but i 've never been so self conscious in my life			0
' i did n't particularly get good feedback			0
' comfortable : @entity9 says he does n't follow high fashion but has designed a line that is stylish yet mainly focuses on comfort so while he wo n't be following in fellow athlete @entity90 's modelling footsteps anytime soon , he does admire the footballer 's style			1
' i am happy how i am and there is no one i want to look like but @entity90 dresses well , he really is quite sharp			1
' he also rates his league of their own co-star @entity97 's suited and booted fashion choices			1
' out of the @entity101 boys , i 've got to say @entity97 is the best dressed or he would be gutted , he loves his clothes			2
model behaviour : @entity9 looked like a professional modelling his clothes in an @entity73 studio but says he would never consider a career in it ' i think @entity108 has got the student look down to a @entity110 , he looks like he needs a good wash			1
' having said that , i saw him on the tv the other night at an awards show and i have never seen him so smart , he combed his hair and everything			0
' as for @entity116 , he tries his best on the show and he likes his cardigans and ties but @entity97 leads the way			0
' the day job : @entity9 and his co-stars are currently filming more @entity124 and he rates @entity97 's style following his professional boxing debut in november where he beat @entity128 @entity127 , @entity9 is taking some time out and has moved back up north with his family			1
' i am currently taking stock after my boxing			0
we have moved back up north and are getting the kids settled into school , which i am really enjoying			0
' the new @entity136 by @entity8 collection will be available online at @entity139 from the 26th february and the current collection is available to view today .			1
