by @entity0 for the @entity1 drunks who abuse staff in @entity6 departments should be fined £ 50 , health minister @entity2 has said drunks who abuse staff in @entity6 departments should be fined £ 50 , health minister @entity2 has said			1
those who ‘ gratuitously ’ consume too much alcohol , especially at the weekends , are putting a ‘ huge ’ burden on hospitals according to the senior @entity13			1
he wants on - the - spot fines for them , starting with those who are ‘ abusive ’ to medical staff , and can make @entity6 feel like a ‘ war zone ’			1
mr @entity2 said : ‘ there ’s an issue with youngsters drinking too much			1
it ’s having a massive impact on people ’s health and the consequences for them further down the line are enormous			0
‘ the health service is under a lot of pressure and we all have a responsibility to the @entity32 to make sure it is sustainable and we do n’t abuse the fact that it ’s a freely available service – a principle i strongly endorse			1
‘ but it can be like a war zone there late on friday night			2
if someone is drunk and abusive they have to feel there are some consequences to that			2
’ mr @entity2 is putting the policy forward for the @entity13 ’ election manifesto			1
if his colleagues back it , it could be implemented if the party end up in a second coalition next year			0
he suggested a fine of £ 50 per incident , adding that with the right safeguards he did not believe the measure would lead to a ‘ slippery slope ’ of charges for other patients seen to have behaved irresponsibly			1
@entity32 staff would have to use the power sparingly – and not fine people who are alcoholics seeking treatment , or people with mental health problems who may appear abusive			1
but doctors said the proposal was unworkable , and that many people who turn up at emergency departments drunk are also injured , or have other health conditions			0
mr @entity2 said : ‘ it ’s important for a @entity71 party to make clear that with freedom comes responsibility			1
‘ this is not about alcoholics , or people with mental health problems , ’ he said			1
‘ it ’s very important that they are referred automatically for the right treatment			2
‘ @entity80 would have to exercise discretion , and there would of course be a right of appeal if it was wrongly used in this way			2
‘ it ’s about getting faster referrals for people with alcoholism or mental health problems , while tackling those who gratuitously drink far too much			2
’ those who ' gratuitously ' consume too much alcohol , especially at the weekends , are putting a ' huge ' burden on hospitals according to the senior @entity13 alcohol - related hospital admissions have risen sharply over the past decade in the @entity98			1
there are now one million per year – and alcohol costs the taxpayer £ 3.5billion every year			0
there were nearly 60,000 physical assaults on @entity32 staff in 2011/12			2
@entity105 , chief executive of the @entity106 said : ‘ it would be very tricky , and i have n’t seen a proposal that would be workable			0
what if someone is injured as well as being inebriated ? ‘ for example they had a couple of glasses of wine , fell and really hurt themselves ? the priority is treating them			0
‘ it ’s all very well saying these people are a huge burden on hospitals which they are , and @entity6 staff do face challenging situations			1
but there are many other ways we need to tackle alcohol abuse before it gets to hospital			0
‘ it ’s also very difficult to isolate who would be liable , as people with depression or mental health problems can drink to alleviate the symptoms			0
and practically , would you have to take the money first , from a drunk person , or take a credit card ? or if it ’s a case of collecting it afterwards , then for £ 50 , the effort needed to chase it up might become uneconomic			0
’ charges for @entity6 apply elsewhere			0
in @entity145 , patients must pay 100 euros ( £ 80 ) if they do not have a referral letter from a gp , with limited exemptions			0
@entity145 ’s health minister @entity149 has also backed charging drink and drug abusers at @entity6			0
