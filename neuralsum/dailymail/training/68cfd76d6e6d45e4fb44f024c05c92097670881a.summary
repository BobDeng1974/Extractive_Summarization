in the @entity2 films , @entity0 has mutant powers which mean he can heal himself - even when he ’s shot , or thrown from a building			2
and now researchers in the @entity7 are working on an implant that would make these superhuman powers a reality			0
the @entity13 - pronounced ' electrics ' - concept involves implanting tiny devices into patients ’ bodies that use electric impulses to monitor and fix vital organs			1
the @entity13 - pronounced electrics - project ( illustrated ) involves implanting tiny devices into patients ’ bodies that use electric impulses to monitor and fix vital organs			1
each implant would be so small , it could be injected into patients using a needle to target nerve endings the program is being sponsored by the @entity28 ( @entity28 )			1

as it is sits inside the body , the implant would use electric impulses to monitor the health of the body ’s organs			1
if it spots an organ is infected , injured or failing , it would stimulate the nerves needed to get the affected organ back to functioning effectively			2
the idea behind the implant is based on the body ’s natural monitoring system known as neuromodulation			1
as it is sits inside the body , the implant would use electric impulses to monitor the health of the body ’s organs			1
if it spots that an organ is infected , injured or failing , it would stimulate the nerves needed to get the affected organ functioning effectively again			2
the idea behind the implant is based on the body ’s natural monitoring system known as neuromodulation			1
in the body ’s peripheral nervous system , neuromodulation monitors the status of organs and manages how they respond to disease			2
but , when a person is sick or injured , this process can be weakened and does n’t work as well as it should			0
in some cases , it can cause people to become more ill as the body fails to fight the infection			0
the implant being proposed by @entity28 would give this natural process a boost , and prevent it from going wrong			2
current medical neuromodulation devices are large and difficult to implant , but @entity28 's implant would be small enough to target precise nerve endings			1
in the @entity2 franchise , @entity0 ( played by @entity84 pictured ) has mutant powers that means he can heal himself - even after being shot , or thrown from a building			0
@entity28 's implant would work in a similar way to give the body ’s natural monitoring and healing system , known as neuromodulation , a boost ‘ the technology @entity28 plans to develop through the @entity13 program could fundamentally change the manner in which doctors diagnose , monitor and treat injury and illness ’ said @entity94 , @entity28 program manager			1
‘ instead of relying only on medication - we envision a closed - loop system that would work in concept like a tiny , intelligent pacemaker			0
it would continually assess conditions and provide stimulus patterns tailored to help maintain healthy organ function , helping patients get healthy and stay healthy using their body ’s own systems			0
’ @entity28 claims the device would be used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease , epilepsy , traumatic brain injury and even depression , for example			0
the agency said it will release full technical details on @entity13 ‘ in the coming months ’ .			0

the @entity13 *–* pronounced electrics - project is sponsored the @entity28 ( @entity28 )
tiny implants would use electric impulses to monitor a person ’s body
if organs are infected , the implant would stimulate nerves needed to heal it
idea is based on our natural monitoring system called neuromodulation
current medical neuromodulation devices are large and difficult to implant
@entity28 's implant would be so small it could target nerve endings
