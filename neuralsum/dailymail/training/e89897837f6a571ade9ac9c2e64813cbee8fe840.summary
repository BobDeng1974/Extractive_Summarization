@entity0 will play the ' home ' leg of their @entity4 last 16 tie with @entity5 on tuesday night			1
except it is n't at home , nor is it even close to home for the @entity11 champions			2
the match will be played at the @entity13 , a colossal 750 miles ( 1,200km ) from their abandoned @entity14 , the glistening monument to the team 's success now caught up in a warzone			1
smashed windows at @entity0 's @entity14 following an artillery attack by @entity23 separatists last october			1
the team are to play @entity5 on tuesday 750 miles away in @entity13 @entity0 players train at the @entity13 , their temporary home , ahead of the @entity4 last 16 tie @entity0 's star player , @entity28 in action - he is the top scorer in the @entity4 with nine goals seem fanciful ? not if you saw the chilling footage of the @entity14 , which less than three years ago witnessed scenes of such joy and celebration at @entity36 , being shelled by rebel forces back in october			1
security cameras pick up the sound of artillery fire crashing into the exterior of the stadium , then a large panel of glass coming crashing down just inches away from a small child walking past			0
the game of football caught up in the cross-fire of conflict			0
there was simply no way @entity0 could stay at home - imagine if that shell had struck while a match was taking place			2
and , despite the cease - fire between @entity11 and @entity59 brokered last week by @entity61 chancellor @entity60 , there seems little realistic hope of @entity0 's nomadic existence ending soon			1
they recently extended their tenancy at @entity13 until the end of the year , knowing it is sufficiently out of the way in the west of the country for @entity71 to allow them to play their matches on @entity11 soil			1
the @entity13 - capacity 34,915 - where @entity0 's match with @entity5 will take place the magnificent @entity14 - the club 's home - before it was abandoned because of the conflict not that @entity5 are taking any chances this week - they did not travel to @entity13 ( a flight of just 560 miles from @entity80 ) until monday afternoon and will return straight after the game			1
' it 's hard to grasp and it 's a unique experience to be playing against a team that is based in a crisis area , ' said @entity61 striker @entity86			0
' somehow , it 's a surreal situation			0
you know there is this terrible war out there , but you do n't really realise it because you do n't really know such a situation personally			0
' the 34,900 - capacity @entity13 , home of @entity96 , is expected to be sold - out but mainly with local who have come to gain a glimpse of the outstanding football played by @entity101 's @entity61 champions rather than any assumed loyalty to @entity0			1
a small knot of devoted fans will take the internal flight from @entity106 to @entity13 but the costs of doing this every other week soon add up			0
@entity0 's @entity109 , who has been linked to @entity110 , trains ahead of the match with @entity5 @entity0 captain @entity112 controls the ball as the team prepare for their last 16 , first leg match @entity0 coach @entity116 has done his best to keep the team going through the crisis there has been no violence between fans of @entity0 and @entity96 though some locals have protested at this bigger , brasher , more successful club pitching up to play in their backyard			1
but there 's no doubt the exile is affecting a team chasing their sixth consecutive @entity11 league title and seeking to better their previous best in the @entity4 , a quarter - final exit to @entity132 in 2010 - 11			2
their players have been forced to leave their homes and set up camp in @entity13 but their results have been better on the road than in their temporary accommodation			0
some of the club 's @entity141 players were reluctant to return from their winter training camp in @entity145 , concerned about the security situation , but they were persuaded to carry on			0
@entity101 , the @entity5 boss , gives his pre-match press conference in @entity13 on monday night @entity5 goalkeeper @entity149 waves as @entity5 arrived at the @entity13 for their training session @entity151 arrives in @entity11 for the @entity4 last 16 , first leg encounter @entity5 's @entity153 steps off the coach in chilly @entity13 ' for us , it 's a big problem , because we are not playing at home , we are playing away , a new arena , ' said @entity0 captain @entity112			1
' you do n't have the power like you have at the @entity14			2
the @entity14 is something special - it 's our stadium , it 's our fans , it 's our city			0
' indeed , given these extraordinary circumstances , it is remarkable @entity116 's team are five points behind @entity167 and still in with a shout of retaining their league crown			2
the prospect of facing @entity5 , the runaway @entity173 leaders who stuffed eight goals past @entity175 at the weekend , is something completely different , however .			0

@entity0 will play @entity61 champions in @entity13 , 750 miles from their home
@entity14 was *damaged* when @entity23 rebels shelled it
the club do n't expect to return there until next year at the earliest
@entity13 will be sold out for @entity4 tie but some locals have not taken too kindly to @entity0 moving in
they are currently five points behind @entity167 at top of league
