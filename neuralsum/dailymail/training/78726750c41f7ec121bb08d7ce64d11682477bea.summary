by @entity0 published : 08:33 est , 29 november 2013 @entity2 : 10:56 est , 29 november 2013 around 6,000 people in the @entity4 every year have major limbs amputated and in the @entity7 , this figure rises to a staggering 185,000 - creating an ever - increasing need for more life - like prosthetics			1
a team of researchers has developed a procedure that involves reassigning nerves in other parts of the amputee 's body meaning they can control their prosthetics using brain signals			1
this team of scientists and doctors from the @entity22 ( @entity22 ) developed the procedure called targeted muscle reinnervation ( @entity25 )			1
a team of researchers in @entity28 has developed a procedure that involves reassigning nerves in other parts of an amputee 's body meaning they can control prosthetics using brain signals			1
doctors have already used the treatment successfully on amputee @entity35 , pictured they have already used the treatment successfully on an electrical line worker from @entity28 and are offering the treatment to the public			1
during a report looking into the business of bionics by @entity43 , line worker @entity35 said : ‘ it 's actually amazing , i actually feel these arms are part of me , and i 'm running them			0
’ @entity35 lost both his arms during an accident at work in 2010			0
the therapy involved reassigning nerves that once controlled his arms and hands , to his chest and in particular his pectoral muscles , through a complex series of nerve treatments and muscle transfer			0
this was coupled with physical therapy			0
following his treatment , @entity35 was fitted with prosthetics that he can control just by thinking about moving them			1
the @entity22 also recently created the world ’s first prosthetic leg that can be controlled using brain signals			1
amputee @entity35 , pictured , lost both his arms during an accident at work in 2010			0
the therapy involved reassigning nerves that once controlled his arms and hands , to his chest , through a series of nerve treatments and muscle transfer			0
he can now use his prosthetics like real limbs in october researchers unveiled the world 's first bionic man complete with circulatory system and a beating heart called @entity84 , left			1
the six - foot robot is made up of artificial body parts has 200 processors and is covered in a million sensors			2
it was designed by dr @entity90 from the @entity91 , right but , these kind of breakthroughs are expensive			0
the @entity43 report quotes the cost for developing the leg at around $ 8 million which the institute received in funding from the @entity101 ’s @entity100			1
the centre is focused on creating prosthetic limbs , among other medical breakthroughs , to help soldiers in the country ’s armed forces			1
in the @entity4 , similar work is being carried out by researchers from @entity110 in @entity111			1
the team there have also been working on micro-processor limbs , known as ‘ bionic legs ’ , as prosthetics to replace the limbs lost by members of the armed forces wounded in @entity120 and @entity121			1
in may researchers from @entity123 used 3d printing to create a bionic ear that can ' hear ' radio frequencies beyond the range of normal human ears			2
earlier this year , doctors from @entity130 similarly used 3d printing to create a prosthetic ear using cells of cartilage to make it look more like the real thing			1
@entity138 - based @entity137 recently collaborated with @entity139 to produce prosthetic eyes that are barely distinguishable from the real thing			2
and in october researchers unveiled the world 's first walking , talking bionic man complete with circulatory system and a beating heart called @entity84			2
@entity148 , the six - foot robot is made up of artificial body parts donated by various research centres from around the world , has 200 processors and is covered in over a million sensors			2
the unit recently announced it had received funding from the @entity156 to help develop this technology			0
however , these centres are n’t the only ones working on developing bionic technology and the advancements in 3d printing have helped speed up these developments			2

doctors from @entity130 similarly used 3d printing to create a prosthetic ear using cells of cartilage to make it look more like the real thing			0
researchers from @entity123 recently created a bionic ear , pictured			0
it consists of a coiled antenna inside a cartilage structure			0
two wires lead from the base of the ear and wind around a helical ' cochlea ' - the part of the ear that senses sound - which can connect to electrodes @entity138 - based @entity137 recently collaborated with @entity139 to produce prosthetic eyes that are barely distinguishable from the real thing			0
then in october researchers unveiled the world 's first walking , talking bionic man complete with circulatory system and a beating heart			0
called @entity84 - short for @entity196 - the six - foot robot is made up of artificial body parts donated by various research centres from around the world , has 200 processors and is covered in over a million sensors			0
@entity138 - based @entity137 recently collaborated with @entity139 to produce prosthetic eyes that are barely distinguishable from the real thing , pictured it was designed by dr @entity90 from the @entity91 , built by a team of engineers at @entity204 in @entity138 and is currently on display at the @entity206 in @entity207 as part of @entity210 exhibition			0
aside from being life changing , the demand for prosthetic limbs means it ’s a lucrative business as well			1
the @entity43 report claims that last year the market across the @entity7 , @entity216 and @entity217 was between $ 850 and $ 900 million ( £ 520 million and £ 551 million )			1
the worldwide market for prosthetics is expected to grow to $ 23.5 billion by 2017			1
it is also crossing over into other markets , namely consumer technology			0
prosthetic technology firm @entity223 has created a hand so advanced it can be controlled using a smartphone app. @entity227 prosthetic hand also features a rotating thumb , five individually powered fingers , a rotatable wrist and aluminium chassis			0
the hand can be controlled using an app but it can also pick up on muscle signals a prosthetic technology company called @entity223 has created a hand which is so advanced it can be controlled using a smartphone app , pictured			2

around a million people worldwide lose major limbs each year
researchers in @entity28 have developed a procedure that lets amputees control prosthetics using brain signals
while scientists in @entity111 are working on a micro-processor limbs for injured members of the armed forces
the prosthetic limb market is expected to grow to $ *2.5* billion by 2017
