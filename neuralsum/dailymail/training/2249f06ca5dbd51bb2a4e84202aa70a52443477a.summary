by @entity1 reporter as cycling has blossomed in popularity across the world , so too have road deaths associated with it			0
but one designer has come up with an ingenious idea to make traveling by bike safer : an led - lit hover - ring that allows cyclists to soar above the @entity13 on a donut - shaped overpass that looks more like a ufo than a cycle path			0
designed by @entity17 , the ' @entity18 ' was commissioned by the @entity20 city of @entity21 to ' hover ' over a busy motorway intersection that has seen a number of accidents to cyclists in recent years			1
safety first : the ' @entity18 ' was commissioned by the @entity20 city of @entity21 to ' hover ' over a busy motorway intersection that has seen a number of accidents to cyclists in recent years flying saucer : the led - lit hovenring looks more like a ufo than a cycle path ' like a flying saucer , ' the firm 's website says , ' the steel bridge hovers above the @entity39 / @entity38 intersection , its impressive pylon marking the entrance way to the cities of @entity21 and @entity43			1
' there used to be a level crossing here , but the development of a nearby housing estate meant the intersection needed changing in order to cope with growing traffic			1
gateway : the steel bridge will ' hover ' above the @entity39 / @entity38 intersection , marking the entrance to the cities of @entity21 and @entity43 new idea : the firm says there used to be a level crossing there , but the development of a nearby housing estate meant the intersection needed changing in order to cope with growing traffic safer all round : lights attached to a cable framework in between the pylon and bridge deck and to the inner surface of the circular counterweight illuminate the intersection underneath , making it a safer place for pedestrians as well heavyweight : a 230 - foot tall central pylon was erected , which was then connected by 24 steel cables to the circular bridge deck to hold a structure weighing more than one million kilograms ' as @entity75 refrains from cyclist underpasses and didnâ € ™ t want a level crossing roundabout either , they asked ( us ) to look at possible solutions			1
a circular cable - stayed bridge soon appeared to be the best option			0
' it adds that ' the functional lighting is integrated into the railing , where led - lighting illuminates the bridge deck and ensures facial recognition of the bridge users at the same time '			0
lights attached to a cable framework in between the pylon and bridge deck and to the inner surface of the circular counterweight illuminate the intersection underneath , making it a safer place for pedestrians as well			2
construction started on february 11 2011 and the suspended roundabout opened the following december			0
a 230 - foot tall central pylon was erected , which was then connected by 24 steel cables to the circular bridge deck to hold a structure weighing more than one million kilograms			1
but within a few weeks , unexpected vibrations in the cables caused by wind forced it to be closed while engineers worked to fix the problem			0
after extensive research by structural experts , high frequency and low frequency vibration dampeners were attached to the cables to resolve the vibration issues			2
the @entity18 officially reopened to the public on 29 june 2012 .			2

the ' @entity18 ' will ' hover ' over a busy motorway in @entity20 city @entity21
new housing estate meant crossing needed changing to cope with traffic
it 's held in *air* by 230ft pylon attached to 24 cables and weights *1m* kilos
