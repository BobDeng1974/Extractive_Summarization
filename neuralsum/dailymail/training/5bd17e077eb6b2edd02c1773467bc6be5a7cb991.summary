by @entity0 published : 09:21 est , 28 november 2012 updated : 08:10 est , 29 november 2012 dozens of historic spitfires set to be dug up after they were discovered buried in the @entity4 jungle could be flying again within three years , according to the man who spent 16 years searching for the planes			1
@entity8 farmer @entity7 , 62 , spent over a decade and more than £ 130,000 of his own money working to track down the aircraft , after being told by a group of @entity13 veterans they were buried there at the end of the @entity16			1
in january archaeologists will begin digging for the planes so they can be painstakingly packaged up and transported back to the @entity8 for restoration , and mr @entity7 has said he believes the spitfires - which have been underground for 67 years - will take to the skies once more			1
@entity30 1996 aviation enthusiast mr @entity7 , from @entity31 , @entity21 , was told the rare @entity32 were buried there in crates in august 1945			1
he subsequently spent two years researching the project , eventually gathering eight eye - witness reports backing up the claims			0
surveys undertaken at one of three sites in @entity4 have indicated the presence of large areas of electrically conductive material around 10 metres beneath the surface of the ground			0
the location matches the eight eye - witness reports collected by mr @entity7 , who has made 16 visits to @entity4 over the years conducting surveys and negotiating with authorities			1
his project reached a landmark junction earlier this year when sanctions blocking the movement of military materials in and out of @entity4 were lifted , according to a report in @entity57			0
' hopefully they will be brought back to the @entity8 and will be flying at air shows , ' he told the newspaper			1
' we have had offers from @entity8 companies to restore them and put their logos on them which is acceptable to me			2
' it should take two to three years to restore them so we should see something in the next three years or so , ' he added			0
one of the @entity69 ( pictured : the tail fins ) being crated up in @entity4 in 1945 ready to be buried in all three groups have been given permission to look for the planes , but only mr @entity7 - who eventually located the planes using ground penetrating radar equipment - was able to find anything			1
after being led to the area by an eye - witness , the farmer 's team dug a borehole and sent a camera down to capture footage of the crates , which were found to be in ' really good condition '			1
mr @entity7 has now been given exclusive rights to all three sites under investigation in @entity4			1
@entity91 , the archaeologist leading the january dig , said the team will removing and examining a layer of soil at a time			0
he said that , whatever the outcome of the project , the team would have a ' cracking story ' to tell			0
an excavation agreement was signed last month by mr @entity7 , @entity4 's civil aviation chief @entity101 and the @entity103 company boss @entity104 , mr @entity7 's partner in the country mr @entity107 said at the time : ' this will be the largest number of @entity69 in the world			1
we want to let people see those historic fighters			0
' mr @entity7 's treasure hunt was sparked in 1996 by a throwaway remark from a group of @entity13 veterans who said they had once buried @entity69 in the @entity4 jungle			1
the @entity69 , of which there are only around 35 flying left in the world , were shipped to @entity4 and transported by rail to the @entity8 @entity124 base in august 1945			2
a place in history : a poster unveiling the @entity69 from around 1939 mr @entity7 persuaded the country 's notoriously secretive regime to allow him to search for the lost aircraft , winning their trust over several visits			1
the married father - of - three doggedly pieced together their possible location by speaking to the declining number of @entity138 veterans he said at the time : ' i ’m only a small farmer , i ’m not a multi-millionaire and it has been a struggle			0
it took me more than 15 years but i finally found them			0
' spitfires are beautiful aeroplanes and should not be rotting away in a foreign land			0
they saved our neck in the @entity151 and they should be preserved			0
' permission to excavate the planes was granted because of the strengthening relations between @entity155 and @entity156			0
in the past year , @entity4 has turned away from the repressive policies of the previous military regime and has taken a reforming democratic stance			0
a @entity161 spokesman said : ' we hope that many of them will be gracing the skies of @entity8 and as discussed , some will be displayed here in @entity4			2
' mr @entity7 said the government had promised him it would not be making a claim for the aircraft			2
a law passed by the @entity8 when they granted @entity4 independence in 1948 meant that anything left behind automatically became the property of the @entity4 government			2
mr @entity7 is understood to have struck a deal with the @entity4 president to take 60 per cent of the profits .			2
