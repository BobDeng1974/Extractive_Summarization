earlier this year , a groundbreaking experiment claimed to have detected what happened in the first billionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second after the @entity7			2
astronomers using the @entity10 telescope said they found evidence for the faint microwave glow left over from the event that signalled the start of the universe			1
but since then the research has come under increasing scrutiny - and now scientists claim that if the results were true , the universe as we know it would not exist at all			1
new research from @entity23 suggests that , if the @entity10 results announced in march are correct , then the universe should have collapsed less than a second after the @entity7 ( illustration shown ) , unless there is an unexplained realm of particle physics at work holding the cosmos together according to astronomers from @entity23 ( @entity23 ) , the universe should have existed for no more than a second before collapsing			1
the research is the result of combining the latest observations of the sky , with the recent discovery of the @entity40			0
it was hailed as a groundbreaking experiment to detect what happened in the first billionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second after the @entity7			2
however , following a rash of criticism , the researchers behind the @entity10 experiment hailed as a massive breakthrough have admitted they may have made a mistake			1
last week the @entity10 collaboration formally published its research in a peer reviewed journal - @entity58 ( @entity58 ) - and a key researcher admitted even he has lost some confidence in the original results			2
in the paper , the @entity63 - led group stands by its work but accepts some big questions remain outstanding			0
' has my confidence gone down ? yes , ' professor @entity69 , from the @entity70 , told his audience at a public lecture in @entity73			0
after the universe began in the @entity7 , it is thought to have gone through a short period of rapid expansion known as ' cosmic inflation '			1
although the details of this process are not yet fully understood , cosmologists have been able to make predictions of how this would affect the universe we see today			0
in march 2014 , researchers from the @entity10 collaboration claimed to have detected one of these predicted effects			1
if true , their results are a major advance in our understanding of cosmology and a confirmation of the inflation theory , but they have proven controversial and are not yet fully accepted by cosmologists			2
but in the new research , scientists from @entity23 investigated what the @entity10 observations would mean for the stability of the universe - with surprising results			1
to do this , they combined the results with recent advances in particle physics			1
gravitational waves from cosmic inflation generate a faint but distinctive twisting pattern in the universe			1
shown here is the pattern observed with the @entity10 telescope , providing what was thought at the time to be evidence for cosmic inflation after the @entity7			1
the results have now been called into question the @entity10 telescope in @entity122 is seen here at twilight			2
the telescope has led to significant new results on the early universe , although its recent results have been called into question			2
the @entity130 telescope and the @entity131 can be seen in the background the detection of the @entity40 by the @entity134 was announced in july 2012 ; since then , much has been learned about its properties			0
the @entity40 's role is to give the particles that make up atoms their mass. it has been described as the ‘ missing piece ’ of the @entity142 , which explains how the parts of the universe that we understand interact with one another without this mass , particles would zip around the cosmos , unable to bind together to form the atoms that make stars and planets - and people			0
the particle was confirmed using the @entity134 - the highest - energy particle collider ever made , built by the @entity155 ( @entity155 ) in 2012			0
however , our knowledge of particle physics is still far from complete , with mysteries such as the nature of dark matter to still be solved			2
measurements of the @entity40 have allowed particle physicists to show that the universe sits in a valley of the ' @entity40 ' , which describes the way that other particles have mass. however , there is a different valley which is much deeper , but our universe is prevented from falling into it by a large energy barrier			0
the problem is that the @entity10 results predict the universe would have received large ' kicks ' during the cosmic inflation phase , pushing it into the other valley of the @entity40 within a fraction of a second			1
if that had happened , the universe would have quickly collapsed in a ' @entity184 '			0
' this is an unacceptable prediction of the theory because if this had happened we would n't be around to discuss it , ' said @entity190 , who is a phd student at @entity23 and led the study			0
the scientists claim the @entity10 results may contain an error ; if not , there must be some other , as yet unknown , process which prevented the universe from collapsing			1
' if @entity10 is shown to be correct , it tells us that there has to be interesting new particle physics beyond the standard model , ' @entity190 said			1
our universe lies in a ' valley ' , which sets the behaviour of the @entity40			0
our universe is prevented from entering a deeper valley by a large ' hill '			0
during the early period of cosmic inflation , the @entity10 results imply that the @entity207 would have received a ' kick ' into the other valley , causing it to collapse in less than a second the @entity10 experiment was hailed as a look at the very brief moment of time at the beginning of everything when the universe expanded very rapidly - a theory called cosmic inflation			1
however , researchers later said the team did not take into account dust in the @entity224 galaxy , which may have rendered their readings useless			0
two independent analyses now suggest that those twisting patterns in the @entity230 polarisation could just as easily be accounted for by the dust			0
and the team say there simply is n't enough data to rule out the dust theory .			0

in march 2014 , the @entity10 experiment found evidence of the universe expanding rapidly after the @entity7 , also known as ' cosmic inflation '
@entity23 scientists now claim @entity10 results may be *wrong*
if the experiment was correct , the universe should have collapsed
this would have occurred less than a second after the @entity7
*alternatively* , existence could be explained by unknown particle physics
since march the results have come under increasing scrutiny
