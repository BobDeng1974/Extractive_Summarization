by @entity1 reporter published : 16:44 est , 13 august 2013 updated : 16:50 est , 13 august 2013 a tv science - fiction fan who built what is being described as the ' world 's first practical jetpack ' , has been given permission to carry out manned test - flights			1
@entity9 began building jetpacks in his garage more than thirty years ago , inspired by programmes such as @entity13 and @entity14			1
over the years he has gone through a number of prototypes , founding the @entity17 based in @entity18 , @entity19 along the way			1
previous versions have flown to 5000ft but only with dummies on board			2
the @entity24 has a range of 30km and a total flight time of 30 minutes			1
although described as a jetpack it is technically a miniaturised helicopter as it uses small fans as opposed to jet engines for thrust			2
@entity17 chief executive @entity38 told @entity39 : ' changing the position of the jetpack 's ducts has resulted in a quantum leap in performance over the previous prototype , especially in terms of the aircraft 's maneuverability			2
' for us it 's a very important step because it moves it out of what i call a dream into something which i believe we 're now in a position to commercialise and take forward very quickly			0
' the @entity58 soars through the sky albeit with a dummy pilot			0
the company has now been granted permission to carry out manned test flights the @entity24 hovers above the @entity19 countryside with a helicopter close by steady a she goes : the @entity9 p12 jetpack is put through its paces during an earlier test flight designer mr @entity9 wanted to create a device that could be used on a daily basis by people with no pilot training			1
it consists of two propulsion fans enclosed in cyclinders which are attached to a free - standing carbon - fibre frame on either side			0
the pilot straps himself in and uses a pair of joysticks to steer			0
the device is also equipped with a rocket - propelled parachute in case something goes wrong			0
although originally designed for recreational use , as a plaything for multi-millionaires , the company says there has been strong interest from the commercial sector			0
the device is equipped with a rocket - propelled parachute for use in the event of an emergency the device could also have military applications or be used to patrol borders or by emergency services for rapid response			0
the @entity19 aviation authority has granted permission for manned test flights although they will be limited to no more than six metres and can only be carried out over uninhabited areas			1
the company hopes to begin delivery next year with an estimated price of between £ 97,000 and £ 160,000 , although they hope to bring the cost down over time			1
