as the @entity2 players struggle to come to terms with their disastrous @entity5 campaign , @entity0 has apologised to the nation for the performances			1
he has also pledged his support for @entity9 as @entity2 manager , and insisted that @entity2 need to become less ‘ honest ’ in their approach to the game			1
speaking in the wake of his team ’s elimination , @entity0 said			1
‘ the fans have been incredible to us , flying all this way and giving us the support they have			1
back home there were kids staying up late and watching the games			1
out here , the fans have been amazing			1
‘ it ’s not the easiest place for them to come , so we appreciate the efforts they have made and we ’re sorry for not going through			1
we ’ve dedicated our lives to this tournament and unfortunately we have n’t succeeded			1
we appreciate everything they ’ve done for us			1
hopefully , one day soon , we ’ll give them something to smile about			1
’ his support for @entity9 was unequivocal			1
‘ @entity9 is a fantastic manager and fantastic person in my eyes , and he ’s the right man to take us forward , ’ he said			1
‘ he ’s brought a lot of youth and excitement into the team			1
it has n’t worked out in this tournament , but he ’s certainly got his plans set in place in the next two years , and we ’ll try and execute those plans			1
‘ if you look over the previous two or three tournaments , we ’ve not attacked teams			1
this time , we ’ve had a go			1
in other tournaments we ’ve wondered if we could ’ve done things differently once we were out , but we ’ve had a go here			1
but it ’s not gone our way			2
‘ @entity9 ’s hurting too			1
it ’s hard to take			2
there ’s no way round it			2
it ’s tough on us , tough on the fans , but it ’s something we have to try and move on from quickly and put right			1
’ he insisted one of the major lessons learned was for @entity79 foot - ball to become more street-wise : ‘ you look at teams who have won the tournament over previous years and you can see that nastiness in them			2
' i think we need to get that in us			2
maybe we ’re too honest , i feel , as a team			2
in terms of @entity91 the other night , they stopped the game , they committed i do n’t know how many fouls ... clever fouls , really , to slow the game down			2
‘ i think we ’re a bit honest in terms of the way we play			2
but those small things can amount to a big thing in terms of staying in or going out			2
if we can learn that quickly and adapt to that , i think we ’ll do better			2
‘ you see players surrounding the referees — i ’m not saying @entity91 did that — but i ’m the same now			2
i want to win the game			2
i got kicked 10 times and i do n’t think there was a yellow card given to an opponent			2
' we try and be honest , but maybe that ’s a fault of ours			2
but we gave everything to try and win			0
it ’s tough ... we have to stay strong and try and improve			0
’ gone : @entity2 were knocked out of the @entity5 after failing to win their first two @entity121 games chance : @entity0 's second half goal against @entity91 gave @entity2 hope before @entity125 scored the winner at 28 , @entity0 has played international football for 11 years and speaks with the experience of three @entity129			1
the outstanding @entity79 player of his generation , he is aware his remarkable talent has never found adequate expression at the highest level			0
he is also aware that this festival in @entity137 may well have been his last chance , and he tried to conceal his frustration			0
‘ it ’s difficult to sit here and say i enjoyed the tournament , because we ’re out			0
it ’s tough going out of the tournament like that			0
we have to remember how we feel at this moment and use that pain			0
’ asked if there was consolation in the fact he scored his first @entity5 goal against @entity91 , @entity0 almost snorted : ‘ i scored a goal , but we lost , we ’re out of the tournament			1
that ’s all that matters			0
' this team ’s much bigger than @entity0			1
i ’m just a part of this team			0
it ’s not through lack of trying			0
we tried , but we did n’t succeed			0
’ it was pointed out that @entity0 ran more than anyone at this tournament			1
‘ i believe i ’ve got many years left in me			0
i feel good , ’ he said			0
‘ we get stats daily from training and games , and i ’m always in the top two or three			0
sometimes it affects decision - making inside the box , being tired from doing too much			0
' maybe i should run around a bit less ! but playing for your country , you want to try and do well and work for the team , whether that ’s up front , behind the forward or wide			0
’ hope : @entity2 's team before they took on @entity188 , not knowing that they 'd be out less than a week later @entity189 : @entity0 's performance against the @entity191 was widely criticised assist : @entity0 ( left ) set up @entity193 for @entity2 's opening goal of the tournament despite his stress on the team ethic , he has solid ambitions of beating sir @entity200 ’s record of 49 @entity2 goals			1
‘ of course , ’ he said			0
‘ it ’s within touching distance			0
i ’ll be disappointed if i do n’t do it			0
i feel i ’ve many years left			0
if i do n’t get the 10 goals to beat the record , i ’ll have no one to blame but myself			0
it would be a great achievement			0
but this is about the team			0
collectively , we ’re disappointed			0
i do n’t want to be talking about my chances of breaking records when we ’re all hurting			0
’ @entity2 have four @entity217 qualifiers before @entity218			1
did he believe the supporters needed to be patient with the young team ’s efforts ? ‘ we have to start well because we want to be in the next tournament , ’ he said			0
‘ we just have to do well in those			0
the fans will see some exciting football , but we have to turn that exciting football into results			1
that ’s the plan , that ’s the aim			0
‘ @entity9 has moved us forward in my eyes since the previous tournament			1
i know we have n’t progressed from the group , but he ’s moved us forward			1
i know it ’s tough to say that or believe that now , but i ’ve been in this squad for over 10 years now and that ’s being truthful and honest			0
