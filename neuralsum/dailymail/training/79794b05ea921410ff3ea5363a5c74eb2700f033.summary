improved car design and safety technology means that crash fatalities are in rapid decline , according to a new industry report			0
the @entity5 found that in 2012 there were 28 driver deaths per million cars produced in 2011			1
this compared to 48 for 2008 and 2009 vehicle models , marking a 41per cent decrease in motoring deaths over three years of manufacturing			1
' these latest death rates provide new confirmation that real - world outcomes are improving , too			0
' crucial changes that could have saved lives include the redesign of airbags and seat belts			1
many car brands worked at developing stronger structures and kitting models out with safety gizmos such as anti-lock brakes and electronic stability controls			0
a weak economy was also attributed to the fall in motoring deaths as it could have led to a reduction in driving			2
but the gap between safest and riskiest models remains wide			0
three 2011 models had rates exceeding 100 deaths per million registered vehicle years			1
the riskiest models also were mostly lower - priced , small cars , while the safest models were all mid-sized or large vehicles			2
the nine models with zero deaths were the @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity61 hybrid , @entity62 and @entity63			0
drop in deaths : crucial changes that could have saved lives include the redesign of airbags and seat belts the vehicles with the highest death rates were the @entity71 , 149 deaths per million registered vehicles ; @entity74 , 130 deaths , and @entity76 , 120 deaths			1
the institute has published death rates by make and model periodically since 1989 , at first for cars only and later for all passenger vehicles			0
the rates include only driver deaths because the presence of passengers is unknown			0
although the latest numbers reflect 2011 models , the study included data from earlier - model year vehicles as far back as 2008 if the vehicles were n't substantially redesigned before 2011			2
including older , equivalent vehicles increases the exposure and thus the accuracy of the results , the institute said			0
to be included , a vehicle must have had at least 100,000 registered vehicle years of exposure during 2009 - 12 , or at least 20 deaths			2
the @entity5 examined fatalities involving 2011 model year vehicles , looking at how many driver fatalities occurred in a particular model over the course of a year of operation , expressed as a rate per million registered vehicle years			1
