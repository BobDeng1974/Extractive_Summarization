it could be one of the oldest bugs in the computer world			0
@entity3 today issued a patch for a major security hole in its @entity7 software that it admitted has been there for 19 years			1
experts at @entity11 spotted the bug - and found it was even present in the code for @entity15			1
@entity16 in 1995 during rehearsals for the august 24 launch of @entity15			0
researchers have found a serious security flaw in the software remained in @entity7 systems until this week , when the firm finally patched it			0
the bug , which is present in every version of @entity7 from @entity15 onward , allows an attacker to remotely take over and control a computer			1
typically , attackers use remote code execution to install malware , which may have any number of malicious actions , such as keylogging , screen - grabbing and remote access			0
@entity11 's cybersecurity research team discovered the bug in may , describing it as a ' significant vulnerability ' in the operating system			2
' the buggy code is at least 19 years old and has been remotely exploitable for the past 18 years , ' @entity11 x-force research team said in its blog on tuesday			1
the bug , which is present in every version of @entity7 from @entity15 onward , allows an attacker to remotely take over and control a computer			1
' we reported this issue with a working proof - of - concept exploit back in may 2014 , and today , @entity3 is patching it , ' they said			2
' it can be exploited remotely since @entity51 ( @entity51 ) 3.0			0
' this complex vulnerability is a rare , ' unicorn - like ' bug found in code that @entity51 relies on but does n't necessarily belong to it			2
@entity3 finally fixed the flaw this week with a security patch it urged all users to download ' the bug can be used by an attacker for drive - by attacks to reliably run code remotely and take over the user 's machine ' looking at the original release code of @entity15 , the problem is present			1
' typically , attackers use remote code execution to install malware , which may have any number of malicious actions , such as keylogging , screen - grabbing and remote access , the researchers say .			0
