@entity0 and @entity1 meet on tuesday evening in the first leg of the @entity4 semi-final , thus continuing a fierce modern rivalry that has thrown up many thrilling contests			1
there has been no shortage of controversial incidents in the last few years , from @entity11 's ' ghost goal ' to @entity12 biting @entity13			1
and in the build - up to the match , @entity0 manager @entity14 admitted the rivalry is now so intense he can no longer be close friends with opposite number @entity19			1
but it 's a match that does n't quite compare to the great traditional rivalries of the @entity24 game , the ones akin to two tribes going to war			1
so with apologies to the good people of @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity44 , here 's our rundown of the nation 's bitterest football rivalries			1
the infamous moment when @entity12 bit @entity13 during a @entity0 vs @entity1 game in 2013 @entity50 tries to wrestle the ball from @entity1 manager @entity19 during last season 's encounter @entity55 v @entity54 if there really is one rivalry in @entity24 football that genuinely is about more than sport then this it			1
religion , national identity and history all play a part in what has become known as the @entity65			0
the strength of feeling has certainly led to some remarkable scenes on the football pitch but , sadly , too many away from the action that we would rather forget			0
the @entity55 vs @entity54 rivalry in @entity73 is one that transcends football into politics , religion and society @entity77 of @entity54 smiles after grounding @entity55 's @entity78 during a clash in 1987 @entity55 's @entity80 is confronted by four @entity54 players during an @entity65 match in november 2004 and @entity80 the manager squares up to @entity54 boss @entity84 after a game at @entity86 in 2011 a classic @entity65 punch - up in the goalmouth at @entity86 during a league clash in april 2002 @entity54 striker @entity90 confronts @entity55 manager @entity80 during a @entity4 meeting in march 2011 @entity92 v @entity0 @entity92 – given their size , success and location – have more rivalries than they care to think about			1
ask their supporters for their feelings about @entity99 and @entity100 , for example , and stand back and prepare to listen			2
this is the only one that really counts , though			0
as sir @entity104 used to say : ‘ @entity0 always have been , and always will be , our greatest rivals ’			1
music , culture , the @entity109			0
if there is an argument to be had about something , the citizens of these two great cities will have it			0
when it comes to football , however , the fundamentals remain the same			0
years of chasing the same trophies and trying to buy the same players so that they could boast the same thing – ‘ we are the best in @entity123 ’ – have taken a deep toll			2
the rivalry is deep , it is real , it is bitter and it will never change			2
@entity0 captain @entity50 stands over @entity92 's @entity128 during a recent encounter the @entity12 racism allegations against @entity92 's @entity131 is just one of many flashpoints @entity134 gives @entity135 a piece of his mind during the @entity139 meeting last season @entity92 's @entity141 is on the receiving end of a flying kick from @entity0 keeper @entity144 @entity146 v @entity145 former @entity145 manager – and one - time @entity149 centre forward – @entity150 once described this rivalry as ' greater than that between @entity149 and @entity153 '			1
from that point of view , it ’s worth taking seriously and its credentials for respect are also hardened by the fact its @entity162 ’s oldest derby , dating back to 1888			1
at first glance , both towns have much in common			0
they are only eight miles apart , both have been floored by the gradual erosion and decline of the north ’s great industries and both – as a result – are patronised and ridiculed by the likes of nearby @entity109 and @entity0			1
perhaps this is just it , though			0
when nobody else cares about you , what other option is there other than to care about each other ? @entity146 fans are held back by police and stewards after their 2005 @entity186 fifth - round tie with @entity145 @entity145 's @entity187 is thrown to the floor as tempers flare in the @entity191 derby in 2000 @entity193 v @entity192 to many , it ’s parochial and rather meaningless			1
after all , neither of these two clubs have won a meaningful trophy since @entity192 lifted the @entity186 almost 42 years ago			1
however , the mutual hatred between these two cities is another that transcends football			0
this one is about coal , politics and regional pride			0
if you do n’t believe me then google ‘ the @entity213 ’ ( it took place in 1644 ) and consider the fact that some people in @entity193 still refuse to eat bacon			1
why ? because it ’s red and white			0
players clash during the @entity216 between @entity193 and @entity192 in 2012 @entity193 's @entity217 trades blows with @entity192 's @entity219 at the @entity220 in 2011 @entity193 fans do n't take too kindly to a home defeat by @entity192 in 2013 @entity224 v @entity223 in 1988 , having seen their team win in @entity223 , a group of @entity224 fans were actually chased in to the sea by supporters of the home team			1
that fact , in itself , gives this rivalry a unique story to tell			2
five years later , though , things grew a little more serious when @entity223 fans tore seats from the stand at @entity239 and began to throw them at their rivals			2
a pitch invasion followed and , as a result , away fans were banned from these games for several years			2
interestingly , there is little history to this rivalry beyond football			2
in 1927 , for example , many @entity223 fans actually travelled to @entity251 to cheer @entity224 on against @entity252 in the @entity253			2
things only got heated in the 1980s as football hooliganism began to take a grip of the @entity24			2
a heavy police presence at the @entity258 keeps apart supporters of @entity223 and @entity224 @entity261 v @entity260 @entity261 have their own neighbours , of course			2
you had probably hit a six iron from the centre circle of the @entity267 and locate your ball in @entity269 ’ s car park a few minutes later			0
@entity271 , though , are not even on @entity261 ’s radar when compared to their feelings with their other local foes from down the @entity275			0
again there is a manufacturing argument at its roots – this time a row over the production of lace that goes back to the @entity282 – but it was the great @entity283 ’s switch from @entity260 to @entity261 in the 1970s that really got this one off the ground			0
as events at @entity287 on saturday showed , the hate goes on …			0
a @entity260 supporter runs onto the pitch to attack @entity261 players after saturday 's match @entity292 v @entity252 the highest scoring derby in the @entity295 , this one has its roots in geography , with the clubs ’ stadia being just four miles apart			1
in recent times , people like @entity300 and @entity301 have managed and played for both clubs , deepening the enmity			0
many supporters wo n’t know , though , that the clubs have been arguing with each other since 1919 when @entity252 – rather than @entity292 - were voted in to an expanded @entity308 , despite finishing six places further down the old league structure			1
players from @entity252 and @entity292 square up and @entity312 during their march 2013 meeting @entity314 gets into a scrap with @entity316 during a heated @entity317 in 1991 @entity252 's @entity318 brings down a spectator invading the pitch at @entity321 in 1985 some rather aggressive tackling from players of both teams during this 1968 @entity4 clash at @entity321 @entity327 v @entity326 not surprisingly , given their coastal locations , this rivalry is predominantly about boats			1
mutual dislike and suspicion between two ports located 30 miles apart has been around for centuries but historians pinpoint the sinking of the @entity337 in 1912 as a key moment in time			0
sailors from @entity326 refused to crew her sister ship @entity342 , due to the lack of lifeboats			0
dockers from @entity327 had no such issue , though , arriving in @entity326 in the middle of the night to effectively take their work			0
when looked at like this , @entity350 ’s flitting between the two clubs ten years ago suddenly does n't look like such a big deal			2
@entity327 fans make their feelings known to @entity350 after his switch to rivals @entity326 riot police line up in front of the travelling fans as @entity327 host @entity326 at @entity362 in 2004 @entity364 v @entity363 this one may now continue its life outside the @entity368 structure but on it goes , so much so that both sets of supporters still arrive at each other ’s grounds on match day under heavy police escort			0
@entity377 police actually claim that this fixture carries with it a greater risk of hooliganism than the @entity109 derby			0
the fact that one of these towns is in @entity162 and the other is in @entity386 does n’t help , of course …			2
. masses of police swarm in to separate fans of @entity364 and @entity363 during their meeting earlier this season @entity393 v @entity394 back in the day the supporters of these clubs were largely dockers and ship yard workers competing for the same business on the same stretch of the @entity401			1
so it was that the sporting – and often not very sporting – rivalry between @entity393 and @entity405 was born			1
when @entity393 moved south of the river in 1910 , the two clubs were no longer @entity408 neighbours but the rivalry remained			1
in the 1960s and 1970s members of the criminal fraternity infiltrated the scene too			0
occasionally some football was played			0
@entity394 and @entity393 fans fighting at @entity416 during the height of football hooliganism in the seventies @entity420 of @entity393 and @entity421 of @entity394 have a scrap on the ground during a 1992 meeting @entity425 has to be held back from @entity393 's @entity426 after a match in 2003 @entity394 supporters invade the pitch at @entity416 during their @entity4 tie with @entity393 in 2009 @entity394 vs @entity393 fixtures always see passions running high inside and outside the ground a bloodied fan is led away during a night of violence at the 2009 @entity4 tie at @entity416 fans confront one another at a meeting of @entity393 and @entity394 at @entity440 back in 2009			1

@entity0 and @entity1 set to meet at @entity442 in @entity4 semi-final
rivalry between the two teams has intensified in recent years
their *exciting* matches are punctuated by controversial moments
but @entity0 vs @entity1 does n't compare to true rivalries of @entity24 game
@entity55 vs @entity54 divides @entity73 along religious and political lines
@entity92 vs @entity0 is battle of @entity162 's most successful
local rivalries like @entity252 vs @entity292 , @entity394 vs @entity393 and @entity193 vs @entity192 mean so much to their supporters
