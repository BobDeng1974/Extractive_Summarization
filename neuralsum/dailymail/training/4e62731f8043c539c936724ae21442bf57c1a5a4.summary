by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 will storm the barricades of the @entity4 ’ most forbidding fortress on saturday , as an invading force stripped of half its firepower , but armed with a defiant mantra : ‘ the greater the challenge , the greater the opportunity ’			1
that is the tourists ’ optimistic official line and on such a basis , this is the greatest opportunity @entity2 have had during @entity17 ’s tenure			1
@entity18 is the venue where visiting teams ’ ambitions go to die			1
pass it on : @entity23 is watched closely by his teammates as the ball is moved from left to right fortress : the @entity4 are unbeaten at @entity28 's @entity18 stadium for 20 years toughest test : @entity17 's @entity2 side face an almighty challenge in saturday 's match @entity4 are unbeaten there since 1994 and @entity2 must try to shatter that home rule without more than a dozen key players			1
what awaits the men left standing in the path of the @entity40 juggernaut has the look of an ordeal , rather than an opportunity , but @entity44 has set a bullish tone ahead of this series opener			2
the loss of first - choice scrum - half @entity48 maintains the routine of every best - laid plan being systematically undermined by a combination of injuries and a calamitous fixture clash			2
this should have been the occasion for @entity2 to catch the hosts cold , before they settle back into their rhythm after seven months apart			1
instead , the @entity4 have the luxury of finding their feet against chronically weakened opposition			1
@entity44 will send out a capable team , but how he would wish to have @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 and @entity71 now , rather than belatedly in @entity72 and @entity73			2
@entity74 can unleash a @entity4 side with a dangerous look about it , even without his playmaker @entity78 or world player of the year @entity79			1
test of strength : @entity82 pushes weights along the pitch as his teammates watch on resistance movement : @entity87 runs while dragging weights behind him as @entity2 keep up their strength ahead of the first test hair - raising : @entity91 looks for teammates as @entity2 prepare for a stern examination against the @entity4 in @entity28 on saturday the @entity4 have 968 caps to @entity2 ’s 367 , along with the momentum from a perfect return of 14 straight victories in 2013			1
they have power , unparalleled skills , home advantage and the scent of blood in their @entity104 ’s men have hope , without the expectation			0
the match - day script is seemingly set for an emphatic defeat — but they refuse to accept that the outcome is a foregone conclusion			2
@entity23 typifies @entity2 ’s predicament here			1
the fly half who has left @entity115 to join @entity116 after a season scarred by collapsing form will be asked to wield the conductor ’s baton in the no 10 shirt , and he is adamant that he can cope with the task			1
‘ i ’m just excited , ’ said the 24 - year - old			0
‘ i do n’t see it as a task you can get too nervous about			0
it ’s a massive opportunity			2
‘ to play the @entity4 at @entity18 is something that you ca n’t be daunted by			1
we ’ve been in camp for two weeks so we are chomping at the bit			0
the support the coaches have given me in being able to stay in camp and stay up to scratch with how the team want to play has helped			0
it ’s a case of me looking forward and seizing the opportunity			2
’ @entity17 justified @entity23 ’ selection ahead of @entity139 by suggesting that he had begun to climb out of his slump towards the end of the season			1
@entity23 agreed , adding : ‘ i feel confident now			1
in the last few games for @entity115 i was getting back to myself			0
in this environment , where everyone knows their roles , i feel back to my confident self			0
prepared : @entity4 became the first team in the professional era to complete an unbeaten season in 2013 unbeaten : the @entity4 failed to lose last year , winning 14 of their test matches in 2013 bandaged : @entity154 passes the ball during their training session at @entity158 in @entity4 ‘ a big weight is off my shoulders			1
last season has been put to bed			0
‘ i see myself as a player who thrives in the big games and big atmospheres			0
if i miss the first kick — which i wo n’t — i ’ll have to move on and deal with it			0
i am more mentally strong now			0
’ he will also have to be physically strong , especially when the @entity4 ’ monster centre , @entity169 , is rampaging around the midfield			1
@entity23 expects plenty of traffic coming his way and added : ‘ i am sure to be targeted , but that is a gauntlet i have to relish			1
’ after a gaffe earlier in the week from @entity4 lock @entity154 , who could n’t name a single @entity2 player and referred to @entity68 as ‘ @entity178 ’ , the @entity4 were at pains to avoid dishing up more motivation to their rivals yesterday			1
one by one , the home players made diplomatic noises about their depleted opponents			0
‘ @entity2 are one of the best teams in the world , ’ said full back @entity185			1
‘ i ’m sure whoever is playing will do a good job			0
it ’s not going to be easy			0
’ wing @entity192 was similarly wary , adding : ‘ @entity2 have shown they ’ve got a lot of depth			1
a lot of the guys playing for them this weekend have played in the last 12 months and they will have a lot of motivation			0
’ focused : @entity4 refuse to fall for the ' poor @entity2 side ' front and expect a tough match roar : @entity203 ( right ) pushing himself to the limit with his ' confident ' @entity4 team - mates stretch : @entity4 look determined to extend their unbeaten run at @entity18 on saturday lock @entity203 suggested that the big visiting pack could cause problems			1
‘ if we do n’t front up , we will be embarrassed , ’ he said			0
and scrum - half @entity213 insisted the stereotyping of @entity2 in these parts as one - dimensional no longer applies			1
‘ they play a good brand of rugby now , ’ he said			0
‘ @entity2 scored a lot of good tries during the @entity221			1
they are a big animal and we have to show them respect			0
’ sadly , @entity225 hopes of an upset have been shattered			0
@entity17 ’s squad have sufficient fortitude to make a game of it but , ultimately , the gulf in experience and quality will be too great			1
if they can take the @entity4 to the edge then next week — when reinforcements are ready — the ordeal could become an opportunity after all			1
@entity241 v @entity239 the @entity4 loosehead is a @entity244 veteran with 107 caps			2
the 33 - year - old started all seven matches when @entity4 won the @entity248 in 2011 , scoring the crucial try in the final			2
he is a potent scrummager ; a wily prop as well as a sturdy one			0
@entity239 must resist @entity241 ’s attempts to undermine @entity2 ’s set - piece at the end of a season of considerable personal success			2
the giant @entity258 tighthead has responded well when deputising for the injured @entity259 , but he was under the cosh in a scrum contest with @entity262 during his club ’s recent defeat to @entity265 in the @entity266			0
@entity269 v @entity267 this is the clash of the captains , who lead their respective sides as opposing openside flankers			0
@entity269 is the master of his craft – a legend of the modern era who has been named @entity278 a record three times			2
he is a renowned breakdown menace who attracts grudging admiration for his ability to keep referees onside while bending the laws to his will			0
@entity267 has become widely admired as @entity2 skipper and is an energetic , influential and increasingly dynamic figure , but he is not known as a poacher of turn - overs			2
he must resist the black tide in the rucks , but will count on assistance from the likes of @entity82 and @entity295			0
@entity169 v @entity296 these wrecking - ball centres are not in direct opposition , as @entity169 will wear 12 for the @entity4 and @entity296 is at 13 for @entity2 , but they have similar roles			1
both will be charged with generating space and front - foot attacking possession by blasting holes in the opposition defensive line			0
@entity169 is a fearsome runner who has added layers of guile and artistry to his game			0
@entity296 will serve as @entity2 ’s attacking fulcrum and primary weapon			2
he is still developing the distribution range and awareness of his rival , but the strapping @entity316 is an explosive force of nature in midfield , as @entity4 discovered to their cost at @entity321 in 2012 .			2

@entity4 are unbeaten at @entity28 's @entity18 since 1994
@entity2 are bidding to break that record with an *understrength* squad
opening match against the @entity4 will be the toughest test for @entity17 's side
fly half @entity23 says he will relish his opportunity in the starting xv
