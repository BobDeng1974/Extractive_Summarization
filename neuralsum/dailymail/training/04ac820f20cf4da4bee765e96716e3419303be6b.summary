by @entity0 published : 05:12 est , 16 april 2013 updated : 05:54 est , 16 april 2013 researchers have revealed further ' concrete hints ' of the elusive material called dark matter at an underground laboratory in the @entity6			1
though it is believed to make up a quarter of our universe , dark matter has never been directly observed			1
however , @entity6 researchers working deep inside a mine in @entity13 using an experiment called @entity15 - which stands for @entity15 - say they now have promising results			1
researchers at the @entity15 deep inside a mine in @entity13 dark matter accounts for most of the mass in the @entity21			1
it surrounds galaxies across the universe , and is invisible because it does not reflect light			2
it can not be seen directly with telescopes , but astronomers know it to be out there because of the gravitational effects it has on the matter we can see			1
galaxies , for example , could not rotate the way they do and hold their shape without the presence of dark matter , researchers say			1
the @entity43 says : ' shine a torch in a completely dark room , and you will see only what the torch illuminates			1
' that does not mean that the room around you does not exist			2
' similarly we know dark matter exists but have never observed it directly			1
' the experiment is designed to catch rare interactions when dark matter particles ' bump into ' the nuclei of atoms in a detector that is held at temperatures near that of deep space			1
scientists at the @entity66 reported a @entity67 , or weakly interacting massive particle , signal at a level known as 3 - sigma level , which indicates a 99.8 percent chance they have found dark matter			1
the mysterious substance is believed to hold the cosmos together but to date has never been directly observed			2
' in high - energy physics , a discovery is only claimed at 5 - sigma or better , ' @entity77 high - energy physicist @entity76 said			0
' so this is certainly very exciting , but not fully convincing by the standards			0
' we just need more data to be sure			0
' for now , we have to live with this tantalizing hint of one of the biggest puzzles of our time			0
' notoriously elusive , @entity67 rarely interact with normal matter and therefore are difficult to detect			1
scientists believe they occasionally bounce off atomic nuclei , leaving behind a small amount of energy capable of being tracked by detectors deep underground , particle colliders such as the @entity96 at @entity97 and even instruments in space like the @entity100 ( @entity100 ) mounted on the @entity101 ( @entity101 )			2
the @entity15 experiment , located a half - mile underground at the @entity104 in northern @entity13 and managed by the @entity106 's @entity105 , has been searching for dark matter since 2003			1
the experiment uses very sophisticated detector technology and advanced analysis techniques to enable cryogenically cooled ( almost absolute zero temperature at -460 degrees f ) germanium and silicon targets to search for the rare recoil of dark matter particles			1
the experiment is designed to catch rare interactions when dark matter particles ' bump into ' the nuclei of atoms in a detector that is held at temperatures near that of deep space in the field of particle physics , there is a scale range which is used to determine whether or not a discovery has been made : the five - sigma level of certainty			1
the level relates to the probability that an experiment 's results are down to chance			0
in other words , how likely it is that the scientists were correct , rather than just lucky			0
@entity140 means a 68.3 percent likelihood the results are genuine			0
2 - sigma means 99.449 percent , 3 - sigma means 99.73 percent , 4 - sigma 99.993 percent , 5 - sigma 99.999 percent			0
at 5 - sigma , findings are accepted as discoveries			0
however , researchers admit they have more work to do			2
' we are only 99.8 percent sure , and we want to be 99.9999 percent sure , ' @entity76 said			2
' at 3 - sigma , you have a hint of something			0
at 4 - sigma , you have evidence			0
at 5 - sigma , you have a discovery			0
' in medicine , you can say you are curing 99.8 percent of the cases , and that 's ok			2
' when you say you 've made a fundamental discovery in high - energy physics , you ca n't be wrong			2
' given the money involved -- $ 30 million in this case -- it has to be extremely precise			0
' with a 99.8 percent chance , that means if you repeated the same experiment a few hundred times , there is one chance it can go wrong			2
' we want one out of a million instead			0
' the @entity100 - a kind of particle accelerator and nicknamed the ' space lhc ' in reference to the @entity96 here on @entity177			0
the first results from the instrument on the @entity101 have found a ' glimpse ' of what could be dark matter researchers say the different experiments being carried out around the world - and on the @entity101 - are slowly revealing more about dark matter			1
' we 're actually in a good situation in the whole of the field , ' said @entity191 of the @entity192 , referring to the four types of experiments being used around the world - and within it and below it - to finally track dark matter down			1
' these four ways â€¦ we can rely on to help us work through these hints , ' he told the meeting			0
the new ' recipe for the universe ' : @entity203 's high - precision cosmic microwave background map has allowed scientists to extract the most refined values yet of the @entity21 's ingredients .			0
