@entity0 - the white wine that smells of gooseberries - is @entity2 's favourite plonk , according to new research			1
it pipped @entity4 , our second most popular , in the first ' @entity2 ' wine map , based on the tastes of more than 400,000 drinkers			1
the study of sales data at @entity12 's wine also revealed more champagne bottles are popped in the well heeled @entity14 and @entity15 than anywhere else			1
@entity12 's buyer @entity17 said the @entity18 is a ' nation of wine connoisseurs , with our own unique tastes ' and residents of the seaside resort town of @entity23 , known for its high number of pensioners , like to paint the town red with a glass or two of @entity28 and @entity29			1
meanwhile , @entity30 like to add a bit of sparkle to their lives with the city uncovered as the capital of @entity36 , while @entity37 flies off the shelves in @entity39			2
glasses of @entity41 are sunk in the well heeled @entity14 and @entity15 than anywhere else the analysis of more than a hundred grape varieties and wine regions found @entity0 , made from green grapes , came out on top as the most popular wine in almost every @entity18 town , city and county			1
only @entity52 bucks the trend , drinking more of our second favourite grape , @entity4			0
but the dominance of the two big hitters paints just half the picture because in the last year @entity12 's , the @entity18 's largest home delivery wine merchant , has sold wines made from more than 40 different single grape varieties			0
a closer look at the figures reveals our wine tastes are far more varied and diverse			0
the researchers found @entity66 has the greatest penchant for spicy red grenache , with the highest proportion of bottles sold here			0
trendy @entity71 and @entity72 is keeping @entity73 fashionable , and @entity74 is most at home in @entity76			0
when it comes to sparkling , @entity30 came out on top as the city with the highest percentage of @entity36 drinkers , while unsurprisingly , @entity41 flutes are filling up most frequently in the @entity14 and @entity15			1
@entity29 @entity12 's buyer @entity17 said : ' it is great to be able to draw up the first ' @entity2 ' wine map			2
' what it shows is that , while @entity0 and @entity4 have a huge nationwide appeal , we are actually a nation of wine connoisseurs , with our own unique tastes ' we have seen a slight shift in the nation 's palate over the last few years to wines made from lesser known varieties and from less mainstream regions			2
' wines from @entity106 and @entity107 are becoming more popular than traditional favourites like @entity109 @entity88			0
@entity0 's dominance at the top of that list might soon be challenged			0
