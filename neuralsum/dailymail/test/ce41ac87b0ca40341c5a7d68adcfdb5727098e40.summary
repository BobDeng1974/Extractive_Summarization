@entity0 climbed clear of the @entity2 relegation zone with a remarkable 5 - 3 win at @entity4 as the home side 's alarming slump continued at the @entity7			1
three successive defeats had destroyed @entity4 's hopes of landing the @entity2 title and they had not won at home since january 31 , but the odds were still stacked against visitors @entity0 who knew nothing other than victory would take them out of the bottom three			2
@entity18 might have given @entity4 a sixth - minute lead after combining with @entity20 but the @entity22 side were 2 - 0 ahead inside 13 minutes through @entity23 and @entity24			0
@entity0 's @entity23 celebrates with team mates after scoring against @entity4 in a 5 - 3 away victory @entity28 - @entity27 looks as if he can not believe it as early title contenders @entity4 's season falls apart @entity23 punished his former club with a fine volley after nine minutes following @entity35 's cross and @entity37 's clever back heel into his path			2
four minutes later @entity40 's free - kick saw @entity23 beat @entity41 in the air and @entity44 's powerful header did the rest			0
@entity47 's pace offered @entity4 hope of a comeback as the first half ended and @entity52 's side were level halfway through the second period			0
@entity23 's brother @entity20 halved the deficit with a 59th - minute backheel flick after @entity47 's 35 - metre free - kick had come back off a post and then @entity59 powered home a header eight minutes later from 12 yards			0
both @entity20 ( left ) and @entity23 ( right ) @entity23 scored in the game , but the latter made the difference with a brace the @entity0 players celebrate a famous victory , and it was their first win in a poor run of five games but - a minute later - @entity37 put @entity0 ahead again with a run through the static home defence , only for @entity73 substitute @entity72 to equalise with 14 minutes remaining after racing onto a long ball from @entity75			1
but @entity4 capitulated in the final six minutes as @entity23 scored his second from a fine solo run before @entity78 secured @entity0 's first win in five games after home goalkeeper @entity80 had parried his first effort .			1

@entity0 made it out of the @entity2 relegation zone by beating @entity4
@entity23 scored twice to *outshine* his brother at the @entity7
@entity4 have now lost three games in a *row* to destory their title hopes
