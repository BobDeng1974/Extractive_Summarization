@entity45 , boss of campaign group the @entity47 said : ‘ this is a further sign that the banking industry - and particularly @entity6 - is completely oblivious to public opinion about bonuses and believes the only way to reward employees is through money			1
’ banks on both sides of the @entity57 have been criticised for continuing to award eye watering sums to its staff , despite evidence that the bonus culture encouraged the reckless behaviour which helped to trigger the financial crisis			2
but @entity6 has earned itself the nickname ‘ @entity67 ’ for consistently paying more than its rivals as it has consolidated its position as the most powerful investment bank in the world			1
just before @entity72 it sneaked out details of a £ 367million pay bonanza for its top @entity15 staff for 2013			2

the @entity20 banks are set to announce their pay and bonuses for last year in the coming weeks , but they are likely to be much smaller on average than those awarded at @entity6			0
