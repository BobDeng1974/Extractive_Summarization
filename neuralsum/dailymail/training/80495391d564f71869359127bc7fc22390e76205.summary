by @entity0 published : 10:36 est , 30 july 2013 updated : 10:46 est , 30 july 2013 a vinyl pressing service is mixing the ashes of dead people into records to create a somewhat macabre memento			1
a @entity8 company called ( somewhat appropriately ) and @entity9 put the cremated body parts into raw vinyl that is used to make the discs and turns them into a macabre memento of a person ’s life			1
basic packages cost £ 2,000 for up to 30 discs - far less than the cremation or traditional burial			2
and @entity9 claims that for £ 10,000 you can have your entire funeral planned around the death song			1
if you ca n't choose a song , predetermined backing tracks are available for £ 250 each the hard part is supposedly choosing a record , with some opting for 12 minutes of laughter or songs with puns in the title			1
for those who prefer a ‘ minimal ’ approach , and @entity9 can press the ashes into the vinyl with no song			1
the process involves sprinkling the ash onto a piece of vinyl , known as a puck or biscuit			2
the vinyl is then pressed by plates to create grooves and press the ash into the record			2
and @entity48 was founded by @entity50 music producer @entity49 in 2009 but has seen a surge in interest recently			1

one of his clients was a dj whose family wanted him ' to be played at his favourite clubs a few more times ' after he died @entity49 co-founded the techno group and record label @entity62 in the 1990s and has since founded a number of other labels , including @entity66 , @entity67 and death to @entity69			1

ashes from dead pets can also be used , and are the same fee			2
on the and @entity48 website is says that for £ 10,000 you can have your entire funeral planned around the death song			2
@entity49 was inspired by an @entity80 who put his ashes into fireworks , though others have had them put into gun powder and fired out of shotguns if you ca n’t choose a song predetermined backing tracks are available for £ 250 each , or if you want some bespoke music it costs from £ 500			1
other options include having your record sent to shops around the world to be sold just like any other album			0
if you are still not sure how it all works , the website features a death - like character holding a scythe with a needle head on it , a pair of headphones on his head and a record bag on his shoulder			0
the website states : ‘ please note , despite the light hearted tone , all services are carried out with the utmost respect and care ’			0
surprisingly , putting your ashes into vinyl is far from the most bizarre thing you can do with them			1

space burial company @entity127 will send your ashes into orbit for around £ 1,500 or into deep space for £ 8,000			2
@entity131 guitarist @entity130 once claimed to have snorted a line of his father ’s ashes because he ‘ could n't resist grinding him up with a little bit of blow ’			2
and @entity80 designer @entity141 , who revolutionised the @entity143 , told his children that he wanted his ashes mixed into a batch of the plastic objects			1
when he died in 2002 , his son @entity144 did as he asked and said : ‘ he said he wanted to end up in a frisbee that accidentally lands on someone 's roof			0
’ @entity131 guitarist @entity130 once claimed to have snorted a line of his father 's ashes because he ' could n't resist grinding him up with a little bit of blow ' when you lose a loved one , it is common to keep something belonging to them so you can feel that you have a part of them forever			0
but this has been taken to a whole new level in a craze which sees cremated remains from loved ones turned into ink and used as tattoos			0
using cremation ashes , known as cremains , are being used by more and more people to be injected into their skin			0
@entity170 of @entity172 tattoo parlour in @entity173 , @entity174 , has been doing the commemorative tattoos for 30 years			0
he explains the process , adding that the amount of ashes they actually use is microscopic : ' the preparation is different but it 's the same way we would do any tattoo			0
we sterilize them first in an autoclave as we would the rest of the equipment , and them make sure it 's fine powder and mix it with the ink			0
' but some health and safety experts worry about the practice and that it may be unhygienic or harmful to clients			0
proponents say the ash is made sterile and poses no health risk .			0

' and @entity9 ' mixes cremated ashes into vinyl from £ 250
the idea was developed by music producer @entity49 who as inspired by an @entity80 who put his ashes into fireworks
