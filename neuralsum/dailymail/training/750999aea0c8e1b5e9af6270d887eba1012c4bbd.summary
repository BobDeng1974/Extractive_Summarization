the @entity9 said in the report : ' we noticed in @entity70 in @entity71 , that a fair amount of the top of the building seemed to be an unoccupied spire			2
' ' this prompted us to investigate the increasing trend towards extreme spires and other extensions of tall buildings that do not enclose usable space , and create a new term to describe this - @entity34			0
' the council - which officially determines the height of a building using its @entity48 - go on to explain that @entity55 is classed as the distance between a skyscraper ’s highest living space , and what is considered its architectural top			0

company created report showing the 10 ' vainest ' skyscrapers in the world
each one is called vain because they have a large amount of unused space
this space is used to bolster their height to *achieve* supertall status
skyscrapers in @entity13 waste 19 **%** of space across the city 's skyline
more than *60* **%** of supertall skyscrapers would lose this title if they removed the empty *floors*
