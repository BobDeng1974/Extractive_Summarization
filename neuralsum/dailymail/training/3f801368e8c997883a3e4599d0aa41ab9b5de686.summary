@entity1 's horrendous start as @entity3 manager got even worse on tuesday night as his side were dumped out of the @entity5 by @entity6			1
in one of the most humiliating nights in the club ’s history , @entity3 were thrashed at @entity11 , with @entity12 and @entity13 both scoring twice to seal a stunning victory for the @entity16 team			1
but @entity17 asked supporters for more time , saying : ‘ fans have to believe in our philosophy , we are building a team which we can not make in one month or even one year			2
it ’s very disappointing but i hope they maintain their confidence in our club			0
‘ we have nine injuries and a very young team			2
i have seen them trying to do their best so you can not expect more			0
we made big errors and you ca n’t make these errors as it ’s tough to come back			2
we did n’t have the luck to score but at least we have created a lot of chances			0
’ the night started in a buoyant mood for the travelling fans after @entity3 sealed a @entity58 record £ 59.7million deal for @entity60			1
but @entity3 collapsed in the second - round tie despite having seven internationals in their side and finishing 47 places higher than @entity66 ’s team last season			1
@entity17 sought to play down the drubbing , which saw basic defensive errors lead to the first three goals they conceded			2
behind : @entity3 fans react angrily to going one behind as @entity16 @entity6 celebrate in front of them unbelievable : united players stand shocked after @entity6 scored to make it 2 - 0 he said : ‘ i have no regrets on the team selection			1
do n’t forget we have a young team and nine injuries and we have to play for the second time within 48 hours			2
i could n’t play with the squad i used on sundays so i had to look at the second team and the youth team			2
‘ of course i am disappointed but i can analyse this			0
am i shocked ? no , i am not shocked because i know what can happen and i know @entity6 played very well , very aggressively and they had a bit of luck also with the goals			1
’ united fans were outraged that @entity17 casually signed autographs after the game , but the @entity28 again pleaded with them to have faith in his rebuilding project			1
finish : @entity97 loanee @entity96 ( left ) losts home under pressure from @entity100 for 3 - 0 poor : @entity3 have started the season poorly , with two defeats and a draw he said : ‘ when you start as a manager in the @entity108 with a home loss and then a draw and after that you lose a cup match then it is very disappointing			1
it ’s very difficult for the fans to believe in my philosophy			0
but they have to do that because i am here to build up a new team and that takes time			0
‘ i have n’t just been saying that this week , but last week and even when we were winning everything in the @entity121 on our pre-season tour			0
’ while @entity3 were utterly dejected , the @entity6 were in raptures			1
@entity66 said : ‘ i ’m a bit shocked to be walking off and seeing the scoreline			0
it ’s ridiculous , it ’s something that dreams are made of for these players			0
we work hard and you ’ve seen a youthful energy in the team			0
‘ they ’ve got the superstars in the side and they ’re the ones that are in the public eye on a daily basis , an hourly basis to an extent , we ’re not			0
’ overlooking : @entity36 ( left ) and @entity17 look on from the bench ahead of the game at stadiummk painful : @entity3 's @entity145 goalkeeper @entity144 reacts to going 4 - 0 down with a grimace on his face @entity148 joins @entity151 's @entity150 exodus			1
