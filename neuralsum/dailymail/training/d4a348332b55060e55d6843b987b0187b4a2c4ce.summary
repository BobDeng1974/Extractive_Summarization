witnessing a meteor blaze across the night sky is awe - inspiring			2
so is seeing a comet , nebula or star cluster			2
but what if you could see all of them , at the same time , in the same image of the cosmos ? that ’s the amazing celestial montage apparent in this stunning long - exposure photograph , showing various phenomenon alongside some of their more @entity15 companions			1
use slider below to reveal the space phenomena in the centre of the image is @entity20 , which made its closest pass to @entity22 in january 2015			1
elsewhere a nebula shaped like the state of @entity25 and another surrounding a runaway star are seen			1
move the slider to switch between the annotated and blank image the image , released by the @entity30 ( @entity30 ) , was taken above the @entity31 , on the outskirts of the @entity34 @entity33			1
it was captured by @entity36 during a visit to @entity31 in january 2015			1
using a series of long exposures , he snapped the stunning views of both the observatory and the celestial objects above			0
- a meteor - @entity20 - the @entity46 star cluster - the @entity47 - the @entity48 - the @entity49 - @entity51 airglow in the upper atmosphere - low altitude clouds - @entity31 towards the centre of the night sky in the image is a green object , @entity20			1
formally designated @entity59 , it was discovered by @entity61 astronomer @entity60 and made its closest approach to @entity22 on 7 january			1
on this day it was just 43.6 million miles ( 70.2 million km ) from @entity22 , and was captured in amazing images by astronomers all over the world			1
the comet appears green because its atoms and molecules are ionised and give off a specific wavelength of light - like a neon sign			0
in this instance with the comet , it is due to the molecules cyanogen and diatomic carbon , which both glow green			0
to the naked eye , though , the comet will appear grey ; it is only cameras using a long exposure that bring out its green colouration			0
the comet is of particular interest because it is a ' long period ' comet - one that originates from the outermost reaches of the solar system , the @entity91 cloud			0
to the left of the comet in the image is an unnamed meteor burning up in the atmosphere			1
the @entity30 has revealed this amazing image taken above an observatory in @entity34			1
the montage reveals many different cosmic phenomena above the @entity31 every day about 100 tons of meteoroids , which are fragments of dust and gravel and sometimes even big rocks , enter @entity22 ’s atmosphere			1
when these burn up in the atmosphere they can produce a brief streak of light , which becomes known as a meteor			2
on rare occasions the meteor will make it to @entity22 ’s surface , when it becomes known as a meteorite			1
recently , many scientists have said we should do more to track incoming space rocks , and prevent a potential catastrophe if a big enough rock makes it to the ground			0
in 2011 , for example , a previously unseen meteor passed through the atmosphere and exploded above the @entity127 town of @entity128			2
the resultant shockwave injured hundreds of people and damaged many buildings			0
built and operated by the @entity30 , the @entity31 has several telescopes and is located 93 miles ( 150km ) northeast of @entity134 , on the outskirts of the @entity34 @entity33 formally designated c / 2014 @entity136 , @entity20 ( shown ) was discovered by @entity61 astronomer @entity60 and made its closest approach to @entity22 on 7 january			1
on this day it was just 43.6 million miles ( 70.2 million km ) from @entity22 , and was captured in amazing images by astronomers all over the world in a chance encounter , the image also revealed a meteor burning up in the atmosphere			1
every day about 100 tons of meteoroids , which are fragments of dust and gravel and sometimes even big rocks , enter @entity22 ’s atmosphere just up and to the right of the comet is a very famous star cluster known as the @entity46 , also called @entity155 , and designated @entity156 45 ( @entity46 )			1
at a distance of about 444 light - years , it is the closest star cluster to @entity22 and can even be seen with the naked eye			1
the cluster is predominantly made of middle - aged and extremely luminous stars , which formed within the last 100 million years			0
astronomers have estimated that within 250 million years the cluster will disperse , due to gravitational interactions with the galactic neighbourhood			0
also visible ( long - exposure shot on the left ) is the famous star cluster known as @entity46 , also known as @entity155 , and designated @entity156 45 ( @entity46 )			0
at a distance of about 444 light - years , it is the closest star cluster to @entity22 and can even be seen with the naked eye			1
on the right is a color - composite image of the @entity46 from the @entity173 directly to the right of the comet is a red arc that appears to somewhat resemble the shape of the state of @entity25			1
for that reason this arc , which is actually the nebula @entity47 stretching up to 100 light - years in length , is called the @entity47			0
it is an emission nebula , which means that its gases or most likely lit up by high - energy photons emitted from a nearby hot star - in this case an energetic star called @entity189			2
it is located about 1,000 light - years from @entity22 and is usually very difficult to see in the night sky , except with long - exposure photographs like this			2
in the main image can also be seen a nebula somewhat shaped like the state of @entity25 , left , earning it the name the @entity47			1
on the right is an infrared image of the nebula from @entity201 's @entity200 ( @entity200 ) telescope in the top right of the image is a red blur that is even further from @entity22 , known as @entity49 or the @entity49			1
it is also an emission nebula , which surrounds a blue star known as @entity209			2
the nebula itself is about five light - years across , but it is located 1,500 light - years from @entity22			1
interestingly , the star itself may have once originated near @entity214 , the famous collection of three stars in the constellation of @entity217			0
the star has since been ejected , though , and is now referred to as a runway star			0
this was possibly caused by the collision of two groups of binary stars two million years ago in the nearby @entity225 cluster , which may have caused a supernova that knocked @entity209 into space			0
in the top right of the image , shown left , is a red blur that is 1,500 light - years from @entity22 , known as @entity49 or the @entity49			2
on the right is a separate image of the @entity49 showing the ' smoke ' of reflection nebula the other objects of interest in the image include the green glow seen on the horizon in the distance			2
known as airglow , this results from oxygen atoms becoming ‘ excited ' in the atmosphere , which then emit a green light			0
the atoms extend about 56 to 62 miles ( 90 to 100km ) into the atmosphere			0
in the distance is the @entity48 , which is a network of roads that measures a huge 30,000 miles ( 48,000 kilometres ) in length			0
it links all the mainland nations of the @entity253 , stretching from @entity254 in @entity255 to @entity256 in @entity257 - although the road is not continuous or official in places			0
and , of course , the image is also dominated by the remarkably @entity31 in the foreground			2
built and operated by the @entity30 , the site has several telescopes and is located 93 miles ( 150km ) northeast of @entity134 , on the outskirts of the @entity34 @entity33			1
this is one of the driest and remotest areas of the world , meaning the site is free from light pollution and has fantastic views of the cosmos through a clear atmosphere			0
and , for that reason , even comparatively simple long - exposure images like this are able to unveil many hidden secrets of the universe			0
