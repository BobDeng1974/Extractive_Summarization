by @entity0 published : 11:31 est , 12 april 2012 updated : 18:36 est , 12 april 2012 plunging house prices have triggered a new negative equity crisis , with the @entity4 bearing a far greater burden than the @entity6 , a report revealed yesterday			1
hundreds of thousands more families have become trapped in the nightmare of having a mortgage bigger than the value of their home over the last 18 months			0
the report , from the ratings agency @entity14 ’s , said 3.6 per cent of mortgage - holders were in ‘ negative equity ’ during the spring of 2010			1
by the end of last year , the number had risen to 5.6 per cent			2
but those in the @entity4 are hurting more than those in the @entity6			2
the report ’s author , @entity21 , estimates that about 8.5 per cent of homeowners in the @entity4 are in negative equity , compared with only 3.3 per cent in the @entity6			1
this is because house prices have fallen dramatically in many parts of the @entity4 since the credit crunch struck in 2007 , but have reached record levels in parts of the @entity6			2
official figures from the @entity32 show that the price of the average home in the @entity35 peaked at £ 129,402 in october 2007			0
today it is worth £ 99,385 , a drop of about £ 30,000 , equal to a 23 per cent fall			0
this makes the @entity40 ’s negative equity hotspot with nearly 12 per cent of homebuyers affected			1
by contrast , homeowners in @entity43 have seen their property ’s value reach an all - time high , with an average price of £ 354,300			2
homes such as those pictured in @entity50 are amongst the most expensive in the capital to make matters worse , the number of homeowners who are on the brink of falling into negative equity has also grown rapidly			1
over the same period , the percentage whose mortgage equals 90 per cent or more of the value of their property has jumped from 13.5 per cent to 16.6 per cent			0
in @entity14 ’s research , ‘ the @entity4 ’ is classified as the @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity35 , @entity66 , @entity67 & @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70			0
‘ @entity74 ’ is @entity71 , @entity43 , the @entity72 and the @entity73			0
mr @entity21 said one of the big worries facing homeowners is the struggle to find a new mortgage after the equity in their home has dropped sharply			0
banks and building societies will give their cheapest deals only to homeowners who have a deposit of at least 20 per cent			0
@entity14 ’s does not calculate how many are in negative equity , but the @entity89 ’ latest estimate put the total at around 830,000 , lower than the 1.6million peak in the early 1990s			1
@entity93 , director general of the @entity89 , said negative equity does not necessarily trigger a problem with mortgage repayments .			1
