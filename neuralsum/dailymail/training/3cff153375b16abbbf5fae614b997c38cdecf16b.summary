a foal suffered some of the most horrific wounds ever seen by vets after its owner left a tight head collar on for months			1
@entity6 was just two months old when he was found by animal welfare officers with the head collar sunk into his head on farmland in @entity11			1
the collar had been left on for so long it had become embedded into the foal 's nose , jaw and flesh behind his ears leaving the foal with scarring and damage to his facial bones			1
the @entity40 field officer , @entity39 , who was first called to @entity6 's aid alongside the @entity42 called the pony 's suffering the ' worst kind of neglect			2
' ' no animal should have to suffer in this way , ' he added			0
' @entity6 had to undergo intensive care from vets and the staff at @entity40 - all this is funded by our supporters and without them , we could n't manage , so it 's thanks to them that we 're able to do this work			2
' the collar had been left on for so long it had become embedded into the foal 's nose , jaw and flesh behind his ears leaving the foal with scarring and damage to his facial bones @entity6 had to undergo the surgical removal of the head collar and extensive rehabilitation at @entity40 rescue centre in @entity75 his owner @entity34 , who admitted breaching the @entity36 2006 by leaving the tight collar on , has now been banned from keeping horses for three years ' @entity6 faced what was , to my mind , absolute unnecessary suffering and the worst kind of neglect			1
' after surgical removal of @entity6 's head collar and extensive rehabilitation at @entity40 rescue centre in @entity75 , the young foal has happily now found a new home - just in time for @entity89			1
@entity90 , 22 , had followed the foal 's story in the media and decided to offer @entity6 a fresh start			1
she said : ' i just could n't believe anyone could do this to any animal , let alone a foal			2
' i thought to myself , i can actually give this pony a home - i 've got the means , the space and the land			0
now recovered , the young foal has found a new home - just in time for @entity89 - with @entity90 , 22 , ( left ) who is pictured with @entity40 field officer @entity39 ' the story made my heart bleed so much - i just could n't help offering him a home			1
' it 's so lovely because if i go to the field to catch him , he comes to call			0
considering what he went through , it 's amazing that he still has trust in humans			0
' he did n't deserve to go through such pain			0
it makes me mad that someone could have allowed @entity6 to go through so much trauma when he was so vulnerable			2
' he 's in his new little rug now and he thinks he 's the business			0
' now that he 's in his new home and we 've spent time together he 's not fazed by anything and happily eats at the hay with my three other horses			0
' he 's my little superstar			0
