another was assaulted by @entity2 during a game of ‘ monsters in the dark ’ in which his teacher grabbed him , pulled him onto the bed and groped him			1
and a third complainant was indecently assaulted on multiple occasions when @entity2 got into the shower with him during the trips			1
at court @entity2 tried to argue that he should not be jailed because he suffers from myalgic encephalomyelitis , which is also known as chronic fatigue syndrome			1
@entity2 had maintained he was innocent throughout the entire five day trial , claiming the victims ’ accusations were ‘ fantasy ’			1
judge @entity23 said : ' you suggest that you have been cleverly set up by unscrupulous pupils			2
i utterly and reservedly reject what you say			2
' the court heard that one victim filed a complaint to police in 2000 but no action was taken			0
in 2006 another victim reported the abuse to police and even penned a letter to @entity11 yet no action was taken by police			0
in 2013 the previous complaint of the boy was renewed and the matter was investigated by police			0

the third victim , who had since moved abroad saw a news report in 2013 that a former @entity11 teacher had been arrested			2
despite @entity2 not being named or charged , the victim knew ' instinctively ' that it related to @entity2 and contacted the police			1
judge @entity23 added : ' this is not the @entity18 effect			0
@entity18 died in october 2011 , it was only after his death that allegations began to be made about the sexual misconduct in his lifetime			0
' he added that the victims of @entity2 had made complaints well before the @entity18 case came to light - adding that one had complained nine years prior to @entity18 ’s death			1
judge @entity23 added : ' you believed it had been buried without trace			0
it was and remains beyond comprehension to you			0
' your behaviour 40 years ago came back to haunt you after such an elapsing time			0
the crime has been committed , the perpetrator appears to have got away with it			0
' @entity130 passes , seemingly the matter is forgotten but it has n’t been forgotten			0
' it has n’t been forgotten for one powerful reason , the victims have to live on a day to day basis with the consequences of what you did			0
' he added that the victims had feared that they would n’t be believed and people would not be interested			0
@entity2 , was a physics and maths master at fee - paying @entity11 in @entity12 , @entity13 ( pictured ) when he attacked three boys all aged under 13 he said they had felt ' disempowered ' that nothing had been said or done at the time but that it was common for victims to respond in that way			1
judge @entity23 said : ' three boys complained			2
that is three boys too many			2
' he added that he had admiration for the victims in coming forward but said that it would not diminish the ' enduring pain suffered by the three '			0
as well as being jailed he was also placed on the sex offenders register for life and was made the subject of a @entity163			0
@entity165 , in mitigation , said that @entity2 had been of good character			1
he said : ' there is a serious breach of trust perpetrated by the defendant on young boys in his care			1
' all the good work that he has ever done will be forgotten because of these offences			0
it is a fact he has made a positive and has had a positive effect on many people , not just in the school but in his life			2
' he understands that will be forgotten , for the rest of his life , the 76 years will be as if they counted for nothing at all			2
he will now have to pay the price			0
' @entity185 from @entity186 said : ' i am pleased with the custodial sentence handed down to @entity2 today and i hope it brings some closure to his victims so that they start to move on with their lives			1
