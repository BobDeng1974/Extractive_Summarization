by @entity1 reporter published : 14:29 est , 5 november 2012 @entity3 : 17:45 est , 5 november 2012 @entity4 has quietly released an interview with @entity6 which was filmed one day after the attack on the @entity9 embassy in @entity10 - and in which he refuses to call the incident an act of terrorism			1
the footage , released seven weeks after it was filmed , shows @entity6 contradicting himself yet again on the attack that left the @entity9 ambassador and three other @entity9 dead			1
when exactly @entity6 called the september 11 @entity18 attack in @entity20 ' terrorism ' has become an increasingly contentious area of debate - and the interview throws doubt on the president 's previous and later claims			1
the interview was released this weekend at the second presidential debate in october , @entity6 claimed he had first called the incident an act of terrorism during his @entity40 speech just hours after the attack			1
but the newly - released footage , filmed 12 hours after the @entity40 appearance , shows he was still apprehensive about the label			2
' mr. president , this morning you went out of your way to avoid the use of the word terrorism in connection with the @entity52 , do you believe that this was a terrorism attack ? ' interviewer @entity45 asked in the 60 minutes interview			1
' well it 's too early to tell exactly how this came about , what group was involved , ' he responded			0
' but obviously it was an attack on @entity9			2
and we are going to be working with the @entity20 government to make sure that we bring these folks to justice , one way or the other			0
' attack : the @entity9 @entity66 in @entity10 was set alight and four @entity9 were killed on september 11 @entity45 continued : ' it 's been described as a mob action , but there are reports that they were very heavily armed with grenades , that does n’t sound like your normal demonstration			1
' @entity6 responded : ' as i said , we 're still investigating exactly what happened , i do n’t want to jump the gun on this ... and my suspicion is there are folks involved in this			0
who were looking to target @entity9 from the start			0
' the interview previously aired on october 19 , but this section was edited out , @entity86 reported on @entity89			0
@entity4 only released this footage on sunday - more than seven weeks after the interview			1
the network even failed to offer it up when questions were raised during the presidential debate over whether he had called the attack terrorism before blaming it on rallies against an @entity101 film			2
address : @entity6 is pictured with @entity103 in the @entity40 of the @entity104 the day after the attack butting heads : in the second presidential debate on october 16 , @entity107 said it took @entity6 two weeks before he called the incident an act of terrorism , which @entity6 refuted september 11 attack on @entity9 consulate @entity10 leaves four @entity9 dead september 12 @entity6 addressed nation from the @entity40 : ' no acts of terror will ever shake the resolve of this great nation ' september 12 @entity6 filmed interview with @entity4 and refuses to call attack terrorism september 13 @entity6 speaks at a campaign event in @entity123 : ' no act of terror will dim the light of the values that we proudly shine on the rest of the world ' september 16 @entity131 , the @entity9 ambassador to the @entity132 : ' we do not have information at present that leads us to conclude that this was premeditated ' september 19 @entity136 , director of the @entity137 : the @entity9 ' were killed in the course of a terrorist attack on our embassy ' september 20 @entity104 spokesman @entity142 : ' it is , i think , self - evident that what happened in @entity10 was a terrorist attack ' september 25 @entity6 went on @entity147 and when asked if it was an act of terrorism , responded : ' we 're still doing an investigation ' october 16 at @entity6 said he stood in the @entity40 the day after the attack ' and i told the @entity9 people in the world ... that this was an act of terror ' @entity107 had argued in the debate : ' there were many days that passed before we knew whether this was a spontaneous demonstration or actually whether it was a terrorist attack			1
' and there was no demonstration involved			0
it was a terrorist attack , and it took a long time for that to be told to the @entity9 people			1
' @entity6 responded : ' the day after the attack , governor , i stood in the @entity40 , and i told the @entity9 people and the world that we are going to find out exactly what happened , that this was an act of terror			2
' and the suggestion that anybody in my team , whether the secretary of state , our @entity132 ambassador , anybody on my team would play politics or mislead when we 've lost four of our own , governor , is offensive			0
that 's not what we do			0
' @entity107 fact checked him , adding : ' it took the president 14 days before he called the attack in @entity10 an act of terror			1
' in the debate , moderator @entity194 intervened on @entity6 's behalf , claiming he had called the attack an act of terror in his @entity40 statement			0
in the @entity40 , @entity6 had said : ' no acts of terror will ever shake the resolve of this great nation , alter that character , or eclipse the light of the values that we stand for			0
' while this shows @entity6 had referred to the attack as an act of terror in the @entity40 , the latest @entity4 footage shows that @entity107 was correct about @entity6 's confusion and mixed messages to the public			1
questions now remain over why @entity4 originally released the edited clip that appeared to back up his claims in the debate , but left out the remainder of the interview			1
@entity9 ambassador to @entity20 @entity222 and three other @entity9 citizens came under fire in the six - hour attack , for which @entity18 and @entity227 militia @entity226 have been blamed			0
killed : @entity9 ambassador to @entity20 , @entity222 ( @entity230 ) , and former @entity231 , @entity232 ( r ) , were killed loss : @entity233 , left , and information management officer @entity234 , right , also died in the attack it recently emerged that the @entity9 government was told that the attack had been carried out by militants , not a spontaneous mob , within just 24 hours of its taking place			0
a diplomatic cable sent the day after the raid suggested that militants had previously planned to attack the consulate , and used the excuse of protests against the @entity249 video as a cover			2
it is unclear who , if anyone , saw the cable outside the @entity254 at that point and how high up in the agency the information went , yet the statement directly contradicts the explanation of the attack given by the administration over the following two weeks			2

@entity4 quietly released interview filmed a day after @entity10 attack
in the interview , he refuses to call the incident a terrorist attack
contradicts his previous and later claims he had known it was terrorism
