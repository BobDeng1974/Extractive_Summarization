urging @entity120 around the world to travel to the @entity17 to join the @entity27 state , @entity172 goes on to say : ' @entity175 , because @entity43 is not for the @entity43 and @entity4 is not for the @entity4 '			0

@entity279 loosely defined the state territory as running from northern @entity43 to the @entity4 province of @entity282 - a vast stretch of land straddling the border that is already largely under @entity10 control			1
however a map released later the same day purported to show @entity10 ' ambitious five - year expansion plan - which detailed a desire to control all of the @entity17 and @entity227 , as well as @entity290 and parts of @entity292 in the @entity17 , and @entity232 and eastern @entity231 in the @entity293 .			0
