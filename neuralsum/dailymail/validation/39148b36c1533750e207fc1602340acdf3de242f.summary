it is the game which , ultimately , could define the success or otherwise of @entity2 and @entity3 ’s expensive @entity5 tenure			1
installed amid much fanfare 18 months ago , £ 1million - per - year @entity2 and his assistant @entity3 , with a £ 600,000 salary , were given a remit of qualification for @entity12 , a task made easier by the expansion to a 24 - team format			1
defeat against @entity15 at the @entity16 on sunday evening , however , would all but end hope of automatic progression to the finals in @entity20 , leaving @entity21 to do battle with @entity23 for the play - off berth			1
the mood here is not optimistic			0
@entity2 , manager of the @entity5 , needs to prove his worth with victory over @entity15 @entity2 and @entity3 ( left ) were given big salaries and asked to reach the 2016 @entity31 championships an inquest , you feel , awaits @entity2 and his regime should they fail to beat the group leaders			1
one newspaper described their manager as ‘ bookish and vaguely befuddled ’ , and noted the ‘ carnage ’ which follows @entity3			1
there has been a definite effort to play down the chaos around @entity3 this week and the no 2 gave an untypically subdued and low - key performance in front of the press			1
@entity2 ignored the opinion pieces which have called into question his impact since he arrived and kept all talk to football			1
he said : ‘ the importance of the occasion should not be missed			0
defeat would be a big dent in our hopes of automatic qualification			1
it might not decide everything , but it is very significant			0
we have to try to win			2
if the @entity5 fail to beat @entity15 , their hopes of automatic qualification will be all but over @entity2 and @entity3 take a training session at @entity65 as the team prepare for sunday 's big match ‘ i ’ve said all along that the home games will shape our destiny			1
this is the first of that group			0
we have to make them count			0
‘ we can change all of that ( negative talk ) with one result and one fantastic performance			0
we will not get very far with a pessimistic approach and i ’m not overly concerned with what people say before the game			0
‘ we have given ourselves a chance ( of qualification ) but we will have to be right on top of our game to win this match			1
’ one criticism of @entity2 is that he does not know his preferred xi or , indeed , formation			2
he said this week that players could win a starting place should they impress at their coastal training base in @entity91			2
@entity3 hands out instructions to the @entity5 players during a training session sunday 's game takes place at the @entity16 in @entity97 ; the @entity5 's home ground one player not guaranteed to start is captain @entity100			1
he was dropped for the morale - shattering 1 - 0 defeat in @entity103 in november			2
the @entity105 striker , 34 , said : ‘ that ’s up to the manager ( if i play )			0
‘ i ’ll be ready whether that ’s from the bench or starting			0
i ’m the captain , i have to set an example			0
‘ but i would n’t be here if i did n’t think i could make a difference			0
i still want to be the best			0
’ @entity3 , sensing the air of negativity , added : ‘ it ’s up to us to make this a turning point			2
@entity114 would give this squad and country a huge confidence boost			0
’ lose and it could prove an awfully long three months for @entity2 before they host @entity23			1
win , and that £ 1m salary would look like a shrewd investment .			2

@entity5 face @entity15 at the @entity16 on sunday
failure to win would all but end their hopes of automatic qualification
18 months ago , @entity2 and @entity3 were given £ 1million and £ 600,000 - a - year salaries , and asked to qualify for @entity12
the pair need to prove their worth when they take to the pitch on sunday
