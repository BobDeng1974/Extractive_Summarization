the @entity0 is just nine days away and excitement is building			1
each week our man in @entity4 , @entity2 , brings us the latest news and views from @entity7 - as well as traveller tips for those heading out there - and provides a flavour of exactly how the @entity0 in @entity4 is shaping up			1
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...			0
@entity12 and the rest of the world will have to wait			0
the most expensive central defensive partnership ever assembled will not be on show in @entity17 on tuesday night			2
@entity4 's penultimate @entity0 warm - up against @entity19 will feature @entity20 , @entity22 's latest record - breaker , but club and country captain @entity23 has been left at base to fully shake off a niggle before real battle commences next week			1
@entity22 's money men may have been able to put a price ( Â£ 85million , give or take ) on the @entity31 tandem , even if some sceptics are convinced they have missed a decimal point on the former 's world - record fee			1
but it 's likely that @entity37 would be unable to do similar			1
for him , the duo who make up the beating heart of his defence are utterly priceless			0
central role : @entity42 is the poster boy for @entity4 's hopes at the @entity0 this summer foundations : but @entity37 has built his side on a firm defensive structure no way through : @entity20 and @entity23 have been a major factor in @entity4 's recent success the game against @entity19 will mark the 21st match of @entity37 's second stint at the helm of the @entity4			1
it 's been a pretty successful 18 months in charge for the former @entity0 winner , last summer 's @entity58 victory the undoubted highlight			1
@entity42 is thrust forward as the poster boy of that victory and @entity63 's redesigned national team , but it is his defensive pairing who have been the true starting point , the bedrock for a construction job that the manager hopes will end on july 13 with a second crown			1
a need to blood the previously untested @entity72 coupled with an injury here and there for the captain meant @entity37 has n't been able to pair @entity20 and @entity31 together as much as he 'd like - namely every minute of every game			1
but when he has done so , the results are staggering			0
on @entity37 's watch , @entity4 have a winning percentage of 83.33 percent when @entity20 and @entity31 start together			1
without them , that number plummets to 50 percent			2
they have partnered up 12 times in his 20 games , with 10 wins ( nine of which have come against teams who will feature at the @entity0 ) and two draws			2
throw in their 50 percent rate of clean sheets and their momentous importance is clear			2
fearsome combination : @entity31 and @entity20 have won 10 of their 12 appearances together under @entity37 for @entity4 expectation : @entity37 is under massive pressure to win the @entity0 for @entity4 on home soil ' @entity23 is a great friend , a great player and i get along very well with him , ' said @entity20 this week			1
the younger of the two by two years , he made his debut in 2010 against the @entity102 inevitably alongside @entity23			2
they are indeed friends , but @entity105 are friends , they 're not going to win you a @entity0			1
the narrative that they make for an odd couple may seem like an easy one			0
but it 's also true			2
opposites off the field , they 're very different defenders too			0
and that might just be why it 's worked so well			2
arguably the finest defender at this @entity0 , @entity31 is a supreme reader of a game , his mental strengths , his concentration unparalleled			1
it is specifically in that part of the game that @entity20 has suffered the brain fades that caused @entity126 and others to lose a little trust in him as a last line			1
but he remains technically gifted and one hell of an athlete			0
if @entity20 has one of those ' moments ' ( of which he has had a lot fewer than most critics imply ) , there 's a good chance @entity31 will have seen it coming			1
if @entity23 is technically outfoxed , there 's a good chance @entity20 will be able to scramble and have his partner 's back			1
understanding : @entity31 and @entity20 will become team - mates at @entity22 next season during that relentless run to the @entity58 crown , two @entity145 toddlers by the names of @entity147 and @entity148 became viral sensations , being retweeted from coast to coast and sending social media into a frenzy			1
the problem was almost nobody who saw the image of the two @entity159 - movie adorable kids sitting on the bonnet of a car knew who @entity147 and @entity148 were			2
instead they were told it was a picture of @entity23 and @entity165 as children , not their mini-mes			2
and they lapped it up			0
in that motivational poster font that jumped the shark around the same time as @entity175 , taglines like ' some things never change ' , ' childhood friends are the best friends ' or ' started from the bottom , now we here ' were added			0
the intervening 12 months have seen it pop up on twitter or blogs oh , about every five minutes , as people fall for it all over again			0
apart from the incredible likeness - especially so from @entity184 - the reason it 's fooled so many for so long now is because it kind of just fits			2
watch @entity4 's odd couple do their thing at the back and it 's easy to believe , such is the incredible depth of understanding between them , that they 've doing it since they were both fresh out of nappies and kicking worn - bald leather balls up dusty streets			1
the scary thing is they 've only been doing it for a couple of years			0
they 've just made up for a lot of lost time			0
stand - in : @entity211 defender @entity72 is likely to play alongside @entity20 in @entity31 's absence those who lamented @entity215 's failure to qualify for @entity4 can celebrate last - minute redemption			1
no @entity217 and co are n't going to feature after all but the @entity0 's most famous semi-clad fan is			1
@entity220 became a bit of a global sensation , being labelled the girlfriend of the @entity0 , during the last tournament when she promised to run naked through @entity225 if @entity215 won it all			2
of course they did n't , but in the end the supermodel and actress did it anyway			0
fears that @entity215 's absence may mean her 15 minutes of fame were definitely up were alleviated yesterday though when she confirmed on @entity145 tv that she is on her way			0
' as i always say , there will be a thousand ' @entity241 ' competing for the title , but they can never replace me			0
the others can be lovers , wives , muses , but i 'm the only girlfriend of the @entity0 , ' she said , sounding a bit on the over-possessive side			2
unfortunately for her followers , she is also the girlfriend of an actual human being - @entity250 international @entity249			2
sensation : @entity215 fan @entity220 shot to global fame during the 2010 @entity0 missing out : when @entity215 failed to qualify for the @entity254 there were fears @entity220 would n't attend no fear : but in an interview in @entity4 , @entity220 has confirmed she will be in attendance this summer samba star : @entity220 's decision to grace the @entity0 will undoubtedly please plenty of football fans with organisers upgrading their projected figures for foreign visitors from 600,000 to over 800,000 , @entity4 's domestic clubs must be hoping some of the tourists hang around to take a game or two in after the tournament			1
the cradle for football the host nation may be , but you would n't know it from the desperate state of the domestic game			0
the @entity279 championship takes a break for the duration of the tournament but in the nine rounds that have already taken place , the average attendance comes in just a sliver over 12,000			0
that 's respectable for the upper half of @entity289 's third tier			0
not so much when you 're talking about @entity4 's biggest and brightest			1
' i had spoken with the coach ... they had already got the paperwork ready			0
we had a conversation but nothing that enthused me			0
i never wanted to play for another country			0
' @entity211 defender @entity72 reveals he how he turned down @entity301 's approach in 2009 and in the process gets a sharp dig in at @entity304 , who was clearly ' enthused ' enough by @entity306 's advances to jump ship			0
denial : @entity4 defender @entity72 was not interested in representing @entity301 at international level jibe : @entity72 's comments could be perceived to be targeted at @entity304 who chose @entity306 over @entity4 @entity4 's stadiums are largely good to go - handy that , seeing as the thing kicks off next week - but they will not be mobile - friendly			1
@entity316 is a no - go zone even during @entity145 league games at the likes of the @entity320 or the @entity321			0
so sack the selfies , turn off @entity323 and watch the game			0
it 's a @entity0 after all			1
eyes on the pitch : selfies are popular , as shown by this picture of @entity289 footballers @entity331 , @entity332 and @entity333 but they may not be possible in @entity145 football stadiums due to a lack of @entity316 a whole pile better than in @entity337 , that 's for sure .			0

@entity37 has built his team with a sound defensive structure
@entity20 and @entity23 are the key to @entity4 's *solidity* at the back
the international team - mates will also link up at @entity22 next season
@entity4 win over 80 percent of the time when @entity20 and @entity31 start together
@entity31 to miss @entity0 warm - up game against @entity19 because of injury
