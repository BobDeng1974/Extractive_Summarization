her little sister @entity60 , four , was unharmed and a @entity5 cyclist , father - of - three @entity62 , who is believed to have witnessed the bloodbath , was also shot dead			1
mr @entity64 , 50 , was initially shot once in the forehead as he sat at the wheel of the @entity30 estate car he had used to drive his family to a caravan holiday to @entity12 , in eastern @entity5			2
then a second ‘ coup de grace ’ bullet was apparently used to make sure that mr @entity64 , of @entity73 , @entity74 , was indeed dead			2

’ @entity116 is in an induced coma because of her skull injuries , but is otherwise ‘ stable ’ in intensive care			2
@entity149 , mr @entity64 's accountant , said : ' they were shot through the head so that sounds like a professional killing , which is really very worrying			2
a casual killer would not do that			0
the reason for that – i have n't a clue			2
' intelligence officers from the @entity161 in @entity162 are said to have been at the scene of the murder hours after it happened			0
they were tipped off by contacts in the @entity5 @entity167 as soon as the identity of the car 's owner was confirmed			0

then he saw a cyclist slumped on the ground near his bike , also shot dead			0

she said it was being driven extremely fast by ‘ a man in a black shirt ’ who had to swerve suddenly to avoid hitting her own car			1
@entity40 makes 4x4s in both the 206 and 306 range , leading to the possibility that both witnesses saw the same @entity40 , and it was being used as a getaway car by a man involved in the killings			1
