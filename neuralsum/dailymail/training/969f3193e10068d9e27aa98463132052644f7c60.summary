by @entity0 published : 11:39 est , 14 june 2012 updated : 11:42 est , 14 june 2012 @entity3 's @entity2 squad playing @entity4 tomorrow have been rapped by their country 's prime minister for conducting a bizarre bare - bottomed training session			2
a hugely embarrassing film shows reserve goalkeeper @entity9 on all fours with his shorts lowered , as players fire off shots at his exposed buttocks			1
the team were playing a game called ' the pig ' in which players volley the ball to each other			1
scroll down to watch the video down on all fours : @entity3 's goalkeeper @entity9 kneels down on the ground with his shorts lowered so his fellow players can use his buttocks for target practice rearranging : but after the other players struggle to hit the spot , @entity9 jumps up to reposition himself as ' punishment ' for letting the ball drop , @entity9 was made to get on his hands and knees for the humiliating naked ritual			1
@entity3 were defeated by @entity35 on monday and must beat @entity4 in @entity36 on friday to stand a chance of qualifying for the quarter - finals			2
but instead of a rigorous practice session at their training ground , they were caught playing the oddball game popular in school playgrounds			2
prime minister @entity45 today lashed out at the national team that now has the hopes of the country on its shoulders			0
he told @entity3 's @entity51 newspaper : ' people who carry expectations should be aware of that and act accordingly			0
bracing himself : @entity9 , after turning himself into a slightly easier target , wearily looks behind as his team mates prepare to shoot ready , aim , fire : @entity3 's footballers line up to try and hit the target - @entity63 's bottom ' it 's important to reflect on how what one does in order to meet expectations			1
' @entity69 leader @entity68 described the game as ' tasteless ' , adding to the paper : ' they are really not being good role models			0
' and @entity74 , leader of the @entity75 , said : ' i do not think they should be engaging in these types of games			0
' the head of @entity3 's anti-bullying group friends also told @entity51 : " they have shown unbelievably poor judgment			0
lucky escape : fortunately for @entity86 the ball goes wide of the mark ' tasteless ' : politicians have criticised the naked target practice game - claiming the players are not behaving like ' good role models ' for their young fans ' they are heroes for thousands of boys and girls across @entity3 and i do n't think they should send signals that this is okay			1
' these sorts of games happen at schools and at sports clubs , but there are also children who end up vulnerable in these situations			0
' but the team 's press spokesman @entity104 refused to apologise for the incident , describing it as ' no big deal '			0
he said last night : ' it 's a game the players play in different ways			1
there 's nothing else to it			0
' now watch the video			1
