thug : @entity11 , left , was just 17 when he murdered ' old - fashioned @entity13 ' @entity6 , 88 , right , at her home in @entity9 , @entity10			1
the @entity19 heard he left her to die in her bed , covered in blood the @entity19 heard @entity11 , who had been expelled from six schools and put in a children 's home just six days earlier , went to mrs @entity6 's flat on may 24 with the intention of killing her			1
after fatally wounding her , @entity11 rummaged through her drawers with blood on his hands			1
when a nurse looked through the letterbox and saw him in the room , @entity11 clambered over the balcony and escaped in a car waiting nearby			1
mrs @entity6 's son @entity34 , 55 , from nearby @entity35 , visited with her favourite fish and chip supper just as staff were raising the alarm			1
together he and the care assistants found his mother already dead in her bed , covered in blood			1
known as @entity43 , the well - known former cafe cook had nursing care at the first - floor flat because she had dementia and difficulty walking on her own			1
in the last few years she had been almost entirely confined to her bed			0
in an emotional tribute , her son said she the ' kindest most gentle person ' who was liked by everyone she met			0
the @entity53 sheltered flats in @entity9 , @entity10 , where mrs @entity6 was murdered on may 24 he added : ' i ca n’t believe what has happened			1
' she was a wonderful person and mother			1
she was very straightforward and kind - she had old - fashioned @entity10 values			2
' everywhere she lived she was well - liked			0
the staff at the sheltered accommodation loved her and they have no blame for what happened			0
now i just need to mourn			0
all this is just sinking in			0
' he was not at court , saying it would have been too traumatic to look his mother 's killer in the eye			0
@entity11 even made a reconnaissance trip to the flat the day before the murder , the court heard			1
he conned his way into the building pretending to be the grandson of a resident , then returned to his children 's home in @entity82 , @entity10			2
the next day he gained access in the same way and headed straight to mrs @entity6 's flat			2
detectives identified him on @entity87 and went to the children 's home the same day			0
there they found his clothes covered in blood in a laundry basket , and a bag on his bed which had the pensioner ’s blood on it			2
@entity11 initially denied murder , but changed his plea to guilty on the first day of his trial when faced with overwhelming evidence			1
' although i would clearly love to attend sentencing to see justice done for my mother , i can not , ' he said			0
' if i were to see @entity11 in person , it would make him real to me			2
' he would haunt me and i know those momentary flashes would be unbearable			0
' @entity11 , who turned 18 last month , had previously been granted anonymity because of his age			1
he stared at the floor while he was sentenced , and as he was led away a family member of mrs @entity6 shouted : ' i hope you rot , scum '			2
the court heard social services failed to heed warnings from @entity11 's own father that he was a danger			1
judge @entity120 told him : ' clearly you have significant problems controlling your anger , and it is a tragedy that social services totally failed to have regard to the reality of the extreme danger you posed in may this year and will continue to pose in the future			2
' it is in my judgement , and sadly , a crime at the top end of the scale of gravity			0
' you used a knife to attack a defenceless and vulnerable old lady in the privacy of her own home , on premises you must have seen to be sheltered accommodation			0
' you could have burgled her to her heart 's content without doing what you did			0
' it seems you were observed being driven away in a car but you lack the courage to name your accomplice			0
' you rooted through her property after stabbing her , leaving her blood on her wardrobe			0
' it was wholly gratuitous and , i fear , callous			0
' the court heard @entity11 still faces two outstanding charges of carrying a knife			2
detective chief inspector @entity159 said : ' @entity6 was killed as she lay in her own bed , in a place where she should have been safe			1
to see such violence used against a defenceless , elderly lady was truly shocking			0
' only @entity11 can explain why an attempted burglary had to end in murder			1
' i would like to pay testimony to @entity6 's family who have demonstrated incredible dignity throughout this difficult process			2

@entity11 was 17 when he killed retired cafe cook @entity6
her son @entity34 discovered her covered in blood in @entity9 , @entity10
