@entity0 has been funnelling cash through a limited company , @entity2 , of which his daughter , @entity3 , is a shareholder in a tongue - in - cheek guide to ‘ tax accounting for the rich ’ , @entity0 once advised the wealthy to find a ‘ tax magician with the power to bend the rules , befuddle the tax inspector and make money invisible ’			1
now it seems that the @entity14 star has taken his own advice to heart			0
mr @entity0 appears to have been using his ten - year - old daughter @entity3 to avoid tax payments			1
the presenter of the @entity20 and the tv quiz @entity21 , has been funnelling cash through a limited company , @entity2 , of which she is a shareholder			1
the controversial move will highlight the @entity14 ’s practice of paying some presenters off its books using money from the millions of pounds it earns in licence fee - payers ’ money			1
in 2012 , it emerged that more than 140 @entity14 stars were funnelling cash through private firms to avoid paying millions in tax			1
during the resulting furore , mr @entity0 ran a spoof , ‘ @entity0 ’s six - step guide to tax avoidance for the rich ’ , on his radio show			2
@entity2 had almost £ 810,000 in cash on its books in 2013 – the last accounts available , and £ 1million in 2012			1
if the funds had been paid to mr @entity0 through the pay as you earn scheme used by most firms , it would have been taxed at 40 or 45 per cent			0
but by channelling them through a private firm , he can declare them as company profits , subject to corporation tax of 23 or 24 per cent			0
it is not clear whether these were earnings for mr @entity0 ’s @entity14 work or included other fees such as payments for speeches or book royalties			1
but by arranging his finances in this way , he ensured @entity2 could pay dividends to its shareholders			0
the firm is controlled by mr @entity0 , who has 51 per cent of the shares			0
his wife , @entity70 , has 30 per cent and the remaining 19 per cent is owned by @entity3 , one of their two daughters			0
@entity73 , an accountant at @entity74 , said : ‘ he is obviously using the company to reduce his tax bill			0
it is perfectly legal , and perfectly allowed			0
@entity2 had almost £ 810,000 in cash on its books in 2013 – the last accounts available ' what is a little unusual is his daughter			1
let ’s be honest , she is unlikely to have said , “ @entity84 , i want to spend my pocket money on shares in the company ”			0
’ @entity2 ’ accounts do not disclose how much it has paid out or whether it has paid dividends to all three family members , or just mr @entity0 himself			1
mr @entity73 said mr @entity0 could have named his daughter as a shareholder for ‘ long - term tax - planning ’ purposes , reducing the tax she would pay if she inherits part of the business			1
alternatively , mr @entity0 may have made his wife and daughter shareholders to split the dividend payouts , keeping them just small enough to ensure they are taxed at a lower rate , rather than at 40 or 45 per cent			2
a spokesman for the presenter said the reason for making his daughter a shareholder was ‘ private ’ but ‘ perfectly legal ’ , adding : ‘ i do n’t think it is cynical			2
what @entity0 is doing is very common			0
if the government makes laws that allow people to do things that are advantageous , it is up to the government to change the laws			0
’ @entity14 contracts stipulate that presenters must pay the taxes they owe , and tells @entity119 who it has paid each year			2
a spokesman said it would not comment on mr @entity0 ’s arrangements , adding : ‘ it is the responsibility of self - employed individuals to ensure they are paying the correct amount of tax			2
