she 's long been a fan of sailing , famously beating husband prince @entity3 during a race around @entity5 during the @entity6			1
now @entity7 has announced that the @entity8 has become royal patron of a new sailing charity , @entity11 , which aims to help bring the @entity12 home			1
in a statement released by the palace , the @entity8 spoke of her love of sailing and said she hoped the trust would inspire a new generation to take up the sport			2
“ i feel very fortunate to have enjoyed sailing from a young age and i know it is a great way of providing young people with the opportunity to develop skills and confidence			0
' it is a hugely exciting time for sailing as the @entity41 challenger bids to bring the @entity12 back to @entity41			1
' i am looking forward to being part of this journey and i hope that through @entity11 we can engage and inspire a new generation into sailing along the way			0
' the 1851 trust is the charitable arm of the @entity41 challenger ’s bid to bring the @entity12 back to @entity41 and is supported by @entity52			1
eyes on the prize : with sir @entity56 , she helped launch @entity41 's bid for @entity12 glory leading the charge : sir @entity56 - and team mate @entity60 ( left ) - is spearheading the bid for victory it will work with young people under 25 years old to encourage them to become involved in sailing and the marine industry			1
known affectionately as the ' @entity12 ' , the @entity12 was first offered as a prize by @entity68 in 1851 , who volunteered to present it to the winner of a sailing race around the @entity73			2
after a schooner named @entity75 from @entity76 took the trophy , which was made especially for the race by jewellers @entity80 , the cup was renamed in its honour , and both cup and race have carried the moniker ever since			0
a two - yacht race , the @entity12 is fought between the previous year 's winner - known as the ' defender ' - and a challenger , which is usually the best boat from a series of run - off rounds			2
sailing fan : @entity23 with sir @entity56 during the launch of @entity41 's @entity12 bid in june victory : @entity23 last showed off her sailing skills when she beat prince @entity3 during a trip to @entity5 the real deal : the race took place in two yachts used for @entity103 's own @entity12 bid but while @entity105 might rule the waves in other respects , a @entity41 team is yet to take the trophy which , despite having been won by @entity110 and @entity111 teams in the past , has for the most part been doggedly defended by the @entity113 - among them last year 's winner , @entity116 's @entity115 - throughout its 132 - year history			1
that , however , is something @entity23 of @entity24 and sir @entity56 hope to change , and hope , given enough sponsorship , to assemble a race - winning boat and the sailors to crew it over the next three years			1
sir @entity56 , who is also a patron of the @entity11 , spoke of his excitement about the challenge ahead and what it could mean for the marine industry			1
' we ’re really excited about what the @entity11 can do , ' he said			0
' we are dependent on the oceans and the marine industry needs to become a leader in environmental stewardship , and in finding solutions			0
' young people are the key , there are great opportunities in the marine industry , and we want to open those opportunities up to as many people as possible – the more talent you have working on a problem , the better the solutions will be			0
' it might be named for the new world , but the @entity12 has very @entity41 origins			2
first offered by @entity68 in 1851 , the inaugural @entity12 race was run around the @entity73			0
after a boat from @entity76 named @entity75 triumphed , the cup was renamed and teams from the @entity113 have dominated the winner 's roll call of honour ever since			0
however , all that could be about to change if the @entity8 and sur @entity56 get their way			2
with the 2017 event in their sights , the pair plan to put together and train a winning team and hope to have the cup back in @entity41 within three years .			0
