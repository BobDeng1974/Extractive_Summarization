kill the badgers : ' any future @entity2 government ' would push ahead with ' a wider roll - out of the culls ' , said environment secretary @entity5 environment secretary @entity5 has promised to roll out controversial badger culls across @entity7 if the @entity8 win the election , calling bovine @entity10 the ' greatest threat ' to our food security			1
addressing the @entity16 conference yesterday , she said ' any future @entity2 government ' would push ahead with ' a wider roll - out of the culls ' , which have been fiercely criticised by wildlife groups			1
her comments came as @entity16 president @entity22 said the incidence of @entity10 had decreased on farms in two pilot areas in @entity26 and @entity27 where culling of badgers has taken place over the last two years			1
he urged politicians not to make the controversial cull ' a party political issue ' in the run - up to the general election , and criticised @entity37 for pledging to give up on culling			1
ms @entity5 pledged that any future @entity2 government would ' take the difficult decisions to deal with this disease '			1
she told the conference : ' it is shameful that under the previous government bovine @entity10 increased nine-fold and we ended up with the highest levels of the disease in @entity48			0
it is incredible that they would like to make the same mistake again			0
' she said the government 's strategy included cattle movement controls , vaccination in ' edge ' areas around disease hotspots , and culling where the disease is rife			2
' we will not let up , whatever complaints we get from protest groups			0
we 're in it for the long haul			0
we will not walk away , ' she said to the conference , to applause from farmers			2
speaking to journalists after her speech , she said : ' i 've been very clear we will continue with the 25 - year strategy , and that does envisage a wider roll - out of the culls			1
' while she would not say when the roll - out could take place , mr @entity22 said there was ' no reason ' why - if the @entity2 get back into power and the strategy was still on the table - other areas would not be ready to start culling this year			1
mr @entity22 told delegates at the @entity16 conference that in the two pilot areas @entity10 incidence had already declined , adding that the reductions were ' not just by a small amount either - in the @entity26 pilot area @entity89 on farms has decreased from 34 per cent to 11 per cent compared to two years ago '			1
and he said : ' in @entity27 , vets are also reporting a reduction in @entity10 in cattle too			0
and just two days ago , one of our @entity27 members was given the fantastic news that his farm is now clear of @entity10 , for the first time in 11 years			0
' he is very clear that the only thing that 's changed on his farm is that we are now doing something to control the disease in wildlife			2
' backing : her comments came as @entity16 president @entity22 , right , said @entity10 had decreased on farms in parts of @entity26 and @entity27 where badger culls have taken place over the past two years mr @entity22 also called for the next government to make food and farming a priority , in the face of a report which showed declining self - sufficiency of @entity7 food production			1
research from the @entity16 released ahead of the conference suggested the @entity7 's self - sufficiency is in a 30 - year downward spiral , with 60 per cent of food needs met with produce from farms here			1
at current rates , and with the @entity7 population expected to grow to 70 million in 20 years , the figure could fall to 53 per ent by the 2040s , the @entity16 claimed , warning it would have serious implications for the @entity7 economy , food security and employment			1
in his speech to the conference , mr @entity22 said that in 1984 the @entity7 produced more than 80 per cent of what the country consumed			1
' if you like to look at it this way , our national cupboard lasted us well into autumn			0
by 2013 , the cupboard was bare by august 7			0
if we go on like this we will run out by mid-summer			0
' who would want to lead the country down a path where we produce less than half the food we eat ? this will be totally unacceptable to the @entity7 public and in no way in the national interest			1
' mr @entity22 said polling for the @entity16 showed that 85 per cent of @entity7 people wanted to see supermarkets sell more @entity7 food , and nearly eight out of ten believed the government should do more to ensure a secure and affordable supply of @entity7 food			1
he called for measures to protect farmers from market volatility , including by making sure the food chain worked fairly , better regulation on labelling , preventing ' @entity168 ' using the planning system to stop poultry sheds being built or alternative energy projects going ahead , and to ' sort out the mess ' of reform to the @entity175 subsidy system that attempted to make it ' greener '			2
on the run : the @entity8 say they would continue with their 25 - year tb eradication strategy , which includes a roll - out of the badger cull anti-cull campaigners reacted angrily to ms @entity5 's comments			1
@entity183 , @entity184 / @entity7 's executive director , said : ' the badger cull has been a very expensive , cruel and ineffective farce and @entity5 cuts an increasingly lonely figure in continuing to defend it			1
' she claimed that ' almost unanimous scientific opinion ' described the cull as a failure			0
and she said : ' this cull fails our wildlife by subjecting badgers to inhumane shooting ; it fails farmers by promising a solution to @entity10 that simply does n't work ; and it fails the public by wasting millions of pounds of taxpayers ' money			2
' the rational , scientific and apolitical solution to bovine @entity10 is happening right now in @entity202 : a combination of badger vaccination , improved farm biosecurity and stricter cattle movement measures			0
' with the election just weeks away the government has a short window of opportunity to reverse this disastrous strategy and win back some public trust in its countryside policies			0
' in @entity27 just 274 badgers were culled in the second year of the pilot , falling far short of the minimum 615 estimated to be needed to deliver reductions in @entity10 in livestock , leading the chief vet to admit the benefits of the cull might not be realised there			0
the government claimed the low numbers in @entity27 reflected the ' challenges of extensive unlawful protest and intimidation ' by anti-cull campaigners			0
in @entity26 , where the other pilot cull has been carried out , a sufficient number of badgers were killed this year to lead to expected reductions in @entity10 in cattle , with 341 culled , in a required range of 316 to 785			0
in both of the pilot areas , a significant proportion were killed by the more expensive cage trapping and shooting method , rather than ' controlled shooting ' of free - running badgers			2
ministers and farmers insist culling is necessary to tackle @entity10 , which can be spread from badgers to livestock , with more than 26,000 cattle slaughtered in @entity245 last year and multimillion - pound losses			2
but opponents say badger - culling is inhumane and ineffective , and alternatives such as vaccination should be pursued			2
an independent expert panel concluded that controlled shooting of badgers in the first year of the cull was not effective or humane .			0

@entity5 vowed to extend the scheme in speech to farmers ' union
@entity16 president @entity22 says it must not be ' party political ' issue
he also warns over @entity7 's declining food production self - sufficiency
