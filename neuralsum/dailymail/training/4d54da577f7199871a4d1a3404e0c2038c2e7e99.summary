the @entity5 green sea turtles had their bespoke suits individually designed by a university scientist to assist with his research			2
the baby turtles ' @entity11 ' sun safe ' green vests were made from offcuts from children 's swimsuits after dr @entity16 asked his wife to mock up a couple of prototypes to dress his turtles in			1
dr @entity16 , 55 , said : ' the stunning fluorescent green makes the images so striking but how they came about is quite random			2
' my wife was making ' sun safe ' swimsuits for our eight - year - old twins at the time - and this material was scrap remnants in the cupboard when i went looking for some @entity11			0
' i wanted @entity11 because of is elastic stretching properties			0
' if the swimsuits had been made from a dull brown @entity11 , the turtle vests would have been a dull brown as well - but these are far more appealing			2
' they canny creations are now helping dr @entity16 with his research into the animals a @entity56 being measured			1
biologist dr @entity16 has been studying the effects of nest temperature and global warming on reptiles the study needed a number of snug fit vests to wrap around the turtles and ensure that accurate readings were measured - as well as illustrate the cute costumes created biologist dr @entity16 has been studying the effects of nest temperature and global warming on reptiles - he believes that a rise in temperatures may be leading to the deaths of many newborn turtles			1
together with his team at the @entity77 , @entity16 began research in 2006 to investigate how rising temperatures may influence how strong hatchlings are when they are born			2
they found that warmer nest temperatures not only effect a turtle 's swimming ability but also its sex when born			0
dr @entity16 , 54 , said : ' we were somewhat surprised to find that nest temperature had a larger effect on swimming performance than water temperature			1
' we swam our sea turtle hatchlings in individual tanks , and measured the forward thrust they produced with each swim stroke			0

they found that warmer nest temperatures not only effect a turtle 's swimming ability but also its sex when born ' each hatchling was fitted with a swimming vest and the vest to help measure a hatchling 's swimming performance			0
' if the climate continues to warm as is predicted , and if we want to preserve sea turtle populations at their current level at their current locations , then some sort of active management will need to be implemented			0

@entity127 vests were made from offcuts from children 's swim suits
came after dr @entity16 asked his wife to make the mini tank tops
the prototypes are helping him to carry out research into nest temperature
