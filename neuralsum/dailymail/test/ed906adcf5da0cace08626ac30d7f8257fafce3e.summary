' it is crazy really - seeing as there are three - and - half years between them in age			2
' @entity11 , 35 , had always wanted to have children and decided to store sperm shortly before his testicular cancer treatment at the age of 20 made him infertile			1
he met @entity46 and , after living together for five years , tied the knot in 2011 before embarking on a course of @entity4 treatment			1

after all my treatment , they tested my sperm and they were non-swimmers			2
' i knew then that if i ever wanted to have children i would have to go through @entity4			1
' i had always wanted kids and first went through the process with @entity46 in 2010			2
we got funding for the first try and got lucky when @entity19 was born			1
' @entity28 , now a manager at a filter - making factory , said : ' we then just had to wait and see if it attaches okay			2
we ended up having eight embryos			2
' we put two in to attempt to have a child the first time and froze the other six			0
' we were talking about getting rid of them - as we were paying a yearly storage fee - but decided to try again			0
we had to fund it ourselves this time and put two in again			0
' amazingly they both stuck and we have ended up with two more beautiful babies			0
' i always wanted to have kids and am a big family man			0
the process we went through was hard but we could not have asked more from the final outcome			0
' i am the happiest man ever			0
i have three healthy kids when i thought i would never have any			2
one we thought would be amazing - to have three is an unbelievable gift			2
' what my wife and her body had to go through makes her the real hero to me			0
