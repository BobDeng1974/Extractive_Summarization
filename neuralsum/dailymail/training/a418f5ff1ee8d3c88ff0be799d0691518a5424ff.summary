by @entity0 published : 04:15 est , 24 august 2012 updated : 05:25 est , 24 august 2012 @entity2 's deepest double - dip recession for more than 50 years is not quite as bad as previously feared , official figures have revealed			0
the @entity4 has revised its @entity6 figures upwards , showing a smaller contraction in the economy between april and june this year			1
@entity6 fell 0.5 per cent in three months after a second estimate today , which is better than the initial 0.7 per cent drop that shocked the @entity12 last month			1
the figures show the extra bank holiday for the @entity15 did not have as much of an effect on spending			0
poor : the economy shrank by 0.5 % in quarter two this year , but it is still bad news for the chancellor but despite the upward revision , it still represents the biggest quarter - on - quarter fall for more than three years and means the economy remains mired in the longest double - dip recession since the 1950s			1
smaller than previously thought falls in the production and construction sectors drove the figure higher , while the powerhouse services sector was unrevised , with a 0.1 % fall			1
figures released today showed the @entity2 's trade deficit increased to £ 7.3 billion , up from £ 3.7 billion in the previous quarter as the eurozone debt crisis hit exports - its biggest fall since the third quarter of 2010 , which wiped 1 % off the gdp figure			1
business investment also fell for the first time for more than a year			0
pressure : @entity44 's management of the economy is still be questioned after the revision the economy is now 0.1 per cent smaller than when the @entity48 came to power in 2010 , with national output still 4.3 per cent below the pre-crisis peak of 2008			1
after the @entity54 , by this stage the economy had already surpassed the pre-crash percentage			1
analysts have branded the figures a ‘ disaster ’ and warned that the economy will grow this year by far less than the 0.8 per cent expected by the @entity59 – if at all			2
the improved gdp figures will not to ease the pressure on chancellor @entity44 who came under fresh fire to boost the economy last week when figures showed a shock increase in public sector borrowing in july			2
a spokesman for the @entity59 said : ' @entity2 is dealing with some very deep - rooted problems at home and a very serious debt crisis abroad , and that is why the healing of the economy is proving to be a slow and difficult process			2
' compared to two years ago , the deficit is down , inflation is down , and there are more private sector jobs			0
' the government will continue to give its undivided attention to the economy - for example with recent announcements on infrastructure and lending			2
' the fall in production was revised up from minus 1.3 % to minus 0.9 % , while the @entity4 said construction fell 3.9 % rather than 5.2 % as previously estimated			0
economists believe the extra bank holiday may have knocked as much as 0.5 % off @entity6 , but the @entity4 said it was too early to measure the effect			1
the services sector was not revised higher despite a better than previously thought 0.8 % uplift in retail sales in june			1
in another grim sign for the high street , household spending decreased 0.4 % in the second quarter , despite falling inflation easing the pressure on consumers			0
there are fears that the economy will struggle to pull out of its double - dip recession in the current quarter as the eurozone debt crisis slows global growth			0
@entity111 , chief @entity2 economist at @entity112 , said : ' @entity6 was revised up in @entity113 as expected , but the revision is very small in the big picture and means that output is still more than 4 % below its pre-recession peak			0
' of course , the gdp figures may in the future be revised up further			0
' nonetheless , given the drags from the fiscal squeeze , eurozone crisis and high domestic debt levels , we still doubt that a strong recovery lies ahead			0

previous estimate said it shrank by 0.7 % between april and june , but this was changed to 0.5 % today
the economy is now 0.1 % smaller than when the @entity48 took over in 2010
