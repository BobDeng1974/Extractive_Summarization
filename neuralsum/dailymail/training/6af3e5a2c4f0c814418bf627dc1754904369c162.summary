@entity29 users have branded the image ‘ absurd ’ , ‘ the height of misogyny ’ and ‘ astonishing ’ as the internet responded to what is only the latest proof of the gender gap in the @entity36 nation			0
segregation between men and women in the oil rich country is widespread due to the ultra-conservative @entity45 sharia law			0
restrictions mean they are not allowed to drive , they must use separate entrances at banks and offices , and a plan to build a city for female workers only has been announced			0
restricted : although they are now allowed to ride bikes and motorcycles , women in @entity2 are still very much controlled by their fathers , brothers and husbands they also need permission from a male relative or their husband to work , travel , study or marry and a woman 's testimony counts for less than that of a man in a court of law			2
small steps towards gender equality has been made in the past year			0
earlier this year , @entity72 appointed women to 20 per cent of the 150 - member @entity74 , an unelected body which advises the government			0
