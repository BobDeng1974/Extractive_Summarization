by @entity0 published : 18:07 est , 2 december 2013 @entity2 : 19:47 est , 2 december 2013 spectacular footage of @entity5 's north west desert region has been captured , inadvertently , by a sea eagle that ' stole ' a video camera and took it for a 70 - mile flight			1
the lens recorded the bird 's flapping wings - in sound and vision - the crevasses it flew through , the desert it crossed and finally the amusing moments when it landed and began pecking at the device			1
the motion - sensor camera had been set up by @entity21 rangers in a gorge near the @entity23 last may in the hope of capturing images of fresh - water crocodiles			1
no - one , they agreed , would dare to steal it from croc territory , so they believed it had somehow fallen into the water			1
then , just a few weeks ago , ranger @entity50 and his colleagues received a message from a @entity54 ranger saying a small device had been found near another river more than 70 miles away			2
the video camera revealed the identity of the thief and just where the scoundrel had taken it			2
@entity62 were able to extract three 30 - second clips that showed the juvenile sea eagle scooping up the camera and taking to the air with it , capturing amazing scenes of the @entity5 outback			1
the stolen camera captured the stunning scenery of @entity5 's desert region the curious sea eagle is then seen pecking at the camera after it finally lands after a long flight when the camera was eventually deposited on firm ground , the eagle can be seen approaching the lens and pecking at it			1
' there are 14 of us rangers and we 've been pretty amazed at what we 've seen on the camera , ' said mr @entity50 , a member of the @entity87 tribe			0
' we 've had camera traps moved by animals before , but none of them have taken off - a sort of flying camera			2
it was quite incredible to see it '			0
mr @entity50 told the @entity96 : ' we knew this was a juvenile eagle because the adult sea eagles , once they get their food or their prey , they usually take it right up into the sky and drop it			0
it soon got bored and the camera was eventually found by rangers who then returned it ' but this one was still learning because he just took it near the cliff - side and he never dropped it			2
he just put it down and started pecking at it			0
' an adult one would have flown it right up the top and yeah , for sure , it would have smashed that camera			0
' it wo n't happen again , said mr @entity50			0
he and his colleagues have resolved to bolt their camera down next time .			0
