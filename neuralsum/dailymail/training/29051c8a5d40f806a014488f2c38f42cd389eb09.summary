the @entity0 has condemned the ' horrendous and heartbreaking ' persecution of religious minorities around the world and called on faith leaders to work together to enable religious freedom			1
in a video address played at the @entity8 , the @entity6 spoke of his anguish at the plight of @entity11 in the @entity12 , the region of its birth			1
the heir to the throne also urged faith leaders to ensure believers have respect for other religions instead of remaining ‘ silent ’ over the suffering of minorities			1
describing religion as central to ‘ our future as a free society ’ , he said the ' horrendous ' events in @entity39 and @entity40 had brought the subject of religious persecution ' to the forefront of the world 's news ' - but that it spread far wider			1
he said : ' the horrendous and heart - breaking events in @entity39 and @entity40 have brought the subject of religious freedom and persecution to the forefront of the world 's news			1
' we have learnt with mounting despair of the expulsion of @entity32 , @entity55 and @entity56 from towns and cities that their ancestors have occupied for centuries			2
' sadly , incidents of violence in @entity39 and @entity40 are not isolated			1
they are found throughout some , though not all , of the @entity12 ; in some @entity66 nations ; and in many countries across @entity68			2
' he added : ' it is an indescribable tragedy that @entity11 is now under such threat in the @entity12 – an area where @entity32 have lived for 2,000 years , and across which @entity73 spread in 700 ad , with people of different faiths living together peaceably for centuries			1
' it seems to me that our future as a free society – both here in @entity83 and throughout the world – depends on recognising the crucial role played by people of faith			1
' suggesting ' several tangible courses of action ' , prince @entity27 said faith leaders have a ' responsibility to ensure that people within their own tradition respect people from other faith traditions '			1
he added : ' we have yet to see the full potential of faith communities working together			2
in the video , prince @entity27 describes the work he has undertaken to ' encourage dialogue and greater understanding between different faith traditions ' he said the ' horrendous ' events in @entity39 and @entity40 had brought the subject of religious freedom and persecution ' to the forefront of the world 's news ' but that it spread far wider ' such efforts aimed at peace and mediation are possible			1
the report from @entity115 highlights the example of a @entity117 , a catholic archbishop and a @entity120 minister coming together to form an inter-religious peace group in the @entity122			2
' these seeds of hope can germinate even in nations and regions torn apart by war and violence			0
' he also called on governments to do their best to uphold @entity131 18 of the @entity132 upholding the freedom of religion			0
but he said that this is often challenged , even in the @entity135 , adding : ' sadly , in many other countries , an absence of freedom to determine one 's own faith is woven into the laws and customs of the nation			0
' the @entity6 has become one of the most high - profile names to speak out about the persecution of @entity32			2
last december , he held a reception in @entity148 in response ' to the growing plight of @entity32 threatened by persecution in the @entity12			1
having listened to their concerns , i did my best to highlight the gravity of the crisis			0
' in september he wrote a letter to @entity159 , stating that he was ' heartbroken ' by the situation in @entity39 , and explaining that he had sent a cheque to @entity115 to help their work in the @entity12			1
this winter the charity is launching its biggest ever drive to provide shelter , food and education to 120,000 displaced @entity39 @entity32 in the @entity169 - controlled north of the country			1
the report by @entity115 includes an introduction by dr @entity173 , brother of murdered @entity175 minister for minorities , @entity174			0
the report concludes that of 196 countries in the world , 81 countries – or 41 percent – are identified as places where religious freedom is impaired , either ' high or medium ' , or is in decline			2
of the others , 18 per cent were ' of concern ' and the remaining 41 per cent included ' no concerns '			0
the heir to the throne made the remarks about religious freedom in a recorded video message for the charity @entity115 prince @entity27 's comments come as a @entity11 couple were beaten to death and burned in a brick kiln in @entity175 for allegedly desecrating the @entity196			1
the killing took place in the kiln where the couple worked in the town of @entity202 in eastern @entity204 province , police said			0
the attack is the latest to target minorities in @entity175 for alleged blasphemy			0
under @entity175 's blasphemy laws , anyone accused of insulting @entity73 or the @entity209 can be sentenced to death			0
however , the laws are often used to settle personal scores and target minorities			0
@entity214 , the top elected official in the province , has ordered a probe into the incident			0
' the horrendous and heart - breaking events in @entity39 and @entity40 have brought the subject of religious freedom and persecution to the forefront of the world 's news			1
' we have learnt with mounting despair of the expulsion of @entity32 , @entity55 and @entity56 from towns and cities that their ancestors have occupied for centuries			2
' sadly , incidents of violence in @entity39 and @entity40 are not isolated			1
they are found throughout some , though not all , of the @entity12 ; in some @entity66 nations ; and in many countries across @entity68			2
' thankfully , despite this bleak picture , there are inspirational people of different faiths joining together to overcome division and hatred			2
' it is a well established principle of inter-faith dialogue that we judge each other by the best expressions of our faith , rather than our worst			0
' over several decades , i have been working to encourage dialogue and greater understanding between different faith traditions			1
indeed , last december , i hosted a reception at @entity148 in response to the growing plight of @entity32 threatened by persecution in the @entity12			1
' having listened to their concerns , i did my best to highlight the gravity of the crisis			0
in february , during a visit to the @entity12 , i attended an inter-faith dialogue which included key @entity11 and @entity55 scholars and clergy during which we discussed the @entity11 - @entity55 relationship			1
' it is an indescribable tragedy that @entity11 is now under such threat in the @entity12 , an area where @entity32 have lived for 2,000 years and across which @entity73 spread in @entity272 with people of different faiths living together peaceably for centuries			1
' it seems to me that our future as a free society – both here in @entity83 and throughout the world – depends on recognising the crucial role played by people of faith			2
' and of course religious faith is all the more convincing to those outside the faith when it is expressed with humility and compassion , giving space to others whatever their beliefs			2
' with this in mind i would like to suggest several tangible courses of action which i believe might be helpful			0
' first and foremost , rather than remaining silent , faith leaders have a responsibility it seems to me to ensure people within their own tradition respect people from other faith traditions			1
' we have yet to see the full potential of faith communities working together , however , to do this effectively requires not only maturity in one 's own faith but also in essential humility			0
' i believe that to speak to another faith tradition and to defend those who follow it , it is profoundly helpful to speak from the core of one 's own core spiritual experience			0
' my own @entity11 faith has enabled me to speak to and to listen to people from other traditions including @entity73 and , as @entity323 has recently said , such interfaith dialogue is a necessary condition for peace in the world and should be seen as a duty for all @entity32 , as well as for believers from other religious communities			1
' such efforts aimed at peace and mediation are possible			0
the report from @entity115 highlights the example of a @entity117 , a catholic archbishop and a @entity120 minister coming together to form an inter-religious peace group in the @entity122			0
' these seeds of hope can germinate even in nations and regions torn apart by war and violence			0
' secondly it is essential that governments honour their duty to uphold the right of people to practice their faith			0
' @entity131 of the @entity132 is clear in stating this right includes the right to change one 's religion or belief			0
yet even in the west this right is often challenge ' sadly , in many other countries , an absence of freedom to determine one 's own faith is woven into the laws and customs of the nation			0
