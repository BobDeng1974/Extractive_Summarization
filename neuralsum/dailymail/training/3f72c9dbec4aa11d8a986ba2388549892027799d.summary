by @entity0 last updated at 2:44 pm on 28th september 2011 a painkiller taken by millions can increase the risk of heart attack and stroke by 40 per cent , a study has found			1
researchers say that while there is no need for patients to panic , diclofenac should be restricted to prescription only			0
in completely healthy patients , a 40 per cent raised chance of heart problems is not at all significant			1
but for those who already have a high risk of a heart attack or stroke , taking the painkiller could present serious problems			1
researchers say that while there is no need for patients to panic , diclofenac should be restricted to prescription only			0
the drug is given to 6million patients last night the @entity29 ( @entity29 ) said that patients should not stop taking the drug , but should consult their doctor if they have fears over its safety			2
last year almost 17million prescriptions were written by @entity36 in @entity37 for non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs , or @entity39 , for conditions such as arthritis , back pain , gout , headaches and fever			0
of these , diclofenac was the most commonly prescribed and given to 6million patients			0
it can also be bought over-the - counter under the brand name @entity49 for around £ 6			1
it is at lower strength but still carries a 22 per cent higher risk			1
dr @entity53 of @entity54 , who led the landmark review of studies looking at nearly 3million people , said : ‘ @entity59 on prescription was associated with an increase in cardiovascular risk of 40 per cent			1
‘ people take it because it ’s effective , but it ’s very important for patients and doctors to know the risks associated with these drugs for high - risk patients			1
the painkiller can also be bought over the counter under the brand name @entity49 for around £ 6			1
it is at lower strength but still carries a 22 per cent higher risk ‘ it is now available over the counter , and our study suggests there is a case for looking at that again and making it prescription - only as well as strengthening advice to doctors and patients about how it should be used			1
‘ there is a very clear increase in risk as the dose goes up , which says to people who perhaps ca n’t get out of bed due to arthritis and take diclofenac , take a different drug instead and you might be at a lower risk of heart attack and stroke			1
‘ we have reviewed all the previous studies and are confident that the results are robust enough to inform clinical and regulatory decisions			0
’ this is the first study to measure the relative risks of different drugs , and it found that ibuprofen and naproxen had the lowest risk of cardiovascular problems			1
many patients were transferred to diclofenac from @entity113 , the painkiller which was withdrawn by manufacturer @entity115 in 2004 after it was linked to heart attacks and strokes			0
many patients were transferred to diclofenac from @entity113 , the painkiller which was withdrawn by manufacturer @entity115 in 2004 after it was linked to heart attacks and strokes patients will often be at minimal risk			2
for a young woman , the risk of having a heart attack will be around 0.1 per cent and a 40 per cent rise is still just 0.14 per cent			1
however for a pensioner who has already had one heart attack , a 40 per cent increase could be significant			2
@entity130 of the @entity131 said : ‘ the potential risks for heart patients taking certain painkillers have been known for some time and these findings should n’t be ignored			0
but scientists and drug regulators will need to delve deeper before we draw any firm conclusions			2
‘ as with any medicine there are benefits and potential risks to taking painkillers			0
if you ’re already taking these types of drugs and are worried , do n’t simply give up on your medication			0
you should always speak to your doctor first because the benefits may well outweigh the risks for you			0
’ a spokesman for the @entity29 said : ‘ our priority is to ensure that the benefits of medication outweigh the risks			0
@entity39 treatment is associated with a small increased risk of heart attacks and stroke			2
the risk is higher with long - term treatment			2
‘ @entity163 warnings about the risk of gastro - intestinal and heart problems , along with information about those patient groups in which nsaids either should not be used , such as those with severe heart failure , or only used with caution , are contained in the product information including the patient information leaflet that accompanies the medicine			1
‘ to minimise the risk of side effects , all @entity39 should be used at the lowest possible dose for the shortest period necessary to control symptoms			2
‘ people should not stop taking their @entity39 medicine , but if they have any questions or concerns about their treatment they should speak to their doctor			0
‘ the @entity29 keeps the safety of nsaids under close review and any new data will be carefully evaluated			0
’ a spokesman for @entity190 , which makes @entity59 , said : ‘ in our view , this analysis , in the context of the vast clinical experience worldwide , does not change the favourable benefit - to - risk assessment for diclofenac when used as directed			1
‘ @entity190 is confident about the safety profile of diclofenac products			0

@entity59 can raise risk by 40 per cent
drug is found in @entity49 *tablets* - where risk is increased by 22 per cent
risk *greatest* for those already suffering problems
