' she added : ' it 's very bizarre and it 's a very twisted and confusing scenario			0
' it was n't until she was contacted by a @entity53 reporter investigating @entity12 that she found out the truth			1
she told @entity44 : ' in the past five years , [ @entity30 has ] literally been stalking my facebook and stealing my photos			1

' in another twist , @entity81 was drawn into the scam despite saying she has ' strong experience ' with internet advertising and is professionally competent with social media			0

@entity97 said that @entity81 was a ' good person ' from a ' good family			0
' innocent : @entity10 was apparently unsuspecting of the scam - and was ' shocked ' to find her face as that of @entity103 inspiration : @entity5 used the memory of @entity12 to drove him to victory and create a myth that captivated the nation but any role he may have had in the hoax is now questioned @entity5 's tragic story about his girlfriend won his a groundswell of public support last september as @entity14 was heading into crunch games for the @entity117 championships			1

' all the other photos used on @entity39 's @entity74 account came from the private @entity20 and @entity21 accounts belonging to @entity10 , apart from one , which she unwittingly sent to former high - school classmate @entity144			2
shocked : friends of @entity10 say she only found out yesterday she was the most famous woman in @entity147 right now according to @entity53 , @entity30 got in touch with her out of the blue some time ago with a rather convoluted story			1
he said his cousin had been hurt in a car crash and that he wanted to get her show support by sending her pictures of people he knew holding up a sign saying ' @entity157 , ' which he planned to show her as a slide show			0
