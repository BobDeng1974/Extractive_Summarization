a full judicial inquiry may be needed to get to the bottom of claims @entity5 spies were complicit in the torture of terror suspects in @entity9 jails , @entity0 said today			1
the deputy prime minister said torture ‘ can not , will not and is not being used under any circumstances by @entity5 agencies ' today			1
but the publication of a damning report into @entity9 interrogation techniques yesterday has sparked accusations that the @entity18 was was operating a ' secret policy of complicity ' after 9/11			1
he said this included ' allowing people initially under our control to be taken and subjected to torture '			2
@entity34 raged on both sides of the @entity36 as politicians absorbed the enormity of the report by the @entity40 , which said the use of torture by the @entity9 was far worse than feared and a ' stain on the conscience ' of the @entity27			1
some 119 detainees were subjected to beatings , waterboarding , rectal feeding , being hung on chains and being made to wear nappies at a network of secret jails			1
one detainee , chained half - naked to a floor , died of hypothermia			1
the @entity5 security services and @entity18 were being fed information by the @entity9 and worked closely with the @entity59 administration on the ' war on terror '			2
yet the 499 - page @entity40 report did not contain a single reference to @entity63 , @entity64 or @entity65 , a @entity5 overseas base known to have been used for rendition – prompting claims it had been redacted to spare the @entity5 's blushes			1
amid the fallout from the @entity27 @entity40 's explosive report into the barbaric techniques used by the @entity9 , ex-shadow home secretary @entity25 said the @entity5 had ' turned a blind eye ' to what @entity27 was doing the @entity5 security services and @entity18 were being fed information by the @entity9 and worked closely with the @entity59 administration on the ' war on terror '			1
yet the 499 - page @entity40 report did not contain a single reference to @entity63 , @entity64 or @entity65 , a @entity5 overseas base known to have been used for rendition – prompting claims it had been redacted to spare the @entity5 's blushes			1
over two years , the @entity5 ambassador in @entity84 , sir @entity85 , met with members of the committee at least 11 times			2
his predecessor , @entity89 , also held 11 meetings with members of the committee between 2009 and 2011			0
ex-foreign secretary @entity92 also made ' representations ' to the @entity27			0
an inquiry by judge sir @entity95 was halted pending police inquiries but raised 27 areas requiring further investigation , ranging from interrogation techniques to so - called ‘ rendition flights ’ , the training of agents and ministerial oversight of the agencies			2
they are now being examined by the parliamentary @entity106 ( @entity106 ) - a move which campaigners argue is insufficiently independent			0
mr @entity0 said during his weekly @entity110 phone - in : ‘ once the police investigations are done , once the report from the @entity106 is done , we should keep an open mind if we need to about moving to a full judicial inquiry if there are any outstanding questions			1
‘ i 'm like anybody else : i want the truth out there			0
’ he went on : ‘ however shocking the @entity40 committee report is , it 's worth remembering that i doubt very much any state run by @entity123 would ever have the maturity to lift the lid on its own mistakes in the way a mature democracy like @entity27 has done			2
’ mr @entity0 said the @entity40 committee report included the ‘ devastating assertion that it ( torture ) did n't actually keep us safe ’ and may in fact have led to resources being wasted on false trails			1
prime minister @entity135 has declared himself ‘ satisfied that our system is dealing with all these issues ’			0
campaign groups want @entity139 and ex-new @entity141 ministers to be grilled , too			2
chairman sir @entity142 said : ' there is an important issue that needs to be addressed			0
it 's not whether the @entity5 government or @entity5 agencies were carrying out torture			1
' it 's whether the intelligence agencies benefited from information or accepted information that they either knew or ought to have known had been obtained through improper means			0
' but human rights groups are adamant that a full judge - led inquiry must take place to get to the truth			1
they also want the full 6,000 - page version of the @entity40 report to be released , not just the heavily - redacted summary			1
ex-shadow home secretary @entity25 ( left ) said the @entity5 had ' turned a blind eye ' to what @entity27 was doing , while sir @entity142 ( right ) said whether intelligence agencies benefited from information they knew had been obtained through improper mean was ' an important issue that needs to be addressed ' @entity169 defended his brother @entity170 's record as foreign secretary @entity169 today defended his brother 's record as foreign secretary amid growing questions over what the last @entity141 government knew about @entity27 torture techniques			1
the @entity141 leader was asked whether @entity170 had questions to answer about what he knew when he served in the @entity182 under @entity139 and @entity183			2
mr @entity169 said : ' he has talked about these things in the past			0
' i know how seriously he took these issues when he was in government			0
' he answered questions about this in the @entity191 while he was in government			0
' the @entity141 leader added : ' he is never somebody who would ever countenance the @entity5 state getting engaged in this kind of activity			0
' the government itself here in @entity5 previously announced an inquiry into these issues but then held off that inquiry because there are court cases ongoing			2
i think it ’s right to let those court cases and those issues take their course			0
' @entity207 is now head of the @entity209 aid organisation in @entity210			0
@entity211 , of @entity212 , said : ' we already know the @entity5 was up to its neck in the @entity9 's rendition and torture programme			1
yet the @entity5 government continues to fight against real accountability in the @entity5 courts			2
' @entity220 said it was clear ' the @entity9 did not act alone ' and called for the full report to be published			2
former foreign secretary @entity223 said : ' i was never in any way complicit in the unlawful rendition or detention of individuals by the @entity27 or any other state			0
' former home secretary @entity230 declined to comment			0
former @entity232 detainee @entity231 – who was paid compensation by the @entity5 for alleged complicity in his ill - treatment – said there was a link between the torture report and the slaughter of @entity5 and @entity27 hostages in @entity241			1
he said terror group @entity242 was ' born out of the dungeons of @entity245 , where these torture methods were being implemented '			0
islamic extremists last night vowed to kill those responsible for the torture revealed in the @entity9 report			1
@entity251 wrote on @entity252 : ' you thought things can not get any worse for @entity27			0
these # torturereports are going to radicalise a whole generation			0
' he added : ' @entity260 the bastards who are defending the @entity9 and justifying their actions			0

@entity0 said torture ' can not , will not and is not being used ' by @entity5 agencies
