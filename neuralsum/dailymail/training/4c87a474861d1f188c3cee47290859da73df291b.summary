by @entity1 reporter published : 11:04 est , 21 june 2012 updated : 04:18 est , 22 june 2012 a schoolgirl has to eat olive oil with everything - otherwise she could suffer from life - threatening seizures			1
light - weight @entity6 , nine , has a rare , incurable genetic condition , which means her brain ca n't receive enough nourishment from a normal diet			1
as a result she must consume three times as much fat as her friends and drink as much double cream or olive oil in one meal as an adult would consume in a day			1
@entity6 manages to attend school and live a normal life , but her devoted mum @entity21 and dad @entity22 , both 44 , have to closely monitor her 1,482 calorie , six meal - a - day diet			1
@entity6 has a diet rich in double cream and fat and is pictured with some of her usual daily fare there are only 25 people diagnosed with the condition , known as ' glut1 deficiency syndrome ' , in the @entity33 , with 100 sufferers in the world			1
mrs @entity6 said : ' @entity36 is the complete opposite of feeding a normal child			1
' parents are constantly being told to cut down their child ’s diet to reduce the amount of fat			0
' but for @entity6 that ’s exactly what she needs because it ’s the fat that ’s feeding her brain			1
' she ’s a thin little thing too , she weighs the same as any other nine year old girl			0
' @entity6 suffered her first seizure at just eight weeks old and endured a second just four months later			2
@entity21 noticed the seizures hit just as @entity6 was being fed and that her young daughter was constantly lethargic			2
the worried parents , who live in @entity56 , @entity57 , took @entity6 to several doctors , but they were baffled due to the rarity of the condition			1
@entity6 was at first misdiagnosed with ataxic cerebral palsy because of a lack of balance and unexplained tiredness			2
@entity21 said : ' we kept saying something was n’t right			0
@entity6 suffered her first seizure when she was eight weeks old and then when she was three months old i was feeding her baby food and she had another one , so we knew it had to be something relating to food			2
' she was fighting for energy all the time - we did n’t know it was because we were giving her the wrong kind of foods			0
' @entity6 was finally diagnosed at the age of seven following a lumbar puncture at @entity79 in @entity80			2
the condition , which is caused by a faulty gene passed down from one of her parents , means @entity6 ca n’t transport glucose into her brain efficiently , leaving her starved of energy			1
since her diagnosis and high - fat diet @entity6 has not suffered a single seizure			1
@entity6 holds a bottle of olive oil , which she pours over her meals every day , and drinks a glass of double cream @entity21 and @entity22 , whose 13 - year - old daughter @entity96 is n’t affected by the condition , have now spoken out to warn other parents			1
@entity22 , who works as an instrument engineer for @entity100 , added : ' @entity6 has to have three times as much fat in her diet as she does carbohydrates and protein			1
' she takes a lot of things like triple cream , oils and fatty meats			0
' it ’s difficult for her but she handles the condition really well			0
if one of her school friends offers her some chocolate , which she loves but she ca n’t have because it contains too much sugar , she says no because she knows she could have a seizure			0
' we do n’t know why she has been affected by this faulty gene			0
our other daughter is perfectly fine			0
' we have to be very incredible careful , we have a massive pair of scales in the kitchen because we have to measure everything			0
' the problem for doctors at the beginning was , because the condition is so rare , they did n’t know what to look for but since her diagnoses they have been fantastic			2
' we have to give @entity6 extra olive oil with everything			1
if she has soup we have to top it up with oil , if she has bacon we have to add extra oil , but she seems to be used to it			0
i tried it once and i could n’t handle it			0
' @entity6 will probably have to stay on the diet for the rest of her life unless a drug is developed that can manage it			2
' we just want other parents to be aware of this condition in case their child has it			0
having the right diet really can make a difference			0

@entity6 consumes huge portions of pizza , double cream and olive oil
her rare condition means her brain is starved on energy on a normal diet
