by @entity0 published : 17:48 est , 23 june 2013 updated : 09:45 est , 24 june 2013 a-list actor @entity1 has put his ethics ahead of his career by refusing to promote the second @entity5 film , saying he can not support that level of violence			1
the star of @entity9 and @entity10 made the decision to pull out of the film 's media promotions in the wake of the @entity15 shooting last december			1
the 51 - year - old stars as colonel @entity17 in the r - rated film , a vicious ex-mafia member turned crime fighter who leads a team of other heroes			1
the violent nature of the film seems to have left a mark on the @entity28 , who is a staunch gun control advocate , and according to his personal tweets he will now no longer be promoting the film on principle			2
@entity34 to watch trailer menacing : he plays a violent ex-mafia member in @entity37 but on anti-violence principles has pulled out from promoting the film the grandfather - of - one wrote on @entity41 : ' i did kickass a month b4 @entity15 and now in all good conscience i can not support that level of violence			1
' he added a few minutes later : ' i meant to say my apologies to others involved with the film			0
i am not ashamed of it but recent events have caused a change in my heart			0
' the movie will be released in the @entity56 and the @entity57 on 16 august			0
big pay day : @entity1 has announced he will not promote @entity37 due to the film 's violent content twit : the movie star made his proclamations on the social media website on sunday @entity65 , creator of the original comic book and the film 's executive producer said he was ' baffled ' by @entity1 's decision and asked him to reconsider			1
' i can not support that level of violence ' : @entity1 said @entity15 shootings made him think twice about content of @entity37 in a forum on his website @entity77 , he wrote : ' as you may know , @entity1 is a passionate advocate of gun - control and i respect both his politics and his opinion , but i 'm baffled by this sudden announcement as nothing seen in this picture was n't in the screenplay eighteen months ago			1
' yes , the body - count is very high , but a movie called @entity37 really has to do what it says on the tin			1
' a sequel to the picture that gave us @entity93 was always going to have some blood on the floor and this should have been no shock to a guy who enjoyed the first movie so much ... like @entity1 , i 'm horrified by real - life violence ( even though i 'm @entity99 ) , but @entity37 is n't a documentary			1
' he added : ' ultimately , this is his decision , but i 've never quite bought the notion that violence in fiction leads to violence in real - life any more than @entity108 casting a spell creates more boy @entity110 in real life. , , @entity1 , i love ya and i hope you reconsider for all the above points			1
' @entity116 , the film 's studio , has yet to comment on @entity1 's decision			1
principal photography began on september 7 2012 in @entity28 , before moving to @entity120 , with the shooting eventually finishing on november 23 , 2012			2
just a couple of weeks later , the @entity15 tragedy , in which 28 people in total were killed by gunman @entity126 , happened			2
fans of the actor seemed split on his proclamation , with one saying , ' can you explain more ? you 're basically saying you do n't indorse ( sic ) kick ass even though you 're a big part of it ? seems strange to me			0
' another added , ' it 's a movie			0
a fun , violent movie			0
if there was no violence on tv there might be more in real life , ' with some even calling on him to give away his salary to prove his sincerity			0
however others supported his stance , with one saying : ' very brave to come out with that , i hope you get that support form the film industry , most are good understanding people			0
' as well as being a stanch gun control activist , @entity1 is also a anti-vaccination campaigner , and has previously claimed $ 10m paycheque he received for his role in @entity159 proves the validity of @entity161			2
the script for the first @entity5 film was written by @entity165 , the wife of @entity56 chat show host @entity166 , however , she did not return for the second instalment			0
@entity37 , which features a new group of villains hellbent on tackling the titular character , is released in the @entity56 on august 14 and the @entity57 two days later			0
the violent nature of the film seems to have left a mark on the @entity28 , pictured left last year at the @entity175 , and right in 2008 at the @entity176 premier , who will now no longer be promoting the film no support : despite being a top - of - the - bill star featured on the poster it seems he will not promote it			2
