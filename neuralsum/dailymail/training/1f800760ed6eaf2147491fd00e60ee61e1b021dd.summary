the @entity0 managed a wide - ranging program that singled out tea party groups for special scrutiny from its headquarters in @entity5 , according to bombshell documents released wednesday by a watchdog organization			1
@entity8 , a center - right group that specializes in @entity10 document requests and lawsuits , said it received a cache of papers from the @entity0 showing the depth of the @entity17 administration 's involvement in what officials have previously called the work of a few ' rogue agents ' in @entity22 , @entity23			1
and letters from @entity26 sen. @entity25 , a @entity28 @entity27 , show his involvement in pressing the @entity0 to target mostly conservative organizations with cumbersome questionnaires seemingly calculated to slow down their applications for tax - exempt status in the middle of an election year			1
in one july 2010 email among @entity0 managers , a lawyer with the @entity39 in @entity5 wrote that his office was ' working the @entity42 applications in coordination with @entity22			1
' former @entity0 official @entity44 has been found in contempt of @entity46 for refusing to testify about the tea party targeting scheme , and her fingerprints are on some of the newly released emails @entity42 - linked conservative groups have turned their unfair treatment by the @entity0 into a national rallying cry , forcing the @entity17 @entity54 and congressional democrats to address the deepening scandal ' we are developing a few applications here in @entity5 and providing copies of our development letters with the agent to use as examples in the development of their cases , ' wrote government attorney @entity66			1
he acknowledged that the flood of tax - exemption applications from tea party groups were considered part of a ' @entity72 ' project , meaning that the @entity0 ' can not resolve any of the cases without coordinating with @entity74 [ @entity75 ] ' – who was then in charge of @entity0 ' rulings and agreements ' in the agency 's @entity5 headquarters			1
tax - exempt status allows social welfare groups to raise money without paying federal income taxes			0
the privilege is a highly sought - after perk among nonprofit campaign groups , including many that advocate political positions without endorsing candidates directly			2
such ' electioneering ' is strictly prohibited			0
beginning in early 2010 , less than a year before the midterm congressional elections that would see the tea party flex its biggest political muscles , the @entity0 slow - walked hundreds of the groups ' applications for as many as three years , hampering their ability to communicate publicly and advocate positions on issues			1
most liberal groups applying for the same status were swiftly approved , including one application from president @entity17 's half - brother , whose application was back - dated so he could claim tax advantages retroactively for a foundation he had set up in the name of their common father			0
@entity44 , who led the @entity0 's @entity39 division while the scheme was in place , retired in late 2013 – but not before assuring her own agency that no one in her division had developed the criteria that determined which conservative groups were targeted for special scrutiny			1
on april 2 , 2013 , she emailed @entity0 investigators about a ' @entity121 ' ( @entity123 ) list that was circulated agency - wide			1
that list , she claimed , ' only contained a brief reference to " organizations involved with the @entity127 movement "			0
' she also suggested that government employees in her @entity22 subagency were not actively looking for ways to ' label cases as " tea party ” cases , ' but had rules to follow			2
' do the applications specify / state " tea party " ? ' she said one manager inquired about the proper yardstick to use			2
' if not , how do we know [ the ] applicant is involved with the tea party movement ? ' employees of one ' screening group manager ' in @entity22 , she said , reported that groups with ' @entity127 , ' ' @entity145 ' or ’ @entity147 ’ in their names qualified , along with groups that advocated against ' government spending , government debt and taxes , ' those that would ' [ e ] ducate the public through advocacy / legislative activities to make @entity26 a better place to live , ' and those whose case files included statements ' that are critical of the how the country is being run			1
' that , however , runs counter to @entity66 's claim that managers in @entity5 – not those in @entity22 – were using test - cases to ' develop ' the lengthy set of questions that tea party groups would later characterize as a deluge of harassment			1
the @entity0 is facing new levels of scrutiny and conservative outrage with the revelation of new emails showing that a program targeting tea party groups for special scrutiny was managed in @entity5 some items on multi-page questionnaires demanded the names of volunteers , membership lists , exhaustive archives from @entity188 and @entity189 , and even the identities of underage recipients of mentoring			1
other emails show that she later asked the @entity26 @entity195 about the possibility of criminally prosecuting tax - exempt groups , notably those on the political right			2
@entity8 obtained the latest treasure trove of paperwork in an october 2013 lawsuit after the agency refused to turn over the documents four times earlier that year			0
' these new documents show that officials in the @entity0 headquarters were responsible for the illegal delays of @entity127 applications , ' @entity8 president @entity206 said wednesday in a statement			2
' it is disturbing to see @entity44 mislead the @entity0 ’ internal investigators about her office ’s @entity127 targeting			2
these documents also confirm the unprecedented pressure from congressional @entity217 to go after president @entity17 ’s political opponents			0
' ' the @entity0 scandal has now ensnared @entity46 , ' he said			0
@entity28 @entity217 senator @entity25 wrote to the @entity0 repeatedly in the months preceding the 2012 presidential election , trying to muscle the agency into tightening its leash on conservative nonprofit advocacy groups that claim is a reference to a series of letters from sen. @entity25 , a @entity28 @entity27 who wrote to the @entity0 in june 2012 to complain about 12 nonprofit groups he wanted investigated for ' political activity			1
' ten of those organizations are conservative ; two are liberal			0
the right - leaning groups included the @entity235 , @entity236 , the retiree - focused @entity237 , and the anti-abortion @entity239			1
@entity25 intensified his written complaints as the presidential election approached , sometimes objecting to how the @entity0 handled ' social welfare ' groups and claiming that @entity0 routinely ' misinterprets the law ' by allowing them to engage in any political - related activity while receiving a tax exemption			2
then - @entity0 deputy commissioner @entity247 replied at one point that the agency has broad discretion – which it appears to have used – in choosing which organizations to approve and which to reject			0
' there is no standard questionnaire used to obtain information about political activities , ' @entity247 insisted			0
@entity256 , a spokesman for sen. @entity25 , told @entity258 that he ' believes the problem here is that the @entity0 has apparently failed to enforce the law , involving both liberal and conservative groups			1
' @entity256 said the senator 's office had already published much of his correspondence that @entity8 released wednesday , some of it back in 2012			2
' in a july 2012 letter he made public later that year , he cited two television ads , one targeting a @entity217 candidate and one targeting a @entity271 candidate , ' @entity256 told @entity258			0
@entity25 has focused in his letter to the @entity0 on an apparent contradiction in two separate @entity275 regulations			0
one specifies that 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) status , one of several tax - exempt designations the @entity0 can award , is reserved for groups that operate ' exclusively ' for social welfare and do n't engage in partisan politics			0
but another federal government guideline specifies that groups can be considered ' exclusively ' focused on public welfare if they are ' primarily engaged ' in promoting a community 's general welfare			0
that conflict – between regulators who take the word ' exclusively ' literally and those who rely instead on the word ' primarily ' – has vexed lawmakers on both sides of the aisle			0
in may 2013 , a @entity275 inspector general report found that the @entity0 had been ' using inappropriate criteria to identify [ conservative ] organizations applying for tax - exempt status ( e.g. , lists of past and future donors )			0
' the @entity0 's secret program of playing political favorites continued for more than 18 months , the report revealed , and ' delayed processing of targeted groups applications ' in the run - up to the 2012 presidential election .			1

bombshell emails indicate handling of scheme targeting conservative nonprofit groups was *quarterbacked* at the @entity0 's @entity5 office
sen. @entity25 , a @entity28 @entity27 , applied pressure in 2012 to the @entity0 to slow down mostly right - leaning groups he thought were too ' political '
former @entity0 official @entity44 emailed @entity0 managers about how to tell if a ' be on the @entity322 ' targeting list applied to specific tea party groups
@entity8 got emails in a @entity10 lawsuit , casting new doubt on claims that the plot involved ' rogue employees ' in @entity23
