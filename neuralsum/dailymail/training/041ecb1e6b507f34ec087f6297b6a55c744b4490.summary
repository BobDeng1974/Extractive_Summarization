it comes as a surprise to hear @entity3 ’s goalkeeping howler for @entity4 against the @entity5 in the last @entity6 was not the worst moment of his career			1
nor was the aftermath of blame , or being relegated from the @entity11 with @entity12 the following may			2
far worse was the powerlessness of not playing for @entity14 last season , watching helplessly from the substitutes ’ bench as the club ‘ imploded ’ and sank into the championship saddled by £ 177million of debt			1
of all his travails over the past four years , it was this experience that hurt @entity3 the most			1
the 34 - year - old has the chance to help make amends next saturday , when @entity14 meet @entity27 in the @entity19 play - off final at @entity29 , and seems energised by the chance to make a difference			1
in the meantime , he is determined not to ‘ waste energy ’ on a dream he believes is out of his control			0
dejection : @entity14 goalkeeper @entity3 says the powerlessness of not playing last season was worse than his @entity6 blunder against the @entity5 in @entity40 gaffe : @entity3 allowed a routine shot to fall out of his grasp with @entity4 drawing the game 1 - 1 the @entity19 play - off final is the most lucrative fixture in the whole of global sport because the winner gets access to @entity11 riches			1
this year ’s play - off is worth at least £ 134million — and that is a worse - case scenario			2
it is £ 62m of @entity11 prize money even if finishing bottom next season , plus four years of subsequent ‘ parachute ’ payments totalling a further £ 72m at least			2
however , if @entity14 win , they face the horror prospect of being hit with a fine of perhaps £ 60m or more because of financial fair play rules			1
the goalkeeper has started just one match for @entity4 since allowing @entity67 ’s shot to slip through his hands in @entity69 in june 2010			1
his name was not even mentioned as @entity71 revealed his @entity6 squad this week			0
@entity3 , however , is not bitter			1
nor does he look for sympathy			0
instead , he says the intervening years have been the best of his life , bringing marriage and two children , even if the 2012 - 13 season brought another crushing low professionally			2
he said : ‘ my wife went for lunch with neighbours and the neighbour said , “ my husband ’s really sorry for what happened at the @entity6 ”			0
‘ why ? @entity87 , we ’re still surviving			0
i ’m still a professional footballer living an amazing life			0
it ’s not like i ’ve suffered			0
it ’s been tough professionally and personally because your pride gets hit , but it ’s a big picture			0
jubilant : @entity3 celebrates after @entity14 score the winning goal against @entity95 in the semi-final disdain : @entity97 brought in @entity3 and then promptly signed @entity98 to replace him as no 1 ‘ the @entity4 thing was beyond football but last year was the worst year in the best part of 20 years of professional football			1
i ’ve been in teams that have struggled but i have not sat on the side and watched a team implode or disintegrate or combust into nothing thinking “ i can help ”			2
it ’s a tough experience			0
’ @entity3 can scarcely hide his disdain for former @entity14 boss @entity97 , who signed him on a free transfer from @entity12 in the summer of 2012 and then dropped him when @entity110 international @entity98 suddenly arrived on £ 80,000 a week			1
@entity3 found out only when watching @entity111			1
by late november @entity14 were bottom of the @entity11 and @entity97 had been sacked			1
but although new boss @entity114 initially brought @entity3 back into the team , the @entity113 endured another four months on the sidelines before being recognised as @entity14 ’ no 1			1
relegation came as little surprise to @entity3 , who had seen the warning signs in pre-season when his new club splurged almost £ 7m on agents ’ fees alone			1
he is frank enough to acknowledge @entity14 ’s problems are not over yet , either			2
first choice : @entity114 has reinstalled @entity3 as his no 1 this season loan stars : @entity3 's former replacement @entity98 is still @entity110 's first choice in goal highly - paid players such as @entity98 , @entity131 and @entity132 have been sent on loan to reduce a wage bill that is higher than that of @entity137 champions and @entity139 finalists @entity140 , but the £ 120m bounty of promotion could be hit by the threat of a £ 62.1m fine for breaching the @entity146 ’s @entity145 regulations			1
@entity14 had losses of £ 65.4m last year , far in excess of the £ 8m allowed in the second tier			2
@entity3 said : ‘ we sat in pre-season and there was me , @entity158 , @entity159 , @entity160 , @entity161 and we said , “ there will be a week at one point in the season and we ’ll all be there and we ’ll know we ’re in trouble ”			1
the guys who come - and - go came and went			0
we played a game in december and we were all playing and we realised we were bang in it because something was going terribly wrong			0
‘ there are people at the club who are still fighting fires and , come the summer , will have a lot of headaches because of previous decisions			0
you have a group of guys that have gone out on loan and are coming back and wo n’t want to be at the club			2
fees : @entity180 and the club are facing fines of £ 60m for breaking @entity145 ‘ i ’m not picking on people but you look at a guy like @entity132 who has gone to @entity186			0
if we get promoted does he want to come to a @entity11 scrap when he has cruised through a @entity190 season ? people like @entity131			2
does he want to take a step backwards or sideways ? ‘ some of these guys have got their own agendas and , regardless of saturday ’s outcome , you need to draw the line somewhere			0
’ it feels like @entity3 has drawn a line under @entity4 , too , although he insists he will ‘ never say never ’			1
he has not been involved since june 2012 but has no expectations of that changing while he plays in the @entity19			0
big money : @entity132 ( left ) and @entity131 have been out on loan this season to reduce a wage bill that is bigger than @entity137 champions and @entity139 finalists @entity140 ‘ this season was never going to be about getting into a @entity6 squad , ’ he said			2
‘ it was always going to be about playing football regularly again			0
to go beyond that is folly , really , because you ’re wasting effort and energy			0
’ @entity217 ’s predecessor , @entity216 , will be in the opposition ’s dugout next week , prompting @entity3 to issue a blunt assessment of his experience with @entity4 during the @entity27 manager ’s reign			1
‘ none , ’ he says			0
@entity224 , age and experience seem to have brought a clearer sense of perspective to this engaging , erudite footballer .			0

goalkeeper says @entity4 howler was not the worst moment of his career
worse was watching @entity14 implode while sitting powerless on the bench
@entity3 is back as @entity238 1 and is *enjoying* a stellar season
