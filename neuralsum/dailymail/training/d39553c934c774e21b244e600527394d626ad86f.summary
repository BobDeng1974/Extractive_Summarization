by @entity0 published : 09:26 est , 17 may 2013 updated : 09:49 est , 17 may 2013 a remote @entity2 volcano continues to erupt , spewing lava and ash clouds - highlighting concerns over the closure of geological observation centers in the area			1
the @entity9 said a continuous cloud of ash , steam and gas from @entity14 has been seen 20,000 feet above sea level			1
@entity16 , the @entity17 scientist in charge at the observatory , estimates the lava fountain rose several hundred feet into the air			1
spewing lava : fiery red molten rock can be seen erupting from @entity14 volcano , observed here from @entity26 seismic instruments are picking up constant tremors from the eruption at @entity14 , located about 625 miles ( 1,000 kilometers ) southwest of @entity30			1
residents of @entity26 , 37 miles ( 60 kilometers ) away , have reported seeing a glow from the summit			1
@entity14 is among the most active volcanoes in the @entity36 arc , with nearly 40 known eruptions , according to the observatory			1
it comes as scientists monitoring @entity9 's volcanoes are forced to shut down stations that provide real - time tracking of eruptions and forgo repairs of seismic equipment amid ongoing federal budget cuts - moves that could mean delays in getting vital information to airline pilots and emergency planners			2
the @entity9 can no longer seismically monitor five volcanoes with real - time equipment to detect imminent eruptions			2
such equipment is especially important in helping pilots receive up - to - the - minute warnings about spewing ash that can cause engine failures and other problems			1
under threat : some @entity2 volcano observation units have had to be closed due to federal budget cuts			2
they often warn aircraft in the area of any possible dangerous ash clouds @entity9 has 52 active volcanoes , with many of them located on the @entity71 along international air routes between @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity75			1
@entity14 is one of several dozen volcanoes that make up the @entity78			1
the arc stretches across the @entity80 in the south - west of @entity9 to north - eastern @entity81 , 3,000km away			2
it follows the line where the pacific tectonic plate meets the @entity74 plate			2
@entity87 officials said the observatory , funded by the @entity17 , provides a crucial service , including early warnings of seismic changes that may portend an impending eruption			2
monitors need to be operating all the time , not just during major eruptions , said @entity95 , an @entity87 dispatcher			0
' i think the public gets kind of complacent when nothing exciting is happening and think , " oh , why should we throw money at that ? " ' said @entity95 , who was on duty in 1989 when the @entity103 blew 115 miles from @entity30			1
following that eruption , several aircraft experienced damage from ash - including a @entity107 carrying 231 passengers that lost all four engines after flying into an ash cloud			1
the plane dropped more than two miles in five minutes before the crew was able to restart the engines and land safely in @entity30			1
worldwide , hundreds of flights are diverted each year because of volcanic activity			0
in 2010 , an eruption in @entity118 spread debris over @entity73 , threatening most flight routes from the @entity121 to @entity73 , and within @entity73 itself			0
early warning : the steam and the fresh lava flow could be seen on the north side of the volcano on monday the @entity9 volcano monitoring system , first created in 1988 , is intended to help pilots avoid such problems			1
but it has regressed over the past few years because of shrinking finances , and now the across - the - board spending cuts known as sequestration are further squeezing operations			0
for example , gone is a plan to install seismic monitors at @entity138 , a remote mountain on an uninhabited island in the @entity71			0
the volcano experienced a low - level eruption earlier this month that continues to discharge steam , gas and heat , although no ash clouds have been detected in the past week			1
' because our budget has been declining for so long , we have no hope of actually addressing the @entity151 eruption in the way that it really should be , ' said geophysicist @entity16 , the @entity17 scientist in charge at the @entity9			0
@entity14 , 625 miles from @entity30 , does have seismic instruments , which picked up tremors signaling a possible eruption			1
satellite imagery also showed a lot of heat in the mountain			0
cloud : the volcano continued to pump out gas and steam on tuesday - with the eruption still continuing friday in @entity9 , 32 volcanoes once had 200 working seismic instruments			1
now 80 of those instruments have fallen into disrepair and ca n't be fixed due to the @entity17 budget cuts			0
that means five of those volcanoes are n't monitored electronically at all , and the number could rise if more instruments go without maintenance			0
cuts also have reduced the number of days helicopter crews can fly to repair equipment in remote locations , from 140 days in 2008 to 36			0
the observatory still uses satellite data , infrasound and reports from pilots and others to detect eruptions			0
but none of those offer real - time information			0
sound waves were picked up the @entity151 eruption , but it took 40 minutes for the data to reach scientists in @entity30 , 940 miles northeast of the volcano			2
these days , the observatory is operating on $ 4million annually , roughly half of its heyday budget			0
four other observatories in the @entity205 - in @entity206 , @entity207 , @entity208 and @entity209 - also have faced cuts , leading to a reduction in lab research , studies of eruption histories and lava survey flights			2
in @entity209 , lava flyovers of the @entity215 's @entity214 were reduced from once a week to once every two weeks			2
it 's still early in the federal downsizing process , and resources already are spread thin , said @entity219 , chief of the five @entity17 observatories			0
and while these types of cuts may not be immediately felt by the public - unlike the furloughs of air traffic controllers that caused flight delays nationwide - they are just as damaging , he said			0
' the challenges with what we do is that it does n't happen all the time , ' he said			0
' but when it does happen , then the ramifications can be very large			0

@entity14 has been spewing ash , steam , lava and gas since monday
glowing lava could be seen 37 miles away by residents of @entity26
