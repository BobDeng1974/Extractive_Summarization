by @entity0 published : 18:40 est , 19 march 2012 updated : 02:41 est , 20 march 2012 controversy : @entity3 's proposals were condemned by motoring groups as ' a toll too far ' controversial plans to privatise roads and create ‘ @entity8 lanes ’ that would allow the wealthiest drivers to bypass traffic jams were met with anger last night			1
motoring and transport groups condemned @entity3 ’s pay - to - drive proposals as ‘ ludicrous ’ and ‘ a toll too far ’			1
under the plans , tolls could be introduced on new highways and existing roads could be widened to create additional lanes that drivers could use to get around congestion – at a cost			0
the @entity23 warned the government was creating ‘ a poll tax on wheels ’ while @entity25 complained of a ‘ rip - off ’			1
haulage firms said it was ‘ unthinkable ’ to introduce tolls at a time when motorists and firms were being crippled with record fuel prices and the highest levels of fuel tax in @entity36			1
ministers have ruled out a comprehensive national network of road tolls , but only until the end of this @entity41 in 2015			0
the row erupted after the prime minister said yesterday he was proposing a ‘ radical ’ plan to kick - start the economy by allowing private firms and investment funds to compete to build , operate and maintain motorways and trunk roads in @entity50 and @entity51			1
under the plans , motorists will not pay tolls to use existing roads			0
but firms given long - term leases on sections of motorway or dual carriageway could widen them to create additional pay - as - you - go lanes that drivers could use to beat congestion			0
these are nicknamed ‘ @entity8 lanes ’ in the @entity69 because only those wealthy enough to drive luxury cars can afford to use them			1
mr @entity3 , who used to drive a @entity8 , is now chauffeured in an official @entity71 limousine			0
milking the motorist : @entity3 used to drive a @entity8 , pictured , the expensive car that has inspired the nickname for the exclusive lanes new roads constructed from scratch would operate like @entity78 toll roads , much like the existing system on the @entity80 through the @entity81 from @entity82 to @entity83			0
motoring groups said @entity86 ’s 33million drivers were fed up with being ‘ fleeced ’ and simply do n’t trust ministers to live up to their promises			1
they fear drivers will be priced off the roads by profiteering companies , as has happened with privatised train companies			0
the @entity98 raises more than £ 48billion a year from motorists in the form of duty and vat on fuel , vehicle excise duty , vat on car sales and company car tax – but less than £ 10billion of this is spent on the roads			2
private operators who took over the running of existing roads would receive a share of the near £ 6billion raised each year from road tax according to how many vehicles used the roads			2
in his speech to the @entity113 , mr @entity3 said there was an ‘ urgent ’ need for private sector funds because the government can not afford to address growing gridlock and pothole problems			1
but @entity23 president @entity120 warned : ‘ the privatisation of the railway network has hardly been a spectacular success and millions of drivers will be concerned if one of our most important and used national assets , the strategic road network , is sold off			1
‘ many drivers would suspect new ownership is the thin end of the wedge leading to national road pricing			2
new charges would be a toll too far			0
’ @entity135 , of the @entity136 , said : ‘ @entity86 drivers simply do n’t trust the government to come up with a new way of paying for roads that will not lead to increased costs in the long run			1
drivers already pay far more in taxes and duties than they get back in investment in new roads			0
’ @entity148 , chief executive of the @entity149 , said tolls on new roads were ‘ quite unthinkable ’ and ‘ ludicrous ’ at a time of record fuel prices hitting motorists and hauliers			2
@entity25 ’s transport spokesman @entity155 said motorists face ‘ a rip - off ’ adding : ‘ the prime minister ’s double - speak gives the impression that his privatisation plans will only see tolls applied to new roads			2
‘ yet he has redefined new roads to include anything that adds capacity including road widening and junction improvements			0
motorists will rightly consider that to be a clear plan for charging for existing roads			0
’ but professor @entity171 , director of the @entity172 , gave a ‘ cautious welcome ’ to the idea of private sector investment to tackle the ‘ chronic levels of traffic and congestion ’ .			2

@entity23 warned the government was creating ‘ a poll tax on wheels ’
