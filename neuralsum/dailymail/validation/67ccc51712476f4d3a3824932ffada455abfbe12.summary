former @entity1 winger @entity0 has warned @entity2 about setting his ambitions too high , too soon			1
the 20 - year - old is currently locked in contract negotiations with the @entity6 after rejecting what manager @entity7 described as an ' incredible ' offer , reportedly £ 100,000 - a - week			1
his current deal is not due to expire until 2017 but the current impasse in talks - which will not resume until the end of the season - has led the youngster to be linked with a number of @entity17 's top clubs			2
there has been much speculation over the future of @entity1 youngster @entity2 ( centre ) @entity2 , who is currently on international duty with @entity23 , is in the process of negotiating a new contract @entity0 believes it would be a mistake , however , for @entity2 to go looking for a multi-million pound move before he has properly proved himself			1
' i would advise any young player who has been in the game for one or one and half years to stay and learn his trade , ' he told @entity33			2
' show consistency over a four or five - year period before you make a big move , because then he will be judged as a £ 50million player			1
' i do n't think he is ready for a move to @entity40 , @entity41 or @entity42			2
talks have finished until the end of the season , but there has been speculation over a big - money move abroad former @entity1 winger @entity0 believes that @entity2 should stay and learn his trade at @entity50 ' as a @entity1 fan i want him to stay but i think himself he needs to be very careful			1
' unfortunately the bad advice often sounds the most lucrative and therefore the best advice			0
' has he been playing consistently well over a long time ? no he has n't , and maybe his form has suffered because of the whole situation about that ( contract )			0
' @entity0 said recent history is littered with examples of poor decisions and failures by young players and he did not want @entity62 to make the same mistake			0
' we saw it with @entity66 and @entity67 , who both went to @entity42			0
where are they now ? ' he added			0
' i think any young player should show a level of consistency where you are happy and people accept you and then if you want to put yourself under pressure by making a big money move do that - because it can all go wrong			1
@entity2 needs to show consistency over a four or five - year period to warrant a big move , according to @entity0 @entity0 noted that @entity2 should not make the same mistake as @entity66 , who moved prematurely ' i think [ he needs ] another two or three years at @entity1 and if he then decides he wants to move on then fine			1
' while @entity2 is still trying to establish himself as one of @entity1 's top players , one of their very best - @entity83 - will be leaving in the summer to join @entity84			1
there have been suggestions the @entity6 captain 's legacy has been tarnished somewhat by his senseless sending - off against @entity90 last sunday , coming a year after his slip against @entity92 played a huge part in the club missing out on the title			2
@entity0 , however , dismissed such talk			0
' @entity83 and @entity97 are the two greatest players for @entity1 , ' he said			0
' nothing has changed because he got sent off against @entity90 and nothing will change in the rest for the season			0

@entity2 has been linked with a move away from @entity1
