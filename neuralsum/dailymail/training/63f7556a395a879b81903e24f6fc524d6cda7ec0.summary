@entity0 said this week that @entity1 is ' arguably the best player who 's ever played in the @entity2 ' , but the @entity4 captain did n't make his manager 's all - time @entity5 in 2012			1
@entity0 , who dropped @entity1 for saturday 's 1 - 0 win over @entity8 , confirmed that the veteran midfielder has been offered a new contract at @entity4 and told reporters : ' i love working with @entity1 , he 's arguably the best player who 's ever played in the @entity2			1
' in april 2012 though , appearing as a guest on @entity14 , @entity0 picked @entity15 and @entity16 as his midfield duo in his all - time @entity5 , with @entity19 legend @entity18 playing slightly in front of the @entity22 pair			1
@entity1 prepares to come off the bench against @entity8 on saturday @entity1 replaced @entity24 with @entity4 going on to score a late winner through @entity26 @entity0 appears on @entity27 @entity14 3 while @entity29 manager back in april 2012 @entity0 ' all - time @entity5 clarifying his selection , the then - @entity29 manager said : ' i went for a sort of triangle in midfield with @entity15 , who is one of the best passers of the ball in the duration of the @entity2			1
' a wee bit of bite in there with @entity16 : win it , give it			0
' and i guy who invented for me what i call the @entity18 zone - that space in between the midfield and the front line			0
( it was a ) tough choice between him and @entity49			0
