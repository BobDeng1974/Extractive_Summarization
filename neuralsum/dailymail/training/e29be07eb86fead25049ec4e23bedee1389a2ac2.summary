@entity2 has expanded into the @entity4 subcontinent , the leader of the terror group said in a video statement released thursday , with a regional group that he vowed would bring @entity8 law to the region and ' wage jihad against its enemies			1
' at least three @entity4 states with large @entity15 populations had been put on alert in the wake of the video 's release , local tv stations reported			2
in the video , which was seen online by the @entity23 monitoring group , @entity20 said @entity2 had been preparing for years to set up in the region			1
while the statement referred to the ' @entity34 ' - a term that most commonly refers to @entity4 , @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity40 - @entity20 's comments were widely seen as directed at @entity4 , a largely @entity41 nation with a large @entity15 minority			1
@entity20 said the group , @entity43 in the @entity4 subcontinent , would fight for an @entity8 state and laws across the region , ' which was part of the @entity15 ' territories before it was occupied by the infidel enemy '			1
until recently , @entity4 had largely seen itself as beyond the recruiting territory of international jihadists like @entity2			1
over the past few months , however , the @entity53 militant group , which has seized control of large parts of @entity56 and @entity57 , has grown in prominence in @entity4 , and is increasingly believed to be gaining followers here			2
sickening : @entity2 often targets civilians using suicide bombers			0
pictured is a crater formed by an explosion next to the devastated @entity65 in @entity66 on september 21 , 2008 , following an attack by the group that left 60 dead @entity2 leader @entity20 announced the formation of an @entity4 branch of his militant group he said would spread @entity8 rule and ' raise the flag of jihad ' across the subcontinent			1
he said : ' my @entity15 brothers everywhere , peace be with you today , i announce to all @entity15 in the world and especially in the @entity4 subcontinent , the founding of a new branch of @entity43			0
' this is to help raise the flag of jihad and the return of the @entity8 rule in the subcontinent , which one day used to be part of the land of the @entity15 until the infidel enemy took it over and divided it			2
' he also renewed a longstanding vow of loyalty to @entity97 @entity96 leader @entity95 , in an apparent snub to the @entity53 armed group challenging @entity2 for leadership of transnational @entity102 militancy			2
@entity103 described the formation of ' @entity2 in the @entity34 ' as glad tidings for @entity15 ' in @entity106 , @entity38 , @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109 , and @entity110 ' and said the new wing would rescue @entity15 there from injustice and oppression			0
last month , an @entity4 engineering student who had traveled to @entity56 with friends , and who was thought to have joined the @entity53 , was reported killed			0
@entity4 home minister @entity118 met thursday morning with top security and intelligence officials to discuss the threat			0
a spokesman for @entity4 's ruling @entity123 said the statement was ' a matter of serious concern			2
but there is nothing to worry about			0
we have a strong government at the federal level			0
' @entity4 , though , has a notoriously underfunded and ill - trained security infrastructure			0
in 2008 , a small group of @entity37 militants attacked @entity135 , @entity4 's financial hub , effectively shutting down the city for days and leaving 166 people killed			1
@entity139 has also waged a long - running insurgency war in @entity110 , @entity4 's only majority - @entity15 state , with militants fighting to bring independence to the @entity144 region or join it to neighboring @entity37			1
the fighting has left thousands of people dead			0
some analysts saw the announcement , which showed @entity20 speaking in front of a dark curtain , as an effort to revive the fortunes of @entity2 , which has been largely eclipsed , at least publicly , by the @entity53 , the militant group that in @entity57 and @entity56 that recently executed two @entity155 journalists			1
' this may be ruse for @entity20 to enhance his diminishing clout among @entity160 muslims and @entity37 mujahedeen who are veering in a big way toward the @entity53 militant group leader , @entity164 , ' said @entity165 , a prominent @entity4 intelligence and security analyst			1
@entity168 , @entity169 at @entity170 , meanwhile , said that @entity2 's establishment of a local branch in @entity4 seems geared to take advantage of the trend of fighters returning from @entity97 he said : ' @entity2 leader @entity20 's announcement of the creation of a branch of @entity2 in the @entity4 subcontinent , to be known as @entity180 , is a likely response to recent global and regional developments			1
' for some time now , @entity2 has seen its authority eroded by the fact that it is no longer able to independently carry out large scale attacks anywhere in the world , and by the emergence of rival factions			0
' in light of the @entity192 withdrawal from @entity97 in december 2014 , some battle hardened fighters freed up from @entity97 will almost certainly transition into @entity4 , thus increasing the capacity of local groups			0
@entity2 's establishment of a local branch seems geared to take advantage of this trend			0

@entity20 said @entity2 would fight for an @entity8 state in @entity4
he said his group had been preparing for years to set up in the region
some think it 's part of an effort to win back media attention from @entity209
@entity4 saw itself as beyond the recruiting territory of international jihadists
