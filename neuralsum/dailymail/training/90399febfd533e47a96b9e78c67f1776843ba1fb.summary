the squatters , believed to be eastern @entity7 , keep locals up all night by playing bongo drums and dump piles of rubbish in their street in @entity13 , south @entity14			1
but police have been left powerless to boot them out because the building is classed as commercial property			1
@entity18 say the squatters sit on the roof and make noise , making their lives a misery new laws introduced last year which allow squatters to be jailed for six months only cover residential properties			1
angry locals have branded powers to evict squatters ' pointless ' and ' stupid ' and demanded the government reform the law			1
@entity32 and @entity33 , whose house backs on to the squat , have lived in the road for 40 years but say their lives have been blighted by the constant noise coming from the property			1

the council , the police , there is nothing they can do			0
the squatters have more rights than we 've got			2

mr @entity39 said the squatters were well versed in the legal loophole and were ' playing the system '			2
@entity33 and @entity39 say the squatters sit on the roof ( pictured ) of the building next door that overlooks their back garden and make a lot of noise he said : ' the law is an ass			1
