@entity1 manager @entity0 criticised the inconsistency of referee @entity3 after their defeat @entity3 sent @entity1 midfielder @entity7 off for two bookable offences at the @entity9 @entity0 believes @entity6 winger @entity12 should have been sent off for committing the same fouls @entity18 ' the foul ( by @entity7 ) stopped an attack and if i 'm being honest it could have been a yellow card , ' @entity0 said			1
' but by the same rule @entity12 should also have had two yellow cards			0
' you can not pick and choose - you either referee by the rules or by common sense , and i think the referee picked when he was going to referee by the rules and when by common sense , and that is not acceptable			0
' @entity1 have not won at home since october , and @entity0 begged for patience from unimpressed supporters after they made their feelings clear at the final whistle			2
@entity7 leaves after being sent off for @entity1 as they lost 1 - 0 against @entity6 at home again ' we are trying and i think they ( the fans ) need to accept reality - i think they should look at what has been going on for four or five years and i think they should be a little more patient now , ' he added			2
' it 's true that we do n't give them too much and it 's unfair to ask the fans for anything - we have to make sure we give them a few wins at home so they can enjoy them			0
' we need to be positive			0
i think we lost the first 45 minutes of a very important game and when you do that against a team like @entity6 , normally you get punished - then we tried and played better when we were down to 10 men			0
' but on the day it was not enough so it is a good way of learning that you can not give too much away in a game like this			0
' @entity1 manager @entity0 feels @entity3 put in an unacceptable performance at the @entity9			1
