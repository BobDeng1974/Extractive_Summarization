@entity0 has come out fighting on behalf of his embattled @entity2 side — denying that they are in crisis mode after a shattering run of five consecutive test defeats			1
as the national team returned to their @entity10 base to prepare for saturday ’s @entity12 encounter with @entity13 at @entity14 , the head coach hit back at the intensifying criticism			2
asked if the latest loss , to @entity17 , leaves @entity2 in crisis , @entity0 offered an impassioned riposte			1
‘ i do n’t think that ’s true at all , ’ he said			0
@entity2 head coach @entity0 speaks to the assembled media at @entity22 on monday @entity0 looks pensive on the @entity14 pitch following his side 's 31 - 28 loss to the @entity17 ‘ if you say that , you ’re talking about a team that has no belief in what they ’re doing , has no sense of direction			1
a group of players who are not aligned with what you ’re trying to do and not agreeing with where you ’re going , who have poor discipline on and off the field — that ’s a team in crisis			2
for me at the moment , i do n’t see any of those traits in this @entity2 team			0
’ @entity0 called in a 28 - man squad on monday			1
@entity44 is back and destined to start in the back row			2
there were also call - ups for @entity49 flanker @entity48 , @entity52 scrum - half @entity50 and centres @entity53 and @entity55			1
@entity56 may earn a selection reprieve , despite his poor form			0
@entity0 said of his struggling @entity59 : ‘ by his own admission he has n’t played to the level he would have hoped			2
’ @entity63 centre @entity55 has been drafted into the @entity2 squad for the clash with @entity13 @entity67 centre @entity53 has also been called up by @entity0 ahead of saturday 's @entity68 forwards : @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity48 , @entity44 , @entity79 , @entity80 ( captain ) , @entity82 , @entity83 backs : @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity50 , @entity87 , @entity55 , @entity88 , @entity56 , @entity89 , @entity53 , @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 @entity56 could play at inside centre , with @entity89 at fly - half , and @entity0 added : ‘ @entity56 and his contribution with the way the game has unfolded at 12 is an option			1
’ @entity88 is unlikely to feature and @entity101 has been left at @entity102			0
despite the rotation , @entity80 is expected to stay in the team as captain			0
meanwhile , former @entity107 captain @entity106 warned that @entity2 ’s top stars are being worn out			0
‘ we are killing the players , ’ @entity106 said			0
‘ at the moment we are playing far too much rugby			0
’ @entity114 flanker @entity44 ( left ) and @entity63 blindside @entity48 may get a chance to impress			1
