by @entity0 how many people would humanity need to send on an interstellar voyager to ensure the survival of a colony beyond the solar system ? according to one expert the answer is a staggering 20,000 to 40,000 people			2
a study suggests that , in order to ensure significant genetic diversity , such large numbers will be needed if any space colony is to survive a trip lasting 150 years			1
dr @entity16 from @entity17 says a future interstellar mission would only work if a large human colony was taken along for the trip on a large starship ( illustration of a ' stanford torus ' , a proposed design for a space habitat made in the 1970s , pictured )			1
the ideal number would be a population of 40,000 dr @entity16 is an anthropologist and prehistorian at @entity17 in @entity29 , and is also involved with @entity30 , an organisation dedicated to advancing interstellar starship research and development			1
at @entity30 he is working on @entity34 , a study of the various factors at play for a future deep space mission - including the number of humans to take			2
the 100 - year @entity41 is a joint endeavour run by @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity30 and the @entity45			2
announced in january 2012 , the project has an overall goal of achieving manned interstellar travel by 2112			0
to do so it is evaluating a number of different techonolgies , including ‘ warping ’ space time to travel great distances in short time frames at faster - than - light speeds			0
the project is also considering building ‘ generation ships ’ that move slowly but have a self - sustainable long - term population			0
to date @entity44 has contributed $ 100,000 ( £ 60,000 ) to the project and @entity43 $ 1 million ( £ 600,000 )			0
and in a paper published @entity62 he describes how taking less than 20,000 people on an interstellar voyage would be ‘ risky ’ over multiple generations			0
‘ designing interstellar starships for human migration to exoplanets requires establishing the starship population , which factors into many variables including closed - ecosystem design , architecture , mass and propulsion , ’ dr @entity16 writes			1
he continues : ‘ i find that previously proposed such populations , on the order of a few hundred individuals , are significantly too low to consider based on current understanding of vertebrate ( including human ) genetics and population dynamics			0
’ he says that having an ‘ @entity84 ’ of 40,000 , 23,400 of which are ‘ reproductive males and females , ’ would be a good figure to ensure the health of a colony travelling for 150 years , or five generations			2
such a number of people is necessary to avoid interbreeding among the relatively small human population according to dr @entity16			1
the study considered a hypothetical 150 - year mission to a neighbouring star			1
increasing spacecraft speeds by a factor of 1,000 would make a mission to a star such as @entity102 ( shown with date the distance was calculated ) possible , which is 4.24 light years away pictured is an illustration of the @entity106 , an interstellar ship envisaged by @entity44 's dr @entity108 that could use warp technology to travel ' faster than light '			1
it could be an accurate representation of what the first mission beyond the solar system will look like during a talk for @entity44 ’s future in - space operations , dr @entity16 elaborated that no natural populations of vertebrates on @entity120 dip below five to 7,000 , reports @entity121			1
‘ and when they do go below this , sometimes they survive , but many times they go into what ’s called a demographic or extinction vortex , ’ he explains			0
the best way to ensure the survival of a colony on a long - duration journey to a distant alien planet would be to have a ship large enough to house a population of a town			0
another less preferred option , however , would be to send frozen sperm and eggs from @entity120 - bound people			0
dr @entity16 also explains how his study would be applicable for colonisation of worlds inside out solar system such as @entity145			2
for interstellar colonisation , however , he admits that it will require significant advances in technology before any such missions is possible			0
but if spacecraft speeds can be increased by 1,000 , then a mission to our closest neighbouring star @entity155 lasting 140 years is feasible , says dr @entity16 .			1

dr @entity16 from @entity17 says a future interstellar mission would only work if a large human colony was taken along for the trip
he says a population of at least 20,000 is needed to prevent *inbreeding*
the ideal number would be 40,000 , with over half being male and females of a reproductive age
study considered a hypothetical 150 - year mission to a neighbouring star
increasing spacecraft speeds by a factor of 1,000 would make a mission to a star such as @entity102 possible , which is 4.24 light years away
but dr @entity16 does not *discuss* the technology that might make this endeavour feasible
