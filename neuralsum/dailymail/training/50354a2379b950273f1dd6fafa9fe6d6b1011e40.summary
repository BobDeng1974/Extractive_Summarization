homeopathy has long been slated as witchcraft , due to the lack of proper scientific evidence that it works			0
now , one scientist has taken matters into her own hands to prove the point			0
@entity9 , a forensic chemist from southern @entity10 , filmed herself downing 50 homeopathic sleeping tablets in one go to prove they were nothing but ' sugar pills ' with no active ingredients			1
ninety minutes later , she reported feeling no different - and says this proves thousands of people the world over are being misled			1
her experiment was part of her campaign to stop national pharmacy retailers selling homeopathic products that ' have no medicine in them ' her experiment was part of her campaign to stop national pharmacy retailers in the @entity33 selling homeopathic products , which , as she puts it ' have no f * * * ing medicine ' in them			1
ms @entity9 , who goes under the @entity38 , wrote in a recent blog : ' [ the theory is ] that diluting a substance makes it more powerful			1
by this line of thinking , the dilutions continue in succession several times			0
' in the homeopathic remedies that are sold over the counter , they dilute the medications to the point where there is no measurable dose of the alleged active ingredient			1
' allow me to rephrase : there 's no @entity56			0
' she adds that homeopathic remedies rely on the notion that water has a ' memory ' - and the more you dilute a medicine , the stronger that memory gets and the more potent the medicine becomes			1
during her six - minute film , she slates national pharmacy brands that even sell their own branded versions of homeopathic treatments - accusing them of endorsing ' pseudo science ' and saying customers deserve better			1
she goes on to say : ' i do n’t know about you , but if i ’ve just had an allergic reaction i do n’t want the homeopathic version of epinephrine for my medication			1
' the petition reads : please stop carrying homeopathic treatments at your pharmacies			1
your stores carry real medications that are proven to work			0
homeopathic remedies are defined to be diluted to the point were they no longer contain any of the active ingredient			1
by selling homeopathic remedies , you are endorsing remedies that may prevent people from seeking real treatments that work			1
because of this , they can be dangerous			0
to clarify , this is not targeting ' natural ' remedies like supplements			0
this is solely about the products labeled ' homeopathic ' and with active ingredients measured in ' @entity103 ' units , indicating that there is no measurable active ingredient			1
' if i ’ve just had surgery , i do n’t want the homeopathic version of morphine			2
i want the real shot , not no medicine			0
' to prove her point , she opens a bottle containing 50 homeopathic sleeping pills and begins to take the whole bottle , washing handfuls of pills down with @entity119			1
' there is more actual drug in the caffeine in the @entity123 i 'm drinking , ' she adds			0
to test the theory that homeopathic pills are purely a ' sugar pill ' , she even crunches one to see			1
' it does taste like sugar - it 's delightful , ' she says			2
however she urges caution on repeating her experiment at home			0
' i really know how to read these labels so i can tell these pills have no medicine in them			2
' never try this with anything like melatonin or @entity138			0
' fast forward 45 and then 90 minutes and how is she feeling ? exactly the same - and ' not even slightly drowsy '			1
ms @entity9 has now started a petition on @entity141 calling for national chains to stop selling selling homeopathic medicine			1
it states : ' people will still buy products from your stores , but instead they 'll buy products that actually work with proven claims			2
' but both the @entity151 and the @entity154 @entity153 's science and technology committee say the @entity155 should stop funding homeopathic treatments because of a lack of evidence they work			1
the @entity151 has described homeopathy as ‘ witchcraft ’ , and last summer the @entity162 said homeopaths were putting people ’s lives at risk by discouraging them from seeking medical treatment			0
to test the theory that homeopathic pills are purely a ' sugar pill ' , she even crunches one to see			1
' it does taste like sugar - it 's delightful , ' she says and earlier this year , an @entity175 study concluded that homeopathy was no more effective than placebo			2
@entity175 ’s @entity178 analysed research into the effectiveness of alternative medicines on 68 health conditions and found ‘ there is no reliable evidence that homeopathy is effective ’ on any of them			2
the review , conducted by a working committee of medical experts , said homeopathy had no impact on a range of conditions including asthma , arthritis , sleep disturbances , cold and flu , chronic fatigue syndrome , eczema , cholera , burns , malaria and heroin addiction			0
earlier this year , an @entity175 study concluded homeopathy was no more effective than placebo the authors of the report said : ‘ no good - quality , well - designed studies with enough participants for a meaningful result reported either that homeopathy caused greater health improvements than a substance with no effect on the health condition [ placebo ] , or that homeopathy caused health improvements equal to those of another treatment			2
’ they went on to dismiss anecdotal support for the effectiveness of homeopathy , and urged health professionals to take account of scientific evidence when informing patients			0
‘ it is not possible to tell whether a health treatment is effective or not simply by considering individuals ’ experiences or healthcare practitioners ’ beliefs , ’ they said			0
homeopathy is a complementary medicine , the central principle of which is that ‘ like cures like ’ – that a substance that causes certain symptoms can also help to remove them in tiny doses			0
in @entity246 there are several @entity155 homeopathic hospitals and some gp practices offer the treatment but it is not widely available			2
the report prompted medical professionals to call for governments to stop legitimising homeopathy			2
professor @entity255 , an immunologist and emeritus professor of medicine at the @entity257 , told @entity258 the report was long overdue and said homeopathic treatments should now be ‘ put away ’ once and for all			2
he said : ‘ obviously we understand the placebo effect			0
we know that many people have illnesses that are short lived by its very nature and their bodies will cure them , so it ’s very easy for people to fall in trap that because they did @entity273 , @entity272 follows			0
’ he added he did not think it ethical to prescribe a placebo			0
