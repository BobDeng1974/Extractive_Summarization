@entity1 chairman @entity0 is adamant the decision to axe @entity3 in favour of rookie boss @entity5 less than 24 hours later was the right call			1
struggling @entity7 moved on to their third manager of the season on tuesday as former club captain @entity5 was swiftly appointed in a permanent capacity after @entity3 's disastrous five - month tenure had ended the previous day			1
@entity3 left the club languishing in the @entity15 relegation zone after taking just 19 points from a possible 72 and @entity5 , who at 32 is the @entity17 's youngest manager , inherits a team eight points adrift of safety with just five games to go			1
@entity5 has been officially unveiled as the new @entity1 manager at the @entity23 @entity1 chairman @entity0 is confident he has made the right appointment in @entity5 @entity5 ( @entity1 ) 32 @entity25 ( @entity26 ) 33 @entity27 ( @entity28 ) 33 @entity29 ( @entity30 ) 33 @entity31 ( @entity32 ) 34 but rather than making an interim appointment until the end of the season , @entity0 made the bold call to hand @entity5 a rolling contract which will see him in charge at the @entity23 next season , regardless of what division they are in			1
' that shows how much i believe in @entity5 , ' the 23 - year - old @entity0 said			1
' it 's definitely not just for the next five games , he 's got a free hit at it really			2
if he keeps us up it 's a miracle and if we go down it 's expected by everybody in this room but @entity5 will back himself to keep us up			2
' this is a long - term thing and we 're looking forward to the future with him that gets us back to our identity on and off the pitch and bring the positive times back to this football club			2
' the good times seem an increasingly distant memory for @entity1 , who have had unsuccessful stints with @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity3 at the helm after winning the @entity66 under @entity67 two years ago			1
@entity5 in action for @entity1 last year - the centre - back has been at the club for five years @entity5 ( right ) lifts the @entity66 with @entity71 after @entity1 's win over @entity73 in 2013 @entity1 must make up a seven - point deficit if they are to avoid relegation and stay in the championship @entity3 was sacked as @entity1 manager on monday following their 2 - 0 loss to @entity79 april 10 @entity80 ( a ) april 14 @entity81 ( a ) april 18 @entity82 ( @entity83 ) april 25 @entity84 ( @entity83 ) may 2 @entity85 ( a ) most of @entity67 's cup - winning squad have left , as has chairman @entity88 , but his grandson @entity0 insists his move to jettison @entity3 and appoint @entity5 was one the @entity1 owner approved of			1
' i 've known with my grandad , he 's got a reputation for making decisive decisions and i 've learned from the best , ' said @entity0			0
' it had to be done and i 'm looking forward to the future			0
' we speak a lot but he 's over in @entity99			0
he did n't know what i was doing on monday night			0
i spoke to him after and he 's 100 per cent behind me and @entity5			2
he 's looking forward to us winning football games again			0
' we 've won two games here all season and it 's bang average for a club of our size			0
' both @entity0 and @entity5 himself played down the risky element attached to appointing somebody whose only managerial experience has come with @entity7 ' youth teams			2
former defender @entity5 is one of the few remaining squad members who played in the top flight at @entity1 and he hopes his leadership qualities on the pitch will translate to the touchline			1
' it 's a massive opportunity and people who saw me as a player will know i do n't really believe in risks , ' he said			0
' i played with desire and passion and that 's something that i want to bring to management			0
people will see it as a risk but i just see the opportunity and the chance to do something great for this club and take it back to where it should be			0
