just shy : @entity2 captain @entity1 's former mentor says the @entity4 's decision not to sing the anthem is not political @entity2 's @entity4 cricket captain @entity1 does not sing the national anthem before matches as he is ' very shy ' , not because of politics , his former mentor says			1
the @entity11 - born batsman , who switched from the @entity4 to the @entity13 side in 2009 and was made captain late last year , has stayed quiet as @entity15 has boomed out at the @entity16			1
while some have suggested his silence is because he is from @entity19 , those close to the skipper say he is simply too shy to sing on camera			2
asked why he has not been belting out the anthem before the @entity24 matches in @entity25 and @entity26 this month , @entity1 said it was ' a long story ' and ' a personal thing '			2
adding that he would not sing the @entity4 anthem either , he said at a press conference : ' it 's pretty simple			1
i have never sung the national anthem when playing for @entity34 or @entity2			1
it does not make me any less proud to be an @entity13 cricketer			0
' i am extremely proud to be in the position that i am in and privileged to be captain of the @entity16 side			0
' @entity1 's former deputy headmaster @entity40 , who gave the cricketer a scholarship when he was 11 years old , told the @entity43 that his decision not to sing was not political			1
he said : ' he ’s a very shy fellow			0
i would imagine he ’d be quite self - conscious singing in that context			2
i would say it ’s as simple as that			0
he certainly was n’t in the school choir			0
' i ’ve known him since he was 11 and he was always very quiet and reserved			0
where he was confident was going out to bat			0
' i know people could read something into it , but i do n’t think it ’s political			0
he certainly is n’t political to my knowledge			0
' the @entity11 - born batsman has stayed quiet as @entity15 was boomed out at the @entity16 @entity2 rugby mascot @entity58 was described as a ' legend ' by full - back @entity61 for belting out the anthem before a @entity65 match this month mr @entity40 , now retired , added that @entity1 is ' well - mannered and polite but never an extroverted fellow			1
he would n’t overdo the chat			0
when i see him do these press conferences now i think , he could n’t have done that seven or eight years ago			0
he must be coached for that			0
' @entity1 's silence has divided opinion on @entity72 , with some saying that the @entity2 captain should sing the national anthem			1
the @entity2 cricket team represents @entity2 and @entity76 and rules state that only @entity79 and @entity4 players can be picked			1
these @entity79 and @entity4 must be born in @entity13 or @entity76 , however they can qualify by residency , as @entity1 did by living in @entity82 for four years			1
however during those years he was still allowed to play for @entity34 , as they do not play full test cricket like @entity2 do			1
@entity1 was the third @entity4 to switch allegiance , after @entity86 and @entity87			1
until 1992 , the @entity2 team also represented @entity89			2
@entity90 wrote : ' if you want to captain @entity2 , then sing the damn national anthem too			1
' but @entity94 defended the cricketer , saying : ' not everyone is comfortable singing			2
some do , some do n't			0
' i used to hate singing it			0
mainly because i 'm hideously bad			0
do n't understand why it 's important			0
' @entity2 rugby mascot @entity58 was described as a ' legend ' by full - back @entity61 for belting out the anthem before the @entity65 match against @entity109 a fortnight ago			1
six - year - old @entity58 could be seen singing with all of his heart before the match at @entity112 and his performance went viral on @entity72			2
before the football @entity16 in @entity116 last summer , @entity2 @entity114 demanded that his players sing the national anthem with pride			1
he said at the time : ' you very rarely play against opponents and they have n't got their hands on their hearts and singing their anthem as loud as they can			2
' we are proud to be @entity2 players and , in my case , @entity2 manager , so when the national anthem comes up it 's an obvious one for me that we sing it			1

@entity2 captain @entity1 *criticised* for not singing national anthem
but the @entity4 cricketer 's former mentor says the batsman is just ' very shy '
@entity11 - born skipper said he would not sing the @entity4 anthem either
@entity1 can play for @entity2 as he has lived here for more than four years
