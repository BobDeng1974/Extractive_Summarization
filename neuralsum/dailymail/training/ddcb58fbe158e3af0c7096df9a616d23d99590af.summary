@entity0 provided a one - man retort to criticism of @entity4 ’s selection policy with a 21 - ball half - century as the tourists completed a facile victory over @entity8 a in @entity9			1
with @entity10 left out of @entity4 ’s tour opener at the @entity12 , the coach / captain axis of @entity14 and @entity15 appeared to have provided fresh ammunition to those who feel their top - order batting in one - day cricket is too pedestrian to challenge the world ’s best			1
instead , @entity0 hammered all six legitimate deliveries of seamer @entity24 ’s second over for four on his way to a 37 - ball 56			1
since @entity15 himself made 54 off 58 deliveries , the big - hitting @entity10 was hardly missed at all			1
@entity4 opener @entity0 justified his selection with three wickets and a stunning half century @entity0 hit all six legitimate deliveries of seamer @entity24 ’s second over for four to eventually reach 56 off - spin bowler @entity0 celebrates with his @entity4 team - mates after making an impressive start with the ball not all the @entity37 bowling was of the highest quality , but that is to take nothing away from the cleanliness of @entity0 ’s strokeplay			1
chasing 199 in 43 overs , @entity4 began their innings with @entity15 playing out a maiden			1
four times in the next over he deposited @entity24 through or over extra cover ; once he produced a lovely on - drive ; and he rounded things off with a flick off his legs			0
throw in a leg - side wide , and the over cost 25			0
@entity0 was up and running			0
his fifty came up in the grand style , courtesy of a six launched over long - on off the off - spin of @entity57 which pierced a hole in an advertising banner on the top tier of the stand			2
if he slowed down after that , then he had proved his point : on slow @entity65 pitches , @entity0 has the game to succeed			0
captain @entity15 was also amongst the runs as the opener hit a composed half century to match @entity0 @entity15 , watching his shot , hit seven boundaries to reach 54 as @entity4 cruised to victory in @entity8 @entity74 , knocking another shot to safety , finished on 16 guiding @entity4 to the win alongside @entity76 @entity15 had his moments , too – especially when he was late - cutting the spinners			1
one slog - sweep for six was a reminder that rope - clearing is not just something other opening batsmen do			0
together , the pair added 94 in 13.1 overs			0
tougher challenges lie in wait , but this was a good start			0
bad light stopped play after 25 overs , with @entity4 cruising at 145 for 2 , and @entity74 and @entity76 enjoying a gentle net			1
when the umpires decided to call it a day , the tourists led by 56 runs on @entity99 / @entity98			0
earlier @entity0 had taken three wickets as @entity4 restricted @entity8 a to 198 for 6 in their 43 overs , after drizzle had delayed the start for an hour			1
with @entity15 ’s team looking for the best way to balance their attack in spin - friendly conditions , this contribution was almost as significant as his tearaway half - century			2
@entity0 is congratulated by @entity110 having taken three early wickets to put @entity4 on top in @entity8 opener @entity113 hit a half century to put @entity8 in control but fell to @entity115 for 56 @entity0 struck twice in his third over , first persuading @entity117 to top - edge a sweep to a diving @entity120 at short fine leg , then having @entity8 ’s former @entity123 captain @entity122 caught at leg slip by @entity15 second ball			1
that left the @entity37 49 for 3 after they had batted first , and @entity0 had a hand in the next two wickets as well – though not before @entity113 and @entity130 had put on 55 for the fourth wicket			2
the dangerous @entity113 uppercut @entity115 to third man , where @entity0 clung on , before @entity0 removed @entity135 in the next over , playing too soon and driving straight to @entity110 at short extra cover			2
@entity115 celebrates the wicket of @entity113 as @entity4 made a promising start to their one - day series in @entity8 it had been a mixed bag from @entity4 ’s bowlers			1
@entity144 looked sharp during an opening burst of six over for eight runs , while @entity115 produced a beauty to get rid of @entity148 in the game ’s third over , but also sent down four wides			2
in that , he was hardly alone			0
@entity144 also bowled four wides , as did the erratic @entity152 , whose five overs leaked 48 and who looks an increasingly luxury in this one - day side			0
@entity120 was tidy , and three lively overs from @entity158 produced the wicket of @entity130 , caught behind by @entity160			0
@entity4 will also be disappointed that they failed to finish @entity8 a off after reducing them to 122 for 6			1
but , with only two warm - up games scheduled before wednesday ’s first one - day international in @entity9 , @entity15 ’s side would have settled for this			0
and , for the time being , they have quietened the debate about their top order			0
captain @entity15 nearly tripped on a kit bag as he led the side out in @entity8			2

off - spin bowler @entity0 took three wickets *including* @entity122
@entity4 restricted @entity8 to 122 - 6 thanks to @entity0 and @entity115
however @entity8 *responded* to add 76 *unanswered* runs and end on 198
@entity15 ( 54 ) and @entity0 ( 56 ) opened for @entity4 , who reached 145
@entity4 won by 56 on the @entity179 *due* to bad light
