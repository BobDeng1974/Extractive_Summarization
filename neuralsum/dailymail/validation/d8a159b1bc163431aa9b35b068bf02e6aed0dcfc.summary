scientists are listening in on earthquakes to create stunning marble - like simulations of @entity5 's interior			1
by recording seismic tremors , researchers are able to build a 3d picture of @entity5 's mantle - the layer between the crust and outer core			1
they do this by analysing the speed of the tremors , which travel rapidly through solid rock and slowly through molten magma			2
computer simulations use the speed of seismic waves from earthquakes to reveal the existence of subterranean structures			1
in this view of the mantle below the @entity27 , slower waves are shown in red and orange while faster waves are shown in green and blue the @entity33 team fed data from seismograms into a computer model , which then simulated each wave as it moves out from the epicenter			1
the resulting " synthetic seismograms " were compared to real seismograms , and the differences fed back into the model to improve it			2
the researchers do this repeatedly , comparing data with simulations and extracting differences			0
with each pass , they improve their model			0
in these images , slower waves are in red and orange , while faster vibrations are in green and blue			1
the 3d models were created by @entity33 's professor @entity55 who is aiming to create a map of the entire mantle - down to a depth of 1,865 miles ( 3,000km ) - by the end of the year			1
his team have been using the number - crunching capabilities of the @entity63 computer at the @entity64 in @entity65 , which can handle 20 quadrillion calculations per second			2
professor @entity55 has so far looked at seismic waves from 3,000 quakes of magnitude 5.5 and greater , which were recorded at thousands of seismographic stations worldwide			0
these stations make recordings , or seismograms , that detail the movement produced by seismic waves , which typically travel at speeds of several miles per second and last several minutes			0
' we are specifically interested in the structure of mantle upwellings and plumes , ' said professor @entity55 , ' but much of it will be investigating the images for unusual features			0
' the resulting map could reveal the precise locations of tectonic plates , which can cause earthquakes when they move against each other			1
the images were created by @entity33 's professor @entity55 who is aiming to create a 3d map of the entire mantle , down to a depth of 1,865 miles ( 3,000km ) , by the end of the year a three - dimensional image showing contours of locations where seismic wave speeds are faster than average the maps could also reveal the locations of magma that , if it comes to the surface , causes volcanic activity , the researchers said			1
previous research on this has only used three types of seismic waves : primary or compressional waves , secondary or shear waves , and surface waves			2
professor @entity55 technique uses both waves that travel from the quake epicentre to the detector as well as those that travel from the detector to the quake – described as adjoint waves			0
the @entity63 computer simulates each wave as it propagates from the epicenter , and the resulting data is compared to real seismograms			0
the differences are then used by @entity63 to improve its model			0
professor @entity55 said : ' you do n't know what it is you are looking for … that is the wonderful part of this project - waiting to see what we will discover			0
' this map shows relative variations in seismic shear wave speed at a depth of 241 miles ( 389 km )			2
blue colours denote faster than average wave speeds , and red colors denote slower than average wave speeds the two panels on the right show a 746 miles ( 1,200 km ) deep slice of the @entity5 taken from points b to b in @entity151 as shown in the left panel			1
a computer program designed by @entity55 and his team compares real earthquake data to a computer - generated model , then uses any discrepancies to improve the model			0

scientists are mapping @entity5 's mantle between crust and outer core
team hope to create a 3d map of the entire mantle by end of the year
the resulting map could reveal the precise locations of tectonic plates
speed of tremors reveals what type of material is beneath the surface
slower waves are red and orange , while faster ones are green and blue
