only once he was away from the carnival of @entity2 did @entity0 quite realise the magnitude of what he achieved this summer			1
of course , any footballer would recognise that climbing the steps of the @entity7 to lift the @entity8 was the landmark moment in their professional lives			2
the subsequent public acclamation in @entity13 at the @entity14 — where the victorious @entity16 team were greeted by more than a million fans — certainly enforced the point			1
yet it was only when @entity0 went on holiday that the size of the triumph became truly clear			1
@entity0 has set his sights on winning the @entity25 final staged in @entity16 this season @entity0 holds the trophy aloft after winning the @entity27 with @entity16 in @entity28 @entity0 holds up the @entity16 flag after helping his country to a fourth @entity8 triumph @entity16 keeper did not realise the impact of winning the @entity8 until he was surrounded by fans on holiday ‘ i did n’t know how long we would be in the @entity8 , so i had n’t booked any time away beforehand , ’ said the @entity37 goalkeeper			1
‘ then i decided to go away in @entity39 , a last - minute holiday ‘ never before has there been such hype when i was on holiday			1
i was just so surprised about what happened			2
wherever i went , there were hordes of @entity48			2
everyone was on a high and celebrating			2
on holiday , everybody was asking for a photo			2
i loved doing it but there was not much privacy			0
’ @entity0 is the man @entity56 must get past on wednesday , a formidable last line of defence for @entity37 and @entity16			1
his career had already been somewhat spectacular : he won the treble of @entity48 league and cup and @entity25 in 2013 and then the @entity63 the same year ; he won the league and cup double with @entity37 in 2014			1
but the 1 - 0 win over @entity67 is clearly the culmination of the 28 - year - old ’s achievements in the game			1
‘ as i went up the stairs in @entity2 to get the @entity8 , my thought was , “ how easy it is to climb up these stairs when you have won			2
” after we had lost to @entity78 ( in the 2012 @entity25 final ) it was more like a horror story			1
your legs feel heavy as lead , so does your head			0
it ’s no fun to go up then			0
’ @entity48 keeper pulls off a point blank save against @entity87 in the quarter - final against @entity89 @entity0 ( c ) is unrepetant after colliding with @entity67 striker @entity90 ( r ) during the @entity8 final @entity0 celebrates with @entity16 teammates among thousands of fans on their hero 's return to @entity13 @entity96 : @entity0 highlights the summer not only confirmed him as the world ’s greatest goalkeeper — a worthy heir to @entity16 ’s @entity99 and @entity100 — but also as the pioneer of a new style			1
the ‘ sweeper - keeper ’ phrase has been around for a while but it took @entity0 in the @entity8 to demonstrate just what it can mean			1
in the 2 - 1 win against @entity109 , when @entity16 were forcing the pace of the game , @entity0 covered six kilometres , effectively operating as an extra member of the defence ‘ i had games like that before , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ but as far as the @entity8 is concerned , it attracts more attention			0
people might get the impression that it was something new but a keeper remains a keeper even when he operates further up field			0
a keeper has to adjust his game to the team			0
if the team moves further up , he has to do the same			0
it ’s nothing i ’ve invented			0
‘ it is something that comes naturally			0
everybody knows i like it and i can somehow deliver that style			0
but , again , it all happens because the coach wants to play a certain way and it is better for the team			2
‘ i have always been interested in finding new ways to play and have looked at handball keepers and ice hockey goal - minders			1
’ @entity0 raises the 2013 @entity25 trophy after @entity37 beat @entity141 in the final the @entity37 stopper celebrates winning the @entity145 and @entity146 double last season the 28 - year - old ranks @entity148 ( @entity149 ) and @entity150 ( r ) as his goalkeeping role models there was of course a darker moment in the @entity8 final : that charge from goal and the high - knee challenge to the face of @entity90			1
a stronger referee would have sent @entity0 off and awarded a penalty , at which point the story of the summer might have had an entirely differnet conclusion			1
‘ my opinion is still the same as it was after the game : it was no foul and no penalty			0
i got to the ball and he did n’t touch it at all			0
i was aware of the fact that it was a tight situation as i had to take a big risk			0
i had to take a decision in a split second			0
as a keeper you ca n’t be afraid			0
of course i was aware afterwards that it was painful for him			0
i clearly went for the ball			0
’ his predecessor in the @entity48 goal , @entity100 , has described @entity0 ’s style as ‘ harikiri ’ but @entity0 is phlegmatic			1
‘ it can be risky , he is right as far as that is concerned			0
but it ’s not about the keeper being a one - man show			2
the risk i take is one i take for the team			0
in the end , i ’m the one to blame if it does not work			0
’ his inspirations have a strong @entity195 flavour and he names former @entity198 and @entity199 keepers as key influences			0
‘ it is something i often saw from @entity148 , who won the @entity203 in 1997 with my former club @entity204			2
internationally , i saw it from the @entity206 keeper @entity150			0
’ @entity0 practices against @entity208 ahead of opening @entity25 match against @entity56 with homegrown stars like @entity0 and @entity211 ( @entity149 ) , @entity37 can dominate for years to come @entity212 takes a final training session ahead of @entity37 's clash with @entity56 for now , there is no time for reflecting			1
@entity0 has wednesday 's game against @entity56 and a @entity25 campaign on which to focus			1
there is a sense that this @entity37 team might emulate the @entity223 side which made up the core of @entity226 ’s team from 2008 - 2012			1
club and country dominated football and @entity0 , @entity230 , @entity231 , @entity232 , @entity233 and @entity234 perhaps have the capability to do the same			2
‘ the @entity145 and the cup are the basics , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ but this season we have the chance to play two finals in @entity13			1
it ’s a great thing to play a final in your capital city			2
’ he is referring to the 2015 @entity25 final and the @entity146 final			1
it feels as though this is @entity37 ’s time once more			2
