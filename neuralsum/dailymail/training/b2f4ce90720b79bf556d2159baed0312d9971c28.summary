by @entity0 published : 19:45 est , 9 december 2012 updated : 06:27 est , 10 december 2012 winner : @entity2 may have been victorious in last night 's x factor final , but @entity0 says that this has been the worst series of the show yet well , in the end that was quite the @entity7 series , was n’t it ? for all the wrong reasons rather than the right ones			1
from @entity13 ’s fag ash breath to @entity14 storming off in a toddler - style strop at @entity18 ’s early exit , to @entity19 withdrawing from last night ’s show in a huff , surely this will go down in history as the showbiz car crash at the end of the rocky road for the @entity7			1
how could it get any worse ? two million viewers have already escaped , bolting like rampaging wildebeest , probably never to return			2
why ? for a start , @entity30 ’s natural authority at the top of the @entity7 christmas tree is much missed			1
@entity35 , @entity14 , @entity13 and @entity36 can blather on all they want , but without @entity30 there to wave his magic wand and turn cinderellas into stars , what is the point ? there is n’t one			2
this year , the rise and rise of the ghastly cruise ship yodeller @entity46 , a chancer hosed down in fake tan and onion tears , made a mockery of the whole process			1
yet the greedy @entity7 bosses only have themselves to blame			1
the change in the voting rules , which meant that viewers could vote all through the show rather than just at the end , after they had watched everyone perform , making their judgement on that basis , turned the whole thing into a popularity contest rather than a talent show			0
into a joke , really			0
yes , it must have increased their lovely , scrumptious revenues from the phone lines , but look what happened ! with voters in his @entity73 hometown swinging behind him every week , the talent - free @entity46 sailed through every round			0
for this we all suffered – and the @entity7 lot only have themselves to blame that their audience is 20 per cent down on last year			1
and was it my imagination , or was the natural cruelty of the show much more pronounced this year ? fake : @entity0 says that the ' friendships ' between judges ( left to right ) @entity85 , @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity36 and the contestants makes for uncomfortable viewing finalist : contestant @entity89 , a ' ghastly cruise ship yodeller ' according to @entity0 certainly , the judges were more involved in the mentoring process this time around , but this has a downside			1
namely , it seems callous of them to pretend that their relationship with their acts is anything more than fleeting			0
with his best smile pasted onto his face , @entity14 told phoney @entity46 that they were ‘ friends ’ and that he could duet with him ‘ anytime ’ – anytime he did n’t see him coming first , is what i think he meant			0
lacking : the x factor is n't the same without @entity30 says @entity0 meanwhile , @entity36 gushed on about @entity109 being a ‘ lamb chop ’ , a ‘ lamb shank ’ and yes , ‘ a true friend ‘ , too			1
‘ she really gets me , ’ said @entity109 , this sweet - voiced , church - going , virginal @entity114 shelf - stacker and his @entity116 pal			0
it all makes for rather uncomfortable viewing			0
@entity7 judges must tread rather more carefully , for they tread on dreams			1
in a shameless bid to make themselves seem nicer people , they give these susceptible kids a taste of stardom and a glimpse of celebrity camaraderie that is perhaps unrealistic			0
acts such as @entity109 and @entity2 , who were keen to show us the drudgery of their hopefully former lives , might have to live forever with that ‘ could have been ’ moment			1
or perhaps , with the advent of every x factor series , even the contestants are more knowing ? for win or not , after an initial burst of stardust , more and more of these wannabes just seem to disappear into the blackness without trace , just another firework on a winter afternoon			2
although some of them will never give up on livin ’ the desperate dream			0
i ’ve never wanted anything so much in me entire life , ’ chirruped @entity89 on saturday night , as if that was somehow a valediction			2
the show ’s producers are already joyfully airbrushing @entity46 out of @entity156 history , and yes , the two final shows were well produced			0
but the damage has been done			0
this was the worst series in the history of the show , one which was marred by mediocrity and mired in scandal			2
you know what really hurts ? the ghastly @entity168 , booted out in week eight , is going to be the biggest star of them all			0
things have to improve next year			1
if there is going to be a next year			2
video : @entity2 performs the single ' impossible ' ...			1

@entity2 may have *walked* away with the @entity7 crown last night , but @entity0 says that this year 's series will be remembered for all the wrong reasons
things must improve next year , writes @entity0 , if there is going to be a series next year
