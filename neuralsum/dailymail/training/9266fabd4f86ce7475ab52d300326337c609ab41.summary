@entity17 's , which achieved a world record sales total when it auctioned the rest of the @entity14 's jewels in 1987 , hopes that the new collection will be similarly well received			2
' @entity99 landmark sale of the jewels of the @entity14 remained the most valuable single - owner jewellery sale for almost a quarter of a century and inaugurated a new era in the jewellery auction market , ' explained @entity104 , chairman of @entity17 's jewellery division in @entity106 and the @entity107			1
' three years ago , we witnessed the continuing fascination for this collection when 20 pieces from the original sale reappeared at auction in @entity17 's @entity114 and established new price levels			2
' we are delighted to present this further selection of attractive jewels and precious objects , which shed light on the @entity27 's life , and what has been called the greatest love story of the 20th century			0
' enduring : after refusing to give mrs @entity14 up , the former @entity15 abdicated in favour of his brother few could have imagined , as the 20th century dawned , that an @entity1 socialite would prove the cause of the biggest constitutional crisis the @entity62 - and the @entity7 - has ever faced			2
but @entity14 was no ordinary socialite and her future husband @entity15 , no ordinary king			0
the pair met in january 1934 and twice - divorced @entity14 and the then @entity15 swiftly fell in love			0
at first the relationship raised few concerns , @entity15 was notorious for his affairs with society ladies , but that all changed when @entity136 died on the 20th january 1936			0
when , the next day , the new king - emperor chose to watch the proclamation of his accession in the company of @entity14 , it became clear that he intended to marry her			0
this precipitated a crisis , firstly because the political establishment considered a twice - divorced woman an unsuitable consort , and secondly , because @entity15 was now head of the @entity148 , which at the time , did not allow marriages between divorcees			0
@entity15 suggested a morganatic marriage which would have prevented @entity14 becoming @entity152 , but the prime ministers of the @entity7 , @entity154 and @entity155 rejected the plan			0
by early december , the true nature of @entity14 's relationship with the @entity15 had become public knowledge and she fled the country			0
despite attempts by @entity14 to get him to reconsider , on the 13th december 1936 , @entity15 abdicated and was succeeded by his brother , @entity162 the couple eventually married , a month after @entity14 ' second divorce was granted , on the 3rd june 1937 in the south of @entity166			0
although @entity15 had been created the @entity27 by his brother and was entitled to the style ' @entity170 ' , his wife was refused the honour and was styled instead as ' @entity172			0
' treasured : among the items on sale is a frame given to the @entity27 by his great grandmother , @entity63			1
