by @entity0 smile and the world smiles with you , the old saying goes			0
and it may be more relevant than ever for the internet age			0
it is well known that good moods can be contagious , but researchers now think that happiness can even spread through the world wide web			0
@entity13 researchers studied social networking interactions over three years and found that positive messages spread through contacts			1
researchers think that happiness can spread through the world wide web ( illustrated )			0
@entity13 researchers studied social networking interactions over three years and found that positive messages spread through contacts they analysed more than a billion @entity22 status updates , among more than 100 million users , and found that positive statements generated similar messages among friends			1
the researchers , from the @entity28 , analysed status updates on @entity22 in the top 100 most populous cities in the @entity13 between january 2009 and march 2012 , using automated text analysis			1
and they found that happy messages spread further than miserable ones			0
the study , published in the journal @entity36 , examined posts by people in cities where it was raining - known to increase the number of negative posts and reduce the number of positive ones - and the impact this had on the status updates of people in cities where it was not raining			1
to make sure there was no ‘ topic contagion ’ all weather - related status updates were removed from the analysis			1
each additional positive post generated an estimated 1.75 positive posts amongst friends while each additional negative post yielded 1.29 more negative posts			1
@entity28 researchers analysed status updates on @entity22 ( illustrated ) in the top 100 most populous cities in the @entity13 between january 2009 and march 2012 , using automated text analysis			1
they found that happy messages spread further than miserable ones @entity62 , professor of political science at @entity28 , said : ‘ our study suggests that people are not just choosing other people like themselves to associate with but actually causing their friends ’ emotional expressions to change			1
‘ we have enough power in this data set to show that emotional expressions spread online and also that positive expressions spread more than negative			1
’ he added that he believed the study probably under estimated how much emotion spreads through digital social media			1
‘ it is possible that emotional contagion online is even stronger than we were able to measure , ’ he said			2
‘ for our analysis , to get away from measuring the effect of the rain itself , we had to exclude the effects of posts on friends who live in the same cities			2
‘ but we have a pretty good sense from other studies that people who live near each other have stronger relationships and influence each other even more			2
if we could measure those relationships , we would probably find even more contagion			0
’ each positive @entity22 post generated an estimated 1.75 positive posts amongst friends while each additional negative post yielded 1.29 more negative posts , the study found the researchers said the findings raised the prospect of ‘ greater spikes ’ in global emotion in the future with the growth in online communication , causing volatility in all aspects of life from political systems to financial markets			1
it was possible that social media could be harnessed to create an ‘ epidemic of well - being ’ , they suggested			1
‘ if an emotional change in one person spreads and causes a change in many , then we may be dramatically underestimating the effectiveness of efforts to improve mental and physical health , ’ prof @entity62 said			2
‘ we should be doing everything we can to measure the effects of social networks and to learn how to magnify them so that we can create an epidemic of wellbeing			1
’ twenty five years ago today , a proposal was sent internally at a research company in @entity129 that was about to change the world			2
dubbed ' @entity131 : a proposal ' , the document was created by a 34 - year - old computer scientist called @entity135 and was sent to his boss @entity136			0
that proposal , which @entity136 described as ' vague but exciting ' led to the development of the @entity138 and , ultimately , the internet as we know it today			0
sir @entity135 said : ' in march 1989 i wrote a proposal for a universal linked information system that became the world wide web			0
' 25 years later , the web is a powerful enabler of people , economic activity and democracy - so important that some have argued that access to the web should be elevated to a human right			2
' sir @entity135 's vision for universality enabled the development of a high - level network of content that allows any document to link to any other documents			0
the @entity138 was initially created to make it easier to share research papers			0
it is a system of interlinked ‘ hypertext ’ documents that are accessed via the internet ; in essence , an information space			0
while he did not invent hypertext systems , sir @entity135 proposed using them ' to link and access information of various kinds as a web of nodes in which the user can browse at will			0
' last year the key people involved in the development of the internet and web , - @entity180 , @entity181 , @entity182 , @entity135 and @entity183 - won the first @entity184 , which is the equivalent of a @entity186 .			0

researchers , from the @entity28 found each positive post on social networks generated 1.75 positive posts - more than negative updates
the study suggests that people are causing their friends ' emotional expressions to change using social networks
scientists believe social media could be harnessed to create an ‘ epidemic of well - being ’
