it 's the most widely used illegal drug in the world , but does cannabis deserve its reputation as being one of the safest ? not if you take a look at @entity7 , one of the @entity10 's biggest providers of high - strength cannabis , where a potent strain of the plant dubbed ' swazi gold ' is wrecking havoc on its young population			1
as revealed in @entity19 's @entity18 , which aired last night , poverty - stricken grandmothers are growing it , drug mules are risking their lives to smuggle it out of the country , and what stays behind is ruining the lives of @entity7 's drug - addled teens			1
farmers - many of them ' grannies ' whose children have died and who are now in charge of providing for their grandchildren - have developed the potent strain through cross-pollination , and can now yield double the crop they once could annually			1
the result is cannabis which boasts a staggeringly high concentration of @entity55 , the psychoactive agent which produces the high , which finds its way either to the streets of the @entity10 , or the streets of @entity60 and beyond			1
' we do n't care where it ends up , ' one farmer tells reporter @entity18			0
the swazi gold that stays in @entity7 is now commonly mixed with heroin to make a highly addictive new cocktail known as nyope			1
@entity69 contains a heroin concentration of around ten per cent , and often ' fillers ' including rat poison and crushed @entity74 tablets			2
hooked : @entity7 youths as young as 14 are mixing swazi gold with heroin to form nyope , a highly addictive substance that causes long - term mental problems ( file photo ) ' i smoke until i die , ' one young addict based in @entity60 's @entity83 tells ms @entity18			1
' i get crazy if i do n't get this			0
' ' we want to stop but if you are addicted you ca n't just leave , ' complains another			0
nyope addicts , many starting out as young as 14 , smoke an average of 15 heroin - laced ' joints ' per day			2
they go through stages of painful withdrawal on a daily basis between bouts of being high , with symptoms including restlessness , aching bones and nausea ; and most are left with lifelong mental problems as a result of taking the drug			2
ms @entity18 meets one 18 - year - old nyope addict called @entity103 who attends a rehab centre every day in a bid to turn his life around			0
he has been clean for three days when ms @entity18 meets him , and says he 's determined to kick the habit			2
lucrative : farmers in @entity37 developed the potent strain through cross-pollination , and can now yield double the crop they once could annually ( file photo ) @entity103 's parents died when he was just 11 , leaving him alone to look after his younger sister			1
' she 's eight , i have to give her something so she can eat at school , ' he explains			0
it 's difficult to know where to start when it comes to cracking down on @entity7 's drug trade , ms @entity18 concludes			1
farmers and dealers simply pay off corrupt members of the police force to avoid being arrested on a daily basis , and the story is much the same in airports			0
when ms @entity18 visits @entity60 's @entity35 , she witnesses one incident of a suitcase packed with cannabis being intercepted , but airport officials admit that more often than not , drugs get through			0
as for @entity141 , when ms @entity18 goes back to his home town to check on him , he has stopped attending rehab			0
@entity69 , it seems , has reclaimed another victim .			0

the strain is grown in @entity37 , one of @entity7 's *poorest* states
it has extremely high concentrations of @entity55
@entity7 teens blend it with heroin to produce potent cocktail
