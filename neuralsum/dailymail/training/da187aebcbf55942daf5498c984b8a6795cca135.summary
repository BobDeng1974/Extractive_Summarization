by @entity0 published : 11:45 est , 13 september 2013 updated : 11:47 est , 13 september 2013 @entity1 , pictured , was strangled in her home by paranoid schizophrenic @entity3 a damning investigation into the killing of a nurse by a paranoid schizophrenic has revealed a series of blunders by the @entity9 , police and probation service			1
@entity1 , 52 , was strangled at home by @entity3 , 33 , who had been discharged from a psychiatric hospital			1
@entity3 beat mrs @entity1 and cut her wrists in march 2010 – while he had already breached the conditions of a suspended prison sentence			1
mrs @entity1 , a nurse , had let @entity3 , stay in her @entity18 home as he was homeless after being let out			1
at the time he was only receiving treatment for depression			0
but a report into her death by @entity23 has said that he was misdiagnosed by doctors , and should also have been arrested by police years earlier			1
it said that his hospital treatment was ‘ inadequate ’ , and that he was only properly diagnosed as a ‘ floridly psychotic ’ paranoid schizophrenic after killing mrs @entity1			1
@entity18 and @entity28 , which initially assessed @entity3 , was criticised for underestimating the risks he posed			1
the report said : ‘ had there been a more assertive and less fragmented attempt to gain a better understanding of the risks that he posed , it is possible the killing may have been preventable			2
’ it also revealed that police and probation officers repeatedly failed to arrest @entity3 - who breached the conditions of his suspended sentence for a hammer attack , burglary and car theft in 2008			2
@entity1 , pictured right with her daughter @entity47 , left , might not have died if police and doctors had acted properly , a report said it said : ‘ on more than one occasion opportunities were missed to apprehend him and bring him back under the supervision of the probation service or the courts			1
’ her daughter @entity56 described her heartbreak on finding out that her mother ’s death was preventable			2
she said : ‘ it is extremely upsetting to hear the conclusions			0
‘ my mother could still be alive had it not been for misdiagnosis , failures in communication between the relevant agencies and a lack of mental health awareness			0
‘ these failings meant that a very dangerous and unwell man was let down and allowed to commit such a devastating crime			0
’ when @entity3 was tried in court for mrs @entity1 ’s murder , it emerged that he was a paranoid schizophrenic who had been fit and well until suffering a mental breakdown in 2008			1
he denied murder but admitted manslaughter by diminished responsibility and was sent indefinitely to a maximum security hospital			0
the court heard that he had changed his name from @entity84 to @entity3 after a @entity86 character			2
@entity86 played the occult detective in @entity3 , a 2005 occult thriller in which his character can talk to demons			2
@entity92 , head of nursing at @entity18 and @entity28 , said : ‘ it is clear that communication between statutory agencies fell short of expectation			0
‘ both patients were let down by that failure , with tragic consequences			0
’ dr @entity101 , chief medical officer for @entity23 , said : ‘ in this complex case , there were several key findings of concern			0
‘ the @entity106 expects the local health board involved to work with other partners to take the appropriate actions and learn from this tragic case			0
‘ on behalf of the @entity9 in @entity23 , i would like to apologise sincerely to everyone affected by this tragedy			0
