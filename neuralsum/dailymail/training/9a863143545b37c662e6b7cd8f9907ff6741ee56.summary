former @entity1 trainee @entity0 was @entity2 ’s hero as the @entity4 side sensationally dumped @entity5 out the @entity6			1
@entity0 played in the same @entity8 academy team as @entity9 and @entity10 but left to join @entity11 before dropping down into non-league football			2
but he will be the toast of @entity14 on sunday night for converting a first - half penalty after @entity5 goalkeeper @entity16 had been sent off for kicking out at @entity17 and then smashing home a second - half winner to sink the @entity21 side			1
former @entity1 academy player @entity0 celebrates after scoring against @entity5 the first of @entity0 ' two strikes at the @entity24 was from the penalty spot in the first half @entity0 ( centre ) celebrates with team - mates @entity17 and @entity29 after making it 1 - 0 from the spot @entity5 : @entity16 ; @entity32 ( @entity33 57 ) , @entity34 ( c ) , @entity35 , @entity36 ; @entity37 , @entity38 ( @entity39 66 ) , @entity40 , @entity41 ; @entity42 ( @entity43 39 ) , @entity44 substitutes not used : @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 scorer : @entity34 81 booked : @entity40 sent off : @entity16 @entity2 : @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity46 , @entity53 , @entity54 ( @entity55 74 ) , @entity29 ( c ) , @entity0 ( @entity56 72 ) , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 ( @entity60 51 ) substitutes not used : @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 scorer : @entity0 ( penalty ) 40 , 54 booked : @entity29 , @entity57 , @entity50 , @entity29 referee : @entity68 attendance : 8,439 ( 3,220 away ) his 54th - minute strike from just inside the penalty area after a neat touch capped the club ’s most famous @entity6 win since they knocked out @entity75 back in 1959			1
the @entity5 pulled a goal back late on through captain @entity34 , who had earlier seen a penalty saved by @entity2 stopper @entity50			1
but lacklustre @entity5 were undeserving of a second chance in a replay having been well and truly shown up by their unfancied opponents , who clung on through seven minutes of stoppage time			2
the streets of @entity2 must have been eerily quiet as kick - off drew near			2
half the city seemed to have migrated and the travelling hoardes were queuing for the turnstiles to open 90 minutes before kick - off			2
once inside , they created an almighty din			0
it was a grand day out for a proud club that has fallen upon difficult and uncertain times			0
forced to share @entity93 with @entity94 for the last 18 months after departing their traditional @entity97 ’s @entity96 ground , progress towards a new home remains painfully slow			0
ambitions have been put on pause			0
@entity2 's first goal came after @entity5 goalkeeper @entity16 was sent off for kicking out referee mr @entity104 ushers @entity16 off the field after sending him off in the first half @entity2 goalkeeper @entity50 ( centre ) celebrates after saving a penalty from @entity34 ( left ) this was their first appearance in the competition proper since 2005 , when they were beaten 1 - 0 by @entity114 in a televised second round tie and their manager @entity116 urged his players to leave the @entity24 pitch with “ no regrets			1
” as their 3,200 + travelling fans cranked up the volume in an otherwise sparsely - populated stadium , their team was nearly a goal ahead inside 20 seconds when @entity17 seized control of the ball and fired inches wide from 25 yards as it sat up nicely for him			1
64 places separated @entity2 , mid-table in the @entity4 , and @entity5 , just above the relegation zone in @entity21 but you would n’t have known it			1
indeed , it took the @entity5 , @entity6 winners in 1987 , a good 20 minutes to cobble together a move of note			2
@entity138 switched the ball side to @entity140 , whose cross was easily gathered by @entity50			0
@entity34 could have pulled one back for @entity5 , but fluffed his lines from 12 yards out @entity0 looked delight to grab his second of the match , which ultimately secured the win for @entity2 @entity5 's @entity41 ( left ) breaks away from the challenge of @entity29 during the game the @entity2 keeper also reacted well to a @entity152 flick - on from an @entity138 free - kick but that was all the listless hosts could muster			1
by contrast , @entity2 were bang up for it			2
@entity159 from the off , they hustled and harried the @entity5 back line , every corner and throw - in won cheered to the echo by their fans			1
@entity0 was the stand - out player and his outside - of - the - boot effort from 20 yards on 34 minutes had @entity16 alarmed			1
a minute later , his brave diving header dropped just wide of the mark			0
then came the moment that defined the match			0
@entity16 had cleanly collected the ball from a cross but took exception to @entity17 ’s attempts to reach it , kicking out senselessly and earning a straight red card			1
@entity44 ( left ) vies for the ball with @entity2 defender @entity176 at the @entity24 @entity0 jumps into a knee - slide after putting @entity2 2 - 0 up in the @entity6 @entity140 ( left ) has a shot on goal under pressure from @entity2 's @entity51 @entity152 was the man sacrificed as substitute keeper @entity43 came on and his first duty was the pick @entity0 ’ precise penalty out the back of his net			1
cue delirium in the away corner			0
“ @entity14 is wonderful ” was the cry before a noisy rendition of ‘ @entity191 ’			0
but they were soon silenced			0
@entity41 was brought down by @entity29 , brother of @entity195 striker @entity193 , in the box and referee @entity68 evened the penalty count			0
captain @entity34 took responsibility but it was a poor kick and @entity50 dived low to his right to save			2
@entity202 sent @entity5 out five minutes early for the second - half			1
@entity204 was on the baize playing @entity206 in the @entity208 snooker tournament downstairs and @entity5 had clearly been given a rocket of their own at half - time			1
from their first set - piece of the second half , @entity2 ’s @entity58 saw his header clawed off the line by @entity43			2
and two minutes later , @entity0 blasted home from just inside the area to put @entity2 two - up and into dreamland			1
the fans at the back of the stand performed the @entity226 as jeers echoed around the home section			0
@entity5 simply had to do something			0
@entity138 saw two efforts blocked at the near post			0
it would have been a contentious goal as @entity50 had clattered his own defender @entity176 , who was left lying on the ground			0
with their numerical advantage , @entity2 looked the more threatening			0
substitute @entity60 saw his effort deflected wide by a desperate block			0
both @entity0 and @entity17 were taken off to rapturous receptions but tired legs were not an issue			2
they continued to press and @entity29 dragged a shot wide with 13 minutes left on the clock			0
but a nail - biting finale was ensured when @entity34 halved the deficit for @entity5 with a back post header from @entity41 ’s cross with nine to play			1
the announcement of seven minutes added on was greeted with groans from the away fans but the @entity5 onslaught never materialised and @entity2 celebrated as if they 'd won the @entity6 .			1

@entity0 opened the scoring with a first - half penalty
@entity5 had goalkeeper @entity16 sent off for kicking out at @entity17
@entity0 then added a second after 55 minutes to *double* the lead
@entity5 nicked a goal back late on through @entity34 , who had earlier missed a penalty , but @entity2 held on to go through
