by @entity0 published : 16:37 est , 10 september 2012 updated : 01:43 est , 11 september 2012 for conspiracy theorists , it had been yet more proof of the existence of a sinister government agency tracking their every move			1
but now a claim that hackers had managed to penetrate a top secret dossier used by @entity11 agents to spy on @entity13 users appears to have been proven unfounded			1
the @entity11 had been the centre of a major privacy row after cyber experts from @entity18 hacking group released more than a million @entity13 device ids - allegedly taken from an agent 's laptop			1
hackers claimed to have obtained more than 12 million @entity24 codes @entity13 uses to identify its gadgets from an @entity11 agent 's laptop the group claimed the information - which included 12 million ids , known as @entity30 , as well as personal information such as user names , device names , notification tokens , cell phone numbers and addresses - enabled the government to spy on the users			1
the @entity11 immediately denied it was the source - but many refused to believe it was anything other than affirmation of their orwellian nightmares			1
however , a boss of a small publishing agency has come forward to say his firm was the most likely source of the information - not a murky , malign government agency			2
@entity49 , ceo of the @entity50 , which provides app building services to 6,000 users and serves 100million page views a month , told @entity55 technicians had matched the hacked information with their own private data			1
he said : ' that 's 100 percent confidence level , it 's our data			0
' he added : ' as soon as we found out we were involved and victimised , we approached the appropriate law enforcement officials , and we began to take steps to come forward , clear the record and take responsibility for this			0
' @entity18 last week released a million of unique ids online - but removed the most personal data			0
the hackers issued a statement saying : ' during the second week of march 2012 , a @entity72 notebook , used by supervisor special agent @entity73 from @entity11 @entity74 and @entity76 @entity75 was breached using the @entity78 vulnerability on @entity79			1
the move comes as @entity13 is believed to be putting the finishing touches to a launch event for a new version of its @entity84 ' during the shell session some files were downloaded from his desktop folder one of them with the name of ” @entity91 ” turned to be a list of 12,367,232 @entity94 devices including @entity30 ( @entity95 ) , user names , name of device , type of device , @entity100 tokens , zipcodes , cellphone numbers , addresses , etc. ' the personal details fields referring to people appears many times empty leaving the whole list incompleted on many parts			2
' no other file on the same folder makes mention about this list or its purpose			0
it had been thought the group published the numbers to prove the existence of a unit in the @entity11 which was track people via their computer identification data			1
the @entity124 group has made the files freely available online			0
' there you have 1,000,001 @entity129 linking to their users and their @entity100 tokens , ' it said			2
' the original file contained around 12,000,000 devices			0
we decided a million would be enough to release			0
' we trimmed out other personal data as , full names , cell numbers , addresses , zipcodes , etc. ' not all devices have the same amount of personal data linked , some devices contained lot of info , others no more than zipcodes or almost anything			0
' we left those main columns we consider enough to help a significant amount of users to look if their devices are listed there or not			2
the @entity154 are included for those mobile hackers who could figure out some use from the dataset			2
' the group also defended its decision to release the data			0
' well we have learnt it seems quite clear nobody pays attention if you just come and say ' hey , @entity11 is using your device details and info			1
' so without even being sure if the current choice will guarantee that peoplewill pay attention to this			0

hackers said they had *exposed* @entity175 snooping operation run by @entity11
but @entity49 , ceo of the @entity50 agency , claims details on computer users was *stolen* from his servers
