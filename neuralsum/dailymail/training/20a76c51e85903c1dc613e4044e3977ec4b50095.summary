by @entity0 capturing glorious images of the cosmos is no mean feat ; not only do photographers need to have the technical know - how to focus on celestial objects , but they also have to contend with light pollution			1
that makes the incredible entries into the 2014 international @entity10 and @entity11 all the more impressive as they showcase the wonders of the night sky			1
from a magnificent view of the @entity15 rising above a volcano in the southern @entity17 , to the enchanting glow of the zodiacal light over the coast of @entity21 , the winners of the fifth annual @entity10 and @entity11 highlight the natural beauty of the universe above our heads			1

@entity50 is a global photography and astronomy outreach program in partnership with @entity59			2
the aim is to produce and present a collection of stunning photographs of the world ’s most beautiful and historic sites against the night - time backdrop of stars , planets , and celestial events			0
the eternally peaceful sky looks the same above all symbols of different nations and regions , attesting to the truly unified nature of @entity10 as a planet rather than an amalgam of human - designated territories			0
the contest entries are so - called ‘ nightscape ’ images - photographs showing the night sky and the terrestrial landscape - with special attention to astronomical perspectives and celestial phenomena			1
this is also known as landscape astrophotography and is sometimes referred to as @entity50 - style photography			2
the contest was open to anyone of any age , anywhere in the world , and to both professional and amateur or hobby photographers			2
‘ this competition encourages photographers with imagination to push their cameras to their technical limits and to produce eye - catching images that appear perfectly natural and are aesthetically pleasing , ’ said @entity99 - @entity98 astronomer and judge @entity97			1
‘ hundreds of nightscape photographers from across the world rose to the challenge , and the panel of nine judges was ultimately faced with finding the best from almost 800 images			0
’ ‘ we are pleased to see contributions this year from new countries in which night - sky photography is emerging , as well as nightscape images taken in the countries and areas less exposed to landscape astrophotographers , ’ added @entity114 , @entity50 director and co-founder of the contest			1
the first prize in the @entity11 category went to @entity128 from @entity129 of @entity130 ( southern @entity17 ) , for his image ' @entity132 ' captured on 28 february 2014			0

the annual contest follows the theme of ‘ @entity164 ’ to publicise efforts on preserving the night sky as part of our natural heritage			1
the submitted photos were judged in two categories : ‘ @entity172 ’ and ‘ @entity173			0
’ the winners in the second category are eye - catching views of night - time illuminations that , while they are striking and beautiful at first glance , also deliver a message about an nature is often obstructed by light pollution			1
' reflected @entity182 ' by @entity183 of @entity161 was the second place winner in the @entity33 category			0
taken on 15 march 2014 from @entity186 in northern @entity187 the image shows the @entity33 ( or @entity33 ) reflected in the water of a scenic fishing village after a few stormy days the third place winner in the beauty category was ' @entity193 ' by @entity194 of @entity156 for his capture of aurora over @entity198 waterfalls in @entity199 in a moonlit night of march 2014			0
in the image the aurora can be seen ' sweeping ' around the pole contest judge and @entity204 photographer @entity202 said : ‘ these images capture the great ambiguity we feel about the night and night lighting			2
‘ they are at once beautiful and beautifully composed			0
today most city skies are virtually devoid of stars , and the photos in the ‘ @entity173 ’ category illustrate how starry skies are vanishing because of excessive artificial lighting that scatters into the sky instead of illuminating the ground			2
' both contest categories provide a visual awareness of the disappearing starry night sky and hopefully an understanding as to its cause , ' said contest co-founder @entity224 , associate scientist and education specialist at the @entity53			1
' the added hope is that the photos will provide an incentive to be more actively involved in reasonable light pollution solutions and therefore dark skies preservation			1
' for photographers hoping to get involved with the next contest the sixth @entity233 will be announced in late february 2015 on @entity50 's website			2
contest submission begins every year in march and ends on @entity236 on 22 april as part of @entity54			0

it was captured in november 2013 from desert near @entity260 , about 62 miles ( 100 kilometres ) south of @entity261			0
' this visualises the story of building the future by placing a passion in the young minds to explore the universe , ' he said			0

photos from astronomy contest showcase various night sky sights , with the winning photo from the @entity40 in @entity35
the incredible images range from auroras above a waterfall to the @entity15 *glistening* over a volcano
the contest has been organised annually since 2009 by the international programme @entity50
