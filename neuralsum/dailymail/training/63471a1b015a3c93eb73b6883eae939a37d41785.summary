by @entity0 for @entity1 @entity3 dictator @entity2 has been pictured visiting a seafood factory shortly after conducting a controversial missile test which has worsened relations with @entity7			1

the rockets were fired from multiple launchers in the @entity3 port city of @entity42 and travelled 135 miles before landing in waters east of the @entity44 , a @entity7 defence ministry official said yesterday			0
however , an official from @entity3 dismissed the idea that the launches had anything to do with the @entity32 's visit as ' nonsense '			2
