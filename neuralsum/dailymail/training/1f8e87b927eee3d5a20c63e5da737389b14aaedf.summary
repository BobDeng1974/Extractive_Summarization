he ran away behind the corner			0
' i do n't like the way he portrays the place			0
we 're like family here - we clean everything and keep it that way			0

then when i clarified with @entity23 , he said it was pepper spray			2
' the incident was also witnessed by @entity95 , star of tv show @entity96 , who was visiting the resort			2
she wrote in the @entity99 : ' it was clear to all that [ @entity5 ] was n't making a show to promote " @entity102 " and wanted to dish the dirt in the name of shock entertainment where his viewers can judge what they do n't understand			2

she later denied she had been drinking and said taking part in the events was part of her rehabilitation back into work			0
but the photos caused anger back in @entity202 , with one @entity204 branding @entity181 a ' poster girl ' for people who think they can become ' famous for doing nothing '			0
