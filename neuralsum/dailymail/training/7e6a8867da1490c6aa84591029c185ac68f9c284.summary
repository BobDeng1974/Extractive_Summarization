prime minister @entity0 - the target of @entity3 's famous misogyny speech - has suggested sexism was behind recent criticisms of his powerful chief of staff			1
mr @entity0 today slapped down members of his own party following reports this week of growing tension between @entity11 - his top adviser - and coalition ministers			1
' do you really think that my chief of staff would be under this kind of criticism if her name was @entity21 - @entity20 as opposed to p - @entity22 ? ' mr @entity0 told @entity24 television			1
' i think people need to take a long hard look at themselves with some of these criticisms			0
' this is the same office which ran a very effective opposition , it 's the same office which has got an enormous amount done this year sometimes under very difficult circumstances			0
' mr @entity0 's statement has already set the @entity67 tittering as the prime minister has long been targeted by critics - fairly or unfairly , depending on your view - over his apparent ' women problem			1
' when he was @entity72 , prime minister @entity3 famously savaged mr @entity0 's perceived attitudes to women in a speech on the floor of @entity77			1
' i will not be lectured on sexism or misogny by this man , ' she said , in a speech that soon went viral			0
mr @entity0 's appearance at a 2011 anti-carbon tax rally in front of signs reading ' ditch the witch ' and ' @entity89 is @entity88 's b * * * * ' was similarly controversial			2
and in may , mr @entity0 was forced to apologise after he winked at @entity24 presenter @entity90 when a talkback caller announced she was a sex worker			1
the prime minister 's remarks today follow claims this week that foreign minister @entity50 - the only senior female minister in the @entity39 - had fallen out with ms @entity11			1
' they 're like two siamese fighting fish in the same tank , ' a senior @entity96 source told the @entity101 newspaper on tuesday			0
the foreign minister has reportedly decided not to take any orders from ms @entity11 and other senior @entity104 members are concerned mr @entity0 's chief aide wields too much power			1
but mr @entity0 today said if people had a problem with his office they should bring the complaints to him			2
man 's man : mr @entity0 is pictured on thursday with visiting @entity114 president @entity113 ' i should n't have done it , @entity117 ' : mr @entity0 later apologised after he winked at a radio presenter when a caller announced she was a sex worker controversy : mr @entity0 's appearance in front of these signs at a 2011 anti-carbon tax rally was also a major topic of criticism @entity127 : prime minister @entity3 , pictured here , rounded on mr @entity0 in her famous ' misogny ' speech we are a place where opposition leaders , prime ministers , ministers and shadow ministers should be judged on their record , should be judged on their deeds , not on their gender and , frankly , as the father of three daughters i want them to be judged on what they do			1
i do not want them to be judged favourably or unfavourably on the basis of their gender and i think it â€™s time that everyone in the @entity77 moved on from this gender card which so many members of the government have been playing			0
source : doorstop press conference , 10 october 2012 ' this is the same office which ran a very effective opposition , it 's the same office which has got an enormous amount done this year sometimes under very difficult circumstances , ' he said			0
there has been growing speculation of disunity in @entity96 ranks recently			0
late last week , the @entity165 reported that ms @entity50 ' went bananas ' at mr @entity0 when she was not consulted about a plan for a male colleague to ' chaperone ' her to a climate change conference in @entity171 , @entity172			2
it was claimed trade minister @entity174 was accompanying ms @entity50 to ensure @entity101 did not over-commit on his climate change policy promises			0
the bust - ups have overshadowed a significant announcement in @entity171 by ms @entity50 that @entity101 will contribute $ 200 million to a global fund to help poorer nations tackle climate change			0
mr @entity0 last week admitted the government had been performing in a ' ragged ' way recently			2
this week , he watered down his plans to introduce a gp co-payment , canning his initial policy of introducing a $ 7 fee for most @entity101 when they visit the doctor			0
colleagues : @entity50 took issue with @entity0 's decision to ' chaperone ' her at the @entity193 conference and now there are claims she is at odds with his chief of staff , @entity11 one front - bencher says @entity50 is unhappy at the level of control @entity11 as the pm 's chief of staff			1
the foreign minister 's office denies the claims			2

the prime minister believes *public* attacks on his chief advisor are motivated by sexism
mr @entity0 told the @entity24 : ' i think people need to take a good hard look at themselves '
his remarks come amid reports of tensions between his chief of staff @entity11 and foreign minister @entity50
