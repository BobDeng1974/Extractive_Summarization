for all the best from our brilliant @entity1 , click here there are times when watching @entity6 can sap your energy			1
that much is true , never more so than during the @entity10			0
and this mundane @entity12 qualifying campaign has the makings of a lethargy - inducing trudge			0
so thank goodness for @entity17 and his curling free - kick			1
eyes were glazing over in @entity21 after 73 minutes of frustration against an @entity24 team with 10 men and little ambition			1
@entity27 was not the only one feeling weary			1
@entity28 popped @entity17 with an effort which squirted from the grasp of goalkeeper @entity31 and spilled into the net to win the game and inch the captain a little closer to the @entity6 goal record			1

man of the match : @entity81			0
referee : @entity99 ( @entity100 ) 6.5 ratings by @entity102 his pursuit of sir @entity104 has taken on a life of its own , since there is not a lot else to excite on the road to @entity109			0
he now has 43 goals from his 99 appearances , six short of sir @entity104 and five behind @entity113 , who was teased by his son on @entity115 with ' @entity17 's gon na get ya old man '			1
@entity36 had been preparing to take @entity17 off and replace him with @entity86 when the goal went in			1
the forms had been filled in and handed to the fourth official , according to @entity122 , who were pitch - side			0
@entity36 later denied this , which was odd , and talked his way into a muddle , as he is prone to do , claiming his backroom staff might have been doing that , but he wanted to keep his captain on			0
anyhow , when @entity86 eventually entered the fray , it was in place of @entity85 , who ' rolled an ankle ' according to the manager			0
it is not thought to be serious but @entity138 , with injuries piling up at @entity140 , will be anxious to check			0
@entity17 had misfired against @entity141 on thursday â€“ squandering a hatful of chances and scoring from a penalty - and was the chief culprit as more chances came and went in @entity21			1
it seemed set to be a tale of dreadful finishing by the @entity149 , despite playing against 10 men for nearly half the game			2
@entity24 lost their captain @entity52 - also winning his 99th cap - sent off for a second yellow card when he body - checked @entity82 , early in the second half			1
@entity17 , however , refused to be deterred			2
he has now scored 11 in 26 games since @entity36 took over from @entity157 and this one gave @entity6 maximum points from three games in @entity161 they are on the way to the manager 's artificial target to win all 10 qualifiers and were able to celebrate another clean sheet			2
@entity167 was the last player to score against them			0
@entity6 will have seen out his ban without conceding a goal , although they were almost caught out in the opening seconds with a shot by @entity173 's @entity60 , which clipped @entity78 on the heels and fizzed narrowly wide			1
the move started with a clear foul on @entity82 in midfield missed by the @entity179 referee @entity99 , who was very lenient with some feisty tackling by the home team , early on			1
@entity182 of @entity24 crunches @entity6 midfielder @entity82 in the very early stages and puts the home side on the attack @entity17 pressures @entity24 defender @entity53 as @entity6 look to make a fast start in @entity21 @entity17 volleys @entity6 's best chance of the opening exchanges over the bar from @entity81 's inswinging cross @entity81 in the thick of it as he is tackled by @entity193 ( right ) and @entity60 ( left ) @entity81 tries to drive @entity6 forward as @entity58 ( right ) is left floundering in the midfielder 's wake @entity85 tries to get round the all - action @entity58 , who goes to ground in an attempt to win the ball @entity81 's right - foot shot evades @entity24 captain @entity52 but goes just wide of the post in a frustrating first half @entity17 is pursued by @entity203 of @entity24 during a disappointing first half for the @entity6 captain @entity85 shoots for @entity6 but the visitors could not find a breakthrough in the opening 45 minutes @entity81 posted a picture on @entity210 of him with fellow @entity140 player @entity211 after their victory @entity81 took an arm in the face , lost his boot in another late tackle and @entity80 was wiped out by @entity182 , who somehow escaped a yellow card			1
@entity78 clattered through @entity60 after winning the ball , as if to warn the @entity219 they could have that sort of game if that 's what they wanted			0
when the yellow card finally came out it was to book @entity52 for holding back @entity85 and it proved costly when he was dismissed three minutes after the interval			0
@entity6 's best effort in the first - half came from @entity17 , who made an angled run , was found by @entity81 and took on the volley , dropping over his right shoulder			1
it was difficult but @entity17 caught it sweetly , possibly too sweetly , and it flashed over			2
on other occasions , he appeared less confident and uncertain in front of goal , making the runs and getting the chances but failing to test the goalkeeper			1
he missed one cross from @entity42 at the near - post and headed another wide			0
@entity17 looks to turn inside @entity24 captain @entity52 but the move was eventually snuffed out @entity85 stretches for the ball but just ca n't connect in front of goal as another chance goes begging @entity42 ( centre ) reacts with disbelief after being cautioned , seemingly for winning a header @entity52 ( partially obscured , centre ) reacts with disbelief after being sent off for hauling down @entity82 @entity17 ( left ) curls in a free - kick but the ball goes harmlessly high and wide - yet another wasted opportunity @entity24 's @entity50 challenges @entity85 as the @entity6 striker tries to make something happen in the area @entity27 ( second right ) was too tired to start so was on the bench for the first 64 minutes @entity27 makes his way on to the pitch at the @entity263 as he replaces @entity264 club mate @entity80 he darted clear again before the break , but was unable to fashion an effort on goal as the blue shirts recovered to crowd him out			1
it was beginning to feel like an extension of his frustrating night against @entity141 , when he had many chances but scored only once , from the penalty spot			0
@entity81 , excellent in the holding role without having to do much holding against a team who rarely had the ball , smashed one into the side - netting and @entity80 forced the first save of the game from @entity31 with a dipping shot from 30 yards , just before half - time			0
@entity36 deserves a little credit for taking the necessary risk to clinch the win , sending on @entity27 and @entity83 to inject pace and impetus			2
@entity27 had not started having complained of being tired on the eve of the game			1
@entity84 was selected instead and was bright and busy early on , but his clubmate came on won the free - kick on the edge of the penalty box which @entity17 finally converted			2
at last there was reward for a game @entity6 dominated almost as completely as the one against @entity141			2
@entity17 ought to have made it two			2
he was clean through again before the end but could not beat @entity31			0
he is going after the record in ones			0
but last night one was enough to wake @entity6 up			2
@entity6 substitute @entity83 is bundled over by @entity24 's @entity57 @entity17 ( left ) watches as the ball curls over the wall and in for @entity6 's only goal @entity17 's goal came from a free - kick right on the edge of the area ... for more from our brilliant @entity1 , click here @entity17 could have doubled @entity6 's lead but his attempted chip was easily gathered by @entity31 the forward stretches to try to reach a cross but only succeeding in booting the ball back to where it came from @entity17 connects with a header but it goes off target and another chance is missed @entity27 surges past @entity57 after his introduction as a 64th - minute substitute - no signs of tiredness here @entity27 ( right ) walks with @entity83 after being dropped to the bench by @entity6 because of apparent tiredness @entity36 looks contemplative in the middle of the pitch in @entity21 as @entity6 fans put up their flags behind him			1

@entity17 curls winning goal past @entity24 goalkeeper after 73 minutes
@entity17 missed plenty of chances in first half as @entity6 struggled
@entity27 came on after 64 minutes after starting on bench because he was ' tired '
@entity344 sent off for @entity24 in second half for foul on @entity82
