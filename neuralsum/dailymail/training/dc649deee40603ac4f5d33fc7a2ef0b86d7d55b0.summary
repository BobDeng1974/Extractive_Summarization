by @entity0 as a @entity3 anchor , i spend from 6am to 7pm on my feet			1
at 5ft 5in tall , high heels are essential if i ’m to have any screen presence , and while i adore my sexy 6in - heel @entity8 courts , i ’d love a pair which make my working day less of a torture			1
i ’ve always found cushioned soles and round - toed shoes far too fuddy - duddy			1
but now , designers claim they can make sexy shoes comfortable			1
i put my best ( size six ) foot forward to find out			2
it took me three minutes to tackle the fiddly laces and the shoes were heavy , but easy to wear — even if i did look like @entity30 in @entity31 ’re not very feminine , and look terrible with a dress			1
if i had to wear them , i ’d put them with trousers — or a toga			2
@entity37 : 8/10 style : 5/10 python print leather with cross strap ( £ 55 , gb.geox.com ) the sandal looks dainty and feminine , the heel is thick and stable , reducing the risk of post-prandial wobbles			2
cushioning on the inner sole is thick and squishy while the cross strap dips away from the ankle — making your leg look elongated and elegant			2
a great bonus for the vertically challenged ! the shoes are breathable — so no sweaty feet or blisters			1
@entity37 : 8/10 style : 9/10 @entity53 lattice heels ( £ 220 , sargossa.com ) these lattice shoes are certainly showstoppers , and you ’d never guess they boast a hidden padded insole			1
but when i wore these to a barbecue , i turned heads for all the wrong reasons			0
it was n’t just that i looked like a @entity64 wannabe , it was that they made a really loud clomping noise			0
the insole was comfortable , the leather lattice cut into my feet and when i tried to take them off , i discovered the zip had stuck			0
more like a form of torture than a fashion item			0
@entity37 : 1/10 style : 2/10 padded peep toe wedge ( £ 45 , hotter.com ) soft leather uppers and padding make these the most comfortable heels i ’ve ever worn			1
i felt like i was walking on air			0
they went on at breakfast time and , 12 hours later , it was as though i ’d been on my feet for just ten minutes			0
but — and it ’s a big but — the nasty beige colour and old - fashioned twist at the toe are hideously grannyish and unflattering			1
sorry , but even @entity89 would run a mile from these			0
@entity37 : 10/10 style : 0/10 white ankle strap shoes ( £ 192 , chiemihara.com ) the thick , column - style heel made these look as if like they ’d come straight from the set of @entity95			1
but they were really comfy , though i did n’t love the strap across the ankle , which shortens the leg			2
a few of us at @entity3 have a book club and we go dancing once a month			0
next time , i ’m out with them tripping the light fantastic , i ’ll be in these			0
@entity37 : 10/10 style : 3/10			0

at 5ft 5in @entity0 wears heels every day but they leave her in agony
the *newsreader* finds padded soles and round - toed shoes ' fuddy duddy '
will she still look hot to trot in any of these seven comfy *alternatives* ?
