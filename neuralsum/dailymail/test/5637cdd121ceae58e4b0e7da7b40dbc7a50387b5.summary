this is the shocking moment a young @entity2 girl fires a machine gun at @entity4 , before boasting she has killed 400 of the @entity6 militants - as she is egged on with cries of ' kill , kill '			1
the little girl , who appears to be around six or seven , is shown sitting on a ridge in her bright pink jumper and trainers , just behind the large machine gun			1
she chats away to a man behind the camera , telling him she is ' shooting at @entity15 ' in @entity2 - before firing several rounds into the desert			1
shocking : the little girl claims she is firing the machine gun at ' @entity19 ' , the arabic name for @entity4 kill : she tells the man she has killed 400 of the extremists so far , as he encourages her to kill more @entity23 : however , it is unclear exactly what the girl is shooting at in the minute - long video the man asks her how many @entity4 fighters she has killed so far , and she holds up four fingers while boasting ' 400 '			1
as she fires the gun , and , according to @entity32 , he says : ' kill , kill			0
' however , whether she has actually hit anything is unclear			0
the video - entitled @entity35 shoots @entity37 - was posted in january , but has only recently emerged on social networks			2
@entity39 is the acronym for the @entity42 's @entity41 , which has been battling @entity4 since the extremists rise to power last year			0
but while @entity4 are known for using young recruits to carry out executions , fight and even become suicide bombers , the @entity2 have so far kept their children out of the battle			2
propaganda : isis are known to use children in videos like this one , where they are being trained as fighters sickening : in more horrific videos , @entity4 have claimed to be using children as executioners feared : the @entity2 are famous for their female fighters , who have been key to driving @entity4 out rumours : @entity4 fighters believe if they are killed by a woman they wo n't get their virgins in the afterlife one of the most horrifying videos released by the @entity6 showed a young boy seeming to execute a so - called spy			1
they have also released a video of dozens of ' child soldiers ' from @entity69 , apparently being trained to fight against @entity4 enemies			0
instead , they are famous for their female recruits : it has proved to be one of their strengths against the militants , as they appear to believe if they are killed by a woman they will not be rewarded with 72 virgins in the afterlife			0
as a result @entity4 fighters have been reluctant to enter battles with the @entity85 , or @entity86 , reportedly leading to descent within the ranks of the terrorists and hastening their retreat from battles in places like @entity92 .			0

video of little girl firing several rounds ' towards @entity4 ' has gone viral
the girl , dressed in pink , tells man off camera she has killed 400 fighters
the man encourages her by saying ' kill , kill ' as she shoots machine gun
@entity2 known for their female fighters - but @entity4 known for using children
