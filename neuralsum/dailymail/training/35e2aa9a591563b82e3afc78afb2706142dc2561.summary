@entity0 has called on the @entity1 to be more consistent in its treatment of managers , claiming some of his colleagues escape sanction for offences that would land him in trouble			1
the @entity11 manager was on thursday charged for his stinging criticism of referee @entity13 last saturday , with the @entity1 accusing him of implying ‘ the match referee was motivated by bias ’			1
@entity0 has insisted that his intention was to question @entity13 ’s experience and not his integrity , when he said at the weekend that the 35 - year - old official had been ‘ influenced ’ by @entity21 ’s players during @entity11 ’s 2 - 1 defeat			1
@entity0 addresses the media in his pre-match press conference last week @entity0 and @entity25 greet each other prior to the game at @entity28 last saturday but the @entity1 have taken a dimmer view and given the veteran manager until 6pm on monday to answer the charge			1
the charge came almost immediately after @entity0 finished his weekly press briefing , in which he suggested the rules regarding post-match comments are not evenly applied			1
he said : ‘ the only thing i think managers would ask for is consistency , really			0
there ’s been incidents over the last couple of weeks that if it was @entity0 , i might have been charged			1
so you do look from afar and wonder how they arrive at certain aspects of the charges			0
‘ they have one of two people full - time just looking at comments so they ’ve got to earn their wages			2
i think somebody has to look at what ’s said because i think certain comments are out of order			0
‘ but i have seen managers say things that i thought were way out of order over the last few years and they have n’t had a charge			2
so it ’s difficult to understand how they come about the charges			0
i do n’t think we know really how they do it to this day			0
’ @entity0 added : ‘ i do n’t think they go after me , i think they look at everything individually			2
i just think that when i look at the comments people make and do n’t get charges , it surprises me and i think if i ’d made similar comments , i probably would have got a charge			0
