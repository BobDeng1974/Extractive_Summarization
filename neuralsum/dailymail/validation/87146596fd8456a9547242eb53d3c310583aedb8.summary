@entity1 ’s elections chief @entity0 , above , confirmed the party ‘ may use some investment borrowing ’ to fund its manifesto if it wins @entity5 yesterday admitted it will borrow billions more than the @entity6 – as experts warned the party ’s plans would leave a £ 30billion black hole at the heart of the nation ’s finances			1
@entity1 ’s elections chief @entity0 confirmed the party ‘ may use some investment borrowing ’ to fund its manifesto if it wins the election			1
and the @entity17 said @entity5 ’s plans would potentially leave @entity19 with a permanent budget deficit – piling up massive debts for future generations			1
the think tank ’s director @entity23 said @entity5 ’s proposals allowed it to maintain an overall deficit as high as £ 30billion by 2020 – at a time when the @entity6 aim to be running a surplus of £ 7billion to pay off @entity19 ’s debts			1
he told the @entity30 : ‘ it is clear @entity5 want to do quite a lot less in terms of the total ( deficit )			2
they do n’t want to get rid of the deficit altogether , they are happy to borrow to invest			0
they would be happy with a deficit of £ 25 - 30billion , whereas the @entity40 do n’t want a deficit at all			2
’ miss @entity0 later said she did not recognise the £ 30billion			1
but under pressure , she confirmed @entity5 would borrow to fund the government ’s investment spending , which is forecast to be about that amount by 2020			1
‘ we are going to balance the books for current expenditure by the end of the @entity50 , ’ she said			2
‘ we may use some investment borrowing for much - needed investment but not for day - to - day spending			1
' those figures are other people ’s figures			0
it depends on what the books are like			0
’ @entity40 treasury minister @entity59 said miss @entity0 had ‘ let the cat out of the bag ’			1
she added : ‘ @entity5 have finally had it dragged out of them that they ’d borrow more if @entity1 gets into @entity64			2
add in the fact that they ’re refusing to admit which taxes they ’d raise and you ’ve got a recipe for total economic chaos			0
’ miss @entity0 also clashed with @entity30 presenter @entity72 as he questioned @entity5 ’s claims of an ‘ explosion ’ in the use of zero hours contracts			1
she snapped at him : ‘ in the real world , @entity72 where i live , ok , unlike where you live … ’ mr @entity72 hit back : ‘ you ’ve no idea where i live , just answer the question			2
’ mr @entity1 will use the launch of his party ’s business manifesto today to warn that @entity40 plans for a referendum on @entity87 could create instability for firms shadow chancellor @entity90 told last september ’s @entity5 conference that ‘ in our manifesto there will be no proposals for any new spending paid for by additional borrowing ’			1
but the fine print of @entity5 ’s pledges show it has left itself flexibility to borrow the government ’s entire capital budget for spending on things such as roads , schools and @entity107 foreign secretary @entity106 yesterday warned @entity5 may set out no more details of its tax and spending plans before the election			2
critics point out its deficit reduction programme amounts to less than £ 1billion of cuts and the reintroduction of the 50p top tax rate , which experts warn may raise nothing			0
challenged over @entity5 ’s plans , mr @entity106 said : ‘ we have set out our programme			2
’ miss @entity0 said @entity5 was ‘ very clear we can widen the tax base ’ – suggesting the party plans to drag more people into paying tax			1
@entity5 later insisted this meant getting more people into better paid jobs so they would pay more tax and receive fewer benefits			0
shadow chancellor @entity90 told last september ’s @entity5 conference that ‘ in our manifesto there will be no proposals for any new spending paid for by additional borrowing ’ mr @entity1 will use the launch of his party ’s business manifesto today to warn that @entity40 plans for a referendum on @entity87 could create instability for firms			1
he is also expected to make a fresh attack on planned @entity40 cuts			0
but former @entity5 health secretary @entity143 said he had to reach beyond @entity5 ’s usual supporters to have any hope of winning			0
mr @entity143 told @entity147 radio : ‘ instead of going down to your core vote you have got to be reaching out to your non-core vote			0
why ? for a very pragmatic reason – if you are going to form a majority government you can not really do it with 32.8 per cent of the vote			0
’ meanwhile , the @entity6 also came under fire over their plans for £ 12 billion in welfare cuts after @entity157 indicated the proposals may not be made public before the election			0
the @entity160 added : ‘ when we are right and we are ready , we will talk about what we plan to do ... ‘ ( voters ) know for certain that we are going to save that £ 12 billion			0
we may , we may not , decide that it ’s relevant to put something out there about some of those changes			0
’ labour activists were in mutiny last night over this ‘ shameful ’ £ 5 mug boasting that the party would put controls on immigration			1
the red cup , for sale on the fundraising section of @entity5 ’s website , is one of five carrying its key election pledges			0
activists dubbed it the ‘ @entity184 mug ’ , referring to the @entity186 leader , and called on @entity5 to withdraw it and drop all plans to control migration			1
but the controversy led to a surge in sales			0
by last night almost 250 of the mugs had been sold compared to just six of the ones promoting @entity5 ’s vow to create a ‘ strong economic foundation ’			1
veteran left - winger @entity196 said : ‘ this shameful mug is an embarrassment			0
but the real problem is that immigration controls are one of our pledges at all			0
’ it comes after @entity5 was branded patronising for using a pink bus to attract women voters			2
a party spokesman defended the mugs , saying : ‘ @entity5 has five election pledges			1

@entity0 confirmed party ‘ may use investment borrowing ’ if it wins
@entity17 has *highlighted* concerns with @entity5 manifesto
but miss @entity0 says she does not recognise their £ 30billion figure
