by @entity0 taxis and buses will automatically switch to electric mode when they enter some of @entity5 ’s most polluted streets as part of a new scheme to eradicate emissions			1
new technology will allow the vehicles to switch to ‘ zero emission ’ mode when they enter areas at risk of high air pollution such as @entity16 in @entity17			1
it comes as @entity17 mayor @entity19 revealed plans for all taxis in the capital to be hybrid in four years ’ time			1
@entity37 , the mayor ’s environment advisor , said the advanced technology would allow vehicles to recognise when they are in highly - polluted areas , prompting them to switch to the greener mode			1
he told @entity44 : ‘ with geo - fencing technology , when the vehicle crosses a particular line , it will go into electric mode			1
some of our buses in future will also be doing this			0
‘ the technology can be responsive , so if one bit of town is more polluted than another , then the buses and taxis would switch to electric mode where the pollution was worse			1
’ he said the technology could be fitted to private cars in ‘ due course ’			0
although the exact area where taxis and buses will ‘ switch ’ to electric mode has not yet been confirmed , it will no doubt include the most polluted roads in @entity17 as highlighted by a study earlier this year			1
in february , figures from the @entity72 claimed that traffic travelling along the @entity74 - known as @entity75 - which runs adjacent to @entity76 , produced the highest levels of the toxic gas at an average of 152 micrograms per cubic metre of air in 2012			2
@entity17 mayor @entity19 has revealed plans for all taxis in the capital to be hybrid in four years ’ time the study also found that @entity16 was highly polluted , registering at an average of 150 micrograms near @entity87 , while @entity88 has an average of 138 micrograms of nitrogen dioxide per cubic metre of air			1
@entity92 , @entity93 and @entity94 were also all found to have seriously high levels of the pollutant			0
the latest news comes after it was announced that drivers of diesel cars could face a congestion charge - style daily fee of about £ 11.50 to enter central @entity17 , in a bid to further tackle air pollution			1
the payment could come if diesels fail to meet tough @entity107 emission targets when an ultra-low emission zone ( @entity109 ) is introduced in central @entity17 from 2020			0
the zone would have the same boundaries as the @entity110 , and only diesel vehicles that meet the @entity114 emissions standard would be exempt from the charge			2
motoring organisations have had a mixed reaction to the plans , with some unhappy about the possible charge			0
findings released in february revealed the most polluted roads in central @entity17 , with @entity16 , @entity92 and @entity76 being among the polluted hotspots in the capital @entity125 director professor @entity124 said : ‘ this is n't quite a miss - selling scandal , but for years ministers took their eye off the ball and encouraged drivers to buy diesels to help fight climate change			2
‘ that has come at a cost : local air pollution			1
today 10 million cars in @entity5 are powered by diesel engines - a third of the total			0
‘ part of the problem is regulation			0
in laboratory conditions diesel cars have met strict test criteria			0
unfortunately that performance has n't been matched on the road and now we have a significant health issue because of the dash for diesel			0
’ @entity154 president @entity153 added : ‘ it is somewhat ironic that cars are banned from the most polluted street in @entity17 - @entity16			2
the vehicles that have most effect on air quality in @entity17 are buses , taxis and trucks			2
‘ the first move should be to target the gross polluters and get them off our roads in order to have a greater and more immediate impact on air quality			0

' geo - fencing ' technology will let vehicles switch to electric in certain zones
vehicles will become ' zero emission ' as they travel on most polluted streets
all new taxis must be hybrid by 2018 under new plans by @entity19
part of a wider scheme to tackle air pollution and *vastly* reduce emissions
