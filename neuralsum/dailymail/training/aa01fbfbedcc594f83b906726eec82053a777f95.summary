@entity2 scientists found the taller a post-menopausal woman is , the greater her risk of developing cancer			1
@entity12 research found that for every 10cm increase in height , there was a 13 per cent increase in risk of developing any cancer			1
the study , which revealed more cancers are associated with height than those linked to weight , has surprised scientists			1
height was linked to cancers of the breast , colon , endometrium , kidney , ovary , rectum , and thyroid , as well as to multiple myeloma and melanoma			0
these associations did not change even after adjusting for factors known to influence these cancers , in the study of 20,928 post-menopausal women			0
dr @entity41 , senior epidemiologist of @entity12 , said : ' we were surprised at the number of cancer sites that were positively associated with height			2
' in this data set , more cancers are associated with height than were associated with body mass index			0
' ultimately , cancer is a result of processes having to do with growth , so it makes sense that hormones or other growth factors that influence height may also influence cancer risk			2
' dr @entity41 said some genetic variations associated with height are also linked to cancer risk , but more studies are needed to better understand how these height - related genetic variations predispose some men and women to cancer			2
the scientists used data from a study that recruited post-menopausal women who were aged 50 to 79 between 1993 and 1998			0
at the start of the study , the women answered questions about physical activity and their height and weight were measured			0
modern family actress @entity78 ( pictured ) who is 1 metre 70 cms tall , beat thyroid cancer the researchers identified 20,928 women who had been diagnosed with one or more invasive cancers during the follow - up period of 12 years			0
to study the effect of height , they accounted for many factors influencing cancers , including age , weight , education , smoking habits , alcohol consumption , and hormone therapy			2
they found that for every 10 centimetre increase in height , there was a 13 per cent increase in risk of developing any cancer			1
among specific cancers , there was a 13 to 17 per cent increase in the risk of getting melanoma and cancers of the breast , ovary , endometrium , and colon			1
@entity12 research found that for every 10cm increase in height , there was a 13 per cent increase in risk of developing any cancer			1
the study , which revealed more cancers are associated with height than those linked to weight , has surprised scientists there was a 23 to 29 per cent increase in the risk of developing cancers of the kidney , rectum , thyroid , and blood			1
of the 19 cancers studied , none showed a negative association with height			1
the scientists also examined the participants ' mammography , @entity137 , and colorectal cancer screening histories , which could have swayed conclusions of the study , but found that the results remained unchanged			0
dr @entity41 said : ' the association of height with a number of cancer sites suggests that exposures in early life , including nutrition , play a role in influencing a person 's risk of cancer			0
' there is currently a great deal of interest in early - life events that influence health in adulthood and our study fits with this area			0
' the findings were published in the journal @entity165 .			0

@entity2 scientists found that for every 10cm increase in height in a taller post-menopausal woman , there is a 13 per cent increase cancer risk
the study from @entity12 , which revealed more cancers are associated with height than those linked to weight , has surprised scientists
of the 19 cancers studied , none showed a negative association with height
