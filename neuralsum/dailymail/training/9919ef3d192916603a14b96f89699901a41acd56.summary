by @entity0 published : 09:39 est , 29 march 2012 updated : 12:13 est , 29 march 2012 @entity1 and @entity2 are just two of the 1.2 million @entity4 people who suffer from @entity5 which leaves those afflicted neurotically obsessed about things such as tidiness or cleanliness			1
a mental health organisation is now expanding research to see if a strain of bacteria may cause children to develop a particular condition with @entity5 - type symptoms			1
the study by the @entity19 ( @entity20 ) , based in @entity21 , @entity22 , will see if there is a link between @entity26 bacteria and a condition called @entity28 ( pans )			1
cause : research is to begin to find out if the @entity26 strain of bacteria could be the cause of an @entity5 type condition in children @entity28 causes children and teens to suddenly develop symptoms or abnormal eating behaviors , along with other psychiatric symptoms without any known cause			1
@entity42 , managing director of the @entity20 , said : “ parents will describe children with pans as overcome by a ‘ ferocious ’ onset of obsessive thoughts , compulsive rituals and overwhelming fears			2
' scientists think that after it detects a @entity26 infection , the body 's immune system responds by creating antibodies which sometimes mistakenly attack the heart , joints , and brain			1
in children , this attack on the brain can cause the bundle of nerves called the basal ganglia to become inflamed			2
this , in turn , can lead children to develop , seemingly overnight , severe symptoms of ocd and anorexia			2
according to the @entity20 children with the condition can appear terror - stricken , suffer extreme separation anxiety , shifting from laughter to tears for no apparent reason and regress to temper tantrums , " baby talk , " or bedwetting			2
other symptoms include undergoing sudden deterioration in school performance or learning abilities and exhibiting sensory and motor abnormalities			0
@entity5 sufferer : @entity1 is one of 1.2 million @entity4 people who suffer from @entity5 the @entity20 hopes the study will improve diagnosis and treatment			1
it also wants to find out if there is an alternative cause of pans apart from @entity26 bacteria			1
between one and two per cent of the @entity4 population are thought to suffer from @entity5 although most people only have minor symptoms			1
one of the most common examples is an irrational fear of germs and dirt			0
other obsessions include worries about security issues such as having left the cooker on or the house unlocked , a need for everything in life to be ordered with extreme precision , and a fear of making a mistake			0
such obsessions make the sufferer feel anxious			0
in an effort to ease that anxiety they take actions such as washing their hands every few minutes or going around the house checking everything is locked			0
many sufferers know they are being irrational but feel powerless to stop			0
the @entity19 has now launched a project to find such cases and improve diagnosis and treatment , including a study to see how well @entity125 , a human antibody treatment used to dampen autoimmune reactions , reverses the syndrome			2
it also wants to find out how many such cases are related to strep infections , or if there are other causes			0
the @entity19 has now put out guidelines for diagnosing @entity135 's chorea whenever it appears , whether or not the child is known to have had a recent strep infection			0
tracking all cases this way should allow researchers to investigate causes more thoroughly , as well as diagnostic signs , and treatments .			0

study will look for link between @entity26 bacteria and @entity5
