@entity0 fell cheaply for the second time in the match for @entity2 against county champions @entity4 @entity0 , who made just three in the first innings , mustered five at his second attempt on tuesday morning but he will do so on the back of two failures in his only two first - class innings since last season			1
@entity0 caused a stir last week when he described @entity15 's decision to replace him as their @entity28 captain as ' probably wrong ' , in hindsight			2
the opener continued his poor form in a one - day international series in @entity33 late last year , and @entity15 responded by dropping him in favour of @entity35			0
they went on , however , to make an embarrassing early exit from the global tournament in @entity39 and @entity40 - beating only minnows @entity41 and @entity42 , and eliminated by a defeat against @entity44			0
the @entity15 captain has struggled for form with the bat and heads to the @entity18 in terrible nick @entity10 ( third from left ) celebrates after dismissing @entity0 early on for @entity4 @entity0 agreed to play for @entity2 against @entity4 at the @entity50 , in the traditional curtain - raiser for the new season			1
but there has been no return to form for @entity15 's most prolific @entity15 centurion - who is without an international hundred in any format since may 2013			0
@entity2 were in a spot of bother too after his early dismissal , on 30 for one and still needing another 121 runs merely to avoid an innings defeat .			0

@entity0 out made just five for the @entity2 against @entity4
the @entity15 captain was dismissed for three in the first innings
