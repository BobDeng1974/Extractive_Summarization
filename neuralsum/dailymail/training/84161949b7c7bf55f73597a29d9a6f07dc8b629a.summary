@entity1 , 24 , suffers from the life - threatening lung condition which means that she needs daily physiotherapy to prevent mucus build up			1
she was facing the prospect of a life - saving lung transplant but incredibly , her love of belting out hits from her favourite musical , @entity16 , has increased her lung capacity by almost 20 per cent			1
as a child , ms @entity1 ’ parents were warned she may only live to nine years old - but the charity worker refused to let her condition get in the way as she dreamed a dream of musical stardom			1
now the aspiring pop star , from @entity27 , @entity28 , has sung for prince @entity29 and already has a single in the top five of the @entity32 chart			2
she said : ‘ when people discover that i have cystic fibrosis , they ca n't believe that i 'm able to belt out the tunes from @entity16			1
‘ most sufferers tend to have quite a bad cough and get very breathless , so for some it 's surprising that i can sing at all			2
‘ singing actually exercises my lungs , and because i 'm singing all the time , my lungs get twice as much exercise , so it really improves my health			1
’ she added : ‘ i went for a check - up recently and the doctors told me that my lung function was up to 88 per cent - i could n't believe it			1
‘ i 'm lucky that something i love not only makes me happy , but actually improves my health too			0
’ cystic fibrosis is caused by a faulty gene that controls the movement of salt and water in and out of the cells within the body , it affects 9,000 people in the @entity59 and is thought to cause two deaths every week			1
it affects the internal organs , especially the lungs , by clogging them with thick sticky mucus , making it hard to breathe			1
experts agree that singing can help those with the condition			1
@entity71 , ceo of the @entity72 , explained : ‘ many people with cystic fibrosis find unique ways to help keep their lungs clear and themselves well , and singing can form part of the breathing exercises that can help to shift the mucus , decreasing chance of infection			1
‘ @entity1 serves as an inspiration to thousands of others with cystic fibrosis that they can follow their dreams and achieve success at doing the things they love			1
’ she has also dueted with @entity88 , and even got the chance to perform for prince @entity29 at a charity ball ms @entity1 began having tests for the condition when she was just five months old , but was given the official diagnosis after her second birthday			0
she said : ‘ i do n't ever remember being told that i have @entity95 , i just always knew i had it			0
‘ i was probably about seven years old when i realised how serious the condition is			0
‘ none of my school friends were going to the hospital all the time or taking loads of tablets every day			0
i suddenly realised i was different			0
‘ as i 've got older i 'm used to living with @entity95 i have to do physio on my chest every morning to clear the mucus on my lungs , and i take about 30 different drugs throughout the day			2
having improved her lung capacity , she now wants to be a professional singer ‘ every morning i take my inhaler , and a nebuliser which takes about an hour , and i have to eat a high calorie diet as the @entity95 stops me from absorbing the goodness in my food			1
’ ms @entity1 ’ love of singing started when she was five			2
her mother heard her singing along to a tape and was surprised how good she was so enrolled her in an amateur dramatics group			2
since then she has been determined to make a name for herself , and regularly plays gigs up and down the country			0
she has also dueted with @entity88 , and even got the chance to perform for prince @entity29 at a charity ball in 2008			0
ms @entity1 said : ‘ singing for prince @entity29 was incredible			2
after i sang he gestured for me to come over and we spent half an hour chatting			0
‘ i was going to audition for x factor at the time , and he told me that 'd he vote for me if i went on			0
’ she said ‘ i 'd practice until i could sing a whole song without coughing			0
the more i sang , the bigger breaths i could take , and i struggled much less in everyday life			0
‘ it started to become clear that it was having a really positive affect on my health , and my doctors agreed			0
’ the next goal in @entity1 's singing career is to secure a record deal			2
