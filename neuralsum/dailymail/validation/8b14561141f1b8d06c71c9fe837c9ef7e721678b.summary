@entity0 insists the time is not right for a fight against @entity3 - because nobody in @entity5 knows who the @entity7 welterweight is			1
@entity3 called out his @entity10 rival after stopping @entity11 in four rounds in the first defence of his @entity15 world title			1
but @entity0 has his eyes on bigger fish , despite promoter @entity18 booking @entity19 for june 13 should the @entity21 man has a change of heart			2
@entity0 ( left ) has rejected the chance to fight @entity3 in june at @entity19 because of @entity24 @entity3 defended his @entity26 title against @entity11 after knocking him down four times he told fighthype : ' no one in @entity5 knows who @entity3 is , whereas i ca n't walk the street without it getting crazy , everyone knows who @entity0 is but it 's a nice thing			1
' june i ca n't do because of @entity24 , maybe that 's why he 's calling me out because he knows that i ca n't do june			2
maybe the end of the year it could be done , i fight twice a year but that 's because @entity24 falls right in the middle			2
' i 've seen his performance against @entity11 and he 's going on like beating @entity11 is like beating a five - time @entity43			0
the @entity21 - boxer did n't deny the fight could happen in the future but wants @entity3 to fight better opponents the @entity7 fighter has been gunning for @entity0 for a number of years and feels he deserves a shot ' he was fighting a b , c - class opponent , no disrespect to @entity11 but @entity3 is now a world champion and he needs to fight world class opponents , the likes of the [ @entity58 ] @entity57 and you have big names in the welterweight decision but he 's picking and choosing who he wants to fight			1
' @entity0 has made it clear he wants a big fight in @entity5 to really boost his profile and is targeting two of the biggest names in the sport to give him what he wants but refused to deny that the @entity70 wo n't happen sometime in the future			1
' whoever they put in front of him , he beats , so you ca n't really disrespect that but the fight between me and him wo n't happen until the end of the year or maybe next year			0
it 's a fight i know that is going to happen but not just yet because i 'm taking a different route			0
@entity0 is more focused on fighting the big names like @entity84 ( right ) and @entity85 ' my route is to fight the big names like the @entity85 's and the [ @entity84 ] @entity84 's and be amongst those names and also to fight in @entity5 and bring my name up over here			1
' i just have to keep on doing what i do and keep putting on great performances for my fans			0
whatever fights the fans want to see , i 'll give it to them			0
' the @entity95 and the brook fights will happen so i 'll never say no to any opponent - like the [ @entity100 ] @entity99 fight and i was one of the first guys to beat him and the first guy to put him down .			0

@entity0 **admits** his route is to fight world class fighters in the future
