talking on a mobile phone is a known driving distraction that can increase the chance of having an accident			1
but scientists claim that talking to a passenger , who can see what the driver sees , may actual boost driving safety			1
research has shown that ‘ conversation partners ’ , who can see a driver ’s view , moderated their conversation according to what was happening on the road , making the driver more aware of the road			1

research has shown that ‘ conversation partners ’ who could see a driver ’s view moderated their conversation according to what was happening on the road , making the driver more aware of the road ‘ we ’ve done years of study on driver distraction and previous studies suggest that passengers often are n’t distracting , ’ said @entity33 , @entity35 psychology professor and @entity37 director			1
‘ in fact , passengers can be helpful , especially if they ’re adults who have had experience and also are active drivers themselves			0
’ for the study , the scientists set up four driving scenarios in a driving simulator : a driver alone , a driver speaking to a passenger , a driver speaking to someone on a hands - free mobile , and a driver speaking to someone who could see the driver and observe the driving scene via hands - free videophone			1
the drivers encountered various driving challenges that included merging and navigating around unpredictable drivers in other cars , in the simulation			0
the researchers tracked the drivers ’ lateral moves , distance from other cars , speed , collisions , and ability to find and take a designated exit			0
they also recorded speech and tracked the driver ’s eye movements			1
researchers were not surprised to find that driving alone was the safest option			1
there were significantly fewer collisions when drivers were alone in the simulated car than when they were speaking to a passenger in the car , but passengers helped drivers find their exits and improved their memory of road signs they were not surprised to find that driving alone was the safest option , which previous studies have already shown			1
there were significantly fewer collisions when drivers were alone in the simulated car than when they were speaking to a passenger in the car , according to the study , published in the journal @entity98			0
passengers helped drivers find their exits and improved their memory of road signs , but they detracted from overall safety , including the avoidance of collisions , professor @entity33 said			0
this means that passengers make people a safer driver compared to when they 're using a mobile , but it is not the safest option			1
the study found that speaking to someone on a mobile was the most dangerous of the scenarios , more than tripling the likelihood of a collision			2
the most interesting results , however , occurred when a driver spoke to someone who was n’t in the car but who could see what was happening via videophone			2
graduate student @entity122 explained : ‘ drivers were less likely to be involved in a collision when their remote partner could see what they were seeing , ’ @entity122 said			2
‘ and this benefit seems to be driven by changes in the way partners talked to the driver			2
’ the study found that speaking to someone on a mobile ( stock image ) was the most dangerous of the scenarios , more than tripling the likelihood of a collision seeing the driver and watching what was going on in traffic during the conversation allowed the non-driving partner to stop speaking , for example , when something unexpected occurred on the road , or to point out a situation that might be dangerous			1
‘ conversations with a partner on the videophone were very similar to conversations with a passenger , ’ he said			2
the findings demonstrate that a passenger or conversation partner can contribute significantly to the safety of the driving experience , professor @entity33 said			0
‘ there is no condition in which having the videophone information is worse than speaking on a cell phone ; the collisions are reduced 40 or 50 per cent - that ’s pretty big , ’ he said			1
‘ i ’m not suggesting people speak on cell phones while driving , but if the driver is speaking to someone who is not in the car , it would be helpful for the conversation partner to have information about what the driver is seeing and doing			1
’ a company has developed a ' texting gun ' that can recognise the frequency of a text message , allowing police to fine people one company claims to have developed a ‘ texting gun ’ that can recognise the frequency of a text message , allowing police to fine people for doing it			0
everyone knows that texting while driving is @entity183 the @entity184 it is illegal to use your phone at all when driving , while the law varies in the @entity189 from state to state - most allow phone calls but no texting			2
drivers caught using a phone in the @entity184 can be charged up to £ 1,000 ( $ 1,640 ) and also lose their license - although hands - free kits and sat navs are allowed			0
these inconsistencies can make it difficult for police to work out if a person is being distracted by their phone or not			0
this led to @entity204 - based @entity203 to design a gun that can detect frequencies			0
the device , called the @entity208 , is currently in production although no release date or price has been announced yet			0
according to the @entity213 , it can discern the different frequencies from a text message , phone call and data transfer			0
it apparently uses similar technology used by cable repairmen to find where a cable is damaged , who look for transmission ‘ leaks ’			0
the device can apparently even work out which person in the car is texting , so it will not alert police to issue a fine if it spots frequencies from a passenger .			0

study shows ‘ conversation partners ’ who can see a driver ’s view moderated their conversation according to what was happening on the road
this made the driver more aware of the road - and safer
driving alone is the safest option and talking on a mobile phone the worst
