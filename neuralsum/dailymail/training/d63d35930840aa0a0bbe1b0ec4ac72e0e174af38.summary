hearing the @entity2 fans laying into @entity3 , i have to laugh			1
not because it 's funny			2
it 's really hard when you 're a manager and you keep reading speculation about your future and hearing things being sung on the terraces			1
but it reminds me of what happened to me			0
when i was manager at @entity15 , we played away at @entity16 in a local derby with 25,000 fans on my back			1
the @entity15 fans stood there quietly as the volume seemed to go up a level each time the chant , ' you 're getting sacked in the morning ' went around the stadium			1
at first i stood there stony - faced			0
then i realised they were probably right ! i took a deep breath and started to nod in agreement , with a big smile on my face , knowing i was a lame dog on the way to the sacking graveyard			0
it can be tough on the touchline			2
whether you 're at the top or bottom , it 's a mad place to be			1
@entity56 likens the vitriol aimed at @entity3 to his brief experience in charge of @entity15 in 2007 @entity60 me fifty quid it was half - time in our away match at @entity65 and one of our players said : ' we need someone to attack these corners and free kicks			1
' i pointed to our big strong centre back @entity72 , who had not scored all season , and told the team if he scores i 'll join them at the corner flag to celebrate			2
my throwaway comment drifted around the room			0
@entity72 , who moved from @entity78 to @entity79 in the summer , scored a last - ditch winner for his side against @entity65 and lost @entity23 £ 50 we were one up , but after 88 minutes @entity65 equalised			1
then deep into stoppage time , we won a corner			0
as i sat in the technical area i was thinking this was a good point away from home			0
@entity72 strode forward , looking across and cutting me an evil stare			2
he got closer and closer to the 18 yard box and the spring in his step was that of a passionate gladiator going in to his final battle			0
the corner came over and big @entity72 leaped seven foot above the 6ft 7in centre back – i might be exaggerating slightly there – to power in an unstoppable @entity97 - like , @entity98 - like , @entity100 - like header into the back of the net			2
all the players ran to the corner flag and beckoned me over			0
the subs were pushing and prodding me to go			0
but the fourth official , god bless him , saved me a fine of a weeks ' wages by pointing his finger and telling me not to do it			0
the moment was there in front of me			0
i took a step back , a deep breath , and sat down			0
when the players came in a minute later , with three points in the bag , our young full back @entity117 looked up as i put a sugar in my coffee and said , ' @entity125 , you bottled it			0
' it 's cost me £ 50 for the players @entity129 fund , but it saved me a weeks ' wages			1
@entity132 tactics every time it comes around , i try to catch as much @entity132 action as i can			0
i shot off from training early on the friday , crashed on the sofa with a packet of digestive biscuits and barely missed a shot apart from a few hours on saturday afternoon winning that match against @entity65 to leave us top of the table			1
good old @entity143 reminded me of a @entity146 - style @entity145 ambassador who is popular with everybody			2
@entity148 was out of order for having a go at him just after they had lost			1
he spoke of @entity153 's management style as having ' pods ' of players and seeking opinions of who they would like to play with and if players were not in form or physically needed to be rested			2
the senior players in the pods would have open communication with @entity153			1
it was kind of like a pyramid effect			0
@entity148 ( left ) was out of order criticising the performance of @entity132 captain @entity143 ( right ) but the pyramid - like ' pod ' system is precisely what @entity23 uses in his own management style well , at @entity173 i worked on exactly the same management style			1
we had one team captain , four senior players helping me decide training with my two assistants @entity180 and @entity181 helping me make the final decisions			1
it is the same here now at @entity79 where i have two player coaches and five senior players who all contribute to our training , to the work we do , to the game plan , to the physical needs of the players and , most importantly , to keep all our players united and fighting for the cause			1
@entity195 's analysis the player i keep hearing about ... @entity197 it 's always nice and reassuring when you see players you 've highlighted and tried to sign in the past going on and doing very well			1
@entity202 , the @entity16 striker who is top scorer in the @entity204 , was on loan at @entity206 from @entity207 when we tried to get him on a season - long loan while i was in charge at @entity173			2
@entity197 , the @entity204 's top scorer so far , will be a success in the @entity212 he has pace and excellent technical finishing skills and a hunger and appetite			1
he always plays on the shoulder of the last defender looking to get in behind them			0
i 'm delighted he 's gone on and done well , and i 'm not surprised at his success so far this season			2
he 's still only 21 , and , for me , his progression into the @entity204 , after playing at @entity206 , is an all - important stepping stone to what will be a successful career in the @entity212			1
he will be banging @entity212 goals in soon – and maybe for @entity16			2
one thing i 'd change about ... foreign imports after watching @entity231 play in the @entity232 this summer and having traipsed around @entity233 and seen how disastrous those tournaments were , something needs to change			0
a rule needs to be brought in that only quality overseas players can play in our leagues			0
it 's been flooded with average players at all levels and it 's stopping good young @entity244 players getting the valuable experience they need			2
a system should be put in place , so only players who have 10 caps for a national team in the top 10 @entity252 rankings , or 20 caps for teams between 10 and 20 , or 30 caps for those between 20 and 30 , and so on , can join @entity244 clubs			1
we need to sort out our national team			0
@entity261 's sutocratic style could mean tricky times ahead for @entity263 the big issue ... @entity261 going public that the @entity263 players have been unable to grasp his ideas and trying to blend so many magnificent , talented , egotistical forwards is going to be a true test of his management style			1
his school teacher background , his straight , upright spine gives the impression of an autocratic leader who believes he is above all criticism			0
we 're all well aware of sir @entity277 's hairdryer , but on the other side he was a father figure who knew everything about every player from the top to the bottom of @entity263			1
@entity283 completely lacks that understanding side			0
with their player recruitment and his dictatorial style i think tricky times lie ahead			1
@entity289 will be sitting watching the results , shaking his head , thinking if he had all that money to spend , where would they be now ?			0

@entity2 boss @entity3 's woes remind me of when i was at @entity15
it can be tough on the touchline whether you 're at the top or bottom
@entity72 's winner for @entity79 against @entity65 cost me £ 50
@entity148 was out of order in his criticism of @entity143 , but i use exactly the same pod system with senior players that he supports
@entity197 will have success as a striker in the @entity212
tricky times lie ahead for @entity263 under @entity261
