a man claims he has only 100 orgasms before he loses his ability to get an erection forever			1
the 34 - year - old , known only as ‘ rls ’ , says doctors have diagnosed him with a rare condition which means each time he ejaculates , scar tissue will form in his penis			1
eventually , the build up of scar tissue will mean he will no longer be able to achieve an erection , he says			1
he claims he has seen a range of doctors who are unable to explain the cause of his condition			1
a man claims doctors have said he only has 100 orgasms left before he loses his ability to get an erection forever			1
he apparently has a condition where hard scar tissue forms in his penis each time he is aroused , which will eventually make it impossible for his penis to become erect			1
posed by model they have called it ‘ idiopathic fibrosis of the corpora cavernosa ’ – which essentially means unexplained fibrous tissue - hard , scar tissue - forming in the penis			1
however , doctors have told @entity34 that while fibrosis – the build up of scar tissue – in the penis which leads to impotence is possible , it would be impossible to predict the exact number of orgasms a man would have before his penis ‘ stopped working ’			1
in a post on the website @entity45 , @entity6 , who lives in the @entity48 , said he has now seen the ‘ full battery of experts ’ and specialists			1
he said : ‘ basically , there ’s a reservoir in your penis that fills with blood when you have an erection			2
' in my case , every time i get one , it causes an autoimmune reaction [ where the body 's immune system attacks and destroys healthy tissue by mistake ] which causes a scar tissue build - up in the reservoir			1
‘ ultimately , the scar tissue will make it impossible to ever get [ an erection ] again			1
' he has apparently been told he is the first case anyone has ever seen - and has left doctors baffled			1
fibrosis of the penis is a symptom of a rare condition called @entity81 ’s disease , which usually affects men over 40 years old – although it can happen to men of any age			1
a thickened area or one or more hard lumps form in the shaft of the penis			0
as a result , it can become curved , and men can experience pain during an erection , or are sometimes unable to get one			2
doctors do not exactly what causes @entity81 ’s disease , but it has been linked to an injury or repeated blows to the penis , and is associated with low testosterone levels			2
but @entity6 says these explanations do n’t apply to him			2
the man says he has not worn briefs or experienced an injury to his genitalia , so doctors are baffled as to what is causing the build up of scar tissue he says he does n’t wear briefs or use saunas , and has experienced no blunt force to his genitals - and so his case has baffled doctors			1
in his post , @entity6 says he has now accepted he will eventually lose his ability to get an erection , after trying every therapy possible			1
he said : ‘ i ’m 34 years old and i have a finite amount of real , working , orgasm - capable erections remaining			2
they estimate i have about a hundred nuts left			0
’ despite trying every conceivable therapy and medication available , nothing works , he says			0
therefore , he says he has been through the ‘ five stages of grief ’ and accepted he will be impotent in future			0
but while he is able to accept his fate , he says he still does n’t know how to cope with it			2
he has to refrain from masturbation , and feels he needs to be selective with women			1
he said : ‘ lately , i ’m terrified of sex itself			0
i slept with one woman since the diagnosis , but when she wanted to go for a second round , a wave of incredible panic swept over me			0
‘ i burst into a cold sweat and my chest felt like it was gon na cave in on itself			0
‘ since then i ’ve been chaste as a nun , but i toss and turn all night with crazy , disturbing sex dreams , and now i ’m worried that i ’ll lose a nut to a wet dream			0
’ he is now searching for others that might be suffering from the same condition , and wants to start a dialogue about how men can cope with the knowledge they might be impotent in the near future			1
but doctors contacted by @entity34 said they were sceptical about @entity6 ’ diagnosis			1
professor @entity157 , a consultant urologist at @entity158 , said he was not convinced			0
he told @entity34 : ‘ “ idiopathic ” means “ unexplained ”			0
there are conditions like fibrosis which makes blood flow to the penis impossible			2
‘ but there are lots of causes of fibrosis , such as trauma			0
‘ there would always be a cause of fibrosis in such a young man , and doctors should be able to find it			2
‘ it sounds like his problem is either psychogenic , or he ’s suffering from @entity81 ’s disease			0
’ another urologist told @entity34 it would be ‘ impossible ’ to predict how many times a man with fibrosis could ejaculate before suffering erectile dysfunction			1
and dr @entity186 , a consultant urologist at @entity187 and a spokesperson for @entity189 , said @entity6 ’ diagnosis sounded ‘ implausible ’			2
he told @entity34 : ' you can get fibrosis and scarring , usually caused by blood flow problems to the penis			0
‘ but it would n’t stop him ejaculating as that ’s a different mechanism			0
‘ blood flow is n’t related to usage – fibrosis would n’t be made worse by sex , in fact it might improve			0
‘ there is blood flow through the penis all the time			0
' therefore it 's difficult to conceive why getting an erection would cause an autoimmune reaction to blood , when it ’s flowing through the penis all the time			1
‘ ejaculation and erection are two separate mechanisms			0
if you get fibrosis you may lose an erection			0
there are men with fibrosis who can climax and ejaculate but they ca n’t get an erection			2
‘ it ’s possible he has @entity81 ’s disease , but that ’s normally in much older men and it ’s very rare			0
' however there is a theory that @entity81 ’s disease has an autoimmune function			0

@entity48 man , 34 , known as @entity6 , says his condition has baffled doctors
each time he has an erection , it causes a reaction where scar tissue forms
eventually the scar tissue will make an erection impossible , he says
now he *avoids* masturbation and has to be selective with women
wants to open up dialogue about how men can accept sexual dysfunction
