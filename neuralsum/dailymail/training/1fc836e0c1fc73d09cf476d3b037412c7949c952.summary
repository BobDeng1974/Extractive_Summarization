girls can enjoy tech and science , and boys love arts and crafts too - why turn them away ? it 's especially good that @entity2 are tackling their packaging too , as the problem of sexism in the toyshop goes far beyond just the retailers ’ signs			0
' in many stores , pink - and - blue colour coding , gender - specific packaging and promotion of toys continue to send the message that some interests are only for boys , and others only for girls			0
' @entity2 ’s announcement is part of a wider trend on the high street			0

@entity2 's announcement is part of a wider trend on the high street , which has seen twelve toys retailers agreeing to take down gendered signs @entity40 from @entity72 said , ' we 're really pleased that @entity2 have publicly committed to leave behind these outdated stereotypes ' @entity88 , founder of @entity30 says : ' i understand that for some people this may sound like a minor issue , but it is n't until you have heard the hundreds of stories we 've received about little girls genuinely believing they ' are n't allowed ' to be doctors because science is a ' boy thing ' , or asking if they can be turned into a boy so they can go into space , that you realise the true impact gendered toy marketing really does have on young children			2
' why cordon off science , adventure , technology and engineering as ' boys ' toys ' from such a young age when only one in ten @entity75 engineers is female and we 're struggling to recruit enough women into @entity119 careers ? ' why send the message to boys at a young age that dolls , or cooking are only ' for girls ' ? do n't we want them to grow up to be great parents and partners too ? it 's the sort of issue that some people will scoff at , but when you stop and really think about it , removing gendered toy division really is an important step forward			0
' @entity2 say on the issue : we offer a wide range of fun and educational toys which are designed to appeal to children regardless of gender			0
' we always listen carefully to feedback from our customers and based on this a decision was made earlier this year that by spring next year all our toys will be gender neutral			2
