@entity2 girls who are joined at the chest and share the same heart ' will have to remain together ' , doctors have said			1
the conjoined twins , @entity6 and @entity7 , from @entity8 , were born five months ago , and it was unclear whether an operation could be carried out to separate them			1
now , surgeon dr @entity11 , who is caring for the girls , said : ' the twins were sent to have tests done now that they are five - months - old			1
' the conclusion is that the girls hearts are joined , and as a result the babies will have to remain together			1
' @entity6 and @entity7 , now five months old , were born joined at the chest and share one heart tests have been carried out and doctors now say they will never be separated , as they were born with a heart defect which results in low levels of oxygen in their blood experts said the twins were born with a @entity30 heart , a condition which results in low levels of oxygen in the blood , and usually leads to a shorter life span in children			1
dr @entity36 added : ' the heart condition means that it 's impossible to separate them and it would also be out of the question to remove one so that the other might live and develop normally			2
' @entity7 and @entity6 are having tests done at the @entity43 , but will shortly return to @entity44 , in the @entity8 province of @entity46 , where they were born , and will remain there for the future			1
their father @entity49 , 41 , said that as long as the twins were alive they would care for them and give them as much love as possible			1
he said : ' as long as they are here it is heaven 's will , and we will care for them			1
' the twins , who are joined at the chest and face each other , are known as ' thoracopagus ' twins			2
this is the most common type of cojoined twins : 40 per cent are in this group , according to the @entity66			1
mother @entity67 and father @entity49 said as long as the twins were alive they would give them as much love as possible			1
mr @entity49 said : ' as long as they are here it is heaven 's will , and we will care for them ' dr @entity76 , who is treating the girls , says it would be ' out of the question ' to remove one so that the other might live and develop normally in about 75 per cent of cases , such as @entity6 and @entity7 's , thoracopagus twins share one heart			1
twins joined at the chest may also share their liver , biliary tract ( which carries bile from the liver to the small intestine ) and upper digestive tract			2
they are normally delivered by @entity93 section as a vaginal birth is too difficult for the mother and babies			2
only 35 per cent of cojoined twins survive for one day after birth , according to the @entity98			1
however , among those who survive more than a day after birth , some continue to live for days , weeks , months or years while conjoined			1
some live into adulthood still physically connected to each other			0
in december 2014 , @entity105 reported on the brith of @entity107 and @entity108 , who were born in @entity109			2
they can never be separated as they share one heart and one circulatory system in december 2014 @entity105 reported on the case of conjoined twin brothers who share the same body and also share the same heart , who were born in @entity109 , @entity119			1
@entity107 and @entity108 can never be separated as they have a condition known as dicephalic parapagus - an extremely unusual form of conjoinment , affecting only one - in - a - million births			0
they will have to remain together because they share one heart and one circulatory system			1
the rare and extremely risky pregnancy carried through to 37 weeks and @entity128 and @entity129 traveled from @entity130 , @entity119 , to @entity109 's @entity131 for specialist care			2
conjoined twins are two children physically connected to each other at some point in their bodies			1
the lowest odds of this happening are 200,000 to one for every live birth and around 70 percent of conjoined twins are female			1
conjoined twins are always the same sex and the form of conjoined twinning refers directly to where they are joined			2
the most most frequent are horacopagus ( heart , liver , intestine ) , omphalopagus ( liver , biliary tree , intestine ) , pygopagus ( spine , rectum , genitourinary tract ) , ischiopagus ( pelvis , liver , intestine , genitourinary tract ) , and craniopagus ( brain , meninges )			2
( @entity162 ) experts think that conjoined twins come from a single egg that fails to separate			1
around 200 conjoined twins are born each year and around half die before their first birthday			1
@entity169 and @entity170 , ten , were born joined at the head , but their parents left them in their local hospital in @entity174 , @entity175 because they could not pay their medical expenses			2
for eight years the girls have eaten , played and slept in one room at @entity179 and have been cared for by nursing staff			0
they can not be separated			0
their doctor , dr @entity181 , a paediatric surgeon , is trying to find an international surgeon who specialises in neurology to perform the operation			0
he said : ' it has always been possible to operate on the girls because they both have individual brains			0
' the problem lies with the one main blood vessel they share so it does have its risks			0
' @entity193 and @entity194 caught the attention of the world when at the age of 29 they decided to have surgery to separate			0
the sister 's skulls were joined above the ear but each of their brains was intact			0
they were never able to look into one another 's face without the aid of a mirror			0
their dream was to walk out of @entity212 in @entity213 and walk in opposite directions			0
sadly they both died after their surgery			0
born in @entity218 in 1974 , they developed different personalities and made separate groups of friends			2
@entity194 was the stronger personality and was more talkative , while @entity193 was quieter			0
so when @entity194 said she was determined to become a lawyer , @entity193 had no choice but to study law with her			0
conjoined twins @entity226 and @entity228 caused quite a stir when they were born in @entity175 , with some people in their village worshipping them as divine incarnations			1
and while one doctor has said that it would be possible to separate the 12 - year - olds , who were born joined at the waist , the duo are determined to remain together			1
@entity228 said : ‘ we do n't wish to get separated			0
we will stay like this even when we grow old			0
we want to live as we are			0
’ the pair , who were born in a tiny village near @entity243 in central @entity175 , share two legs and four arms and work in tandem to get around			2
they have stunned doctors with their ability to wash , dress and feed themselves			0
a local doctor told the family they were both healthy but he could not separate them			0
they are believed to share the same stomach but have independent lungs , hearts and brains			0
with practice they have learned to do all their basic daily chores with minimal fuss , including showering , eating , getting dressed and combing each other 's hair			0
they are able to walk down the stairs of their simple split - level home and even run on all six limbs to play cricket and other games with neighboring children .			0
