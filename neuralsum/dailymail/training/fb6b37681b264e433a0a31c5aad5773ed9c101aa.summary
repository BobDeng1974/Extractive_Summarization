defence solicitor @entity31 said : ' after very lengthy discussions with his doctor , who has known him for many years , it became clear there was nothing medically that could have caused this type of behaviour			0
' i have spoken at length with the boy and his parents and advised them of the consequences of a guilty plea and the decision they have taken , on the basis of my advice , is that he will plead guilty to all the charges			2
