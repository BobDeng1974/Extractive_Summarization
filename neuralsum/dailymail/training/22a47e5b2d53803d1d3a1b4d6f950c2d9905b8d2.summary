by @entity0 researchers have revealed a newfound alien planet might be able to support life - and say it is just 16 light years away			1
called @entity6 , it is a ' super-earth ' at least five times as massive as our planet			1
the researchers say it might be the closest in terms of conditions ever found - and may even have @entity15 - like temperatures , albeit with large seasonal shifts			1
the planet , known as @entity6 , lies just 16 light - years from @entity15			1
the @entity26 galaxy is about 100,000 light - years wide ; the closest star to @entity15 , @entity28 , is 4.2 light - years away			1
an international team of astronomers says the exoplanet is in the star @entity21 's ' habitable zone , ' the just - right range of distances that could allow liquid water to exist on a world 's surface			0
@entity21 832c orbits its host star every 36 days			0
however , the host star is a red dwarf that 's much dimmer and cooler than our sun , so @entity21 832c receives about as much stellar energy as @entity15 does , despite orbiting much closer to its parent , researchers said			2
' this makes @entity21 c one of the top three most @entity15 - like planets and the closest one to @entity15 of all three , a prime object for follow - up observations , ' said @entity55 , director of the @entity56 at the @entity57 at @entity58			2
' the planet might have @entity15 - like temperatures , albeit with large seasonal shifts , given a similar terrestrial atmosphere			1
' however , other unknowns such as the bulk composition and atmosphere of the planet could make this world quite different to @entity15 and non-habitable , they warn			2
called @entity6 , the new planet is a ' super-earth ' at least five times as massive as our planet			1
' so far , the two planets of @entity21 are a scaled - down version of our own @entity77 , with an inner potentially @entity15 - like planet and an outer @entity81 - like giant planet , ' the team wrote			1
' the giant planet may well played a similar dynamical role in the @entity21 system to that played by @entity81 in our @entity77			0
' this star is already known to harbour a cold @entity81 - like planet , @entity89 , discovered on 2009			0
the new planet , @entity91 , was added to the @entity92 along with a total of 23 objects of interest			0
the number of planets in the catalog has almost doubled this year alone			0
the @entity92 now has 23 objects of interest including @entity91 , the closest to @entity15 of the top three most @entity15 - like worlds in the catalog			2
a team led by @entity104 , of the @entity105 in @entity106 , discovered @entity21 832c by noticing the tiny wobbles the planet 's gravity induces in the motion of its host star			0
they spotted these wobbles in data gathered by three separate instruments â€” the @entity116 on the @entity117 in @entity106 , the @entity118 on the @entity120 telescope in @entity121 and the @entity122 ( @entity122 ) spectrograph , which is part of the @entity125 's 11.8 - foot ( 3.6 meters ) telescope at the @entity126 in @entity121 .			0

the planet , known as @entity6 , lies just 16 light - years from @entity15
is a ' super-earth ' at least five times as massive as our planet
might have @entity15 - like temperatures , albeit with large seasonal shifts
