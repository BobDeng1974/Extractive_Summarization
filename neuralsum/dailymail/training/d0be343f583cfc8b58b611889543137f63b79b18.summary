he 's seen in a bath with the brand 's bag beside him champions : mr @entity15 is also seen in another leaked image with former @entity37 gymnast @entity36 ( left ) if the photographs were in fact due for release on august 16 and a rogue individual had simply leaked them , mr @entity15 will be in the clear			1
but if the photos were in fact leaked intentionally by the brand , the sporting hero will face punishment			0
