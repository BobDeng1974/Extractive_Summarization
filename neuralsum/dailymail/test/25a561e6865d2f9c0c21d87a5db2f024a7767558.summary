you ’ve found the house of your dreams – but you want to make sure the costly nightmare of dry rot is n’t lurking under the carpets and skirting boards			1
the solution ? call in the dogs ! the appropriately named @entity9 has trained his two animals to sniff out the destructive fungus in old houses where it can hide in places a person would miss. mr @entity9 gave up a ten - year career in construction after hitting on the idea to set up a business using the animals ’ sense of smell , which is said to be up to a million times better than that of humans			1
skilled : @entity26 and @entity27 , pictured with @entity9 , were trained for six months to sniff out dry rot on the case : four - year - old border collie @entity26 gets down to work sniffing out the destructive fungus when they find dry rot they stop , stare at it and point with their nose , only moving from the affected area when mr @entity9 gives them a special signal after six months of training , four - year - old border collie @entity26 and 22 - month - old @entity27 went to work			1
when they find dry rot they stop , stare at it and point with their nose , only moving from the affected area when mr @entity9 gives them a special signal			1
the businessman , 30 , from @entity49 , whose company is called @entity51 , said : ‘ we ’re unique in offering a dry rot detection service using dogs to the public			1
the dogs can go out to domestic properties or surveyors can hire us as part of their report			0
dry rot is wood decay caused by the fungus @entity64 that digests the parts of the wood which give it strength			1
by the time there are visible signs , serious damage will have been done			0
it begins as a microscopic spore but the final stage is a fruiting body which pumps out new spores			0
once airborne they can damage all parts of a property , penetrating brickwork and concrete floors seeking a wood source			0
if not treated , it can destroy a building			0
“ it ’s not really work for the dogs – they see it as the best game in the world and they enjoy it because it ’s working on their natural instincts			0
the dogs are so effective because they can detect dry rot at much earlier stages			1
‘ in hidden places dry rot can grow for years without anyone noticing it			2
it can be hard to find but the dogs can detect it through carpet and wall panelling			2
‘ it takes a couple of minutes for the dog to search a room			0
people are slightly dubious when they first hear about us but after seeing what we can do they ’re amazed			0
’ prices start at £ 200 for a call - out and the business has been so successful mr @entity9 plans to expand it by training the dogs to hunt out bed bugs for hotels and hospitals			2
