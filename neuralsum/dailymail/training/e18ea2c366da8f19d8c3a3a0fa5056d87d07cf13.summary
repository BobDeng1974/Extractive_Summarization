by @entity0 published : 15:19 est , 19 march 2014 updated : 15:29 est , 19 march 2014 a pub owner has riled gun enthusiasts by putting up a sign in his window banning firearms from the establishment and calling those who carry them ' losers '			1
the owner of the @entity12 in @entity13 , @entity14 , put up his potentially provocative handmade sign around @entity16			1
the full notice read : ' no concealed weapons allowed			2
' if you are such a loser that you feel a need to carry a gun with you when you go out , i do not want your business			2
d * * * * bag			1

previously , the bar and restaurant averaged three out of five stars on @entity37			0
it also had mainly positive reviews on its @entity41 page			0
but after the sign was spotted by gun advocates online , that rating has nosedived			1
now the bar has over 300 reviews - it previously only had three - by people who allegedly found the pub had ' bad service ' and was ' overpriced '			2
one of the users even posted on the pub 's @entity41 page claiming she : ' threw my guts up for three days straight after eating the wings			2
' another user , @entity58 , said : ' not very good food ... very bad service			0
. the kind of place you see on those restaurant fix it shows			0
@entity66 added : ' get one star because it 's not letting me put zero			1
did n't like the bar and did n't like the sign up dogging concealed carriers and calling us d * * * * bags			1
wo n't spend my money at some bigots c * * * shack			1

if you do n't like it @entity93 is to the north and @entity97 to the south so feel free			0
' hitting back , the pub 's owner wrote : ' sorry , but i 'm not sorry			0
if you feel the need to bring a gun into a college bar you are a douche bag			0
' and if you 're drinking than you are violating the law			0
' perhaps fueling the fire , the man later wrote he himself is a gun owner who did not like ' irrational ... gun nuts '			0
he then posted pictures of more permanent - looking signs - which were yet again blasted by users			0
last month , @entity14 passed a law which allows licensed pistol owners to take concealed weapons into pubs and bars - as long as they do n't drink while inside			1
