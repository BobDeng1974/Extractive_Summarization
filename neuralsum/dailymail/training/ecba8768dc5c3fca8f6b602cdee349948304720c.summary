by @entity0 for @entity1 author and advertising expert @entity2 said she ' was making a historical analogy ' when she compared housewives to prostitutes on @entity7 last night			1
the discussion on the @entity10 television program , which featured an all female panel , veered into a debate about sex work last night			2
off the back of recent stories about how journalist @entity17 became a sex worker , the panel was asked : ' what do you think of prostitution as a conscious career choice in a first world country ? ' in remarks that have caused some controversy , ms @entity2 replied : ' well , i 'm going to say something really dangerous now			1
' ' for example , i would argue that traditional marriage , which included conjugal rights , particularly when women were not able to go to work or fired when they first got married , were basically selling their bodies and their reproductive rights to their husband			1
' he bought them , by giving her room and board in return , was a form of prostitution			0
' so i think we really have to discuss what we mean by prostitution			0
' at least the women who choose it as a career choice , freely and uncoerced , that 's very very important , only have to put up with him for about an hour			2
' ' @entity73 it was a lifetime ladies , a lifetime			0
' fellow panelist @entity77 author @entity76 rejected ms @entity2 's remarks as an ' an abstract comparison ' as some sex workers have up to 15 buyers a day			1
ms @entity2 , who copped flak on social media for the remarks , told @entity1 she was referring to a time when women were fired from their jobs when they got married and unwanted sexual congress was not considered rape if they were married			1
she said she was not talking about current housewives			2
ms @entity2 engaged in a back - and - forth over the matter with fellow panelist @entity77 author @entity76 one of several tweets aimed at @entity2 last night			1
another tweet aimed at ms @entity2			1
' @entity94 ' is an acronym for ' @entity96 '			0
' she was obliged to say yes ( to sex )			0
in return , she got room and board ... it was a historical analogy			2
' ' i 'm a bit annoyed i 'm getting tweets saying you think stay at home housewives are common whores			2
no. i never said such a thing			0
' ' i 'm not saying women chose to be this way			0
everyone 's misconstruing it saying " you 're calling grandmother a prostitute			1
" ' ' women were placed in a situation where they really did n't have a choice			0
' as part of a panel which included @entity123 journalist @entity122 , editor @entity124 and authors @entity125 and @entity127 , ms @entity2 also implored young women to always say what they think			1
' my advice is to be yourself			0
do not allow anyone to mould your shape that does n't feel anyone like you			0
' ' be yourself , and always say what you think			0
' ms @entity2 said she would give precisely the same advice to young men .			1
