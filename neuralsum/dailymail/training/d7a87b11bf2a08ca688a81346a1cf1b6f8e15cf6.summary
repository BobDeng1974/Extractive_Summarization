@entity1 put @entity2 on the insurance for the @entity5 tour when friends knew she was suffering from depression , it was sensationally claimed last night			1
in an extraordinary report the @entity8 raises questions about what mr @entity1 should or could have known of his girlfriend ’s struggles when he added her to the $ 13 million policy			1
the newspaper also said that miss @entity2 was due to visit a psychotherapist the day she died and that she refused to take antidepressants despite apparently being advised to do so			1
pictured are @entity1 and miss @entity2 the @entity5 have launched a $ 13 million lawsuit against their insurers after miss @entity2 hanged herself on march 17 at her luxury @entity28 apartment			1
they say they are entitled to the money because they had to postpone the @entity21 and @entity22 leg of their world tour because mr @entity1 , 71 , was ‘ stricken with grief ’ and told not to perform for 30 days			1
it is unclear when ms @entity2 ’s name was added to the @entity5 ’ insurance policy			1
the @entity39 - based group of 12 insurers however are refusing because they say miss @entity2 ’s death was by her own hand and not ‘ unforeseen ’ because she has had pre-existing mental issues			1
court documents made public this week reveal that miss @entity2 , who died at the age of 49 , was on the long list of family members who would trigger a payout if they were injured or killed			1
the original insurance policy document , which the @entity5 signed up to , states that to the best of their knowledge ' no insured person has any physical , mental or medical condition or is undergoing any treatment , medical or otherwise , other than those advised to the insurers			2
' a later clause says that this does not just cover the band but also those on the list of family members , which includes miss @entity2			1
veteran @entity8 show business columnist @entity63 wrote that miss @entity2 was so disturbed that she posted alarming images on her @entity67 page in the days before she died			1
one of them was a photograph of @entity70 strangling a goose which she had captioned ‘ # fashionmoment ’ , which was deleted after her death			0
her @entity75 account showed a very different life , however , and featured glamorous shots of her posing on rooftops and wearing expensive clothes in far flung locations			0
@entity1 was ' diagnosed as suffering from acute traumatic stress disorder ' after @entity84 's death journalist @entity85 , who investigated miss @entity2 ’s death for @entity86 , told the @entity8 : ‘ her friends knew she was cripplingly depressed			1
‘ it ’s my understanding she refused to take antidepressants			2
’ miss @entity2 ’s friend @entity91 was supposedly the one who would take her to therapy the day she died			2
instead the designer , who was feted by the likes of @entity94 , texted her @entity99 assistant @entity98 to ‘ come by ’ to her home , which is where she found the body			0
it has since emerged that @entity101 , miss @entity2 ’s @entity39 - based company , owed £ 5.4 million and had to pay £ 850,000 of debts within a year			2
she was reportedly ‘ embarrassed ’ by her business problems , which were so severe she had struggled to pay her staff and suppliers			0
when mr @entity1 found out about her death , the papers reveal that he was so upset he was diagnosed with acute traumatic stress disorder , which can lead to nightmares and strong feelings of guilt			1
the @entity5 postponed seven dates on their 14 - date on fire tour but after adding 13 more dates they are on course to rake in a staggering £ 62 million for the entire operation			0
they sued their underwriters at the @entity118 in @entity39 but the insurers retaliated by claiming that it was ‘ reasonable to infer miss @entity2 had been suffering from a mental illness ’ , though they produced no proof to back this up			2
such a condition was ‘ traceable to , or accelerated by , a condition for which she had received or been recommended medical attention ’ , they claimed			0
miss @entity91 ’s publicist said : ‘ @entity91 would never comment on this			0
she will always protect the privacy of @entity130			0
’ nobody for the @entity5 or mr @entity1 was available for comment			2
court documents revealed that @entity1 has 18 people on his insurance policy , including ms @entity2 , @entity136 , seven children and four grandchildren the @entity5 frontman published a statement on his website soon after @entity2 's death saying he was struggling to understand why she would end her life hell - raisers : @entity145 and @entity146 the @entity5 may still be going strong , but their court documents reveal that their disgruntled insurers are well aware of the toll taken by years of the rockstar lifestyle			1
hidden among the fine print of their tour insurance policy is a long list of exceptions – health issues for which each member of the ageing band is not covered			2
for example , and perhaps not surprisingly , the insurers say they will not pay out if anything happens to guitarist @entity146 related to ‘ alcohol abuse , liver failure and / or disease and osteoarthritis ’			0
more unusually , anything to do with the injury that he suffered in 2006 , when he was hit on the head by a coconut , will not be covered either			0
for @entity145 , anything to do with ‘ alcohol abuse ’ is also not covered			0
the exemptions for drummer @entity173 include any conditions related to the cancer he was diagnosed with in 2004 or his sciatica			0
the documents show the band expected to receive £ 28million for their tour			0
just three shows in @entity182 were worth £ 9million .			0

sensational claim that @entity1 should have known his lover was ' refusing antidepressants '
@entity1 diagnosed with traumatic stress disorder after @entity2 died
doctors warned him not to perform for a month , according to court papers
the stones were forced to postpone @entity21 and @entity22 leg of tour
but their insurers refused to pay out as policy did not cover *suicide*
