there was an hour of daylight left in the @entity3 desert when we hopped into the @entity5			1
our guide , @entity7 , revved the engine - in another life he might have been a rally driver - and off we set			1
‘ dune bashing ! ’ cried @entity7 , encouraged by squawks of delight from our youngest daughter , aged ten			1
@entity14 and dirty in the dust : @entity16 is a great place to try the very modern motorised pastime of dune - bashing @entity16 ’s @entity20 are classic desert terrain - the sort you get in a @entity25 film or one of those ‘ parched man crawls towards oasis ’ newspaper cartoons			1
@entity29 of sand stretched to the horizon			1
what was most striking was the colours , at once uniform and subtly different			2
the sand was all yellow , of course , but there were valleys of brown and black , too , lengthening as the golden sun dropped			1
we surged over and through the dunes			2
‘ snowplough ! ’ i yelled when we seemed to be going down an incline far too steeply - and the car , thrillingly , was skidding sideways , throwing out a high spray of sand			1
where desert meets water : the @entity3 capital @entity52 has a picturesque charm and an undiscovered vibe our children cackled with laughter			1
the moment we stepped out of the 4x4 , there came a contrast : complete , refreshing silence as we sat on the dune tops and watched the sun set on this astonishing landscape			1
this was the reason i ’d dug deep into the family savings and chosen @entity16 for a week ’s holiday over @entity71			1
it lived up to every expectation			2
the @entity74 of @entity16 , long an ally of @entity76 , lies east of @entity77			0
to its south is troubled @entity80			0
@entity82 flights from @entity83 take seven hours to reach the @entity3 capital @entity52			1
for the first four days , we had the company of speed - merchant @entity87			1
he took us to the fortified town of @entity90 , where a splendidly busy and smelly livestock market is held on fridays			0
the nut sellers in the souk had copped on to the idea of overcharging @entity97 tourists — when my wife asked for a small bag of cashews , she was charged the @entity3 rial equivalent of £ 3			1
‘ you should have haggled , ’ i said			0
she told me she would have felt mean			0
‘ they expect and enjoy haggling , ’ insisted @entity7			0
@entity90 has a restored fort that could have been the setting for @entity108			0
i was half expecting to find @entity109 round the next turret			0
a solid day 's work : fishing is still an important part of life in the @entity116 district of @entity52 even better than @entity90 ’s fort was the one at @entity118 , where a 17th - century sultan reclined with dates , concubines and political worries			1
his reception room had hidey holes from which his henchmen could pounce to slay visitors			0
and his fortifications had gizmos worthy of @entity129 : false steps on stairs down where attackers might plunge to their deaths , and ‘ killing holes ’ through which boiling - hot date syrup could be poured			1
the beautiful @entity136 room , meanwhile , was cleverly designed to keep the ruler cool by day and silver - lit by night			1
@entity16 ’s mountains are a purpling grey , and water is precious			0
where the irrigation projects have not yet reached , you see blue water lorries labouring up roads			0
government infrastructure work is everywhere			0
since 1970 , the country has been wrenched from medieval times into the 21st century , yet its people remain gracious and attractively modest			0
although @entity97 tourists are welcomed , women are urged to dress discreetly in the streets ( no short skirts , low - cut tops or bare shoulders )			1
pleased to meet you : though a different prospect to @entity157 , @entity16 is a place that offers a warm welcome nor would you ever go to @entity16 for a @entity97 stag night - alcohol is not plentiful			1
we spent a night on the country ’s tallest mountain , 9,800ft @entity165 , which has a not - so - mini ‘ @entity166 ’			2
our accommodation at the @entity168 was odd - freezing - cold , prefab huts with mod - con bathrooms worthy of a @entity172 hotel			2
but true to its name , it had a fine view of the plain below			0
the nearby village of @entity179 was a delight , an oasis perched on a hill with banana trees and palms			0
my wife was so enchanted by one deep - gorge wadi we visited that she has kept drawing pictures of it since we got home			2
in the desert , we stayed at another camp where the sleeping quarters were @entity196 - style tents , and evening entertainment was provided by a discordant band of bongo drummers and overweight dancing ladies			2
for supper , the staff produced a side of spiced lamb that had been cooking for 24 hours			0
gosh , it was cold that night			0
but our children found it all fascinating - and they even got to grips with a few hesitant words of @entity209			2
meeting the local wildlife : it is almost impossible to travel through @entity16 without spotting a camel or two the least interesting part of the trip was when we returned towards @entity52 and had a few nights at the opulent ( but pricey ) @entity216			1
great pools , comfortable rooms , but we could have been in @entity219 , complete with a clientele of bored white bankers and their pouting girlfriends			0
we did manage to escape into the city , however , and visit the souk , with its goodly whiff of frankincense , the fish market ( rather different smells there ) and the @entity231 , which was completed in 2001			2
the chandelier in the mosque ’s main chamber has more than 1,000 bulbs - just think of the electricity bills ! the mosque complex , which can accommodate 20,000 worshippers , is a monument to cultural and national self - confidence in a country blessed with rich natural resources and a lingering @entity244 mystique			2
@entity245 ( 01242 854 133 , www.abercrombiekent.co.uk ) offers eight nights in @entity16 from £ 1,675 per adult , based on two sharing			0
children under 12 are an additional £ 1,025 pp based on two sharing , including return flights with @entity82 .			0

@entity157 's next - door *neighbour* has plenty to offer as a holiday *destination*
dune - bashing - driving on huge piles of sand in a @entity258 - is a key attraction
@entity52 , the @entity3 capital , is an *intriguing* city of *history* , culture and *luxury*
