by @entity0 published : 04:04 est , 1 october 2012 updated : 09:39 est , 1 october 2012 the @entity2 feminist band @entity3 have refused to repent for performing an @entity5 ' punk prayer ' in @entity7 's main cathedral as their appeal hearing was postponed until next week			1
the three band members @entity11 , 22 , @entity12 , 24 , and @entity13 , 30 , - were convicted of ' hooliganism motivated by religious hatred ' and jailed for two years by a district court on aug 17			1
their appeal hearing which began today , was postponed until october 10 after @entity13 fired her attorney meaning she was left without legal representation			1
fights broke out between @entity3 supporters and @entity32 activists as around 150 people gathered outside the @entity7 courthouse for the start of the appeal hearing today			1
the tough jail sentences they received saw the @entity39 sharply criticise @entity5 and the @entity40 because of doubts over the independence of the judiciary , and global celebrities , including @entity46 musician @entity45 and @entity48 pop singer @entity47 , called for leniency for the women			0

around 150 people gathered outside the @entity7 courthouse for the start of the appeal hearing with fights breaking out between supporters of the band and @entity25 activists @entity64 , a senior church spokesman , said their stunt ' must not remain unpunished whatever the justification , ' but said that any repentance , if expressed , should be taken into account			1
' the church sincerely wishes for the repentance of those who desecrated a holy place , certainly it would benefit their souls , ' @entity64 said in a speech			2
' if any words of the convicts indicate repentance ... we would wish that they are not left unnoticed and those who violated the law get a chance to mend their ways			0
' ' if they ( the church ) mean repentance in the sense of a crime ... it definitely wo n't happen			0
our clients wo n't admit guilt			0
a call for that is pointless , ' lawyer @entity93 told independent television channel @entity96 on sunday			0
a recent official opinion poll showed that more than half of @entity2 are critical of what @entity3 did and consider their two - year jail sentence to be a just one , with less than a third saying the opposite			2
international outrage : an activist spray paints a wall mural in support of members of the band during a protest rally in front of the @entity2 embassy in @entity114 yesterday @entity115 : activists from @entity117 pose in front of the @entity119 demanding justice for the band the trio 's legal team and relatives hold out little hope that the sentences - which they believe are excessively harsh - will be quashed or reduced at the hearing scheduled for monday , whether they repent or not			1
' the sentence is predetermined ; their repentance will not affect it in any way , ' @entity129 , father of one of the jailed women , told @entity136			0
' the fact the church is calling for that is nothing but a public relations move to sustain their reputation in the eyes of the public , as the church says it is separate from the state			0
' patriarch @entity148 , the head of the @entity25 , has called @entity5 's 12 - year rule a ' miracle of @entity151 ' and backed his presidential election campaign earlier this year			2
@entity148 dismissed criticism of his backing for the @entity40 on friday , telling students that close ties between the church and state helped protect and develop society			0
