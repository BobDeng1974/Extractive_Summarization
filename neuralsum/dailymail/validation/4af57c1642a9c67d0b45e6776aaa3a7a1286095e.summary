@entity2 ’s @entity1 record is as phenomenal as it is deeply disappointing			1
the paradox is apparent is @entity2 ’s own mantra , oft repeated , that the club ’s record of qualifying for the tournament for 17 consecutive years and having reached the equivalent of knock - out stages for the last 15 years is extraordinary			1
yet having contested the @entity1 and its predecessor the @entity1 18 times now ( including twice at @entity11 ) , he has never won it			1
perhaps more damningly he has been in the final just once and the semi-finals three times , once with @entity11 and twice with @entity14			1
@entity2 is undoubtedly one of the managerial greats but his @entity17 record is a blot on his cv @entity2 leads his @entity14 side against @entity11 on tuesday night hoping to turn around a 3 - 1 deficit @entity2 looks towards the @entity1 trophy after losing the 2006 final to @entity23 in @entity24 progression to the quarter - finals of the @entity1 would require @entity14 to do what no other side has done in the @entity1 - overturn a two - goal home leg deficit			1
so to inspire the team , @entity14 fans have taken to @entity32 and created the hashtag # @entity34 in the hope of inspiring their side to a famous victory , with the topic now trending worldwide			2
supporters will hope @entity40 and co can live up to their alter - egos from @entity14 's @entity43 in 2013 where the squad dressed up as superheroes			1
for a manager of such iconic status who for most of those years has overseen one of @entity52 ’s biggest and best - resourced clubs , that is a poor record , which points to his limitations			2
just to be clear , before the debate immediately descends into a pro- or @entity57 polemic , there are shades of grey in this argument			0
@entity2 is undoubtedly one of the great managers and will always be revered as such			2
but his failure to win any @entity17 trophy and to have contested just three finals in 22 years of qualifying for various @entity17 tournaments , is a glaring omission in his career			1
it is why the game against @entity11 is so poignant			1
it is not just that he is returning to where his @entity17 pedigree began			2
it is the fact that this tie should have been the perfect platform for @entity2 to have another go at building a @entity17 success			1
it has n’t turned out that way after that awful , shambolic 3 - 1 defeat in the first leg at the @entity82			1
of course , should @entity14 pull off the most unlikely of comebacks , it will rank as one of his greatest moments in the tournament			2
more significantly , with @entity90 faltering , @entity2 will feel his team , coming nicely into form , has a genuine chance of finally winning it			2
few will agree with him though on analysing his record			0
the failure clearly irks @entity14			2
@entity98 admitted as much last year , when interviewed about @entity2			2
for all the plaudits of the incredible @entity103 team , they themselves sense a gap in their cv			0
‘ when we meet up , the old players , we are very disappointed we have n't won the @entity1 , ’ said @entity98			2
‘ we felt we had a good enough team to win it			0
personally that 's where i have my biggest regrets , because that was a few years that it happened , and internally , the team thought we had a great chance of winning			0
’ the closest @entity2 came to realising his dream was the @entity1 final in 2006 , when ten - man @entity14 led until the 76th minute against @entity23			1
who is to say that @entity14 would n’t have won that day had @entity119 not been sent off ? this is thrust of @entity2 ’s argument when questioned on his record : that the fine margins and necessary luck which plays its part in football is to blame for him not having achieved his goal			1
@entity128 are favourite to progress @entity98 admitted that it was one of the biggest regrets for @entity2 's great side to not win in @entity52 @entity133 reacts after @entity14 lose out in @entity24 , courtesy of goals from @entity136 and @entity137 @entity138 could not inspire @entity14 to victory in @entity2 's only @entity1 final back in 2006 it is compelling up to a point			1
clearly @entity2 is an infinitely better coach than @entity143 and @entity144 , both of whom have won the trophy			2
but judged against his peers , the managerial greats of the modern era , @entity2 ’s record is lacking			2
leave aside for now the fact that @entity153 won the trophy three times in six attempts and @entity157 won it twice in four attempts , in the modern era @entity2 ’s does not rank among the elite group of coaches			0
@entity162 has won the trophy three times in twelve attempts ; @entity165 has won it twice in eleven ( counting this season , as he is already out ) ; @entity168 has won in twice in five attempts			0
and even @entity168 ca n’t match @entity171 record of two wins and four finals in five attempts			0
@entity171 @entity1 ‘ nadir ’ was going out in the semi-final to eventual winners @entity175 in 1991			0
@entity2 looks on as @entity23 lift the trophy - and he is still without a @entity17 trophy in his long career @entity119 was sent off early in the game and @entity23 's pressure eventually told as they beat @entity14 a persistent critique of sir @entity184 ’s ability as a coach ( as opposed to manager ) was that , given his resources he ‘ only ’ won the trophy twice in 21 years			1
he also qualified for the competition three times with @entity191 , but left them to join @entity194 midway through the 1985 - 86 competition			0
@entity11 tonight is the reminder that @entity2 is the consummate qualifier in @entity52 but never the victor			1
in his six years here at the club , the team qualified for @entity17 competition every season , losing in the final of the @entity205 in 1992 to @entity206			1
remarkably , given the relative size of the club , they reached the @entity1 semi-finals in 1994 , losing 3 - 0 to @entity210			1
no disgrace in that , however ; that was @entity214 ’s team which proceeded to take apart @entity23 4 - 0 in the final			0
@entity162 has won the @entity1 three times , including last year , in twelve attempts @entity165 has won the big trophy twice in eleven entries ( counting this season , as he is already out ) @entity171 has a hugely impressive record of two wins and four finals in five @entity1 attempts @entity2 ’s gifts are undeniable			1
but an 18 - year sample should take account of bad luck and the statistical vagaries of football			0
there is a missing link in @entity2 ’s tactical psyche			1
it is as evident in the defensive displays against @entity236 and @entity237 last season as it was against @entity11 two weeks ago			0
it has always been there and it holds him back from being the very best			0
the year he perhaps should have done it but did n’t was not so much 2006 , when that team was beginning to decline , but the invincible year of 2003 - 04 , when a late @entity245 goal at @entity246 knocked @entity14 out in the quarter - finals in the days when @entity2 ’s teams were considerably stronger than @entity236			1
it is a difficult to remember a night when @entity2 has looked more disconsolate			0
he seemed so full of fury that he was on the point of bursting into tears			0
for all the professonial stereotypes , he is a deeply emotional man			0
@entity245 fired in a late @entity236 winner at @entity246 in 2004 in one of @entity14 's best chances of winning bridge 's goal defeated an @entity14 side that were superior to @entity236 and went on to win the @entity260 @entity2 can not hide his disappointment as then - @entity236 manager @entity262 celebrates a rare win nothing would give @entity265 football lovers greater pleasure that to see @entity14 execute a remarkable comeback tonight and for @entity2 to go on and finally lift the trophy ‘ with the big ears , ’ as @entity271 always called it			1
or , at some stage in these , surely the final few years of his career , for him to achieve that goal			0
his reputation demands it and on a sentimental level , having achieved so much , he ’s earned it			0
but the @entity1 is an unforgiving beast			0
it may not be a perfect barometer of coaching ability , but it is quite a good , crude measure of how well you pit your wits against the best minds in football			0
and @entity2 , for all his accolades , comes up short			0
@entity2 is back at his former club @entity11 on tuesday night with the hope of reaching @entity17 glory			1

@entity2 has qualified for the @entity1 for last 17 seasons
but despite his managerial pedigree he *boasts* no @entity17 trophies
iconic boss has only reached on final and three semi-finals
@entity11 game is hugely poignant after 3 - 1 defeat in first leg at the @entity82
@entity14 lost the 2006 final and could have gone on to win the *cup* in 2004
the @entity1 shows missing link in @entity2 's tactical psyche
