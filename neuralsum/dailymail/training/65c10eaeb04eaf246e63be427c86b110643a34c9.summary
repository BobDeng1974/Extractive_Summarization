@entity1 crystal may be the most abundant material on @entity3 , but for centuries scientists have failed to get their hands on this elusive mineral			1
the mysterious substance makes up more than a third of the volume of @entity3 and is mostly found in the planet 's lower mantle 410 to 1,796 miles ( 660 to 2890 km ) beneath the planet 's surface			1
now , for the first time , @entity14 researchers have been able to get a sample of the mineral , and have finally given it a formal name : bridgmanite			1
the mineral was found by @entity21 of the @entity22 , @entity23 , and his team in the @entity26 meteorite , which had experienced intense pressures over a short period of time the mineral , which thought to make up roughly 36 per cent of the planet , was named after @entity32 , a @entity14 physicist who won the 1946 @entity33 for pressure physics			1

' despite appearing for decades in numerous experimental and theoretical studies , characterisations of possible natural samples have not been sufficient to meet @entity41 criteria for naming new minerals , ' professor @entity21 wrote in the journal @entity44			0
the mysterious substance makes up more than a third of the volume of @entity3 and is mostly found in the planet 's lower mantle ( pictured ) 410 to 1,796 miles ( 660 to 2890 km ) beneath the planet 's surface according to @entity41 rules , a mineral can not be given a formal name until a specimen has been found that can be studied first hand			1
' consequently , any detailed chemical , structural , and petrographic analysis of natural [ bridmanite ] has remained impossible , ' professor @entity21 added			0
the @entity26 meteorite hit @entity58 in 1879 after experiencing temperatures of 2000 ° c and pressures of 24 gigapascals – conditions similar to those deep inside the @entity3			1
due to the massive pressures , bridgmanite essentially ' froze ' in place before it could decay , forming crystallites within the meteorite			0
as much as two - thirds of @entity3 's carbon may be hidden in the inner core , making it the planet 's largest carbon reservoir			2
this is according to a new model that even its backers acknowledge is ' provocative and speculative '			0
@entity77 researchers suggest that iron carbide , @entity79 , is a good match for the density and sound velocities of @entity3 's inner core			1
@entity84 " the model of a carbide inner core is compatible with existing cosmochemical , geochemical and petrological constraints , but this provocative and speculative hypothesis still requires further testing , " said professor @entity85			0
' should it hold up to various tests , the model would imply that as much as two - thirds of the planet 's carbon is hidden in its center sphere , making it the largest reservoir of carbon on @entity3			2
" it is now widely accepted that @entity3 's inner core consists of crystalline iron alloyed with a small amount of nickel and some lighter elements			2
however , seismic waves called s waves travel through the inner core at about half the speed expected for most iron - rich alloys under relevant pressures			0
some researchers have attributed the s - wave velocities to the presence of liquid , calling into question the solidity of the inner core			0
the mineral was named after @entity32 ( right ) , a @entity14 physicist who won the 1946 @entity33 for pressure physics			1
it was found in the @entity26 meteorite hit @entity58 in 1879 ( left ) scientists had looked at likely meteorites in the past , but by using electron microscopes to study the material , they ended up inadvertently destroying it			1
this time , the team used a less destructive test using a micro-focused x-ray beam alongside with electronmicroscopy to keep the sample intact			0
its discovery not only allows scientists to finally name the abundant mineral , but also better analyse it to understand how the deep mantle behaves			1
the researchers claim that the sample has more sodium and ferric acid than they had been expected			0
they say it might even hold clues about what goes on when rocky bodies in space when they collide , which may offer insights into how the universe formed			0

mysterious mineral makes up more than a third of the volume of @entity3
because it *resides* in lower mantel , scientists had been unable to see it
@entity14 researchers *recently* found traces of it in a meteorite that hit in 1879
they named it after @entity32 who won a @entity33
it could help scientists better understand how the deep mantle behaves
