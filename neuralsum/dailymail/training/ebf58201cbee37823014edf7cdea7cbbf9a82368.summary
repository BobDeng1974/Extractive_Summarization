as the sun beams down and the bees buzz in the bushes , @entity0 is happiest toddling around in her back garden just like any other curious two - year - old			1
but she is banned from enjoying this simple pleasure , because of a rare form of epilepsy that means she can suffer up to 16 seizures a day			1
if she has a fit at the wrong moment , she is at risk of serious injury			0
these pictures show her with two black eyes she suffered after collapsing at her brother 's birthday party			1
risk : @entity0 , two , is one of only a handful of children in @entity22 who suffer from @entity24 syndrome banned from playing outside : the disorder means that she is at risk of collapsing in a seizure at any moment danger : @entity0 's suffered the facial injuries pictured after she had a seizure at her brother 's birthday party summer is one of only a handful of people in @entity22 to suffer from @entity38 - an extreme form of epilepsy - and can collapse at any time , suffering fits that last up to four hours			1
after one particularly bad seizure she even suffered a stroke			0
now , after @entity0 hurt herself too many times , her terrified mother @entity44 , 25 , feels she needs to ban her daughter from playing outside			1
ms @entity0 , from @entity47 , @entity48 , said : ' obviously i 'm terrified she will hurt herself is she falls on the ground			2
' we had a birthday part for her little brother , @entity53 , a couple of weeks ago , and she suddenly dropped and had a seizure			2
she had a huge bump on her head , and two black eyes , as well as cuts all over her face			1
' it 's just too dangerous to let her play outside now			1
' we 're trying to install a soft play area in our back garden for summer to play in , but until it 's finished , i do n't dare let her play outside			2
' her big brother and sister , @entity65 , six , and @entity66 , four , are very caring though , and make sure they play inside with her , even though they 'd probably prefer to be outside in the sunshine			0
' ' i 'm terrified ' : @entity72 with ( from left ) @entity66 , four , @entity74 , two , @entity0 , two and @entity65 , six @entity0 first suffered a seizure when she was six months old			1
ms @entity0 told how she found her baby daughter fitting in her cot			0
she called an ambulance , which rushed @entity0 to hospital - where doctors tried to discover what had caused the hour - and - a - half long fit			1
it was six months before @entity0 was finally diagnosed with @entity85 syndrome			2
first described by @entity88 physician dr @entity24 in 1978 , it is a disorder beginning in infancy , that is characterised by intractable seizures			0
it is believed that one in every 20,000 to 40,000 children born are infected by @entity24 's , but symptoms vary from one child to another and incidence may be found to be greater as it becomes better recognised			1
there is no cure and it is more difficult to manage than other kinds of epilepsy			0
constant care and supervision of sufferers can be emotionally draining on family , says the @entity107			0
summer in hospital : she first suffered a seizure when she was just six months old in the past year , @entity0 's seizures have become longer and more frequent			2
ms @entity0 said : ' at first , she was only having one seizure every couple of weeks , but before long , it had become one every day			0
' then they became more frequent , and she now has up to 16 a day			0
' sometimes they 're only a couple of minutes long , sometimes they can last for four hours			0
' in march this year , @entity0 's seizures even triggered a stroke which stopped her form walking , an ability she was only able to relearn after extensive physiotherapy			1
' she still lacks some movement in her left arm , but hopefully in time , she will fully recover , ' said ms @entity0			2
' doctors say they do n't know whether her epilepsy will ever improve , but i just want to make sure my little girl can live as normal a life as possible			0
' i 'm so proud of how she copes with a very difficult condition - she 's always got a smile on her face			0
