by @entity0 with their sky - high prices , uni-formed doormen and super-chic staff , it ’s not surprising that i had never plucked up the courage to set my decidedly non-designer - shod foot in a designer fashion store			1
on behalf of ordinary women everywhere , i decided it was time to steel myself and visit some of our poshest shops , to discover just how high - end brands treat a @entity18 size 12 - 14 like me			1
armed with some questions that should suggest i ’m not quite as well - heeled as their usual customer , i set off to measure my reception on a scale from friendly to frosty			1
the list was simple : do they stock a size 16 ? what is their cheapest item ? and do they , ahem , offer discounts ? just for fun , i threw in a few extra requests : would they take a photo of me wearing one of their outfits ? could i use their loo ? and where is the nearest @entity43 store ? the results were hilarious , surprising and rather illuminating in equal measure ... scroll down or video @entity0 could fit into a size 12 at @entity48 @entity0 said that the staff at @entity50 were ' snooty and unhelpful ' @entity48 the @entity52 brand chosen to make @entity54 ’s beautiful wedding dress , @entity48 is known for its high - end and edgy street fashion			1
their shop is smaller than the others and decked out in neutral shades , and the staff are smiley and chatty			2
one assistant tells me that , sadly , 14 is their biggest size , but reassures me by saying : ‘ do n’t worry , we cut much more generously than the @entity64 labels			1
’ i ask to try on a £ 620 red wool dress and am shown to a small but luxurious changing room with thick pile carpets			1
the assistant tells me that i will absolutely fit into a size 12 , and she ’s right			1
she even brings me some gorgeous black stilettos to try on with the dress			2
while taking my photo , she even tells me how to pose			2
the dress looks amazing and i ’m tempted to splurge , but it ’s only £ 100 less than my monthly mortgage			2
their cheapest items are t - shirts or leggings for £ 395 each , which i ’m assured are ‘ amazing quality ’			2
i ’m politely refused a discount ( ‘ gosh , no , i really wish i could ’ ) , but they ’re happy for me to use the staff loo			2
and , after directing me to the nearest @entity43 , she tells me not to go at lunchtime when ‘ it ’s murder ’			1
@entity89 : 0 @entity50 @entity50 staff are famed on online forums for being snooty and unhelpful , and i understand why as soon as i walk through the door when a male assistant looks at me as though i ’ve just trodden in dog mess			1
inside , everyone is fussing around a group of @entity98 customers who appear to be buying by the rail			0
i , meanwhile , am ignored			0
while the website claims clothes come in sizes small , medium and large , the small looks as though it might fit a @entity105 doll , medium a @entity105 that ’s let herself go , and there are no large sizes on display at all			0
no wonder the unfriendly male assistant looks aghast when i ask for a 16			2
their biggest size , he says , is a 12 - 14 and even that , apparently , comes up small			1
when i say nothing will probably fit me , he agrees bluntly : ‘ no , probably not			0
’ nevertheless , i ask to try on a £ 1,900 cream raincoat that ’s far too tight for me			0
he refuses to take my photo in the article ( ‘ we do n’t allow photography ’ , so my picture here is taken outside the shop ) or give me a discount , and my request to use the lavatory is declined as , apparently , it ’s mysteriously ‘ not available at this time ’			0
i do n’t hold out much hope when i ask for the nearest @entity43 and , sure enough , the sales assistant has ‘ absolutely no idea ’ , even though we ’re only a five - minute stroll from one of the @entity52 ’s biggest branches			1
@entity89 : 10 the cheapest item in @entity138 was a £ 290 plain white top @entity0 was ignored by the staff in @entity141 @entity138 known for its chic , classic styles , @entity64 designer store @entity138 is decked out in black with soft lighting and stripped floorboards			1
a young male assistant tells me size 12 is their largest and ‘ that ’s probably more like a ten ’			1
when i ask what the size 16 people are supposed to wear , he just shrugs and says : ‘ they do n’t tend to come in , to be honest			1
’ you do n’t say			0
i ask to try a £ 1,960 jacket in a size 12 that i am a good two inches away from being able to button up			1
unbelievably , the assistant pushes the sale , saying : ‘ i do n’t think this is a style that necessarily needs to fasten			0
’ he may not , but for two grand i expect my clothes to fit			0
not even the cheapest item in the shop — a £ 290 plain white cotton top — looks as if it would do the honours			0
as he takes a photo , i hint that a reduction might persuade me to buy , but he says it ’s company policy not to offer discounts			0
though i ’m escorted to the staff loo — behind a scruffy stockroom piled high with boxes of shoes and handbags — i suspect this is more about making sure i do n’t pinch anything than making it easy for me			2
when i ask about @entity43 , i swear he shakes his head in a ‘ well , if that ’s where you usually shop , what the hell are you doing in here ? ’ kind of way			1
but , to his credit , he does give me directions			0
@entity89 : 5 @entity141 even though there are few customers , i ’m ignored by the staff in this huge @entity197 store			0
the rails are heaving with the sort of bejewelled dresses that i can only imagine @entity201 wearing , and the cheapest item is an ordinary - looking striped t - shirt for £ 530			2
there ’s no size 16			1
in fact , i ’m told abruptly the biggest size is a 12 , because ‘ our customers are very petite ’			1
to make matters worse , when i ask for anything that will fit me , i ’m told : ‘ we ’ve got stretchy dresses ; one of those might			0
’ i try on one costing £ 1,130 in a small changing room that is a bit dirty			0
there ’s a tissue on the floor and the mirror is smeared with hand prints			0
i ’m not offered champagne			0
worse , the dress strains across my bust — posh designers really seem to have it in for women with breasts			2
as the sales girl takes a photo , i tell her there ’s a mark on the dress and ask for a discount			2
she tells me she ’ll fetch another , but when i say i ’d prefer money off , she ’s perplexed : ‘ why would you want a dirty dress when you can have a clean one ? ’ they let me use their loo , which is in the basement , but by the time i start quizzing them about @entity43 , it ’s obvious i ’m not buying			1
the sales assistant claims ignorance before rushing off to serve someone else			0
@entity89 : 7 @entity247 stock both a size 16 and a size 18 dress size the staff at @entity252 were all keen to tell @entity0 how great she looked @entity247 @entity253 famously said a woman can never be too thin or too rich			1
i can safely say i ’m the only person in this shop who is neither			0
i head up a huge , sweeping marble staircase , where i ’m met by a friendly sales assistant who tells me they do , indeed , stock size 16 , as well as 18			1
most of the items do n’t carry price tags and i sense the typical customer does n’t ask how much things cost			0
even the staff are n’t sure what their cheapest item is , but think it might be a shirt for £ 600			0
asking to try on a metallic leather skirt for £ 1,140 , i ’m directed to a huge changing room — bigger than my living room — decorated with modern art , and offered a glass of champagne on a silver tray			0
i ’m delighted when i just about get a size 12 buttoned up and the assistant is more than happy to take a snap on my phone			1
there ’s no joy on my request for a discount , but they show me to the lovely customer toilets			0
as for @entity43 , the assistant has n’t a clue and asks a colleague who , in turn , asks another			1
i wonder if this is the first time the word ‘ @entity43 ’ has been uttered on the floor of @entity247			1
@entity89 : 4 @entity252 peering through the glass , i see staff who look as though they should be modelling the designer clothes rather than selling them			1
as with every store i have visited , only the smallest sizes are on display , the bigger ones in purdah out the back			0
the friendly @entity197 assistant informs me that 14 is their biggest size , but she thinks they will introduce size 16 soon ‘ because people keep asking ’			1
the cheapest thing i can buy is a t - shirt for £ 295			2
i ask to try on an over-the - top shiny pink suit			2
i ’m offered a refreshment and as it ’s early i forgo the champers on offer for orange juice , which is brought on a wooden tray along with a single flower in a vase			0
the £ 815 size 12 trousers fit around the waist but are about a foot too long			1
the only £ 1,440 jacket they have is a size ten , and it ’s far too tight			2
i rather like a terracotta silk shirt but at £ 410 it ’s out of my price range			0
the whole ensemble makes me look like a reject from @entity330 , but the staff all gather to tell me how fantastic i look			0
when i ask about a discount , the assistant says : ‘ if you bought the entire outfit i could probably get you something off			0
’ no chance ! there ’s a customer toilet and everyone is happy to direct me to @entity43			1

@entity0 has a real - woman body shape and is a high street 12 - 14 dress size
she asked questions *including* ' do they stock a size 16 ? ' and even ' where *'s* the nearest @entity43 ? '
@entity252 and @entity48 were the friendliest
@entity50 and @entity247 were the most frosty
