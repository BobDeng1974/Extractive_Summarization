i have done my best to avoid talking about my 20 - year relationship with @entity2 for almost two decades			1
but now , due to the many stories flying around , most of which seem to favour his troubled wife @entity6 , i want to protect his truth as i know it			1
i first met @entity2 on the set of the 1962 film @entity10 but i ’d fallen in love with him years before that when he played @entity14 in @entity15			1
i was just 11 and dreamed about him until , at 18 , i was starring opposite him			2
we had to go to @entity17 to shoot on location – and there all my dreams were finally consummated			2
it was the beginning of an on / off love affair which would last 20 years , outside of my two marriages to @entity23			1
price of fame : @entity2 admitted to accidentally pushing his then - wife @entity6 into a fire place in 1963 he asked me to join his new @entity28 to play @entity29 in @entity31 ’s @entity30 , which he was directing			1
in a break in rehearsals one morning , he noticed how exhausted i looked and asked me what was wrong			2
i told him about my @entity36 saga			2
@entity36 was a fellow @entity37 student who had looked me up , and finding that i now lived in a house in @entity39 , barged through my front door with her suitcase one afternoon and asked if she could stay with me until she got her bearings			2
she apparently had no family – and stayed for three years			1
when i told @entity44 that she had been diagnosed as a manic depressive , schizophrenic nymphomaniac – it was n’t unusual to find three men queuing on the steps of my home waiting to ‘ entertain ’ @entity36 – his eyes popped open in astonishment			1
‘ a manic depressive , schizophrenic , nymphomaniac , eh			2
. ? ’ he repeated quietly			2
‘ well , well , what a coincidence			2
’ he went on to tell me that @entity6 had been diagnosed with exactly the same three conditions			1
first meeting : @entity56 and @entity2 in @entity10 in 1962 , where they embarked on a 20 year on / off relationship over the next 25 years , @entity44 would share many @entity6 stories , sometimes portraying her in a very disturbing , cruel light			1
he , too , did not always emerge smelling of roses			2
for example , he told how once , before he and @entity6 parted for good , he pushed her aside during a row and she accidentally tripped and fell into the fireplace , hitting her head on the fire dog			1
@entity44 thought he had killed her			1
when @entity6 came round , he swore that if he did n’t part from her , next time he surely would kill her			1
the more we compared notes , the closer we became , for we both shared the utter despair , the unimaginable frustration and hopelessness of wrestling with two such pitiable creatures , albeit not at the same time			1
but because i was still going through my @entity36 era , @entity44 often gave me invaluable advice			1
@entity36 attempted suicide three times by swallowing sleeping pills			2
on two occasions i just managed to get her to hospital in the nick of time			2
but the third time , seeing her lying there like @entity87 , her mane of almost pale green hair flowing over the white pillow , i whispered in her ear : ‘ @entity36 , jump if you really want to die			2
’ a few months later she did			2
@entity44 admitted that the period after splitting up with @entity6 was the darkest , most lonely time of his whole life			1
indeed , if it was n’t for the fact that @entity6 was always threatening to kill herself while they were together , he might have taken his own life , for he was seriously off balance at that time			1
@entity44 was too much of a gentleman to speak openly about @entity6 ’s sex addiction			1
but i do know that @entity6 would get her kicks by making sure she would time her ‘ amours ’ to coincide with @entity44 returning to their house in @entity39 or @entity108 , their country estate in @entity110			1
jealousy was rife between the pair , but @entity6 became unmanageable when @entity44 began having hit after hit			1
she wanted to be @entity44			1
she demanded that he use his influence to create opportunities for her to become a @entity116 , and felt that @entity44 was n’t helping her sufficiently to that end			1
but he told me : ‘ the truth is she was n’t good enough in the theatre			2
she would never even bother turning up for her voice production classes			2
‘ now , if she had stuck to filming , she would have won @entity121 after @entity121 , but that was n’t good enough for @entity6 – she was determined to beat me at my own game			1
’ i worked with @entity6 in 1959 , long before i met @entity2			1
diva : @entity6 , as @entity125 in gone with the wind , demanded that @entity56 was not allowed to wear any colour but black when they worked together when i was 16 and still at @entity37 , my agent @entity129 – the patriarch of the @entity131 acting dynasty – suggested i get my first experience of a film studio and he secured a walk - on part for me in @entity135 , starring @entity6 and @entity136			1
it was daunting , scary even , walking through the gates of @entity139 at 5am and asking the porter at the front desk for my dressing room key , precisely as @entity129 had instructed			2
i was somewhat puzzled to discover that although the number on the door matched that on my key , the name on the door read @entity149 – who back then was a musical legend			0
had there been some mistake ? i checked my key number yet again			0
it was correct so , full of confidence , i placed the key in the lock , only to receive three sharp taps on my shoulder as i did so			0
‘ you ca n’t go in there , that ’s @entity149 ’s dressing room ! ’ hissed a small lady behind me , her dazzling eyes hot with confrontation			0
‘ good morning , miss @entity6 , ’ i replied as sweetly as i could muster			1
‘ that ’s @entity149 ’s dressing room , ’ she repeated , eyes hotter than ever			0
‘ the porter has obviously given you the wrong key , you should n’t be up here			0
walk - ons are downstairs in the extras ’ dressing rooms			0
’ her sharp tongue and dazzling eyes were beginning to have an effect on me			0
i was only 16 , after all , so what right had the great lady to terrorise me in this way ? ‘ now off you trot this instant , and check your key number with the porter , ’ she demanded			0
i showed her my key			0
‘ look , the numbers match , but by all means , you check with the porter if you wish , ’ i suggested , opening the door and walking in			0
@entity192 ’s dressing table was full of her private , personal paraphernalia			0
maybe @entity6 had a point , maybe there had been a mistake			1
still , i trusted @entity129 , my wizard of an agent ; he probably represented @entity149 too , and had arranged it all beforehand			0
i sat down as @entity129 had instructed to await the arrival of the costume designer , @entity201 who was to dress me			0
@entity201 was @entity6 ’s best friend at that time			1
suddenly miss @entity6 flounced in , stuffing a sheet of paper into my hand			1
‘ that ’s a list of colours you ca n’t wear , ’ she announced before flouncing out again			0
every colour was on that list except black			0
rising star : @entity56 in 1965 , three years into her relationship with @entity2 @entity201 turned away from me after reading @entity6 ’s long list			1
‘ bitch , ’ she mumbled under her breath , thinking i had n’t heard			0
‘ we ’ll show her			0
’ indeed , she did			0
for my walk - on role , @entity201 dressed me in an overwhelmingly soft , sumptuously sexy black leather suit , well ahead of its time			2
the moment i appeared on the set @entity221 did a double - take , which @entity6 caught			1
he then picked up a copy of @entity223 , placed it in front of his face , walked over the stage floor and made a beeline for me			0
he stood there , directly in front of me , pointing to his face in close - up on the magazine ’s cover			0
suddenly he whipped it away , revealing his real face			0
‘ hi , my name ’s @entity136 , ’ he said			0
he gave a slight bow before returning to his chair and glancing toward @entity6 as he went			1
from then on , i felt distinctly uncomfortable , with @entity6 ’s vixen eyes glued to either @entity221 or me all day			1
it was obvious to me that they were having an affair			0
if only i could have pacified @entity6 by telling her that @entity221 ’s advances meant nothing to me – he was n’t my type at all – the day might have turned out quite , quite differently			1
but i found @entity6 to be a distinctly brittle , dark and jealous woman			1
since it was my first day in the movie world , i presumed that this egomaniacal behaviour must be the norm			0
as fate would have it , a few years later i was invited to a tea party at the home of the actor @entity253 in @entity254			2
i recall it being a beautiful afternoon , and the garden was packed with showbiz types			0
about halfway through the afternoon , a lady dressed in black wafted across the lawn			0
her escort led her to a chair in the shade under a tree			0
i bided my time and then i went over with a plate of cakes and offered her one			2
she looked at me in a puzzled manner			0
‘ have we met before ? ’ she asked in a somewhat tired voice			0
‘ yes , on @entity135 , ’ i replied			0
‘ you told me i could only wear black			0
, ’ she replied , and remembering , she sort of shrugged an embarrassed apology			0
our eyes were drawn to her outfit			0
‘ @entity278 suits you , ’ i told her truthfully			0
i ’ll never forget the inconsolable fragility within her smile , the ravishing beauty now ravaged by life			0
whatever the truth about the relationship between @entity2 and @entity6 – and the truth , being such a pliable substance , is always in the middle somewhere – one thing is for sure : when @entity44 and @entity289 split up most of the chattering classes sided with her			1
@entity56 , whose screen credits include @entity292 , @entity293 and @entity294 , has turned her @entity296 manor house into a retreat for healing and meditation			1
