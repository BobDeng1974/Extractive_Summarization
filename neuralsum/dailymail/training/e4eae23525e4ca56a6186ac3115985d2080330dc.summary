@entity0 has slammed sir @entity1 for calling @entity2 ‘ useless ’ during the @entity3 and claimed he has lost the respect of @entity6 ’s top golfers			1
@entity0 revealed the home locker room was fuming about the remark and said @entity1 had gone from being his hero to zero			1
he accused him of sour grapes and being embittered because he is the only losing @entity6 @entity3 captain this century			1
the colourful @entity12 made his strong remarks in his autobiography ‘ @entity15 , ’ released this week			2
' guys are trying to get themselves heard on tv – that ’s what it is			2
it ’s somebody thinking , i am going to go to a golf tournament today and i ’m going to shout ‘ me nan wears pants ’			2
it ’s really not very clever			2
' @entity0 is highly critical of @entity38 crowds after @entity6 ’s @entity3 victory at @entity40			1
he says : ' i ’m all for atmosphere in golf and the crowd getting involved , but there ’s a line to be tread and occasionally things are said too early			2
' he describes someone yelling ' get in the hole ' on a 500 - yard par five as ' very stupid '			2
he suggests : ' hit the fairway ' would be more helpful but the bray ' @entity50 ' has no relevance			0
the most mystifying unrelated golf shout is ' mashed potato '			0
@entity0 warns : ' if you are concentrating on a shot and someone screams on your backswing , it is off - putting			1
it has the potential to affect the outcome of a match or tournament			0
' @entity1 , in his capacity as an @entity38 television commentator , was asked during the first day of the @entity3 about @entity2 and referred back to his own time as captain in 2008 , saying the @entity70 had had a ‘ bad attitude ’ and had been ‘ useless ’			1
@entity1 claimed later the remark was in ‘ semi-jest ’ before conceding that ‘ useless ’ had been a poor choice of word			1
‘ “ @entity75 ” would have been better , ’ he added			0
@entity2 was ill at @entity76 in 2008 and also love - sick after splitting from his long - term girlfriend , @entity79 ’s daughter @entity78			1
in his book , @entity0 takes up the story at @entity82 from the players ’ perspective			1
they are buzzing after a brilliant fightback in the afternoon foursomes to take a 5 - 3 first day lead			0
‘ there is only one negative , ’ writes @entity0			1
‘ at the press conference , it emerges @entity1 has been heavily critical of @entity2			1
he has said @entity2 had a bad attitude when he played under @entity1 in the @entity94 and that he was “ useless ” there			1
‘ @entity2 puts a brave face on it but the rest of the guys are fuming			1
i ’m shocked that he has said it			0
it ’s a cheap shot and it ’s the worst possible timing			0
‘ it makes me laugh			0
@entity1 is talking about someone being useless at the @entity94			1
that ’s the @entity3 where he was captain			1
that ’s the @entity3 where the @entity6 team suffered a heavy defeat			1
sir @entity1 angered many of @entity6 's top golfers by calling @entity2 ‘ useless ’ during the @entity3 ‘ and he was captain			1
so who ’s useless ? @entity1 might need to have a little look in the mirror			1
i have always got on great with @entity1 in the past and i have a great deal of respect for everything he has achieved but this feels like sour grapes			1
it feels like a guy who is still bitter that he lost in 2008			1
‘ @entity1 has lost a lot of respect from players because of what he said			1
there were plenty of things a lot of the players were unhappy with at @entity76 but none of us criticised him			2
he may find that begins to change now			0
’ @entity1 is not the only captain who comes under fire			2
some of @entity38 skipper @entity133 ’s strange decisions come under scrutiny			0
‘ by the end of the second day we have a 10 - 6 lead , ’ says @entity0			2
‘ ecstatic as we are , quite a few of us are surprised by @entity133 ’s decision - making during saturday ’s play			0
most of all i ’m astonished he does not play @entity142 and @entity143			0
@entity2 was love - sick after splitting from long - term girlfriend , @entity79 ’s daughter @entity78 in 2008 ‘ he leaves them out of both sessions			1
it gives us a double boost because it tells us there are problems in the @entity38 team room			0
‘ @entity133 ’s choices mean seven of his players play 36 holes on saturday			0
i find it hard to see the sense in that			0
some of them look shattered and @entity163 ’s strategy starts to pay off			0
we keep coming at them			0
wave after wave after wave			0
’ @entity0 talks about partnering home hero @entity166 against @entity167 and @entity168 on the opening morning and admits he was not cut out for the role of big brother			2
‘ i find it hard taking on the responsibility of helping a rookie , ’ he says			0
‘ i ’m nervous , too			0
i want to win for him as much as myself and the team but we get humped 5 & 4			0
’ @entity0 played the following morning alongside @entity16			2
at the 15th hole , the @entity3 finally gets its first taste of that old @entity0 magic as he chips in for a birdie to win the hole and help secure a half against @entity183 and @entity184			1
he admits he was disappointed not to partner his old mate @entity185 in the afternoon foursomes			0
‘ @entity163 has decided to go with @entity187 ( @entity188 ) and tells me if i had made that chip shot 15 minutes earlier i ’d have been playing , ’ he says			0
