by @entity0 published : 11:48 est , 2 january 2014 updated : 12:23 est , 2 january 2014 over half a million guns are stolen in the @entity3 every year and anecdotal evidence suggests that a lot of killings are the result of people using stolen weapons or guns borrowed from family members			1
now researchers are looking into ways to add radio frequency identification ( @entity16 ) chips into guns so that they can only shoot when they are fired by their owner			1
while there are no immediate plans to introduce the technology , one expert believes it could prevent unnecessary loss of life			0
@entity16 chips could be used in guns to clamp down on the use of weapons by anyone other than their owners , who would need an accompanying rfid chip fitted to fire the weapon radio - frequency identification ( @entity16 ) is the wireless non-contact use of radio - frequency electromagnetic fields to transfer data , for the purposes of automatically identifying and tracking tags attached to objects			1
@entity16 tags are used to track animals and are inserted beneath their skin			2
the anti-theft hard plastic tags attached to merchandise in stores use the technology			0
@entity16 tags are used to check baggage in airports and identify trees			0
they are embedded in credit cards and @entity54 transport cards so users can make payments by touching an electronic reader			0
the idea of using @entity16 chips in guns is not new and is a relatively cheap way of clamping down on the use of guns by anyone other than their owners			1
the person firing the gun would need an accompanying @entity16 chip fitted inside their hand or carried on their person to fire a weapon fitted with a linked @entity16 tag			1
@entity73 , a semiconductor industry analyst said an rfid tag can be surgically implanted into a person ’s hand to override a lock on the gun			0
writing in a @entity80 blog , he said he first came across the idea in 2005 but while the tags are small and relatively unnoticeable once implanted , they will eventually become obsolete and can move around the body , meaning a person firing a gun might have to hold it in a particular way			0
a semiconductor industry analyst said an rfid tag ( pictured ) could be surgically implanted into a person 's hand or embedded in a ring or bracelet to override a lock on a smart gun some guns have biometric sensors to read an individual 's fingerprint or grip , but the technology takes a few seconds to verify an individual however , the chip could additionally be embedded into a ring or bracelet , known as a key			1
while not as secure as an implant , this would still make the firing of a stolen weapon much more difficult if the key is n't in very close proximity			2
according to mr @entity73 , @entity16 chips cost less than ten cents ( six pence ) each and the electronics used in the reader costs less than a dollar or 61 pence			2
mr @entity73 believes the @entity16 approach is superior to adding biometric sensors to guns as that technology takes a few seconds to verify a fingerprint or grip , leading gun owners to argue that delay could cost them their lives			1
he pointed out that it is not rare for a killer to murder a police officer with another officer ’s gun , or for school children to steal a parent ’s weapon , while stolen firearms are often used in gang violence			2
a @entity3 @entity139 survey found 37 per cent of prison inmates used a family member ’s gun and 40 per cent got their gun from an illegal source and mr @entity73 thinks that @entity16 technology could reduce the number of guns stolen or borrowed			1
the state of @entity149 passed a law in 2002 that requires gun shops to only sell smart guns within three years of them becoming available			0
however , some gun owners worry that the technology could be tampered with by anti-gun outsiders and affect their ability to bear arms , while others worry it could undermine the reliability of their weapon			2
a gun fitted with biometric sensors is used in the latest @entity167 film , @entity168 , where one of @entity167 's rivals tries to use the @entity173 secret agent 's gun , but fails			0
some people who are not in favour of the technology being used for weapons argue the time it takes to identify their fingerprint could cost them their lives			0

*scientists* are researching using radio frequency identification ( @entity16 ) chips in guns to prevent people firing stolen or borrowed weapons
gun owners would need an accompanying @entity16 chip fitted inside their hand or embedded in a ring or bracelet to fire their own weapon
