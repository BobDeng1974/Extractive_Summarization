by @entity0 published : 19:05 est , 10 february 2013 updated : 03:12 est , 11 february 2013 in today ’s era , we worry about our digital and environmental footprints , but what of the genetic traces we leave behind ? one @entity7 - based artist has pondered such information , and rendered @entity9 of anonymous @entity11 ’s faces by using only their dna collected from everyday discarded items such as gum , cigarette butts , and fallen strands of hair			1
information artist @entity18 said that these renderings bear only a ‘ family resemblance ’ to their original owners , as it would be near - impossible to exactly replicate someone ’s looks			1
here 's looking at you , kid : information artists @entity18 collected objects from the streets of @entity7 and created generalized 3d portraits using only their dna ; this cigarette was retrieved from the intersection of @entity34 and @entity7 ; its smoker is an eastern @entity37 female in her project , entitled ‘ @entity40 , ’ ms @entity38 was initially intrigued by what information people leave behind			1
the original idea came to her during a therapy session			2
' i noticed there was a crack in the picture and there was a hair in the crack			2
i became really curious about it , ' she told @entity56 on sunday evening			2
' and seeped in the popular culture of forensics , i really wondered what was actually possible			2
' from a single strand of hair , she can extract basic hereditary traits , including hair color , eye color , ethnicity , and gender			2
however , her 3d renderings were based only on eye color , gender , and maternal ethnicity			1
' age is n’t one of the factors i ’m using , ' the 30 - year - old @entity73 resident said			0
' it is information that is becoming increasingly available			1
right now , ( the renderings ) are in the 20 - something range			0
but they could be eight or 80			0
' she analyzed the samples and rendered them in a program she wrote herself , and printed out the end result using a 3d printer			1
the artist told @entity88 that a lot of the actual rendering had a lot of guesswork to it			1
dominant genes , such as brown hair and brown eyes , are hard to predict			0
‘ there ’s an 80 percent chance that this person has brown eyes and 20 percent chance they have green eyes , ’ she told the website			0
traces : another subject left a cigarette behind on @entity34 ; the artist discovered that he , too , was of eastern @entity37 descent and had brown hair and eyes found objects : the cigarette was recovered from a fairly dingy area of @entity34 in @entity7 ‘ you have to make that call			1
’ ms @entity38 added that the rendering called for a bit of , well , artistic licence			0
‘ it does involve , essentially , creating a stereotype and generating faces based on those stereotyped ideas , ’ she told @entity88 , adding that she ’s hoping to tackle additional traits			0
she writes on her blog that many of the samples were taken from unassuming locations			0
' like any kind of science , as the technology becomes implemented , there is the potential for great help and the potential for great harm			0
' a cigarette butt from @entity139 in @entity7 carried the dna of an eastern @entity37 male , who was found to have brown eyes			1
at the intersection of @entity144 and @entity145 , ms @entity38 found a discarded piece of used gum			1
the dna was @entity149 , meaning the chewer was of @entity152 and @entity153 backgrounds			1
' my original goal in starting this project was to understand more about forensic and dna technology , ' she told @entity56			2
' i ’m thinking about the issues more , and i hope it can open up a dialogue both in terms of how it can be used in law enforcement and the opportunities we have to survey each other			0
we do n’t have a lot of legislation , and we need a dialogue on it			0
' like any kind of science , as the technology becomes implemented , there is the potential for great help and the potential for great harm			0
' ms @entity38 's renderings are currently on display at the @entity182 in @entity183			0
pieces of me : a @entity11 's discarded gum led to this 3d rendering of a man @entity187 found to be of @entity188 and @entity153 decent corner store : the gum was recovered in front of this bodega at the corner of @entity144 and @entity145			1

information artist @entity18 *reconstructs* 3d images of *strangers* using only their dna from discarded objects
@entity200 finished products bear only ' family resemblance ' to actual owner of the dna
