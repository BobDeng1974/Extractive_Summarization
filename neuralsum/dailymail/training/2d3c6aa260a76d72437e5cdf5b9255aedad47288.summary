by @entity0 published : 13:40 est , 8 january 2013 updated : 14:13 est , 8 january 2013 @entity3 's @entity2 is home to lakes of massive hydrocarbon ' icebergs ' that could form exotic forms of life , scientists have claimed			1
@entity10 researchers say the new theory may also explain bizarre reading from the vast lakes and seas on the moon			0
' one of the most intriguing questions about these lakes and seas is whether they might host an exotic form of life , ' said @entity22 of @entity23 , who co-authored the study			0
an artist 's impression of the hydrocarbon ' icebergs ' on @entity2 scientists believe could harbour an exotic form of life @entity2 is the only other body besides @entity33 in our solar system with stable bodies of liquid on its surface			2
however , while our planet 's cycle of precipitation and evaporation involves water , @entity2 's cycle involves hydrocarbons like ethane and methane			2
ethane and methane are organic molecules , which scientists think can be building blocks for the more complex chemistry from which life arose			0
@entity53 has seen a vast network of these hydrocarbon seas cover @entity2 's northern hemisphere , while a more sporadic set of lakes bejewels the southern hemisphere			1
@entity53 scientists assumed that @entity2 lakes would not have floating ice , because solid methane is denser than liquid methane and would sink			0
@entity2 in front of @entity3 : researchers now believe the moon could hold ' exotic life ' in its lakes and rivers but the new model , revealed today , considers the interaction between the lakes and the atmosphere , resulting in different mixtures of compositions , pockets of nitrogen gas , and changes in temperature			1
the result , scientists found , is that winter ice will float in @entity2 's methane - and - ethane - rich lakes and seas if the temperature is below the freezing point of methane -- minus 297 degrees @entity89 ( 90.4 @entity90 )			1
' we now know it 's possible to get methane - and - ethane - rich ice freezing over on @entity2 in thin blocks that congeal together as it gets colder -- similar to what we see with @entity99 sea ice at the onset of winter , ' said @entity101 , first author on the paper and a @entity104 scholar at @entity23			2
' we 'll want to take these conditions into consideration if we ever decide to explore the @entity2 surface some day			0

researchers believe the lakes and seas could contain life **due** to their unique chemistry
believe ice could be *colourless* , but appear reddish - *brown* **due** to @entity2 's atmosphere
