by @entity0 published : 03:39 est , 2 august 2013 updated : 06:28 est , 2 august 2013 @entity1 @entity1 is living up to her nickname by this year taking on a number of fitness challenges			1
she 's already competed in the five mile @entity5 and the @entity6 and now she 's preparing for her biggest endurance feat yet - the @entity8			1
the singer , 39 , will take part in the half marathon in october with a team of runners raising money for the charity shelter			1
as well as completing the gruelling 13.1 mile distance , their challenge will be to beat former gb 400m athlete @entity19 , who will be raising money with his team for @entity22 at the @entity23 in october			1
@entity1 : so far this year @entity1 has competed in the five mile @entity5 , left , and the @entity6 as october 's @entity23 in @entity25 is a shorter distance than the @entity28 half marathon at 10 miles , the competition is based on which team raises the most money and not on who runs the fastest			1
but that has n't stopped the pair getting competitive			1
' @entity1 is pretty fit at the moment but i think i could beat her over a half marathon , ' @entity19 , 39 , told @entity38			1
' i guess i have a bit of an edge being an ex-professional athlete as you always have that mental strength , so when it starts to hurt , you know how to push yourself through that pain barrier			1
' the race is on : @entity1 and @entity19 will compete to see whose team can raise the most money for charity @entity1 said she has been running three times as week as well as doing gym workouts , swims and bike rides			1
but she intends to step her running training up over the summer so she can complete the half marathon - with an aim of finishing in under two hours			1
she admitted she is slightly daunted by the distance : ' it will be the furthest i ’ve run in my whole life			1
i have been having lots of fun in the triathlon and enjoying the different disciplines of the swim , bike and run but i have never done long distances , ' she said			1
' i have always wanted to do a half marathon but i am putting myself in the deep end with the @entity8 as it ’s the biggest half in the world , everyone knows about it and it ’s not an easy course , it ’s quite undulating			1
@entity19 ’s told me it ’s really hard but i ’m not sure if he ’s just psyching me out ! ' @entity1 said she is enjoying the running training as it gives her some ' me ' time as she juggles her singing career - she has a single out with @entity83 and will go on tour again later this year with @entity85 - alongside being a parent to daughter , @entity87 , four			1
catch me if you can : @entity1 has been training hard and hopes to finish the half marathon in under two hours she said : ' it can be tricky and that ’s what stops me training as much as i would like			1
my daughter is my priority but i have when she is at school to train			2
' like everyone i just have to try and fit it in			2
i ’m lucky in the respect that i do n’t have a 9 to 5 job so sometimes i will have a morning or afternoon free			2
' @entity1 , who has been open about her battle with eating disorders in the past , said she now prefers to stay in shape by exercising and eating healthily			1
she said : ' when you are exercising you can be more relaxed about your diet			1
when you are in the public eye there is a lot of pressure to stay slim and look a certain way but if you are active and eating well then most of the time it takes care of itself			2
' i 'd say to young girls it ’s always better to exercise and eat healthily than diet			2
there are no quick fixes , diets really do n’t work			2
' there are times when i was younger when i have gone with the trends and tried different diets			0
i did a low carb one once but that made me feel awful because i am so active			0
' benefits : the singer said she loves running as it clears her head and keeps her physically healthy she admitted she is currently stocking up on carbs to get her through her half marathon training			2
' it ’s just a case of making sure you have enough fuel when you are demanding more of your body			0
so i am having more carbs for energy			0
i also have to make sure i eat regularly and never leave long gaps so i always have something in the tank , ' she said			0
she revealed she did try the @entity148 earlier this year - beloved by her fellow @entity150 @entity149 - but she ca n't sustain it long term			0
she said : ' i have done the @entity148 before we went on tour with @entity85			0
i ’m really into eating to benefit what you were doing and it was recommended to me so i tried it			0
i enjoyed it and it gave me a lot of energy			0
' it ’s basically vegetarian and involves taking acid out of your diet , so no meats or processed foods			2
it ’s the things we know anyway about not eating things that are bad for you and sticking to whole grains , soya and pulses			0
but it ’s hard to stick to when barbecue season hits as i do like a burger ! ' @entity1 added that her exercise regime means she can find it difficult to find clothes to fit her toned arms - ' but then i just get the guns out ! ' she joked			1
if the @entity8 goes well she said she would be tempted to do double the distance at next year 's @entity187			1
ompetitive : @entity19 and @entity1 are good friends as well as rivals it 's a race @entity19 knows well as he 's raced it numerous times with a pb time of 3 hours and 58 minutes			1
he said the transition from sprinter to long distance runner was n't easy			0
' every year i do the @entity187 and people overtaking me saying , " what are you doing , you should be faster than this ! " but it ’s completely different , ' he explained			0
' it ’s a different pain to what i was used to			0
racing over 400m you get lactic acid and have to dig deep and then you may feel sick for ten minutes afterwards if it was a hard race			2
but the marathon , the first year i did it i could n’t walk down the stairs until the thursday after ! it 's the toughest thing i have ever done			2
' @entity19 was also keen to set the record straight about a recent triathlon at @entity211 where it was reported he ' nearly drowned ' when he pulled out of the swim			0
' it 's the toughest thing i 've ever done ' : @entity19 said swapping 400m running for marathon training has n't been easy he said : ' i had n’t done a triathlon for a couple of years and i got in the water and had a bit of a panic attack			1
i was n't breathing properly so waved to the rescue boat to get a lift home			0
it was n't as bad as it was reported , i did n't nearly drown			0
' it has n’t put me off triathlons though , they are such great fun			0
i was furious with myself afterwards for not finishing			0
' @entity19 added that he 's delighted more people are getting into sport after the @entity232 and that @entity233 have been coming out top this year in everything from the @entity236 to @entity237			2
but he said he 's disappointed drugs scandals has been overshadowing clean performances in athletics			2
he said : ' when i heard about @entity241 and @entity242 i was really angry and disappointed for the sport			0
' it is a good thing we are catching the cheats out but the danger is people tarnish all athletes with the same brush			0
people might be put off the sport because they think the very best are on drugs but that ’s not the case			0
it ’s just a handful of idiots who see the benefits of being the best in the world and take short cuts to get there			0
