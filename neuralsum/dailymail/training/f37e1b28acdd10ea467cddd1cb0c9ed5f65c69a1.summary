out of sight : @entity1 pictured with his 2006 portrait of the @entity3 which has now disappeared there have been more than 130 official portraits of the @entity3 since she ascended the throne – many by artists as eminent as @entity9 and @entity10			1
all are incredibly valuable and highly sought after			0
but now one @entity13 portrait – which @entity3 posed for in person to mark her 80th birthday – appears to have mysteriously gone missing			1
the man who captured the @entity13 likeness was @entity18 entertainer @entity1 , now charged with a string of child sex offences			1
and in a bizarre game of pass - the - portrait played out by the @entity25 , the @entity26 and @entity28 ’s @entity27 , his 2006 picture of the @entity3 seems to have disappeared from the world of art. @entity1 ’s oil painting – commissioned by the @entity26 – took two months to paint			1
the @entity3 sat for it twice at @entity33 and it was unveiled for her by @entity1 in the @entity33 ’s @entity35			1
the artwork shows her majesty in a relaxed pose , smiling and wearing a green dress , the first of its kind to depict the monarch in such an informal pose			0
the @entity3 wears a three - stranded pearl necklace and a brooch made for her to mark her late mother ’s 100th birthday			1
@entity1 told reporters at the public unveiling that her majesty had described the painting as being ‘ very friendly ’ , although the work was not always well received at the time by art critics			2
his efforts were filmed by the @entity26 and shown in a special edition of his programme , @entity57 , as part of a series of 80th birthday celebratory documentaries			1
the portrait hung in the @entity62 , attached to the south - west wing of the @entity33 , until 2007 when it was loaned to the @entity27 in @entity28 for several years			0
the painting left the gallery in august last year			0
in november , @entity1 was first questioned by police involved in the @entity68 inquiry , set up following the @entity70 scandal , a process that has led to him being charged with nine counts of indecent assault and four of making indecent images of children			1
a spokesman for the @entity27 said : ‘ we had the painting on loan from @entity90 and the @entity91			0
' we then returned the piece and do not have any knowledge about what has happened to it since			0
’ mystery : the @entity33 says that the painting never actually belonged to the queen but the @entity99 claims that the portrait in fact never belonged to the @entity3 despite it being commissioned to celebrate her birthday			1
a spokesman for the @entity25 said : ‘ we do n’t have it			0
the portrait was not gifted to the @entity3 and was only ever given to us on loan so we could display it in the @entity62			2
' there was a great deal of public interest surrounding the @entity26 programme about the portrait and it was for this reason that we decided to display it in our gallery			2
' the portrait was , to our understanding , commissioned and dealt with by the @entity26			1
’ but a @entity26 insider said : ‘ we do n’t have it any more and we do n’t know where it is now			2
’ a spokesman for the @entity123 added : ‘ we never owned the artwork			0
if the piece is not with us or the @entity33 , it must be in mr @entity1 ’ personal collection			2
’ a spokesman for @entity1 refused to respond to several enquiries about the painting ’s whereabouts			2
and a spokesman at @entity131 – also in @entity28 – which owns the bulk of mr @entity1 ’s other artwork , declined to comment and hung up the phone when asked about the picture			0
an art world source said : ‘ @entity1 ’s art is a touchy subject			0
responsibility is being passed around like hot coals and no one seems to know where it is			0

the @entity18 entertainer painted the portrait for @entity3 's 80th birthday
@entity1 has since been charged with a string of child sex offences
the portrait , commissioned by the @entity26 , now seems to have vanished
