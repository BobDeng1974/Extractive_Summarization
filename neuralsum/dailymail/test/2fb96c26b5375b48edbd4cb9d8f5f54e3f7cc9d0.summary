@entity0 suffered a fresh blow today after a new poll showed @entity3 trailing badly in a series of key seats			1
across 10 constituencies targeted by mr @entity0 's party , @entity3 has fallen 18 points behind the @entity9 and seven behind @entity10			1
the revelation came as mr @entity0 admitted that he had ' made some mistakes ' during the campaign but insisted he was confident he could get it back on track			1
however , speaking to @entity28 tonight , mr @entity0 insisted he was looking forward to the rest of the campaign and had ' a bit of the old vim and vigour back '			1
he said : ' i started the campaign and think i make some mistakes			2
my desperation for @entity3 to do well meant that i really packed the diary and the day in a way that frankly was n't very bright			1
i have now trimmed it back a bit			2
i 'm being a bit more selective			2
' asked if he was ' exhausted ' he said : ' no , i 'm now actually rejuvenated and enjoying it again			2
' but told he had looked ' a bit wonky ' earlier in the campaign , mr @entity0 said : ' i was			2
no , no. hands up i was			0
i had completely overdone it			0
' i was n't getting it right			0
i feel a bit of the old vim and vigour back and i 'm looking forward to the next fortnight			2
' the @entity3 leader - appearing on @entity23 's @entity51 this morning - said he had ' made some mistakes ' by trying to do too much and had had to scale back his commitments mr @entity0 insisted he was looking forward to the rest of the campaign and had ' a bit of the old vim and vigour back ' the admission came as the deputy prime minister @entity58 accused mr @entity0 of being an ' odious @entity60 ' character			1
in an interview with @entity62 , mr @entity58 said mr @entity0 's ' mask is slipping ' to reveal a man uncomfortable talking about people who are not white ' lashing out ' in a scrabble for headlines			0
the @entity69 leader condemned @entity71 's appeal to @entity3 supporters to ' come home ' , warning the ' bandwagons of the far right ' are encircling an ' increasingly hapless conservative leadership ' which is losing all grip on the party			1

@entity58 told @entity62 that mr @entity0 was ' odious ' the @entity69 leader condemned @entity71 's appeal to @entity3 supporters to ' come home ' , warning the ' bandwagons of the far right ' are encircling an ' increasingly hapless conservative leadership ' which is losing all grip on the party			1
it came after mr @entity0 called for any migrants rescued from the @entity89 to be sent back to @entity90			2
the @entity3 leader said ' millions ' of refugees could arrive on boats in @entity94 over the next few years unless they are intercepted and turned back now			1
mr @entity0 urged prime minister @entity71 to resist pressure at an emergency summit of @entity98 leaders in @entity99 tomorrow for @entity100 to take in large numbers of refugees brought across the @entity89 by people - smugglers			0
he insisted the @entity100 could not take more than ' a few thousand ' genuine refugees			0
his comments came as experts warned that up to 30,000 migrants , including 2,500 children , could be killed this year unless the crisis is tackled			0
up to 950 people are believed to have drowned in a shipwreck off the coast of @entity113 on saturday , according to the @entity115 high commissioner for refugees			0
just 28 people are known to have survived the tragedy , described by @entity118 as ' the deadliest incident in the @entity89 we have ever recorded '			0
however , a major survey published today suggested mr @entity0 's hard - line immigration stance was popular with the public			2
barely one in ten electors say they are satisfied with conservative border policies over the past five years			0
the poll by @entity127 suggests this unhappiness may be the key factor behind large numbers of conservative voters switching to @entity3			1
@entity71 and @entity132 campaigned together in @entity133 with polls showing that the @entity9 are on course to hold on to a string of key marginals of those who supported @entity71 in 2010 , but now intend to vote for mr @entity0 's party , 94 per cent are dissatisfied with immigration policy			1
this compared to 45 per cent of voters sticking with the @entity9			1
this loss of voters to @entity3 could be crucial in deciding the outcome of the @entity145 on may 7 – with the prime minister now facing a race against time to win them back			1
for all voters , six in ten electors say they are unhappy about the @entity9 handling of the nation 's borders			1
a significant number of voters also insist immigration is still not being discussed enough by the politicians			0
during the current campaign , the @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity157 @entity69 have all avoided talking about the subject			1
the poll will now put pressure on the prime minister to change course and begin promoting his policies – which are far tougher than any advocated by @entity10			0
the public considers @entity10 and the @entity9 to be just as bad as one another when it comes to getting a grip			1
alarmingly for mr @entity71 , only 27 per cent think the current government 's handling of immigration has been better than under the previous @entity10 government – and 26 per cent say they 're handling it worse			0
the rest say both are the same			0
this is despite the fact @entity10 presided over a policy of open borders in which record numbers were allowed to pour into the @entity100 .			0

@entity24 survey for @entity23 shows @entity3 falling behind in key constituencies
latest in a series of polls showing the losing ground to the @entity9
@entity3 leader said he had ' made some mistakes ' by trying to do too much
he said he had to scale back his campaigning to rejuvenate himself
