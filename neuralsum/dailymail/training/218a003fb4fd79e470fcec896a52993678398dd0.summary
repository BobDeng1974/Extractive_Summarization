by @entity0 advertising and pr managers , event planners , and education administrators are all titles which are considered the ‘ best ’ jobs for women in 2014			2
according to a new study based on data from the @entity12 , which ranked the top 12 ' best ' jobs for women this year , dental hygienists and physical therapists are also rated highly as female - driven jobs			2
the top 12 , which is listed alphabetically rather than ranked in order , was compiled by @entity18 , and is based chiefly on the average salaries women can expect to earn in various jobs , coupled with each professions ’ ' projected hiring outlook ' - but it also takes into account factors including stress , physical demands and the percentage of women working in each field			1
female - friendly careers : @entity18 has ranked its take on the top 12 ' best ' jobs for women in 2014 , based on average salaries and the ' projected hiring outlook ' for various professions in the @entity34 at the top of the salary scale - just one deciding factor - was the role of an advertising and promotions manager , which earns women an average salary of $ 115,750			1
the projected hiring outlook however - calculated by comparing the number of women in that job in 2012 to the expected number in 2022 - is relatively low , at 12per cent			1
physical therapy , on the other hand , is described as ' an especially promising ' profession , with a projected hiring outlook of 36per cent , and an average salary of $ 79,860			1
at the lower end of the salary scale is event planning , with an average expectation of $ 45,810 a year , but with a high projected hiring outlook of 33per cent			1
the study also points out that 74.7per cent of event planners are women ; a factor that pushed certain professions up the scale			0
other job titles which women appear to dominate in terms of numbers versus men , according to the figures , include speech pathologists ( 93.4per cent of whom are female ) , dental hygienists , ( 98.3per cent ) and occupational therapists ( 88.4per cent )			0
a job as a computers systems analyst , with a salary of $ 79,680 , was also hailed as promising , for being ' one of many fast - growing jobs where gender takes a back seat to skill , experience and passion			0
' other jobs on the list in which women are reported to be earning ' compensation comparable to their male counterparts ' include human resource managers , education administrators and actuaries			0
to look purely at women 's salaries and the issue of the gender pay gap , @entity94 recently published a list - also using data from the @entity12 - which ranks the top 20 ' best - paying ' jobs for women in 2014			2
the most lucrative job title was found to be chief executive			0
although female chief executives make an average salary of $ 94,172 , they only make up only 21per cent of the profession in total , and earn 20per cent less than men at exactly the same level - which closely reflects the current average gender pay gap across all professions in the @entity34 @entity18 's top 12 list of best jobs for women has drawn some criticism based on its subjective nature			1
@entity120 considers : ' the angle of which jobs are best “ for women ” is offensive no matter what positions are listed , ' and points out that none of the jobs listed reach $ 100k , or surpass middle - management level			1
on a lighter note , regardless of skill - set , more and more women in today 's @entity34 are choosing entrepreneurship as a career path			0
the @entity34 @entity134 estimates that last year , 10.6 million women owned their own businesses , a significant jump from the 1990s , the study points out			0
