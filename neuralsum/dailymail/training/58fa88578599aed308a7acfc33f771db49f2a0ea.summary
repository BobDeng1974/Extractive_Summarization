by @entity1 reporter published : 06:31 est , 5 july 2012 updated : 07:18 est , 5 july 2012 recovered : @entity2 was delighted to find out her brain tumour had finally gone six years after she was diagnosed a mother owes her life to her daughter - after her pregnancy led doctors to discover a huge brain tumour that had been hidden in her skull for years			1
just hours after @entity2 gave birth to daughter @entity12 doctors found a tumour the size of a satsuma growing deep within her brain			1
they carried out emergency surgery in a bid to save her life and feared she might not make a full recovery			0
however , @entity2 , from @entity21 , fought back saying she was determined to watch her daughter grow up			2
now six years after her initial diagnosis , doctors have finally told the mother - of - one , 44 , that the tumour has gone - and will probably never return			1
@entity2 is now lobbying the government for more training to be given to medics to help them diagnose brain tumours earlier			2
@entity2 said : ' i ’d been suffering really severe sickness and blinding headaches all the way through my pregnancy - but i just assumed i was one of the unlucky people who had to put up with morning sickness for nine months solid			1
' i ’d had bad headaches for about three years before i got pregnant - but i put it down to stress			1
' i would wake up feeling like there was an axe buried in my head			0
but after @entity12 arrived , i felt like my brain was shutting down , and i suffered a huge fit			0
' i was stunned when doctors told me i had a tumour in my brain the size of a satsuma , which they thought had been growing for at least two years			1
' if i had n’t had @entity12 , it might have been too late by the time i was eventually diagnosed - she probably saved my life			2
' @entity2 in hospital following brain surgery			2
she lost her sense of smell during the operation @entity2 first started suffering from headaches in the year before she fell pregnant - but put the symptoms down to stress			1
she was running a health and beauty sales business at the time - working long hours and travelling around the country , and was convinced that the stress of her job , and pressure of keeping the business afloat , was affecting her health			0
but when she fell pregnant , the symptoms grew more severe - and she started to suffer from terrible nausea - which she believed was as a result of her pregnancy			1
@entity2 said : ' i was being horrendously sick all hours of the day , but i just thought i was unlucky with my pregnancy			2
' it got so bad that one day , when i was driving to a business meeting across a bridge over a river , i ended up being sick all over myself , as i could n’t pull over - it was awful			0
' the headaches i was suffering were changing too , they were really debilitating , but as a first - time mum , i did n’t know any different			2
' my sense of smell went wild - everything smelt to strongly , and made me feel ill. ' i even started to experience hand tremors , but after visiting the doctor , he put my symptoms down to stress during pregnancy , and sent me away			1
' when @entity12 did finally come along , i had a horrendous labour , which lasted for two and a half days , and after two episodes of shaking uncontrollably , i had an emergency c - section			0
' but immediately after the birth , i felt like i was closing down - i was exhausted , and could n’t enjoy @entity12 properly			0
' the tumour had been growing for around two years before it was discovered @entity2 said she felt like she was ' closing down ' after her daughter @entity12 was born			1
the next day she suffered a convulsion and was rushed to hospital although @entity2 was allowed home from hospital within hours , the next day , she suffered a convulsion while nursing @entity12 - and doctors realised something was seriously wrong			1
she said : ' @entity103 had left me nursing @entity12 with her lying on my chest - but when he came back into the room , i was convulsing and unconscious			0
' he quickly grabbed our baby and called an ambulance - and within hours , they had found out what was causing my symptoms			0
' the doctors said my tumour was big , and wrapped right around a cord in the middle of my brain			1
i was shocked , but i did n’t have time to be frightened for myself - i just knew i had to fight this for the sake of my baby			0
' nothing in this world was going to stop me from pushing her around in her pram			0
' @entity2 had risky surgery at the @entity126 to remove the tumour			2
the operation was a success - but surgeons were forced to damage the part of the brain which detects smell			0
although @entity2 made a steady recovery , doctors have kept a close eye on her , fearing the tumour would return , having regular scans			1
but now , medics have confirmed the tumour is unlikely to return - and have told her she no longer has to be monitored every few months			0
@entity2 two weeks after surgery to remove her brain tumour ( left )			1
right her inspiration - daughter @entity12 @entity2 , who is now writing a book about her recovery , said : ' it ’s such a relief to finally be told i can get on with the rest of my life - but i am starting to focus on campaigning for more funding and research into brain tumours			1
' @entity152 , charity development manager for @entity154 across @entity155 , said : ' research into brain cancers amounted to less than one per cent of the funds allocated for cancer research , and as was the case with @entity2 , diagnosis of brain tumours is often delayed			0
' symptoms can often be mistaken for side effects of other conditions , as @entity2 ’s were , and by the time one doctor has a @entity169 moment , diagnosis has often been delayed by several weeks			0
' we ’re lobbying the government to change that and provide better training for @entity174 in spotting tumours			0
