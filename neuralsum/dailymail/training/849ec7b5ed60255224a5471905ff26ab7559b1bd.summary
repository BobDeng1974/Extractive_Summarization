a petting zoo featuring light - up ' cyborg creatures ' instead of the usual rabbits and miniature goats has opened in @entity4			1
the robotic animals have bright , flexible tentacles and react when touched , much like a living animal , as each arm has features and ' personalities ' that change according to the activity of visitors			2
the interactive exhibition , created by a @entity16 architecture and design studio , intends to make visitors question how future environments could enable new forms of communication			2
@entity39 and @entity40 designed the artificially - intelligent creatures with the capacity to learn and explore behaviours through interaction with participants , using @entity48 's @entity47 sensors			1
the animals show ' emotions ' when touched by moving , lighting up and making sounds and evolve their behaviours over time , which the designers said allow the pets to develop their own ' personalities '			1
the designers created the artificially - intelligent creatures with the capacity to learn and explore behaviours through interaction with participants , using @entity48 's @entity47 sensors writing on the company 's website , they said : ' within this immersive installation interaction with the pets foster human curiosity , play , forging intimate exchanges that are emotive and evolving over time			1
' beyond technology the project explores new forms of enabled communication between people and their environment			0
' as well as reacting to humans , the robots are also able to communicate with each other			0
the animals ( pictured ) show emotions when touched by moving , lighting up and making sounds and evolve their behaviours over time , which the designers said allow the pets to develop their own personalities as well as reacting to humans , the robots are also able to communicate with each other @entity85 patterns of observation allow the pets to synchronise movements and behavioural responses			1
other technology lets the pets evolve relationships and avoid repetitive behaviour			0
the robotic creatures are aware of humans thanks to camera tracking and data scanning technology			2
real - time camera streams are processed and coupled with ' blob tracking ' and optical flow analysis to locate people and read their gestures			0
@entity85 patterns of observation allow the pets to synchronise movements and behavioural responses			0
they also develop personalities to avoid repetitive behaviour , according to the designers the robotic creatures are aware of humans thanks to camera tracking and data scanning technology that lets them identify human presence in their environment if a person stays still and is not taking an interest in the pets in the environment , they can stimulate responses of disinterest and boredom in the animals			1
groups of humans can interact with the animals by the ability of the system to identify and map in real - time the number of people seeking attention			1
minimaforms was founded in 2002 by brothers @entity40 and @entity132 as an experimental architecture and design practice			0
the duo explore new forms of communication and aim to push the boundaries of art , architecture and design by constructing spaces of ' social and material interaction '			0

@entity32 is the latest work by two brothers who make up the @entity36 studio and is on show in @entity4
