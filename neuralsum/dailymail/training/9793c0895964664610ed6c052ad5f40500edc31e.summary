but the combative @entity3 came out fighting , declaring : ‘ i am prepared to go into the town square and kill myself in front of everyone if i should be found guilty of such a crime			1
hot water : retired @entity18 midfielder @entity3 is under investigation for match - fixing in @entity29 winner : @entity3 made 73 appearances for @entity29 and won the @entity32 @entity13 in 2006 ‘ after all , my life would be meaningless from that point on			1
i would not have the courage to look anyone in the eye			2
i say that from the heart			2
‘ in my life , i have never sat down with anyone to fix games , nor have i ever thought to , as i would n’t even know where to start			2
‘ i do n’t even play five - a - side football with my friends because i ca n’t stand losing			2
this matter is absurd and unbelievable			0
i do n’t know what they want from me			0
i do n’t know what match - fixing is			1
‘ i am angry and offended			0
i do not want to have this stain on my career and my character			0
’ battle - hardened : @entity50 signed a 19 - year - old @entity3 for @entity51 club @entity4 in 1997 the two - time @entity53 winner , who held talks with @entity4 boss @entity55 and then - chief executive @entity56 about a spectacular return to @entity58 in the summer of 2012 , was named in a prosecutor ’s report released to the @entity11 media yesterday			1
his home was raided as part of a widespread swoop by @entity65 , including the arrest of four men — among them @entity68			0
the report issued yesterday shows 13 texts from @entity68 to @entity3 , as well as a number to former @entity73 player @entity72			1
prosecutor @entity74 said : ‘ @entity3 and @entity72 were connected to the case by the use of phone taps			1
we ’ve made four arrests and 16 searches			0
some of these searches have produced a positive outcome			0
we found notes and notebooks whose contents were based on betting			0
’ familiar face : @entity3 made 51 appearances during his time with @entity4 , scoring five goals but @entity3 hit back , declaring : ‘ the phone records show @entity68 sent me 13 text messages			1
they will , therefore , also show i never replied to any of them			0
this man knows half of @entity96 , he came to the @entity98 gates like many hundreds of others			2
he was a bookmaker in @entity100 , but i never talked about fixing games			2
controversy : @entity104 were relegated from @entity96 in 2006 as a result of a match - fixing scandal ‘ match - fixing is just not part of who i am			1
i made some bets when it was still allowed , but as soon as it was barred for professionals , i stopped			0
‘ i am accused not of placing bets , but of fixing games , and i ca n’t understand how they can do that			2
‘ i was in @entity118 , so only found out about the raid from my wife , after police took me in to sign some papers			0
i hope the magistrate calls me in soon because i want to clarify my position			0
‘ i had also been dragged into this affair two years ago			0
i am convinced and fully aware of my innocence			0
i spent my entire career working hard			0
i have a foundation that allowed me to give away £ 1.25million to help children and then people suggest i fixed games to earn more ? it just does n’t make sense			0
’ feeling the force : @entity3 is challenged by @entity136 's @entity135 during an @entity137 @entity3 ’s home was raided on tuesday on the strength of phone calls and text messages that , according to the report of the investigating judge , cast some suspicion on the @entity11 international			1
excerpts from the report make special mention of calls and messages — the content of which remains unknown — between @entity3 and @entity68 , referred to as ‘ mr y ’ in an investigation that has so far seen widespread arrests in @entity29 , @entity155 and @entity156			1
the report , which focuses heavily on @entity18 ’s title - winning season of 2010 - 11 , reads : ‘ there were contacts on the occasion of the match between @entity164 and @entity18 on february 20 , 2011			1
‘ these indicate a further element of particular importance , indicative of relations with the professional football world — contacts with the player of @entity18 , @entity3 … ‘ the analysis of telephone contacts of @entity68 , at the mentioned match , has revealed the singular coincidence of a contact ( @entity178 outbound ) with a user name to @entity180 footballer @entity3			1
’ heartbreak : @entity3 was part of the @entity4 side that lost the @entity183 to @entity184 in 1998 @entity185 - based @entity74 , who has worked alongside fellow prosecutors from @entity187 and @entity118 , said the latest arrests show that little has moved on since the ‘ @entity193 ’ match - rigging scandal of 2006 which resulted in the demotion of champions @entity104 to @entity192 ‘ i ’m not a commentator and i ’m not here to pontificate , ’ he said			1
‘ but we are faced with some clear facts that , despite the arrests and investigation , most of these people continue to do what they did before ( @entity193 )			2
‘ there are 30 matches in @entity96 in which there are contacts between @entity68 and the players or managers who are linked to the team playing the next day or two days later			1
‘ there clearly has n’t been much reaction to what happened before , because things are carrying on just as usual for these people			0
