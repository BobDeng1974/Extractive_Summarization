planning on stealing someone else 's partner ? you might want to rethink that in the light of new research			2
while ' mate poaching ' is incredibly common , three separate studies examined whether luring someone away from another results in a healthy , long - term relationship			2
@entity11 says that if you 've got your eyes on someone who is spoken for you could be in for a bumpy relationship the answer in a nutshell is no. poached partners tend to be in more dysfunctional relationships , make less reliable mates and are less satisfied and committed than people who were single and available when you met			1
they 're also ( surprise , surprise ) more likely to cheat and had more narcissistic traits			1
not quite such an attractive option after all			2
what astounds me , is that people ever thought it was			0
i never quite believe it when married guys claim they get hit on far more frequently when sporting a wedding ring , than without			0
( is this really true ? ) if someone is already taken - and by that i mean dating , living with or married to someone else - surely that not only makes them off limits but far less appealing			0
not wanting to point out the obvious but how can you trust someone who left someone else for you ? unsurprisingly poached partners are more likely to be repeat cheats , a new study has shown poached partner / affair - inspired relationships are nearly always riddled with insecurity and suspicion - for good reason			1
if you stole them , you know they 're capable of cheating because they 've done it with you			0
you 've been there when they 've claimed to be somewhere innocent , one hand holding their mobile and the other sliding up your thigh			0
so when they call to tell you they 're working late , your first thought is ' are they really ? what if they 're doing that to me ' it 's a lose - lose situation that does n't work on either side : whether you 're the person doing the stealing or the one being stolen			1
' poaching ' is often done by people with low self - esteem			0
taking someone else 's partner ' proves ' they are attractive , sexy and loveable after all			0
@entity11 does n't believe the saying ' you ca n't help who you fall in love with ' and says that we can control our feelings trouble is , that newfound confidence and security quickly drains away once the high of hooking them wears off - so they set off in search of another target , in search of another high			1
sometimes leaving the person they tempted ( who is n't in the habit of leaving for pastures new ) , staring bewildered at a ravaged life - shattered marriage , devastated children and nothing to show for it but being made to look like an idiot			1
i 'm aware ( and know personally ) of cases where women and men have fallen for other people 's partners , tried to fight the attraction but ca n't , been genuinely remorseful and years later , are still together and happy			1
but i still do n't believe it when people say ' you ca n't help who you fall in love with '			1
we all know , pretty early on , when we 're attracted to someone			0
if that someone happens to be out of bounds ( attached , a boss , your best friend 's boyfriend ) , the decent thing to do is recognise there is an attraction and avoid circumstances which would allow it to develop			0
this means not going for drinks after work when that unfairly sexy married man is part of the group ; opting out of the friendly invitation to ' pop out for a coffee ' with the stunning married neighbour who always seems to have a few too many buttons undone			0
we fall in lust and love ( usually in that order ) when we allow ourselves to			2
it does n't ' just happen ' , we 've allowed it to happen			2
it 's like the booze - fuelled one - night - stand that ' meant nothing because we were both drunk '			0
there 's a point in the evening when you face yourself in the mirror , realise you 're tipsy as hell , flirting like mad and ca n't be trusted to behave yourself			1
go straight back in and order another @entity149 and you might as well strip naked and do it right up there on the bar			0
who we fall in love with is n't out of our control , it 's a choice			1
given the end result of hooking up with someone attached is a rubbish relationship with pathetic chances of success , is n't it more sensible to focus on those who are free and able to offer a real chance at happiness ? for more advice on sex and love , visit @entity169			1

a recent study *suggests* that stolen partners make *bad* relationships
they are more likely to commit *adultery* and have narcissistic traits
@entity11 says that falling in love with the *wrong* person is avoidable
the sex expert does n't believe that we ca n't help who we fall in love with
