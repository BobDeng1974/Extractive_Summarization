' she looked just like she does now , only half the size			0
@entity16 's owner @entity15 ( pictured ) claims the rare condition does not affect the dog 's everyday life ' i took a photo and texted my husband			1
i told him i could n't take her back to the shelter as they would take one look at her and euthanize her			0
' he said no , but i won the argument and @entity16 came home			2
' i later found out these people bought her from craigslist for $ 50 from a backyard breeder located two hours away			0
@entity16 's condition became known to the world when pictures emerged of @entity67 back in june ' they only had @entity16 a couple of weeks			2
