this day was always likely to come ; it was just a question of how soon			2
@entity1 is back in an @entity3 shirt again - this time in the code he is still hurriedly attempting to crack			1
when the @entity6 take on the savagely - titled @entity7 ‘ wolfhounds ’ in @entity8 on friday night , there will be all manner of @entity11 players involved in what is , sadly , a rare ‘ a ’ - team international match			1
in a @entity16 year , so many fringe candidates for national service require these occasions to press their case , but most countries have dispensed with second - string sides - leaving a giant leap between the @entity22 and the senior ranks			2
but so much of the interest and the intrigue building up to this fixture has focused on league convert @entity1 , who has been on a crash - course in union at @entity41			1
the @entity67 are alert to the fascination , given the way the @entity70 has been prominent in all their news bulletins about the game , while there is curiosity in @entity7 about the visitors ’ rookie inside centre with the superstar profile			1
it was the same in @entity81 earlier this month , where @entity1 dominated discussions about @entity41 , before he was ruled out of the @entity84 encounter			1
while there are countless cynics keen to pour scorn on his efforts to learn a whole new ball game in time to become a @entity16 contender , the @entity3 management are not in that category			2
@entity1 is firmly in their thoughts and while a strong performance on friday night wo n’t thrust him into immediate @entity96 plans , he may be invited to join the senior squad to acclimatise to the surroundings			1
@entity1 drops the ball towards his foot and readies to kick it as he stands with his team - mates in training the @entity41 back ( centre ) laughs with his @entity3 team - mates as he walks on to the pitch at the @entity108 club @entity1 runs with the ball during a @entity111 match for @entity41 against @entity112 earlier this month as an 18 - stone - plus power runner who can off - load and tackles like a runaway train , his rise to the top of his new sport is surely a matter of time , as was friday night ’s preliminary taster			1
the proud patriot is relishing his first @entity124 outing , saying : ‘ it ’s great to be representing the country again and i ’m looking forward to it			0
you do n’t get too many chances to sing the anthem so you have to make the most of it every time you have the chance			2
’ the @entity96 is not a target @entity1 has in mind , as it has come too soon in his development phase			1
‘ i think it ’s a bit premature , ’ he added			0
maybe it is , but on friday night he can accelerate his second @entity3 career			1
@entity1 ( left ) gives instructions and stretches during training for @entity6 this week the centre joined @entity41 from @entity147 side @entity146 @entity148 of @entity149 ( left ) tackles @entity1 during a @entity111 match earlier this month when the official @entity96 twitter account made its latest reference to ‘ rugby ’s greatest championship ’ on tuesday , the account for the southern - hemisphere @entity152 bit back			1
the riposte was a wide - eyed face with ‘ * coughs * ’ alongside			0
that was it ; a subtle attempt to put @entity165 ’s blue - riband event in its place			0
it was also fair comment			0
every year , in these parts , we savour the thunderous tribal intensity of the annual neighbourly clashes , but purely in terms of playing standards , the @entity173 elite and @entity174 deliver a superior product			0
in terms of the overall package ; of atmosphere and colour , fervent cross-border tension and historical needle , not to mention the weekend festivals of revelry in the host cities , the @entity96 is top dog			0
but what it needs in this @entity16 year is to deliver heightened , trend - setting on - field standards , tactical innovations and new peaks of athletic prowess			0
it needs @entity195 and @entity196 to compete and it needs @entity197 to start equating to the sum of their parts again			0
if it has all of that and a fierce title fight , it can start using the ‘ greatest ’ claim with greater conviction			0
from left to right : captains @entity207 , @entity208 , @entity209 , @entity210 , @entity211 and @entity212 pose with the new @entity96 trophy ahead of the @entity96 tournament from left to right : coaches @entity216 , @entity217 , @entity39 , @entity218 , @entity219 and @entity220 pose with the trophy at the 2015 edition of the tournament was officially launched the new six - sided trophy ( left ) and the old trophy ( right ) , which has been around since 1993 @entity225 of @entity7 lifts the old trophy after they were crowned champions in 2014 @entity229 ’s heavily - financed quest to return to the @entity111 is bringing out director of rugby @entity231 ’s ruthless streak			1
the former @entity3 and @entity195 coach has banished wing @entity234 from the club , after the 23 - year - old agreed to join promotion rivals @entity238 at the end of the season			1
with the two clubs destined for a two - leg showdown in the @entity243 in may , @entity231 has ruled that @entity234 ’s decision to return to his home - town club means he is no longer welcome in the squad - for matches or even at training			1
‘ i need players who are 100 per cent committed in mind and body , ’ he said			0
‘ i felt that a player who was going to a rival , who we are potentially playing in the play - off final , i thought was unacceptable			2
with the quality that we have in the side , he wo n’t be missed			0
’ @entity231 has never sugar - coated his words , but even by his standards that is a blunt parting shot			1
on his watch , @entity229 will evidently take no prisoners … @entity229 director of rugby - and former @entity3 head coach - @entity231 has shown his ruthless side @entity231 has banished @entity234 from his squad after the winger signed a pre-contract with @entity238 international comeback story of the week - @entity268 described his meeting with @entity39 , which confirmed his recall to the @entity3 squad			1
‘ it was in the pub in @entity275 , ’ he said			0
‘ he probably thought it was my second home given my “ old - school ” tag ! it ’s a pub called @entity280			0
i did n’t actually know he was in there			0
there was a bar , a few stools and a fireplace there and i was 25 minutes early			0
i thought , “ well he is not here ” so i went to the loo and ordered a drink , then he sort of appeared from around the corner			0
’ asked what drink he had chosen , the @entity296 8 - without missing a beat - quipped : ‘ i ordered a pint with a triple - whiskey chaser ! ’ @entity268 has returned to the @entity3 fold - after meeting coach @entity39 at a pub in @entity275 @entity296 ' 36 - year - old forward @entity300 has been handed a recall to the @entity3 set - up @entity300 has been in out of the international picture for some time and was part of the ill - fated 2011 team last word it ’s been a week of eye - catching retirement announcements			1
@entity313 will stand down from all rugby at the end of the season , with no doubt about the timing of his move into a commercial role at @entity321 - the club he has served with distinction throughout his career			2
while the 35 - year - old wing may be best remembered for his ruled - out ‘ try ’ in the 2007 @entity325 , he is the all - time leading try - scorer in @entity111 rugby , whose current tally of 87 may stand as the benchmark for years to come , if @entity112 ’ @entity329 ca n’t surpass it			2
meanwhile , @entity331 has called time on his @entity334 career after being left out of the @entity96 squad			1
the @entity336 prop and decorated @entity337 was wounded by his omission , but this column would consider a small wager on him playing for his country again			0
@entity343 winger @entity313 ( centre left ) will bring his 14 - year playing career to an end this season @entity313 has enjoyed success as a @entity3 and @entity349 player throughout his career @entity334 ' @entity349 prop @entity331 had decided to call time on his international career even his successor , @entity353 of the @entity354 , remains in awe of the man known affectionately as ‘ bomb ’ , saying : ‘ it ’s unbelievable how much @entity331 has achieved and he is , i reckon , still @entity334 ’ best tighthead			1
’ for now , that may not be the coaches ’ view , but do n’t bet against a re-think if injuries take hold			2
the 33 - year - old in action during a @entity349 training session in june 2013 @entity331 ( right ) and @entity369 ( left ) celebrate @entity96 success			2

@entity1 will make his @entity6 debut in @entity8 on friday night
rugby league convert will play at inside centre against @entity376
@entity39 is flying across to @entity8 to keep tabs on his second string
@entity229 director of rugby @entity231 has *displayed* his ruthless streak
he has banished @entity234 from squad for joining rivals @entity238
@entity331 may have retired from international duty with @entity334 , but do *n't* bet against him wearing the red shirt again in the *future*
