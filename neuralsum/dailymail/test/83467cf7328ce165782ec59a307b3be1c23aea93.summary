one problem with space travel is that humans are n’t very good at coping with reduced gravity - their bones and muscles deteriorate over time			1
but one company says they have an answer - a giant rotating space cylinder that can create artificial gravity			1
their giant cylinder ( shown , with the @entity16 illustrated ) could apparently replace the iss. it would rotate four times per minute to create artificial gravity , and would be 1,300ft ( 400 metres ) long , cost £ 200 billion ( $ 300 billion ) and take 30 years to build the ‘ space mushroom ’ was designed by @entity20 and @entity21 from @entity13 ( @entity22 ) , based in @entity12 , @entity12 the final design would be 330ft ( 100 metres ) in diameter and 1,310ft ( 400 metres ) long			1
@entity26 orbiting space station - planetary environmental monitoring / research solar system space vehicle settlement cargo vehicle & construction platform rescue vehicle continuously looping space ferry system mining vehicle / platform manufacturing platform bio-medical research / manufacturing artificial gravity is created by spinning the station 4.22 times per minute around its vertical axis , creating downward pressure via the centrifugal force to keep objects - including humans - on the floor			1
the force would be the same as the gravity experienced on @entity48			0
meanwhile on the @entity50 , the station is in constant freefall towards @entity48 as it orbits the planet - so the astronauts live in ‘ zero - gravity ’			2
while the main cylindrical body would spin in one direction , the top dome - shaped section would spin in the other direction			0
this would allow spacecraft to dock with the top of the station , which would appear stationary to them			0
the necessity for this dome gives the space station its mushroom - like appearance			1
the dome would house the command centre for the station , and also many of the supplies needed for the crew on board			0
‘ we believe artificial gravity is required to support long term living in space , ’ mr @entity20 told @entity74			1
to build the station , the team says they have ‘ patents pending ’ for six robotic systems that can manufacture and construct a variety of structures in space			2
while exact details are n’t known at the moment , another company - @entity86 - has demonstrated how structures could be built in space with their @entity91 proposal , a system of robo - spiders that would build parts of spacecraft in orbit , although mr @entity20 told @entity74 that the @entity22 method would be ' different '			1
mr @entity20 added that , for this large structure , it would take about 30 years to build and cost close to £ 200 billion ( $ 300 billion )			1
for comparison , it took more than 10 years to build the @entity50 , at a cost of around £ 67 million ( $ 100 billion ) - although this new station has 2.89 million times more volume			1
and it would be ‘ large enough to transport all the people and equipment required to set up a colony on @entity110 and would orbit @entity110 and provide a safe environment while the @entity110 base is being constructed			0
’ artificial gravity has been considered many times before , most famously in the ' @entity116 ' design ( interior seen here )			1
a rotating station would allow people to live as if they were walking on @entity48 , allowing them to stay in space for long periods of time to build the station , something like @entity91 ( left ) could be used , a proposed system of robo - spiders than can construct solar panels , trusses and other parts of spacecraft in orbit			2
on the right is an artificial gravity test @entity135 performed in september 1966			2
the @entity137 spacecraft was attached to an agena target vehicle and spun , with the astronauts reporting a small amount of artificial gravity in their spacecraft on the @entity50 , the station is in constant freefall towards @entity48 as it orbits the planet - so the astronauts live in ‘ zero - gravity ’			1
however , they actually still experience about 90 per cent of @entity48 's gravity , but the constant falling makes them seem weightless inside , the structures would be spinning so anyone on the curved ‘ floors ’ around the edges would be pushed into the ground , simulating gravity on @entity48			0
but mr @entity20 said they want to build a smaller structure first , to prove the design works			0
‘ our first structure will be 30 metres [ 100ft ] in diameter , it will create a 0.6 gravity environment and would house at least 30 people , ’ he said			1
this smaller structure would cost between £ 3.5 and £ 7 billion ( $ 5 and $ 10 billion ) , and could be built in the next 10 years			2
it would take just 12 to 18 months to build , according to mr @entity20			0
‘ @entity167 is estimated to be decommissioned around 2024 , ’ mr @entity20 noted			0
the team has yet to begin any serious construction or testing as of yet - so at the moment , the station remains somewhat of a pipe dream			0
astronauts on the @entity50 ( @entity175 seen left , @entity176 on the right ) live in a constant state of micro-gravity			0
mr @entity176 is spending a year on the @entity50 to see what effects such conditions have on the human body for a prolonged period of time in the 1968 film 2001 : a @entity186 , astronauts are shown running around a spacecraft that spins ( shown ) while on a mission to deep space , creating artificial gravity for them to operate in previous concepts for spacecraft include this 1969 station that would rotate on its central axis to produce artificial gravity			2
the majority of early space station concepts created artificial gravity one way or another in order to simulate a more natural or familiar environment for the health of the astronauts on board however , space settlement expert @entity206 , who is also a contract scientist at @entity135 's @entity209 , told @entity74 that he thought the idea was somewhat sound - and artificial gravity was a necessity for prolonged stays in space			1
‘ rotation to provide artificial gravity will counteract most , if not all , of the negative effects of micro-g , ’ he said			2
and he says if we truly want to live in space , including raising children there , it will be necessary to create such a station			0
‘ there is no data on the effects of micro-g on kids , but it is safe to assume they will grow up very weak as muscles and bones develop in response to stress , ’ he continued			0
‘ thus , for settlement , there is simply no question that they must rotate and almost certainly need to provide 1g at least for the first few generations			0
’ but whether this station will be the answer remains to be seen			0
several other proposals for a rotating space station have been drawn up - including a @entity135 concept called @entity246 - but as of yet , there are no concrete plans by @entity135 , @entity249 ( the @entity249 ) or any other nation on what to do after the @entity50 whether this station by @entity13 or another concept will be built , remains to be seen			1
@entity135 's @entity246 concept , shown , includes a doughtnut - shaped spinning section in the middle where astronauts can experience artificial gravity			2
the spacecraft is designed for long trips to the moon , @entity110 or beyond while a spacecraft could be created with artificial gravity , astronauts will still have to contend with zero - gravity conditions if they ever venture outside into space			1
shown are @entity135 's @entity267 ( left ) and @entity269 's @entity268 above @entity270 in 2006			0

@entity12 company @entity13 wants to create a new space station
it rotates four times a minute to create artificial gravity - with the ' stem ' and ' dome spinning in *opposite* directions
it would be 1,300ft ( 400 metres ) long , cost £ 200 billion ( $ 300 billion ) and take 30 years to build
