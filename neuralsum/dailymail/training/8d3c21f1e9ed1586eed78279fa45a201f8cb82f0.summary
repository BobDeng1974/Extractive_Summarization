@entity1 manager @entity0 is in an unprecedented position , with all those responsible for selecting him for the post having left or being set to leave the @entity6			1
@entity0 was chosen to replace @entity7 in april 2012 , shortly before @entity8 , by the @entity1 quartet of @entity10 , sir @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13			1
chairman @entity10 left in june 2013 having reached the age limit of 70 , football director @entity11 retired from the @entity6 after the @entity16 , general secretary @entity12 is departing at the end of january and club @entity1 managing director @entity13 goes after @entity19			1
@entity1 manager @entity0 ( right ) speaks with @entity6 chairman @entity20 , who replaced @entity10 as @entity6 chairman in 2013 , at the dedication ceremony for the @entity23 @entity0 's supporters are gone ( as in the case of @entity10 , left ) or going ( in the case of @entity13 ) but with the dismantling of the @entity1 set - up responsible for picking the national team boss , after the previous marginalisation of the @entity31 , @entity0 has no one to report to on a daily basis such is the vacuum at the top of the @entity6			1
@entity0 , having been fortunate to survive the @entity16 debacle , has since guided @entity1 to the top of their @entity39 group with an 100 per cent record			1
so there is no immediate debate around his future			2
but with the 2018 @entity16 qualifying draw taking place in @entity46 next july , the @entity6 will soon have to address whether @entity0 , whose contract runs until 2016 , should be given a new deal before that or be judged purely on the @entity39 results			1
@entity0 has led @entity1 through @entity39 qualifying undefeated , so his position for now is safe @entity52 may leave it as late as their executive committee meeting on january 27 - two days before the deadline for candidates for the @entity58 election - before deciding whether to distance themselves from a @entity61 coronation or throw their weight behind a challenger			1
prince @entity65 remains the most likely opponent to @entity61 from outside @entity67 who @entity52 would endorse			2
but @entity65 ’s situation is complicated by the president of his @entity70 , @entity71 , having already publicly supported @entity61			0
@entity74 overlord @entity72 might still be persuaded to stand , but he is worried about whether he will have the total backing of his own confederation			0
@entity52 could leave it late to decide if they support a challenger to @entity58 president @entity61 's re-election @entity58 ethics chief @entity81 ’s resignation will at least stop him harassing @entity6 chairman @entity20 about his non-return of the £ 16,000 @entity83 watch gifted to him at the @entity84 last june by the @entity86 football federation			1
@entity81 has written a number of letters to @entity20 claiming he is now in breach of the ethics code despite the @entity92 attorney failing to disclose how many of the 65 watches handed out have been given back			0
@entity20 , who has paid import duty and intends to auction the watch for the @entity6 breast - cancer charity , was planning to show his disdain for @entity98 by handing out watches to all guests at the @entity6 media @entity19 drinks			2
@entity58 ethics chief @entity81 's resignation will get him off @entity20 's back about that @entity105 watch the word inside the @entity107 is that @entity108 itself might have been behind the story about sharing @entity112 coverage with subscription channel @entity113 to save money			0
it is the scenario that would have to happen if the licence fee is frozen or scrapped and the @entity107 might have wanted the negative reaction to them losing @entity112 , or part of it , out there as a message to @entity123			0
@entity58 president @entity61 is obviously staying in one of the best suites of @entity127 ’s famous @entity126 for the @entity129 meeting there on thursday and friday			0
but it is reassuring at least , considering his anti-english stance , that @entity61 is not booked into the sir @entity133 suite named in honour of the former prime minister ’s stays there and where one of his self - portraits still hangs			2
@entity61 is in a fine suite at @entity127 's famous @entity126 , but not the sir @entity133 suite @entity142 in @entity144 rumpus the @entity142 are involved in yet another rumpus , with plans to close down non-achieving high - performance centres			2
the @entity142 gave notice that funding would stop next september			0
but @entity149 , who do n’t like the inconvenience to their members of the @entity142 centre at their posh @entity155 club in @entity156 , are cutting links in january leaving 100 top young players between nine and 19 with nowhere to train at short notice and angry parents complaining to the @entity142			0
an @entity142 spokeswoman said it was a @entity149 matter .			0

@entity0 replaced @entity7 in april 2012 , before @entity8
he was appointed by the quartet of @entity10 , sir @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 , who will all soon have left the @entity6
the @entity6 soon must decide if @entity0 stays beyond his 2016 contract
