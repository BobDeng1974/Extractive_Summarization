by @entity1 reporter published : 06:42 est , 3 december 2013 @entity3 : 09:53 est , 3 december 2013 @entity5 activists are pressing ahead with demands to pray at a contested @entity8 holy site prompting potentially explosive clash with @entity10 over the right to worship there the @entity12 / @entity12 is one of the world 's most contested religious locations because the 35 acre site has religious significance to both jews and @entity10			1
according to @entity5 tradition , it is the former site of @entity20 , also known as the @entity20			1
friction : @entity5 activists have set their sights on @entity8 's @entity12 , prompting potentially explosive clash with @entity10 over right to worship there its western flank contains the @entity26 and many @entity5 face the direction of the mount when praying			1
the same area is known to @entity10 as the @entity12 ( the @entity12 )			2
the location is important to @entity10 as they believe it is where the @entity32 travelled to before ascending to @entity34 - @entity5 are banned from public worship there			1
for @entity39 , having their future capital in @entity8 is a fundamental element of any future state			0
each week , hundreds of @entity5 visit the site of their destroyed temple , in the heart of the disputed capital ’s @entity45			1
visitors are closely watched by both the police and the @entity10 religious officials of the @entity50 who administer the compound and keep an eye out to make sure no @entity5 worship takes place			1
although they have police escorts they concoct elaborate ways to worship - some of them pretend to use a mobile phone to whisper forbidden prayers while others carry out banned bows by dropping coins and then bending to pick them up			0
@entity65 border policemen load their weapons before patrolling at the @entity26 in @entity8 's @entity45 anyone wearing @entity5 religious dress is generally kept away from the @entity70 holy tract			1
but now a group of @entity5 activists are pressing for an end to the effective ban and their proposals are now being debated in the @entity65 parliament , although a november committee hearing on the matter in the @entity80 , @entity65 ’s parliament dissolved into a shouting match between legislators and @entity84 @entity65 lawmakers the @entity12 is a religious site found in the @entity45			1
according to @entity5 tradition , it is the former site of @entity20 , also known as the @entity20			1
its western flank contains the @entity26 and many @entity5 face the direction of the mount when praying			2
the location is also important to @entity10 , for whom the @entity12 is where the @entity32 traveled to before ascending to @entity34			1
due to its importance to both religions , the site is one of the world 's most contested religious locations			1
' we ’re looking for it to be divided between @entity101 , ' said @entity102 , chairman of the @entity103 , which claims 27 groups under its umbrella , reported the @entity106			0
' today , @entity5 realize the @entity26 is not enough			2
they want to go to the real thing			0
' wedged into the compound atop the ramparts of @entity8 's walled @entity45 is @entity110 , originally erected 1,300 years ago , rebuilt in the 11th century after an earthquake and now @entity70 's third holiest site , and the 7th - century golden @entity114 shrine , the oldest known @entity70 monument			1
the plaza , from which the @entity117 is traditionally believed to have ascended into heaven , has an explosive past as a core issue of the @entity65 - @entity39 conflict			0
@entity65 captured the area , along with the rest of @entity8 , the @entity124 and @entity125 , in the 1967 @entity127 war			0
the jewish state then annexed @entity8 as part of its capital in a move never recognised internationally			0
in 2000 , @entity39 protests over a visit to the site by then @entity65 opposition leader @entity135 spiralled into deadly clashes and a five - year @entity39 uprising in which thousands died			2
@entity39 religious affairs minister @entity138 said in may the conflict over the plaza ' may lead to an explosion ' and that @entity39 authorities had complained to the @entity143 and other @entity26 intermediaries			0
@entity39 concerns have been heightened , however , by the fact that allies of @entity65 prime minister @entity148 are among the most vocal advocates of @entity5 prayer at the site			1
@entity39 president @entity152 has denounced the @entity65 visits as a part of a ' dangerous and an evil plot to demolish @entity110 ' and build what he calls ' an alleged temple '			0
dispute : the @entity12 is a religious site found in the old city in @entity8 , covering an area of 35 acres also in may , @entity65 housing minister @entity162 , a @entity5 settler in the occupied @entity124 who is from the far - right @entity163 , said in a largely tongue - in - cheek remark in parliament that he would ' definitely be happy ' to be assigned the job of rebuilding a new holy temple			1
while some @entity5 zealots advocate such construction , such a project has never been on the agenda of @entity65 governments			2
however , one member of @entity148 's @entity174 , legislator @entity175 , visited the compound on the eve of her wedding earlier this year			0
she said her pilgrimage was symbolic of a historic yearning ' to rebuild on the ruins of @entity8 '			0
a @entity174 colleague , @entity182 , has said the site should be shared between @entity70 and @entity184 so that @entity5 could pray there openly			2
two @entity10 women sit inside the @entity114 mosque located in the @entity110 compound @entity65 police have barred further visits by another @entity174 lawmaker , @entity190 , an ultra-rightist who has been arrested in the past for what police said were attempts to worship on the plaza			2
officials said they feared @entity190 's presence could stir violent @entity39 protests			0
most of those campaigning for @entity5 prayer in the compound represent a far - right minority , but many @entity10 ' see a provocation , and blame the ( @entity65 ) government , so we have a big problem " , said @entity65 political scientist @entity208			1
many @entity209 once rejected the idea of praying in the compound , citing religious rules barring anyone not descended from one of the ancient priests from stepping on hallowed ground where holy scriptures were once kept			0
@entity65 has held @entity5 prayers instead at the nearby @entity26 remnant of one of the ancient temples			2
but the idea of holding prayers inside the elevated compound as well has acquired more political significance over the years			0
@entity226 @entity65 fear that yielding any control over the compound could lead to a withdrawal from other occupied territory they see as a biblical birthright and which @entity39 seek for a state			0
' this is n't a religious issue at all " @entity190 told @entity236 in a recent interview			0
' the question is who does the mount belong to , the @entity5 or the @entity84 ? ' friction at the site also looms over an @entity65 plan to expand the concrete prayer plaza at the @entity26 , one of @entity184 's holiest sites , to try and accommodate @entity5 seeking more liberal prayer services than most @entity209 custom permits			1
currently @entity65 must deploy hundreds of police to prevent violence whenever angry @entity252 protesters confront women activists who hold monthly prayer sessions at the site			0
@entity10 reject any @entity65 construction in the area , though , and worry that any expansion of the @entity26 plaza may involve moving the footbridge at what is known as the @entity263 entrance to the compound and its @entity70 holy sites .			2
