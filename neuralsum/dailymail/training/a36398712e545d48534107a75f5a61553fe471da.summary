by @entity0 her sky - high exploits have been documented recently , with tales of champagne - fuelled parties around the world , run - ins with celebrities and mingling with sir @entity8 himself			2
but for @entity10 , 40 , from @entity11 , @entity12 , being an air stewardess with @entity14 was n’t just about having fun and games in @entity17 and glamorous locations			1
in fact , being groped , having food thrown at her and looking after a woman who ’d suffered a miscarriage in the economy toilets – all the while maintaining an air of calm professionalism – were more common			1
’ and she does n’t hold back about the on and off - board antics			2
speaking to @entity39 , @entity10 elaborates on some of the best anecdotes from her book , as well as sharing some scandalous tales that did n’t quite make the final cut			1
‘ obviously we had a lot of fun times but i did leave a lot out because i did n’t want it to seem like that was all we did , ’ she says			2
‘ the @entity14 crew are professional and diligent and i wanted to make sure that came across			1
’ a quieter life : @entity10 says she would n't swap her virgin days for anything , but is now happily married with a daughter and you can forget the @entity57 , according to @entity10 it was the passengers who are the worst behaved mid-air			1
‘ the book charts 10 years and in that time i knew of only two instances where cabin crew messed about – one stewardess on my flight was caught giving oral sex to a famous boyband member but she was sacked on the spot , they take that very seriously			2
‘ the passengers behaved far worse , especially in @entity68 because they think they ’re better than @entity68 , but actually ca n’t afford @entity69			2
flying high : @entity10 worked as an air stewardess at @entity14 for 10 years ‘ i had a man throw pizza in my face once because he said it was n’t good enough for his son to eat			1
‘ and one businessman was travelling in @entity17 and getting it on at the bar with a fellow female passenger			2
they ’d had a few drinks and had a few snogs			2
literally five minutes later his wife walked through to see him			2
she ’d been sitting back in @entity68 with no idea what was going on ! we were shocked			2
’ and the mother of a very famous @entity90 star , travelling without her son , head - butted one of @entity10 ’s colleagues , causing her nose to bleed			1
‘ she boarded and threw her fur coat at me , ordering me to store it away , ’ remembers @entity10			1
‘ i knew then that she ’d be trouble			2
‘ it ’s also public knowledge that she and her son do n’t get on very well			0
she had a few drinks throughout the flight and took sleeping pills , then all of a sudden went crazy and had to be wrestled to the ground			0
‘ she head - butted my colleague who was merely trying to restrain her outburst , and her nose burst open and i do n’t even think she ever apologised			0
we have to put up with a lot ! ’ in the book @entity10 also describes having to sew up a man whose five stitches in his stomach had burst open , and the trauma of finding a passenger in the plane 's toilet , who had just suffered a miscarriage			1
' i gathered plastic aprons , surgical gloves , face masks and cloths from our first - aid supplies in the galley and returned to the scene with more crew to help , ' says @entity10			1
' we have to be calm and helpful in all situations , nothing can faze us			0
no matter how upsetting , we are there to help			0
' and it 's not just unruly and amorous passengers that make it a difficult job – frequent flying and conflicting time zones take their toll			0
constant wind , ibs and even missing periods are just par for the course			0
famous friends : during her hey day as as member of @entity14 's @entity141 , @entity10 , right , partied all around the world and even met @entity143 , left , after a gig he 's the boss ! sir @entity8 , left , was ' amazing ' to work for , says @entity10 , right , who was an air stewardess for ten years with the @entity14 mogul ‘ going up and down so often plays havoc with the gases released in your body and the different time zones and poor diet really mess you up too , ’ says @entity10			1
‘ most crew members have ibs and i did n’t have a period for seven months because my body clock was so all over the place			0
‘ and anyone who thinks stewardesses are sexy should know that it ’s not stockings and suspenders we wear under our uniform – it ’s support tights and girdles to prevent varicose veins ! ’ on the plus , travelling first class and having exotic holidays is n’t too shabby			0
even when @entity10 was n't working she 'd be upgraded on every flight and even took her mum on a seven - day shopping spree in @entity175			1
and week - long stop overs meant lots of partying			0
@entity10 says : ‘ we once had a week in @entity180 , staying in a top hotel for free			1
there was a group of us and it was one big party			0
cabin fever : the sizzling secrets of a @entity14 air hostess by @entity10 and @entity187 , £ 9.99 , is available now ‘ after a few drinks in our rooms we all went skinny dipping in the sea , but someone ran off with our clothes			1
' not only did we have to head back through the hotel completely naked , but one girl lost a bet so had to swim in every pool of the hotel , naked , before she was allowed back			0
' it was like an office @entity200 , but lasting several nights every month			0
’ @entity10 ’s most raucous party was a stag do in the city of sin itself , @entity206 , which she said was ‘ too raucous ’ to leave in the book			1
‘ the boyfriend of one of the crew members was on the stag do of a @entity213 model , ’ she says			1
‘ they invited a few of us girls along			0
no expense was spared , he ’d hired huge private marquees outside one of the biggest nightclubs in the city with drinks flowing			0
‘ afterwards we all went back to their hotel suite which was massive			0
people were getting it on all over the place and drugs were lined up on the tables , though of course we did n’t touch them because @entity14 do random drug tests			1
‘ we certainly took advantage of all the free champagne though ! ’ and @entity10 recalls meeting @entity143 at a party sir @entity8 threw for their inaugural flight to @entity238			1
' it was a lavish white marquee on tip of the bay with a @entity242 fly over , ' she says			0
' there were huge cocktails , @entity143 sang @entity8 even joined in with the backing dancers for a rendition of @entity247 when @entity248 performed ! ' they all stripped off to @entity251 shorts for the finale			0
@entity143 was such a genuinely lovely man			0
unfortunately no one in @entity254 knew who he was but all the crew ran to the stage & were singing along with all his songs			0
just another normal night out with the crew ! ' now , @entity10 lives a quiet life with her husband , @entity262 , 40 and daughter who is two years old			1
in @entity264 , but says she would n’t swap her colourful life with @entity14 for anything			1
‘ i made amazing friends and went all over the world , ’ she says			0
' i would n’t change a thing			0
