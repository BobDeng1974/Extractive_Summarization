a conservative @entity1 congressman released a bumper sticker that infuriated his opponents by connecting the debate over abortion with that of gun control			2
campaign staffers working on the re-election team for @entity11 congressman @entity10 released the bumper sticker today prompting an immediate backlash			1
' if babies had guns they would n't be aborted			0
vote pro-life ! ' the bumper sticker read			2
fire starter : the bumper sticker was released via @entity17 by the @entity10 's campaign staff right wing : congressman @entity10 , who invited rocker @entity21 as his guest to the @entity23 , sells himself as the most conservative member of @entity25 , though he has not been ranked as such the slogan was deemed ' outrageous ' by the masses on @entity17 , many of whom stopped to think about the physical impossibilities implied , but few missed the political implications			1
the statement is obviously intended to prompt outrage from critics and serve as a rallying cry from supporters , but a day after posting it to his @entity17 feed , it apparently helped fund his campaign war chest for his 2014 re-election bid			1
his campaign managers are trying to position him on the far right of the party , appointing him the ' most conservative congressman in @entity11 ! ' in his @entity17 bio			1
the bio goes on to boast of his ' 100 % lifetime @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 rating '			0
@entity53 : @entity10 connected the bumper sticker to the ongoing trial of an abortion doctor who allegedly killed live babies and at least one mother in @entity59 support : @entity10 received campaign funds from pro-life and anti-gun control groups in spite of his own assertions , he is not listed among the top 16 most conservative congressman by the @entity68 in their annual rankings			1
though the bumper sticker was released by his campaign staff and not by the congressman himself , he found a way to make the move timely by tying it into the case against abortion doctor @entity77 in @entity78 who allegedly murdered seven babies in his ' house of horrors ' clinic			1
' funny how all it takes is a bumper sticker for @entity85 to finally start talking about the unborn like they 're people			0
hypocrisy exposed , ' the congressman tweeted friday afternoon			0
his strong allegiance to pro-life and anti-gun control groups comes as little surprise when looking at his campaign finance reports			0
in the 2012 election , the @entity94 , @entity95 , and the @entity96 were among his top 20 donors			0
@entity10 represents a district of southeast @entity11 that was created as a result of the 2010 census , so he is the first to serve as its representative			2
he previously served as a congressman from 1995 to 1997 .			0
