he is still two months away from his official debut but @entity2 already knows how it feels to hear the @entity4 chant his name			1
now begins the difficult task of watching from the sidelines until october 25 as his new team - mates start the season without him			0
the former @entity12 striker was finally presented to @entity14 supporters at the @entity4 on monday night before @entity14 's 6 - 0 win over @entity16 , five weeks after signing for the club , and four days after his @entity19 ban on all football activity was lifted			1
an hour before the club 's final pre-season friendly kicked off the stadium was predictably still less than half full but the roar was still huge and his name was chanted as he trotted out wearing the number nine shirt			0
he finally made his entrance against the @entity77 side captained by former @entity14 defender @entity78 on 76 minutes replacing @entity29 , by which time @entity14 were already 4 - 0 ahead and had made nine changes			1
@entity50 scored after three minutes from a @entity82 pass and @entity82 netted on 12 minutes after a brilliant through ball from @entity60			2
@entity82 made it three , two minutes before the break when beating @entity16 ’s offside trap he ran on to a @entity50 pass , flicked the ball past @entity88 in the visitor ’s goal and then with an outrageous back - heel found the back of the empty net			1
the @entity94 was taken off at half - time after his first 45 minutes since cracking a vertebrae but it was @entity98 who replaced him and not @entity2			2

he confirmed his status as top scorer in pre-season converting @entity119 ’ cross after the @entity94 had been picked up by @entity158 ’s perfect pass			0
@entity2 came on with 14 minutes left but was joining the applause before he could really join the action as @entity98 scored again to make it 5 - 0 this time from a @entity126 pass			1
@entity126 completed the rout on the whistle scoring to make it 6 - 0			1
there were several neat passes from @entity2 but there was a decidedly pre-season air to that last quarter of an hour just as there had been pre-match when he was introduced along with the entire squad to what was still a half empty stadium			0
new coach @entity174 was first out to a back - drop of fireworks and applause			0
his squad followed him one by one with right - back @entity179 introduced first followed by @entity181 and @entity67			0
the volume increased considerably when @entity82 and @entity183 – two of the @entity14 players who did themselves justice at the @entity114 – trotted out to the centre - circle			2
meet and greet : @entity67 waves to tye fans as @entity14 's player take to the pitch new beginings : @entity2 lines up with his new @entity14 teammates before the friendly game against @entity103 @entity195 of a new era : @entity174 introduces the team ahead of the game at the @entity4 @entity199 focussed on team performance despite @entity2 debut @entity202 was the first new signing to be called on to the pitch followed by returning loanee @entity29 , @entity158 , young goalkeeper @entity205 , @entity207 keeper @entity206 , defenders @entity208 and @entity146 and to the biggest cheer of the night @entity2			1
the captains @entity140 , @entity50 , @entity212 and @entity66 were also roared on to the field before @entity66 took the microphone and welcomed @entity2 and the rest of the new signings to the club			2
with his first game under his belt and the @entity69 presented to the team , he disappeared down the tunnel a happy man – now for the 11 matches he will take no part in			0
