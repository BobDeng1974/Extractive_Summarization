@entity1 and other common supplements fuel lung cancer in smokers , researchers fear			1
they say that rather than preventing tumours , popular antioxidant pills may speed their growth and spread and hasten death			0
the experiments were done on mice , but the @entity12 researchers believe they are relevant to people			1
researchers warn that @entity1 and other common supplements ( pictured ) could fuel lung cancer in smokers			1
they say that rather than preventing tumours , popular antioxidant pills may speed their growth and spread and hasten death @entity1 helps maintain cell structure by protecting cell membranes			2
antioxidants , such as vitamins a , @entity24 and @entity1 , are credited with protecting against a host of ills , including cancer			1
but this study finds @entity1 and other supplements fuel lung cancer in smokers			1
@entity1 and other antioxidants are credited with boosting health by mopping up harmful molecules called free radicals			2
but it is thought that if cancer has already started to develop , they may actually feed the disease by switching off the body ’s natural defences			0
the scientists recommended vitamin and other antioxidants are ‘ used with caution ’ by smokers and lung cancer patients			1
@entity47 recently said that we should be able to get all the vitamins we need from a healthy diet , without resorting to supplements			0
antioxidants , such as vitamins a , @entity24 and @entity1 , are credited with protecting against a host of ills , including cancer			1
however , recent studies have hinted that in some cases they may actually fuel the disease			0
when the @entity60 researchers give vitamin e to mice in the very early stages of lung cancer , the disease grew and spread more quickly and the animals died twice as fast			1
experiments on human cells confirmed the finding			0
a second antioxidant , a drug used to treat smoking - related lung conditions , had a similar effect			0
@entity1 and other antioxidants are credited with boosting health by mopping up harmful molecules called free radicals , which are unstable and highly reactive so that in animal tissues they can damage cells			2
anyone can have small lung tumours that are yet to be spotted by doctors , but they are most common in smokers			0
a coloured x-ray of the chest of a 52 - year - old female patient with secondary lung cancer is pictured but it is thought that if cancer has already started to develop , antioxidants may actually feed the disease by switching off the body ’s natural defences			1
although anyone can have small lung tumours that are yet to be spotted by doctors , they are most common in smokers			0
the researchers said the amounts of vitamin e used were similar to those found in supplements			2
they advised that the vitamin and other antioxidants are ‘ used with caution ’ by smokers , lung cancer patients and people with bronchitis , emphysema and other smoking - related lung conditions known collectively as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease			1
they said it is too early to give any advice to healthy people – or to say if vitamins speed the spread of other cancers			2
@entity1 and other antioxidants are credited with boosting health by mopping up harmful molecules called free radicals ( illustrated ) the warning , published in the journal @entity127 , is unlikely to apply to vitamin - rich ‘ superfoods ’ such as blueberries as they would have to be eaten in huge amounts to provide the levels of antioxidants contained in supplements			1
dr @entity135 , of @entity47 ’s senior science communications officer , cautioned that the study was done on mice and it is not clear what it means for people			0
however , she added : ‘ there ’s no strong evidence that antioxidants or vitamin supplements could reduce cancer risk , and some types of supplement can actually raise the risk			0
‘ there have also been concerns raised that antioxidants may interfere with cancer treatments			0
‘ we recommend that people stick to a healthy , balanced diet , which should provide all the nutrients you need without taking supplements			0

@entity12 researchers made their findings in mice but believe the results are relevant to humans
@entity60 researchers found cancer spread more quickly in mice with the early stages of lung cancer , that were given vitamin c
antioxidants , such as vitamins a , @entity24 and @entity1 , are usually credited with protecting against a host of ills , including cancer
