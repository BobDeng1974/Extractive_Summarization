bureaucrats in @entity1 could push the price of petrol up in the @entity4 by 4p a litre by dictating ' green ' fuel targets to member states			1
under tough energy targets in a @entity13 directive , 10 per cent of the energy used in the transport sector across the @entity10 will have to come from biofuels or other ' renewable ' energy sources rather than fossil fuel by 2020			1
but campaigners argue that the green initiative will just penalise motorists and taxpayers in @entity4 who are already struggling to keep their head above water in the current economic climate			2
price hike : an @entity10 directive forcing member states to cut down fossil fuel usage could cause add 4p a litre to petrol and diesel @entity30 , of the @entity32 @entity4 campaign , said : ' the absolute priority at the moment is getting petrol and diesel to an affordable level and anything that stops that from happening should be resisted			1
' many of our supporters have the environment at heart but before we can concentrate and invest in more environmentally friendly forms of transport , such as electric cars and better public transport , we need a secure economy that is stable and growing			2
campaigning : @entity30 , of @entity32 @entity4 , is calling for fuel duty to be cut ' environmentalists do themselves a lot of harm by beating motorists with a stick on price			1
all this does is harm the hardworking individual without bringing in any realistic form of long - term change			0
' how does this help the nurse who needs to dig in to her own pocket to pay for petrol to visit patients in rural areas because her fuel allowance wo n't cover the cost of the journeys ? it 's very naive			2
' he added that as well as campaigning against the @entity10 directive , @entity32 @entity4 is also calling for the government to scrap the planned 3p price hike in august			0
mr @entity30 argued that the level of duty on fuel in the @entity4 should be brought down to the significantly lower level of other @entity1 countries - around 26 per cent - before any further costs are landed on motorists			2
he added : ' adding 3p per litre when the economy is on its knees , families are struggling to survive week by week and @entity4 businesses are struggling borders on economic madness			0
' a cut of just 2.5p per litre would boost growth by a much needed 0.33 per cent , create 175,000 jobs and crucially not harm @entity90 revenues â€“ the tax take on the stimulated economic growth compensates for the loss of @entity95			1
' biofuels come from a range of sources including plants , fermented organic matter , bacteria and bio waste and it is considered to be the most viable way of cutting down greenhouse gas emissions			0
but the process is also very costly			0
a @entity13 directive in 2003 first insisted that 5.75 per cent of the energy used in the transport sector across the 27 @entity10 member states should be ' green ' by 2010 but it then increased the target again in 2009 to 10 per cent by 2020			1
@entity10 officials hope the tough targets will reduce dependency on oil - based fuels and help encourage an increased use of more environmentally friendly fuels			0
hard hit : critics argue it is average hardworking people who will be hit by the price hikes but critics still argue now is not the time to be putting more pressure on @entity10 member states that are trying to revive their economies			0
the move was described as ' insanity ' by a leading campaigner for cheaper fuel @entity130 mp @entity129			1
he told the @entity133 : ' this is insanity			0
this stupid directive would force the @entity90 to put another 3 or 4p on a litre			1
' the government is trying to keep fuel duty down , but now we have these @entity1 bureaucrats meddling to force up the price			1
frankly , the government should tell them where to go			0
' how can we get our economy moving again when @entity13 keeps inventing new taxes to destroy growth and jobs ? '			0

10 per cent of transport energy must be ' green ' by 2020
@entity130 mp @entity129 warns @entity90 would need to raise fuel duty by up to 4p a litre to meet target
