few managers can appreciate the loss of @entity2 and @entity3 to @entity4 better than @entity6 manager @entity5			1
while the two @entity4 strikers were tearing up the @entity10 with 52 goals between them last season , @entity7 and @entity8 were firing @entity6 to promotion from the @entity14 with a combined total of 40 @entity10 goals			1
@entity7 has not played this season due to a serious knee injury , though the @entity19 international could finally return to the squad to face @entity4 at @entity21			1
@entity7 poses @entity8 has netted four times in 15 @entity10 games this season as @entity6 battle to beat the drop @entity8 was also missing for more than a month with a hamstring problem , and @entity5 can fully understand why @entity28 ’ side have suffered without their two main strikers			1
‘ with all due respect , @entity7 and @entity8 are still learning to be @entity2 and @entity3 - type players , ’ said @entity5			2
‘ so if we ’re missing them , it ’s fair to say that @entity28 will miss two players like that from his side			0
@entity5 and @entity8 celebrate after beating @entity38 on the way to promotion to the @entity10 @entity2 ( left ) left for @entity41 and @entity42 has only played three times for @entity4 this season ‘ @entity4 without @entity2 and @entity3 look a different unit			1
still a good unit , but are they as good ? the question remains			0
‘ strikers make a difference			0
that ’s why they all drive massive cars , that ’s why there is a shortage of them , that ’s why the world demands “ can we find a striker ? ” — because it changes the whole view of the team			0
‘ rarely did your dad speak to you about the right back			0
i remember mine talking to me about @entity63 and other @entity4 strikers			2
they make a massive difference to the way a team looks			0
