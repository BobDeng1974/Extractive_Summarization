it might seem like an impossible dream but a healthy , slender figure like @entity3 's can be yours without embarking on a fad diet , feeling guilty about food or spending hours pumping iron at the gym			1
that 's what nutritionist - to - the - stars @entity16 , whose world famous @entity19 diet has picked up a host of celebrity fans from @entity23 to @entity24 , @entity25 and , of course , @entity27 herself , says			1
scroll down for exclusive video @entity3 used the @entity19 plan to get into shape for the @entity33 film transformers : @entity34 @entity16 has just updated and rereleased his @entity19 plan for @entity36 this month which promises to cut the binge - regret - diet - bingle cycle endured by dieters and give you a lean and lucious shape without bulking up or shrinking down			1
the revised and updated @entity19 plan can be downloaded onto kindles or iphones and @entity45 using the @entity36 app. and even better for readers of @entity48 , @entity16 has filmed a series of exclusive exercise videos , each targeting a specific problem area , just for us			1
this week , bottoms are getting the star treatment			1
watch in the weeks to come for other exclusive videos showing just how to improve your legs , tummy and arms			1
@entity3 is more than happy to show off the results of the @entity19 plan in today 's video , @entity16 reveals three exercises which he promises will give you a ' perfect perky butt '			1
the hip extension exercise will ' switch your butt on ' by engaging the glutes , while the lying side leg raises give a ' incredibly effective exercise for working your butt without bulking up ' he promises			1
the final one , the mini band walking , is so effective he says that he trained an actress for a @entity33 action movie and ' after a month of doing this exercise her butt had lifted so much that they has to change her costume '			1
in his book , @entity83 , @entity16 also recommends a whole range of butt - boosting exercises including squats , lunges , and jumps			1
@entity3 met @entity16 several years ago and is such a fan that she penned the introduction to his book @entity19 : @entity92			1
said @entity3 : ' @entity16 knows exactly how i want my body to look : lean , taut and strong , yet soft , curvy and feminine			1
' what i 've learnt through working with @entity16 is that by focussing on creating a healthy body you can really achieve all of these things , faster than i ever thought possible			1
oh and by the way , nobody can get a stomach as flat as @entity16 can ! ' although it 's loved by supermodels , @entity103 girls and film stars , @entity16 says that the real magic is that is can work for anyone , from housewives to office workers and everyone in between			1
common sense : @entity16 's @entity19 plan is loved by supermodels and anyone who wants to detox and tone up the diet has never been advertised , but those who follow it ( and who follow @entity16 's workouts , which he teaches from his @entity123 gym @entity124 , recently voted as best in the business by @entity126 ) become enthusiastic to the point of fanaticism , making the @entity19 plan popular through word of mouth alone			1
it recommends fresh food , as close to its natural state as possible			2
no refined sugar , which @entity16 describes as like a ' toxic fat bomb ' for your waistline			1
cut back caffeine to one cup of coffee in the morning			2
rely on natural , nutritious foods to give you energy rather than a rollercoaster of unnatural highs provided by sugar and caffeine that invariably end in a crash that will have you reaching for the next stimulant , whether that be coffee , carbs , sweets or wine			2
and yes , ditch the booze			2
fans : @entity156 , supermodel @entity3 has been following the @entity19 plan for some years now , while right , @entity158 model @entity24 is also a fan in his new book , @entity16 explains that he came up with the term ' clean and lean ' to describe the ' ultimate approach to achieving the perfect body			1
the word ' clean ' here means a body that can deal effectively with toxins - one that can deal with few that sneak in ( via a glass of wine or a chocolate bar ) and flush them out successfully			2
' in his years of studying nutrition , says @entity16 , he has discovered that while you can live off processed low - fat food and diet colas for a while your body will be so toxic that you 'll find it hard to keep the weight off			1
' people come to me who have tried every single diet out there , yet they ca n't stay slim for long			2
they cut carbs , they count calories , they ban whole food groups and they spend their lives weighing and measuring out food , ' he says			2
' but this type of dieting is a complete waste of time : it might help you to drop a dress size or tighten your belt for a while , but you 'll gain it back eventually because your body will still be toxic and it 's unsustainable - who wants to live like this ? and so the cycle of dieting , feeling miserable and deprived , losing and gaining weight continues			2
' instead , @entity16 says we should enjoy our food , but make sure that rather than processed foods , we eat healthy , natural foods and avoid ones laden with sugar			1

or for @entity212 readers at $ 9.56 on @entity213 clean foods are those that : @entity16 says : ' @entity216 is designed to hook us in			1
it comes in the forms of pretty pink cupcakes , fluffy marshmallows , light sponge cakes with jam in the middle and creamy chocolate			2
it looks and smells delicious			2
but in reality , there 's almost nothing to love about refined sugar			0
it makes us put on weight , increases the size of our liver ( a bad thing ) , makes us unwell and ages us inside and out , leaving us tired , fat and wrinkled			0
' as well as being highly addictive , refined sugar drags valuable nutrients out of our body , and it 's the number one reason why , for the first time in history , children of this generation are predicted to die younger than their parents			0
why @entity216 is physically addictive @entity216 has a similar effect on the brain to pain - killing drugs like morphine and opther opiates ( such as heroin )			0
these drugs produce an almost instant feeling of pleasure , calm and satisfaction , making them incredibly addictive			0
when the food manufacturers figured this out , they began producing foods full of sugar			0
back in the 1950s , sugar would mainly be found in homemade cakes , but now it 's pumped into almost all of the processed foods , alcoholic and soft drinks and even so - called ' healthy foods ' ( such as breakfast cereals ) and foods aimed at children			0
many of us turn to something sugary for ' energy ' - and technically , it is a form of energy			0
but it 's a bad type			0
so yes , you will get a qcuik burst after eating a chocolate bar , but about ten minutes after that you 'll feel even more tired than you were before			0
that 's because sugar quickly hits the bloodstream , creating a rapid rise in blood sugar ( a ' spike ' )			0
but , just as quickly , you then crash ( due to insulin being produced from the pancreas ) , leaving you exhausted			0
a far better way of getting energy is to eat complex carbohydrates ( low - @entity294 fruits , berries ) , clean & lean proteins , vegetables , drink plenty of water and exercise regularly			1
if you do all these things , you wo n't need to rely on something as toxic as sugar to keep you energised			0
why @entity216 is emotionally addictive for most of us , when we were growing up , sugary foods were used as a ' reward ' by our parents , grandparents and almost everybody else we knew as children			0
is it any wonder that by the time we reached our teens we 'd learnt to associate sugary foods with happy times and making ourselves feel better ? serves 4 ingredients 2 tomatoes , halved 1 broccoli , cut into florets 4 fresh organic eggs @entity321 , for sprinkling rocket , to serve method 1			0
heat the grill to high and place the tomatoes under it for a few minutes until coloured			0
while the tomatoes are cooking , steam the broccoli for 3 - 4 minutes under just tender , then set aside			0
meanwhile , bring a pan of water to the boil			0
stir the water rapidly to create a whirlpool and crack the first egg into the centre ; the swirling water should bring the egg together			0
repeat with the remaining eggs ( 3 - 4 minutes is sufficient cooking time )			0
serve each egg with the broccoli and grilled tomato			0
grate a little @entity321 over the top , and scatter rocket over the plate .			0
