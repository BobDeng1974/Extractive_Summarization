@entity0 came from gorillas as well as chimpanzees , new research suggests			0
two of the four known groups of viruses that cause the disease have been traced back to the great apes that share about 98 per cent of their dna with humans			2
it had been known simian immunodeficiency virus ( @entity14 ) - the monkey equivalent of @entity16 - had jumped from chimpanzees into humans , but now it seems gorillas in @entity19 also played a vital role			1
scientists say understanding the disease 's origins will help predict the future risk of an outbreak			0
scientists have discovered that @entity0 may have originated from western lowland gorillas in @entity19 , as well as groups of chimpanzees in the country the connection was uncovered after researchers analysed faecal samples collected in remote forests			1
they found @entity16 - 1 groups known as ' o ' and ' p ' originated in western lowland gorillas			1
@entity16 - 1 - the virus that causes @entity0 - has jumped species to infect humans on at least four separate occasions			1
the other lineages , 'm ' and ' n ' , are known to have started in geographically distinct chimpanzee communities in southern @entity19			2
@entity41 ' gave rise to the @entity44 - infecting over 40 million people worldwide by spreading across @entity45 and throughout the rest of the world			0
scientists found @entity16 - 1 groups known as ' o ' and ' p ' originated in western lowland gorillas			1
a conceptual image of a @entity16 infected cell is pictured @entity51 ' and ' p ' , at the other extreme , have only been found in a few individuals from @entity19			1
but ' o ' - although not as widespread and prevalent as @entity54 ' - has nonetheless infected about 100,000 people in west @entity45			0
the team screened fecal samples from western lowland gorillas , eastern lowland gorillas , and mountain gorillas in @entity19 , @entity61 , the @entity62 , and @entity63 for evidence of @entity14 strains - the pre-cursors of @entity16			1
a new book claims the @entity0 epidemic began in a rainforest in southeastern @entity19 in 1908 and not more than 70 years later when the virus started to be recognized in the early 1980s			2
for the book , which is subtitled ' how @entity0 emerged from an @entity73 forest ' , @entity71 traced the history of @entity0 by examining genetic samples from humans and chimps			0
this led him to believe the birthplace of the epidemic was the southeastern edge of @entity19 sometime around 1908			2
@entity71 theorizes that a hunter in the rainforest was infected with a immunodeficiency virus similar to @entity16 by a chimp he killed and butchered			1
the hunter likely infected at least one other person through sex and the virus continued to make its way down the @entity90 in that matter until it reached the city of @entity93 ( now @entity93 ) in the @entity62			0
after reaching the @entity62 , the virus spread even faster via the continued re-use of hypodermic syringes at health clinics , mr @entity71 said			0
they identified it in four communities of western lowland gorillas in southern @entity19 - and dubbed it ' @entity102 '			1
professor @entity103 , of @entity104 , said : ' viral sequencing revealed a high degree of genetic diversity among the different gorilla samples			0
' two of the gorilla virus lineages were particularly closely related to @entity16 - 1 groups @entity34 and @entity112 told us these two groups originated in western lowland gorillas			1
' dr @entity115 , of @entity116 in @entity117 , said the study has implications for understanding emerging diseases and gauging future human infection risks			0
she added : ' from this study and others our team has conducted in the past it has become clear both chimpanzees and gorillas harbour viruses capable of crossing the species barrier to humans and have the potential to cause major disease outbreaks			2
' the origin of @entity16 has baffled scientists since 1984 when it was first shown it causes @entity0			2
evidence soon pointed to @entity45 and a similar virus in chimpanzees			0
many scientists suspect that the chimp virus jumped into humans who hunt and butcher these great apes			1
but gorillas are now emerging as having played a supporting role in the aids epidemic - possibly by humans hunting them			0
the research was published in the @entity148 .			0

scientists identified pre-cursor of *hiv* virus in gorillas in @entity19
@entity155 similar to two @entity16 strains known as ' o ' and ' p ' found in the gorillas
*previously* scientists had only identified the virus in chimpanzee groups
*experts* believe the monkey virus jumped into humans who hunted them
