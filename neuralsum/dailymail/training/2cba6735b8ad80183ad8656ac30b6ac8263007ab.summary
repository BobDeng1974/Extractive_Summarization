the sex secrets of @entity2 men reveal them to be a collection of neurotic , insecure , unfeeling perverts , too scared to commit to a relationship with someone they care for			1
according to @entity9 sex therapist dr. @entity8 , who has listened to the psychological issues of the men - folk of @entity2 for seven - years , serial cheating , porn addiction and soliciting prostitutes are all symptoms of an inability to settle down in the big smoke			1
from successful bank executives who pay for prostitutes , to @entity23 dungeon loving hedge fund chiefs and even men convinced that ' good guys finish last ' , @entity8 has listened to them all betray their sordid secrets - while charging them $ 150 an hour for the privilege			1
dr. @entity8 has spent seven years working out of her @entity27 offices in @entity2 examining the sexual problems of the men of the city indeed , @entity8 has conducted so many sessions out of her @entity27 offices examining ailments such as sex addiction , erectile dysfunction , sexual anxiety , chronic womanizing , jealousy and porn addiction , that she has compiled them into a book called ' @entity40 '			1
' there were times i felt repugnance , ' @entity8 admitted to the @entity45			1
' sometimes i had to work hard to hide my instinctual reactions			2
' originally opening her practice to counsel women , @entity8 says she was stunned that her most interesting clients were men			1
' @entity51 and handsome men — accomplished in almost every way — are coming to me nervous about being around women , ' she said			2
' they desire to please us , to perform for us , but have deep fears about what we really think about them			2
i was surprised at how many of my male clients were anxious to the point of dysfunction over their desire to satisfy a woman			0
' the therapist outlines different cases in point , with names changed to protect their anonymity			1
dr. @entity8 found that successful men often found themselves seeking no - strings attach sex with prostitutes as a way of coping with their insecurities @entity77 , a successful engineer was jilted by his fiancée on their wedding day and years later he makes his girlfriend play - act that she is two - timing him as the only way he can become sexually excited			1
' tell me how you 're going to do it ! ' he commands			0
' in the bathroom - while you 're in the next room , ' replies his confused girlfriend , half - heartedly			0
@entity8 recounts how @entity77 ' current relationship became so weird that the girlfriend began cheating on him for real and eventually left him			1
another striking example of the insecurities of men in @entity2 who came to @entity8 for help was @entity97 , a bank executive in his early 40s who was deeply in love with his confident new wife			1
however , according to @entity8 , @entity97 could not perform in the bedroom , telling her , ' i 'm having trouble keeping it up			1
so i 'm having sex with prostitutes			2
i 'll give you five sessions to fix this			0
' together the pair analyzed his problems and realized that he was a ' blustery alpha male ' who wanted sex without any expectation , or as he put it , sex with ' non-beings '			2
@entity8 told the @entity45 that erectile dysfunction was ' the most common complaint ' that she 'd heard			1
and ' many of the men who were visiting massage parlors did have some sort of sexual dysfunction ... with the women that they were actually interested in			1
' they got performance anxiety when it was someone whom they cared about pleasuring , or would judge them for it			0
dr. @entity8 conducted therapy with men who were only committed to the chase of gaining some women 's telephone numbers - with no desire to call them so sending @entity97 back to his wife , @entity8 tried to get him to treat his wife in a caring and compassionate manner - but his wife rebuked his efforts and he stopped attending therapy			1
' in the end , it was @entity97 who had become the ' non-being '			0
another type of @entity2 man was @entity149 , whom @entity8 dubbed ' the @entity150			1
' he was a successful hedge - fund manager , who lived in @entity152 and had bagged himself a model girlfriend			0
' my girlfriend is absolutely gorgeous , ' he bragged according to the @entity45			0
' she ’s tall and blond , a model with a perfect rack and rock - hard abs. ' however , this was n't enough for him and all he would do would spend time in clubs trying to get telephone numbers from available women - and most of the time would never call them back			0
' it ’s exciting , like winning a game , ' he boasted to @entity8			1
' there ’s a process to it , and i ’m known for being the best			0
' the old axiom that ' nice guys finish last ' rang true on a number of occasions for dr. @entity8 during her dealings with her disaffected male clients @entity8 says that she established with @entity183 that he was a show - off , a narcissist for whom ' everything is measured by how the outside world sees him			1
' eventually after therapy , @entity149 discovered his girlfriend was cheating on him and he ended it with her , moved to @entity193 and started learning to play the guitar			0
' what i learned from @entity149 is that when men cheat , it ’s often psychological , not physical , ' @entity8 said			1
' a man can be with the sexiest , most beautiful woman on @entity201 , but it will still not be enough			0
' of course there is the flip side to all this promiscuity , with the ' nice guy ' who was in a relationship where his girlfriend did not find him interesting anymore			0
@entity8 said that she had one couple , @entity209 and @entity210 , who came to her because the sex had become monotonous			1
' i ’ve seen so many examples like this			0
@entity210 is the quintessential nice guy			0
he does n’t know how to keep himself and his woman sexualized , ' @entity8 said			1
' i saw this all the time with my male clients : they learn some skills , but they do n’t have the chutzpah — self - possession and courage — to pull it off			0
' dr. @entity224 also discovered that when men were married to women more secure and confident than them that they often strayed because of their own insecurities on the other side of the scale is @entity231 , a building contractor who openly admitted during a group therapy session that he was cheating on his wife with a younger woman			1
' she 'll do anything sexually , ' he boasted to the group			0
@entity8 told the @entity45 that at first she would find it difficult to sympathize with a serial cheater until she could discover the reasons			2
@entity231 told her that he felt impotent in his relationship and that his wife was smarter and her family richer than his			0
' my wife makes all the decisions around the house			0
i know it ’s because i ’m never home , but i feel useless when i ’m there			0
i ’m just a paycheck to her			0
' i feel like she does n’t appreciate anything , ' he told @entity8			2
' the number one complaint from men about women in long - term relationships is , ‘ i do n’t feel appreciated , ’ @entity8 told @entity264			1
' men are looking for some expression that they are valued			2
' no less destructive was the prevalence of pornography addiction among the men of @entity2 the darker side of @entity2 male sexuality is expressed by the so - called ' nice guys ' , trusted by women , but who hide the most dirty of secret sex lives			1
@entity8 discusses @entity276 , who would have been seen as an enlightened soul , whose mother was a feminist			2
the professor would complete a days work and then excitedly return home to download porn , especially degrading pornography			0
as is usually the case , the porn stars he idolized were nothing like his girlfriend , who he called ' a porcelain doll ' and whose lovemaking he felt was ' routine and vanilla			0
' @entity8 has noted an increase in the number of men coming to her to examine their addiction to porn and she has some insight			1
' i ’m seeing this in a lot of men i treat , ' @entity8 said			1
other men had to attend @entity23 clubs where they would pay to hire women to ' torture ' within the boundaries of the sexual play ' they feel like they ca n’t be their authentic selves around the women that they are in love with			2
but guys who feel this way will find outlets somewhere			0
' in this case however , @entity276 's girlfriend was willing to come to therapy sessions where they were encouraged to discuss his more base sexual desires and now has ' much less interest in his nightly porn habit			2
' as an offshoot of soliciting prostitutes , one patient of @entity325 , @entity323 had developed a secret love and desire to visit @entity23 clubs where he would pay for prostitutes and ' torture ' them			0
' he feels dominated , powerless and trapped by the women in his life , and he is full of rage about it , ' @entity8 says			2
' so it busts out in his very compartmentalized sex life			2
' however , for @entity8 , despite @entity323 's apparently well adjusted life , she says he taught her something about the ' good guys ' of @entity2			1
' there ’s something wrong with their ability to be real and authentic			0
and they ’re going to find a way to deal with their frustration elsewhere			0
