by @entity0 it ’s often said that mothers share a special maternal bond with their child that is unmatched by others , including the father , despite his paternal role			1
but a study says that men can actually have just as strong a bond with their child , especially in the absence of the mother			2
and it could force a re-think on the role dads can play in the development of children			1
a study by a researcher at @entity21 says that men can take on the role of being a mother ( stock image shown )			1
dr @entity26 says that when a mother is absent , perhaps through divorce , the father assumes the role			1
this is in addition to playing the role of father as well - they can do both the research titled ‘ flexibility of the father ’s brain ’ was published in the @entity41			1
‘ shifts in society and culture have led to increases in men ’s involvement in the care of infants , ’ writes researcher dr @entity26 of @entity21			1
many adults will admit to telling white lies to children to make their lives a little easier			0
but research has found children can spot this tactic , and can even tell when their parents or teachers are deliberately withholding information from them			0
once spotted , a study from the @entity62 found children will then try to fill in the gaps in the information themselves			0
determining who to trust is an important skill to learn at an early age because so much of our knowledge about the world comes from other people , explained @entity73 , lead author of the paper which was published in the journal @entity76			0
‘ when someone provides us information , we not only learn about what is being taught , we also learn something about that person , ' she said			0
' if the information is accurate and complete , then you might also trust that person in the future			0
' ‘ the modern - day family comes in a variety of structures , and more and more people are playing unconventional roles in childrearing			2
’ in the study , reports @entity94 , the brains of parents were scanned while they watched videos of their interactions with children			0
two systems of the brain were stimulated during this activity : the emotional network and mental processing			0
fathers who said they were secondary to the mother in providing care for the child were found to have less of an emotional response than their partner			0
but those who were raising a child by themselves were found to have a similar emotional response to mothers while retaining the critical thinking of secondary fathers			0
this meant they were performing both roles of mother and father			2
the finding could be important for cases of divorce , where battles over custody are often ruled in the mother ’s favour			2
and the study could bring into question the role men can play in a child ’s upbringing			1
when a mother is present the father 's brain is less active emotionally , but they retain a level of critical thinking that makes them paternal			1
in the absence of a mother dads take on the role of both parents			2
the research could be important for the role dads can play in kids ' upbringing ( stock image shown )			1
