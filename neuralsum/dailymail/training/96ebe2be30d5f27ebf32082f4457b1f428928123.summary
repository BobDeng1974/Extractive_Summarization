antibacterial soap is pointless because most people do not use it correctly , a researcher has claimed			2
the increasingly popular product has little or no benefit for most people because they do not wash their hands for long enough			0
dr @entity8 , from the @entity9 , at @entity10 , says the soaps are beneficial in hospitals where people know how to use them , but that they are pointless in the home			2
as a result , he says antibacterial soaps will be no more effective than other soaps , @entity24 reports			0
dr @entity8 adds that miicrobes can also adapt to antibacterial ingredients in the soaps , meaning they become resistant to them			1
he believes this could even increase their resistance to antibiotics which could make it more difficult for doctors to treat infections			1
dr @entity8 has also warned that there is some evidence to suggest the chemicals in antibacterial soaps can affect our hormone levels			1
during the last 20 years , the number of products containing triclosan and triclocarban – antimicrobial chemicals – has soared			0
dr @entity8 says the soaps are effective in hospitals where staff know they have to wash their hands for between 20 and 30 seconds to kill bacteria effectively as a result , some three - quarters of people in the @entity55 now have the substances in their urine			1
the @entity59 has now started the process of regulating the use of antibacterial products			0
it says they will have to be taken out of all products unless the manufacturers can prove they are both effective and safe for human use			0
‘ the @entity59 's move is a prudent and important step toward preserving the efficacy of clinically important antibiotics , preventing unnecessary exposure of the general population to endocrine disrupting and potentially harmful chemicals , and throttling back the increasing release and accumulation of antimicrobials in the environment , ’ dr @entity8 told @entity24 .			2

people do not wash their hands for long enough for the soap to work
they would need to wash their hands for 20 to 30 seconds
most only wash hands for an average of six seconds , says dr @entity8
bacteria could also become resistant to the antibacterial chemicals
this could make it more difficult to treat infections with antibiotics
