by @entity1 reporter published : 03:26 est , 29 august 2013 updated : 03:26 est , 29 august 2013 @entity3 stallion : @entity4 was n't quite as shy about the size of his manhood judging by this restored @entity3 statue - but an increasing number of @entity3 men are opting to undergo penis enlargement surgery , according to a doctor they are known for their @entity15 ways , with the mere thought of being swept of their feet by an @entity3 stallion making many @entity22 women go weak at the knees			2
but it seems that @entity3 men are not quite as confident as you might think			2
a top @entity3 plastic surgeon has claimed that ' changing room syndrome ' is causing a surge in the number of men opting to undergo penis enlargement surgery			1
dr @entity32 , director of the @entity33 in @entity34 , has revealed that the number of surgical procedures to boost men 's manhood is on the rise by as much as 25 per cent every year in the @entity41 country			1
despite the operation costing between £ 2,500 and £ 6,000 , the centre , which specialises in penis enlargement , carried out 300 procedures in the past year			0
the high cost of the operation - formally known as penoplasty - means that it is mainly men aged between 30 and 50 who are opting to go under the knife , as they are most likely to be able to afford it			2
according to dr @entity32 , patients usually request that their penis is made thicker , with some wanting it longer and others wanting both			1
dr @entity32 told @entity60 that most men do n't want surgery to satisfy their partners - many are married - but instead puts the surge down to what he calls ' changing room syndrome '			1
he says that many men are merely trying to keep up with their peers			1
he said : ' with everyone seeing images of the body the whole time these days , men are more aware and worried about their bodies - all the parts are important and the genitals are no exception			1
' we 're living in the age of images , with sexual ones very often on the front page , ' he told @entity83 news agency			0
' so sex gets more attention and people feel the need to be more competitive			2
' but the surgeon added that many men have no need to stress over the size of their manhood and he often has to turn people away			1
he said that some have unrealistic expectations while others show signs of psychological damage			1
risky : the procedure does have its risks however - a 2011 study found an ' unacceptably high ' rate of complications in penoplasty operations the idea that @entity3 men might not be so confident in the trouser department will come as a surprise given that even former prime minister @entity109 has something of a reputation as a lothario , with his sexual exploits previously landing him in hot water			0
but the decision of many to opt for surgery is not only a drastic one in terms of finances , the procedure is certainly not without its risks - a study by the @entity122 in 2011 found that the operation had an ' unacceptably high ' rate of complications			0
compared to their counterparts from other @entity129 countries however , it seems that @entity3 men have little to worry about			0
according to a 2012 survey by @entity131 , emeritus professor of psychology at @entity133 , of international penis size @entity3 men are better endowed than chaps from @entity136 , the @entity22 , @entity137 and @entity138			0
the research claimed that the @entity3 average was 6.2 inches when erect compared to a @entity22 average of 5.5			0
the only @entity129 country to top @entity3 in the table was @entity142 with an average of 6.5 inches			0
men from the @entity147 had the biggest penises , with an average of 7.1 inches .			0

dr @entity32 *blames* ' changing room syndrome ' for the increase
he claims men are more worried about keeping up with peers than sex
the surgeon says some men just have ' unrealistic expectations '
