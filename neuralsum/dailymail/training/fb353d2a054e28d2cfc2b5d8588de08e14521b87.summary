while it features athletes at the peak of their physical and mental fitness , rather than energy drinks , these athletes will just need a plug socket			2
and before competition has even started , two robots dubbed ' @entity11 ' and ' the @entity12 ' copied the trademark poses of their @entity16 namesakes - as they went in search of their own gold medals			2
the machines are among 200 competitors from all over the world taking part in the @entity25 annual ' @entity16 ' games , called the @entity26			1
@entity28 and @entity12 the robot are part of a team from @entity31 , who have robots competing in football , sprint and marathon events			1

but unlike @entity40 - who has size 13 feet - @entity38 wears size 3k children 's @entity48 trainers			1
meanwhile , @entity12 the robot will be copying his namesake @entity51 as he takes part in the long - distance event , an 84 metre ' marathon ' on saturday			1
the endurance event will truly test the smiling robot to his limit - the outdoor course includes inclines , twists and turns			2
@entity31 is hoping @entity38 and @entity12 will retain their world championship titles			0
robot football research assistant @entity62 said : ' we have the only robots in the world with shoes on			1
' yellow card : @entity31 's humanoid robots take part in a football match at the @entity39			2
it helps to see errors when they put their foot down , it improves their balance , and most importantly , it looks cute			0
' the @entity76 takes place at the @entity79 science centre until saturday			2
it is the first time the @entity81 has ever hosted the annual event , and is fielding two teams - one from @entity31 and the other from @entity85			0
@entity31 's robots at the @entity87 , which kicks off today			1
the international competition includes climbing , weightlifting , football , sprinting and a marathon more than 200 robotics engineers representing 27 teams from across the world are competing in events including weightlifting , basketball and climbing			1
@entity31 has entered 12 robots , which cost Â£ 4,000 and include state - of - the - art processors and parts made from @entity102 and perspex			0
@entity62 said : ' we try to give them each their own character and personality			0
@entity108 : decked out with children 's size @entity48 trainers , this robot footballer is ready for the world cup to begin ' that 's why they have smiling faces			1
' our robot athletes are happy , and we want the students we help teach to be happy too			2
' but @entity62 , 40 , said : ' we wo n't be seeing these cute humanoid robots in the shop any time soon - they are too dangerous at the moment			0
' where are the sheepskin coats ? students program their team 's tactics into players ahead of a robot football match at the robot world cup he added : ' people connect with them , because there is a natural instinct in our brains to connect with little people			1
