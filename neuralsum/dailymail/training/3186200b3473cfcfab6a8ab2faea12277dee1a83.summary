@entity1 look determined to teach @entity4 's weakened @entity3 side a lesson as they were put through their paces ahead of saturday 's showdown at @entity10			1
the @entity1 won all 14 of their test matches in 2013 , becoming the first team to ever do so , and are looking toward next year 's defence of the @entity14			1
their only loss since that epic win over @entity18 three years ago was to @entity3 in 2012 but , worryingly for @entity19 without a number of frontline players , @entity1 do n't seem keen on suffering a similar fate			1
determined : @entity23 led the way in @entity1 's training session ahead of saturday 's showdown prepared : @entity1 became the first team in the professional era to complete an unbeaten season in 2013 unbeaten : the @entity1 failed to lose last year , winning 14 of their test matches in 2013 paces : @entity32 ( left ) and @entity33 ( right ) are put through their paces and want to extend their run @entity4 expects the players available for the first test to grasp their opportunity and to measure up to ‘ the biggest challenge in world rugby ’			1
that is , playing the @entity1 at home			0
@entity1 coach @entity45 has had just a few selection issues			2
with @entity49 still unavailable on ‘ sabbatical ’ , the choice for fly half came down to the in - form @entity52 or the more seasoned but out - of - form @entity53			0
he opted for the latter , relying on the @entity57 playmaker to find his form under test - match pressure			0
backrower @entity60 - the @entity61 last season - is sidelined with concussion			0
but there is a ready - made replacement at no 8 in 31 - year - old veteran @entity66			0
he will play his first test since the @entity69 final , having spent two years in @entity70 before returning to @entity1 this year			1
lock @entity71 is out with a broken leg and winger @entity73 has a knee injury , but @entity1 have strong back - up to rely on			2
stretch : @entity1 look determined to extend their unbeaten run at @entity10 on saturday bandaged : @entity33 passes the ball during their training session at @entity83 in @entity1 ‘ there 's been a lot of talk in the media about this being a poor @entity3 side , ’ @entity45 said			1
‘ but when you go through them they 've all played internationals in the last 12 months and there are not that many changes from the last time we played them - and that was a great contest			0
‘ they 've clearly got confidence in who they are and what they 're doing			0
their environment seems to be one of just keeping quiet and get on and do the work , and that makes them dangerous			0
’ @entity1 are expected to have an advantage due to the sustained pace at which they play the game , and @entity45 expects @entity3 to counter that with a game based around its forwards and set pieces			2
@entity4 has tried to liberate @entity3 from that dour style but he lacks players with the ability , or even the ambition , to play attractive rugby for long periods			1
he said @entity3 had made the transition from an experienced to a less mature side after the @entity69 , and was now used to playing against more - seasoned opponents , adding ‘ experience is not the only barometer of what wins and loses games			2
’ focused : @entity1 refuse to fall for the ' poor @entity3 side ' front and expect a tough match roar : @entity132 ( right ) pushing himself to the limit with his ' confident ' @entity1 team - mates			1

@entity1 have lost just once since winning the @entity14 three years ago - to @entity3 in 2012
@entity1 won all 14 of their test matches in 2013 , and were the first team in the professional era to do so
face a weakened @entity3 on saturday at @entity10 in first of three tests
