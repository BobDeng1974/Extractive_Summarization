by @entity0 , mail online deputy political editor a growing number of families are moving their elderly parents in with them as overcrowding , house prices and care costs soar , official figures suggest			1
millions of @entity10 are now living in homes with at least five other people amid a shortage of housing as the population booms , the @entity9 has found			1
in total the number of people living in households with six or more occupants has surged by 25 per cent in the last 10 years - with more than three million people now live in a homes with at least five others			1
@entity24 's population is booming - with every region set to grow between 2012 and 2022 experts at the @entity9 said the surge was due to ' economic or cultural factors ' - including young couples living with parents because they can not afford a home			1
but older couples living with their adult children - the new ' sandwich generation ' of @entity10 - has also soared as elderly care costs force couples to look after their aged parents and their children at the same time			1
the growth in crowded homes will also include immigrant workers in more expensive areas of the country such as @entity44			1
every region of @entity24 and @entity47 , apart from the north east , saw a rise in the the proportion of households with six or more occupants over the 10 year period			1
in @entity54 , @entity44 , 10 per cent of properties are home to six or more people			1
outside the capital , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60 were the areas with the highest proportion of ' six or more '			0
the unprecedented strain on housing supply was laid bare last night by figures showing the country ’s booming population			1
@entity24 will have to find room for 3.8million extra people over the next eight years at a time when house prices and rents are already spiralling			1
in the most overcrowded part of the country , @entity77 , more than 2.5 million more people will be crammed in by 2022 , according to the breakdown from the @entity9			2
this will require an estimated million new homes to be built in the already overcrowded @entity81			1
the increase will also bring new pressure on transport , education , health , water and energy services			0
the @entity90 and the @entity91 will have to find homes and services for 1.3million , the report said			0
immigration is the major driving force behind the population increase , and is now having a bearing on housing across the southern half of @entity24			1
the report will make grim reading at a time when home ownership has become unaffordable for many families			0
@entity105 prices are rising faster than at any time since 2007			0
a shortage of homes means the value of a typical property in @entity24 and @entity47 has risen 6.1 per cent in a year , to £ 161,900			2
in @entity44 , prices have risen by 17 per cent			2
yesterday @entity112 praised the government ’s help to @entity115 for assisting 7,313 property purchases in its first few months , the vast majority outside the capital			0
the prime minister said : ‘ as @entity119 , home ownership is in our blood – it ’s about aspiration , planning for the future and laying down roots			0
’ @entity24 's population is expected to boom in the next decade - with @entity44 , the @entity125 and parts of the @entity127 ( coloured in dark purple ) set to grow more quickly than elsewhere despite a booming population and growing demand for homes the number of people living in each household has plummeted over the last 100 years the housing crisis is being made more acute by the growing number of homes being left empty			1
the @entity9 revealed today that more than a million homes are now unoccupied but the number of people helped by the scheme pales in comparison to the millions who will require homes in the next decade			1
since 2000 , the number of families , couples and individuals needing homes in @entity77 and @entity47 has gone up by 1.7million			2
this figure is far ahead of the rate at which new homes are being built			0
according to the @entity9 , the population will rise by a million in @entity44 alone by 2022 , with another 1.5million adding to the squeeze in the rest of the southern half of the country			1
it will mean intensifying demand for homes at a time when property prices are booming and millions are struggling to get on the housing ladder			2
the @entity9 population estimates were released following a week of deep controversy over the political and economic impact of immigration , with @entity170 scoring successes in local and @entity172 elections			2
it is driving about two thirds of @entity119 ’s population increase and is believed to be directly responsible for more than a third of the demand for new homes			2
the new breakdown analyses where the 3.8million more people expected to be living in @entity24 by 2022 will settle			1
it suggests that the population of @entity44 will go up by 13 per cent to just under 9.4 million over the decade from 2012 to 2022 , while there will be increases of 8.6 per cent in the @entity125 , 7.8 per cent in the @entity125 , and 6.9 per cent in the @entity186			1
soaring house prices have pushed more and more people into rented accommodation , the @entity9 has found			2
almost one in five homes is now rented out as more than a million homes lie empty , people are squeezing themselves into properties			1
the number of homes with six or more people in them has soared by 25 per cent in 10 years however population pressure will also affect the northern half of @entity24			1
there will be a 3.6 per cent rise by 2022 in the @entity202 and 2.9 per cent in the @entity203 , adding some 350,000 to the numbers living across both regions			0
although @entity44 ’s population is rising overall , thousands of families are fleeing the capital in search of better schools , transport and lifestyles , and lower crime			2
their arrival is further pushing up demand for housing and services , on top of the impact of immigration			0
rural and suburban areas are also feeling the impact of the @entity224 push for new housing on a large scale on green field sites			0
residents are invariably anxious to keep these as pristine countryside			0
government housebuilding planners say at least 200,000 homes a year are needed			0
a third of these are necessary to meet the demands of immigration			0
but last year , despite a 28 per cent increase , fewer than 135,000 were built			0
sir @entity237 of the @entity238 think tank said : ‘ this is the chickens coming home to roost			0
‘ the effects of mass immigration are being clearly seen in housing.the chattering classes are still in denial , ignoring the fact that immigration accounts for over a third of new household formation			0
’ former @entity251 chancellor lord @entity250 today hit back at @entity252 claims that immigration was good for the economy			1
he said it was obvious that the size of the economy would grow if there were more people in the country - but that did not mean people would be better off as a result			2
the @entity251 peer said ' most of any benefit goes to immigrants themselves '			1
writing in the @entity267 , he wrote : ' in judging the pros and cons of immigration what matters is not as they argue gdp but gdp per head			0
' immigration may enlarge the economy by having more people but that does not benefit the existing population unless it increases living standards per head			2
' his remarks came after @entity284 and @entity285 , the former @entity252 cabinet ministers , urged the government not to crack down on immigration			0
lord @entity250 said : ' immigrants between 1995 and 2011 cost the exchequer £ 95 billion			0
' @entity284 and @entity285 argue that migrants are a “ bulwark against an ageing population ” , but as our report pointed out immigrants also grow old and trying to deal with that phenomenon through yet further immigration would require ever escalating levels of immigration			2
' he added : ' what can not be denied is the massive impact of immigration on the size of our population			0
if we allow it to continue at the average of the past ten years we will add ten million to the @entity119 population in the next 20 years with at least 60 per cent of the increase due to immigration			1
' @entity250 said ' practically nobody wants to see this '			0
the @entity251 peer said dismissing ' genuine and justified concerns ' was ' simply to play into the hands of extremists '			1
he added : ' it is not a more stringent immigration policy which would have “ serious consequences for the wellbeing of our economy and society ” , as they claim			0
' on the contrary , it is failure to respond to the clear and consistent wishes of three quarters of our population that would indeed have such consequences			0

@entity24 's population set to grow by more than four million in 10 years
@entity44 expected to near *10m* mark by 2022 - with extra 2.5m in @entity81
number of retired people will increase by a fifth putting strain on @entity341
population boom will increase housing crisis as millions forced to rent
one in five homes now rented out - a 50 *%* rise in a decade
three millions @entity10 now live in homes with at least five others
couples forced to look after parents and children to cope with costs
but more than a million homes now lying empty
@entity251 peer @entity250 says immigration costs @entity361 billions
