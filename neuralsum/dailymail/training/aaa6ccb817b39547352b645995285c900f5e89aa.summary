@entity1 's @entity0 released a video last week designed to show off a smaller , lighter version of its robotic dog called @entity6			1
but the video received an unexpected backlash after people began complaining that the ' dog ' in the clip had been mistreated			1
during the footage , employees are seen kicking @entity6 to prove how stable the machine is on its feet , but this has been dubbed ' cruel ' , ' wrong ' and has even raised concerns about robotic ethics			1

it was built by @entity1 - owned @entity0 and is the ' little brother ' of the firm 's larger @entity35 , or ' big dog '			1
@entity0 has not revealed what spot will be used for , but its video showed the robot - animal climbing up and down hills , walking through offices and , of course , being kicked repeatedly			1
following the video 's release , viewers posted their concerns on @entity48			1
one user wrote : ' kicking a dog , even a robot dog seems wrong			1
' another said : ' just wrong , kick a robot dog as practice : @entity1 's dog robot looks too real for comfort when getting kicked			1
' a third added : ' when i first saw [ the ] @entity0 video i was very disturbed regarding dog - kicking			1

he kicked that dog ! ' to prove this point , @entity85 filmed reactions to the video in which many viewers said they were shocked and surprised			1

in a recent paper by dr @entity121 from the @entity122 at @entity123 , he posed the question : ' in the future it 's possible we will be able to create artificially human brains that emulate a real human - but what are the ethicalities and moralities of doing this ?			1

' but while it 's far better to kick a four - legged robot than a real dog , most reasonable people find even the idea of such violence inappropriate , as the comments show			1
' @entity176 from the @entity177 , @entity178 , added : ' the only way it 's unethical is if the robot could feel pain			2
' this is not the first time @entity0 has used to tactic to demonstrate its machines ' balancing skills			2
in 2008 , it released a similar video for its @entity189 in which the larger model was also kicked by employees			1
it was also filmed walking through snow and shows how the robot can correct its stance when walking on ice			2
@entity6 and @entity189 are an electrically powered and hydraulically actuated robots that walk , trot and climb steps			1
a sensor on the robots ' head helps it navigate over rough terrain - and to spot when humans , or another robo - dog is nearby by , allowing it to follow its owner and run in formation			1
during the video , the robot is also shown ' going for a walk ' with its ' big brother '			1
last year , a mathematician said robots will never have feelings because computers ca n't handle any process that completely integrates information , so they can not be conscious and capable of feeling			0
professor @entity220 of the @entity221 in @entity222 said that consciousness can not be created in a physical machine in finite time using limited memory			0
using a mathematical framework for consciousness , developed over the last decade by @entity228 at the @entity229 , professor @entity220 concluded that the ability to integrate information is a key feature of consciousness			0
he believes that integrated information ca n't be broken down into smaller components in conscious minds , because the brain contextualises information			0
for example , when we see a red triangle our brains do n't register the shape as a colourless triangle plus a shapeless coloured area			0
instead we see it as a whole - a red triangle , we understand the ' wider picture '			2

professor @entity220 of the @entity221 in @entity222 added that consciousness can not be created in a physical machine in finite time using limited memory			0
‘ it does n't necessarily mean there is some magic going on in the brain that involves some forces that ca n't be explained physically			0
it is just so complex that it 's beyond our abilities to reverse it and decompose it , ’ he said			2
his research may mean that while humans may not find love with a robot , they are unlikely to be made their slaves either			0

@entity0 released the video of its ' @entity6 ' robotic dog last week
the four - legged , 160lb ( 73kg ) robo - pet can run , climb stairs and jog
it can also correct its balance on uneven terrain , and when kicked
during the clip , employees are seen kicking @entity6 to prove its *stability*
but this has since been dubbed ' cruel ' , ' wrong ' and potentially unethical
spot was built by @entity1 - owned @entity0 and is the ' little brother ' of the firm 's larger *military* version known as @entity332 , or ' big dog '
