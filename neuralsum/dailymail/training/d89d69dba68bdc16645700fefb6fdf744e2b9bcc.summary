@entity1 host @entity2 at @entity3 on tuesday night , with @entity5 's side looking for their sixth straight win			1
@entity1 , meanwhile , are undefeated in their last three games and full of confidence after their win against the @entity12			1
here , @entity14 's @entity13 introduces @entity16 's expected starting xi for the clash			1
@entity18 age : 31 caps : 40 the former @entity22 goalkeeper was out of the game completely for two years , beset by injury and dogged by talk he ’d never return			1
after training with @entity26 last summer , he signed for @entity27 — and now wins his 41st cap four years after his 40th			1
@entity18 has not played for @entity1 for four years , but will start against @entity2 on tuesday @entity30 age : 30 caps : 27 the @entity33 full back is likely to start on the right but can play on the left			1
he loves a mazy dash into opposition territory			0
@entity39 age : 28 caps : 15 born in @entity42 to a @entity44 dad , the @entity33 defender has a doggedness that helps him stick to strikers who should really be out of his league			0
@entity33 defenders @entity30 ( left ) and @entity39 ( right ) will line - up at @entity3 i played @entity1 three times in my career and the games were always fast , furious and aggressive , but i ’ll never forget walking out at @entity53			1
we felt like gladiators heading into the arena — we were waiting for the lions to be unleashed because it felt like we were about to be eaten alive			0
that was the first half of a play - off to reach @entity61 , so it was a massive game			2
@entity63 age : 22 caps : 16 the @entity67 - born centre half may give the impression of being a bit lumbering but he can shift			2
@entity72 age : 20 caps : 4 the youngest member of the starting xi , who was released by @entity27 when he was 15 , had only played 180 minutes of professional football the last time these two sides met			0
@entity79 defender @entity63 ( left ) and @entity80 ( right ) will likely complete the defence you ca n’t call @entity1 v @entity2 games friendlies			1
i had team - mates at @entity86 who i would play with and then against			2
you wanted to kick lumps out of each other , and that is what happened in those days			0
@entity92 was our captain at @entity86 , but ( with @entity2 ) he was against us			2
you want to beat @entity2 and vice versa , that wo n’t change			2
but after the game we went on holiday together ... and are still talking about it to this day			0
@entity99 age : 29 caps : 41 ‘ @entity107 ’ is the kind of snarling , snapping , fiery @entity103 who used to give @entity105 opponents nightmares			0
@entity108 age : 28 caps : 34 the @entity111 midfielder usually sits alongside @entity99 deeper in midfield but can be used further forward where his passing creates chances			0
midfielders @entity99 ( left ) and @entity108 ( right ) bring a wealth of experience between them @entity118 age : 24 caps : 18 slight and prone to playing with his cuffs down over his hands , @entity118 is a throwback to a different age			0
hugely popular with fans , he plays in the three behind the striker			0
@entity127 age : 28 caps : 33 the @entity130 forward carries a threat from any position in the three - man support unit behind the main striker			2
his work - rate makes him a certain starter			0
@entity118 ( left ) and @entity127 ( right ) both ply their trade in the @entity139 @entity140 age : 26 caps : 10 @entity144 - quick , @entity143 ’s best @entity1 moment came when he scored against @entity146 , later tweeting : ‘ ca n’t believe i beat @entity147			1
i do n’t even do that in @entity149 ! ’ @entity150 age : 26 caps : 4 the @entity1 coaching staff really love the @entity153 forward , who will deputise for the injured @entity154			1
big but mobile , the 26 - year - old is a former @entity2 youth player who qualifies for @entity1 through his dad			1
won the first of his four caps in may in a friendly against @entity161			0
@entity140 ( left ) and @entity150 ( right ) will be tasked with breaking down @entity2 's defence			1

@entity2 and @entity1 face each other in a friendly at @entity3
@entity5 's side looking for their sixth - straight win
@entity14 takes you through @entity16 's expected line - up
@entity18 likely to get his first cap in four years
@entity150 will deputise for the injured @entity154
