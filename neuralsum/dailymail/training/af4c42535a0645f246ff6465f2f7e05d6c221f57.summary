for singletons fed up with their family and friends asking whether they have met ‘ that special someone , ’ there are two new apps that could help them fake a relationship			2
the @entity9 and @entity11 apps will send convincing text messages and even voicemails from a virtual partner as ' proof ' of a relationship			1
it was created so that single people under pressure to find a partner , but who do n’t want to date , can practice flirting , or simply use the service to keep well - meaning relatives off their back			1
the @entity11 and invisible girlfriend apps ( pictured ) allow single people to create a partner and their personality , to make it look like they are dating			1
' proof ' will be provided in the form of text messages , enabling users to interact with their virtual partner the @entity36 - based company says on its website : ‘ @entity11 gives you real - world and social proof that you ’re in a relationship - even if you ’re not - so you can get back to living life on your own terms			1
’ currently available as a private beta version in the @entity45 and @entity46 , users will be able to download a gender - specific app and start receiving messages from a fictional partner , for around $ 25 a month			1
the monthly subscription will include 100 text messages ( examples shown ) , 10 voicemails and even a handwritten letter to begin with , they will choose a boyfriend or girlfriend from an ‘ extensive library ’ before customising the avatar 's personality and deciding how they would like to interact			1
they will be able to share photos and tell a believable back story to their friends about how they met , which can be concocted on the app , choosing from scenarios such as a bar , holiday or even climbing			0
the monthly subscription will include 100 text messages , 10 voicemails and even a handwritten letter , co-founder @entity71 told @entity72 , although the company says is planning different packages			1
the idea is that single users can show the plausible messages to friends and family in order to dodge awkward social situations , such as being set up with relatives ’ unsuitable acquaintances			1
‘ put simply , this platform helps you create credible , reasonable stories that you can bring home to curious mum , your buddies , and co-workers			0
these stories are backed by virtual and real - world social proof , ’ the firm says			2
mr @entity71 told @entity95 that the texts will be a mixture of automated messages and those written by humans			0
while ‘ proof ’ may one day extend to gifts and flowers send by the company and paid for by the user , it has ruled out offering sexts or naked pictures of virtual partners			1
the apps came about because co-founder @entity111 was newly divorced and tired of feeling pressurised to date			0
‘ around @entity115 , my mum called me and asked if she should set an extra place for someone i ’m bringing , ’ he explained in a blog post			0
users will be able to share photos and tell a believable back story to their friends about they and their ' partner ' met , which can be concocted on the app , choosing from scenarios such as a bar , holiday or even climbing , as pictured prospective users in the @entity45 and @entity46 have to apply to join the private beta , which is launching soon			2
‘ if accepted , you will receive access to create an account , build a boyfriend , and use all of the services for a small one - time fee , ’ the website says			0
when the app is widely released , users will choose a suitable package and select a boyfriend or girlfriend from a library , then customise his or her personality to their taste and decide how to interact			1
the main feature of the service is being able to exchange text messages with a virtual girlfriend or boyfriend			1
they will be able to do this via a dashboard , which they will also be able to use to create personalised stories about how they met			0
over time , the company will add voicemails and phone calls			0
there is also a possibility that the service may also extend to virtual partners sending gifts and flowers – paid for by the user – to enhance the deception , but the company has ruled out offering sexts or naked photos			2
‘ in that moment i realised how great it would be to have an answer for her that did n’t require me to actually be dating someone			0
’ the idea of virtual partners won a start - up competition , which encouraged the duo to build the apps			2
since then , they have worked out a way of making the text messages sound real so that users can text their invisible partner and receive a prompt reply			1
in the future , the company is working on a way to give virtual partners a face			0
‘ in essence , your boyfriend will be someone you ’re not ashamed to bring home to mum , a homebody bridging the gap between @entity191 and a wildcard			0
our boyfriends are credible proof who are obtainable and believable , ’ the company said			0
the founders think their apps meet a universal problem of society putting pressure on single people to be in a relationship and can be used when someone starts dating too			1
‘ we ’re excited about the ways @entity9 and boyfriend are helping people navigate the dating scene			2
the service creates a safe space for you to practice texting with a real human if you ’re out of practice			0
‘ sometimes it even inspires just enough jealousy to jolt that special person into committing , ’ they said .			0
