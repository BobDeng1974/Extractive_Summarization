by @entity0 published : 13:54 est , 14 march 2013 updated : 06:05 est , 15 march 2013 dangerous : @entity1 , who is thought to have attended terrorist training camps in @entity3 , ripped off his electronic tag and fled the county ’s most dangerous terror suspects could be free to walk the streets ‘ unconstrained ’ next year when powers used to control them expire , a watchdog has warned			1
the group of @entity12 fanatics includes two alleged members of a gang which plotted to kill thousands by downing @entity16 airliners and one linked to the failed july 21 bombings			0
currently their activities are limited by powerful court orders forcing them to wear electronic tags , obey curfews and report to the police – and restricting their contact with other dangerous individuals			1
but as a result of a watering down of the legal regime , made at the insistence of deputy prime minister @entity30 , the orders must come to an end after two years			2
it will mean up to ten potentially dangerous individuals becoming free from all controls early next year			1
previously , terror suspects were held under control orders which could be renewed annually , with some suspects in effect kept on them indefinitely			1
but the @entity30 insisted the regime should be weakened because of civil liberties concerns			0
following lengthy negotiations within the @entity44 , the new regime , labelled @entity41 and @entity42 came into force in early 2012			0
labelled control orders ‘ light ’ they were in some critical aspects weaker than the orders they replaced			1
as well as being time limited , they could not be used to remove individuals from their homes and send them to different parts of the country			2
in a report published today , a @entity60 watchdog , @entity57 said : ‘ some subjects who have been judged by the home secretary and by the courts to be potentially dangerous will then , absent prosecution or new evidence of terrorism - related activity , be free and unconstrained			1
’ mr @entity67 , the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation , suggested the men were likely to remain under close surveillance by @entity71			2
the agency was handed additional funds to help it counter the terror threat after the new regime was brought in			0
battle over terrorism laws : @entity30 leader @entity30 , right , challenged the strength of court orders leaving home secretary @entity81 , left , in a difficult position when they expire next year his report said : ‘ depending on the risk they are assessed to pose , they could of course remain thereafter the subject of covert surveillance , at least if they chose to remain in the @entity89			1
’ but he pointed out that without the controls , ‘ this is expensive and there are many competing priorities for the limited surveillance resource ’			0
the new orders can be extended only if the police or security services find new evidence suggesting the men are involved in terrorist activity			2
mr @entity67 acknowledged the men are aware that if they keep their noses clean they will be ‘ free of all constraints after two years ’			0
mr @entity67 said the two - year limit was the ' boldest ' change from control orders made by the government and it was ' tempting , in the most serious cases , to wish for longer '			1
in december , @entity1 , who is thought to have attended terrorist training camps in @entity3 , ripped off his electronic tag and fled			0
of those remaining on the orders , one was a former train driver considered to be a @entity89 extremist seeking to obtain terrorist training in @entity119			0
another attended a terrorist training camp in @entity122 in 2004 in the company of four of the five attempted suicide bombers involved in failed attacks on @entity126 in july 2005			0
mr @entity67 said allegations against some of the men were at the ‘ highest end of seriousness , even by the standards of international terrorism ’			0
a @entity60 spokesman said : ' @entity135 provide effective powers for dealing with terrorists whom we can not yet prosecute or deport			2
as part of the transition from control orders to @entity135 substantial extra resources were provided to the police and security services to increase the opportunities to prosecute for terrorist - related activity			1

terrorism suspects used to held under renewable control orders
now orders known as @entity135 have a two - year *maximum*
the new orders can be extended only if there is fresh evidence
ten potentially dangerous individuals will be free from next year
