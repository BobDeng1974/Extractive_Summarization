as the death toll from @entity2 reaches 3,800 , experts are warning that the virus could mutate and become airborne , meaning that it could be caught by breathing it in			1
the public is being told by health officials that the virus that causes @entity2 can not be transmitted through the air and can only be spread through direct contact with bodily fluids – blood , sweat , vomit , feces , urine , saliva or semen – of an infected person who is showing symptoms			1
however , several leading @entity2 researchers claim that the virus mutating and spreading through the air should not be ruled out			1
as the death toll from @entity2 reaches 3,800 , experts are warning that the virus could mutate and become airborne virus expert @entity26 , who in 1989 helped the @entity28 government tackle an outbreak of @entity2 among rhesus monkeys being used for research , told the @entity32 : ' we know for a fact that the virus occurs in sputum and no one has ever done a study [ disproving that ] coughing or sneezing is a viable means of transmitting			1
' unqualified assurances that @entity2 is not spread through the air are " misleading "			1
' dr @entity43 , who has undertaken research into @entity2 for @entity28 's @entity45 , told the paper : ' we just do n't have the data to exclude it [ becoming airborne ]			1
' meanwhile virologist dr @entity48 , a former head of the @entity50 's @entity49 , told the paper : ' i see the reasons to dampen down public fears			1
but scientifically , we 're in the middle of the first experiment of multiple , serial passages of ebola virus in man ...			0
@entity60 knows what this virus is going to look like			0
' in september , @entity63 , the director of the @entity64 at the @entity65 , writing in the @entity66 , said experts who believe that @entity2 could become airborne are loathed to discuss their concerns in public , for fear of whipping up hysteria			1
discussing the possible future course of the current outbreak , he said : ' the second possibility is one that virologists are loath to discuss openly but are definitely considering in private : that an ebola virus could mutate to become transmissible through the air			2
' the public is being told by health officials that the virus that causes @entity2 can not be transmitted through the air and can only be spread through direct contact with bodily fluids dr @entity63 warns viruses similar to @entity2 are notorious for replicating and reinventing themselves			1
it means the virus that first broke out in @entity87 in february may be very different to the one now invading other parts of @entity89			2
pointing to the example of the @entity92 influenza virus that saw bird flu sweep the globe in 2009 , dr @entity63 said : ' if certain mutations occurred , it would mean that just breathing would put one at risk of contracting @entity2			2
' dr @entity63 said public health officials , while discussing the possibility in private , are reluctant to air their concerns			1
virus expert @entity26 said unqualified assurances that @entity2 is not spread through the air are ' misleading ' ' they do n't want to be accused of screaming " fire ! " in a crowded theater - as i 'm sure some will accuse me of doing			1
' but the risk is real , and until we consider it , the world will not be prepared to do what is necessary to end the epidemic			0
' he called for the @entity116 to mobilise medical , public health and humanitarian aid to ' smother the epidemic '			2
the chair of the @entity122 's @entity121 , professor @entity123 of the @entity124 , said it is impossible to predict how any virus will mutate			0
he said scientists across the world do not know enough about genetics to be able to say how the ebola virus will change over time			0
he told @entity131 : ' no one can predict what will happen with the mutation of the virus			0
i would like to see the evidence that this could become a respiratory virus			0
' the first person diagnosed with @entity2 in the @entity28 died on wednesday despite intense but delayed treatment , and the government announced it was expanding airport examinations to guard against the spread of the deadly disease			1
the checks will include taking the temperatures of hundreds of travelers arriving from @entity89 at five major @entity28 airports			2
the new screenings will begin saturday at @entity151 's @entity150 and then expand to @entity152 and the international airports in @entity154 , @entity155 and @entity156			0
an estimated 150 people per day will be checked , using high - tech thermometers that do n't touch the skin			1
the @entity160 said the fever checks would reach more than 9 of 10 travelers to the @entity28 from the three heaviest - hit countries - @entity164 , @entity165 and @entity87			0
president @entity166 called the measures ' really just belt and suspenders ' to support protections already in place			0
@entity173 agents now look for people who are obviously ill , as do flight crews , and in those cases the @entity45 is notified			0
as of wednesday , @entity2 has killed about 3,800 people in @entity89 and infected at least 8,000 , according to the @entity178			1
a medical official with the @entity181 in @entity164 who tested positive for @entity2 arrived in the @entity183 city of @entity184 on thursday to be treated at a local clinic with specialist facilities , authorities said			2
the unidentified medic infected in @entity164 is the second member of the @entity116 mission , known as @entity189 , to contract the virus			0
the first died on september 25			0
he is the third @entity2 patient to arrive in @entity183 for treatment			2
the virus has taken an especially devastating toll on health care workers , sickening or killing more than 370 of them in the hardest - hit countries of @entity164 , @entity87 and @entity165 - places that already were short on doctors and nurses			0
there are no approved medications for @entity2 , so doctors have tried experimental treatments in some cases , including drugs and blood transfusions from others who have recovered from @entity2			2
the survivor 's blood could carry antibodies for the disease that will help a patient fight off the virus .			0
