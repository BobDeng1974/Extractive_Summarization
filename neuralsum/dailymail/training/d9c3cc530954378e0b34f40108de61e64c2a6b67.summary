by @entity0 for @entity1 with @entity4 's economic recovery fast outstripping the rest of @entity6 , we may like to think of ourselves as a well - off nation			2
but new data shows that , when compared to @entity10 states , @entity4 would actually rank as the second poorest if we were to join the @entity10 tomorrow			1
based on gdp per capita - the amount of wealth this country generates each year divided between everyone who lives here - the @entity4 would rank below @entity17 and just above @entity18			0
new data shows that if the @entity4 were to join the @entity10 it would rank as the second poorest state by @entity11 , behind @entity17 and in front of @entity18			1
it would also languish behind @entity22 , the poorest @entity23 country however the data , produced for @entity25 , also showed that without @entity26 the @entity4 would rank far below even the most deprived state in the @entity10			1
when all the wealth generated in @entity4 each year is divided out equally among the population , it comes to just $ 36,202 each , compared to @entity17 at $ 36,356 and @entity18 on $ 35,157			0
all three are behind @entity32 , where riots have been taking place , on $ 45,721 , and far removed from the most well - off state , @entity36 , which generates $ 80,741 dollars per person per year			0
@entity38 , editor of @entity25 , said : ' if @entity4 were to somehow leave the @entity23 and become the 51st state of @entity10 , we would actually be one of the poor states			0
' if you take our economic output , adjust for living costs and slot it into the @entity10 league table then the @entity4 emerges as the second - poorest state in the union			1
without @entity26 , which accounts for roughly 22 per cent of the @entity4 's gdp , this country would come in last place with $ 10,000 per person per year less than @entity18 ' we â€™re poorer than much - maligned @entity54 and @entity17 and well below @entity32 , the scene of all the unrest in recent weeks			2
' the @entity57 also calculated that without @entity26 , which accounts for around 22 per cent of the @entity4 's gdp , we would have a gdp per capita of $ 25,224 - almost $ 10,000 per year worse off than @entity18			2
the figures were also adjusted for @entity59 , meaning researchers took into account how much you can buy for your money in each country , ensuring the fairest result .			0

if @entity69 joined @entity10 tomorrow it would rank as the second poorest state
however , without @entity26 we would be in last place behind @entity18
@entity10 's *wealthiest* state is @entity36 , while @entity76 ranks top in @entity6
