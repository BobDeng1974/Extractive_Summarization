by @entity0 published : 18:25 est , 7 september 2012 updated : 07:19 est , 8 september 2012 chill - seeking : @entity1 , 34 , was the first person to kayak down a glacier this is the moment a daredevil kayaker d - ices with death - as he becomes the world 's first to plummet over a glacier 's waterfall			1
@entity1 , 34 , plunged into the icy waters beneath the 65ft freezing falls of the @entity12			1
alongside fellow pro paddlers @entity15 , 29 , and @entity16 , 26 , the trio performed a series of death - defying jumps in @entity20 , @entity21 , last month			1
@entity1 , from @entity22 , @entity23 , said : ' we wanted to push the boundaries of our sport			1
' it is something that had n't been done and it has been a whole year in the making , planning everything			2
' running waterfalls in a river is very dangerous , so doing it in one of the remotest locations on earth could have been potentially lethal			2
' the trio came face - to - face with polar bears during their 12 - day boat and kayak adventure through @entity20 , one of the world 's most desolate landscapes			1
they wore dry suits specially designed to keep them from hypothermia while swimming in the waters			2
but with just one kayak between them , @entity16 opted to spectacularly backflip into the water , while @entity15 hurled himself feet first into the sea below			2
@entity16 , from @entity75 , @entity23 , added : ' from the edge all i could see was the expanse of the glacier - and some sea birds flying around me			0
' it was one of the most amazing sights and feelings of the whole trip			0
head over heels in the name of adrenaline : @entity16 , 26 , starts his decent in style with a daring backflip where 's your head at ? the three kayakers had to watch they did n't clip themselves on the way down @entity15 surrenders himself to the @entity21 waters after leaping off the glacial shelf ' i 've made a lot of jumps and backflips , but never in such an extreme place			1
' i was just telling myself not to slip on the ice and make sure to rotate all the way and not get lost in the crazy view on the way around and down			0
' @entity63 @entity15 , a former waterfall kayaking world - record holder from @entity63 , continued : ' our first attempt was not successful , and we were about to give up the jump with the kayak			1
' we could only carry one kayak up there because it was so dangerous so i volunteered to jump			1
the group spent twelve days in @entity20 where they came face - to - face with polar bears the northern landscape is one of the most desolate on the planet a jagged iceberg off the coast of the @entity12 ' there began moments of pure adrenaline as the sun set and shined off the ice			1
it was a privileged view			0
' it had taken two painstaking days to find the safest spot to perform their chilling feats - all while carrying rifles to protect them from rogue polar bears			0
@entity1 added : ' they are beautiful animals but they are very dangerous and volatile when hungry			0
' we were hundreds and hundreds of miles north of the nearest town so we were carrying rifles to protect us against the bears			0
' there were many dangers , not least the polar bears			0
you had to be careful of treading on cracks in the ice hidden by fresh snowfall and the face of the glacier was constantly moving			0
' it was probably the most exposed situation i have ever been in			0
' @entity16 said : ' it is one of the most difficult situations i had been in with the trip			0
a step for mankind : @entity1 became the first person ever to kayak over a glacial waterfall ' i 've never known a time when doing a jump , or backflip where standing on the edge was as dangerous as the actual landing			1
' there were polar bears , crevasses , sudden storms , and freezing water , then once at the edge , the danger of the glacier calving while standing on the edge amplified the feeling of difficulty and consequence			0
' during their 12 day round trip from @entity180 in @entity20 , temperatures plummeted as low as minus @entity181 with the wind chill - cold enough to catch hypothermia in a matter of minutes			2
but the excitement of the jump kept them going			2
@entity16 added : ' it had been a long day to get to the edge , and i was the last to jump , so i was getting pretty cold , but the anticipation kept me plenty warm			1
' video : @entity1 plunges into the icy waters beneath @entity12			1
