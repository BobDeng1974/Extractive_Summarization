the founder of @entity1 is doing nothing to change his image as a boy wonder as he has revealed that he loves flying toy drones both in the office and in the open air of @entity8			2
@entity9 , 27 , is the ceo of the social media platform and sold the company to @entity12 for $ 1.1billion earlier this year but that does n't stop him from acting like a kid in their company headquarters			1
' i can have it over on the other side of the office , bothering people while i ’m at my desk			2
usually i send it straight over my lawyer ’s head , ' he told @entity25 in an interview about his management style			2
' i ’m obsessed with drones right now			0
i fly my drones all over @entity8			0
these things are not regulated			0
i ’ve had five of them			0
' man in charge : @entity9 , 27 , is the founder and ceo of @entity1 and apparently keeps a very relaxed atmosphere in the social media company 's office in @entity41 by flying around toy drones many automatically associate drones with the unmanned military aircrafts that have been used extensively by president @entity46 's administration overseas , but the smaller versions are available for personal use			1
@entity9 appears to be a big fan , and his latest hobby is an expensive and elusive one , but that is not much of a concern for the tech giant			0
his net worth is said to be in the area of $ 200million , and that helps him fund this newfound hobby			0
' you get them from @entity62 , so they all come @entity64 , which means that you have to wait for them for , like — you ’re lucky if they come within two months			1
so i usually have a few on order at any given time , ' he told the magazine			0
@entity9 founded @entity1 in 2007 and became well - known throughout the business world when the site was purchased in may			1
money to burn : @entity9 orders the drones from @entity62 and he has plenty to spend after selling his company for $ 1.1billion to @entity12 ( seen here with @entity12 ceo @entity79 in may ) some of the more astounding details of the deal were only revealed last month when the regulatory filings were made public , disclosing that he gets an additional $ 81million if he stays at the head of the company for the next four years			1
though the slight man is described as being a rather unassuming ceo figure in the @entity25 profile , he has made one decidedly corporate decision since taking on the role			0
shortly after being bought by @entity12 , @entity1 began running ads - first on their mobile site then on desktop - accessed versions as well			1
the move marked a 180 - turn for @entity9 , as he previously said in 2010 that the thought of running ads on the free web service ' really turns our stomachs ' .			1

the 27 - year - old buys them from @entity62 and has *multiple* orders in at all times
