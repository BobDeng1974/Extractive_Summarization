by @entity1 reporter published : 07:13 est , 2 september 2012 updated : 07:40 est , 2 september 2012 a flasher has been let off undergoing group therapy as part of his punishment , after having a sex change to become a woman			1
@entity9 , 47 , from @entity10 , was given a community groupwork programme for men after his conviction in 2010 for outraging public decency by behaving in an indecent manner			1
but a court has told @entity9 he can now undergo the therapy one - to - one with a probation officer after he underwent gender realignment therapy and changed his name to @entity21			1
before & after : flasher @entity9 , left , before he underwent gender reallignment to become @entity21 , right @entity9 was arrested for committing a string of offences in @entity26 between march and november 2009 , while still living as a man			1
he was convicted in january 2010 and given a community order with supervision requirements as well as being ordered to undergo group therapy sessions			1
it 's unknown if he was placed on the sex offenders register as part of his punishment			2
since his conviction he made the decision to undergo a sex change - forcing @entity38 to reassess his punishment during a hearing last month			1
it 's thought to be the first time ever officials have been forced to alter the conditions of a sex offender 's punishment in this way			2
a @entity48 spokesperson said : ' the suitability of treatment programmes for offenders is assessed on a case by case basis and the decision to vary a community sentence requirement is a matter for the courts			2
' if an offender is not deemed suitable for group courses their offending behaviour will still be addressed on a one to one basis with specialist help if required			2
' @entity64 ? ' @entity21 's punishment was changed during a hearing at @entity67 last month a source close to the case insisted @entity9 had not been given a reprieve and that his punishment would just be ' carried out in a different way '			1
they added : ' obviously this is a very unusual case and authorities in the @entity75 have never had to deal with a situation like this before			0
' the groupwork programme specifically for men so it was n't suitable for a woman to be on the course			0
' as the offender became a woman part way through the course something had to be done			0
' there was never a chance that the punishment would be removed - it will just be carried out in a different way			0
' but campaigners insist he should be forced to carry out the punishment he was given			0
@entity93 , director of @entity94 , said : ' we have been waiting for this kind of thing to start , and it all stems from the @entity99 which is a real hot potato at the moment			0
' what difference does change in gender make ? ' it is irrelevant whether this person has changed gender or is undergoing gender reassignment - they have committed an offence for which they were sentenced by the court			1
' a change of name or body does not make them any less dangerous or mean that they should not carry a sentence that the court ordered			0
' sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
