by @entity0 published : 06:08 est , 15 february 2013 updated : 12:30 est , 15 february 2013 a decorative plate which hung precariously on a wall behind a door on a flimsy piece of wire has sold for almost £ 570,000 after it turned out to be an ancient relic			2
the woman who owned it had no idea of its true value and had kept the @entity13 pottery plate on her kitchen wall in her cottage home for many years			1
she only realised its importance when she invited an antiques expert to her home in @entity20 to value some items			2
ancient relic : this 16th century @entity13 plate hung precariously on a wall behind a door on a flimsy piece of wire before an art expert suspected it might be worth a lot of money			1
it sold at auction yesterday for £ 567,000 @entity34 suspected it might have been valuable and carefully removed it from the wall			1
he later identified it as @entity38 ( tin - glazed ) pottery dating to about 1540			1
he said it was lucky the plate had not been damaged by the door being slammed open against it			2
despite it having an inch long repaired crack at its base , mr @entity34 told the unidentified woman it was in excellent condition and could be worth £ 100,000			1
but the plate , which depicts a scene called @entity53 , sold for an incredible £ 567,000 pounds when it was auctioned yesterday			0
the owner , who had inherited the item from a relative , was said to have been delighted with the price			2
mr @entity34 described the find as a true ' @entity59 ' moment , similar to when @entity60 found an old pocket watch that had been hidden in his garage for years and only for it to be worth millions			1
measuring 16 inches in diameter , the plate depicts the feast of @entity66 , following a print by @entity69 printmaker @entity68 in which the king and his wife are approached by @entity72 with the head of @entity74			0
the scene also shows a town , a river with bathers and a boat party			0
art expert @entity34 suspected the plate might be valuable and later identified it as @entity38 pottery dating to around 1540 mr @entity34 , of auctioneers @entity83 of @entity84 , @entity85 , said : ‘ it was just hanging on wall from a wire frame almost hidden away and it turned out to be worth a fortune			1
‘ it had been there for years			0
she had inherited it and grown up with it but did not attach a great deal of value to it			0
‘ it was on the wall behind a door which was always open so you could only see about two inches of it			2
‘ when the wind blows through a house it can open and shut doors so it is quite frightening to think what could have happened if the door had blown back on to the plate			2
‘ in the position it was in it is lucky nothing happened to it over the years			0
‘ this is undoubtedly the most important piece of pottery i have held in my 28 years experience in this industry and is one of the highest prices ever paid for a piece of @entity13 pottery			1
‘ it was quite dusty when we first looked at it but the condition it is in for something which is nearly 500 years old is superb			0
the quality of the drawing on the surface is splendid			0
’ mr @entity34 said when he first saw the plate he thought it was a 19th century copy which would be worth a couple of thousand pounds			1
' important piece of pottery ' : the plate depicts the feast of @entity66 in which @entity74 's head is presented on a plate but after taking the plate to professor @entity142 at @entity143 at the @entity144 he discovered it was worth a lot more			0
prof @entity142 inspected the plate and concluded it was made in the @entity13 walled city of @entity149 around 1540			1
mr @entity34 said : ‘ i was a bit nervous when i was driving it to the museum			1
i was taking extra care to avoid any pot holes			0
’ when it came to auction , there was interest among bidders from across the @entity160 , @entity161 , @entity13 , @entity162 , @entity69 , @entity163 , @entity164 and the @entity165 mr @entity34 said : ‘ i was expecting it to fetch over £ 100,000 but it certainly exceeded those expectations without question			1
