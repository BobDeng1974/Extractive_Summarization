all the world wants a @entity3 — players and coaches			1
@entity6 ’s export trade in rugby men is booming , with @entity6 the prized commodity			1
this week , two @entity10 clubs have taken the plunge in deciding to recruit from the most successful sporting team on @entity13 — with @entity14 lining up prop @entity15 and @entity16 finalising a deal for lock @entity18			1
the @entity19 have gone a step further and opted to put a @entity21 , @entity22 , in charge of their post-brian @entity25 revival mission			1
@entity6 lock @entity18 is on the brink of joining @entity16 kiwi @entity22 ( second right ) has been tasked with leading @entity14 he will arrive from @entity31 with supreme credentials			1
as a former team - mate of @entity34 , he will be expected to emulate the @entity36 coach by prospering on this side of the equator , but a gold - plated @entity39 c.v			1
is not conclusive proof of an ability to thrive in these parts			1
tactics and conditions are markedly different			2
a @entity3 accent provides no guarantee of effective rugby wisdom this far from home , although that is often the awestruck assumption			2
since the game turned professional , countless southern imports have failed to live up to their lavish billing			2
for instance , @entity16 are being superbly served by all black prop @entity56 now , but scrum - half @entity57 , another who wore the silver fern with distinction , was unable to deliver the sort of red - hot performances worthy of his blue - chip reputation			1
scrum - half @entity57 has failed to live up to expectation with @entity16 pick the right recruit from the far side and it can be a wondrous decision , as @entity71 have found with @entity72 — likewise @entity73 , with @entity74			1
perhaps @entity15 and @entity18 will acquit themselves well and savour the hard knocks up front , as @entity77 is at @entity78			1
it might be that incoming forwards prosper more than box - office backs such as @entity82 , who utterly failed to set the world alight for @entity84			2
@entity21 coaches are all the rage			1
three of the @entity88 have them , as do two of the four @entity91 regions , but they have to embrace cultural differences , as @entity34 has done and as @entity25 did at @entity93 years ago			2
kiwi @entity34 has been a success as the head coach of @entity97 other @entity98 have thought that their methods and philosophies could be applied here without modifications and they have been wrong			2
@entity104 ’s bad - tempered reign at @entity105 encapsulated that flawed logic			2
so , best wishes to @entity108 , @entity15 and @entity18 , and to their compatriots who will surely join the northern migration			1
but they should be in no doubt — a @entity3 passport will ensure safe passage through customs , but not through the weekly maelstrom of the @entity117			2
an array of @entity117 statistics for the season to date have highlighted why @entity121 will not wait a moment longer than necessary to select @entity123 , when he qualifies on residency next year			0
in light of the grim news that @entity129 will be out for at least six months after breaking a leg , there has been a tide of support for @entity133 to receive a recall , and he is certainly worthy of consideration based on prime form and enduring — perhaps unprecedented — influence			0
@entity140 ' @entity139 - born star @entity123 is in line for an @entity121 call - up once he qualifies on residency next year but the data lays bare the impact of @entity140 ’ @entity139 - born force of nature			0
@entity123 has made 154 carries , second only to @entity149 of @entity73 , and he is third in the ‘ defenders beaten ’ category with 42 , behind two fellow @entity153 game - breakers , @entity154 and @entity155			0
when it comes to offloads , @entity123 is behind @entity158 but not far — with 22 to the 36 - year - old ’s 23			0
@entity123 is also joint top of the ‘ turnovers won ’ chart			0
he is making a profound impact and holding out for @entity121 recoognition is likely to prove a shrewd move			1
@entity166 has @entity168 accent clubs , regions and provinces resume @entity166 combat this weekend with the pool tables pointing to @entity174 and @entity117 dominance of the quarter - final places			0
@entity177 should have the firepower to take pool 1 to the wire by beating @entity181 at home , while @entity183 can win in @entity184 , to throw @entity185 wide open			0
@entity186 will be helping to steer @entity177 to victory against @entity181 this weekend harlequins v @entity140 is too close to call , but expect a reaction from @entity93 against the @entity190 in @entity191 after their grim defeat at @entity105 last weekend			0
@entity78 are likely to snuff out the @entity91 challenge tonight by beating the @entity194			0
@entity195 may be the lone @entity197 representatives in the last eight , which would leave the new tournament with a lack of variety			0
if the @entity201 miss out , it may well boil down to an @entity202 — which was meant to be the fall - back plan during their threatened breakaway , not the actual outcome			0
the last word of all the frustrations that @entity209 has to put up with as @entity121 head coach , surely the toughest to accept must be the vast gulf between @entity212 in theory and @entity212 in reality			1
the @entity16 captain is in danger of becoming the wasted enigma of the era			1
his performance in the @entity117 encounter with @entity177 last friday night summed up what drives the national coaches to distraction , as he mixed flashes of effortless class with far too many chronic lapses			0
the @entity121 no 12 shirt is there for the taking if @entity16 's @entity212 can cut out the chronic lapses suspect decision - making has so often been his downfall and it was in evidence again at @entity234			1
@entity121 ’s @entity236 shirt is there for the taking , but @entity212 is not showing signs that he can take a firm grip on it			0
he has all the wide - ranging attributes that @entity243 sees in his ultimate vision for the position			0
at his best , he is the second receiver at inside centre who can help to ignite @entity121 ’s back line , but without the addition of composure and consistency , his hopes of fulfilling that potential are destined to fade , which would be a desperate pity .			0
