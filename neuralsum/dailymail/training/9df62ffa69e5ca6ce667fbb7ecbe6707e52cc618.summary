@entity1 press secretary @entity0 denied on thursday a television news reporter 's day - old claim that reporters often ' provide the questions to him in advance , ' before his daily briefings , and that he sometimes provides answers on paper before taking the podium			1
@entity15 hours , the @entity12 reporter at the center of a quick - drying controversy admitted she got the whole thing wrong			1
@entity12 news anchor @entity17 reported wednesday night on @entity18 that in an ' off the record ' meeting , @entity0 had told a handful of local tv reporters that @entity1 correspondents often tell him before daily briefings what they 'll be asking			1
' if only this were true , ' @entity0 told mailonline thursday morning			1
by mid-afternoon @entity17 , fresh of a @entity29 - to - @entity12 flight , walked parts of her story back in an email to @entity27			1
but she insisted that she herself was asked to submit a question in advance for @entity0 on wednesday afternoon			1
' ' [ @entity55 ] ut in discussing it with a staff member the night before , we decided i would save it for the president			0
i was attempting to not waste national time on a local question , but in my attempt at explaining that i unintentionally made it sound like that experience applied to everyone			1
' ' that is my mistake , ' @entity17 added , ' and i own up to it			2
' meanwhile , @entity38 issued a separate statement attributed to @entity17 , but the @entity71 affiliate station quickly deleted it from its website			1
assignment editor @entity73 told @entity27 that it ' apparently ... was not the correct statement			1
' @entity17 's on - air commentary remains on the website , however			1
' we started here shortly after 8 o'clock with a coffee with press secretary @entity0 inside his office in the @entity81 , ' she said on the air , before making a stunning breach of journalistic protocol by reporting on an ' off the record ' meeting and airing a photo of it			1
@entity38 issued this extended quote thursday afternoon from @entity17 , and then quickly withdrew it , saying in an email that ' apparently that was not the correct statement ' : ' it seems much had been inferred about my observations following my @entity1 visit yesterday			1
' first , i did not take notes during our coffee with @entity0 because it was off the record			2
but when i referenced the meeting in my live reports i did say that it was a great opportunity to talk about the challenges of his day and how he has to be so well - versed on many topics each day			2
' in my live report i also wanted to share my impression of my experience in getting a question answered during the briefing			2
i was indeed asked to provide my question in advance			2
because my question was largely of local interest , i chose to save it for my interview with the president instead			2
' my mistake was to lump that experience with my coffee meeting reference , inadvertently giving mr. @entity0 credit for that when in fact it did not come from him			2
i regret giving anyone the impression that it was from conversation i had with mr. @entity0			2
i do not attend those briefings regularly and can not speak directly to the process for non-visiting journalists			0
none of my observations stemmed from my off - the - record meeting with @entity0			1
' ' and this was off - the - record , ' she reported , ' so we were able to ask him all about some of the preparation that he does on a regular basis for talking to the press in his daily press briefings			2
he showed us a very long list of items that he has to be well - versed on every single day			0
' ' and then he also mentioned that a lot of times , ' @entity17 added , ' unless it 's something breaking , the questions that the reporters actually ask – or the correspondents – they are provided to him in advance			1
' ' so then he knows what he 's going to be answering and sometimes those correspondents and reporters also have those answers printed in front of them , because of course it helps when they 're producing their reports for later on			2
' @entity17 responded to a request for comment hours later			2
@entity73 initially told @entity27 that she was on a plane and unavailable			1
but the @entity1 was quick to dismiss her account of what @entity0 said			1
@entity0 himself tweeted a second denial after this report was first published			0
@entity17 's recounting of her day at the @entity1 aired wednesday in at least two separate on - air reports			1
one was uploaded to a hastily created @entity173 account and then reported by @entity174			0
it 's unknown who published that video online			0
hours after deleting the anchor 's hastily issued statement @entity38 released a second one : ' last night during my live reports from the @entity1 i attempted to describe the highlights of the day			1
i was speaking off the cuff and unscripted and in the process i made two major mistakes : i reported an off the record conversation and what i reported was not accurate			0
' i took a conversation about the preparation for a press briefing and muddied it with my own experience of wanting to provide a question for the press briefing			0
i incorrectly applied the process to everyone			0
that was wrong and it was bad reporting			0
but it was not intentional and i would never purposely report inaccurate information			0
' the @entity1 never asked for my questions in advance and never instructed me what to ask			1
i chose to provide one of my questions in advance of the press briefing because i wanted to make sure it would have broad appeal			0
i did not attribute or report factually last night and for that i deeply apologize			0
' i pride myself on truth and objectivity			0
i sincerely regret any harm i 've caused and i hope that you will continue to place your trust in the hardworking journalists who make up @entity216			0
' @entity17 published this photo of what she said was an ' off the record ' meeting wednesday morning with @entity0 , during which -- she claims -- he said he often receives daily briefing questions in advance @entity225 conducted his interviews wednesday with several local news anchors standing up , @entity17 said , so the brief q&a sessions could be kept to a 4 - minute limit a longer broadcast segment , in which @entity17 makes the same claim about @entity0 's advance knowledge of daily briefing questions , is the one on @entity38 's website			1
' they provide the questions to him in advance , ' she said in that report			0
' and so he is already preparing for the answer			0
and sometimes – in some cases , i should say – he actually prepares that answer for them , so that they can have that to work on their reports later on			0
' @entity17 also told viewers that she was limited to four minutes for her brief encounter with the president , but ' stretched it to six			1
' at the beginning of @entity38 's video , she 's seen glancing off - camera to see if her time has started			1
the interview was conducted with both parties standing up in the @entity257			0
' the reason why we 're standing , i was told by one of his staffers , is because he likes to get comfortable when he 's sitting , and he tends to get very chatty , ' she said			0
' and so this was another way to keep him – and us – at the four minutes that they were suggesting that we not go over			0
' ' yeah , ' responded anchor @entity266 , ' and it sounds like the pressure is on when some guy is standing behind him with a countdown clock			0
that 's a little ridiculous			0

@entity17 of @entity38 in @entity12 claimed @entity0 told reporters that @entity1 correspondents often tell him their questions ahead of time
' if only this were true , ' @entity0 told @entity27
@entity17 later walked back her story , but said that she was asked to submit a local - news question in writing before wednesday 's @entity1 briefing
she *conceded* thursday that she should *n't* have said the practice is common
@entity17 also broke protocol by telling viewers about an ' off the record ' meeting with @entity0
she said in a statement that she was mistaken about that also , but the statement *disappeared* from @entity38 's website in less than *30* minutes
