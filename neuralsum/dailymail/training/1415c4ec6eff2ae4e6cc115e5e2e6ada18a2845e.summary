the maverick backbencher failed to inform the @entity9 authorities about the money she received for eight media appearances , including taking part in the @entity14 reality show a year ago			1
despite accusing investigators of a ' witch hunt ' today in a short personal statement she told mps she apologised ' fully and unreservedly for what was a genuinely inadvertent breach of the rules '			1
@entity3 mp @entity2 apologised to the @entity9 ' fully and unreservedly ' , above , for breaching rules relating to registering her media earnings , in the @entity23 she has been censured by the @entity24 , which also complained about her attitude towards the investigation			1

she claimed she would be able to reach an audience of millions , discussing important policy issues like lowering the abortion limit			0
the @entity28 mp has been censured by the @entity24 committee after branding their investigation a ' witch hunt ' instead she was pictured performing jokes with @entity42 from @entity43 and eating camel toe and ostrich anus in a challenge against @entity48 star @entity47			1
she was later suspended from the @entity3 party , and only allowed to return to the party fold in may this year			2
the investigation into her finances was triggered after a complaint by @entity56 mp @entity55			2
ms @entity2 insisted the money had been paid to her company , @entity71 , and did not need to be declared			1
she said she had ' no obligation to answer for what payments are made by whom to @entity76 ' and would only register earnings if @entity76 paid her anything			2
trial : the investigation was triggered after @entity56 mp @entity55 raised doubts about ms @entity2 ' finances @entity2 has repeatedly made headlines for her outspoken remarks , including publicly criticising @entity85 and @entity86			1
march 2012 : on @entity85 and @entity86 's benefits changes : ' the problem is that policy is being run by two public schoolboys who do n't know what it 's like to go to the supermarket and have to put things back on the shelves because they ca n't afford it for their children 's lunchboxes			0
what 's worse , they do n't care , either			0
' april 2012 : ' not only are @entity85 and @entity86 two posh boys who do n't know the price of milk , but they are two arrogant posh boys who show no remorse , no contrition , and no passion to want to understand the lives of others - and that is their real crime			0
' may 2012 : ' in order for @entity85 ’s position as leader to be challenged , the chairman of the committee needs to receive 46 signatures from @entity117 ... i would guess that those signatures are already coming in and will reach 46 by @entity120			0
' november 2011 : on taking part in i 'm a celeb : ' if that is where 16 million people are , it 's where politicians need to be @entity128 2012 : ' i long for the day @entity129 is prime minister			1
he is a good man and a hero of mine , and he can reach people other politicians ca n’t			0
' january 2013 : on talk @entity3 mp @entity135 was gearing up to challenge mr @entity85 : ' he has got leadership potential			0
' march 2013 : ' we need a change of direction			0
i think if these polls stay like this and we did badly in the may elections i think @entity85 and @entity86 will be forced to change direction			0
' but the committee said it was ' hard to believe ' that she would have been asked to take part in the show if she were not an mp , and as a result the earnings were linked to her role in parliament			0
the committee ordered ms @entity2 to register the details required by the rules but also took issue with her refusal to co-operate properly with the investigation , including her ' attitude toward the commissioner 's inquiry '			1
she has updated her entry on the register of @entity117 ' interests at the end of october , covering the previous 12 months			0
it showed @entity169 's gross income was £ 142,000 , giving a profit of £ 82,000 , and that ms @entity2 had taken a £ 10,000 dividend on october 30			1
the committee said : ' payments directly made for services should be registered whether or not they are made to a third party			0
' but ms @entity2 told them that her contract with @entity14 meant she could not publicly say how much she had earned for taking part in i 'm a celebrity			1
she told the committee : ' if i were ever to disclose and to say , “ this is the amount of money that i am paid by @entity14 ” , i would fall foul of that contract and would be at the mercy of @entity14			1
' she appeared on the show alongside comedian @entity187 , darts player @entity188 , boxer @entity189 and @entity192 actress @entity190 , who eventually won			0

she has since landed signed a ‘ six - figure ’ book deal to write three novels			0
ms @entity2 threatened to sue standards commissioner @entity202 for pursuing a ' witch hunt ' against her			1
in a letter to the commissioner ms @entity2 wrote : ' i should inform you that i feel your report amounts to a witch hunt and i have forwarded it on to legal professionals for further advice regarding my position in relation to the committee and you personally			1
' you are choosing to use a vexatious complaint made against me to reinforce your ' on the hoof , make it up as you go ' policy			0
' i will not tolerate that or any report which invokes libellous negative coverage against me as a result and will not hesitate to pursue you personally should that be the case			0
' in a letter to ms @entity202 last month the mp said she had taken on extra media work to meet a £ 67,000 legal bill			2
' as a single parent with financial responsibilities for a disabled ex-husband , an elderly mother and a child in full - time education , i faced the possibility of bankruptcy or finding a way to pay the bill			0
' this is the initial impetus that drove me to undertake media work			2
' ms @entity2 won a @entity241 against @entity243 star @entity47 , which involved eating ostrich anus the report said : ' the @entity23 ’s @entity247 and disciplinary system depend on members being prepared to explain their conduct , to submit to public scrutiny and where necessary , to respond to the commissioner ’s inquiries			1
' we recommend that ms @entity2 register all payments in respect of her employment , whether or not they have been channelled through @entity71 or any other third party and apologise to the @entity23 by way of a @entity260			1
