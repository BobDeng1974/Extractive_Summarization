a blood test being developed by a group of @entity3 scientists could predict alzheimer 's disease two decades before patients show signs of the illness			1
@entity9 researchers , who discovered the test , previously helped identify changes in the brain happened 20 years before people started presenting symptoms of the disease , which can be detected by performing brain - imaging procedures			2
alzheimer 's disease is the most common form of dementia with sufferers having deteriorating memory loss which gets worse over time as well as affecting their behaviour			1
initial research carried out on a trial group resulted in one of five participants positive for the disease despite having no memory loss			1
further tests carried out using brain - imaging procedures showed these patients had signs of degeneration associated with @entity30 's			1
the research was carried out by the university 's @entity47			0
researcher dr @entity49 ( right ) said the test ( left ) had the potential to predict @entity30 's up to 20 years before sufferers showed signs of the disease research was carried out on a trial group where one of five participants tested positive for the disease despite having no memory loss the department 's dr @entity49 said the test had the potential to predict alzheimer 's up to 20 years before sufferers showed signs of the disease			1
she told @entity65 that the data available from their research could only provide a five - year detection as it had only been going for seven years , but with more participants they would be able to match up brain - imaging techniques with blood tests to track how far back it could predict			2
' we wanted to develop a blood test to be used as a pre-screen to identify [ patients ] who needed a brain scan and those it was unnecessary to do a brain scan , ' dr @entity49 said			2
dr @entity49 said it would also provide a more accessible method for people to accurately find out how likely they were to get the disease			0
dr @entity49 - who is part of the team - said the test had the potential to predict @entity30 's up to 20 years before sufferers showed signs of the disease ' this test provides the possibility of early detection of ad by using a simple blood test which has been designed to also be cost - effective , ' she said			1
' furthermore , it is highly accessible for patients and physicians compared to organising a brain scan or undergoing a neuropsychological test			0
' patients with a family history of ad or those with memory concerns could be tested during a standard health check at a medical clinic			0
' this test could ease concerns for patients experiencing normal memory problems due to natural ageing			0
those identified as high risk could then be monitored by their doctor			0
' the @entity9 findings were published in science journal @entity118 in collaboration with @entity120 , the @entity121 , @entity122 and @entity123 .			0

*ongoing* research is being carried out by the @entity9
the blood test has a 91 per cent accuracy rate in predicting @entity30 's
a trial group resulted in one in five participants being positive for disease
this is despite the fact they showed no *visible* signs of memory loss
the test could be available within five years after more research is done
