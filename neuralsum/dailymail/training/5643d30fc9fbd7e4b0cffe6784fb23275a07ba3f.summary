transcripts revealed the men frequently talking about ' books ' , code for weapons , and needing to find a ' new library ' , code for arms dealer			0
@entity0 's burial comes after his brother @entity13 was buried in his hometown of @entity18 yesterday			1

there are no plans as yet for the burial of fellow @entity6 attacker @entity73 he added : ' i do n't want a grave that serves to attract fanatics			2
i do n't want a place that promotes hate			0
' he was buried last night , in the most discrete , anonymous way possible			2
' but speaking on @entity110 , mr @entity91 said he was forced to allow the burial by the government , which enforced a @entity12 law that grants a right to be buried in the town of last residence			0
there are no current plans to bury @entity73 , who killed five people - including four hostages at a kosher market in @entity6 - before he was killed by police on january 9			2
