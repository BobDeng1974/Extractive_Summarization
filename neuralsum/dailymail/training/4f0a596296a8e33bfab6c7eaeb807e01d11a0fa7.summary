on their way ? new arrivals in the @entity4 port of @entity5 the @entity6 has abandoned identity checks on illegal immigrants trying to sneak into the country from @entity5			1
in a huge security downgrade , @entity13 officials no longer photograph or fingerprint immigrants found stowing away in lorries at the @entity17 ferry port			1
instead , they are handed to @entity4 police , who free them , enabling them to try again and again until they succeed			1
the scrapping of fingerprinting means that if the migrants reach @entity6 and apply for asylum under a false identity , claiming to be refugees , immigration officers have no way of identifying them as having previously tried to enter @entity6 illegally			1
as a result , they can not expose their new identity as fake			2
economic migrants , criminals and terrorists can now slip much more easily through the net			2
this contrasts with the increasingly strict checks on holiday - makers , who have to hand over their passport which contains biometric information to confirm their identities			2
@entity47 mp @entity46 last night called for the ‘ extraordinary ’ and ‘ disturbing ’ loophole to be closed			1
the scandal , which makes a mockery of @entity52 promises of tougher immigration controls , has been going on for more than three years			0
it came to light during an official inspection , which published its report two weeks ago			0
the security gap also means migrants ’ details can not be checked against prints and photos taken in the @entity64 country where they first enter @entity65 – often @entity66 , @entity67 or @entity68			1
under the rules , migrants are meant to live in the @entity64 country where they arrived while their asylum claim is processed there			0
but many immediately head straight for @entity6 because the benefits system is more generous			1
once in the @entity6 , they can avoid being sent back to the original country of entry by lying about their identity			1
terrorists and foreign criminals can create horror stories about their past lives and pretend to be refugees			0
economic migrants seeking a ‘ better life ’ are also able to fabricate tales of needing urgent asylum , claiming they come from war - torn countries			0
this creates havoc in the @entity6 ’s overburdened asylum system as officials try to sort out who is a genuine refugee			1
the @entity13 claims it catches 8,000 would - be illegal migrants in lorries in northern @entity4 each year			1
but this official tally is now in doubt because a migrant whose identity goes unchecked in @entity5 can make multiple attempts as a stowaway to get to @entity6 while being counted again and again as a new ‘ catch ’			1
@entity102 , independent chief inspector of @entity103 , who wrote the report , said : ‘ it seems odd that ordinary travellers are subject to 100 per cent checks when those travelling illegally are not subject to this regime			0
people attempting to enter the @entity6 concealed in freight vehicles , who are discovered by @entity13 , are no longer fingerprinted at @entity5			1
’ loophole : the change in policy was revealed in a highly - critical , independent review of @entity6 's border controls @entity6 border officials stopped processing ‘ clandestines discovered in freight vehicles ’ at the port in january 2010			1
they blamed the lack of available ‘ detention ’ facilities			0
however , the chief inspector has called for the @entity126 to ‘ reconsider ’ identity checks to protect @entity6 borders			2
mr @entity46 said last night : ‘ it is very disturbing that the @entity130 is not doing the basics when it catches illegal immigrants			1
by definition illegal immigration is a crime and it is very hard to see why it should be treated any differently from any other crime			2
‘ if we stopped fingerprinting burglars because we lacked detention facilities there would be uproar			0
ministers will now have to explain why this offence should be treated differently			0
the government needs to take urgent action to correct this extraordinary situation			0
’ @entity149 , @entity47 mp for @entity150 , said he had been assured that the @entity126 would review the situation			0
he added : ‘ it is clearly important that we have the tightest possible border security			2
the report is clear these people should be fingerprinted and it is right that the @entity126 is going to review it			0
’ last night the @entity126 said scrapping checks freed up the @entity13 to concentrate on searching vehicles for stowaways and was decided by the last @entity161 government			0
a spokesman added : ‘ would - be illegal immigrants found by @entity13 in freight vehicles are handed to the @entity4 authorities for processing , including fingerprinting where appropriate			1
’ however , during a @entity171 investigation , migrants caught on the lorries said they had not been fingerprinted or photographed by either the @entity6 or @entity4 authorities			1
@entity174 @entity173 , 35 , told the @entity171 : ‘ the @entity6 officials hand us over to the @entity4 police who let us go			1
‘ i do n’t know of anyone found on a lorry who has had their fingerprints checked			0
this encourages us to try again			0
’ @entity184 , a 29 - year - old @entity185 , said he was fingerprinted and photographed in @entity186 , @entity66 , after fleeing there by boat from the @entity190 coast three years ago			0
‘ they checked my identity thoroughly			0
i have tried to get through to @entity6 on a lorry every night for three months in @entity5			2
each time i am caught , the @entity6 take no details of who i am or ask which country i came from			2
i have not been fingerprinted by the @entity4 either			2
’ people - trafficking gangs smuggle at least 30 migrants every day to this country from @entity5 .			0

huge security downgrade gives illegal immigrants *endless* chances
@entity4 police free them allowing them to try to enter @entity6 again and again
critics describe loophole as ' disturbing ' and call for it to be closed
