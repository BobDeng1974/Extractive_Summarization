he 's the walking talking encyclopaedia of chocolate , well real chocolate that is , dubbed the real life ' @entity5 ' who has claimed to revoluntionise the way we think about , experience and indulge in chocolate			1
quirky @entity13 artisan chocolatier , @entity11 has devoted much of his life , to crafting the world 's most perfect blend and says what we now know as the delicious treat is in fact , not real chocolate			1
' what 's happened at the turn of the century , big companies have gobbled up producing chocolate and adding cheap ingredients like processed sugar , which is highly addictive , to put in the flavour what we think chocolate is about , ' he said			2
' ' people are surprised ( at the difference ) you see the awakening in their face , like it was for me			0
' @entity11 , who has been dubbed a mix between adventurer @entity37 and famous chef @entity55 , started his chocolate quest nearly two decades			1
he bought a 1,000 acre cacao farm in the rainforests of @entity35 , then created a custom - built factory to make chocolate in his own way with antique machines which are smaller and slower than their modern counterparts , but capture subtle notes and unique flavours			1
' chocolate was a fruit of the gods , it was used and drunk in many ceremonial occasions in @entity72 , it was special back then			2
' ' @entity73 is the goodness of chocolate			2
' to bring that back , the chocolate enthusiast says he goes to extreme lengths to get his beans which are the most important in making the best quality			1
' i 've just recently been to @entity83 and @entity84 to extend my search for new people , ' he said excitedly			0
' in eight days i met hundreds of farmers and i came back with a suitcase full of beans , that 's what you need to do to get the best of the best to make chocolate			2
' @entity11 , the chocolate enthusiast has been referred to as the @entity13 's ' @entity5 ' @entity11 ( pictured left and right ) prides himself on buying and producing all his chocolate , or ' bean to bar ' as he calls it , buying direct trade and at higher prices to local farmers to ensure quality is better @entity11 prides himself on buying and producing all his chocolate , or ' bean to bar ' as he calls it , buying direct trade and at higher prices to local farmers to ensure quality is better			1
' i tweek the fermentation if i need to , it allows me to manufacture the chocolate myself and develop the flavours			2
' @entity11 ( pictured ) loves to experiment with his chocolate and cacao in cooking including making bread with cacao and adding it to mashed potato or on top of @entity118 ' i make in small batches , around seven to 11 days it takes and that enables me to deliver the end product to the consumer at a reasonable price			1
' ' simple chocolate to bring out the flavour of the beans			2
if you do n't have good quality you need to add all these things , like sugar and additives			2
' one myth he seemed to have debunked is about dark chocolate			2
he says while most of us associate the dark variety with being bitter , he says that 's not the case			0
' dark chocolate is n't bitter , the reason is because the manufacturers are not using good quality beans and it 's been heavily roasted			1
' the chocolate nut likens real chocolate to a fine wine because each bean has a very different profile and tastes differently			1
' for example in @entity153 , they have got a very well know fruity profile which is quite unique and in the last century has developed into it 's own flavour through the soil and the climate , ' he said			0
in @entity35 where he first started his chocolate obsession , he describes the flavours as very interesting while in @entity162 he says the taste is predominantly coffee and has nutty notes			1
with most of @entity11 's chocolate range has only three ingredients - cacao , natural cacao butter and raw cane sugar , there 's no doubt his brown gold will delight fussy foodies and the health conscious			1
he believes the health benefits are backed up by research that real chocolate is good for you , full of essential vitamins and minerals for the body			1
' there 's a really interesting study in the @entity13 that chose my chocolate and found it was high in antioxidants which is good for cardiovascular , ' he said			0
' it supports my argument over processing that if you over process it , you kill it			0
' ' i think i tick a lot of the boxes , i like to keep things simple so you get instant gratification when you put it in your mouth			0
' admitting to a hot chocolate , or @entity199 every day , he says there 's many different ways you can use cacao in cooking			2
his ' @entity206 's ' range that has come to @entity207 and is available on our shelves at @entity210 likened to ' @entity5 ' ( pictured ) @entity11 is in @entity207 to launch his luxurious chocolates here ' it is an interesting condiment , in cooking its remarkable in savoury or sweet , ' he said			1
the chocolate phenomenon is now in @entity207 to launch his ' @entity206 ' range @entity11 has tried a variety of different dishes including cacao in bread which he dissolves into the dough			1
' it comes out a rick dark colour and when toasted brings out a nutty flavour			0
i add avocado and duck eggs on my toast as well as a mix of cacao and chilli			0
' ' you can also make gravy and it compliments the flavour or throw in when you are cooking rice , it 's a very soft flavour , ' he said			0
he 's also tried it in mashed potato , grated it on @entity118 and made a vegetarian @entity242 mushroom risotto			0
' it can lift something with a depth of flavour			0
' the @entity13 chocolate phenomenon is now in @entity207 for two weeks to officially launch his luxurious chocolate			1
' @entity206 ' which is stocked in the @entity13 and shipped to chocolate lovers all over the world , is now available on shelves here , with supermarket giant @entity210 stocking his products			1
' it 's a hugely great opportunity for me , it 's all about making chocolate and tasting it , i 'm on a mission and the mission is so big there 's never a point you reach it			0
' a small bar of the @entity84 flavoured delight will set you back about $ 4 for 50 grams while if you want indulgence , you could try the lime and chilli for around $ 13			0
' no chocolate like this in supermarkets , and once you 've tasted it the others will be spoilt because you 're eating something so good , ' he said			0
and when asked which flavour was his favourite he was tasked with a big decision , but said it was hard to choose referring to all his creations as his children			0
but did admit , ' i go through fazes			0
