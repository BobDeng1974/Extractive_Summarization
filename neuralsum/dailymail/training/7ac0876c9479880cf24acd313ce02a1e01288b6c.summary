@entity0 waited a considerable time before dismissing @entity2 , their close relationship making the @entity5 keep faith when supporters had long given up			1
but , with @entity10 in the relegation zone and 13 @entity13 games to go , the club ’s owner can not afford too much deliberation with his next decision			1
despite no little talent , the players look bereft of confidence and ideas			2
some are not pulling their weight			0
an instant injection of impetus is needed if @entity10 are to avert the impending disaster of relegation to the championship			1
@entity2 was sacked as @entity10 boss on wednesday after the club slipped into the bottom three @entity10 owner @entity0 kept faith with @entity2 due to his close relationship with the @entity31 step forward @entity32 ? ever since leaving @entity33 at the end of last season he has been the man near the top of every vacancy list			1
his availability in a sparse field of credible managers made him a candidate for the jobs at @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45			0
now he is the favourite to step into the @entity48 hotseat			2
his @entity13 experience amounts to just five months in charge at @entity33 , but he left @entity51 with the highest win ratio ( 59 per cent ) of any manager at the club in the @entity13 era			1
he was a compelling character and forceful personality , unafraid to speak his mind to a formidable boss in @entity59			2
@entity10 need a spark to lift the mood and generate a turnaround in results			1
judging from his time in north @entity66 , @entity64 would provide that			0
@entity10 are in need of a major lift after a season of struggle and inability to find the net this campaign former @entity33 boss @entity32 could be the man to lift the mood and change results at @entity48 @entity2 , understandably tired after three seasons of continual struggle , had resorted to using clichés when talking about the challenge ahead for @entity10			1
’ 13 cup finals , ’ he said of the remaining @entity13 matches			0
it was the same term he used last season			0
the squad need to hear a different voice , an opinion that will compel and inspire			0
tactically too , their play has been muddled			0
the switch from direct football to a possession - based game seemed like a sensible plan for long - term stability but has resulted in tedious fare			0
just 12 goals in 25 games is a statistic that even those averse to data crunching can comprehend as terminal			0
@entity32 displayed at @entity33 his ability to generate a lift in results and a good style , improving players and handing debuts to younger talents			1
@entity33 trio @entity106 ( left ) , @entity107 and @entity108 ( right ) were handed starts under @entity32 he does not yet have the @entity111 coaching qualification required by the @entity13 but has been working towards it with the @entity113 and that should satisfy the authorities			1
@entity116 has his @entity118 and @entity119 qualifications			0
the problem has come in each of his rumoured reprisals when discussions turn to wages			0
at @entity43 last summer , he looked on course for the job until demanding £ 2.5million a year , plus sizeable packages for his assistants			0
a man who knows his worth , you might say			2
and that is fair enough			0
still being paid by @entity33 as part of his severance package , @entity32 does not have to accept less than what he feels is his value			1
@entity32 is still being paid by @entity33 and has been linked to a host of vacancies since his departure his reunion with @entity140 and @entity141 at @entity45 hit the buffers in similar circumstances , though , a job that seemed tailor made			1
@entity10 , with its history and financial stability , represents a better long - term bet – and there is a growing sense @entity32 needs to take an opportunity before it is too late			1
for the right man , @entity0 will find the necessary funds			2
desperate to avoid relegation to the @entity155 , and the disaster that would spell for his ambitions to sell the club , he is willing to pay well to get that bounce that will see @entity10 above the dreaded dotted line come may			1
@entity32 was expected to link up once more with @entity161 ( left ) at @entity45 but the move did n't come off whether he feels this is @entity32 remains to be seen			1
ideally , he would turn to a manager well - versed in steering sides clear of danger			0
but @entity167 has already pitched up in the midlands and is doing just fine at @entity43			0
@entity32 would be a gamble given his inexperience in these waters , but short - term at least , he may represent the best out there			1
long - term , @entity10 are in serious need of lasting change , they need to conduct a proper search of candidates , stage an in - depth recruitment policy			2
right now , though , there is not time for that			0
right now , @entity32 is available .			2

@entity32 is the *bookmakers* favourite to take over at @entity10
@entity2 was sacked after @entity10 dropped into the bottom three
former @entity33 boss @entity32 could be the man to lift @entity10
