@entity0 arrived at his press conference on thursday apologising for still being in what he called his ' work clothes '			1
that , however , transpired to the least of his worries			0
soon after , he was embroiled in what we can politely describe as a lively exchange about the nature of his relationship with his assistant @entity13			2
pictures of a rather underwhelmed @entity13 at @entity15 on wednesday and some quotes from his old friend @entity17 had given weight earlier in the day to some recent chatter about the @entity22 icon 's thoughts on @entity24 's style of play and indeed his own future			1
@entity0 was not best pleased after his relationship with @entity13 was questioned @entity13 did not respond to @entity24 's in - your - face celebrations after @entity22 's late win against @entity31 the @entity22 boss gave a tetchy press conference ahead of monday 's @entity35 clash with @entity36 and then there was the @entity39 issue			1
caught on film spitting towards the ground during a clash with @entity31 centre forward @entity44 , the @entity22 central defender now stands accused – rightly or wrongly - of one of the most frowned upon acts in sport			1
all in all , it was another challenging day at the office for @entity22 's manager			1
no wonder his mood was rather spiky			0
' no , we have a very bad relationship , ' said @entity24 of @entity13 , rather sarcastically			2
' i 'm very irritated because of this question			0
' everyone can see we have a very good relationship and work very hard together , not only @entity13 but all the staff and players			2
' this [ your question ] is a way of suggesting things			0
' so now i am very irritated and i take my message against the media			0
' i think 90 per cent [ of everything you say ] is not happening			0
' @entity24 and @entity13 share their views during the @entity73 clash with the @entity74 on wednesday @entity76 wheels away after scoring a late winner to keep @entity22 in the chase for a top four finish the former @entity81 manager laughs from the dugout at @entity15 while his no 2 remains stony faced @entity13 ( 2nd left ) did not appear to join in his manager 's celebrations after @entity22 's late victory at @entity31 images of @entity13 failing to join @entity24 's celebrations after @entity76 's 89th minute goal at @entity91 on wednesday were certainly peculiar			1
so , too , were quotes from @entity17 on tv before kick - off			1
' there 's no doubt , he had that little taste of it for the last three weeks of last year and he definitely wants to be a manager , ' @entity17 told @entity100			1
' you can see that			0
over the next two or three years , will he have the patience to be a no 2 for that long ? i 'm not sure he will			2
' @entity13 is reportedly angry after former team - mate @entity17 ( right ) questioned his contentment at @entity22 @entity13 is understood to have been non-plussed by @entity108 ' style of play at @entity22 the @entity22 icon took charge at @entity112 for the final games of last season following @entity108 ' sacking @entity13 and @entity17 worked together at @entity22 when the former was handed the reins last season in the wake of @entity108 ' sacking			1
former team - mates , they know each other very well			1
nevertheless , it is understood that @entity13 views his friend 's comments as unhelpful and is furious that anyone should voice doubts about his relationship with @entity24			1
it is not hard to wonder , though , what @entity13 does make of the @entity132 coach 's style			1
@entity13 grew frustrated at @entity108 ' reluctance to play on the front foot last season and immediately sought to change it during his spell as interim manager last april and may			1
@entity13 instinctively went back to what he emotively called ' the @entity22 way '			1
so have things improved that much this season ? it is hard to say that they have			0
for now , though , @entity22 fans will listen to @entity24 's words and learn of @entity13 ' irritation and perhaps be soothed			1
if performances pick up - starting with a home @entity35 tie with @entity36 on monday - then the subject will be allowed to melt away			1
@entity22 defender @entity39 ( left ) and @entity44 have been charged with spitting during the game ‘ having woken up this morning i am shocked to have seen the media coverage from last night ’s match			1
i would like to make it clear that i did not spit at @entity44			2
‘ i was totally unaware of any spitting incident and had assumed that the issue at the time was with the challenge and his attempted retaliation to the tackle from the floor			0
during the game @entity44 and i spoke about the incident and it is clear by my reaction in the television footage that i was totally surprised by any suggestion of spitting			2
‘ it is not in my character or in my nature to spit at anybody nor is it something i have ever done or would ever do			2
it is certainly not something that i did last night			0
’ the games he @entity176 : @entity36 ( h ) , monday ; @entity178 ( h ) , march 15 ; @entity180 ( a ) , march 22 ; @entity181 ( h ) , april 4 ; @entity183 ( h ) april 12 ; @entity185 ( a ) april 18			2
@entity39 and @entity44 were both caught on camera appearing to spit at each other on wednesday night ‘ i have apologies to make to a lot of people today			1
firstly to my team - mates and to our supporters , secondly to @entity39 , and thirdly to every football fan who saw the incident between myself and @entity39			1
‘ i reacted to something i found very unpleasant			0
sometimes it is hard not to react , particularly in the heat of the moment			0
i have always tried hard to be a positive role model , especially for our young fans , and yesterday i let you down			0
‘ i hope children out there playing football for their clubs and schools this weekend will know better than to retaliate when they are angry			0
perhaps when they see the problem it now causes me and my team they will be able to learn from my mistake , not copy it			2
’ the games he ’ll miss for @entity31 : @entity216 ( a ) , march 15 ; @entity36 ( h ) , march 21 ; @entity218 ( a ) , april 5 ; @entity180 ( a ) , april 13 ; @entity178 ( h ) , april 19 ; @entity220 ( h ) , april 25 ; @entity222 ( a ) , may 2			1
@entity44 has accepted a possible seven - game ban while @entity39 has until 6pm on friday february 6 to respond as for @entity39 , he will clearly tell the @entity35 that he did n't mean to spit at @entity224 on wednesday but may still be fortunate to escape a ban of six games			1
footage would appear to be inconclusive and it is easy to sympathise with the @entity230 's claim in a statement on thursday that he was not spitting at his opponent			0
his manager clearly believes him , too , but whether the @entity35 will feel they can prove the case against one player - @entity44 - and not the other will perhaps worry @entity24 as he contemplates playing much of the remainder of the season without his centre half			1
' of course i 've spoken with @entity39 , ' said the @entity22 manager			1
' it is like what i said in the press conference after match that he was not aware he was spitting			0
' and when he was spitting on the ground , maybe it 's a natural thing from a human being			0
' i think it was not his intention and that i said already			0
' i can not imagine that @entity39 could do that			2
' and he has said this also so i believe him			0
' so for me the matter has done			0
' @entity22 will renew their rivalry with @entity36 when @entity24 takes on @entity256 in the @entity35 quarter - final with monday 's game at @entity112 so important to @entity22 in terms of their chances of not only winning a trophy but also of finding the required confidence to take in to some tough @entity73 fixtures , @entity24 may have hoped for a rather less eventful build - up			1
amid it all , at least he can cling to results			0
@entity22 remain fourth in the @entity73 and , somehow , on course for the @entity269 qualification that was stated as a pre-requisite at the start of the season			2
criticism has been a constant companion throughout his time in @entity276 and , indeed , during previous spells in @entity81 and @entity278			0
it is partly because of this that it was surprising to see him so irked			0
he is usually a little more phlegmatic			0
one imagines that passage to the last four of the @entity35 on monday night would put much of it right .			2

@entity13 did not celebrate @entity22 's 1 - 0 win at @entity31
@entity17 hinted his former team - mate was not happy at being no 2
@entity0 reacted angrily to suggestions of a problem between pair
