but one in three @entity12 hotel guests are too polite to leave the chores to hotel staff and admitted making the bed , tidying up and washing up tea cups before checking out of their rooms			1
and 10 per cent of @entity3 said they would try to make a maid ’s life easier by avoiding wearing the hotel robe or using the tea making facilities			1
in a survey done by @entity26 some @entity12 hotel guests said they would rather avoid face - to - face interaction with hotel staff if there is a problem			1
younger people in particular prefer not to trouble hotel workers , and 73 per cent would rather deal with a problem themselves than ask for help			0
and 15 per cent said if they forgot directions given to them by the concierge they would rather stride off in the direction they thought they had been told , than ask a second time			0
a third of @entity12 hotel guests said they would prefer to ask for help over the phone , or using a mobile or tablet app than speak to hotel staff in person			2
other trends which emerged included guests carrying their own bags to avoid troubling the porter , not asking the concierge for help and guests apologising for things that are not their fault			0
@entity58 , of @entity26 , said : ‘ the research really supports the classic @entity12 stereotype of a culture that is too polite to ask for help , going to lengths to avoid putting others out and creating more work for hotel staff			1
no trouble : many @entity12 guests also carry their own bags to avoid troubling the porter and are reluctant to ask the concierge for help ‘ while some of the findings reveal humorous and quirky behaviour traits , hotels can really help to make the guest experience more enjoyable by offering alternative platforms of communication			2
‘ this is an indication that not only do hotel guests shy away from direct confrontation with hotel staff , they are also adopting and adapting to new forms of communication when it comes to obtaining information			0
‘ the importance of mobile and tablet apps are continuing to grow , as hotel goers look to embrace the new technology available , to save them time and money			0
‘ this is a feature that hoteliers should also look to embrace to provide the best all - round experience for their guests			0
