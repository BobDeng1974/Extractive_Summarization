@entity1 's recovery from a persistent groin injury remains a distant prospect and the wrecking - ball centre is racing to be fit to play any further rugby this season			1
the 23 - year - old has not played since being forced off during @entity10 ’s @entity9 tie against @entity11 last october			1
the initial prognosis was that he would be sidelined for six to eight weeks , but that was soon exposed as wishful thinking			0
a series of target dates for his comeback have come and gone , and now it appears @entity19 wo n’t resurface until the last month of the season — if at all			1
@entity1 has not featured since injuring his groin playing for @entity10 back in october the @entity23 centre is in a race against time to be fit for the @entity26 , starting in september @entity27 understands he is setting his sights on playing four or five games for the @entity10 in late april and may , but only time will tell if that ambition can be realised			1
@entity23 were already resigned to being without their midfield colossus for the entire @entity36 campaign , but having had @entity1 in camp to oversee his rehabilitation , the management are aware that he is not close to being match - ready			1
the latest bulletin represented another setback in an alarmingly drawn - out recovery			0
‘ he is making good progress and is doing straight line running , but he still has some way to go , ’ said head coach @entity43 ahead of another @entity45 encounter which will not feature @entity1			1
‘ i think he ’ll come good at the end of the season			0
certainly @entity52 ( physio ) has done a good job with him , but it ’s not in the near future			0
by the end of the season he ’ll be back playing			0
‘ it is about making sure his groin and the healing around it is strong enough to cope with the forces he puts through it			2
he is a powerful man and he needs to make sure the groin has healed sufficiently			0
it is a step - by - step process to make sure he does not re-injure it , so that is why people are very cautious			0
’ @entity10 and @entity23 are keen to build their attacking game around @entity1 ’s forceful ball - carrying but the pattern in the last two years has been for longer spells injured than fit			1
he has made only four appearances for the @entity10 this season , following a modest tally of 10 last season in a campaign disrupted by a prolonged recovery from a pectoral injury			1
@entity1 is a destructive figure but when he breaks down it takes a long time for his powerful body to heal			2
in early december , his club ’s director of rugby , @entity84 , predicted an imminent return and outlined just what @entity10 and @entity23 were missing			1
‘ @entity1 should be back by the end of december , ’ he said at the time			2
‘ in the modern game you ’ve got to be able to dent the line of the opposition — you need physicality and @entity1 gives you that			2
he has been huge for @entity23			2
the midfield is the biggest problem @entity23 have and @entity1 gives you that one position solved			1
’ @entity1 could make a return in the final month of the season but his @entity26 place is in jeopardy @entity1 has struggled with injury over the past two seasons and has only played nine tests since 2012 worryingly for @entity109 and his assistants , uncertainty over @entity1 ’s ability to withstand the rigours of his profession remains part of the problem			1
in 2012 , he played 10 times for his country , culminating in a devastating contribution to the record win over the @entity117 at @entity118			0
since then he has made only nine test appearances , four of them as a replacement and one of those for the @entity122 on a tour where his impact was undermined by yet another injury			0
despite attempts to alleviate his condition using prolotherapy — involving injections of a sugar solution into the bone — it is thought that a recent improvement has been brought about by intensive physiotherapy			0
@entity10 will hope his best - case scenario of a return for the business end of the season ignites their @entity140 title challenge , while @entity23 will want @entity1 to join their initial @entity26 training squad in june , ready to play a full , active part			1
@entity23 head coach @entity43 confirmed @entity1 is no closer to making a return @entity43 oversees training as his side prepare to face @entity147 in the @entity36 on saturday how @entity23 will line up against @entity147 at @entity118 on saturday he remains the most potent weapon in the team ’s back - line , when available			1
he can splinter the best defences and has even spooked the @entity117 with his explosive exploits in midfield			0
that continues to be the primary area of concern for @entity109 despite the advances made by @entity158 during this championship , to the extent that @entity161 and @entity162 have been under close scrutiny in camp this week			0
that pair are seen as @entity26 contenders			0
@entity168 appears to be running out of chances to prove his test credentials at 12 , @entity167 is striving to claim that position and @entity172 appears to have been tried and discarded			0
@entity43 has said @entity1 will be considered at inside centre , if that is the position to fill , while he was even shunted out to the wing in @entity176 last june			1
whatever the number on his back , @entity23 will surely pick him , but by now they would ideally have spent ample time fine - tuning their centre combination			2
instead , if @entity1 is eventually cleared for a comeback , there will be a maximum of three pre- tournament friendlies to reintegrate him before the main event comes around .			2

@entity1 has not played since october after injuring groin for @entity10
@entity23 centre has missed a series of target dates for making a retuern
@entity1 is not likely to feature again until the last month of the season
@entity43 confirmed @entity1 is not close to a return yet
@entity1 has been hampered by injuries in the last two season
