challenges : dr @entity1 , pictured before she returned to @entity2 to treat @entity4 patients @entity6 @entity4 doctor @entity5 made headlines when she returned to @entity2 despite previously fearing she had contracted the disease			1
now the 32 - year - old , who quarantined herself in her @entity11 flat for three weeks , has sent back a diary which lays bare the chaos and confusion which treating the outbreak involves			1
more than 7,500 people have died of @entity4 in @entity17 since the disease broke out in march this year , and almost 20,000 people have been infected			1
the vast majority of infections have been in @entity21 , @entity2 and @entity22 , and @entity2 has had the worst death toll at almost half the victims			1
however , case rates have been declining in @entity2 since the middle of last month according to the @entity27 , which is hopeful of its demise			1
despite the grim figures , dr @entity5 is surprisingly optimistic - and insists the prospect of the disease being wiped out in @entity2 in 2015 is a reality			1
december 14 there has recently been a suspect case in @entity35 , who unfortunately despite many agencies ' best efforts , including our own , has disappeared and refused to be tested for @entity4 ( @entity4 )			1
we arranged for his transport to the @entity43 ( @entity43 ) in @entity44 , but he declined to go			2
he then stopped answering his phone and we were no longer able to trace him as he had left the village and disappeared somewhere in @entity44			2
this makes the decision to remove the team difficult			2
if he was a confirmed case he may well have infected other people in the town as he also refused to fully isolate himself			2
however if he was not a case then we are retaining our team in a very challenging environment for several weeks longer than needed			1
upbeat : dr @entity5 with a patient and a colleague in @entity2 , where she tackles more than just disease in the field : the @entity4 doctor with colleague @entity63 at one of many @entity64 we eventually manage to get hold of him and he hangs up the phone on me when i offer to arrange an ambulance to take him to get a blood test done			1
we manage to determine though from community leaders that he seems much better and so it is less likely he has @entity4			1
we make a decision to pull our team out but regularly monitor the situation			2
december 15 - 18 over the course of the next few days i am largely based in the office in @entity80			1
i hear news of a suspect case in @entity83			2
this is concerning as @entity83 has just passed 42 days clear of any cases of @entity4			1
the potential case lives very close to the border with @entity21 and @entity22 and there is concern he has travelled there			2
fortunately the case turns out to be a false alarm			2
front line : dr @entity5 in protective clothing december 19 we are preparing to travel to @entity97 tomorrow for the official opening of our @entity99 ( @entity64 ) when we learn that several of our staff have been in a car accident			1
they were driving to @entity80 in convoy from our base in @entity105 , @entity106			2
unfortunately one of the vehicles has been in a head - on collision with another vehicle			1
we learn that four of our staff are injured , two of them severely injured			2
they are at a small health centre in a village in the middle of the jungle			2
the nearest town is over an hour 's drive on very poor roads			2
one of our staff members is unconscious , the other is unable to move her neck and has chest injuries			0
we are unable to get any further information			0
i am concerned that both of them could have injuries to their necks and that if they are not immobilised prior to transfer they could be permanently paralysed if they are moved			0
we attempt to request a helicopter but we are told they are not allowed to transport @entity2			1
if this was one of my @entity136 or @entity6 colleagues , there would be no hesitation to use one of the five helicopters currently sitting on the tarmac at the airport			1
but somehow because they are @entity2 , they are not entitled to the same treatment i would be			1
to me they are my colleagues , whether they are @entity2 , @entity136 or @entity6 , and i will do my best for them however i can			1
with tears in my eyes i make the decision not to move them that night			1
it is a horrible decision to make			0
the health centre they are in has no facilities , but i understand they are both relatively stable			0
my concern that i could do them more damage by requesting they be moved by people inexperienced in manual handling			0
i go to bed that night praying it was not the wrong decision			0
waiting game : @entity166 helicopters are in short supply , and getting one is far from guaranteed december 20 it is a miracle we had a @entity166 helicopter scheduled today to take us to @entity97			1
this has enabled us to re-schedule this helicopter to take us to @entity173 to collect my colleagues instead			0
we arrive in @entity175 and the pilots tell us they will wait for us for a maximum of three hours			0
it is an hours drive to @entity179 , the village where my colleagues are			0
we race along the dirt track trying to save as much time as possible			0
we know that time will be short when we arrive to immobilise them both and get them into the back of our land cruiser			0
i do n't have everything i need , but i at least have two neck collars to stabilise their necks and two decent combat stretchers			0
it is the best i can do			0
we leave @entity179 with only 50 minutes until the helicopter will leave and once again race along the dirt track			0
this time the driver tries to be even more cautious about avoiding the pot holes , after all we have two colleagues on stretchers in the back of our land cruiser with the sideways fitted seats pushed upwards out of the way			0
we make it back to the helicopter 10 minutes late , but fortunately they have waited for us			0
x-rays confirm i was right to have been concerned for one of my colleagues			0
fortunately both of them do well and are discharged home from hospital a few days later			0
finally i am able to get some time off			0
it has been three weeks with no day off and two medical evacuations , which are pretty exhausting in the current context			1
on sunday evening we go carol singing and take some baked items to the neighbouring houses on the compound			0
december 22 we are taking over a transit centre that has been converted following the closure of the @entity43 in @entity219			0
a transit centre is similar to a @entity64 but patients will only remain for a few days until we have determined if they have a positive test for @entity4 or not			1
i visit the facility today but unfortunately there is a lot more work to do on the lay out and the water source so we will not be opening the facility before @entity230 as we had hoped			0
rescue : a new care centre in @entity97 , whose opening was partly marred by a car crash involving the staff home turf : the 32 - year - old doctor outside @entity239 in @entity240 , where she normally works december 23 today i spend time responding to emails and trying to resolve issues regarding staff contracts			1
i then attend a meeting regarding the @entity245 that are being constructed by @entity246 , of which we will take over the coordination of three facilities when they are completed in january			0
december 24 i spend a part of the day baking cookies to take to the medical staff at the medical facility set up by the @entity254 for @entity2 and international health care workers who contract @entity4			1
they had kindly lent us two combat stretchers last week when we evacuated my two colleagues and so we wanted to thank them and wish them a @entity261			1
dr @entity5 said : ' an @entity4 - free @entity2 really could be a possibility in a few months ' time ' in the evening we go out for a team meal that the charity @entity265 has kindly offered to pay for			1
it is a moment of normality amidst the chaos where we all dress up and feel relatively smart for the first time in weeks			1
december 25 whilst we will continue to work we do ensure the entire team takes the day off today			0
the only staff working are the health care workers who are staffing our two functioning @entity245			0
our international team share brunch together			0
then we do a gift exchange and go for a swim in the ocean			2
the obligatory drone of chinooks and @entity282 helicopters throughout the day reminds us of the ongoing battle we find ourselves in			2
december 26 it is back to work today but as there are not many meetings this week and many people are not working there is a limit to what can be done			0
i am hoping to make these few days a little bit easier and to complete all the formal documentation i have been unable to do due to all of my other responsibilities over the last few weeks			2
i remain hopeful that we will see the end of @entity4 in @entity2 in the next few months			1
numbers continue to remain down , although there was a small increase in cases again last week			0
as long as there is no peak following the @entity261 period , an @entity4 - free @entity2 really could be a possibility in a few months ' time			1
then more attention can be focused on @entity22 and @entity21			0
here is to a 2015 where the largest @entity4 epidemic in history is brought to an end .			1

dr @entity1 quarantined herself at @entity11 flat for 3 weeks
she then returned to the *stricken* country after getting the all - clear
now her diary tells of chaos and tears of dealing with the outbreak
@entity261 was a swim on the beach with helicopters flying *overhead*
despite *setbacks* , she is hopeful @entity2 will become @entity4 - free in 2015
