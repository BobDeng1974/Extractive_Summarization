by @entity0 published : 06:08 est , 2 january 2013 updated : 13:35 est , 6 january 2013 a woman who suffered five miscarriages in as many years has finally had her dream of a perfect family come true , after taking a daily aspirin			1
nurse @entity6 longed for a second child to complete her family but suffered a tragic series of miscarriages			1
doctors initially carried out a series of tests on the 33 - year - old but were unable to find why she could not reach full term , before she took a colleague 's advice about taking aspirin and gave birth to her first child , son @entity21 two years ago			1
she then went through a further three miscarriages trying for a second child , before she remembered the daily tablet she had taken during her first pregnancy			1
happy family : mrs @entity6 has finally given birth to her second child , daughter @entity30 ( left ) to complete the family she had always wished for with son @entity21 and husband @entity32 ( right ) and to her surprise , doctors told her she had stumbled across the answer to her problems , as they diagnosed her with a blood clotting condition called antiphospholipid syndrome			1
the breakthrough meant mrs @entity6 and husband @entity32 , 34 , were finally able to make it to full term with a second child , @entity30 , thanks to the over-the - counter painkiller			1
the happy mother - of - two , who now works as a school nurse , said : ' i just kept thinking why - i am not a smoker and i did not drink so i could not understand why i kept having miscarriages			1
' i could not face working on the maternity ward again after going through so many miscarriages			2
' i had to take a big drop in pay and hours to move job , but i just could not face the heartbreak ' the only way @entity32 and i could deal with the pain of a miscarriage was to try and get pregnant again			0
' we never wanted @entity21 to be an only child			0
' mother and son : mrs @entity6 gave birth to her first child , son @entity21 , after taking a daily aspirin following a colleague 's recommendation			1
on holiday : mrs @entity6 's husband @entity32 with the couple 's first child @entity21 doctors warn against self - diagnosing and taking aspirin during pregnancy			1
mrs @entity6 has now called for all women with a history of @entity76 to have tests for antiphospholipid syndrome , also known as @entity80 syndrome or sticky blood			1
following her fifth miscarriage mrs @entity6 underwent several tests as doctors desperately tried to find out what was causing her to miscarry			1
she was sent to @entity86 where she was diagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome - a blood clotting disorder which can result in miscarriage or stillbirth			1
condition : mrs @entity6 was diagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome after she gave birth to @entity21 , pictured , and was put on a daily dose of aspirin before the birth of @entity97 four days after her diagnosis @entity98 found out she was pregnant again			1
doctors put her on blood thinning drug @entity101 and she also took an aspirin every day as she had also done with @entity21			1
in june this year @entity30 was born five weeks prematurely , but healthily			2
she fears thousands of other women could be suffering the same pain as her when they already have the cure sat in their bathroom cupboard			2
she said : ' i told all the doctors i was taking the aspirin and they said it would not do any harm			2
' i was going to stop taking it after the 12 week scan , but i was too scared to stop			0
' later the doctor said that @entity21 's birth was down to the aspirin			2
' we were quite tearful when we got the test results back because the doctor said if i had stopped taking the aspirin i would never have given birth to @entity21 and because it was such a relief to find out we had been doing the right things			2
' just before i fell pregnant with @entity97 it was getting to the point where we would have had to give up hope , because it was all getting too painful			0
' i worked with people who had miscarriages and i had never heard of antiphospholipid syndrome , which shows how rare it is			0
' people need to be more aware of this condition			0
a £ 35 blood test could end the agony of unexplained recurrent miscarriage			0
' when i am out with the double pushchair people always say " you are lucky to have one of each " , but i think if only they knew what we had been through to get them			0
' it is unnecessary to take aspirin in a normal pregnancy , says consultant gynaecologist @entity144 , of @entity146 's @entity145			2
in fact , it 's important not to self - medicate at all , and see your gp if you have any health concerns			2
the reason why aspirin is recommended for women such as @entity98 is because she has a disease that can cause abnormal blood clotting			1
these clots can stop the blood flow between mother and baby through the placenta			0
aspirin is known for its anti-clotting properties – it basically thins the blood – and so in women with this condition , it can help prevent the clots that cause a miscarriage from forming			1
it may also aid blood flow to the placenta			0
antiphospholipid syndrome , also known as sticky blood or @entity80 syndrome , accounts for as many as one in five cases of recurrent miscarriage			0
women who have suffered three or more unexplained miscarriages should ask their gp to have a test for @entity80 syndrome			0
treatment is simple and aimed at preventing the formation of clots			0
those who test positive are usually given a daily low dose of 75mg aspirin ( which is about one quarter of an adult aspirin tablet ) combined with another prescription blood thinner , heparin			1
the combination can reduce the risk of miscarriage in women with @entity196 by around 50 per cent			0
antiphospholipid syndrome can also cause deep vein thrombosis , stroke or a heart attack			0
the medicine cabinet @entity201 's proving to be a remarkable drug @entity205 aspirin , the staple of every medicine cabinet , is proving to be a remarkable drug			2
originally derived from willow bark , but now synthetically made , it ’s been used as a painkiller for years			0
it ’s also widely taken by people with cardiovascular disease or at risk of stroke due to its ability to cut the risk of blood clots			0
most recently , research published last week in @entity222 found taking a daily low - dose aspirin for five years cut cancer death risk by 37 per cent			1
the drug appeared to stop the disease spreading and to ward off certain types of cancer , such as colon and breast .			0
