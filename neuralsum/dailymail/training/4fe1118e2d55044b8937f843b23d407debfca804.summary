for @entity0 , a pensioner from @entity1 , a single visit to a nudist party with her husband @entity4 was all it took to convince her to embrace the lifestyle for herself			1
' i had a bad body image			1
i ’d had an operation and i ’ve got what i think is a huge scar and a disfiguring scar , and @entity4 took me along to a nature swim , ' she remembers			1
' and , you know , i do n’t notice it anymore			0
it gives you lots of confidence			0
you know i am who i am , and you can see my life on my face but you can also see the life on my body			2
' naked ambition : @entity0 , third from left , says that becoming a nudist has made her feel happier with her physique @entity0 is one of a growing number of @entity32 people to embrace a nudist - or naturist - lifestyle and now lives in the @entity32 's second biggest naked community , @entity35			1
located close to @entity36 in the village of @entity38 , the 12 acre ' community ' was founded in 1929 by @entity35 and his wife @entity40 in a stretch of woodland as a retreat for themselves and their friends			1
among them was @entity48 , a @entity57 academic and founder of the @entity51 , a neo-pagan group , and his friend , @entity53 , the father of modern @entity54 who established his first coven at the @entity38 site			1
while @entity54 plays little part in modern life at @entity35 , nudity and a communal lifestyle most certainly does			1
friendly : @entity0 and her husband live at @entity35 , a naturist community located just outside @entity36 ' it 's basically a normal life , ' explains @entity0			1
' my neighbours are lots of different ages and some were even born here			0
' it 's just a small community and very much a community where everybody gets to know everyone else			2
' so established is the community , even delivery drivers dropping off @entity78 or @entity79 deliveries have become a regular part of life at @entity35			1
' everybody delivers to us , ' adds @entity0			1
' our deliverymen are usually the same ones so there 's never a problem			0
quite often we ask them to take their clothes off at the gate ! ' for @entity0 herself , her journey to life at @entity35 when her husband , a naturist himself , came up with a drastic solution to her body image woes			1
miserable about a huge scar left on her torso following an operation , her husband @entity4 decided to cheer her up by taking her along to a naturist event			1
amazingly , she agreed to go and says she has n't looked back since			2
' i had had surgery and was n't confident , ' she remembers			0
rural : the beautiful @entity1 countryside is home to @entity35 which appears in a new documentary lifestyle : presenter @entity112 goes nude at @entity35 after meeting @entity0 and her friends ' i did n't like undressing in front of him or anyone else so we decided to do something about it			1
in the end , it proved very quick and easy way to cure it and no therapy needed			2
' now the couple call @entity35 home and regularly go naked , although as @entity0 points out , being a naturist does n't necessarily mean being nude all the time			1
' naturists or nudists generally prefer to be without clothes if it 's warm enough , ' she explains			0
' if it 's cold , we put clothes on , although i 'd still call myself a naturist			2
' if a cricketer goes on a gay pride march in @entity136 , is he still a cricketer ? of course he is , so it 's the same thing for me			0
' unlike more extreme members of the community , @entity0 also says she puts on clothes when doing things like gardening in order to avoid ending up with scratches in delicate areas			1
' i put trousers on if i 'm gardening , ' she laughs			0
' if i 'm digging a hole , i 'll put my wellies on ! if i 'm doing a barbie , i 'll put an apron on ! ' she also laughs off the idea of people becoming aroused in a naturist environment , saying it rarely happens at @entity35			1
' it [ unscheduled arousal ] very rarely happens , ' she explains			0
' clothes are more erotic			0
if you 're naked , it 's not particularly arousing			0
' the naked body does n't seem to be as arousing as one in a bikini or negligee			2
if someone does get an erection , they 're usually very discreet about it			0
most people carry a towel to sit on , so they just wrap that round their waist			0
' the odd embarrassing moment notwithstanding , @entity0 says @entity35 is her little haven and says anyone who thinks naturism is weird should come and give it a try			1
' [ critics ] can think what they like - for us , this is normal , ' she reveals			0
' they should come and give it a go or just come and visit to see what it 's like			0
' it really is a little haven			0
it 's quiet and calm , although we do like the odd party just like anyone else			0
' she 's also come to accept her body for what it is and says she 's happier than ever			2
' [ @entity194 ] made me realise that i look the same as everyone else - just a different shape , ' she explains			0
' i 'm here [ at @entity35 ] because i 'm comfortable , happy and right now , this is where i belong			2
' @entity0 appears on outsiders with @entity112 , friday night at 10pm on the @entity200			2
