it takes a click , and then the app asks for a password			0
the child turns to a parent , who punches it in			0
but , according to the @entity6 complaint , @entity2 did not always make it clear that they were buying something			1
parents also were not told that entering the password started a 15 - minute clock during which kids could make unlimited purchases without any further action by an adult , the agency said			0

in the @entity6 case , the $ 32.5 million payout is a minimum			0
as part of the settlement , @entity2 must pay full refunds to consumers for kids ' unauthorized purchases , so that figure could climb			2

thousands of complaints received of payments of up to $ 2,600
