@entity2 wants more female choreographers for her company , after saying that because of the many male directors in dance , ‘ like in porn , it shapes the way you look at things ’			1
the 39 - year - old dancer and director said that relationships are often shown from a male perspective and that she wants to see certain issues ‘ approached by women on stage ’			1
miss @entity2 said that men often approach dance choreography in a ‘ more physical ’ way by starting with the steps , rather than women who often begin with the ‘ emotional landscape ’			2
she told @entity32 : ‘ female sensitivity is different			2
and there are issues that i want to see on stage approached by women			2
' very often we see relationships approached from a male perspective			1
‘ like in porn , it shapes the way you look at things			0
it tends to be a more physical approach			0
men start with the steps			0
i find women start with the emotional landscape			0
‘ they say , “ this is the situation , let ’s find a language for it ”			0
with men , it tends to be , “ this is the language ” , and then you try to work out the situation through the steps			0
’ she added that the lack of female choreographers is partially down to women taking breaks to have children and that they are ‘ not aggressive in self - promotion ’			1
thoughts : @entity7 artistic director @entity2 said that men often approach dance in a ' more physical ' way by starting with the steps , rather than women who often begin with the ' emotional landscape ' no major new works by female choreographers have been commissioned by the @entity69 in 14 years - and the @entity7 last took one on 11 years ago , reported the @entity71			1
but works by young female choreographers have been featured by both companies on tours and for performances not on the main stages			2
for example , a fusion of ballet and contemporary dance was co-choreographed for a tour this year by @entity83 of the @entity7 , with @entity84 from @entity86 ’s @entity85 .			0

@entity2 , 39 , wants more female choreographers for her company
