by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 16:13 est , 19 december 2012 updated : 03:05 est , 20 december 2012 an elderly baroness whose former gardener claimed he was left deaf by years spent mowing grass on her country estate has successfully fought off his legal battle for £ 25,000 compensation			1
@entity8 , 66 , claimed he was deafened by the din of his power tools while tending to the @entity12 estate , home to @entity14 , @entity15 , widow of @entity17 holder and former @entity19 mp @entity18			1
mr @entity8 , who looked after the grounds of the £ 700,000 home for almost 20 years after being hired by @entity21 , had launched legal action seeking damages for ‘ noise induced deafness ’			1

she has won a legal battle with her former gardener over claims his work damaged his hearing he claimed his intrusive tinnitus resulted from years of using lawn mowers , chainsaws , strimmers and other power tools in his job and that the noise prevented him from watching tv and made normal conversation with his wife impossible			1
however , his case , finally hit the buffers yesterday as three top judges at the @entity50 ruled that he had left it too late to sue and that @entity15 would not have a fair chance of defending herself due to the delay			2
the case had initially been thrown out by a county court judge last year on the same grounds			0
last night the 90 - year - old widow , who said she had felt betrayed by the noise claim , welcomed the ruling saying that ' justice has been done '			1

file picture she said : ‘ the court has , for the second time , thrown out this frivolous case			0
’ ‘ i ’m very pleased but i always knew what the outcome would be - i knew he would never win			0
the whole thing was farcical			0
‘ i feel nothing for that man , and now i never have to think about him again			0
’ lord @entity79 , sitting with @entity77 and @entity78 , said the legal deadline for launching personal injury compensation cases had expired four years before mr @entity8 lodged his claim in july 2008 and it would not be fair on @entity15 to extend that time limit			1
lord @entity21 , formerly colonel sir @entity18 , took on mr @entity8 as a gardener and forester in 1981 to look after the grounds of his country home , set in the @entity12 countryside above the @entity90			1
lord @entity15 - long satirised by @entity92 as sir @entity93 - was a staunch champion of the countryside and a keen ornithologist			2
the court heard mr @entity8 worked for him until his death in 1989 aged 72 , and then for @entity98 born @entity14			0
he lived in a lodge on the estate until he left her employment in 2000			0
ruling : three top judges at the @entity104 decided that the case would not go ahead , the second court to do so his duties also included tending pheasants and feeding the ponies			2
but it was using the mechanical tools , mr @entity8 alleges , that caused the ‘ intrusive ’ ringing in his ears			0
he claims he had a 45 per cent reduction in his overall hearing and suffered from what was described as ‘ an irreparable industrial disease ’			0
however , he was told in 2005 that his hearing loss could be age - related			0
arguing that a county court judge had been wrong to strike out mr @entity8 ’ claim , his barrister , @entity121 , insisted that too much account had been taken for @entity15 ’s advanced age and the problems she might face in giving evidence			1
however , dismissing the appeal , @entity79 said that , apart from memory having failed with time , crucial insurance documents had been mislaid and @entity15 ’s defence to her former gardener ’s claim would be unfairly prejudiced by the delay			1
last night mr @entity8 who lives in @entity133 , @entity12 , said that he was ' disappointed ' with the ruling .			2

@entity8 claims his hearing was *ravaged* by his years as a gardener for @entity15
but the @entity104 has thrown out the £ 25,000 claim
the @entity141 , 89 , welcomes ruling as ' justice '
