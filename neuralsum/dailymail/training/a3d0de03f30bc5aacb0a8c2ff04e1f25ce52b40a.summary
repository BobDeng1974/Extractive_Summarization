doctors suspected that he had inflammation of the spine and needed to carry out an mri scan to confirm this mrs @entity42 said that before her son developed the numbness in his legs he was healthy and did a lot of cycling and swimming despite his size ‘ he just wanted to know what exactly was wrong with him and know how to get better			1

he was such a lovely lad and i adored him			0
‘ he did start to get the feeling back in his legs and he started physio but the progress was n’t very good			0

' whilst mr @entity7 was with us we provided him with a bariatric chair and a specially ordered bed with a pressure relieving mattress to reduce his risk of developing a pressure ulcer			0
' mr @entity7 was also receiving the appropriate medication to prevent a blood clot as well as physiotherapy			1
mrs @entity42 said : ' he was such a lovely lad and i adored him ' the hospital has apologised to mr @entity7 's family and says it has invested in better facilities for obese patients ' since then we have continued to improve processes and the specialist equipment we have available for this patient group			1
' unfortunately at the time there was a delay in accessing a suitable mri for mr @entity7			2
' last year we replaced all of our @entity15 scanners and have purchased the widest ones available , which can take a patient up to 200kgs			0
' it is worth pointing out that it is very rare that we are unable to scan a patient because of their weight , and on the rare occasions we do have difficulties it is because of the patients ’ body shape and their inability to fit into the machine			0
' in these instances we would refer the patient to the nearest hospital with the equipment to perform the mri , which happens to be over 90 miles away in @entity157			0

he was admitted to the hospital while waiting for an mri scan
but he was too big for hospital 's scanner which meant there was a delay
doctors contacted the local zoo to see if there was a larger scanner

the hospital has apologised and improved its facilities for obese patients
