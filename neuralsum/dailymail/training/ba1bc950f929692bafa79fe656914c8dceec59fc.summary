this is the dramatic moment rescue workers finally began the process of winching a cave explorer to safety after he spent a week trapped 3,200 feet below ground			1
@entity7 , 52 , suffered serious head injuries seven days ago while exploring the @entity10 cave system near the @entity11 , close to the @entity13 border			1
the £ 2million process to bring him to the surface is expected to take several days , but finally got under way after doctors assisted by 200 rescue specialists climbed two and half miles down into the cave to treat mr @entity7 and make sure he was well enough to be brought out			1
' after two days treating him inside the caves , rescuers finally strapped mr @entity7 to a stretcher , with the process to carry him out of the network of tunnels now well under way			1
' we are very glad that the patient is able to tolerate the transport so well , ' doctor @entity42 said			2
but it will still take several more days to get mr @entity7 to the @entity47 has a heating system and a neck brace attached to him in a bid to avoid further brain swelling on his journey back to the light			1
some @entity55 media reported that doctors considered boring into his skull while underground to relieve pressure on his brain , but it is unclear whether this procedure was actually carried out			2
a graphic shows where the cave explorer was stuck - far from the entrance of the complex cave system brave : rescuers at the entrance of the @entity70 cave prepare to make the 3,200 foot journey below ground to bring @entity7 to the surface speed : the mission to rescue mr @entity7 is becoming a race against time			1
storms are forecast for the area where the cave entrance ( pictured ) is located @entity7 may have been trapped for a week , but a group of @entity82 miners hold the world record for surviving the longest time stuck below ground			1
the 33 men were trapped for a total of 69 days following the collapse of the @entity90 copper - gold mine on august 5 , 2010			2
it was n't until october 13 that the last miner was lifted to safety in a tiny capsule that could only hold one person at a time and took a full 15 minutes to reach the surface			2
all 33 miners survived the traumatic ordeal , with almost all of them in a good medical condition with no long - term physical effects			0
part of their incredible feat of survival was due to a spirit among the men that they must simply accept their situation and not panic			0
despite having suffered a serious brain injury , certain passages within the caves are so narrow that the explorer will be expected to get up and walk himself			1
foam , of the type used in building to insulate walls , has been sprayed on him to both cushion and warm him on his journey			0
he is also medicated - tranquilized , in effect - to keep him calm in the cold , pitch darkness where progress is agonisingly slow			0
there are , for example , five shafts measuring 200 feet each , that he must be pulled up with only a few centimetres between him and the dripping rock face			2
mr @entity7 was seriously injured by a falling rock while he was wearing a helmet during the early hours of last sunday morning			1
by the time a paramedic reached his side he was already showing the first signs of hypothermia , as the temperature in the spot where he is lying underground never reaches above @entity137			2
it can only be reached by crawling through a labyrinth of tiny spaces , rappelling down sheer drops and making difficult climes in the pitch dark			0
going underground : the £ 2million process to bring @entity7 to the surface is expected to take several days			1
doctors assisted by 200 rescue specialists have climbed two and half miles down into the cave support : infrastructure for the rescue team has been set up near the entrance to the @entity70 cave if weather makes air support impossible , the @entity155 ( members of which are pictured ) says it will make the trips using pack mules mr @entity7 , who works as a physicist in @entity162 , is strapped into a specialised stretcher , wrapped in a sleeping bag and layers of styrofoam to keep him warm			1
a doctor with the rescue party is carrying a skull drill in case he begins to suffer bleeding on the brain , which could cause the pressure in his skull to rise to dangerous levels			2
the mission to bring out mr @entity7 is becoming a race against time			1
storms are forecast for the area where the cave entrance is located			0
heavy rain could flood the cave , which acts as a drainage system for the mountains			0
helicopters have been making up to ten trips a day to the entrance to the cave system , which is 6,000ft up in the @entity188			0
if weather makes air support impossible , the @entity155 says it will make the trips using pack mules			0
a rescuer explores the @entity70 cave where an explorer is currently lying injured 3,200ft below specialist rescue workers from @entity197 and @entity32 have arrived to help with the arduous rescue effort , which could take up to several more days and even weeks @entity55 newspapers are already beginning to ask questions about the cost of the rescue operation , but authorities are refusing to comment on how much has been spent			1
@entity204 , deputy director of the @entity206 rescue , told @entity207 : ' for us , salvation is at the forefront			0
' we do not ask if someone is insured or not – we are committed to the rescue			0
' cave rescue specialists from @entity55 , @entity32 and @entity197 have all been drafted in as part of the rescue mission			0
the giant @entity70 complex is under the @entity217 mountain range			0
according to legend , the @entity218 sleeps beneath the mountains and will one day emerge to lead @entity55 to glory			0
the entrance to the caves was only discovered in 1995			0
mr @entity7 's expedition had set out to map uncharted areas of the cave and was scheduled to take a month .			1

@entity7 , 52 , suffered head injuries in a rock fall underground
he has spent the last week trapped *thousands* of feet below the surface
rescuers found him on saturday , and have now started lifting him to safety
despite suffering a serious brain injury explorer will have to help rescuers
