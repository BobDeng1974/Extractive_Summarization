@entity7 was sentenced to three months behind bars for possessing objectionable material after downloading @entity11 anime cartoons three years ago			1
his conviction in @entity13 has sparked debate over what harm is caused by digitally created pornography			0
jailed : a courtroom in @entity13 jailed a man for three months for watching cartoon pornography @entity7 , who has previous convictions for indecently assaulting a teenage boy and has been through rehabilitation programmes , said that the videos came from an established tradition of @entity11 manga and hentai , which is cartoon pornography			1
@entity7 's lawyer @entity27 argued that the images were n't even depictions of people but of ' pixies and trolls ' that ' you knew at a glance were n't human '			1
he went on to describe @entity7 's conviction as the ' law gone mad ' , according to the @entity38 website			1
but @entity42 pornography group @entity40 director @entity39 said the images were illegal because they encouraged people ' to migrate from there to the real thing '			0
he conceded that no child had been harmed in the making of the images but said that ' it 's all part of that spectrum '			0
he described images of child abuse as a huge problem in @entity11 claiming that the practice had found its way into computer games			2
@entity59 philosophy lecturer @entity58 , who writes on the aesthetics of video games , said the case raised two key questions : did producing the pictures harm anyone , and could their viewing and distribution be injurious to the public good ? debate : @entity7 's sentencing for watching @entity11 manga and hentai cartoons has sparked debate over what harm is caused by digitally created images			1
the manga style ( pictured ) enjoys popularity with all ages in @entity11 he said : ' the worry is that viewing or distributing such images could support the sexual exploitation of children even if the production of the images did not actually involve the exploitation of any children			2
' ' it 's not enough that no one was harmed in the making of the videos , the law takes a protective role and says there are some things we just do n't want circulating in society , ' he said			0
@entity98 associate philosophy professor @entity97 added that the sentence would have been handed to @entity7 because of worries that the images could promote harm to real people in the future			2
@entity7 himself argued that under the law he could , in theory , be convicted of possessing objectionable images of stick figures			1
he admitted he was interested in the images but he said it was for their artistic merit and as ' a bit of a laugh '			0
he did not find them sexually arousing , he said			0
mr @entity58 said there were ethical issues that complicated the case , adding that we naturally make moral judgements about the character of a person based on their chosen form of entertainment			0
but he concluded that it is dangerous to convict someone for their ' moral views ' .			0
