as the 2014 - 15 campaign gets underway , we look back at some memorable opening games from years gone by ... @entity9 1 - 3 @entity10 ( 2013 ) as @entity13 's side walked out on the pitch , it was evident that the team was nearly identical to the one that finished the last campaign			1
@entity10 recorded a 3 - 1 victory and , when the final whistle blew , the @entity20 erupted into boos , protesting the lack of money spent on improving the squad			1
@entity13 then splashed Â£ 42.5million to bring @entity27 international @entity26 to north @entity28 from @entity29			0
unrest : @entity9 fans were unhappy at the lack of money spent by manager @entity13 city 3 - 2 @entity34 ( 2012 ) one would have thought that @entity0 champions would beat newly promoted @entity34 quite comfortably			1
but it was not the case as @entity34 put up a fight and gave @entity33 a run for their money , forcing the champions to come from 2 - 1 down and win 3 - 2 in dramatic fashion			1
to the rescue : @entity45 scored the equaliser as @entity33 fought back to beat @entity34 @entity47 0 - 4 @entity48 ( 2010 ) @entity48 were clear underdogs for the 2010 - 11 season			0
they finished sixth in the championship and won promotion via the play - offs			0
but they could n't have gotten off to a better start as they thumped @entity47 4 - 0 in their opening @entity0 game			2
it was the start of a fascinating campaign for @entity48 which ultimately resulted into relegation			0
flying start : @entity48 began their @entity0 campaign in 2010 with a thumping 4 - 0 win at @entity47 shock : the surprise victory was the start of a fascinating @entity0 season for @entity48 @entity67 1 - 6 @entity9 ( 2009 ) it is rare to see an away team have it so easy at @entity70 , especially in the opening game of the season			1

rising high : @entity76 scores a header as @entity9 run riot on @entity67 at @entity70 @entity79 1 - 0 @entity80 ( 2004 ) @entity82 's first league match was against the mighty @entity80			1
the @entity84 manager arrived at @entity85 with a big reputation and he was handed a tough start against sir @entity89 's side			0

new owner @entity106 had given @entity107 a huge transfer budget and the likes of @entity110 , @entity111 , @entity112 , @entity113 and @entity114 all arrived in big - money deals			0
@entity117 's winner silenced @entity118 and fired a warning to the rest of the league that @entity79 meant business			0
