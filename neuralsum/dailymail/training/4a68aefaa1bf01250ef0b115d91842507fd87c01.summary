he said : ' it 's depressing because it says to kids ' this is what life is like '			0
' a gun for a four - year - old is quite shocking			2
i think there is a difference between boys playing with soldiers and someone actually staging a bank robbery - and it 's not like it 's a tacky brand			1
' there is something a bit nasty about depicting a crime and it could then make it scary for kids going in to banks			2
' it 's also a bit grim people being run over			0
' you do have a woman bank robber so it is half politically correct			0

' we fully support creating a safe environment for all children and would hope that in their own small way our sets deliver this in a secure , but believable , way			2
