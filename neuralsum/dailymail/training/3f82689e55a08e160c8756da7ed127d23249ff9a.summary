in a desperate bid to have a baby , his wife sought a sperm donor from ' unofficial channels ' and ended up having an affair			1
she eventually conceived twice this way but her infidelity led to her having an abortion and then becoming a single parent			0
marriage breakdown : @entity20 anonymously shared his story on today 's @entity22 her ex-husband appeared on today 's @entity22 to share his story but did not real his true identity and all names were changed			2
@entity20 recalled how he met his second wife , @entity27 , who was ' significantly younger ' than him in 2004 when he was a divorcee in his sixties with a grown - up son			1
after his first divorce , he decided he did not want to have any more children and had a vasectomy			0
@entity27 was aware of the situation when they met and fell in love and said it was n't an issue			1
they married in 2008 and then the situation changed			0
@entity27 , now in her mid-thirties , decided she did want to become a mother after all			2
' it 's very hard when you ca n't supply your wife with the one thing she really wants ' @entity20 explained to this morning presenters @entity48 and @entity49 : ' her biological clock was ticking and things changed , we were in love and in stable relationship it was the natural next step			2
' it 's very hard when you ca n't supply your wife with the one thing she really wants			0
it 's a very hard thing to come to terms with			0
' @entity20 said he looked into having his vasectomy reversed but was told there was ' no chance ' because it had been carried out too long ago			1
the couple then discussed using a sperm donor but dismissed doing this via official channels			1
@entity20 explained : ' the problem with going through official channels is you have no idea who the father will be and have no connection with them			2
@entity27 wanted a junior version of myself			2
' @entity20 thought this meant the conversation was over so he was ' taken aback ' in 2010 when @entity27 revealed she had found ' someone like me ' after researching unregulated donor websites and had set up a meeting			1
' i thought the conversation was dead			0
i did n't know she was pursuing other avenues to get a donor , ' he said			0
' she said she had been looking into it and had found someone			0
they had arranged to meet seven days later			0
' he added : ' we both took it for granted it would be artificial insemination , sex was never implied or spoken about			1
' betrayed : he said he did n't know his wife 's relationship with the sperm donor had become sexual @entity20 agreed to escort @entity27 to met the donor , called @entity100 , and took an instant dislike to him			1
' i did n't like @entity100 , it was his whole demeanor , he kept us waiting at the designated meeting place and then hardly acknowledged @entity27 , ' he said			2
@entity20 said at no point did he consent to the pair having natural sex			0
after this meeting @entity100 donated sperm for artificial insemination to @entity27			1
but @entity20 said : ' that was the only time artificial insemination took place , the rest of the time it was sex			1
' @entity27 began visiting @entity100 once a month when she was ovulating			2
inevitably the situation began to have a detrimental effect on her marriage			0
@entity20 said he began to suspect her relationship with @entity100 had become sexual but did n't find out for sure until they had a " blazing row "			1
' i was shocked but was n't completely surprised when she told me she was pregnant again , i had a strong feeling she was still seeing @entity100 ' he recalled : ' i shouted at her , " you might as well be having sex with him ! " and she said " we are ! " ' when @entity27 then fell pregnant , @entity20 demanded she have an abortion or he would leave her			1
he admitted : ' she had the abortion which i regret , it was a terrible thing to ask woman to do but i was n't thinking straight at the time			0
' after the abortion , @entity27 and @entity20 's relationship became beyond repair and he admitted they were living under the same roof but " not living as a married couple "			1
unbeknown to him , @entity27 resumed her affair with @entity100 and fell pregnant again			1
by now , @entity20 said @entity27 was in love with @entity100 and intended to divorce @entity20 and raise her child with him			1
he said : ' i was shocked but was n't completely surprised when she told me she was pregnant again , i had a strong feeling she was still seeing @entity100			2
' but after @entity20 and @entity27 split up , @entity100 was n't interested in raising the child with her as she had hoped			1
@entity20 had a vasectomy years ago before meeting his second wife who was 30 years his junior instead , he claimed no responsibility as the father under the @entity148 of 2008			1
he denied having a sexual relationship with @entity27 and said she had only ever received his sperm via artificial insemination			1
@entity27 launched legal proceedings taking her case to @entity155 â€™s @entity154 last july			0
@entity20 said : ' it was bought out through evidence that they had been having sex relationship for a number of months and he could not deny it in court under cross reference			2
' ' motherhood for me has come at an extremely high price ' it also transpired during the court proceedings that @entity100 was a prolific sperm donor who had sired up to 30 children			1
he was registered on three different websites and had even advertised his services at ' male - dominated breeding orgies '			0
the judge on the case said @entity100 had committed " calculating betrayal and abashed dishonesty " and had " concealed his overall activities from recipients he entered into relationships "			0
but he added that @entity27 had also been " untruthful , devious and manipulative			0
" single mother : @entity27 aborted her first child with @entity100 then kept the second - but he denied to take responsibility as the father ( posed by model ) the judge ruled that the baby had been conceived during a sexual relationship and as a result , @entity100 was " not only his biological father but also his legal parent			1
" @entity20 is now trying to get on with his life as a single man again after all the hurt and betrayal			2
@entity27 said in a statement read on this morning : ' motherhood for me has come at an extremely high price			0
i have an adorable child who is my entire life however that has not compensated for the devastating and highly distressing events that unfolded and will undoubtedly stay with me for a lifetime			0
' meanwhile , @entity100 added in a statement that he sees himself as the victim			0
he said : ' the husband was fully aware of his wife 's quest to conceive a child at no point did he intervene to say he did not wish to go ahead , had he done so at any point we would not be in the position we are now			0
the process has been destructive to me emotionally , personally and financially			0
