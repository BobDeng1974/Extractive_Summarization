this map reveals the damage alcohol is causing around the country			0
with soaring rates of hospital admissions - and alcohol - related liver disease - a new study has mapped how much @entity7 in each region are drinking – and how many are dying as a result			1
it found @entity11 is the booze capital of @entity13 , with residents drinking 20.9 units a week , the equivalent of almost two bottles of wine and a shot			0
the alcohol consumption for this area of @entity11 – which includes @entity22 and @entity23 - is 18 per cent higher than the national average			1
the boxes reveal how many units of alcohol per week are drunk by residents in the area , and how many alcohol related deaths per 100,000 adults in the area			1
the study found @entity11 and the @entity38 drank the most units , while @entity40 and the @entity41 drank the least more people die of alcohol related deaths than in any other region , with 24.5 deaths per 100,000 population			1
this is more than double the rate for @entity40 , which had the lowest rate of 9.4 alcohol - related deaths per 100,000 population			1
the study , by @entity51 , was the first to analyse alcohol sales data , an indicator of alcohol consumption , as well as alcohol - related deaths			1
it found people in the @entity38 , @entity11 , @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity61 were the biggest boozers , with higher levels of alcohol sales per adult than the average for @entity13			1
there were lower sales of alcohol in @entity40 , @entity70 and the @entity41 , the study found			2
the high volume of sales in @entity73 ( 19 per cent higher than the national average ) was mostly due to spirits and cider sold through pubs and restaurants , but sales of wine through supermarkets and other off - licences were also high			1
however while the @entity84 had the joint highest consumption level , it had one of the lowest alcohol death rates			0
researchers at @entity51 and the @entity89 suggested that this could be due to tourism			0
the @entity38 , which was defined by the study as mainly @entity93 and @entity94 , had one of the smallest populations but also one of the highest rates of second homes			0
people who visit this area but do not live there would increase the sales figures for alcohol and would not show up for alcohol - related deaths			1
with soaring rates of hospital admissions - and alcohol - related liver disease - the study mapped how much @entity7 in each region are drinking – and how many are dying as a result			1
the high levels of alcohol consumption in the @entity38 were attributed to tourism			0
people who visit this area but do not live there would increase the sales figures for alcohol , but not show up for alcohol - related deaths and the stereotype about @entity120 and their love of whisky rang true , as both @entity120 regions , but particularly @entity11 , had substantially higher spirits sales than any other region , especially through off - licenses			1
in @entity61 and the northern @entity129 regions , more beer was sold per adult than in any other region , with the drink accounting for 46 per cent of the market share for alcohol here			2
the biggest wine drinkers reside in the @entity38 and in @entity73 , with 35 per cent of the market share of wine sold here			0
the low volume of sales in @entity40 was because of lower sales through off - licences			2
it was also found that regions with higher sales per adult typically had higher rates of alcohol - related deaths			1
@entity51 officials warn death rates linked to alcohol - related liver disease have risen ' considerably ' over the last few decades			1
liver disease kills 11,000 people a year in @entity129 , despite the fact that major causes such as alcohol misuse and obesity are preventable			0
the lower limits for safe drinking recommended by doctors are set at 21 units for men and 14 for women			0
a small 125ml glass of 13 per cent wine contains 1.6 units , while a regular 4 per cent pint of lager contains 2.3 units			0
a 25ml single 40 per cent spirit and mixer contains one unit , while a 275ml bottle of 5.5 per cent alcopop contains 1.5 units			0
all previous studies have looked at alcohol consumption for regions in @entity13 based on self - reported data , which can be biased because of low response rates , the sample taken not being representative , and because people do not accurately report how much they drank			0
the use of alcohol sales data is a more accurate and objective way to estimate how much the country is really drinking			2
however , researchers warned this data is still subject to its own biases , such as wastage and spillage ; consumption by tourists ; and unrecorded alcohol , which includes homebrew , smuggled alcohol and alcohol intended for industrial and medical use			0
the study 's lead @entity199 , of @entity51 , said : ' our study provides support for the relationship between alcohol consumption and alcohol - related mortality across regions in @entity13 , which has n't always been the case using survey data to estimate consumption			2
' future studies should consider the use of data from a range of different sources to provide a better understanding of alcohol consumption in @entity217 , its relationship with alcohol - related harms , and the impact of different alcohol policy approaches			2
' the results were published in the journal @entity224 .			0

study was the first to analyse alcohol sales @entity228 drinks 18 *%* more than the national average
