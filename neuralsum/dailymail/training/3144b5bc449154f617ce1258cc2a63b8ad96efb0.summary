the @entity1 would need to be bailed out if there was an ' @entity4 ' recession while state - owned @entity5 and @entity6 would be severely tested , it was revealed today			1
the @entity7 has stress - tested how @entity10 's eight major banks and building societies would fare if the @entity10 undergoes a crisis wiping a third off house prices and the economy imploded			1
the @entity1 's capital would be exhausted if that happened with its capital ratio falling to a theoretical minus 2.6 per cent , the @entity7 said			1
in total the eight high street banks and building societies would lose £ 13billion			0
before the results were released @entity1 boss @entity20 admitted it would be ' no surprise ' if it fails to pass after its near - collapse last year			1
it came shortly after a £ 1.5billion black hole emerged in the bank 's finances he added : ' the bank is much stronger than a year ago			0
as the regulator notes today , we have achieved the target of building our capital base and the actions we have taken during the first year of our business plan have made the bank more secure for the benefit of all stakeholders			0
' the bank was told today it must cut its loan book by £ 5.5 billion - but said the @entity7 's minus 2.6 per cent capital figure was the case a year ago but not today			1
previously it had a £ 1.5 billion hole was discovered in its finances , following its ill - fated purchase of the @entity50 and attempts to buy more than 600 @entity6 branches			2
it was also hit by scandal after reverend @entity27 quit the £ 132,000 - a - year job as chairman for taking hard drugs and using rent boys			0
he ran the bank even though he had no major banking experience			0
the @entity61 - 80 per cent - owned by the taxpayer - just passed the test while @entity63 , 25 per cent - controlled by the @entity64 , also slipped through			0
the test examined how lenders ' balance sheets would stand up to a potential doomsday scenario of economic crisis by calculating the ratio of capital against loan assets on their balance sheets in such an event			2
it judged that @entity6 , 25 per cent owned by the taxpayer , would fall to a capital ratio of five per cent under such a scenario , though by taking severe actions such as cost - cutting this would be 5.3 per cent			1
it compares with a minimum benchmark set by the bank of 4.5 per cent			0
the group , which includes the @entity85 and is heavily exposed to the @entity10 housing market , ' remains susceptible to a severe economic downturn ' , the test found			0
but it said that , in light of the measures it already had in train , it did not require @entity6 to submit a revised capital plan			2
the results did not comment on whether the test would affect @entity6 ' ability to pay a dividend next year , though it assumed that payouts would not be made in the stress scenario			1
in trouble : @entity5 and @entity6 , who were bailed out by the taxpayer in the last recession , scraped through the stress test for @entity5 , 80 per cent owned by the state , the capital ratio would fall to 4.6 per cent in the stress scenario , or 5.2 per cent after ' strategic management actions ' which could include cost - cutting			1
the @entity1 said it would ordinarily have required @entity5 to submit a revised capital plan but , given the progress already made and the capital strengthening actions in its updated plans , this would not be necessary			1
allowing for emergency ' management actions ' , @entity115 would see its capital ratio fall to 7.5 per cent under the scenario with @entity120 scoring 8.7 per cent , @entity121 6.7 per cent , @entity122 7.9 per cent and @entity123 8.1 per cent			0
@entity7 governor @entity124 said following today 's exercise : ' this was a demanding test			2
' the results show that the core of the banking system is significantly more resilient , that it has the strength to continue to serve the real economy even in a severe stress , and that growing confidence in the system is merited			0

@entity7 tested eight financial *institutions* to see if they would fail
scenario included falling house prices , *gdp* , rising *inflation* and interest rates
@entity1 failed and @entity5 and @entity6 were both severely tested
