by @entity0 published : 10:45 est , 25 february 2014 @entity2 : 11:47 est , 25 february 2014 former @entity4 governor @entity3 has no qualms about hiding his new relationship with a much younger woman just weeks after his divorce was finalized			1
the disgraced @entity9 was spotted with his girlfriend @entity10 at monday night 's @entity12 game and it seemed like the pair did n't pay much attention to the court			1
@entity3 , 54 , and his former campaign manager @entity10 , 31 , were seen kissing throughout the game against the @entity18 on monday			1
going public : former governor @entity3 and his campaign manager - turned - girlfriend @entity10 were spotted kissing throughout monday night 's @entity12 game at @entity20 in the spirit : the kicks ended up losing by two points , but that did n't stop the pair from celebrating not shying away : though the former governor wore a baseball cap with his suit and tie , they did not to try to hide their faces during the game as their relationship is very much public after they were outed in december the once - covert couple have now clearly let go of any attempts to keep their private lives private as they put on a full display at @entity20			1
they cheered loudly and grabbed each other at different moments , going in for a kiss at more quiet points in the game			0
the former governor paired his suit and tie with a @entity49 hat – a cap from a different sport – perhaps as an attempt to fly under the radar			0
his girlfriend sported a similarly professional look , wearing a crisp white button - down , but opted against wearing her own baseball cap			0
this is not the first time that the couple have made an appearance to support the home team , as they were spotted going to a @entity12 game last month and following the victory with a drink - filled night at @entity65 's , a bar across the street from @entity20			2
the timing of that night out was interesting as @entity3 had a meeting with his lawyer to sign divorce papers the next morning , continuing the formal process of separation from his wife @entity74			0
together : @entity10 worked as @entity3 's comptroller campaign manager and they reportedly started dating after he lost - but while he was still legally married to his wife @entity74 consequences : after the news broke , she was no longer considered a candidate for the top spot as @entity82 's press secretary their latest trip to a basketball game marked a different kind of milestone for the couple , as ms. @entity10 has continued to put herself out into the public sphere but for more political reasons after running @entity3 's failed ' comeback ' campaign to become @entity94 's new comptroller , @entity10 joined @entity82 's team and was widely considered to be the likely candidate for the mayor 's press secretary			1
just as the final staffing decision was due to be made , photos were released that showed the former governor , who resigned years ago after admitting to soliciting prostitutes , sneaking in and out of @entity10 's apartment in december			2
now after spending almost two months under the radar , @entity10 is starting to actively try to restart her consulting career			2
she is now working for the @entity108 governor 's @entity106 , paying close attention to governor @entity110 of @entity111 who is considered a possible 2016 candidate should @entity113 choose not to run for president			0
thrill of the game : this is the second time in as many months that @entity3 and @entity10 have been seen at @entity12 games together rough call : @entity10 , 31 , has written about how she was surprised by all of the female commentators who had a problem with her dating @entity3 , 54 , who infamously had to resign from office after his trysts with prostitutes on sunday , @entity10 even made the surprising decision to pen an op - ed blasting her former boss ' plans to pay for universal pre-k in @entity94 by taxing the city 's rich			1
' while @entity82 won the mayoral election in a walk , and earned his landslide with a bold platform of taxing the rich to expand pre-k , his heady victory obscured a stubborn fact : the power to decide this issue does n’t reside in @entity141			0
it resides in @entity144 , ' she wrote in the @entity145			0
her op - ed was matched up against one written by @entity147 , @entity82 's wife			1
' at this point , @entity82 should stop spending political capital on a losing fight , declare victory by taking @entity152 up on his offer of a blank check , and focus on running the city , ' @entity10 wrote			2
' for those who still have their money on @entity82 in this heavyweight matchup , i suggest moving it over to @entity152 – fast			0
