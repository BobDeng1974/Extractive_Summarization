@entity0 laid down a heroic @entity2 marker by producing a stunning defensive effort to keep @entity4 at bay in @entity6			1
the @entity7 fought back from 17 - 0 down at the @entity8 to take a three - point lead just before half - time			1
but @entity12 ’s men were n’t to be denied their first autumn @entity14 clean sweep since 2006 and it leaves @entity4 — who also lost 29 - 26 to @entity17 — desperate to avoid the humiliation of a hat - trick of november defeats when they round off their tour against @entity21 at @entity22 on saturday @entity23 raced onto @entity25 's perfectly judged crossfield kick to give @entity0 a dream start after 10 minutes @entity0 winger @entity27 intercepts a stray @entity4 pass to race 90 metres upfield @entity28 ( right ) managers to track down @entity27 but the @entity31 flyer manages to touch down for @entity0 's second try @entity23 tries to offload in the tackle but @entity34 does well to disrupt the @entity37 winger 's pass @entity0 got off to a lightning start thanks to tries from @entity23 and @entity27 , while @entity25 booted 16 points			1
@entity4 scrum - half @entity42 crossed twice , with @entity34 claiming a third score for the visitors , but @entity0 held firm under huge final - quarter pressure			1
captain @entity47 said : ‘ it really is a good win			0
we could n’t have had a better first 20 minutes and it was frustrating to let them back in in the next 20			0
@entity4 scrum half @entity42 intercepts @entity23 's stray pass to race away unopposed and get his side back into the contest @entity58 flyer @entity56 ( left ) takes on @entity0 fullback @entity59 @entity60 gets an offload away under pressure from @entity4 winger @entity63 ‘ but they are a fast side who put you under pressure and are probably further down the road in terms of match play than we are , so the way we finished off the game was very satisfying			1
’ @entity0 will now go into @entity2 year with a spring in their step after atoning for last year ’s 32 - 15 defeat to @entity4 in combative style			1
it also provided some relief for coach @entity12 as it was later revealed he had been suffering from the effects of suspected appendicitis all day and had left the ground for medical tests straight after the final whistle			0
@entity56 and @entity59 collide after contesting for a high ball during what was a frantic first 40 minutes of rugby at the @entity8 @entity0 flanker @entity60 takes a high ball supported by hooker @entity90 ( right ) as @entity91 ( right ) watches on on the pitch , @entity25 kicked an early penalty before teeing up the game ’s opening try with a precise kick which allowed @entity23 to slide home			1
@entity27 pulled off a keen - eyed interception and galloped over for a second try but @entity4 clawed one back when @entity42 ntercepted @entity23 ’s pass to hare home			1
@entity34 ’s conversion cut the deficit to 10 points			0
the @entity4 then scored a controversial second			0
@entity42 ’ scoring pass to @entity34 appeared forward , but was awarded by @entity109 television match official @entity108			2
@entity34 missed the conversion , though @entity42 crossed again to level the scores			2
@entity34 ’s penalty wrestled the visitors into the lead for the first time before @entity25 tied the scores with the last kick of a breathless half			0
@entity25 posted his third penalty after the restart before @entity34 responded , and the teams were still locked at 23 - 23 on the hour			0
@entity59 launched an ambitious drop - goal attempt from long range after a period of @entity126 pressure but his effort rebounded off the right - hand post			0
however , @entity25 ’s fourth penalty of the night did edge @entity0 back into a three - point lead			2
@entity4 duly pegged @entity0 back into their half for the remaining 16 minutes but , unlike in times past , this gritty group , conquerors of @entity133 and @entity134 over the last two weekends , bravely held out for a famous win .			2

@entity0 led 17 - 0 early on thanks to tries from @entity23 and @entity27
a brace from @entity42 and a @entity34 try brought the @entity4 back into the match
@entity147 's side finish the autumn *internationals* *unbeaten*
@entity0 lock @entity150 named @entity151
