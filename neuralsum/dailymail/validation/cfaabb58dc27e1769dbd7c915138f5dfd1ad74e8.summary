an @entity1 informant sent to infiltrate a @entity3 mosque has revealed how his handlers encouraged him to have sexual relations with @entity7 women if it meant getting better intel			1
@entity10 was known to members of the @entity12 in @entity13 as @entity14 , a @entity16 @entity15 who was a devout and , at times , radical @entity7			1
however he was really a petty criminal with forgery convictions who was hired by the @entity1 to go undercover as part of an intelligence surveillance operation after 9/11			1
@entity10 went public with the operation after his cover was blown in 2007 , which exposed some of the government 's little - known methods of anti-terrorism policing			1
now , in a new interview has given more details about what his mission entailed			0
@entity35 : @entity36 , a petty criminal , was recruited by the @entity1 as an informant as part of post- 9/11 surveillance operations			1
he went undercover as a radical muslim for 15 months at an @entity13 mosque speaking with @entity43 on monday , @entity10 said he was paid to seek out potential threats and gain ' personal information ' about such people			1
agents sought him out after he spent some time in prison for using fraudulent checks			1
his mission was to obtain email address and phone numbers of anyone suspicious and get the names of any of their associates , which he would then feed back to his @entity1 handlers			2
he also planted some recording devices and was taught ' how to be @entity7 ' , he claims			0
' the @entity1 trained me in the tenets of @entity62 , in the elementary principles of @entity64 , and just to blend into the community and to slowly integrate myself as a @entity7 male , ' @entity10 told @entity43			2
however @entity10 's was taken one step further when he claims to have been told to become intimate with some of the women he was mining for information if it meant getting more from them			2
scene : @entity10 started attending the @entity12 in @entity13 ( pictured ) saying his name was @entity14 , a @entity16 @entity15 who was a devout and , at times , radical @entity7 ' i portrayed myself as a unmarried male , although i was married , ' he said			1
' within the @entity77 , they would help me to get a bride , so they would introduce me to single @entity7 women			0
' i would go out on dates and things like that			0
' ( my @entity1 handlers ) instructed me , if i was getting good intel , to allow it to go into sexual relations			1
' in a previous interview with @entity88 , @entity10 confirmed he had sex with at least one of the women he was surveying			0
@entity10 claims he received $ 177,000 tax free from the government for the 15 months of work he did , which equated to over $ 11,000 each month			1
regret : @entity10 says he now realizes he was motivated by money and was spying on innocent people ironically , senior officials at the @entity100 contacted the @entity1 when @entity101 started speaking of jihad and plans to blow up buildings as part of an entrapment technique			1
in 2007 the center filed a restraining order against @entity10 , ending the mission			0
in retrospect , @entity10 says the money distracted him from what was actually happening			0
' i began to be conflicted because i was spying on innocent people			0
they were not involved in criminal activity , ' he said			0
' ' they were not espousing terrorist rhetoric , but i was still spying on them and giving the @entity1 the information they wanted			0
' after @entity10 went public with what he 'd done , the @entity1 defended its tactics , claiming such operations had prevented further terrorist atrocities in the wake of 9/11			2
@entity125 , assistant director in charge of the @entity1 's @entity128 field office , said that in certain circumstances , if there is evidence of a crime , @entity1 agents may ' conduct an activity that might somehow involve surveillance in and about a mosque			2
' he added : ' i know there 's a lot of suspicion that that 's the focus , that we 're looking at the mosques , monitoring who is coming and going			0
that 's just not the case			0
