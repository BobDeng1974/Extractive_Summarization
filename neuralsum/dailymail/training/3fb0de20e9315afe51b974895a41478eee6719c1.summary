' @entity1 reminds me of a young @entity3 , ' @entity0 said on @entity4 before the game			1
perhaps an ambitious claim at this early stage of his career , but that a young @entity10 is being compared to a @entity12 - winning @entity11 is testament to @entity1 's progress this season			1
15 goals in all competitions this term , second only to @entity19 in the @entity21 standings , and level with @entity24 's star man @entity23			1
@entity1 's main battle against @entity26 came against centre - back @entity27 ( left ) @entity1 ( left ) takes a shot at the @entity26 goal , but it is a simple save for @entity33 goalkeeper @entity32 fifty @entity35 appearances , 20 goals			1
and now a chance to impress against @entity26			1
@entity39 's side are a team on the up , but have struggled with injuries defensively this season			0
against @entity35 on sunday , they started with @entity44 , @entity27 and @entity45			0
a @entity46 back three for an @entity10 forward to attack			1
it took just six minutes for him to make an impact , nearly threading the ball through to @entity52 after brushing @entity27 off with ease			0
the game was quiet for large spells			0
nobody was outstanding , and it finished goalless			0
nevertheless , @entity1 was impressive , as always			2
there was a moment midway through the second half that summed up his performance			0
he was anonymous at times , but worked hard behind the scenes			1
@entity1 once again battles past @entity65 centre - back @entity27 ( right ) during @entity35 ' game against @entity26 the 21 - year - old @entity10 did not set the pitch alight , but his work behind the scenes is very effective drifting into the midfield , the 21 - year - old @entity10 intercepted a @entity26 pass , knocked the ball to a team - mate and drove into the opposition half			1
they lost the ball , and two minutes later @entity1 was back repeating the same task			1
this time , he nicked the ball from a @entity26 man and took the ball with him , bursting through a gap in the midfield			1
he was n't creating chance after chance as he sometimes does , but instead working hard for his team in a deeper area of the pitch			0
when @entity35 are attacking , @entity1 is the main man			2
when they are on the back foot - as they were for large parts of sunday 's game - the @entity10 drops in and fights to regain possession for his team - mates			2
@entity92 ( centre ) took the plaudits after a number of impressive saves , but @entity1 was a close second @entity98 had a golden opportunity to put @entity26 ahead , but @entity100 @entity92 was equal to it as with the early chance , @entity1 was the provider for a @entity35 attack late on in the match			1
a golden opportunity to win it , in fact			0
he did what he does best , running at the @entity26 back - line with speed and power			2
cutting inside , he could have shot , but instead threaded a deft ball through to @entity52			0
it was blasted over the bar , but gave a glimpse of what @entity1 can do			2
he is from the same east @entity118 borough as former @entity120 captain @entity119			0
@entity121 will be watching his progress closely , and at just 21 there is a strong possibility @entity35 's star turn will become a stalwart in the @entity120 ranks too			0
@entity92 rightly took the plaudits after a brilliant goalkeeping display , but @entity1 was there again , discreetly going about his business			2
he tirelessly worked for 90 minutes without ever being outstanding			0
quietly efficient - exactly how the @entity11 team are routinely described			1
perhaps that @entity3 comparison is n't far out , after all .			0

@entity0 described @entity1 as ' like a young @entity3 '
he worked *extremely* hard off the ball against @entity26
@entity1 has scored 15 goals in all competitions this season already
the @entity10 was not outstanding against @entity26 , but his work behind the scenes was quietly efficient
