the split comes as one poll showed @entity4 ’s lead over the @entity19 has been squeezed to one point			1
mr @entity14 is said to have threatened to quit over the ‘ safety first ’ approach favoured by @entity4 leader @entity23 , which relies on @entity25 votes drifting to the @entity26 , and warned he was being ‘ shut out ’ by mr @entity1			1
he is understood to have told mr @entity23 : ‘ @entity1 is totally bloody impossible			2
you have got to do something about him			0
’ mr @entity15 is believed to have snubbed mr @entity1 at a crisis meeting chaired by the @entity4 leader , who insiders said was too weak to intervene			1
meanwhile the party ’s election guru - @entity36 , who mentored @entity38 , was also said to have been sacked and sent back to the @entity39 - although mr @entity1 insisted he was still working for @entity4			1
yesterday , mr @entity1 denied claims of a feud in @entity4 ’s high command			2
he insisted that mr @entity36 was ‘ absolutely ’ still a part of the election campaign team			0
he told the @entity46 ’s @entity45 : ‘ i do n’t think it ’s a great headline for the newspapers saying ‘ @entity4 team united and working for a victory ’ so i think we can dismiss some of the headlines			0
‘ one of the insights of this generation of @entity4 leaders is that it ’s a totally false choice to be credible or radical			0
if you ’re not credible then people wo n’t trust you with the governance of the country			0
if you ’re not radical people just say you ’re all the same			0

@entity1 has had *disagreement* with @entity14 and @entity15
shadow foreign secretary accused of being ' impossible ' to work with
split after one poll showed @entity4 ’s lead over @entity26 has been squeezed
mr @entity14 is said to have threatened to quit over the ' safety first ' approach
thirty five per centers v @entity107 : those who believed they could win the election on just *35* per cent of the vote by *keeping* their core vote happy and counting on *defections* from the @entity26 to @entity25 , against those who believe the party has to aim higher to have any *authority* .
*transformers* v @entity120 : the former group wants @entity4 to take greater risks and offer a *bolder* alternative , the latter fear the electorate would not trust this .
**devolvers** v @entity129 : the **devolvers** want to give more powers to *councils* while *opponents* fear it would lead to a *postcode* *lottery* on all services
@entity138 ; the *tensions* between leader @entity23 and shadow chancellor @entity15 came *dangerously* close to *spilling* out into the open when mr @entity15 *admitted* that his boss messed up his *response* to the @entity144 because he had been looking at @entity146 *coverage* too *closely* .
*gloomsters* v @entity149 : some inside @entity4 believe the party ’s lead is *evaporating* as the cost of living crisis argument is failing to take hold and will reverse by the time of the election . but the *optimists* believe that the *post-budget* bounce for the @entity26 is just the party winning back older *supporters* from @entity25 .
