a business was saved after a pedestrian passing the building rang the boss to say : ' hello , it is raining – in your office			1
' the kind @entity8 stopped and stared in horror through the window of design firm @entity11 as torrents of water gushed from the ceiling , soaking the ground floor			1
the drama was captured on @entity19 footage on cameras both inside and outside the premises in @entity22 , east @entity23			1
scroll down to watch the video the water started running down the door and flooding the entrance before it was noticed a passer - by glances in and notices the water , which by now is dripping from the centre of the ceiling too pouring down : @entity19 footage shows water pouring through the ceiling on to the ground floor of design firm @entity11 in @entity22 , east @entity23 onlookers : pedestrians walking past the business notice the water good samaritan : a woman in a grey coat , pictured right , calls the company director to let him know ' it 's raining in your office ' and now the video has been uploaded to @entity47 and @entity48 – prompting a flood of amused comments			1
company director @entity51 was working on the second floor of the building while 10 members of the staff were at their desks on the first , when he received a frantic call alerting him to the problem			1
he said : ' it was a young woman who just kept saying , it ’s raining , it ’s raining			0
i looked out the window and it was n’t so it was all very confusing			0
' finally she blurted out that it was raining inside			0
i thought it was some mad prank so i sent a colleague to investigate			0
' shocked : distressed members of staff then come down to the ground floor to discover it is covered in ankle - deep water the clear - up begins : several members of staff get to work on the leak and then start cleaning up damage : the flood caused an estimated £ 10,000 worth of damage but it could have caused much more if it had n't been spotted so quickly the cctv cameras picture the member of the staff discovering the reception area at the front of the premises ankle - deep in water and dashing off to get help			1
moments later , dozens of his co-workers descend , looking baffled			0
they dither for a moment while one captures the scene on his mobile phone camera			2
finally the water is switched off and the clean up begins			2
the video of the disaster , set to the soundtrack @entity95 by @entity99 , shows staff desperately moving furniture , collecting water in plastic buckets , mopping , sweeping and using a huge fan to try and dry out the floor			1
mr @entity51 , who has helped bring to life advertising campaigns for @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109 and @entity110 , said : ' our company deals with creating solutions to other people ’s problems			2
mopping up : once the water was switched off the cleaning could begin - all caught on cctv thanks to the intervention from the pedestrian , the damage was kept to a minimum by now the door has been opened and the workers and the clear - up operation is well underway ' as you can see from the video , it took us seven minutes and 32 seconds to solve this particular problem which has got to be a company record			1
' the crisis was caused when a hot water pipe burst in the ceiling			2
mr @entity51 said : ' to coin a well known phrase , we really were " in hot water "			0
there was a lot of open mouths and swearing but generally speaking it was a good example of team work			0
' the flood has caused an estimated £ 10,000 worth of damage but mr @entity51 said it could have been worse			0
' thanks to the kind lady who called to tell us it was raining inside , we managed to fix things fast , ' he said			0
