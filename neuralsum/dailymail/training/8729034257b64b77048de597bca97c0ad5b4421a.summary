prime minister @entity0 claimed a number of small amounts back from the taxpayer - including 38p for a staple remover we have all heard of the £ 1,600 duck house , wide - screen tvs , moats cleared for £ 2,200 and many of the other extravagances that @entity11 put on their expenses			1
after the scandal was exposed and a new , tougher system was introduced to try to stop abuse , it was thought @entity11 would no longer be claiming repayment from taxpayers for risible items			2
but now , rather than submitting outrageously expensive claims , they are accused of squeezing every last penny out of the taxpayer by requesting repayment for the most mundane things			1
for example , @entity0 charged the public purse 7p for a bulldog clip and 38p for a staple remover			1
apart from appearing petty , it also raises the issue of the cost of the bureaucracy involved and whether the pm and his staff ought not be better employed running the country rather than filling in forms to reclaim such piffling amounts			2
for mr @entity0 ’s bulldog clip would n’t have made much of a dent in his estimated £ 4million fortune , and when you consider the cost of office time processing the claim , it will ultimately have landed taxpayers with a bill around four times the cost price			1
so , what other measly items of stationery have @entity11 claimed from the taxpayer in @entity55 ’s equivalent of @entity56 ? health secretary @entity57 , who recently pocketed £ 17 million from the sale of an educational resources company in which he had invested , claimed 5p in parliamentary expenses for a paperclip			1
he also claimed 8p for a page marker and 41p for a black folder			1
such expenses make former @entity65 and @entity67 mp for @entity68 look a spendthrift : she claimed 49p for ‘ cable clips ’ and 69p for a dustpan			1
@entity0 also claimed a whole 7p bulldog clip another who evidently goes shopping for domestic wares in @entity56 ’s half - price sale at the taxpayers ’ expense is @entity79 , @entity80 mp for @entity81 , who claimed 49p for a doormat and 35p for a ballpoint pen			1
maybe the @entity85 , the body charged with overhauling politicians ’ pay and pensions in the wake of the 2009 expenses scandal , would now frown on the 48p claimed by former @entity92 health secretary @entity91 for a bottle of @entity95 ’ toilet cleaner			1
but equally ludicrous claims still get through the system			2
certainly , rules governing expenses have been tightened			0
mps are no longer allowed to claim , for example , the cost of cleaning , gardening or buying furniture for their designated second home			2
however , it is still possible to submit claims for a wide variety of items such as tv bills , council tax , utility bills , travel and lunch costs for interns			0
@entity92 's @entity118 was repaid 10p for some drawing pins thus , @entity121 backbencher @entity120 , who earned £ 10,000 for her belly - flop appearance on the @entity123 show splash ! , giving the fee to a run - down lido in her constituency , was able to claim 90p in expenses for a trip to the very same lido — which is in the same road as her constituency office			1
she defended herself , saying : ‘ the claim was for a staff member who used her car to make a visit to the lido as part of the support work we do with them			0
this was not a recreational visit and it is entirely reasonable that she be compensated			0
’ for three years , during the economic crisis , @entity92 ’s @entity146 was in charge of the nation ’s finances as chancellor			1
but he managed to find time to concentrate on his own finances — claiming 70p for a postage stamp and 64p for a gluestick			1
indeed , claims for stationery seem to be among the most petty			0
@entity159 , @entity92 mp for @entity160 , put in a claim for 19p for @entity163 adhesive , while @entity121 mp @entity164 ( @entity165 ) claimed 66p for ballpoint pens			1
maybe he needed them to fill out his expense forms			0
@entity169 , @entity92 ’s one - time chief secretary to the treasury , is best known for leaving his @entity171 successor a flippant note saying : ‘ sorry — there ’s no money left			1
’ but clearly he thought that taxpayers ’ munificence was not entirely exhausted , claiming back 46p for a set of post-it notes			0
taxpayers ’ hard - earned money has also been used to repay 10p to @entity92 deputy leader @entity118 ( who owns two homes ) for some drawing pins , and 34p to buy @entity182 , @entity92 ’s former home secretary , a pack of ten fold - back clips			1
meanwhile , @entity185 , @entity92 mp for @entity186 , claimed 18p on a mouse - mat for her computer			1
not to be outdone , @entity190 , @entity80 mp for @entity191 , claimed 17p for a pack of staples			2
all these claims involve work either at home or at the office , but mps also cost us money when they go on the move			2
@entity202 , @entity92 mp , claimed 29p for a packet of @entity204 and 30p for a jam doughnut former @entity121 cabinet minister @entity206 got into hot water for the cost of driving 100 yards from a cement firm to his constituency surgery			1
the sum was calculated at the 45p per mile rate which @entity11 can claim when using their own car on parliamentary business			0
in the space of a year , dr @entity206 made 15 travel claims for under £ 1			0
while other motorists complain of high parking charges , @entity218 , conservative mp for @entity219 , has no such worries			0
on five occasions she claimed 20p for parking at her constituency surgery			2
@entity225 , @entity80 mp for @entity226 , has claimed the same amount for parking in his constituency			2
and @entity230 , @entity92 mp for @entity231 on @entity232 and @entity233 , claimed 4p — the smallest possible amount for mileage — for ‘ travel within own constituency ’			1
it was a distance of just 176 yards			0
it ’s not all car travel , though			0
@entity241 , @entity92 mp for @entity242 , claimed 40p for a two - mile bike ride around his constituency			1
‘ it ’s not free to ride a bicycle , ’ he protested when challenged			0
‘ they have to be maintained			0
’ mr @entity146 was repaid 70p for a postage stamp and 64p for a gluestick while in charge of the nation 's finances after all that pedalling , it is little wonder that mps get a bit peckish , and who would deny them a light snack ? @entity202 , @entity92 mp for @entity260 , claimed 29p for a packet of @entity204 , 30p for a white chocolate cookie , 30p for a jam doughnut and 35p for a @entity265 bar			1
her high - calorie choice raised eyebrows , given that she has backed the @entity269 ’s campaign against hidden salt , fat and sugar in our diets			0
but she defended herself by arguing that she did n’t eat them — they were bought for an unpaid intern			0
however , not all claims are approved			0
@entity279 , @entity121 mp for @entity280 , saw his claim of 50p for a pint of milk rejected			0
maybe it was the extra penny that made the difference because @entity286 , mp for @entity287 , was successful after submitting a claim for 49p for a pinta on expenses , as did @entity291 , @entity80 mp for @entity292			2
while @entity293 , mp for @entity294 , felt it was his right to claim back 99p for ‘ office water ’			0
not surprisingly , such tiny claims often make front page news in mps ’ local newspapers			1
that ’s why they are avid readers of the local press			0
proof of this comes from the fact that @entity307 , conservative mp for @entity308 , claimed 75p for ‘ purchase of @entity311 newspapers ’ , while @entity312 , mp for @entity313 , enjoyed reading the @entity314 at a cost of 65p to taxpayers			2
such petty claims surely belie @entity11 ’ attempts to assure voters they have cleaned up their act			0
when tackled about the piddling amounts involved , many @entity11 ( @entity0 was one ) explained the claims were submitted by staff in their constituency office without their knowledge			1
also , the reason the amounts were so small was that the system had changed so that individual items of stationery had to be listed rather than as part of a bulk order			0
with the @entity85 scrutinising their claims as never before , some have complained at the bureaucracy involved in filling out their expense forms			0
what a shame , though , that a few more of them do n’t seem to realise it would take up a lot less of their time if they were not so obsessed with claiming for every last doughnut and paperclip .			2
