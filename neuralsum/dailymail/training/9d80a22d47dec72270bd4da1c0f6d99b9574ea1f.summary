the images were made public this week when @entity94 revealed the mystery man is now the prime suspect			0
the detective leading the @entity130 investigation is expected to travel to @entity50 in the coming weeks			0
detective chief inspector @entity131 said he was extremely pleased with the response to monday night ’s @entity14 appeal			1
‘ we have now had over 730 calls and 212 emails as a direct result of the specific lines of inquiry we issued yesterday concerning events in the lead up to , and on the night of thursday 3rd may 2007 when @entity20 was abducted , ’ he said			2
‘ detectives are now trawling through and prioritising that material			0
’ mr @entity131 , who insists mr @entity38 had nothing to do with his daughter ’s disappearance , said two independent callers had put forward the same name for the suspect			1

mr @entity131 said officers were waiting to ‘ action the information ’ and 40 people were ready to take further calls			0
with 6.7million viewers , the appeal attracted the biggest @entity14 audience on record – almost double the average of 3.9 million			1
a @entity14 spokesman said it also had the highest number of calls ever received , more than double the usual number			1
the programme ’s editor @entity170 said : ‘ significantly , there were lots of calls from @entity26 people who were in @entity36 around the time of @entity20 ’s disappearance who had never previously spoken to the @entity130 , so there ’s lots of information coming through there			1
‘ they received several names for the key 10pm sighting , the sighting of a man carrying a child toward the beach			0
‘ several different names but also several callers mentioned the same name for that man			2
’ the @entity130 is now taking the appeal to @entity193 where appeals were shown last night and a missing persons programme will be broadcast in @entity196 tonight			2
investigators are keen to trace a number of fair - haired men seen lurking around the holiday apartments at the time who could be @entity203 or @entity196			2
chilling : a scene from the @entity14 reconstruction showing the moment @entity204 discovers her daughter 's empty bed reconstruction : scenes from @entity14 's reconstruction of the events that night in may 2007 , including the three - year - old actress who played @entity215 , left a reward of up to £ 20,000 is being offered for information leading to the identification , arrest and prosecution of those responsible for @entity20 ’s abduction			1
yesterday a spokesman for the @entity35 said : ‘ we are absolutely delighted with the overwhelming public response to @entity14			1
‘ we know that the public desperately want to help the search for @entity20			2
we are genuinely hopeful that one or more of these responses will lead to a major breakthrough in the investigation			1
’ the new @entity14 appeal focused on a claim by an @entity50 family that they saw a man carrying a child through @entity36 at around the time @entity5 was found to be missing			1
two differing e-fits of the suspect were issued , and police say it is possible the family did see the three - year - old being spirited away by her abductor			2
key witness : @entity246 @entity245 , pictured , was in the resort with his family when @entity215 disappeared the sighting came when @entity245 , a retired businessman in his 70s , was walking back to his apartment in the @entity253 resort following a meal and drinks at a bar with his wife and children			0
at a spot a six - minute walk from the @entity35 ’ holiday accommodation , they saw a man carrying a blonde child aged around four			2
it was just before 10pm and the street lighting was poor			0
although mr @entity245 admitted he was not wearing his glasses at the time he later said he thought the man could have been @entity38			1
this is an impossibility as dozens of witnesses confirmed he was at the holiday complex at 10pm			0
@entity26 police have also said they are certain that mr @entity38 has nothing to do with his daughter ’s appearance			1
speaking to @entity37 police a few weeks after @entity215 disappeared , mr @entity245 said it was ‘ not possible to recognise the individual ’			0
his grandchildren were also unable to identify the man or the girl – but thought she could have been @entity20			1
yet in september 2007 mr @entity245 suddenly called police again to say he believed the man he saw could have been @entity38			1
he had been watching television coverage of the family returning to @entity26			0
however numerous witnesses say they were with mr @entity38 at the tapas restaurant at the time in question – so he could not possibly have been 500 yards away			0
this has led to mr @entity245 ’s account being called into question			0
the retired businessman from @entity62 , @entity50 , was staying in @entity36 with his wife @entity296 , now 65 , his son @entity297 and his wife and their children			0
he part owned an apartment in the resort and visited it three times a year .			0
