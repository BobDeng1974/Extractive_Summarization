another one in three happily consume food that has dropped on the floor , while one in five admit they do n’t wash their hands before preparing a meal			2
the @entity13 , which came up with the findings , says the nation needs to clean up its kitchen habits to tackle a food poisoning epidemic that strikes down more than 1.7million a year			1
danger : a third of people eat food that is past its ' use by ' date despite tests showing food poisoning bacteria is found on two thirds of fresh chicken sold on the high street ( file photo ) most concern surrounds campylobacter , which infects as many as 460,000 @entity31 every year , leading to 100 deaths			1
official research by the @entity13 shows the bug can be found on as many as two thirds of all fresh chicken on sale on the high street			2
