by @entity0 a family brawl that broke out between neighbors in @entity3 , @entity4 on sunday ended with one man being bitten not just by a pit bull , but also by the dog 's owner			1
@entity10 sheriffs say that @entity11 and his wife @entity12 were on one side of the scuffle with their 60 - year - old neighbor @entity15 , his daughter @entity16 and their 1 - year - old pit bull @entity18 on the other			1
by the end of it , the women were at each others throats down on the ground and both mr. @entity15 and @entity18 had sunk their teeth into mr. @entity11 's flesh			1
according to the @entity28 , it all began with the dog			1
write caption here mr. @entity11 , 52 , claimed to police he was out playing basketball with his sons when the ball was stuck in a tree at the edge of the @entity15 's property			1
when the boys went to retrieve it , they say @entity18 appeared and came charging at them aggressively			1
mr. @entity11 then kicked the canine and told the boys to run away			1
responding to what she said were @entity18 's screams , @entity43 , 29 , approached @entity11 and told him to back off her dog			2
just when they fight : @entity15 maintained to police that @entity18 was a good girl who only bit @entity11 whenever the two neighbors fought ( file photo ) according to the blow - by - blow police report , @entity15 then struck @entity11 in the head			2
as @entity11 shoved the woman to the ground , two things happened : @entity15 emerged to defend his daughter and @entity56 , 44 , came from her home to come to her husband 's aid			1
mutual injuries described by police indicate that the women scratched at one another and wrestled on the ground as the two men came to blows , as well			2
@entity18 stood by , police say , and became progressively agitated			2
but before the dog could bite @entity11 , mr. @entity15 allegedly did it for him			2
@entity18 followed suit and at one point @entity15 's teeth were in @entity11 's hand as the canine 's were in his leg			0
after @entity11 dislodged both attackers , he called 911			0
however , notes the @entity28 , the dispatcher had to ask to speak to mrs. @entity56 after she was unable to understand the situation through mr. @entity11 's loud obscenities			0
' i 'm bleeding to death , ' he screamed as mrs. @entity56 took the phone and explained that it was , in fact , the second time her husband had been bitten by the dog			1
police arrived to find all parties seething but none had serious injuries			0
' the only time she ’s ever bitten him is when he was fighting with me , ' @entity15 maintained			0
' she ’s a sweet dog			0
' that guy next door is always standing outside yelling at people who drive by			0
he yells at his wife and his children			1
' however , after questioning , it was the @entity102 who went to jail			0
@entity15 was charged with one count of battery causing bodily harm , while @entity16 was charged with two			0
they were both out on bail by early monday .			0
