by @entity0 published : 18:15 est , 6 february 2013 updated : 21:04 est , 6 february 2013 an almighty row broke out in @entity2 when a church procession was stopped in its tracks by a driver 's calamitous attempts at a three - point turn			1
there were plenty of raised voices and wild hand gestures as the clumsy motorist struggled to turn his white @entity13 around in the narrow street in the southern @entity17 city			1
video footage of the incident shows a priest opening his arms wide and looking to the heavens with delight when the car finally wriggles out of the tight spot			1
some got angry and shouted at the motorist , while others laughed at his expense and took pictures			0
but a few also got involved by trying to help the man and his passenger out			0
they included a police officer and traffic officals			0
the driver had started off by blocking two cars heading in opposite directions along what had been as a quiet road			2
road block : two cars arrive on the scene and their drivers soon realise the will be there for a while hold - up : a group of motorcyclists are the next to be held up by the vehicle in the narrow @entity2 street it gets worse : as if the driver was not having a bad enough day , a church procession soon arrives why me ? the motorists wonders how he got him and his passenger into such an awkward situation get out the way : the motorist was understandably frustrated at his predicament but the car became trapped in a sideways position between two parked vehicles while he attempted the painfully slow turn			1
and as horns began sounding , the tailback grew with the arrival of a group of motorcyclists , who were forced to dismount and lend a helping hand			0
the motorist 's embarrassment was confounded when the church procession appeared but was unable to pass the blockage			0
passing pedestrians also stopped and stared , while residents living in neighbouring houses emerged onto their balconies to see what all the fuss about			0
@entity111 and chants of ' @entity113 ' broke out when the driver finally completed the u-turn and was able to continue his delayed journey			1
frenzy : they crowd had a mixture of anger and amusement , with people eventually applauding the driver laughing stock : other motorists laugh at the driver 's expense and some even take pictures helping hand : a priest and traffic official attempts to help the driver out of the tricky position road rage : a passing moped rider has little sympathy for the man , who brought traffic to a standstill			2

narrow streets of southern @entity17 city prove too much for clumsy driver
@entity144 looks to the heavens with delight as the car finally gets on its way
