he is arguably @entity1 's greatest ever writer , using tens of thousands of words to craft his plays and poetry			2
scholars say @entity6 was among the most educated men of his time , using around a quarter of those words used in the @entity11 language during his lifetime			2
he invented many of the words that make up his 37 plays , but for others he turned to the @entity19 and @entity20 languages for inspiration			0
two booksellers in @entity23 believe this dictionary , which dates to 1580 , was once owned by the poet and playwright @entity6 experts say it will take months , if not years to assess whether the annotations adorning the book , were written by the @entity6			1
only six confirmed examples of his handwriting exist , making comparisons very difficult but like many contemporary writers , experts have long believed @entity6 turned to a reference book as a guide			2
today , as the literary world marks the 450th anniversary of the @entity6 's birth , two booksellers from @entity23 have revealed they may have the answer to the mystery of where he learned his vast vocabulary			1
@entity47 and @entity48 say they have discovered the writer 's dictionary , annotated by his own hand			1
for more than 50 years , experts have believed @entity6 consulted a 1580 dictionary published in @entity55 and known as @entity56 or @entity57			2
' the ordinariness of the individual annotations is , to me , precisely what argues for their authenticity ' - expert @entity64 @entity66 tutor @entity65 was responsible for publishing the dictionary , in @entity11 , @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity68 - giving it the name @entity57			2
many experts believe @entity6 could have used @entity65 's work to craft his own			1
noted @entity75 scholar @entity74 asserts in @entity6 ’s @entity76 & @entity77 : ' @entity65 was in effect the standard @entity11 dictionary of @entity6 ’s schooldays , and must have had powerful influence in shaping the @entity11 definitions of @entity6 ’s generation			2
' but it is not likely that @entity6 would have preserved the patterns so accurately if he had not himself turned many a time and oft to @entity65 for his varied synonyms			2
' and so , when in 2008 when a book bearing the 1580 publication date appeared on @entity91 , it caught the eye of mr @entity47			1
the seller 's reference to ' contemporary annotations ' , wet his appetite to find out more			0
he paid $ 4,300 for the book , the @entity23 reported			1
the 450th anniversary of the birth of @entity6 is being celebrated today			1
the @entity6 was born on april 23 , 1564 and died on the same day 52 years later @entity47 , who bought the dictionary from @entity91 for $ 4,300 in 2008 , and @entity48 haver released a book @entity104 ( pictured ) charting their discovery and arguing the case for the book once being owned by @entity6 once in his possession , he and mr @entity48 studied its annotations for clues as to the author , leading them to conclude the scribbles and markings adorning the pages are indeed those of @entity6 himself			1
the pair have published their own book , @entity104 : an @entity118 comes to light , reproducing parts of the @entity56 , while debating its authenticity			0
the pair said : ' over the course of discovery , it became impossible for us to neglect a host of personal markers that run throughout the annotated book - finger prints left by the annotator that reveal a personality and hint at an identity			0
' in addition , there is a preponderance of natural history annotations , interest in the language of clothing and costume of the period critical to stagecraft , and annotations that connect with our understanding of @entity6 ’s father and his profession			0
' but proving the dictionary is in fact that of @entity6 , could be harder than it would appear			2
he is known to have signed just six legal documents , and is thought to have hand - written only three pages of an unpublished play			0
while there is no categorical evidence of when @entity6 was born , historians widely believe today to be the 450th anniversary of his birth			1
it is known that the playwright was baptized on april 26 , 1564 and that he died on his birthday 52 years later			0
the poet and writer was born in @entity165 , the third child of eight to his middle - class parents , @entity168			0
over the next 30 years he would produce 37 plays , and countless poems and other works , making him one of the world 's most celebrated playwright five centuries later			0
across the @entity175 arts organisations have marked the 450th anniversary			2
today the @entity178 theatre in @entity179 will host a fireworks display on its rooftop , which is set to paint an eight - metre high portrait of the @entity6 in the night 's sky			1
at @entity55 's @entity184 , the @entity185 will recite all of the @entity6 's 154 sonnets as part of an all - day event			1
with so few examples of his handwriting to compare against the annotations in the dictionary , experts have questioned its authenticity			0
mr @entity47 and mr @entity48 say they have discovered annotations that suggest borrowed ideas from one of his most well - known plays @entity201			1
another antiquarian @entity64 , who had access to @entity47 and @entity48 's early work , has anaylsed the arguement that the book is @entity206			1
he said in a blog post : ' the ordinariness of the individual annotations is , to me , precisely what argues for their authenticity : they form not a rough draft of any single text , but a tool kit			0
' the connections between @entity65 ’s word store and the plays and poems all point to the transformation that occurs in the space between an author ’s notes and composition : the play of language			0
' but others have urged caution , throwing doubt on the idea that the annotations were penned by the playwright			0
of the six confirmed fragments of @entity6 's handwriting only the words ' by me ' and his signature ' @entity6 ' were written by him			1
the @entity240 in @entity241 is the largest collection of printed @entity6 material in the world			0
it also has a huge archive of handwritten and printed material from the @entity6 's contemporaries			1
the library 's director @entity250 , and curator of manuscripts @entity254 , said in a blog on monday that they can not yet get excited about the alleged new piece of @entity6 's history , the @entity249 reported			1
' at this point , ' they write , ' we as individual scholars feel that it is premature to join @entity47 and @entity48 in what they have described as their " leap of faith "			1
' they said there are a number of different research methods that experts must use to confirm the identity of the dictionary 's annotator			2
responding the the sceptisim the @entity274 in @entity241 holds the largest collection of printed @entity6 material in the world the library 's director @entity250 , and curator of manuscripts @entity254 said in a blog that they feel it is ' premature to join @entity47 and @entity282 in what they have described as their " leap of faith "			1
' they include paleography , or the study of old script			0
the handwriting used to mark the dictionary is italic - style			0
almost all of the existing examples of @entity6 's handwriting are in another style , ' secretary '			1
mr @entity250 and ms @entity254 say other writers in the 16th century are known to have used examples of both italic and secretary , keeping alive the possibility it is @entity206			0
verifying @entity6 as the owner of the book is likely to take months , if not years , of research before experts will be confident to say beyond any doubt that the @entity6 himself scrawled the notes in the margins as he wrote his great masterpieces			1
responding the the skepticism mr @entity47 and mr @entity282 added : ' the question is , does it make sense to imagine any book extensively written in by @entity6 to realistically survive entirely unnoticed to the present day			2
' in simplest terms ( our claim ) goes as follows : with @entity65 ’s @entity56 we are faced with a book that has not once been reprinted since 1580			0
' an extensive network of annotations that , through obscurity and a lack of attention , comes to light only now , never previously studied or speculated upon			0
' these are the basic stepping ­ ‐ stones to providing plausibility to the dream that such a monumental discovery is possible			0
the rest is in the evidence			0

today is the 450th anniversary of @entity6 's birth
scholars say the @entity6 used more than *30,000* words to craft his works
@entity47 and @entity48 claim to have the poet 's dictionary
@entity47 *spotted* the book on @entity91 and bought it for $ 4,300 in 2008
experts at the @entity274 said in - depth study is needed to verify owner
