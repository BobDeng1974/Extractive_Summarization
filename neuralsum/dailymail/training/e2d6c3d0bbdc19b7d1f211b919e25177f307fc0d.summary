by @entity0 @entity2 farewell : a relaxed @entity3 arrives at 10 @entity4 yesterday @entity3 , a titan of @entity7 politics for more than four decades , quit the @entity8 last night with a parting blast over @entity10			1
the minister without portfolio – who has previously served as chancellor , home secretary , health secretary , education secretary and justice secretary – told @entity15 that , at 74 , he wanted to become a ‘ veteran backbencher ’			1
and he warned mr @entity15 that he intended to campaign ‘ vigorously ’ for @entity17 to remain in the @entity18 ahead of the prime minister ’s promised referendum			1
mr @entity3 said the case for staying in the @entity18 was ‘ stronger ’ than ever in a ‘ dangerously disturbed ’ world and an increasingly globalised economy			1
his @entity10 views – out of step with the prevailing mood of @entity27 – are widely seen to have cost him the party leadership , which he stood for on three occasions between 1997 and 2005			0
the veteran mp for @entity32 , who has held office in every @entity7 government since 1972 , has been joking with colleagues in recent days that he was looking forward to watching more cricket			2
and he told @entity37 last night that he had been ‘ demob - happy ’ for several weeks			0
returning to his beloved cricket , he said he had enjoyed a ‘ good long innings ’ and confessed that he had spent far more time watching @entity40 ’s first test against @entity41 at @entity42 last week than in his office			0
‘ i thought i ’d do a couple of years in this government			0
that was the agreement i had with @entity15 [ @entity15 ]			0
i ’ve done four and that ’s obviously enough , and it makes sense to have a reshuffle , ’ mr @entity3 said			1
law student : a young @entity3 at @entity53 minister : in the year he left the @entity55 to be employment secretary chancellor : outside no 11 downing street during his four years leading the treasury contender : enjoying a pint and a cigar as he runs for the @entity7 leadership as a ‘ life - long addict to politics ’ , he said he was ‘ as keen as ever ’ to carry on as an mp and promised to be ‘ largely supportive ’ of the government from the backbenches			1
mr @entity3 , who entered parliament in 1970 and secured his first job as a whip in 1972 in @entity72 ’s government , was brought back to the @entity7 frontbench in 2009 at the behest of chancellor @entity75			1
he had been on the backbenches throughout the @entity7 wilderness years after 1997 , not serving under @entity78 , @entity79 or @entity80			0
his appointment as shadow business secretary was designed to counter @entity84 ’s surprise decision to bring back one of @entity87 ’s big beasts , @entity85 , to the @entity8			2
last night , mr @entity3 wrote to mr @entity15 telling him : ‘ i would wish to retire from ministerial office in your government ’			2
he said he had ‘ greatly enjoyed ’ his return in a government ‘ that has had to face the worst financial crisis of my lifetime , and the aftermath of the deepest and longest recession since the war ’			0
he added : ‘ i believe that we have saved the country from economic disaster , although we have a long way to go before we have the modern , healthy and competitive economy that the next generation needs			0
‘ i have always been a radical reformer of public services and i think that people will look back on our achievements in modernising the health service and education service and the welfare system in a favourable way			0
’ he added : ‘ however , i have just celebrated my 74th birthday and i have been doing red boxes at night for a high proportion of my adult life			0
there are plenty of other able people who could take on the work that i was doing in @entity89 and i think the time has come to return to being a veteran backbencher			1
’ mr @entity3 gave notice to the prime minister that he intends to remain ‘ an active ’ member of the @entity125			2
‘ my belief in @entity17 ’s membership of the @entity18 remains as firm as ever and i think the political and economic case is made even stronger in today ’s globalised economy and dangerously disturbed world , ’ he said			1
‘ i know that you are quite determined to have a referendum on the subject , in which i will be campaigning vigorously for a vote to keep us in the @entity18			2
’ @entity137 , mr @entity3 ’s parliamentary private secretary , said : ‘ he is the most honest politician i have ever met			1

the *stalwart* politician , 74 , told @entity85 he wants to be a ' veteran backbencher '
he said @entity18 is as necessary as ever in a ' dangerously disturbed ' world
@entity3 says he will be ' largely supportive ' of @entity89 from backbenches
