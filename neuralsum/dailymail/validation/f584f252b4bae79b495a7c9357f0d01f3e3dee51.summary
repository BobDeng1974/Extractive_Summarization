he has become used to rewriting the record books these past few years , amending football history in style with wonderful goals and dazzling pieces of skill			0
but there 's one record @entity9 has some way to go to break - one held by @entity13 's very own @entity12			1
it is the all - time leading goalscorer list across @entity15 's top five divisions - @entity13 , @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 - but at least the @entity21 wizard is making progress up the ladder			1
@entity9 ( right ) is congratulated by team - mate @entity24 after scoring for @entity21 in their 3 - 1 win over @entity26 at the weekend - it moved him to 269 goals in the @entity16 league @entity9 's close - range finish took him into the top 10 all - time goalscorers list for @entity15 's top five leagues @entity12 , seen here playing for @entity33 in 1967 , leads the chart with 366 league goals @entity9 's goal in @entity21 's 3 - 1 win at @entity26 on saturday was his 269th in the @entity16 league and took him into the top 10 of the all - time standings for league goals , as pointed out by @entity41 on @entity42			1
however , he is still some way behind @entity12 ' tally of 366 league goals set between 1957 and 1971			0
the prolific @entity13 international striker scored 357 goals for @entity48 , @entity33 and @entity49 in the @entity51 top flight , plus nine for @entity52 in @entity53 it set some precedent , one almost matched by @entity56 , who scored 365 goals for @entity58 in the @entity19 top flight and is second in the table			2
there is then a gap to the pre-war @entity51 scoring duo of @entity64 ( 317 @entity66 goals between 1892 and 1914 ) and @entity67 ( 310 between 1924 and 1938 )			0
@entity19 legend @entity56 is second on the all - time list , just one goal behind @entity12 @entity9 's rival , @entity71 of @entity72 , is sixth on the goalscorers list @entity74 , with his familiar celebration for @entity76 , comes in eighth on the list with 283 goals one man @entity9 will be desperate to catch is his rival @entity71 , currently sixth in the list with 291 goals in @entity15 's top five leagues - 84 for @entity84 in the @entity85 and 207 for @entity72 in @entity86			1
@entity74 is eighth , with 283 goals for @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity76 in the @entity51 top flight			0
if they continue at their present free - scoring rate , it 's highly likely @entity71 and @entity9 will one day be topping this list			2
but the key question remains - in which order will they finish ?			0
