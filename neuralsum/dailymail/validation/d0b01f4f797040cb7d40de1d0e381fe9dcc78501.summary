' the @entity1 - @entity13 thing has to work at some point , but @entity4 is so difficult now			1
there is so much technology and you are taking on so many strong teams			0
' i expect a modest beginning , but from whatever they start at you want to see a trajectory which is pushing to regular top sixes and a podium at the end of the season			0
