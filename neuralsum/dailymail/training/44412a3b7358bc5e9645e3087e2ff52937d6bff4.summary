young parliamentary researchers last night claimed their parents would be ‘ horrified ’ if they knew the lurid truth of what goes on at the ‘ @entity4 ’			1
one aide said there were rumours of mps and peers using date rape drugs on junior activists , or paying for abortions after getting their staff pregnant			1
others claimed former ministers had been accused of manhandling women on the @entity17 and that sex acts and drug - taking regularly took place in toilets			0
yesterday there were calls for an urgent overhaul of @entity25 ’s late - night drinking culture to prevent more damaging sleaze scandals from engulfing @entity27			1
the @entity25 - or the ' @entity4 ' as it 's been dubbed after a string of scandals - is rife with rumours of mps acting inappropriately towards their young staff members the comments come two days after @entity34 , the former deputy speaker , was unanimously cleared of a series of sexual assaults			1
the case shone a light on the drink - fuelled culture at @entity25 – which has been labelled the ‘ @entity4 ’ after a string of sexual harassment allegations			1
a study released at the end of the trial also found that a third of researchers said they had been subjected to harassment			1
the claims come just two days after former deputy speaker @entity34 was unanimously cleared at the end of his trial for a string of sexual offences yesterday the @entity53 researcher who gave evidence against mr @entity34 decided to lift the lid on the reality of life in ‘ the @entity25 bubble ’			1
he said colleagues – many of whom were straight out of university – were often so desperate to progress in their careers that they did not report sexual assaults			1
the 35 - year - old , who had claimed mr @entity34 had put his hand down his trousers at a @entity53 conference in 2003 but was brought to court despite insisting he was not a victim , added : ‘ i think an awful lot of parents of people who work in @entity27 would be horrified if they saw the reality of what life in the @entity25 bubble is like			1
’ the @entity53 activist , who is married , added : ‘ @entity27 needs to get a grip on this alcohol - fuelled sleaze before it brews into something worse than the expenses scandal that destroys all trust in mps			1
there is a problem and the politicians need to act			0
otherwise a story will come out that starts an onslaught that makes the accusations we have heard in the last few weeks seem like small fry			2
’ he said politicians work long hours away from their families and are surrounded by ‘ impressionable straight - out - of - university ambitious people ’			0
‘ it ’s a recipe for an awful lot of borderline people to be pushed over the edge and unfortunately that gives all mps a bad name , ’ he said			2
he did not know if rumours of mps using date rape drugs and paying for abortions were true , but said he heard allegations ‘ all of the time ’			1
‘ most of these will be largely untrue , but there will be some reason why that rumour started in the first place , ’ he added			0
‘ i think the sleazy nature of mps hanging around with people who are just out of university , it does not look good			2
‘ we ’re now living in an age when everyone ’s got a camera in their pocket			0
at some point someone is going to take a photo in the @entity127 ’ bar of someone behaving in a way they should n’t and it ’s going to balloon and some very serious allegations will come forward , and by that point it will be too late and @entity27 will have to act			0
’ chief whip sir @entity135 , left , wrote to mps asking them to sign up to a code of ethics regarding the treatment of staff , while the speaker , @entity142 , right , has set up a helpline for staff he is now calling for bars in @entity27 to have 9pm curfews for researchers			1
‘ you ’ve got bars where people know each other , relatively cheap alcohol , and a lot of people who are up for a good gossip and like a bit of scandal , ’ he added			0
‘ a lot of people like that atmosphere , but it is clearly causing problems			0
‘ some parliamentary staff do actively encourage mps to behave in a certain way , and the only reason @entity163 behave in that way is because on some occasions that behaviour may have resulted in “ success ”			1
’ another man who made allegations about mr @entity34 , who was unanimously cleared on all counts by a jury at @entity174 on thursday , said there was no proper way to deal with complaints			1
he told @entity178 : ‘ the strange thing about @entity27 is that they make the laws but they do n’t act like any other place of business			0
@entity53 mp sir @entity184 argued there was no need for a voluntary code of conduct ‘ researchers and mps ’ staff do n’t have an @entity190 department			1
our bosses are technically self - employed and we ’re all small businesses so even though we work in one big building together there was no mechanism to deal with this problem , and there still is n’t			0
’ even last night there were rumours circulating @entity27 that a former minister , who until recently was married , was reported to party whips after making a pass at a straight male mp			2
two male researchers , now mps , also allegedly fought after one said his drink was spiked and woke to find that he was being raped by the other			2
conservative party chiefs yesterday released a code of conduct for mps			2
sir @entity135 , the chief whip , wrote to mps to urge them to sign up to the code , which said staff should be treated with ‘ dignity , respect and courtesy ’ and should be ‘ free from any form of discrimination , victimisation , harassment or bullying ’			1
they should also not have to endure ‘ unwelcome behaviour and inappropriate language ’			0
but it has been criticised for telling mps that grievances are ‘ entirely a matter for you to handle ’			2
one researcher told the @entity234 : ‘ how is that going to work ? if you have a problem with your boss , you do n’t exactly feel comfortable with telling them about it , particularly if your career is entirely in their hands			0
’ however , a @entity53 source said staff would still be able to go to a ‘ pastoral care unit ’ and would also be encouraged to speak to party whips			2
commons speaker @entity142 has also set up a helpline for staff			0
@entity53 mp sir @entity184 argued there was no need for a voluntary code of conduct and laughed it off , saying : ‘ i ’ve tried my best to behave			0
’ he told the @entity253 @entity252 that boorish behaviour did not dominate the @entity255 , adding that ‘ people act out of line in any profession ’			0
on thursday , a @entity260 investigation named ‘ @entity261 ’ found nearly a quarter of researchers from all parties had witnessed or heard about sex harassment .			0

@entity25 has been dubbed ' @entity4 ' after a string of scandals
rumours of mps acting inappropriately are rife , even accusations of using date rape drugs and paying for abortions after getting staff pregnant
claims come two days after @entity34 was cleared of sexual assault
study claims a third of @entity25 aides have witnesses *harrassment*
there are calls for the drinking culture to be *reined* in
