by @entity0 published : 08:06 est , 5 october 2012 updated : 08:42 est , 5 october 2012 a condo developer in @entity2 wants to tear down a historic mansion built for the grandson of @entity5 , as it ’s impeding the development of their property			1
but members of a @entity11 historic society have come up with a unique option – offering the opulent @entity13 to someone who appreciates its historic ties , for free			1
the only stipulation is that the buyer most front around $ 350,000 to move the mansion to a different neighbourhood in the area			1
and of course , the sundry renovations are n’t free , either			1
eminent domain ? a condo association in @entity2 is trying to obtain the land where the @entity28 mansion now stands old hat : the 1924 @entity31 mansion was moved once before in 1997 ; a conservation group is offering the mansion for free to anyone who will pay to move it the federal revival house was built on @entity37 in @entity2 in 1924 for @entity38 , who was a prominent attorney in @entity2 and a descendent of the third president of the @entity41			1
preservationists at the @entity43 have tried to spread the word			0
@entity45 , a @entity46 attorney , told the @entity47 that the costs of repair are too much of an unknown for prospective buyers			2
the condominiums , painted a pale shade of yellow and standing storeys above the mansion , were built in 1997			2
as part of their contract , they moved the house 35 feet away from the development to comply with zoning regulations			2
the association which owns the units claim the historic house is in poor condition , and are filing with the @entity68 to tear it down and instead replace it with an open - air pavilion for residents of the condos			1
fixer - upper : the house has been uninhabited for 25 years , after its last resident died ; here , the shutters show obvious signs of wear historic : the house was built by @entity5 's grandson , who was a prominent lawyer but between the two sides , the 2500 @entity80 has an agreement to hold up – when they built the condos 15 years ago , they were required to move the house			1
family ties : @entity38 was the scion of president @entity5 , pictured they were also required to renovate it , according to @entity87			0
the house has been empty some 25 years , since its previous owner passed away in the 1980s			2
from there , it became a popular venue for weddings , and was granted historic status in 1990			0
the condos were allowed to be built if and only if they preserved the house			0
@entity2 , like many places in the country , did not have a solid preservation movement in place until well after the 1960s , meaning that many historical buildings from bygone eras have been flattened to make way for newer constructions			0
the preservation society told the @entity47 that they ’ve had several prospective buyers , but no bites yet			0
they said the poor economy is n’t helping			0
they also said the condo association will not let engineers and architects inspect the property to discern how much work the property actually needs			1
