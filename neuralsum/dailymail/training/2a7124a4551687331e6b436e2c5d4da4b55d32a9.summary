by @entity0 published : 11:34 est , 1 may 2013 updated : 10:20 est , 3 may 2013 with their lithe golden legs , perfect figures and stunning looks , the @entity2 models are girls that most of us would love to resemble			0
but although mimicking the girls ' gazelle - like limbs and towering height might not be within reach of most of us , you can at least get the @entity2 make - up look thanks to a new online tutorial			1
the video , which stars top @entity18 make - up artist , @entity19 , and @entity21 @entity20 shows you how to get what the company describes as ' the modern @entity26 bombshell ' look			1
' @entity30 is all about being sexy so start the look with the black pencil , ' explains @entity42			1
' work it into the eyelid			0
you do n't have to be precise at this moment - this is just to get the shape			2
' next , she continues , wing it out then work it into the inner corner of the eye and underneath as well			0
follow by smudging the liner to create a classic smoky eye			2
' finish off the eye using the @entity56 in @entity57 , ' adds @entity42			0
' i 'm not using the green , just the bronze tones			0
use the base colour just in the inner corner , blending it outwards.then go over the eyeliner a little bit at a time and then working it into the eyelid			0
this look is all about blending so no hard lines			0
' @entity42 then goes on to give @entity70 a suitably supermodel-esque glow , dusting highlighter across the model 's cheekbones and dabbing a little onto the cupid 's bow			2
despite being just 24 , model @entity77 is a @entity80 's @entity79 veteran and has been an @entity81 since 2008 almost complete : @entity19 puts the finishing touches to @entity20 's smouldering @entity26 bombshell beauty look ' then , ' she concludes , ' i 'm going to use a tiny bit of the bronzer just to give a little bit of contour and then a little bit of the blush just to give some colour to the cheeks			1
' one of the @entity18 's top make - up artists , @entity42 ’s career has seen her work for a veritable who 's who of fashion photography , including @entity99 , @entity100 and @entity101			1
along with her work for @entity2 , @entity19 has also created make - up looks for designer brands such as @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 and @entity109			1
' 24 - year - old @entity20 , meanwhile , has made a name for herself on the catwalk at @entity112 , @entity113 , @entity114 and @entity115 among others			2
despite her youth , the @entity118 model is a @entity80 's @entity79 veteran and has worked with the brand since 2008			1
