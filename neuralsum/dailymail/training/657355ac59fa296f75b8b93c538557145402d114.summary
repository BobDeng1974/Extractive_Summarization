by @entity0 for the @entity1 follow @ @ @entity2 @entity3 are mounting an audacious bid to lure the @entity5 back for a one - off match in 2017 , prior to the tourists ' arrival in @entity9			1
the @entity11 and @entity12 team completed a full tour @entity14 just a year ago - culminating in an epic 2 - 1 @entity16 triumph			1
ordinarily , they would not return to @entity3 for another 12 years , in 2025 , but the @entity18 are attempting to accelerate their next visit			1
last year 's tour featured a warm - up match against the @entity22 in @entity23 as a stop - off on the journey south			1
@entity26 raises the @entity27 aloft after the @entity5 won the 2013 @entity29 series in @entity3 the @entity5 are thought to be considering a similar fixture in 2017 and the @entity31 have made contact to raise the possibility of that game taking place on their shores			2
@entity18 chief executive , @entity37 , said : ' that 's one of the conversations we 've been having with them ( @entity5 officials )			1
if they want preliminary games outside @entity9 then we would be a wonderful location for them			0
we would take it in a heartbeat			0
' while the prospect of a match between the @entity5 and the @entity51 is unlikely in the midst of a @entity54 season , alternative options are being discussed			0
@entity18 chief executive @entity37 ( right ) is keen to bring the @entity5 back @entity56 in 2017 the @entity18 would be desperate to land the fixture as a source of considerable revenue , at a time when they are struggling both financially and in terms of public support			2
last weekend , a meagre crowd of 15,000 attended the test between @entity3 and @entity66 on the @entity67			0
the lack of june tours next year , ahead of the @entity70 , will cause further monetary problems			0
the @entity5 were heavily criticised for their stop - off in @entity73 last year , when players had to contend with extreme levels of humidity to fulfil a fixture which was widely seen as being a commercial exercise to satisfy sponsors @entity79 - who are based in @entity23			2
@entity3 's @entity81 makes a break during the test match against @entity66 in @entity67 last weekend it also reflected a lack of suitable opposition in @entity3 , whereas @entity9 could provide a greater spread of meaningful warm - up matches			1
in 2005 , the tour to @entity9 was preceded by a game against @entity66 in @entity91 designed to raise funds to pay for the trip .			0

the @entity18 are keen for the @entity5 to play a match down under ahead of the @entity9 tour
the @entity5 are currently not *scheduled* to return to @entity3 until 2025
last year 's @entity16 in @entity3 ended in a 2 - 1 victory for the @entity5
