a @entity1 company has unveiled its innovative bike for children that never falls over			1
called the @entity4 , it makes clever use of gyroscopes to keep the bike balanced even when a child leans from side - to - side			1
according to the company , this means a child can learn to ride the bike in just one day			1
the @entity4 ( pictured ) claims to offer children a fast and easy method to learn how to ride a bicycle			2
a rapidly spinning disc inside the front wheel acts as a gyroscope that stabilises the bike when a kid leans from side to side so that they do n't fall over , and it can be controlled remotely by a parent the @entity4 , which is currently part of a @entity27 campaign , works on the principle that a bike is more stable at higher speeds			1
inside the front wheel of the bicycle is a fast spinning disc			1
@entity35 power : 14.4 watts battery life : 3 - 4 hours @entity38 flywheel speed : 2,000 @entity39 weight : 3 kilograms ( 6.6 pounds ) size : 12 or 16 inches ( 30 or 40 centimetres ) connectivity : @entity43 water resistant : yes this creates a gyroscopic force that balances the bike even when it is ridden slowly , as might be expected for a child getting behind the handlebars for the first time			0
a ‘ control hub ’ in the front wheel dictates how the gyroscope acts			2
this can also be bought separately and attached to another bike			0
it can change the rate that the disc in the front wheel spins to give a rider different levels of stability			2
this means as a rider improves , the assistance can be toned down			0
and ultimately , once they are comfortable , the spinning disc can be removed to reduce the weight of the front wheel by 60 per cent			1
there are two versions of the bike available ; the smaller 12 - inch ( 30 centimetres ) version costs £ 179 ( $ 249 ) , while the larger 16 - inch ( 40 centimetres ) bike is £ 219 ( $ 299 )			0
as seen here the @entity4 is stable even when it is given a gentle push and it is allowed to move by itself with the gyroscope inside the front wheel enabled a remote control can be used to alter the ' control hub ' in the front wheel of the bike			1
this means a parent can change the stability assistance afforded to a child as they ride			0
this means as a rider improves , the assistance can be toned down , or it can be turned up if they are struggling ‘ the genius behind our technology is that it covertly promotes correct riding technique , ’ the company said on their @entity27 page			0
‘ it takes the stress out of teaching , eliminates fears of falling and gets the whole family out riding together faster than trial and error , balance bikes or training wheels			0
’ the speed of the spinning disc in the front tyre can also be adjusted remotely , so an adult can quickly increase the stability if their child is far away and looks like they are about to fall , for example			1
the disc inside the bike can be charged with a @entity43 cable and lasts for about three hours , and the software inside can also be updated by connecting it to a computer			0
production on the @entity4 is due to start ' soon ' and it is expected to hit the market in january 2015			1
and next year the company also hopes to build an adult version that uses the same technology in a larger bike to help older people learn how to ride			2
the @entity4 , which is currently part of a @entity27 campaign , works on the principle that a bike is more stable at higher speeds			2
inside the front wheel of the bicycle is a fast spinning disc that creates a gyroscopic force ( pictured ) to balance the bike even when it is ridden slowly the @entity4 is available to preorder now at the company 's @entity27 page , with production expected to begin later this year			1
the first bikes will be shipped in january 2015			0
the company also hopes to design a larger version of the bike next year that can be used by adults learning to ride			0

a @entity1 - based company is *seeking* *funding* for its @entity4
using gyroscopes it lets kids learn how to ride without falling over
the bike has a rapidly spinning disc in its front wheel that makes it stable
this means the bike stays upright when a child leans from side to side
production begins later this year and it will be on sale in january 2015
