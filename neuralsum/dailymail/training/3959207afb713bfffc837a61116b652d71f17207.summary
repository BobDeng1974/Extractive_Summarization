by @entity0 ordeal : @entity2 , 83 , was held in a cell for seven hours and forced to give dna samples as he was accused of poisoning his wife of 60 years @entity6 a grandfather arrested and banned from seeing his wife after he gave her a painkiller patch at her care home said last night he had been treated like ‘ a hardened drug dealer ’			1
@entity2 , 83 , had attached the prescription patch to her arm after she told him that she had been left in severe discomfort by arthritis			1
but staff at @entity18 , in @entity19 , @entity20 , where the dementia sufferer has been living , contacted police because the patch contained morphine			1
four days later mr @entity2 – who had been his wife @entity6 ’s only carer for 15 years before she became seriously ill and went into the home – was arrested on suspicion of ‘ administering a noxious substance ’			1
he was even locked up for seven hours in a police cell			1
but only after a two - month police probe has he finally been cleared of wrongdoing			1
yesterday the @entity32 veteran – who has lost weight and struggled to sleep since his arrest – said : ‘ this whole sorry business has been hanging over me for months and i think the way it has been dealt with is absolutely disgusting			2
‘ i ’ve had a hell of a time and been treated as if i was like some kind of hardened drug dealer			0
‘ i ’ve never committed a crime in my 83 years and for this to happen is mind - boggling			2
‘ for the police to say i ’ve tried to harm my wife is unbelievable			1
‘ she had complained of arthritis in her arm and i said i had a pain patch in my pocket so i put it on her arm			2
‘ i used to look after her 24 hours a day so i know what she can and ca n’t have			2
’ support : @entity2 and @entity6 , now both 83 , pictured ( left ) on holiday in @entity58 in 1960 and ( right ) at a wedding in 1993			1
@entity2 had been @entity6 's only carer for two years before she went into a home in april he said : ‘ i have never been in a cell before			1
i ’ve only seen stuff like that on tv			0
‘ i never had anything to eat from morning to night when i was in the cell			0
’ mr @entity2 was asked to give fingerprints and a @entity69 sample and his house was searched , before he was interviewed by officers at midnight			1
he was eventually released and taken home at 1am but as part of his bail conditions he was barred from contacting his wife of 60 years			2
the retired @entity77 aerospace aircraft engineer later had his bail conditions relaxed slightly so that he could see his wife – but only if accompanied by a social worker , who was not always available			2
he added : ‘ i ’ve been missing my wife greatly because before of all this			0
alert : staff at @entity18 care home in @entity19 , @entity20 , alerted police after mr @entity2 went home ‘ i used to be allowed see her every day but after my arrest i was told not to contact her at all			1
‘ i was allowed to visit her later but only under supervision with someone watching over us			0
‘ two or three days per week i had no one to go to the care home with me so i was restrained from seeing my wife			1
then on monday when i went to the police station they told me there was no case to answer			0
‘ they said all accusations had been dropped			0
why could n’t that have happened after two weeks ? it ’s been an absolutely horrendous three months			0
’ instead , officers from the @entity105 started an investigation and a ‘ multi-agency strategy meeting ’ was held			0
detective superintendent @entity108 said : ‘ this was a potentially serious incident in which a vulnerable elderly woman with significant health issues could have come to serious harm and , as such , people would expect the police to always conduct a thorough investigation			0
‘ an integral part of the inquiry was to safeguard the potential victim and , while the investigation was ongoing , bail conditions were necessary to ensure this happened			0
‘ after twice interviewing the 83 - year - old man , we presented a file of evidence to the @entity127 and they ruled there is insufficient evidence to proceed to a charge			0
’ a spokesman for @entity18 said : ‘ we strictly follow the guidelines with regard to patient care and protection to ensure they receive the highest standard of care			0
