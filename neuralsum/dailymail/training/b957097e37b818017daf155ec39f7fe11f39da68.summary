a mysterious ‘ magic island ’ has appeared out of nowhere in radar images of a sea on @entity3 's giant moon , @entity4			1
scientists are struggling to explain the bright ‘ transient feature ’ but say it could be the result of waves , bubbles or buoyant solid matter			1
the object was spotted by flipping between images of @entity14 , @entity4 's second - largest sea , captured by the @entity15 which has been exploring the @entity3 system since 2004			1
then the enigmatic object , dubbed ‘ magic island ’ by scientists , suddenly materialised - only to vanish away in later images			1
planetary scientist @entity35 , from @entity36 in @entity37 , said : ‘ this discovery tells us that the liquids in @entity4 's northern hemisphere are not simply stagnant and unchanging , but rather that changes do occur			1
‘ we do n't know precisely what caused this ' magic island ' to appear , but we 'd like to study it further			0
’ @entity4 is the only planetary body in the @entity47 besides @entity48 known to have large expanses of liquid on its surface			2
perspective : a wider @entity54 photograph of @entity4 's north polar sea @entity14 , captured by the @entity15 probe comparison : @entity4 has weather systems similar to those of watery @entity48 , with wind and rain carving out strikingly familiar landscapes but unlike on @entity48 , they do not consist of water			1
@entity4 's seas , the size of @entity48 's @entity65 , are formed by flowing rivers of liquid methane and ethane			1
essentially , they are made from lighter fuel			0
with its thick atmosphere and organic - rich chemistry , @entity4 resembles a frozen version of @entity48 several billion years ago , before life began pumping oxygen into our atmosphere			2
because @entity4 is smaller than @entity48 , its gravity does n’t hold onto its gaseous envelope as tightly , so the atmosphere extends 370 miles into space			2
as on @entity48 , the climate is driven mostly by changes in the amount of sunlight that come with the seasons , although the seasons on @entity4 are about seven @entity48 years long			0
@entity4 's ‘ water ’ is liquid methane , @entity90 , better known on @entity48 as natural gas			1
regular @entity48 - water , @entity94 , would be frozen solid on @entity4 where the surface temperature is -180 ° @entity96 with @entity4 's low gravity and dense atmosphere , methane raindrops could grow twice as large as @entity48 's raindrops			1
as well as this , they would fall more slowly , drifting down like snowflakes			0
scientists think it rains perhaps only every few decades			0
beneath @entity4 's thick , hazy atmosphere , scientists have also discovered icy mountains and dunes made from organic ‘ sand ’			1
@entity4 has weather systems similar to those of watery @entity48 , with wind and rain carving out strikingly familiar landscapes			0
@entity116 , a @entity118 probe deployed from @entity15 , landed on @entity4 in january 2005 - the first spacecraft landing ever accomplished in the outer @entity47			2
the craft touched down on a flat , damp , sandy plain covered with ice pebbles			0
details of the ‘ magic island ’ discovery are published in the journal @entity127			0
astronomers think the strange feature may arise from changing seasons			0
the main theories are winds kicking up and forming waves , pictured as a kind of ‘ ghost ’ island in the radar images , bubbles formed by gases pushing out from the sea floor , and floating or suspended solids			2
‘ likely , several different processes - such as wind , rain and tides - might affect the methane and ethane lakes on @entity4 , ’ said mr @entity35			2
‘ we want to see the similarities and differences from geological processes that occur here on @entity48			0
ultimately , it will help us to understand better our own liquid environments			0
