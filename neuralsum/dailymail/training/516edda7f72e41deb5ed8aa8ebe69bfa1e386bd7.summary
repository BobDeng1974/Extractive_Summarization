by @entity0 published : 06:21 est , 5 march 2014 updated : 09:38 est , 5 march 2014 some of @entity3 's eeriest underground wonders have been captured by a photographer with an obsession with the deep			2
@entity7 , from @entity8 , @entity9 , crawls through sewers and mineshafts to snap the haunting images			1
he heads to daunting locations such as @entity14 's sprawling miles of underground sewers and disused cooling towers , some of which remain almost exactly as they were left when they were abandoned			1
a photographer has captured these eerie images showing the scale of some of @entity23 deepest darkest wonders - such as the @entity25 , @entity26 @entity7 , from @entity8 , @entity30 , heads to daunting locations such as abandoned mine shafts , @entity14 's miles upon miles of sewers and even disused cooling towers - this incredible image was captured by the photographer as he was looking down the ladder of a disused gasometer @entity25 , in @entity26 , has been worked since @entity35 , but closed in 1968			1
mr @entity7 said : he said : ' i 've long held a fascination with interesting spaces , and the way that we relate to them ' the photographer said some of the seemingly endless tunnels were so dark that even experienced map readers would struggle to navigate their way around			1
due to each tunnel 's similarity and the fact it 's pitch black it 's also extremely difficult to capture his amazing shots			2
some of mr @entity7 's best work has come from the now - abandoned @entity25 , @entity26 , which ceased operation in 1968			1
before then the mine had been used to extract @entity56 for the city of @entity59 's buildings since the @entity35 occupation of @entity3			2

mr @entity7 added : ' after seeing a photo of the @entity65 chamber in @entity25 i knew i had to experience such areas for myself ' the photographer - pictured here in the sewer network beneath the @entity70 , @entity14 , has come across abandoned cranes , wells , ventilation shafts , work benches , tools and even the rubbish from workers ' meals , more than 45 years on he said some of his best work has come from the now - abandoned @entity25			1
it is one of the largest limestone quarries in the country as well as being able to capture the sheer scale of such shaft , mr @entity7 and his friends also stumble across many of the original features that still exist in such mines			2

the awesome size of a cooling tower , captured from the ground			0
the photographer uses only the natural light available at each location , with stunning results a huge 19th century hall complete with ornate decoration is light and airy			0
but thephotographer said some of the seemingly endless tunnels were so dark that even experienced map readers would struggle to navigate their way around @entity7 said he was inspired by his fascination in abandoned places : ' ever wondered what people have forgotten about ? or @entity127 s in that old derelict house that you walk by everyday ? or what lies just beyond that fence on the brow of the hill ? so have i ' ' the sheer size of the network can seem a little daunting			1
to go in there without a map and backup torches and batteries would be suicide			0
' even those that are adept at map reading with heightened spatial awareness can become confused by the maze of endless junctions , dead ends , passages and markings			0
' the tunnels i go into are usually completely pitch black			0
the only light available for photographing with is what little you can carry			0
with this in mind , i 'm happy with the photos i 've taken			0

@entity7 's fascination with the deep has led him to daunting locations such as abandoned mine shafts
he has *explored* @entity14 's sewer network , abandoned mines in @entity59 , disused wells and *cathedral* chambers
during his *adventures* he has come across leftover work benches , tools and even the rubbish from workers ' meals
the haunting images are mainly captured in the dark as the *adventurer* navigates his way around tunnels and holes
