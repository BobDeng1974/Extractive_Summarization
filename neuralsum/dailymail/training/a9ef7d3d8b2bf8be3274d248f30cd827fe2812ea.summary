' i called them @entity44 tantrums - it was like watching a five - year - old stamping and shouting , ' he added			0

on much rarer occasions it was a full stomp the feet and shout			0
generally it was a hissy fit , not a full - on shouting match , a complaint , a bit of attention seeking , ' he went on			0
' what i call a @entity44 tantrum covered a wide spectrum from the full blown row to a little ‘ look at me ’ attention seeking , ' mr @entity9 added			0
