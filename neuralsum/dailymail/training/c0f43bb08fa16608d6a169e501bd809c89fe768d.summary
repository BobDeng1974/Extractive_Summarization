by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 20:53 est , 29 march 2013 updated : 20:54 est , 29 march 2013 @entity3 's sufferer @entity4 , with her son @entity5 at her care home in @entity7 , @entity8 a bank has applied to repossess the home of an 80 - year - old @entity3 ’s sufferer after giving her a mortgage she could not hope to repay			1
just seven months before the credit crunch struck , @entity14 , then 74 , was allowed to take out a £ 470,000 interest - only five - year mortgage by the @entity16			1
experts say it would be ‘ virtually impossible ’ for mrs @entity4 to take out such a loan in today ’s more prudent lending climate			0
mrs @entity4 , a widow with 13 grandchildren , had been hoping to repay the loan by selling the house because , at the time , property prices were rising and the economy was booming			2
but the financial crisis means she is unable to pay it back by selling up as the £ 675,000 house has plunged £ 200,000 in value			2
she is now facing a court battle to keep the family home			0
in 2006 , three years before her family say her @entity3 ’s set in , mrs @entity4 , a retired property developer , agreed to pay a monthly mortgage bill of £ 493 even though she could afford it only with help from her son @entity37 , 58			1
but when this deal ended , she was put on a new repayment loan arrangement by @entity40 , which took over @entity16 , and was told she had to pay £ 4,219 a month			1
unable to make the repayments on her £ 594 - a - month pension , she fell into debt and was taken to court by the bank , which won a repossession order on the house , which her son arranged to have built for her			1
the family are challenging the court decision , but may lose the detached four - bedroom house in the exclusive area of @entity53 in @entity54 , @entity8 , near the millionaires ’ playground of @entity57			0
her son , also a property developer , said : ‘ this is appalling behaviour by a bank			0
@entity40 messed up by giving her the wrong mortgage and are now saying they want their money back			1
@entity4 was granted the mortgage by the @entity16 just three years before her @entity3 's set in ‘ so they forced a mortgage on her that she simply could not afford so that they could repossess the house and get some of their money back			1
how could any bank force a ten - year repayment mortgage on an 80 - year - old ? it ’s madness to think she could afford to pay £ 4,000 - a - month			1
’ the heartbreaking case comes just before a damning investigation by the @entity77 ( @entity77 ) is expected to reveal the full scale of the interest - only mortgage scandal , which some experts fear could be the next mis - selling debacle			1
around 40 per cent of homeowners who have a mortgage have an interest - only loan , which means they only pay the interest every month , but not a penny of the actual loan			1
in recent months , some of @entity91 ’s biggest mortgage lenders , such as the @entity92 , co-op , @entity94 , @entity95 , have all stopped selling these controversial types of mortgage			0
@entity40 now insists on a 50per cent deposit to secure an interest - only loan			1
mrs @entity4 's home is now worth less than what it was when they took out the loan			2
around 40 per cent of homeowners who have a mortgage have an interest - only loan mrs @entity4 , a frail pensioner who now lives in a care home , was originally offered the five - year interest - only mortgage for £ 470,000 by @entity16 in december 2006			1
her son claims the house he built two years earlier was worth £ 675,000 at the time , but fell to £ 450,000			1
so when the five - year term was up , mrs @entity4 , who has four grown - up children from her marriage to @entity116 who serviced power stations and died at the age of 63 in 1990 , would not have been able to sell the house without making a loss as it was worth less than the £ 475,000 mortgage			2
her son attempted to remortgage his mother ’s house to allow for a recovery in property prices			0
but @entity40 instead put her on a ten - year repayment mortgage of £ 4,219 - a - month - an increase of 750per cent on her interest - only repayments - which she would have to repay by the age of 90			1
mr @entity5 , who now lives in the house , said he blames the resulting stress for worsening his mother ’s condition			0
he said : ‘ my mother ’s illness has deteriorated since this began and i think the stress of losing her family home has not helped			0
‘ i have lost sleep and my marriage broke up as a result of this			0
if we lose this house , i ’ll be selling the @entity145			0
i feel victimised and i do n’t know when i ’m going to be homeless			0
‘ they mis - sold a mortgage to my mother and forced a loan on her which she has no hope of paying back			2
they ’re doing it up and down the country			0
’ @entity157 from the mortgage advisors @entity155 said it would be ‘ virtually impossible ’ for a woman in her 70s to take out this type of loan nowadays			0
typically , any mortgage must have been repaid by the time the homeowner reaches the age of 70 or 75 , he said			0
a spokesman for @entity40 said that following an @entity77 review of the mortgage industry , lenders can no longer offer mortgages to those of retirement age			2
he added that ‘ sale of the property ’ is no longer considered an appropriate way to repay an interest - only mortgage			1
a spokesman for @entity40 said : ‘ repossession is always the last resort for @entity40			2
we always consider every option to keep a customer in their home , including looking at alternative payments plans and terms			0
‘ in line with this policy , we have fully explored the options open to mrs @entity4 , and whilst we are of sorry that she is losing her home , mrs @entity4 has been unable to make the payments due on her loan			0

@entity14 , then 74 , was granted a £ 470,000 interest - only mortgage
she was only able to afford it with the help of her son @entity37
her @entity3 's set in just three years after she got the mortgage
@entity40 has now applied to repossess the home of the widow
