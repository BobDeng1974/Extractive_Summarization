it seems this summer 's heatwave came with an ugly side			0
waterways from @entity4 to @entity5 have turned an unsightly shade of green as a result of toxic algae blooms			1
the soaring temperatures , combined with sharp downpours washing fertiliser into ponds and lakes , has led to a larger than usual explosion of algae			2
unsightly : toxic algae blooms seen covering the surface of the @entity19 canal basin in @entity20 are being blamed on recent soaring summer temperatures marred : @entity22 is just one among many picturesque spots across the @entity24 that have been marred by the presence of the lurid green algae a total of 137 cases of algae have been reported to the @entity32 since january , compared with 127 last year , a report in the @entity28 said			1
as well as marring beauty spots , blue - green algae , or cyanobacteria , poses a risk to the health of humans and animals			1
the green slime , which has been sighted along the @entity4 coast , the @entity42 , and @entity44 's glacial meres , starves fresh water of oxygen - threatening fish living in canals or lakes			1
it can cause neurological and digestive problems if ingested by livestock , while in humans it can prompt convulsions or liver failure			0
the lake in @entity20 's @entity56 is among the bodies of water coated in green scum			0
sightings : a total of 137 cases of algae have already been reported to the @entity32 since january , compared with 127 last year the @entity32 has used special pumps to aerate several lakes during the hot summer months , boosting oxygen in the water back to levels safe for fish			1
@entity71 , a spokesman for @entity72 , told the @entity28 : ' blooms are very in - evidence this year in particular , with huge swathes of lakes covered in algae			2
' when there is too much of it in the water the fish are effectively suffocating - we â€™ve seen a number of cases of it in the last few years			0
the algae blankets out the light and takes up the oxygen , which cuts off the supply for everything living in the water			0
' according to the @entity93 ( @entity94 ) , 24 dogs have died or had to be put down as a result of algae poisoning			0
scum : the @entity32 has been aerating lakes across the country blighted by the algae , which starves fresh water of oxygen and can cause fish to suffocate			2

potentially **harmful** blue - green algae sighted everywhere from @entity4 coast to @entity42
the unsightly algae blooms can prove *deadly* to fish and **harmful** to humans and livestock
@entity32 reported a rise in algae *due* to hot *weather* *interspersed* with heavy downpours
