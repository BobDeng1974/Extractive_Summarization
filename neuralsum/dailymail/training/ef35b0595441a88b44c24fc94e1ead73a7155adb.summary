geologists have attacked @entity2 ’s claim that they are less ‘ important ’ than supermarket shelf stackers			1
the @entity4 issued the rebuke after geology graduate @entity6 won a landmark court case against the government ’s back - to - work scheme , which involved work experience at @entity11			1
he said : ‘ the next time these smart people who say there ’s something wrong with this go into their supermarket , ask themselves this simple question			0
professor @entity18 , left , said he would be surprised if @entity2 , right , though geologists were any less ' than equally vital to the economy as those who stack shelves ' ‘ when they ca n’t find the food on the shelves , who is more important : them , the geologist , or the person that stacked the shelf ? ’ now the @entity28 has voiced its ‘ surprise ’ at the minister ’s comments			1
professor @entity18 , the society ’s secretary for foreign and external affairs , responded : ‘ without geologists , there would be no way to supply supermarkets with produce , no transport for customers or staff – no shelves , in fact			2
‘ geologists are a vital part of that supply chain – mining the minerals essential for fertilisers , obtaining metal ores , discovering the fuel which transports produce to the store , and engineering our transport infrastructure			0
‘ we would be surprised if mr @entity2 considered geology graduates anything less than equally vital to the economy as those who stack shelves			2
geology student @entity6 won a landmark case against the government 's back - to - work scheme ‘ many geologists spend a lot of time in challenging conditions - on oil rigs in the @entity65 , in trenches and mines , conducting field work in all weathers			1
