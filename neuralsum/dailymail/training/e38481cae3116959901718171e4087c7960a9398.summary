published : 18:09 est , 8 june 2013 updated : 18:29 est , 8 june 2013 we got them out in the nick of time			0
as the five street dogs , smuggled by @entity6 out of a notorious state - run pound in @entity9 , were being readied for their journey to the @entity11 , the shelter shut its doors to charity workers , who feared the notorious ‘ @entity15 ’ vet , dr @entity14 , was killing the animals inside			1
fifty demonstrators descended on the compound , but no one was allowed inside			0
a picture of the body of a dead dog inside an empty sack was later published in local newspapers			0
six weeks ago , i travelled to @entity9 to highlight the terrible plight of the country ’s three million street dogs , many of which are starving , targeted by drivers , and routinely kicked , stoned and beaten			1
saviours : @entity33 , right , and k - 9 @entity35 with dogs @entity36 and @entity38 , who were rescued from @entity9 reunited : @entity33 is handed her @entity9 rescue dog @entity36 by @entity40 from pet charity @entity41 for animals alongside me were @entity43 , 42 , @entity44 , 39 , and @entity35 , 32 , the founders of @entity11 - based charity , @entity46 , set up in 2011 to help stray dogs in @entity48 and dogs bred for meat in @entity51			1
it was these three very determined women who showed me that , while life is tough for @entity9 ’s street dogs , their fate is often much worse if they are caught by the state ’s pounds			1
when we visited the shelter in @entity64 , two hours from the capital @entity59 , the filth and the overcrowding was shocking			2
and when the ‘ @entity15 ’ vet lifted an ancient , frail little grey dog up by her hind leg , i knew that i had to save her			0
near death : @entity36 had been dehydrated , starving , and suffering from hypothermia when @entity33 found her in a shelter in @entity64 we later crept out of the pound with this sorry bundle wrapped in a sweater , along with her four cage companions : @entity75 , a collie - cross puppy , @entity77 , a @entity79 cross , @entity80 , a gorgeous blonde , and @entity82 , a nondescript brown scruff			1
at a private veterinary clinic , the little grey dog , which i named @entity36 , was found to be dehydrated , starving , and suffering from hypothermia			1
@entity77 had an open wound , while @entity88 had parvovirus , which can be fatal			0
all have since been treated , inoculated , given passports and microchips – and a ticket to a new life			0
at 8.30am yesterday i , along with the other adoptive parents – all @entity6 readers moved by reading about the dogs ’ plights – were at @entity98			1
@entity80 is being taken by @entity99 and @entity100 , from @entity101 , while @entity82 was being picked up by @entity102 and @entity103 , from @entity104			0
@entity77 is being fostered until he can be taken home with @entity106 , also from @entity104			2
as they arrived , i glimpsed them in the back in their cages			0
they had changed almost beyond recognition ; @entity38 has put on loads of weight , and @entity36 seems to have grown some decidedly fluffy fur			1
holding them in my arms , remembering how close they had been to death , made all the hard work worth it			0
happy families : @entity33 and @entity36 , centre , with fellow new owners , left to right , @entity100 with @entity126 , @entity127 with @entity38 , @entity128 with @entity129 and @entity103 with @entity77 they were tired , but no longer scared or aggressive			1
their new owners were soon in tears			0
but it is not an entirely happy ending			0
on our visit to @entity9 , we also spotted six animals we christened ‘ the dogs in the dark ’			1
they had been kept in a cage , completely in darkness , for two years			0
since my initial article was published on april 28 , three have been liberated thanks to the £ 7,000 raised by generous @entity6 readers			2
but there are still three dogs left behind			2
to save them and for more information , visit k - 9angels.org			2
to the rescue : @entity33 with @entity154 , @entity43 , @entity155 and @entity156 rescuing dogs in a state dog pound in @entity64 , @entity9			1
