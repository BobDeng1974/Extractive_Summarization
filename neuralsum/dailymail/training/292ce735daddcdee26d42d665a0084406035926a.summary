a women ’s university rowing club has been banned from @entity2 after their nude charity calendar was branded as pornography			1
students from the @entity6 dressed down for the shoot , which sold 1,500 copies , and raised thousands of pounds for @entity9			1
the 17 members of the group posed naked next to the @entity12 and their boat house in @entity14 , @entity15 , before posting the pictures on both @entity2 and @entity17			1
but the girls have been left devastated after @entity2 removed their page ‘ @entity39 ’s women ’s @entity38 ’ for its ‘ explicitly sexual content ’			1
the rowers were told they were breaching the social media sites ’ ‘ nudity and pornography ’ policy			0
organiser @entity46 , 20 , has blasted @entity2 ’s decision for harming their chances of raising more money for charity with their 2015 calendar , due to be released later this year			1
the history and politics student , who has just finished her second year , said : ‘ @entity2 can unpublish pages after it gives you a warning to make amendments			2
‘ that happened to us a couple of times over the last year where they would ask us to remove certain pictures randomly because they breached their nudity and porn regulations			0
organiser @entity46 , 20 , has blasted @entity2 's decision for harming their chances of raising more money miss @entity46 believes @entity2 's decision is ' borderline sexism ' as the male group is allowed to keep its page the group has already shot its 2015 calendar , which is due to be released in october this year the rowers have sent countless emails to @entity2 in a bid to try and get their page back up and running ‘ we always made the amendments and took the pictures down - even though they were no racier than the others - but a few days ago they emailed and said the page was being completely removed			1
‘ they say it is because of nudity but we are not violating any of their terms and all the pictures we post are not indecent images or inappropriate			0
‘ it is awful for us because we had over 2,000 likes which provides us with a large platform for reaching out to our target market			0
‘ we are students so we do n’t have a marketing budget so we do use social media as the main way of marketing it			0
‘ to have this page unfairly taken away is going to affect our sales for the 2015 calendar and decrease the amount we can make for charity			2
‘ there are loads of similar nude charity calendars who have @entity2 pages plastered across the site - why are n’t they being asked to takes theirs down too			2
’ @entity111 , 22 , who also organised the calendar , said the photos are ' tasteful ' and not ' pornographic ' in an email sent to the rowers , @entity2 told them their site had been removed for ‘ violating ’ its terms of use			2
it said : ‘ continued misuse of @entity2 ’s features could result in the permanent loss of your account			2
’ the group has sent countless emails to the @entity130 site in order to try and explain their situation but have yet to receive a response			0
but @entity46 , who is originally from @entity134 , @entity135 , added : ‘ it is a charity calendar - how can it be porn ? ‘ the @entity2 account for the male rower ’s charity calendar has n’t been deleted and their page is the same as ours			1
the 17 members of the group posed naked next to the @entity12 and their boat house in @entity15 the page - ' @entity39 's women 's @entity38 ' - had over 2,000 likes before it was taken down ‘ we do n’t think they have a right to take it down			1
we ’ve tried to get in contact with @entity2 and sent emails but have got no response			2
’ @entity111 , 22 , who has just graduated from @entity156 and also organised the calendar , said : ‘ the photos we posted are all tasteful and could n’t be considered obscene or pornographic			0
the social media site is known for removing posts that users find unacceptable , here are just a few : the ' @entity39 's @entity164 has been allowed to stay despite the removal of the women 's page ‘ they cited that it is due to the nudity and explicit images - we could n’t believe it			1
‘ all of the girls are strategically covered up and our calendar has been praised for its artistic and tasteful nature			0
‘ the photos are no different from the holiday snaps of men and women that appear on everyone ’s @entity2 feeds			2
‘ it is definitely going to hamper the success of the girls ’ future charity efforts which is disappointing			0
’ the sites community standards section also states : ‘ we impose limitations on the display of nudity			0
‘ we aspire to respect people ’s right to share content of personal importance , whether those are photos of a sculpture like @entity197 or family photos of a child breastfeeding			0
’ the rowers raised £ 600 for @entity9 with their first calendar in 2013 which caused controversy when it was branded as ‘ tacky ’ for portraying women as ‘ sex objects ’			1
but undeterred they took it a step further and this year ’s calendar , which features the girls completely naked , has made a whopping £ 3,400 for charity			1
and they have already shot the 2015 version which will go on sale at the end of october this year			0
