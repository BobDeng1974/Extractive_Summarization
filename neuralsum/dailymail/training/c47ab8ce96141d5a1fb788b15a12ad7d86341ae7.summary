repeat horror : the attack took place in the same town where a young mother was burned alive accused for killing a child through sorcery ( pictured ) police in @entity28 in the @entity6 highlands , were able to safely remove the two elderly women from the crowd which was about to lynch them for being ‘ sorcerers ’			1
it is believed the murdered eight - year - old was ‘ gang raped and killed by two known suspects , ’ police commander @entity35 said , adding that the suspects were among the mob accusing the women of being witches			1

the event took place a week after a mother - of - two was tossed on to a pyre of tyres and burned alive , after being accused of killing a neighbour 's six - year - old son with sorcery			1
scene : the two women had been tied to poles and were about to be burned alive when police arrived in @entity28 still alive : sorcery and witchcraft are still practiced in remote villages in @entity6 's highlands @entity18 , 20 , ' confessed ' after she was dragged from her hut , stripped naked and tortured with hot iron rods			1
