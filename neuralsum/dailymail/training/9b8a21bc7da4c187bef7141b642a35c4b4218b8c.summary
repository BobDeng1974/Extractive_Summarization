by @entity0 published : 05:13 est , 8 april 2013 updated : 05:32 est , 8 april 2013 @entity1 , 46 , was taken to @entity2 with pneumonia a seriously ill patient was treated in an @entity6 store room surrounded by cardboard boxes because the overstretched hospital was ‘ too full ’ to give her a bed			1
@entity1 , 46 , was taken to the tiny room with no central heating and put on a makeshift camp bed after being admitted to the @entity14 department at @entity2 in north wales struggling for breath and hallucinating			1
despite being barely conscious as a result of serious pneumonia , doctors allegedly said the mother - of - four would be better off at home as there was no room for her			1
she was also told she would be unable to have the x-ray she needed because the equipment was faulty			1
she claims there were four doctors in the department , two nurses and one healthcare assistant working during the chaotic shift at @entity2 hospital @entity14 unit in north @entity33			1
mrs @entity1 , from @entity34 , who is now recovering at home , said : ‘ staff in hospitals do care about their patients but there are not enough of them to cope			1
‘ wards have been shut and there are not enough beds for patients			0
‘ staff are doing their best in impossible circumstances with poor resources , yet they are demoralised on a daily basis			2
’ last year @entity52 figures revealed that nearly 67,000 patients waited up to 12 hours on a trolley or parked in side rooms over a six - month period			0
this may simply be the tip of the iceberg , as @entity6 analysts say clever number - crunching by hospitals may be hiding the true extent of the problem			0
mrs @entity1 added : ‘ my husband found out that there were four doctors in the department , two nurses and one healthcare assistant			1
and this was a mid-week wednesday , not a weekend			0
‘ @entity45 were overrun with sheer numbers of people to treat , and there were simply not enough of them to cope			0
the doctor apologised for the room they had to use temporarily			2
‘ it was a store room with boxes in , with a makeshift treatment bed installed and no heating			1
it felt very cold but as my temperature was high , i did not care			0
‘ the doctor made routine investigations and said i needed an x-ray , as this would show up pneumonia for definite			1
' but he explained the x-ray department was “ down ” currently			2
mrs @entity1 , who is pictured with husband @entity87 , was deemed to be too ill to wait in the waiting room so was told to sit in a staff meeting room while she awaited treatment ‘ he told me : “ the hospital is full			1
there are no beds currently			0
it 's midnight and i fear that if you were to wait for a bed , you would be here all night in a chair until the day staff come on shift			1
i can give you the antibiotics needed , but to be frank , you will be better off in your own bed at home than waiting here ”			1
’ the incident occurred after mrs @entity1 suffered two weeks of cold and flu symptoms and was taken to the hospital by her husband , @entity87			1
nurses initially deemed her too ill to sit in the waiting room and instead sent her to wait in a nearby staff meeting room			1
but mrs @entity1 was then taken to the cold storeroom as staff needed the meeting room			1
mrs @entity1 , who has now started a blog called ' @entity115 ' to campaign against @entity6 cuts , said : ‘ i was gasping for breath , had a hacking repeated cough , a high temperature and the straw that broke the camel 's back - hallucinations			1
at hospital i could not hold my head up and lolled to one side in the chair			0
‘ the triage nurse assessed me and queried pneumonia			0
i was then told i would have to wait for the doctor , but the waiting room was not ideal for me so i was put in a nurses meeting room			1
mrs @entity1 , who is pictured with sons @entity133 and @entity135 , was then moved to be treated in a store room on a camp bed because the staff room was needed and there were no spare beds ‘ i was wheeled past a corridor full of sick people on trolleys , past the packed waiting room and the cubicles , which were all full , and into the nurses meeting room			1
‘ a healthcare assistant brought me some water and then scurried away			0
my husband asked a passing nurse whether there was anywhere i could lie down as i was in danger of falling out if the wheelchair as i could not hold my head up and was lolling to one side			0
‘ she said everywhere was full , but she would see how long i had to wait to see the doctor as she could see i was very ill. my husband then asked for a pillow to support me , but was told there were none available and was offered a rolled up blanket			2
’ mr @entity160 was then called away to pick up one of the couple ’s children - forcing him to leave mrs @entity1 at the hospital			1
she said : ‘ the nurse said it may take " some time " to be seen then asked me if i could wait in the foyer as they needed the room			2
‘ i replied i could not get up and walk as i was very weak			0
she said she did not have the time to wheel me into the foyer , so i would have to walk as best i could			0
mrs @entity1 needed an x-ray to confirm that she had pneumonia but was told that this was not possible as the equipment was faulty ‘ i only remember blurred visions of people passing by			1
i managed to get there and waited for my husband to return			0
a couple of teenagers asked me if i was alright as i was slumped in the chair			0
‘ my husband returned and he later said he was so shocked and angry that i was dumped in a chair by the front door , that words failed him			0
‘ when i returned home i saw a practice gp and my husband related the hospital experience and the gp agreed it was totally unacceptable			2
he said he had heard of patients being sent to another hospital some 50 miles away			0
’ @entity2 came under fire in december last year in a damning report by the @entity195 of @entity33 which said the best efforts of ‘ committed ’ @entity14 staff at the @entity199 hospital were being undermined by ‘ inadequate premises , poor communication and a lack of clinical leadership ’			1
meanwhile a report released in february found that urgent changes were needed in @entity6 staffing after more than half of dignity spot - checks in @entity33 ’ hospitals raised concerns about patient safety			2
opposition parties , patient safety groups and leading medical organisations have all said that low staffing levels on hospital wards , particularly at night , is putting patients at risk			0
a spokesman for the @entity220 said : ‘ we are very sorry that mrs @entity1 feels let down by the care provided to her			2
this is not the type of care we want to provide for our patients at all			0
‘ during the last few weeks we have faced significant pressures , along with the rest of @entity33 , due to a rise in the number of seriously ill patients being admitted to hospital			2
mrs @entity1 is now writing a blog called @entity234 to campaign against @entity6 cuts ‘ our doctors and nurses are working extremely hard to cope with increased pressure on beds as patients need to stay longer in hospital to recover than normal			2
’ the news of mrs @entity1 ’s experience at @entity2 comes just two months after it was revealed that a father died of meningitis after doctors at the hospital dismissed his symptoms as swollen joints			1
@entity250 , 46 , contracted a rare form of the disease but medics dismissed his symptoms as swollen joints and later said it was simply a virus ' doing the rounds '			0
his condition rapidly deteriorated and he died four days after he first felt ill. the same hospital also came under scrutiny in 2011 after it was revealed that a surgeon needlessly amputated a woman ’s leg			0
@entity263 , an orthopaedic consultant at the hospital carried out an above knee amputation on @entity267 ' right leg in 2006 after diagnosing osteomyeltitis , a serious and potentially life - threatening bone infection			0
mrs @entity267 , from @entity270 , @entity271 , already had a below - the - knee amputation on the same leg in 1995 , partially as a result of her spina bifida			0
but , after the operation , subsequent tests - carried out at the insistence of the mother - of - three - found no evidence of the disease and mrs @entity267 was told : ' sorry there 's been a mistake			2

@entity1 was taken to @entity2 struggling to breathe
was deemed to ill to sit in the waiting room so was taken to a staff room
she was later moved to *unheated* store room and put on a camp bed
needed an x-ray but was unable to have one as the equipment was broken
was told she would be ' better off at home , as there was no room for her '
