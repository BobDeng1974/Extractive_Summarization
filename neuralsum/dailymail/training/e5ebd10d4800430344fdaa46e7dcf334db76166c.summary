' he told @entity106 's @entity105 : ' i think @entity12 is a complete star and what i am pleased about in the @entity92 is that there is n't just one prime minister and one leader - we have got a team of leaders			1
' i have got an excellent home secretary in @entity117 , you saw the chancellor of the exchequer yesterday with the grit that he has shown in getting our deficit down and delivering our long - term economic plan			2
@entity12 is an outstanding mayor of @entity82 and i am delighted he is coming back to @entity96 and i think there are real opportunities for him in the future			2
' mr @entity0 said ; ' it 's a bit like being a football manager			0

however , mr @entity0 plans to use a script so he can ' lay out my plan for @entity50 '			0
he told the @entity52 : ' i 've been leader of my party for eight years and prime minister for four and i think people have a clear idea			1
i do n't see a contradiction : if people are worried , is this country going to deliver for me ? is there a good job for my child ? ' is there a good school place and is there going to be a clean and safe environment ? are we going to be a country that keeps our promises to the poorest in the world because @entity50 means something in the world ?
