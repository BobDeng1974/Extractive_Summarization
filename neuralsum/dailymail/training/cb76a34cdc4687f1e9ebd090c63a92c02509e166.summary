the cost of renovating the @entity1 ahead of @entity3 ’s 2016 move will rise by £ 35.9million but the extra funding will not be paid for by either the @entity3 or the taxpayer			1
the iconic venue in @entity7 is due to host five matches at next year ’s @entity9 before becoming @entity3 ’s permanent home for the 2016/17 season			2
the original stadium cost £ 429m to build and a fixed conversion fee of a further £ 154m was agreed with constructor @entity14			0
unforeseen circumstances have seen costs of renovating the @entity1 rise by £ 35.9million but @entity3 , the stadium 's future tenants , will not have to contribute towards the increased cost the problem involves extending and strengthening the roof of the stadium used for the @entity25 that figure , however , has now risen by £ 35.9m to £ 189.9m due to the complexity of extending and strengthening the roof , but neither @entity3 nor the taxpayer will be covering the added cost			1
' providing adequate support for the new roof has required significantly more strengthening work to the main roof truss , which was originally designed to be taken down after the @entity37 , ' a statement on queenelizabetholympicpark.co.uk read			0
' we have therefore today agreed to increase the value of the @entity14 contract by £ 35.9m to £ 189.9m			0
' we will meet these costs from the project contingencies and additional income we will generate from our other developments			0
' there will therefore be no additional call on the taxpayer and no impact on our current programme			0
' the taxpayer will not be forced to shell out for the additional cost , it comes from project contingencies ' additional income from other developments ' will also help to fund the increased costs of the build measuring approximately 45,000 square metres and 84m at its deepest point , the new roof will be the longest cantilevered roof in the world , with construction experts consulting similar technology to that used on @entity65 oil rigs			1
despite the total bill for the stadium now amounting to £ 618.9m , @entity3 will contribute only £ 15m for a 99 - year lease together with annual rent and a share of income as was agreed last year with the @entity72 , chaired by @entity74 mayor @entity73			2
the renovated venue will have 50,000 seats and will also serve as the national competition stadium for athletics in the @entity79 , hosting regional and international events			2
@entity3 will leave their @entity82 home to move across @entity74 into the new 50,000 - seater venue			1

@entity7 's @entity1 will cost more to renovate than first *thought*
issues with the roof of the 50,000 - seat venue have increased costs
@entity93 's @entity92 first *revealed* the rise in costs on *tuesday*
the taxpayer wo *n't* have to fit the bill either - it comes from other projects
