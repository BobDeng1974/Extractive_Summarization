guests are throwing pre-lit cigarette butts to the adult male known as @entity15 then laughing as he smokes like a human			0
it is thought he learnt how to smoke by imitating zoo visitors			1
and it comes just two years after another of the zoo 's orangutans , @entity23 , had to be moved to an island to quit her cigarette habit			1
a zoo spokesperson said : ' it is difficult to prevent the visitors from giving cigarettes to @entity7			1
smoking habits in orangutans are dangerous and can lead to a lack of appetite			1
' the photographer @entity36 who captured the images said : ' i was photographing the animals at the zoo when i got to @entity7 's cage and spotted him smoking			1
' i saw there were visitors taking pictures on their phones and laughing			2
' dr @entity46 , head of @entity47 at @entity48 , added : ' mimicry is a well - known behavioural characteristic in primates			2
it is how they learn , much as human children do			0
' in a captive environment , with little to do , intelligent primates commonly resort to mimicry to keep themselves occupied , and whilst we accept zoos as a normal part of present day society , it is nonetheless very sad to witness captive animals being presented with the opportunity to copy some of the least acceptable aspects of human behaviour			0
' hanging out : in a captive environment , with little to do , intelligent primates commonly resort to mimicry to keep themselves occupied relax : @entity7 enjoys a puff on a cigarette while he hangs out in a tree caught in the act : photographer @entity36 spotted @entity74 smoking in the zoo in central @entity13 exhale : smoke can be seen billowing from the orangutan 's mouth as he sits back on some grass inhale : @entity7 has a crafty cigarette by some water surrounded by foliage chain smoker : @entity7 is shrouded by a cloud of smoke as he smokes another cigarette break : the 14 - year - old adult male appears to really enjoy his smoke breaks unhealthy : the male orangutan 's habit is proving a big draw for tourists who visit the zoo bad habit : the 14 - year - old is now said to be smoking dozens of cigarettes a day orangutans are among the most intelligent primates ; they use a variety of sophisticated tools and construct elaborate sleeping nests each night from branches and foliage			1
but they are also the most solitary of the great apes , with social bonds occurring primarily between mothers and their dependent offspring , who stay together for the first two years			0
native to @entity13 and @entity114 , orangutans are currently found in the rainforests of @entity116 and @entity117			1
they are the two exclusively @entity119 species of extant great apes			0
orangutans spend most of their time in trees			0
their hair is typically reddish - brown , instead of the brown or black hair typical of chimpanzees and gorillas			2
and males and females differ in size and appearance - dominant adult males have distinctive cheek pads and produce long calls that attract females and intimidate rivals			2
younger males do not have these characteristics and resemble adult females			0
fruit is the most important component of an orangutan 's diet ; however , the apes will also eat vegetation , bark , honey , insects and even bird eggs			0
they can live over 30 years in both the wild and captivity .			0
