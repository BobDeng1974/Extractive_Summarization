please cover up or i will report you			0
' the note went on to say , ' you disgust me			2
i did n't move here for this			0
also , cover up when walking your cat			0
' the unidentified woman from @entity20 in @entity21 told @entity22 that the note completely shocked her , and left her feeling as though she was n't free to be herself in her own home			1
social media users have slammed the note as ' cowardly ' , ' rude ' , ' tactless ' , and ' sick '			1
' whoever wrote that note and left it on the lady 's front door is nothing but scum , why did n't she confront the lady instead of the note , because whoever did it is gutless and cruel , ' said one commenter			1
' ( i was ) shocked , horrified and angry at why someone could do this and leave a note instead of talking to me about it , ' the @entity20 woman said			1
she received support from many in her @entity20 community , with one commenter pointing out that ' the lady wearing what she likes , when she likes and where she likes , is her business , and to the low life scum bag that left the note , get a life			2
