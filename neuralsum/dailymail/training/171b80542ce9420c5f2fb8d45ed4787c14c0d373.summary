air drumming along to the radio brings limited satisfaction , but now there ’s a device that can transform any object into a drum when you hit it			1
@entity8 is designed for people who have always wanted to unleash their inner @entity10 but do n’t have space for a drum kit			2
the potentially annoying gadget can be played anywhere and uses sensitive clips that , when attached to everyday objects such as a stapler or hole punch , produce a drum or cymbal sound when the objects are struck			1
@entity34 is emitted from a three - inch ( 8cm ) speaker on the top of the battery - powered portable domed device			1
an ‘ aux in ’ jack also lets users connect external sound sources such as mp3 players so they can drum along with their favourite tunes			0
@entity8 comes with four slots ( pictured ) to plug the sensitive clips into and each generates a different drumming - related sound effect @entity46 , a @entity48 manufacturer of electronic instruments , makes the @entity8 and hopes that the device will enable more people to take up the drums			1
but because of the reasonable price point , the gadget may be used as an annoying toy			0

‘ @entity8 will breathe new life into your drum practice and is a great way to enhance your experience and creativity			0
