commons watchdogs insist the royals need more money - spinning ventures to stop their palaces crumbling after years of complacency			1
the backlog of repairs is so great it will cost at least £ 50million to restore the @entity4 ’s @entity17 residence and other historic buildings			1
forty per cent of royal properties – including parts of @entity5 and @entity21 – are below ‘ acceptable ’ standards , with some in a dangerous condition			1
members of the commons public accounts committee want royal courtiers to get a ‘ firmer grip ’ on their finances to stop taxpayers footing the whole bill			1
‘ the truth of the matter is that the palace has been living from hand to mouth for some time , ’ the committee ’s chairman , @entity31 , told the mail last night			2
‘ the trouble is that people are frightened , because this is the @entity41 , to address the issue head on			0
’ she suggested extending the opening season at @entity5 and exploring other business opportunities			1
‘ @entity4 is not there for much of the time and i find it hard to believe they ca n’t open the palace to the public for longer , ’ she added			1
the committee ’s findings follow a parliamentary grilling of the sovereign ’s most senior staff last autumn over whether the monarchy offered value for money to taxpayers			2
senior royal aides maintain the repairs backlog has built up because of a real - terms squeeze of up to 60 per cent in their funding by governments over the past 20 years			2
this , they say , has forced them to patch up the palaces instead of embark on whole - scale repairs			2
but the @entity7 claimed yesterday that the @entity4 ‘ has not been served well by the @entity70 and by the @entity71 ... in balancing the books and preserving heritage buildings ’			2
according to mps the @entity70 has fallen short by spending more than it took in			0
net expenditure of £ 33.3million in 2012 - 2013 was 7 per cent higher than its income of £ @entity79 resulted in the palace taking out £ 2.3million from its reserves – leaving the @entity4 with just £ 1million in the bank			1
that was described by mps as an ‘ historically low level of contingency ’			0

’ it was even more critical of what it described as the @entity70 ’s failure to look after ‘ nationally important heritage properties adequately ’			0
the @entity110 encompasses about 360 buildings including @entity21 , @entity112 , @entity113 and parts of @entity115			0
the accounts committee is now demanding that staff ‘ get a much firmer grip ’ on how they plan to address the repairs backlog			1
mps also urged the @entity4 and her staff to drum up ways of generating more income and achieving savings			2
@entity5 has been open to the paying public for around two months each summer since 1993 and small number of state apartments , particularly in @entity113 ’s and @entity115 palaces , are occasionally rented out for carefully - selected commercial ventures			1
it emerged that @entity133 investment bank @entity131 hired @entity5 out for a private dinner attended by the @entity135 , @entity136 and former @entity138 chief @entity137			2
last year these ventures raised £ 11.6million			2
but @entity7 also highlighted the fact that staffing levels have remained at around 430 for the past seven years , with no apparent cuts			0

the grant is taken from the @entity110 , an £ 8billion portfolio of agricultural land , buildings and property			0
the monarch is now , for the first time in two centuries , entitled to keep 15 per cent of the profits with the rest going to the @entity71			0
a @entity5 spokesman said last night : ‘ the move to the sovereign grant has created a more transparent and scrutinised system , which enables the @entity70 to allocate funding according to priorities			0
venue : a state banquet at @entity21 ( left ) , and the interior of @entity5			0
it has emerged that @entity133 investment bank @entity131 hired @entity5 out for a private dinner attended by the @entity135 , @entity136 and former @entity138 chief @entity137 ' this has resulted in a more efficient use of public funds			1
the @entity70 was charged by the public accounts committee in 2009 to generate more income to supplement the funding it receives from government			1
this has been done successfully			0
‘ in 2012 - 13 the @entity70 generated £ 11.6million in comparison with £ 6.7 million in 2007 - 8			0
work on income generation continues			0
