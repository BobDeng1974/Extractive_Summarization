the discovery of a fall in levels of a certain type of genetic material could signal an increased risk of developing @entity18 ’s			1
the biological marker is found in cerebral spinal fluid ( @entity21 ) at least 10 years before signs of dementia become apparent			1
there are 800,000 people with dementia in the @entity27 , and one in three people over 65 will die from the degenerative disease			2
currently , the only way to accurately diagnose the disease is by post-mortem neuropathological analysis , although memory and other brain function tests are used to determine whether drugs and other treatment may help			0
@entity38 researchers at the @entity39 of @entity40 of @entity41 believe they may have found a marker that could suggest the disease process is underway before symptoms start to show			2
they found a drop in the content of mitochondrial dna ( @entity48 ) - genetic material present in the energy centre of cells - in spinal fluid may be a signal for the disease			1
they suggest that decreased @entity48 levels reflect the diminishing ability of mitochondria to power brain cells , thus triggering their death			0
the drop in the concentration of @entity48 precedes the appearance of other recognised biochemical @entity18 ’s biomarkers , suggesting the process of @entity18 ’s disease starts earlier than previously thought and that @entity48 depletion may be one of the earliest predictors			2
researchers have previously been unable to detect the genetic material in spinal fluid , but they used a new technique to amplify tiny amounts , says a study in the journal @entity77			1
the researchers hope other labs and hospitals will be able to replicate the results			0
they say by finding a way to block the degeneration , clinicians may be able to diagnose and treat the disease before symptoms even appear			0
lead author dr @entity86 said : ‘ if our initial findings can be replicated by other laboratories , the results will change the way we currently think about the causes of @entity18 ’s			0
the discovery of a fall in levels of a certain type of genetic material could signal an increased risk of developing @entity18 's			1
image shows a ct scan of the brain of someone with @entity18 's ‘ this discovery may enable us to search for more effective treatments that can be administered during the pre-clinical stage			0
’ dr @entity105 of @entity106 , the @entity27 ’s leading dementia research charity , said : ‘ problems with mitochondria have already been linked to @entity18 ’s , which is why @entity106 is currently funding research to further examine this link			0
‘ this small study suggests that decreased mitochondrial dna in cerebrospinal fluid may indicate the earliest stages of @entity18 ’s , but more work is needed to confirm this in larger groups of people			1
‘ it would be useful to see further studies investigate changes in mitochondrial dna over time , to determine how long before symptoms such changes might be detected			1
‘ we know @entity18 ’s begins to develop before symptoms appear , and the ability to detect the disease at this stage is crucial for recruiting the right people for clinical trials of potential new treatments			0
