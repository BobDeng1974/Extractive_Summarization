the biggest collection of ancient human fossils ever recovered from one site is causing scientists to reconsider the path of human evolution			1
they reveal how @entity6 , our sister species , developed their distinctive teeth before their brains , using them as a third hand for holding objects			1
the new study adds to theories that the @entity6 evolved their characteristic looks slowly , and intermittently , over hundreds of thousands of years			1
this suggests the earliest @entity6 used their jaws in a particular way for chewing as well as for holding objects			0
the discovery at the @entity38 site in @entity39 's @entity38 has allowed scientists to better understand pre-human evolution during the @entity42 period - a time in which the path of hominin evolution has been controversial and fiercely debated			1
@entity46 , a paleontologist at the @entity47 , claims the findings were consistent with a ' @entity50 ' evolutionary saga			1

a scene from the tv series is shown here in this scenario communities of humans , equivalent to ' houses ' in the sci - fi series , would compete for habitable areas more than 400,000 years ago			1
neanderthals and modern humans are thought to have co-existed for thousands of years and interbred			0
these ' legacy ' genes have been linked to an increased risk from cancer and diabetes by new studies looking at our evolutionary history			0
however , it is not all bad news , as other genes we inherited from our species ' early life could have improved our immunity to diseases which were common at the time , helping humans to survive			0
speaking to @entity88 , professor @entity84 , research leader in human origins at the @entity86 in @entity87 , said : ' we got a quick fix to our own immune system by breeding with @entity6 which helped us to survive			2
' studies have also already been published which show that humans outside of @entity93 are more vulnerable to type 2 diabetes , and that is because we bred with @entity6 , while those who stayed inside @entity93 did n't			0
' last year researchers from @entity99 and @entity100 universities announced that genes thought to be risk factors in cancer had been discovered in the neanderthal genome , and in january nature magazine published a paper from @entity107 suggesting that a gene which can cause diabetes in @entity110 came from @entity6			0
study lead author @entity46 , said : ‘ @entity111 was a long period , of about half a million years , during which hominin evolution did n’t proceed through a slow process of change with just one kind of hominin quietly evolving towards the classic @entity6			1
’ co-author of the study published in @entity120 , @entity121 , professor of paleontology at the @entity123 , added : ‘ with the skulls we found it was possible to characterise the cranial morphology of a human population of the @entity129 for the first time			1
’ around 400,000 to 500,000 years ago , archaic humans split off from other groups of that period living in @entity93 and @entity133 , ultimately settling in @entity134			1
once settled , they evolved characteristics that would come to define the @entity6 lineage			2
several hundred thousand years later , modern humans - who had evolved in @entity93 - settled in @entity134			0
they interbred with the @entity6 , but showed signs of reproductive incompatibility			2
because of this , modern humans eventually replaced @entity6			0
the degree of divergence between @entity6 and modern humans over such a short period of time has long puzzled scientists			0
it has , until now , been difficult to fill in the gaps because the @entity150 fossil record is isolated and dispersed			0
however , samples at the @entity38 site are different			0
professor @entity46 said : ‘ what makes the @entity38 site unique is the extraordinary and unprecedented accumulation of hominin fossils there ; nothing quite so big has ever been discovered for any extinct hominin species - including @entity6			1
’ professor @entity121 added : ‘ this site has been excavated continuously since 1984			0
pictured is the discovery of one of the skulls in @entity39 's ' @entity165 '			0
@entity121 , professor of @entity167 at the @entity123 , said : ' with the skulls we found it was possible to characterise the cranial morphology of a human population of the @entity129 for the first time ' the ancient skulls ( a specimen pictured ) show a mix of @entity6 and more primitive traits , suggesting @entity6 evolved their defining characteristics in stages			1
this so - called ' mosaic pattern ' of development supports a theory of @entity6 evolution that suggests they developed their features separately the @entity38 , where the skulls were unearthed , is in the @entity39 province of @entity188 and near @entity38 and @entity189 ‘ after 30 years , we have recovered nearly 7,000 human fossils corresponding to all skeletal regions of at least 28 individuals			1
' this extraordinary collection includes 17 fragmentary skulls , many of which are very complete			2
’ the 17 skulls belong to a single population of a fossil hominin species			1
some of have been studied before , but seven are presented anew here , and six are more complete than ever before			0
with these intact samples at their fingertips , the researchers made progress characterising defining features			0
the researchers ’ skull samples showed @entity6 features present in the face and teeth , but not elsewhere			1
crucially , many of the @entity6 - derived features the researchers observed were related to chewing , and possibly holding objects with their teeth as a ' third hand			2
' professor @entity46 said : ‘ it seems these modifications had to do with an intensive use of the frontal teeth			2
‘ the incisors show a great wear as if they had been used as a third hand , ’ typical of @entity6			2
’ he added : ‘ finding a single tooth is a great success in any other site of comparable age , so imagine what it is like to painstakingly reconstruct 17 skulls - it ’s like finding a treasure			1
’ around 400 to 500 thousand years ago , archaic humans split off from other groups of that period living in @entity93 and @entity133 , ultimately settling in @entity134			2
once settled , they evolved characteristics that would come to define the @entity6 lineage			0
pictured is what a @entity6 may have looked like a reconstruction of one of the skulls is shown here			0
the extraordinary collection includes 17 fragmentary skulls , many of which are almost complete pictured is australopithecus afarensis - an extinct hominid that lived between 3.9 and 2.9 million years ago			1
the @entity42 was a long period , of about half a million years , during which hominin evolution took place in different stages rather than being a gradual process			0

the 17 skulls belong to a single population of a fossil hominin species
this is the biggest collection of human fossils ever found on one site
they shed light on pre-human evolution from around 400,000 years ago
skulls showed @entity6 features in face and teeth but not elsewhere
these features evolved *due* to eating and perhaps for use as a ' third hand '
study adds to theories that the @entity6 developed their characteristic looks slowly , and intermittently , over hundreds of thousands of years
@entity46 , a paleontologist , claims the findings were consistent with a ' @entity50 ' evolutionary saga
