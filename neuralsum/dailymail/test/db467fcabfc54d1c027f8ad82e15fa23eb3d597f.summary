an @entity2 woman was shocked this month when an officer cited her for leaving her dog in a hot car but , instead of writing a ticket , the cop forced her to sit inside to see how it feels			1
the @entity9 pet owner was inside a @entity10 as the dog sat in the parking lot			1
the officer then had the woman sit inside with the windows up and ignition off			2
and this is n't the first time an animal - loving officer has employed the unorthodox punishment			2
in the recent @entity2 incident , the woman was left ' looking uncomfortable ' as she sat in her unventilated @entity22 , but drove away with just a warning and her tail between her legs			1
@entity39 filed a report against an officer who told her to sit in her car after someone called to report a dog was inside with no ventilation in 90 degree heat			1
@entity47 reasoned that she 'd only been away ten minutes			0
' you can wait in the truck and close the door you know , since it 's not that hot , ' the officer is heard saying to @entity47 in body camera footage later obtained by @entity55			0
however , in her report , @entity47 characterizes the officers words as an ' order ' and the footage does not show her actually sitting in the hot car as police wrote her a ticket			2
sweating it out : last year , @entity39 in @entity36 , @entity37 was told to sit in her hot car after her dog was found locked inside with no ventilation			1
she filed a report against the officers , but body cam footage later revealed it was more of a request than an order declined to do it : @entity47 declined to sit in the the hot car with the door closed in spite of the officer 's request while this may not be a legitimate police practice , officers have reason for concern in these situations , according to the @entity84			1
while @entity47 argued she 'd only been gone 10 minutes , the @entity84 says that temperatures can rise @entity87 inside a car in that short amount of time			0
in 20 minutes , the temperature can rise by nearly 30 degrees			0
even on a @entity94 day , writes the @entity84 , the interior of a car can reach @entity95 after one hour			0
even short periods in such heat can cause heat stroke and irreversible organ damage in your dog			0
