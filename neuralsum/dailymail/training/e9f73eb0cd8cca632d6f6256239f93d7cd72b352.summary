@entity5 and @entity6 ‘ had sex without touching each other or taking their clothes off ’ because he was so fanatical about hygiene , says author @entity0			1
speaking at the @entity8 , the novelist claimed he believes the @entity10 dictator kept @entity6 at arm ’s length and would achieve orgasm just by watching her lift her skirt			1
he also claimed that @entity5 was an asexual and may have had a similar kind of sexual relationship with his half niece , @entity17			1
he said : ‘ i imagine @entity6 would stand a good distance away and lift her skirt and then there would be some sort of soggy climax on @entity5 ’s part and that would be that			1
’ the award - winning writer was speaking about his second @entity24 - era novel , ‘ @entity39 ’ which is being released 23 years after his first , ‘ @entity38 ’ , was published			2
and although he feels he has come to know @entity5 well , he maintains the truth about his sexuality remains a ‘ black hole ’			1
author @entity0 made the claims while speaking at the @entity8 yesterday ‘ sexuality is one of the ways we recognise each other , ’ he said ‘ knowing whether someone is married or gay or whatever it might be , you recognise that			1
‘ i do n’t want to be reductive , simplistic or frivolous but i am convinced one of the reasons why @entity5 is an unrecognisable figure is that sexually he is a void			2
‘ with @entity57 or @entity58 there is clear pattern seigniorial behaviour - of having a big appetite – but with @entity5 there is absolutely nothing			2
’ his explanation is that @entity5 was ‘ not quite the full quid ’ and may simply have been insane			1
‘ in @entity5 studies there are three schools of thought about @entity5 ’s sexuality			2
‘ one is normality but i think you can boot out that consideration immediately			0
can you see @entity6 relishing a post coital cigarette ? can you consider @entity5 ’s tender foreplay , a considerate and energetic lover ? no you ca n’t begin to imagine that			2
‘ so i ’d say normality is out			0
@entity80 is the other one - and the third one is perversion			0
‘ historians and psycho - historians who adduce perversion all come up with the filthiest stuff you could possible imagine - coprophilia , coprophagia , all things to do with excretion			0
” ‘ but there are no real clues about his sexuality - except that he would n’t take his clothes off , even for his physician and he was almost fanatical about cleanliness , which suggests to me asexuality plus			0
’ in his latest book he explores the horrors faced by thousands of @entity102 when they were sent to concentration camp @entity103			0
the author said one thing which had shocked him during research for the book is that the @entity109 had their wives and children living with them in the death camps			2
@entity0 claims that @entity5 kept @entity6 at arm ’s length and would achieve orgasm just by watching her lift her skirt @entity5 asleep in an armchair next to @entity6 in the teahouse on the @entity119 in @entity120 @entity5 kisses the hand of @entity6 , in 1941			1
author @entity0 claims @entity5 was an ' asexual ' and insane he also discovered how @entity102 had to pay for their own train fares to the camps - one - way tickets and with children under - 12 going free			1
@entity0 was speaking about his second @entity24 - era book ' @entity127 ' at festival yesterday but even though he was gaining in knowledge , @entity0 said he had still not discovered the reason for @entity5 ’s policies , particularly the hatred of the @entity102			1
‘ one ca n’t understand the @entity24 hatred because it ’s anti-human , it ’s counter-human			0
‘ it is a hatred that is not in us , it is outside man			0
’ @entity0 dubbed @entity5 ‘ a bourgeois anti-christ ’ and also spoke of his concern for the high percentages of people in many countries who remain anti-semitic to this day			1
a survey of @entity147 showed 69 per cent were anti-jew , possibly proving that a country in economic crisis was more likely to feel hostility towards @entity102 , who are seen to be clever , successful and better off			0
he also said 93 per cent of @entity153 and @entity152 people are anti-semitic while @entity154 is the most benevolent country in the @entity155 with ‘ only ’ 56 percent disliking @entity102			0
in @entity157 the figure is eight percent and in @entity158 just four percent , he added			0
@entity0 believes that for some reason @entity102 inspire either love or hatred in people - his own first love was a @entity102 girl - and that few remain neutral on the issue			1
he is planning on writing a third novel set against the same grim backdrop			0
@entity5 was rumoured to have had sexual relations with his niece @entity170 who later killed herself historian 's have spent years debating the sexual preferences of the @entity24 dictator - with some claiming he may have been homosexual			1
despite sending around 100,000 gay men to concentration camps , scholar @entity175 claims @entity5 was gay or bisexual and his party 's opposition to homosexuality was likely to be a defence mechanism oh his ' internalised homophobia '			1
but most historians reject this idea and say he was heterosexual with a number of female lovers			0
there were also speculation that he had sexual relations with his young half - niece @entity190 , who worked for him in his @entity192 apartment			1
nineteen years his junior , she would attend meetings , restaurants and visit the theatre with the man she called ' @entity200 '			0
one of @entity5 's opponents of the @entity24 , @entity202 , claimed he forced her to urinate and defecate on him			1
following an argument between the pair on september 18 , 1931 , @entity205 was found dead in her room with a gunshot wound to her lung			0
police ruled out foul play and put it down to suicide - although an inquest was never carried out			0
after her death , @entity5 was said to be devastated and went into an ' intense depression '			2
of his supposed six female lovers , two committed suicide , one died from injuries eight years after attempting suicide and another made a failed suicide attempt			2
