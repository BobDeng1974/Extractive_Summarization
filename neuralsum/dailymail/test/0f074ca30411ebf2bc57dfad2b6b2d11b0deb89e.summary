they played in grey and duly put in a dull and uninspired performance , these really are dark days for @entity4			1
still , at least they returned a club record profit of £ 18.7million last week and retail gain was probably behind the bizarre decision to ditch their black - and - white stripes			1
but on sunday they set another record as losers of the last five @entity15 derbies			1
@entity16 looks on as his @entity4 struggle against rivals @entity18 in the @entity19 head coach @entity16 said before the game he had a secret motivational tactic up his sleeve and would only reveal what it was following victory			1
well , we 'll never know what he used in a forlorn attempt to rouse his players			2
but we do know it did n't work			2
@entity31 was scathing in his assessment of @entity4 a fortnight ago when he said that their application during the 3 - 0 defeat at @entity36 was reminiscent of a set of players with one eye on their summer holidays			1
@entity31 was at the @entity42 on sunday and , rather than prove him wrong as a livid @entity16 promised his men would , they played like a side with their flip - flops on			1
@entity16 was in a rage again on sunday night , but this time it was his players feeling the fury			2
' i said before the game that no side of mine would be criticised for not working hard enough			2
i was wrong , ' he said			2
@entity52 and @entity53 do battle on the @entity42 pitch as @entity18 snatch victory ' the performance hurts more than the result			2
it 's a funny thing pressure , some players can handle it and some ca n't			0
some of ours perhaps ca n't after losing five in a row			0
' i am absolutely embarrassed to be part of it			0
' @entity4 's problem is a sad attitude of acceptance that has been allowed to permeate a squad lacking in ability and character			1
the @entity75 mandate is survival and , to that end , their season finished the minute they were more or less assured of as much			0
not even a derby can rally this lot			0
there was one incident in the second half which captured their passive approach			0
with the play dead , @entity86 had to scream at team - mate @entity88 in a desperate effort to return the ball with some sense of urgency			0
@entity18 , in contrast , hassled , harried and hounded their opponents			0
they had won the previous four derbies because they out - worked @entity4 and wanted it more			1
they won a fifth for exactly the same reasons			0
@entity99 earns @entity18 all three points with a sensational volley at the @entity42 this was billed as ' the @entity103 ' given the alarming form of the @entity106 rivals going into the game – four goals between them in 18 hours with six points taken from a possible 36			0
but there was only one team desperate to win this			0
it was n't until the final 15 minutes that @entity4 drew a save from @entity115			1
but it was too little , too late			0
far too little , in fact			0
these are dispiriting times on @entity119			0
the disconnect between supporters , players and hierarchy has never been greater			0
on full - time , the @entity4 spat as much venom towards their own team as they did the red - and - whites goading them nearby			1
they had just witnessed a dour display of nothingness , sadly lacking in energy , imagination and pride			1
@entity4 goalkeeper @entity132 can only look on in horror as the striker 's effort cruises in there was one shining light amid the darkness			1
cancer survivor @entity139 was starting his first game in 20 months and was by some distance the only player in grey worthy of applause , and that he rightly received			1
his shirt was soaked near - enough black come the end such was his effort			1
it failed , however , to inspire his team - mates , one of which , @entity132 , was criticised by fans on social media when it appeared he congratulated @entity99 for his stunning match - winner shortly before half - time			0
but to demonise @entity132 alone would be wrong			0
the problems at @entity4 run from top to bottom			1
they are a club without ambition , happy to renew their @entity162 pay packet come the end of the season			2
that message from above means you end up with performances such as this – grey , with little sign of light			2
january signing @entity99 reels away in celebration after scoring a priceless goal for @entity18 @entity18 boss @entity174 ( left ) celebrates @entity99 's opening goal as @entity4 manager the @entity18 player closed down quickly throughout as @entity4 players struggled to get going cancer survivor @entity139 ( left ) was by some distance the only player in grey worthy of applause			1

@entity4 set another record as losers of the last five @entity15 derbies
they played in grey and put in an equally dismal and uninspired display
defeat came after @entity4 *announced* club record profit of £ 18.7million
they were left to *rue* decision to ditch their black and white stripes
