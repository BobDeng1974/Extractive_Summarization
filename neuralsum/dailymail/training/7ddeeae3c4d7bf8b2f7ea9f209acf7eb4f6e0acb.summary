sixty per cent of the public believe immigration has damaged @entity2 , a major poll revealed last night			1
the study , commissioned by former @entity6 treasurer @entity5 , reveals widespread concern about the scale of immigration and its impact on jobs and public services			1
just one person in six ( 17 per cent ) believes that the advantages of immigration have outweighed the disadvantages			1
ineffective : a government initiative to reduce immigration that was deemed unlikely to work many of the 20,000 people polled also reported direct experience of losing out to immigrants in the competition for a job or public services such as housing			1
overall , it was identified as the second most important issue facing @entity2 after the state of the economy			0
lord @entity5 said the study revealed deep concerns about immigration , coupled with scepticism that any of the political parties would deal with the problem			1
‘ many feel that over the past 15 years immigration has been allowed to happen on a scale we can not cope with , and without public consent being sought or given , ’ he said			1
‘ politicians underestimated the size of the challenge , lost control of the situation , refused for too long to acknowledge that any problems might result , and are now struggling but failing to cope			0
‘ most [ of the public ] do not feel there is any strategy for dealing with the number of migrants and their successful integration into @entity2 society , or for managing the effects on housing , infrastructure , jobs , the @entity60 , schools or the benefits system			0
’ more than three - quarters of people ( 77 per cent ) said they supported a ‘ drastic ’ reduction in immigration , saying it would make it easier for @entity2 people to find jobs and reduce the pressure on public services			1
the controversial vans have been passing through @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 and @entity79			0
pictured - one of the billboards in @entity81 , @entity82 more than one - third ( 36 per cent ) said that they or a family member had found it harder to get work because of competition from immigrants , and almost a quarter ( 24 per cent ) said they or a family member had lost out to immigrants in the queue for council housing or other public services			0
women were more hostile to immigration , with just 14 per cent saying immigration had been a good thing , compared to 21 per cent of men			1
and there were clear differences between supporters of the political parties			0
some 62 per cent of @entity6 voters thought immigration had damaged @entity2 , compared to 48 per cent of @entity107 voters and 39 per cent of @entity108			1
ninety - one per cent of @entity110 voters said immigration was damaging @entity2			1
the poll also identified differences in class attitudes towards immigration			2
@entity116 has pledged to cut net migration ¿ the difference between numbers entering and leaving @entity2 middle - aged working - class voters were far more concerned about the issue , with 90 per cent saying it was one of the biggest challenges facing the country			0
by contrast , graduates working in the public sector were likely to be far more positive about immigration , with 80 per cent saying it had benefited @entity2			2
but the poll also revealed some more nuanced attitudes towards immigration			2
some 83 per cent said they or a family member had been treated by @entity60 staff from overseas , and 49 per cent said immigrants were willing to do jobs that @entity2 workers do not want to do , with 38 per cent saying they also worked harder than their @entity2 counterparts			0
the poll also revealed deep public scepticism about the willingness of the government to deal with the problems produced by immigration			2
a controversial @entity146 poster campaign warning illegal immigrants to ‘ go home or face arrest ’ was supported by 79 per cent of people , but only 17 per cent think it will work while just 37 per cent of people think illegal immigrants already in the country are ever likely to face deportation			0
@entity116 has pledged to cut net migration – the difference between numbers entering and leaving @entity2 – to under 100,000 from @entity160 countries by the time of the next general election in 2015			0
but , alarmingly for the prime minister , the study shows most people are not aware of government initiatives to bring about this reduction			2
the poll found that 76 per cent of people supported an annual cap on @entity160 immigration but only 34 per cent knew it had taken place			2
there was also widespread support for other initiatives , such as cracking down on bogus colleges that grant places to immigrants pretending to be students , toughening requirements for immigrants to speak @entity183 and making it harder for people to bring in spouses from outside @entity187 , but in each case a majority of people was unaware that action had already been taken .			0
