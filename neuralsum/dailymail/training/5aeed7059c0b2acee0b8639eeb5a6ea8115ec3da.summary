@entity1 president @entity0 has faced growing questions about his involvement in tax policy when prime minister of @entity6 senior conservatives have called for @entity9 president @entity0 to be investigated over claims he encouraged tax avoidance			1
cabinet ministers said mr @entity0 , who denies wrongdoing , should be scrutinised over allegations that he encouraged companies to avoid tax while he was finance minister and prime minister of @entity6			1
and the @entity18 warned that if more evidence emerged against mr @entity0 ' serious questions ' will be asked about him continuing in his powerful @entity22 role			2
mr @entity0 has admitted that as prime minister he was ' politically responsible ' for what happened in each and every corner of the country ' , but suggested he did not know the tax deals were being negotiated			1
companies such as @entity31 and @entity32 had their divisions in @entity6 lend money to their operations in other countries			0
the interest payments made on these loans reduced the profits in these countries			0
in some cases it was claimed companies enjoyed tax rates of less than 1 per cent on profits moved into the @entity43			0
some @entity45 backbenchers have already called for mr @entity0 to resign			0
but in a major escalation of pressure on the burecrat , work and pensions secretary @entity49 and @entity45 chairman @entity50 have backed the need for an investigation into the issue			1
mr @entity49 said he did not know if the matters were true or false but said the @entity9 needed to show it had ' no fear of investigating their own '			1
he did not name or criticise mr @entity0 directly when asked about the issue on @entity59 's @entity58			0
but he said : ' this is a real moment for the @entity61 , for the commission , to show that it has the capacity and the determination to investigate its own and so if there is an issue , if there is some serious issue about a conflict and at one time one thing is being said and at another thing is being done , then these things need to be investigated and made public			1
' and as soon as they 're made public decisions have to be taken			0
' the trouble for the @entity61 historically has been that it circles the wagons around the people that are having the finger pointed at them and refuses to let any kind of change takes place			0
' questioned if he expected mr @entity0 to be thoroughly investigated by the commission , mr @entity49 replied : ' i think what is required from the @entity9 is complete transparency			1
' when pressed if this meant mr @entity0 's case , the cabinet minister replied : ' yes			2
i would say the same by the way if it were @entity93			0
' you need to make sure when you 're saying one thing and doing one thing that you do n't then say and do another at the same time , so there has to be an absolute clear purpose and at the same time a determination of the @entity9 to make sure this whole issue is not brushed under the carpet but is transparent , open and investigated and then decisions can be taken one way or another			2
' mr @entity0 , pictured ( front right ) with world leaders at the @entity108 summit in @entity109 at the weekend , has denied any wrongdoing work and pensions secretary @entity49 and @entity45 party chairman grants @entity112 have said it is right for mr @entity0 to be investigated mr @entity50 , the @entity45 chairman , said it was important that those in senior roles in @entity117 are held to account			1
he told the same programme : ' i have n't seen all this evidence			0
' i think it is absolutely right that it is properly investigated and that is what i hope will happen next			0
' but either way the important thing is to hold @entity117 to account and to do that you 've got to have a credible in - out referendum so you can have these negotiations about all of this stuff			0
' last week it emerged that speeches mr @entity0 made while prime minister of @entity6 including an announcement to parliament that @entity137 and @entity138 were planning to move their @entity117 headquarters to the country thanks to favourable corporate tax conditions his government had created			1
@entity18 's shadow @entity117 minister @entity143 also warned mr @entity0 's role could be put into doubt			2
asked if mr @entity0 should resign or stand aside while the claims are examined , shadow @entity117 minister @entity143 told @entity59 : ' i think there 's little chance of that but i think if more comes out on this then really serious questions will have to be asked about his position			1
' despite being @entity6 's prime minister for 18 years - 15 of which were also spent as finance minister - mr @entity0 last week denied being involved in shaping the tax rulings that critics say enable corporations to slash their tax bills by shifting their @entity117 operations to the country			1
' there is nothing in my past indicating that my ambition was to organise tax evasion in @entity117 , ' he said during a press conference , adding that he was ' not the architect of what you could call the @entity6 problem '			2
instead he said it was up to the current @entity6 government to explain the situation			0

@entity49 and @entity50 pile pressure on @entity9 chief
senior @entity178 insist the @entity61 must be prepared to ' investigate its own '
@entity6 did tax break deals with more than *300* global firms
the claims are now being investigated by the @entity9
they were signed while @entity0 was prime minister of @entity6
