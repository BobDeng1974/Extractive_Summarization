by @entity1 reporter a seal called keith which anglers wanted to shoot in order to protect fish stocks has had a last minute reprieve			1
the 4ft seal , which is in fact female , became a local celebrity after she swam over 50 miles inland up the @entity10 , in @entity11			2
but after a storm of protest and an internet campaign , the @entity12 has agreed to support attempts to return @entity17 to her feeding grounds in the @entity20			1
all at sea : @entity17 the female seal is said to be confused after losing her way and swimming up the @entity10 animal - lovers have followed its journey and reports of sightings after it was first spotted in the @entity10 in november			1
but after she was snapped eating a duck and numerous fish , the @entity12 labelled it a ‘ marine predator ’ and threatened to obtain a licence and use a qualified marksman to shoot the mammal			1
@entity37 , chief executive of the @entity12 , said : ‘ this marine predator can not be allowed to carry on eating its way through freshwater fish that have taken decades to grow to a size			2
' we will try everything possible to remove it humanely but more drastic action may be the only option if these methods do not work			0
’ ' @entity49 predator ' : @entity17 the seal tucks into a freshly - caught salmon , much to the dismay of local anglers this picture and the one above were taken by cyclist @entity55 who spotted @entity17 near @entity56 in @entity57 enjoying herself : @entity17 seems in no hurry to leave one angling club member even claimed @entity17 was a threat to pets			1
@entity63 said : ‘ i am very worried as it has started taking ducks and waterfowl and soon will start attacking swans and maybe dogs swimming			0
’ but within hours of the shooting threat emerging a @entity71 campaign entitled ‘ @entity72 ’ was launched			0
it was endorsed with more than 600 ‘ likes ’			0
@entity74 was also buzzing with messages backing @entity17 , while an online petition to save the seal from the bullet amassed well over 400 signatures			1
the seal was first photographed having swum upstream to @entity81 and @entity82 in @entity11			2
there locals nicknamed it after @entity17 , the @entity86 commander at the @entity87 during the @entity88			2
the seal ’s usual home is believed to be in the @entity20 or @entity91 an @entity93 spokesman said : ‘ we understand the concerns of anglers , but one animal in a large river like the @entity10 is unlikely to have a significant impact on fish stocks			1
‘ this is natural predation and it will eventually make its way back out to sea			0
‘ with this is mind , and because seals are a protected species , we wo n’t be taking action			0
’ an @entity110 spokesman said : ‘ it ’s not uncommon for seals to venture away from the sea			0
‘ as long as the seal is not injured , or in any immediate danger , then we would not be concerned for its welfare			0
’ @entity17 's petition can be found at www.facebook.com/savetheseal , and the petition at @entity120 where am i ? @entity17 found herself in @entity124 in @entity11 , 100 miles from the sea anglers ' delight : @entity17 's presence in the @entity10 near @entity57 has upset local fishermen because of her predilection for their fish			1
