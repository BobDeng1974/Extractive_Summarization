by @entity0 published : 09:48 est , 1 august 2012 updated : 01:56 est , 2 august 2012 a church which was handed £ 67,000 in a will is facing bankruptcy after it emerged the cash was intended for a different church of the same name			1
parishioners at @entity8 in @entity9 , @entity10 , thought their prayers were answered when they were apparently bequeathed the cash from a generous well - wisher			1
clergymen spent £ 6,000 repairing the roof and invested the rest in a year - long investment bond			1
error : parishioners at @entity8 in @entity9 , @entity10 , ( pictured ) have been wrongly bequeathed £ 67,000 from a well - wisher and they spent £ 6,000 repairing the church roof - but the money is n't theirs mistake : all the money was supposed to go to the @entity8 in @entity22 , ( pictured ) which is just 1.4 miles down the road from the other church but £ 61,000 has been invested in a year long bond but it has now emerged that the money was actually meant for @entity8 in @entity22 , which is just 1.4 miles down the road			1
now lawyers have requested the money back which could send the church in @entity9 into bankruptcy			1
parochial church council member @entity31 said : ' the bottom line is that the church might go bankrupt because the money given each month does n’t match the outgoings			2
' @entity35 may be a bit extreme but without the money we will be in great difficulty			0
' worshippers at the @entity9 were stunned when the anonymous benefactor bequeathed the money in september last year			2
but only 10 months later treasurer @entity41 received a letter from @entity43 , based in @entity22 , stating that they had made an error when administering the will			0
aerial view to show the proximity of @entity8 , @entity9 ( top circled ) and the @entity8 in @entity22 ( below )			1
both churches are now working together to resolve the situation church leaders say they can cover the £ 6,000 already spent from other savings but the remaining £ 61,000 is tied up in a savings plan until february 2013			1
mr @entity31 added : ' we sought legal advice about whether we could claim against the solicitor for the £ 6,000 we have spent , but the @entity57 advised us that we must give the money back and that , as it was an honest mistake , we should go no further			1
worried : parochial church council member @entity31 said that the bottom line is that the church in @entity9 might go bankrupt ' all very @entity62 but it still puts us heavily out of pocket			1
not only do we stand to lose £ 6,000 but the donation may have affected people giving donations over the last few months			1
' the two churches are now in negotiation about how and when the remaining money will be returned			0
but @entity70 , 72 , a congregation member of the church , which is one of the three oldest in @entity10 , said that she thought some form of compensation should be paid to the church from the solicitors			2
she said : ' it was a big mistake from the solicitors concerned and i think that there should be some compensation in it			0
' it is a big mistake to happen , but that ’s only my opinion			0
we are a big church but we have a very elderly congregation with limited income so donations are limited too			2
' we give a lot of the money we collect to charity , but at some point you have to look after yourself too			0
' we do have money invested elsewhere so the part we spent we can pay back just about , but it will be getting the invested amounts back , we ca n’t access that until february 2013			2
' we ’re appealing for money now , we ’re desperate , we do n’t know how we will pay it			0
' a joint statement issued by the @entity100 and @entity43 said : ' we recognise that the unfortunate circumstances in this matter have arisen through no one ’s deliberate fault			0
' the @entity105 of @entity106 , @entity43 and both parishes are working together to ensure a resolution of the problem that will give proper consideration to the best interests of both parishes and to effect an agreement by mutual consent			0
' we are not expecting any further legal costs to be incurred			0

clergymen at @entity8 in @entity9 , @entity10 have already spent £ 6,000 repairing the roof
they *'ve* got to pay the whole lot back but the rest is stuck in a savings investment bond until 2012
it actually belongs to a church *1.4miles* away and there are calls for the @entity9 church to be compensated
