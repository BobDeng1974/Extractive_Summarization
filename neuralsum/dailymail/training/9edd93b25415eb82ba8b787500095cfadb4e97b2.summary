the humble cabbage could be the key to protecting people from radiation during cancer therapy			0
researchers claim a compound derived from cruciferous vegetable - such as cabbage , cauliflower and broccoli - protected rats and mice from lethal doses of radiation			2
their study suggests the compound , already shown to be safe for humans , may protect normal tissues during radiation therapy for cancer treatment and prevent or mitigate sickness caused by radiation exposure			1
the humble cabbage could be the key to protecting people from radiation during cancer therapy , according to latest research in the @entity25 the compound - known as @entity26 ( or , 3 ' - diindolylmethane ) - previously has been found to have cancer preventative properties			2
the study 's corresponding author doctor @entity28 , of @entity30 in the @entity25 , said : ‘ @entity26 has been studied as a cancer prevention agent for years , but this is the first indication that @entity26 can also act as a radiation protector			1
’ for the study , the researchers irradiated rats with lethal doses of gamma ray radiation			0
the animals were then treated with a daily injection of @entity26 for two weeks , starting 10 minutes after the radiation exposure			1
their study suggests the compound , already shown to be safe for humans , may protect normal tissues during radiation therapy for cancer treatment and prevent or mitigate sickness caused by radiation exposure the @entity26 compound can be derived from cruciferous vegetable such as cabbage , cauliflower and broccoli the result was stunning , according to dr @entity28 , who is a professor of oncology , biochemistry and cell and molecular biology , and radiation medicine			1
he said : ‘ all of the untreated rats died , but well over half of the @entity26 - treated animals remained alive 30 days after the radiation exposure			1
’ dr @entity28 added that @entity26 also provided protection whether the first injection was administered 24 hours before or up to 24 hours after radiation exposure			1
he said : ‘ we also showed that @entity26 protects the survival of lethally irradiated mice			0
’ in addition , irradiated mice treated with @entity26 had less reduction in red blood cells , white blood cells and platelets - side effects often seen in patients undergoing radiation treatment for cancer			2
he said the study points to two potential uses of the compound , adding : ‘ @entity26 could protect normal tissues in patients receiving radiation therapy for cancer , but could also protect individuals from the lethal consequences of a nuclear disaster			0
’ dr @entity28 and his colleagues are co-inventors on a patent application that has been filed by @entity90 related to the usage of @entity26 and @entity26 - related compounds as radio - protectors			0
the research was published in the journal @entity96 .			0

the compound , called @entity26 , also reduced *severity* of radiation effects
this is the first time @entity26 has been found to act as a radiation protector
half of rats treated with @entity26 for two weeks after radiation exposure survived
the researchers have described their results as ' stunning '
