by @entity0 published : 01:13 est , 19 november 2013 updated : 09:13 est , 19 november 2013 when a multi-millionaire couple decided to wind - down their business empire and move to @entity5 they thought they were headed for sun , sea and relaxation			1
instead it triggered a 12 - year running battle with the tax authorities and now means the couple could face a £ 600,000 tax bill			1
@entity15 and @entity16 , who owned a grade 1 listed mansion and made a fortune in property development , insisted they had abandoned @entity21 as their home when they drove their mercedes to the continent in april 2001			1
the couple bought 16th century pile , @entity28 , near @entity29 , which mrs @entity16 ran as a restaurant and conference centre - working so hard that she eventually suffered a breakdown but the @entity34 - born parents - of - three , both aged 57 , are now facing up to tax bills totalling almost £ 600,000 after a tribunal ruled that their hearts had stayed in @entity38 and they had continued to view their farmhouse , in @entity29 , @entity40 , as their true home			1
from lowly beginnings as an engineering apprentice straight from school , mr @entity43 - who described himself as a ' hard hat man ' - had built up a phenomenally successful building and property development business			2
the couple 's energetic rise culminated in their purchase of @entity53 mansion , @entity28 , near @entity29 , which mrs @entity16 ran as a restaurant and conference centre - working so hard that she eventually suffered a breakdown			2
that was the trigger for the couple 's plan to ' tidy up ' their business affairs , escape the stress of it all and make a new life for themselves on the continent , judge @entity57 told the @entity68			0
after briefly living in an unfurnished flat in @entity70 - which was ' not to their taste ' - the couple built themselves a villa - the ' @entity76 ' - in @entity77 , @entity5 , intending to ' lead the easy life ' and settle down to enjoy the weather			0
however , their idyll was disturbed when @entity82 refused to accept that they were resident abroad in the tax years 2001 - 2005 and hit them with retrospective tax demands			1
the @entity86 , who lived at a farm in @entity88 before their departure , argued that they had intended to make their lives permanently abroad when they boarded the @entity94 - bound train in 2001			0
the couple built themselves a villa - the ' @entity76 ' - in @entity77 , @entity5 , intending to ' lead the easy life ' and settle down to enjoy the weather after years of hard work to establish their fortune , they said they wanted to retire and hoped the move would benefit mrs @entity16 's health as well as ' improving their quality of life '			1
they said they had only since returned to @entity38 as visitors to see friends and family - and never for more than the 90 days - a - year , the threshhold then applied by the tax authorities for overseas residence			0
however , dismissing the couple 's appeal , judge @entity57 noted mr @entity43 's ' deep suspicion ' of the tax authorities and found that their departure had not marked ' a distinct break ' with the @entity21			1
their youngest daughter was only 15 when they headed abroad but had stayed behind in @entity38			0
although her mother ' would have liked nothing better ' than for her to go with them to @entity5 , she did not want to leave @entity29 and could not be forced to move against her will			0
noting the couple 's , particularly mrs @entity16 's , close family links to @entity29 , the judge said they had never sold the farm and were ' not merely travellers ' when they stayed there during their frequent trips back to @entity38			0
although the couple protested that their intention to make their permanent home abroad ' could not have been more distinct or clear ' , the judge said that the farm had ' remained , essentially , a family home '			2
mr @entity43 had continued to be closely involved in winding down the couple 's businesses and , although there had been some ' loosening ' of their social and family bonds with @entity29 , it was not ' substantial ' enough to make them @entity150 residents .			0
