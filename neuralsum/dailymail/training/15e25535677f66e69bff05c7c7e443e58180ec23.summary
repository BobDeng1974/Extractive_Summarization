in an interview on this morning today , the antiques dealer also stated that when she finally decides to settle down in a monogamous relationship , her man wo n't cheat because , ' i 'd probably be able to keep him happy			1
' never in all of the years doing this have i wrecked a marriage			1
' i am absolutely sure i ’ve never personally split up a marriage			1
' she continued : ' i would never be like the woman in @entity30 and make anyone leave his wife			2
' there are so many men looking for an affair because it suits them			2
if he chooses to leave that is his choice			2
' if anyone has ever suggested it , they ’ve been dropped straight away			2
' talking of her first foray into the world of secret extra-marital trysts , she said : ' when i first signed up to dating sites , i soon figured most of the men were married			1
' they were n’t available after five o'clock and could n't see me during weekends			2
' they were keen during working hours and would occasionally slip away whilst washing the car on a sunday - but it was fairly obvious			0
' then i would get these very random text messages at times that you knew the wife was n't around			0
' that 's when ms @entity4 decided to sign up to an extra-marital dating site , something recent statistics show over a million fellow @entity62 have done			1
she said : ' it was nice to know where the boundaries were			0
' she continued : ' i ’m single and i love being single			0
i love my single life - i get to see my friends – and [ when i joined the site ] i did n’t particularly want a relationship with someone who would monopolise my time			0
' so she opted instead for married men , who would ' pop up every fortnight ' to see her before going back to their wives and family			1
48 - year - old divorcee @entity4 ( second from right ) shocked hosts @entity20 ( left ) and @entity21 ( second left ) and agony aunt @entity23 ( far right ) by saying her own man would never cheat on her @entity4 also attempted to justify her behaviour by claiming that not all of her relationships with married men were sexual			1
she said : ' they 're not all sexual			0
with a lot of guys it 's just friendships			0
' most guys have no one to talk to – they do n’t talk to friends about emotional problems			0
' since 2006 , ms @entity4 has dated over 100 married men and had ' fully blown affairs ' with 20 of them			1
although she claims not to have broken up any marriages , @entity4 admits that some of the affairs have left her feeling guilty			1
she said : ' there is some sense of guilt because women should know			0
i feel incredibly sorry for the wives who genuinely do n’t know			0
' but i also think that if a guy is on a site looking for an affair the they are already on that road			0
' if they are prepared to go looking for someone to have an affair with , they 'll have an affair			0
' talking of her first foray into the world of secret extra-marital trysts , @entity4 said : ' when i first signed up to dating sites i soon figured most of the men were married ' @entity4 has been dating married men for so long now that she has a set of guidelines that she initiates for every new relationship so the man 's wife does n't find out			1
she revealed : ' we sort out guidelines and rules beforehand - i do n’t date anywhere near home as i do n’t want to bump into someone with their wife in the supermarket			0
' i date far from home so i do n’t have to be twitchy			0
' but despite her willingness to get into a relationship with a married man , @entity4 revealed that she would drop a boyfriend in an instant if she found out they were cheating on her			1
she said : ' the second i knew about it he 'd be gone			2
i would not tolerate an affair			0
' i would not settle down with any man i 've dated			2
if they 're going to cheat once , they 'll cheat twice			2
' but she also expressed doubt any man of hers would cheat , saying : ' i 'd probably be able to keep him happy			1
