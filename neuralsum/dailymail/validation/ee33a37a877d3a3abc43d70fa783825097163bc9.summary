a celebrity neighbour row has taken a new twist after @entity2 hired architects and engineers to say how @entity6 ' basement pool could destroy his ' irreplaceable ' home			1
@entity8 veteran mr @entity2 , 71 , has sounded the fears for his @entity10 i listed house in @entity13 , @entity14 - a stone 's throw from the @entity19 star mr @entity6 ' £ 17.5million mansion			1
the pop star , who bought @entity22 's former 46 - room home in 2013 , first sparked mr @entity2 's ire last month with plans for an extension including a lift and recording studio			1
not a whole lotta love : former @entity19 singer @entity6 wants to extend his @entity14 mansion ( left ) - which allegedly could harm the @entity10 i lsited home ( right ) of his neighbour , @entity8 veteran @entity2 take that , @entity6 ! the singer ( left ) has received a fresh complaint from his neighbour @entity2 ( right ) then mr @entity38 submitted plans for a two - storey basement with a swimming pool - prompting drastic action from mr @entity2 , who has been in his house for 43 years			1
the @entity8 guitarist hired three firms - architects , structural engineers and town planners - to prepare three separate reports on why the development should be blocked			1
his biggest fear is that vibrations from the building works could harm his 1870s home , which he describes as a ' masterpiece '			2
over the years he has conserved the house as a ' custodian ' and claims his restorative works have been labelled ' exemplary ' by @entity59			2
described as one of the most important homes in the borough , the red - brick tower house was saved from demolition in the 1960s following a campaign led by @entity67 and @entity68			1
in his latest objection to @entity70 and @entity71 , mr @entity2 wrote : ' similar schemes have been carried out on other properties in the area locally and each time the level of vibration cause during the works has caused concern about the effect on decorative finishes of [ my ] house			0
stairway to bedlam : @entity6 's latest plans include a basement complete with a swimming pool , right @entity6 bought the house - which is the former home of @entity22 - with his wife @entity88 in 2013 ' the work now proposed is much nearer than other major excavations carried out so far and the consequences for the building fabric and decorative finishes ... may well be catastrophic if this project is allowed to proceed			1
' mr @entity2 's concerns have been supported by a report carried out on his behalf by historical building consultants @entity99			0
mr @entity100 , who has been practising as an architect for nearly 30 years , described mr @entity2 's house as ' one of the most important houses built in this country in the nineteenth century '			2
' excessive vibration from building works to the adjoining property could have disastrous effects on these decorative finishes ' , he wrote			0
his report added that it was possible the ' hand - made brickwork ' boundary wall between the two stars ' houses would collapse			0
surveyors from civil engineering firm @entity119 wrote that the home was ' designed by @entity121 , one of the greatest architects of the 19th century , as his home and contains original and irreplaceable interiors			0
' mr @entity6 ' house 's main bedroom , pictured during the time the late @entity22 lived at the property @entity6 bought the house in 2013 , after the director 's death , and is now keen to renovate the property the west @entity14 mansion , pictured in 2011 when @entity132 tried to sell it , includes a swimming pool room they added : ' these unparalleled interiors are of national significance and , we believe , are at serious risk if the applicant 's proposals ( as they currently stand ) are accepted			1
' and the @entity8 guitarist included a lengthy report from town planners @entity144 , which detailed how the plans allegedly fail to meet council recommendations			2
the 41 - year - old pop singer has said he is simply trying to turn his mansion into a modern family home			1
but his plans have also upset another wealthy neighbour , @entity154 heir @entity153			2
mr @entity153 wrote to @entity70 and @entity71 to complain about mr @entity6 ’s request to install air conditioning units at the bottom of his garden , which backs onto mr @entity153 ’s property			0
plans on the local council 's website show the extent to which @entity6 plans to re-tile his home 's roof the great - great grandson of mr @entity167 is worried the machines ’ noise will detract from his quality of life			1
he wrote that the three units together will produce a constant sound of @entity174 , ‘ which is nearly the same comparison as an adult speaking ’			0
another complaint has come to the council despite being 10,000 miles away in @entity178 , @entity179			0
despite the strongly - worded objections , one person sent a letter of support to the council			0
@entity185 , from @entity186 , wrote : ' as the custodian of several listed buildings and a scheduled ancient monument , it is my firm belief that heritage assets are best preserved by their continued use even if this means altering them significantly in order to meet their occupier 's needs			2
' the council is expected to make its decision on the initial plans by the end of this month			0
mr @entity6 and mr @entity2 have previously declined to comment .			0
