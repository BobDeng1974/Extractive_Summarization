drones have been used in emergencies and to capture the scope of natural disasters , but what if it was the new and improved way to simply walk your dog ? @entity9 and his @entity11 terrier @entity12 put ' drone dog walking ' to the test at an oval near their @entity17 home on monday			1
footage from the drone shows @entity12 hilariously running around , much to the delight of his owner who stumbled across the potential dog walking technique by accident			1
he was chasing after it and trying to jump and grab it , ' mr @entity9 told @entity37			2
' so yesterday when i took him for a walk , i brought the quadcopter with me and let him chase it around the sports oval near my house			2
' i thought it would make a fun video to point the camera at the ground and film him			2
i then simply tried to keep him in the centre of frame as best i could and keep the copter high enough that he could n't actually catch it			0
' @entity9 , who stumbled across the dog walking technique by accident , filmed his dog @entity12 hilariously running around the park with his tail wagging footage captured @entity12 wagging his tail as he tried to jump up in pursuit of the remote controlled quadcopter , before he chased it across the length of the oval			1
while there are limitations on where you can use a quadcopter in @entity71 , mr @entity9 said it 's an option he would consider using again at his local oval			1
' it is a great option for giving him exercise			0
he certainly runs around more than a typical walk , ' he said			0
@entity12 chased the drone across the length of the park thinking it was a bird , his owner said mr @entity9 said he tried to keep @entity12 in the centre of frame as best he could and keep the quadcopter high enough that he could n't actually catch it mr @entity9 said he had to make sure the quadcopter was out of @entity12 's reach due to the spinning blades footage captured @entity12 wagging his tail as he tried to jump up in pursuit of the remote controlled drone ' it was n't my initial thought to use it as a regular option but since the oval is at the end of my street , it will definitely be something i do on the weekend to keep him fit			1
the trick is to keep it just out of his reach so he ca n't catch it and make sure he is sitting next to me on take off and landing			0
' @entity106 have spinning blades so i wanted to make sure he would n't have a chance to actually get near them			0
thankfully he listens when told not to touch something			0
' mr @entity9 said @entity12 ran around much more than he would on a typical walk and was considering using the quadcopter again while there are limitations on where you can use a quadcopter in @entity71 , mr @entity9 said it 's an option he would consider using again at his local oval mr @entity9 said it was n't his initial thought to use the drone as a regular exercise option as he was just trying to learn how to fly the quadcopter mr @entity9 , who works for a public relations company , has been learning to fly a quadcopter over the past few weeks so he can train media to use them at an upcoming event launch for @entity129			1
he also works as a music video director on weekends with his own company @entity132 and has worked with the likes of @entity135 singer , passenger .			0
