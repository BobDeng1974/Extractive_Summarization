@entity1 powder turns to gel in stomach volunteers consumed 17 % fewer calories after in second meal methyl cellulose already used as an additive in ready meals by @entity9 published : 06:19 est , 22 august 2012 updated : 11:53 est , 22 august 2012 @entity10 as @entity11 , the @entity12 leader who loves to tell clients they should eat dust to lose weight a new ' anti-hunger ' powder claims to help dieters by making them feel fuller after eating just small amounts of food			1
added to smoothies , soups or fruit shakes the dust - like powder turns to a gel once it reaches the stomach meaning that the user will consume less calories in the meals afterwards , and lose weight as a result			1
a form of this magic diet powder , methyl cellulose , has been used as a popular food additive for over fifty years , binding together baked goods , snacks and ready meals			1
normally it would pass through the system , but this modified version has been designed as a satiety ingredient to form a gel at body temperature that lingers safely in the stomach before passing in to the small intestine			2
volunteers at trials consumed an average of 13 per cent fewer calories when given a second meal two hours after taking the powder , which dissolves in cold water			1
@entity54 the scientist who presented the report in @entity57 said : ' this ingredient would make people feel full after eating smaller amounts of food , ' ' with that sense of fullness and hunger - satisfaction , they would not crave more food			0
' in our first study , we saw that fewer calories were consumed at the following meal after eating our new product			1
' our next step now is to investigate in further studies the mechanism of action and whether this may have an impact on weight management			0
' a report by an @entity79 advisory committee said it ‘ did not have any safety concerns relating to this ingredient ’ but suggests it should not be given to children			0
they have asked food experts for their opinion before a decision is taken on approving it for use			0
@entity89 of the @entity90 said : ‘ although these findings are interesting , because this is a proof of concept study much more research is needed to understand the processes and mechanisms of action , as well as the implications for long term weight reduction			0
’ in its original form methyl cellulose is used as an additive in processed foods			2
the additive is used to bind food together and passes straight through the system without acting as any kind of satiety ingredient			0
chemists have modified the ingredient to use as a potential weight management tool , and the updated methyl cellulose powder has been named @entity112			2
@entity112 - @entity112 is a white powder dissolved in water and then added to edible liquids like smoothies , soups and shakes which turns in to a thick gel - like paste once it reaches room temperature in the stomach			2
this makes the user feel more full as it hangs around for a few hours before passing safely through to the small intestine and out of the body			0
in recent clinical trials the volunteers ate an average of 17 per cent fewer calories in their second meal after eating @entity112 in their first meal			1
the scientists are developing @entity112 - @entity112 as a potential ingredient in cold foods and dr @entity138 has reported that work will continue based on the promising clinical trial results			0
