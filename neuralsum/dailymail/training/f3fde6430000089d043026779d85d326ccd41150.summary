by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 17:08 est , 3 november 2012 updated : 21:11 est , 3 november 2012 @entity2 is sitting on a £ 1.5 trillion shale gas bonanza that could be worth more than the remaining @entity5 gas			1
the amount is bigger than previously thought and would potentially bring energy price stability and independence from imports for decades			0
although only about ten per cent of the gas is in unpopulated areas suitable for extraction , it would still be worth £ 150 billion			1
boost : @entity2 is sitting on a £ 1.5 trillion shale gas bonanza that could be worth more than the remaining @entity5 gas			1
it is hoped shale gas can transform the economy in the way @entity5 oil did in the @entity20 and @entity21 the level of untapped shale gas will be confirmed next month in a study by the @entity25 , commissioned by the @entity26 , according to industry sources			1
ministers are then likely to give the go - ahead for drilling , hoping the enormous economic benefits can win over environmental concerns			1
but critics say the environmental cost is too high for ‘ fracking ’ – or hydraulic fracturing , the controversial method of extracting gas by forcing water , sand and chemicals at high pressure 6,000ft underground			2
pilot wells caused two earthquakes in @entity45 last year and green campaigners warn the method could contaminate the water supply			0
@entity50 research also says that homeowners within two miles of a fracking site can expect property prices to plummet by almost a quarter			0
sources close to energy secretary @entity55 said he was ‘ quite excited about the prospect of a new domestic resource and probably wants to be able to exploit it , but it is quite a disruptive process and we need to go in with our eyes open ’			0
although the shale gas reserves are unlikely to mean a fall in gas prices , there could be enough to prevent expected big increases for years			1
oil and gas experts are also hopeful about the high concentration of gas in @entity2 rocks , which is richer than even @entity50 shale deposits and would require fewer wells			2
the @entity72 hopes that shale gas can transform the economy in the way @entity5 oil did in the @entity20 and @entity21			1
@entity77 has chaired a seminar to which he invited shale gas experts to come to @entity80			1
meanwhile the chancellor is considering a ‘ generous new tax regime ’ for drilling companies			0
energy minister @entity84 is expected to give the go - ahead for drilling , which has been suspended for the last year because of safety and environmental concerns			1
last year , @entity89 suspended its drilling operations after fracking caused two small earthquakes near @entity93			0
a senior industry source with intimate knowledge of the @entity25 survey said : ‘ when the survey announces the size of the reserve , it will be an enormous figure			2
the potential is that it will be a bigger number than the total recovery from the @entity5			0
’ hopeful : sources close to energy secretary @entity55 said he was ' quite excited ' about the prospect of a new domestic resource substantial recoverable gas could enhance @entity2 ’s energy security , offset declining @entity5 output and reduce import dependence			0
about 70 per cent of the @entity5 gas and oil reserves have been used up and in 20 years @entity2 will be dependent on gas from abroad – mainly @entity113 and @entity114			2
however , only about ten per cent of the shale gas is available for commercial exploitation because much of it has been found in heavily populated areas , such as the @entity119 , @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity123 and the @entity124			1
many of these areas have already suffered a property price collapse , and so fracking would be likely to provoke fierce opposition			0
an @entity131 poll last month showed 67 per cent of homeowners would rather have a wind turbine near their home than a fracking well			2
but @entity89 claims the estimated 200 trillion cubic feet of shale gas in the @entity138 in the @entity119 could create 5,600 jobs			1
pro-frackers say the landscape is disturbed for a few months during initial drilling and that the ground can be returned to its former use			0
but @entity145 claims that the longer - term effects below ground could be catastrophic			0
@entity148 , of the charity , said : ‘ our objection to shale gas is there are risks of water contamination by methane and chemicals , and the process involves very high use of water anyway			1
then there ’s the risk of earth tremors			0
‘ we do n’t think shale gas would even stop the rise in gas prices anyway and it is another fossil fuel creating carbon			2
plus there is the risk methane will leak out , and it is a very powerful greenhouse gas			0

although only about ten per cent of the gas is in unpopulated areas suitable for extraction , it would still be worth £ 150 billion
the level of untapped shale gas will be confirmed next month in a study by the @entity25
ministers are then likely to give the go - ahead for drilling , hoping the enormous economic benefits can win over environmental concerns
