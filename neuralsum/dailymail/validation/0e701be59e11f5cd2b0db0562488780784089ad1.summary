@entity0 did not attend @entity1 on sunday			1
a lot of people tend to get upset when this happens			0
the one who does n’t is @entity0			1
if he wanted to go , as a guest of either @entity7 or @entity8 , his former clubs , he could have secured a ticket , no problem			1
the @entity11 would probably love to have him , too			0
the issue is n’t that @entity0 is short of invitations			2
he ’s just not that into it			0
@entity0 was a great player , and does n't need a fuss around him when he decides not to attend games this can happen when you ’re 75			1
@entity0 thinks of @entity1 and , as much as the match — which he would enjoy — he imagines the queues of traffic on the @entity26 , the hassles of parking and of spending the hour before kick - off having a big fuss made about his presence when he would rather be sat with a pot of tea in front of @entity31 and @entity32 and then the rugby			1
truth be told , if @entity38 versus @entity37 captured his attention , he might even have delayed changing channels until it was over			0
he finds it strange that people are still interested in getting him to @entity1			2
we want our heroes to behave like besotted fans , but @entity34 ’s interests were always broader			0
@entity0 ' interests were always broader than just football , and he should be left to enjoy his retirement he liked playing , and was quite brilliant at it , but since retiring he ’s as likely to be engrossed in a test match as a cup final , and he has n’t the ego to wish to be feted wherever he goes			1
he does n’t claim to be an expert on the modern game , having not been a part of it for so long , but feels no animosity towards the @entity60 or its high - earning players			0
for a man whose problems with alcohol led him to a psychiatric unit shortly after retirement , the second act of @entity34 ’s life has been a triumph			0
we should perhaps acknowledge this , rather than wonder why he is n’t constantly seeking attention or another lap of honour			0
we should wish every former athlete the quiet contentment of @entity0			1
@entity0 does n't claim to be an expert about the modern game , and did n't want to attend the @entity81 fianl			2

@entity8 and @entity7 *legend* @entity0 chose not to go to @entity1
@entity0 said he would rather watch the rugby than his former clubs
the @entity88 *striker* should not have his *decision* *challenged*
as a former great @entity0 has the right to a quiet retirement
