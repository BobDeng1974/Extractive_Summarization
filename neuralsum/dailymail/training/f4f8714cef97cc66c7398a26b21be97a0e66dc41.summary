just sit back and savour the ambush			0
eight months on from storming the @entity1 to deliver a rare @entity3 title , sorcerer @entity4 produced another emphatic show of alchemy , conjuring up a magnificent blueprint to out - box the @entity9 and shake up the established world order 10 months out from the @entity11			2
on a day when @entity13 and @entity14 were swatted aside by the southern hemisphere giants they had welcomed into their lair , @entity4 ’s @entity12 showed their neighbours exactly what it takes to take out on of the touring big hitters – heart , relentless work - rate , canny tactics and ultimately some beautifully crafted tries			2
swatting aside the build - up that had dominated by pessimism surrounding the injury situation and the limited training window , the fact of the matter was that @entity12 were still resourced by a strong central spine of the side that secured @entity3 glory in @entity35			2
@entity12 players celebrate after @entity38 's try during their 29 - 15 victory over @entity9 at the @entity40 fly half @entity41 of @entity12 is tackled by centre @entity43 of @entity9 as he tries to escape with the ball @entity12 : @entity46 ( @entity47 , 74 ) ; @entity48 , @entity49 ( @entity50 , 79 ) , @entity51 , @entity52 ; @entity53 ( @entity54 , 74 ) , @entity55 ; @entity57 ( @entity56 , 74 ) , @entity58 ( @entity59 , 59 ) , @entity60 ( @entity61 , 74 ) , @entity63 ( @entity62 , 74 ) , @entity64 , @entity65 ( @entity66 , 71 ) , @entity67 , @entity68			1
tries : @entity67 , @entity38 @entity70 : @entity41 ( 4 ) , @entity54 ; cons : @entity41 ( 2 )			1
@entity9 : @entity72 ; @entity73 ( @entity74 , 50 ) , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 ; @entity78 ( @entity79 , 67 ) , @entity80 ( @entity81 , 57 ) ; @entity83 ( @entity82 , 67 ) , @entity84 ( a @entity59 , 51 ) , j du @entity85 , 71 ) , @entity87 ( @entity86 , 65 ) , @entity88 , @entity90 ( @entity89 , 71 - 77 ) , @entity91 ( @entity92 , 47 ) , @entity93			1
tries : @entity90 , @entity74 pen : @entity78 ; con : @entity78			0
and despite having their best laid plan hit late on by @entity99 succumbing pre-match to a virus , an illness that handed @entity103 just his second @entity105 start , the home side exhibited tremendous first - half defensive bottle , which put manners on @entity9 ’s feared physicality , and they then confidently hit their stride on the resumption to race to what ultimately was a comfortable margin of victory			1
as witnessed in 2009 , when @entity41 , in only his second start , put the boot through @entity9 at @entity116 , @entity12 , in terms of growing their depth , has nothing to lose in gambling on the experimental midfield of @entity122 and @entity123 and going in with two - thirds of a rejigged front row where @entity126 was making just his third start and @entity128 was finally starting his first test since the @entity130			1
@entity57 , at the scrum , and @entity133 , with his throwing , endured some moments of anxiety during the tensely - fought first half , but there was never a feeling that they would n’t pull through this examination			0
@entity67 , too , equally grew into the contest , but special mention must go to @entity122 , the 21 - year - old about whom so much was expected stepping into an @entity146 midfield no longer occupied by @entity147 and @entity148			0
having learnt his trade as provincial full - back last season before running the 13 channel in the opening few months this season , he had suddenly found himself shunted one positon further in in his first proper @entity105 start			0
he readjusted to the role with savvy , as did new cap @entity123 outside him , and their role in keeping @entity12 ’s defence solid during the win - creating opening half was vital			2
the opening narrative was how competitive @entity12 were on the back foot in forcing a surfeit of turnovers , being efficient on rare attacks and ultimately being very good value for the 6 - 3 advantage they took with them into the interval , @entity41 ’s two penalties on nine and 24 minutes trumping one from @entity173 two minutes from the break			1
@entity9 's flanker @entity175 ( third left ) runs with the ball during the first half of the @entity179 @entity9 's fly half @entity173 ( second left ) is tackled by @entity12 's centre @entity123 ( left ) during the first half @entity12 's @entity183 ( centre ) is tackled by @entity9 's @entity185 ( front ) in a ruck surrounded by several other players however , @entity12 really needed to stick it the man for belief to flow that this would indeed be their evening			1
this they did with chutzpah , @entity67 scoring the game - changing opening try just one minute and 45 seconds after the resumption			0
gathering inside his own 22 , he could have punted to touch and given the @entity9 a restarting lineout somewhere near halfway			0
however , without test action since last november ’s humdinger against @entity202 , the winger reminded us what he can by punting a contestable kick and then racing forward to cleanly fetch in the air			0
with that , @entity12 probed left and @entity51 executed a lovely kick to the corner , follow - up pressure from the centre earning a lineout just metres out			2
@entity213 fetched and @entity67 shunted though a gap in the maul to ground for the try converted by @entity41			0
@entity9 ’s quickly launch their bench , but initial attempts to curb @entity12 ’s 13 - 3 lead lacked accuracy due to continued well - drilled home defence			1
@entity12 's @entity222 ( right ) and @entity9 's @entity224 tussle for the ball in a tight game at the @entity40 @entity78 of @entity9 kicks the ball as his team - mate and the referee watch on during the first half scrum half @entity185 of @entity9 throws the ball out of the ruck during the first half of the match @entity12 's @entity222 ( left ) is challenged by @entity9 's @entity236 as he gets away from him with the ball @entity12 's @entity238 takes an uncontested lineout during the match as @entity242 players watch on that was until the 57th minute			1
handed a kickable penalty , the @entity9 went for the corner and after @entity246 collected , @entity175 bounded over off the resulting maul			1
@entity78 ’s conversion reeled the margin to the three - point gap it had been at the break , but the visitors could n’t build on this riposte , @entity255 going high on @entity238 six minutes later and @entity41 punishing the offence with aplomb			2
next , a great strip in the tackle by @entity51 put the skids on a @entity90 advance and when replacement @entity262 rashly collided with the aerial @entity222 , the @entity9 went a player down with their 67th minute yellow card			0
that set the stage for @entity12 to close out just their fifth win in 22 attempts against @entity9			1
they probed excellently , their initial pay - off being a @entity41 penalty four minutes later by @entity41 after replacement prop @entity272 failed to heed ruck warnings from referee @entity274			0
that gloriously was n’t all , though			0
@entity41 exploded off scrum ball , bursting past another replacement , @entity280 , and from the ensuing ruck , @entity277 ’s vision was 20/20 , his sublime box kick getting collected by @entity38 for the try @entity41 converted for a handsome 16 - point lead			1
the @entity9 were busted , inviting @entity4 to clear his bench			0
@entity286 soon added a penalty and while @entity74 ran in an unconverted try , it could n’t smudge the polish of this outstanding @entity146 ambush			0
@entity12 's @entity103 ( centre ) celebrates with @entity292 after scoring the first try against @entity9 @entity9 's @entity294 ( right ) makes his way through a tackle from @entity12 's @entity103 @entity12 's @entity38 celebrates scoring his try in the second half as they defeat the @entity9 @entity74 ( left ) goes over for a late consolation try for @entity9 against @entity12 as they lost 29 - 15			1

@entity41 stars with the boot for @entity12 in a man - of - the - match display as they beat @entity9
@entity103 scored his first international try and @entity38 also goes over
