@entity0 fought back from a set down to beat alternate @entity2 in his final group b match at the @entity4 in @entity5			1
@entity0 ’s 4 - 6 , 6 - 4 , 6 - 1 victory over @entity2 means that @entity7 has to beat @entity8 in straight sets at the @entity10 on thursday night to qualify for the semi-finals			1
@entity8 , meanwhile , is already guaranteed progression to the last four by virtue of @entity2 winning a set			2
@entity0 celebrates after beating @entity2 4 - 6 , 6 - 4 , 6 - 1 at the @entity10 in @entity15 @entity2 hangs his head after he misses @entity0 's return on the way to losing the match 1			1
if @entity8 defeats @entity7 , then @entity8 wins the group and @entity0 qualifies in second place			2
if @entity7 defeats @entity8 in straight sets , then @entity7 wins the group and @entity8 qualifies in second place			1
if @entity7 defeats @entity8 in three sets , then @entity8 wins the group and @entity0 qualifies in second place			1
but the @entity28 will no doubt go all out for the win against @entity7 to avoid a likely semi-final clash with world no 1 @entity31			0
@entity0 had ironically eliminated @entity2 from the race to @entity5 two weeks ago by beating him in the quarter - finals of the @entity35			2
but the pair faced off again here after world no 10 @entity2 replaced @entity39 , who pulled out on thursday morning with a muscle tear in his thigh			0
although @entity2 could not qualify , there was plenty at stake with 200 ranking points and an extra £ 98,500 in prize money if he could win			0
@entity2 winning a set means that @entity8 is already guaranteed progression out of @entity15 @entity2 had two chances to break in the fifth game but could not convert and @entity0 made him pay in the next game with a clean forehand cross-court winner for the break			2
@entity0 faltered when trying to consolidate and @entity2 broke back before later breaking for the set as the nervy @entity54 dumped a smash into the net			0
however , world no 5 @entity0 instantly mounted a comeback as he broke in the opening game of the second set			0
@entity0 's victory put a dent in @entity7 's hopes , with the @entity64 having to beat @entity8 in straight sets @entity2 stayed within touch and forced @entity0 to serve the second set out which he duly did to level the match			1
this was the first three - set match of the week and @entity0 would have felt confident heading into the decider with an impressive 20 - 2 record in matches that have gone the distance this year			0
and he cruised to victory as an immediate break proved demoralising for @entity2 and @entity0 won five of the next six games to seal victory in one hour and 56 minutes .			0

@entity0 came from a set down to beat @entity2 4 - 6 , 6 - 4 , 6 - 1
@entity7 must now beat @entity8 in straight sets to go through
@entity2 was a late replacement for the *injured* @entity39
