according to retired sociology professor @entity7 , modern - day society encourages people to be individuals and not let their emotions get in the way			1
in the journal @entity13 , professor @entity7 said shame is the ' most obstructed and hidden emotion , and therefore the most destructive , ' and may have been one of the underlying causes of the @entity19 war , and other forms of aggression			1
professor @entity7 said shame is the ' most hidden emotion , and therefore the most destructive			1
' he added : ' the @entity25 administration may have been embarrassed by 9/11 and their helplessness to punish the attackers ' and the invasion of @entity19 ' might have served to hide their shame behind aggression			1
' @entity31 image pictured ' emotions are like breathing - they cause trouble only when obstructed , ' said the @entity36 professor emeritus			2
when hidden , he continued , shame causes serious struggles not only for individuals but also for groups			0
@entity7 suggested that shame - or the reaction to it - can also manifest itself in larger acts of aggression , such as wars and other military conflicts			1
' especially for leaders , both shame and anger are carefully hidden behind a veil of rationality , ' he said			2
‘ the @entity25 administration may have been deeply embarrassed by the 9/11 attack during their watch and their helplessness to punish the attackers			0
the invasion of @entity19 on the basis of false premises might have served to hide their shame behind anger and aggression			1
’ in the article , @entity7 examined the ubiquity of hidden shame and suggested it may be one of the keys to understanding contemporary society			2
according to professor @entity7 , a society that fosters individualism is a ' ripe breeding ground for the emotion of shame ' because people are encouraged to ' go it alone , no matter the cost to relationships			1
this feature has constructive and creative sides , but it has at least two other implications : alienation and the hiding of shame ' according to @entity7 , a society that fosters individualism is a ' ripe breeding ground for the emotion of shame ' because people are encouraged to ' go it alone , no matter the cost to relationships			1
' ' people learn to act as if they were complete in themselves and independent of others			0
this feature has constructive and creative sides , but it has at least two other implications : alienation and the hiding of shame			0
' @entity7 continued that while shame is no less prevalent now than in previous years , decades or generations , it has become more hidden : ' shame is a biological entity like other emotions , but people are more ashamed of it than they are of the others ' professor @entity7 said			1
' the hiding of emotions is more widespread in modern societies than in traditional ones			2
' the best way to resolve shame , according to professor @entity7 , pictured , is to ' laugh at yourself or at the universe , but not at other people ' in exploring the connection between shame and aggression , @entity7 cited research by sociologist @entity119 , author of @entity120 : the @entity121 of @entity122			1
@entity123 - the act of one spouse killing the other as well as their children and often himself or herself - stems from unacknowledged shame , professor @entity7 claimed			1
' it 's about humiliation and hiding behind aggression or violence , ’ he explained			0
‘ the most interesting thing about the study is there 's a group of non-angry people - a minority - who lose their job and feel humiliated			0
so they pretend they 're going to work every day but are really planning the killing			0
@entity142 describes them as ' civic respectable			0
' ' our society is civic respectable , ' professor @entity7 added			1
' you 're not to be angry and you 're not to be ashamed			0
' the problem with that kind of thinking , however , is that shame is , in reality , a very useful emotion			0
‘ shame is the basis of morality , ’ @entity7 said			2
‘ you ca n't have a moral society without shame			0
it provides the weight for morality			0
there are a hundred things in your head about what you should or should n't do , but the one that hits you is the one that has shame behind it			0
’ while some people are more susceptible to the effects of shame , for others the emotion is more manageable			2
‘ those lucky rascals who as children were treated with sympathetic attention from at least one of their caregivers feel more pride - accepted as they are - and , therefore , less shame and rejection , ’ professor @entity7 continued			1
the best way to resolve shame , according to professor @entity7 is to ' laugh at yourself or at the universe , but not at other people			1
' most of the laughing we do in comedy is good			0
no matter the actors , we are really laughing at our own selves that we see in their foolishness			0

professor @entity7 claimed shame may be to blame for aggression
he said anger is a result of bottling up feelings of embarrassment
societies that promote individualism encourage the emotion of shame
this is because they preach that it ’s fine to ' go it alone ' and hide emotions
people are told not to be angry and ashamed , and this can be *detrimental*
professor @entity7 linked the @entity19 war to the shame the @entity221 felt about the 9/11 attacks
