why is everyone so tired all the time ? i am one of the country ’s leading holistic doctors who specialises in tiredness , and in this ground - breaking series i will show you how to conquer exhaustion by making small adjustments to your lifestyle			1
in part one i highlighted the hidden causes of feeling worn out			0
here , i present the three - week energy cleanse that will help you feel refreshed			1
@entity15 takeaways , chocolate and a good night out — i like them as much as the next person and i know how hard they are to give up			1
takeaways are not only bad for weight gain , they also contribute to exhaustion the trouble is that they contribute not only to weight gain , but also to our collective exhaustion			1
but drastic lifestyle changes ca n’t happen overnight			0
so , i ’ve devised a three - week cleanse that will wean you off sugar and reset your metabolic balance to help you regain vitality			1
i ’ve taken the best of all the many detox and weight - loss regimes i ’ve tried to create the easiest plan to follow : there ’s no need to hibernate or give up work and your social life			1
people often presume a detox is just about what they eat , but it ’s also important to cleanse your mind , use natural skin products that contain few or no chemicals and let go of negative emotions to restore your energy			1
another good reason to do a detox or cleanse programme at least twice a year is to give the digestive system a rest			1
it produces as much serotonin , the happy chemical , as our brain , so a sluggish gut can affect our mood , mental well - being and energy levels			0
dump all energy - zapping processed foods , potatoes , pasta , bread , cake , desserts , chocolates , crisps , junk foods , fizzy drinks , tea , coffee and milk from your house			2
take them to a food bank or give them to a friend or relative			2
as i explained on saturday , processed sugar causes spikes in our body ’s blood sugar			1
this causes a temporary surge in energy , but then causes a massive crash that leads us to feel more tired			0
on the other hand , a diet rich in protein such as meat , fish and eggs excites orexin cells in our brain ( a protein - like molecule that regulates mental processes from sleepiness to hunger ) , boosting our energy levels			1
good nutrition is how we absorb sunlight and energise our bodies			2
the shopping list printed on the right is full of delicious nutritious foods to help us connect with the earth and sunlight and feed our own natural source of energy			2
you do not have to get everything , but it is an indication for what you can eat during the plan			2
shop just once a week , as this cuts down on the temptation to buy unhealthy food			1
week 1 the first week is a gentle induction to wean yourself off your old , unhealthy diet			1
the key is to avoid hunger , as that will make you more likely to give in to unhealthy snacks			1
an omelette with some meat or vegetarian sausages is a good option for breakfast have a breakfast high in protein , as studies have shown this boosts your energy , helps burn fat throughout the day and keeps you feeling fuller for longer			1
for lunch and dinner , divide an average - sized dinner plate into four quarters and fill it as follows : half with vegetables or salad , a quarter with protein and a quarter with carbohydrates , such as brown rice or couscous or sweet potatoes			1
the two things people struggle with most is detoxifying from caffeine and sugar			0
if you ’re struggling without coffee ( withdrawal normally lasts only two to three days ) , have a diluted cup made with half your usual amount , and cut it down by a cup a day			1
@entity178 for a few days is also acceptable , but it ’s better to go cold turkey			2
if you ’re battling sugar cravings , you can take an amino acid supplement called l - glutamine , available from health shops			1
you can take one capsule of 500mg up to once an hour , and if taken on an empty stomach it can trick the body into thinking it has sugar in its system			2
@entity191 : breakfast choose from : snack choose from : lunch divide your plate into four and ensure it consists of the following : snack try to snack on fruit to avoid feeling drowsy during the day time dinner as for lunch , divide your plate into four : top tips for eating out week 2 the difference this week is that there are two liquid meals a day ( juice , smoothie or soup )			1
the best fuel for your body is fruit and vegetables , and juicing them is beneficial because you can drink more than you can eat , and drinking freshly made juice gives your digestive system a rest			1
two liquid meals a day are proscribed by dr @entity221 if you juice 80g each of four different fruit or vegetables , that can count as four out of your five a day			1
and nutrients are absorbed easily			0
i advise a liquid breakfast and dinner , and your big meal at lunch , so you have a long time for your digestive system to rest and repair overnight			2
a big meal at lunchtime may seem tricky at work , but most workplaces have a microwave so you can reheat something you ’ve prepared			2
if not , make a large salad with couscous and cold meat ( for great recipe ideas , see right )			1
if you are new to liquid meals , you can start with one a day , for breakfast , and then by week three you can build up to the two liquid meals a day if you can manage it			2
if you really feel you can not do this , just continue to ‘ eat clean ’ ( ie within the para-meters of the shopping list )			2
keep well hydrated with herbal tea or water			0
any time throughout you feel hungry and you have already drunk a glass of water , you can snack on fruit , vegetables and hummus , seeds or nuts			1
the amount of carbo - hydrates is reduced this week			2
the other change is supplements i recommend you take : so , your programme will look like this : breakfast snack nuts constitute a ' clean ' snack in between meals lunch snack dinner week 3 by now you will feel amazing and used to the @entity277 eating plan , which you ’ll continue this week			1
it ’s time to increase exercise and perform an ‘ emotional detox ’			0
your energy levels should have rocketed , so focus on goals and resolve any issues that might be causing you stress and exacerbating tiredness			0
the worst thing you can do after the three week plan is splurge on foods like cheese reflect on what you want out of life , what you do well and have n’t done so well			2
write a plan to achieve any goals in a realistic time frame			0
the more in tune you become with yourself , the greater the improvement in your health , energy and quality of life			0
what to do after the three - week @entity15 the worst thing you can do is go on a massive binge of chocolate , cheese and bread			2
most people i know who did ended up suffering with stomach cramps			0
eat two ‘ clean ’ meals a day ( with ingredients from the shopping list ) , then have small amounts of wheat and dairy if you want for your third meal			1
also try to have two completely ‘ clean ’ days in the week			0
this gives your body a chance to recover from any excesses			0
by this time you should be brimming with vitality and enthusiasm for your new lifestyle			0
