@entity0 suffered form leg ulcers that confined him to a wheelchair after a brisk hike in the wilds of the @entity6 , @entity3 usually felt tired but invigorated			1
the walking breaks with his wife , @entity9 , and a group of friends were a welcome distraction from his job as a taxi driver in @entity15 , @entity16			1
but one evening , back at his hotel , he noticed a slightly sore , red patch on his shin , about the size of a 10p piece			2
' i did n't think too much of it and just went to sleep , ' says father - of - two @entity0 , 66 , who also has three grandchildren			1
' but when i woke next morning the skin over the patch had broken away and there was a little hole in my leg			2
' when it failed to heal after a few days , he went to his gp and was tested for type 2 diabetes - leg ulcers are a classic complication of the disease			1
although @entity0 was slightly overweight , he was quite fit			2
but there was a family history of the condition , with his mother and brother both affected			2
when the result came back positive , it was clear that diabetes had already started to damage his circulation almost beyond repair			1
the tiny ulcer was due to damage to the lining of the major blood vessels supplying the lower half of his body - damage caused by constant exposure to raised sugar levels			1
as circulation suffers , ' peripheral ' areas such as the skin on the lower legs and feet become starved of nutrients			1
if the skin gets sore or even slightly injured , it breaks down			2
@entity0 , then in his mid- 50s , did n't know he was about to descend into a ten - year nightmare during which both his lower legs would become covered in ulcers that would not heal			1
it would leave him in a wheelchair , in almost permanent agony and facing the terrifying threat of his legs being amputated after doctors tried every available treatment without success			1
some ulcers stayed for years			1
others cleared up , only to be replaced by more			2
every few days , community nurses would call at his home to change his dressings			2
at one point he was even referred to a psychiatrist for a mental health assessment , such was the psychological toll			2
but last year @entity0 stumbled across a ' cure ' that sounds so implausible most health professionals would understandably laugh at the idea : sugar			1
ordinary , granulated white sugar - the sort we put in our tea , that costs less than 40p a pound - has proved to be an unlikely remedy			1
poured on to @entity0 's weeping wounds , it took a little over a month to heal what costly treatments failed to fix in a decade			1
@entity99 poured on to @entity0 's weeping wounds took a little over a month to heal today @entity0 's legs are completely healed , though badly scarred , and he has n't had an ulcer in almost 18 months			1
his wheelchair has been stowed away , he is pain - free , and can walk and even swim			2
@entity0 says : ' when the final dressings were removed , i was speechless			2
i could n't believe how much my legs had improved			1
' i 've even managed to go on a cruise with my wife and surprised my sister , who lives in @entity109 , by turning up on her doorstep			0
' @entity99 is one of the oldest known remedies for healing wounds			0
in 3500 bc the @entity114 dressed wounds with sugary substances such as honey or resin			0
@entity99 works mainly by drawing excess moisture out of infected wounds			0
although some moisture is needed for new skin cells to grow , too much can trigger maceration - the softening of tissues by liquid - which provides the ideal breeding ground for bacteria			0
once sugar is sprinkled on a weeping wound , it starts to absorb excess water			1
there is also some evidence that it draws macrophages - immune - system cells that can attack foreign organisms - into the damaged area as well			0
about 6,000 people a year in @entity139 have leg , foot or toe amputations due to diabetes complications			1
the annual @entity145 bill for treating ulcers alone is estimated at nearly £ 700 million			1
the market for wound dressings , ointments and gels is said to be worth around £ 5 billion			0
@entity0 decided to try the sugar treatment after reading a brief news report in the @entity153 last year about a small - scale trial at @entity155			1
@entity156 , a senior lecturer in adult nursing , had set up the trial because he did n't understand why sugar - commonly used as a cheap wound - healer in his native @entity160 - was not given to patients in the @entity162			1
@entity0 says : ' i mentioned the article to my gp , who said that after everything i 'd been through , i had nothing to lose			0
' so i rang @entity156 and the very next morning he drove 90 miles to my house to see me			0
' as it happened , there were a couple of wound care nurses there to change my dressings			0
when @entity156 looked at my ulcers and said they should be completely healed in four to five weeks using just sugar , i could see them sniggering			1
' mr @entity156 piped a ring of @entity181 around each lesion to keep the sugar contained , then sprinkled between half a teaspoon and two teaspoons on them			1
although over-the - counter sugar is almost certainly safe , he uses white sugar treated with antiseptic , just to make certain there are no lingering micro-organisms			1
each ulcer was then topped with a patch containing iodine , dressed with a light , comfortable bandage , then left for up to a week			0
when the first dressing was changed after seven days , @entity0 was stunned			0
' i rarely swear , but i did then			0
where my large ulcers had been oozing pus and blood , there was none			1
it just looked a bit raw			0
' by the fourth week , word had got round and when @entity156 came back to remove the final bandages , there was a crowd of 15 to 20 healthcare professionals in my house to watch			0
' as the dressings came off , you could hear everybody gasp			0
every ulcer had completely healed			0
' i was feeling quite emotional and asked @entity9 to fetch my shoes because i wanted to stand outside the front of my house for the first time in years			1
she reminded me that i did n't have any shoes , because when doctors had said i 'd probably never walk again , we gave them to charity			0
' mr @entity156 says the results of his trial are due to be published in a peer - reviewed journal later this year			0
but he claims the initial results suggest a diabetic ulcer cure rate in excess of 90 per cent			0
he says the reason sugar is not used more in developed nations is simply that it is so cheap , there is n't enough profit to justify investing in large - scale randomised trials			1
these provide the proof necessary to win endorsement from bodies such as the @entity238 ( @entity238 )			0
but while research evidence is scant , it is still fairly convincing			0
one of the largest studies , published in the @entity242 in 1981 , involved 605 patients in the @entity244 with wounds , burns and ulcers			1
the results showed that healing times were reduced by 25 per cent , they needed fewer skin grafts and antibiotics , and the cost of their long - term care was greatly reduced			0
a 2007 study in the @entity256 compared wounds treated with sugar and honey			1
doctors at the @entity261 in @entity262 treated 18 patients with sugar dressings and 22 with honey			1
@entity0 's wounds have now healed after a week , the proportion of patients showing signs of wound infection had fallen from 52 to 39 per cent among the sugar group , and from 55 to 23 per cent in those drizzled with honey			2
honey is thought to mainly promote healing through direct antibacterial action			0
unlike sugar , it has emerged as more of a mainstream wound remedy in recent years , with a host of new specialist dressings incorporating medical - grade ( sterilised ) honey			1
honey contains vitamins , minerals , enzymes and sugars , all of which help to heal wounds			0
@entity288 is generally regarded as the most potent because of its high antibacterial content , although it costs up to £ 20 a jar , as against £ 2 to £ 3 for other honeys			0
@entity99 is cheaper , which may be why it is not being used			0
@entity295 , one of the @entity162 's leading experts on wound healing , says he remembers being invited to a meeting in @entity299 in the @entity300 by sugar giant @entity301 to discuss the company 's plans to develop sugar into a drug that would transform wound - healing			2
' they were very excited , ' says professor @entity295			0
' but then i heard no more about it			0
whether they were warned it might be unfair competition for companies developing more expensive wound - care treatments , i do n't know			0
what i do know is that sugar works			2
' professor @entity316 , consultant vascular surgeon at the @entity317 , says a major obstacle is that sugar ca n't be patented			2
when a pharmaceutical firm develops a new drug , it is usually protected by patent for at least five years in hope of recouping the millions of pounds spent on research			2
undaunted , @entity3 is doing all he can to spread the word			1
he recently wrote to the chief medical officer for @entity139 , dame @entity327 , and has met his local mp to discuss the matter			0
' this sugar treatment has given me back my life , ' says @entity0			2
' i want to do all i can to support it			0

@entity3 , 66 , from @entity15 , @entity16 , has diabetes
for 10 years , his lower legs were constantly covered in agonising ulcers
but when he started pouring sugar on them , they *disappeared* in a month
