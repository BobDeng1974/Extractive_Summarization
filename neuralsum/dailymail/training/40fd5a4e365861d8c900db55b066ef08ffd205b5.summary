by @entity1 reporter published : 17:00 est , 25 november 2012 updated : 19:43 est , 25 november 2012 police who investigated the disappearance of @entity6 's two - year - old daughter admitted today that they overlooked a @entity8 search for ' fool - proof ' suffocation on the day the girl was last seen alive			1
captain @entity11 said on sunday that his office 's computer investigator missed the june 16 , 2008 internet search			1
it is not known who performed the search but it was allegedly done with a browser primarily used by the two - year - old 's mother , @entity6 , who was acquitted of the girl 's murder in 2011			1
troubling : on the day that two - year - old @entity6 disappeared , someone at the @entity25 home searched ' fool - proof suffocation '			1
her mother @entity27 ( right ) was acquitted of her murder in 2011 acquitted : @entity6 reacts as she is found not guilty in the murder of her daughter @entity6			1
she is flanked by her attorneys , @entity31 , left , and @entity32 , right @entity35 's attorneys argued during trial that @entity6 helped her father , @entity35 , cover up the girl 's drowning in the family pool			1
@entity42 reports that sheriff 's investigators pulled 17 vague entries only from the computer 's @entity47 browser , not the @entity49 commonly used by @entity6			1
more than 1,200 @entity51 entries , including the suffocation search , were overlooked			0
whoever conducted the @entity8 search looked for the term ' fool - proof suffication ' , misspelling ' suffocation ' , and then clicked on an article about suicide that discussed taking poison and putting a bag over one 's head			1
the browser then recorded activity on the social networking site @entity66 , which was used by @entity6 but not her father			1
a computer expert for @entity35 's defense team found the search before the trial			2
her lead attorney , @entity31 , first mentioned the search in his book about the case but suggested it was @entity35 who conducted the search after @entity6 drowned because he wanted to kill himself			1
murdered : @entity6 , 2 , was last seen on june 16 , 2008 , the same day that ' foolproof suffocation ' was searched on the @entity35 family computer concession : captain of @entity84 sheriff 's office @entity11 spoke to reporters about the @entity6 evidence today not knowing about the computer search , prosecutors had argued @entity6 was poisoned with chloroform and then suffocated by duct tape placed over her mouth and nose			1
the girl 's body was found six months after she disappeared in a field near the family home and was too decomposed for an exact cause of death to be determined			1
prosecutors presented evidence that someone in the @entity35 home searched online for how to make chloroform , but @entity6 's mother , @entity102 , claimed on the witness stand that she had done the searches by mistake while looking up information about chlorophyll			1
development : a local tv station claims the new evidence could have resulted in @entity6 's conviction many jurors apparently went into hiding amid public outrage over the verdict and refused to comment but two have said prosecutors could n't conclusively prove how @entity6 died			2
prosecutors @entity117 and @entity119 did n't respond to emails from @entity121 on sunday			0
but @entity119 told @entity42 that ' it 's just a shame we did n't have it			0
this certainly would have put the accidental death claim in serious question '			0
@entity31 did n't respond to phone or email messages on sunday but told @entity42 that he expected prosecutors to bring up the search at trial			0
' when they did n't , we were kind of shocked , ' @entity31 , who no longer represents @entity35 , told the station			0
her attorney , @entity137 , who was also on the trial team , did n't return an email on sunday , and his office answering service refused to take a phone message			0
the sheriff 's office did n't consult the @entity146 or @entity147 for help searching the computer in the @entity35 case , a mistake investigators have learned from , @entity143 said			0
prosecutors had argued that @entity35 suffocated @entity6 with chloroform , then taped her mouth shut			2
her partially - decomposed body was found in a garbage bag dumped in a swamp on december 11 , 2008 - nearly six months after she was left seen alive by her grandparents			1
horrific : prosecutors believe that @entity6 's killer suffocated her with the anesthetic chloroform and then taped her mouth shut that same day , @entity27 visited her parents at their home in @entity84 , @entity25 , along with her daughter @entity6			1
it was the last time the child was seen alive			0
the next day , @entity6 went missing and @entity35 and @entity102 repeatedly asked @entity27 what had happened to their granddaughter			1
prosecutors tried to convict @entity6 using key pieces of information that they claimed proved her guilt in the murder			2
it was alleged that that @entity35 used chloroform to knock out her daughter @entity6			2
while the girl was unconscious , prosecutors said @entity35 put duct tape over @entity6 ’s mouth , which suffocated the toddler			2
the word ‘ chloroform ’ was searched on a computer in the @entity35 home 84 times as well as ' neck breaking ' and ' household weapons ' before the girl 's disappearance			2
in addition , a police k - 9 agent testified that his cadaver dog , @entity191 , detected human decomposition in the trunk of @entity35 ’s car			0
another agent testified that her dog , bones , had detected human decomposition in the backyard of the @entity201 home			0
when she was first questioned by police , @entity35 insisted that she had not seen @entity6 since she left her in the care of a babysitter , whom she identified as @entity205 , a woman who police could never link to the murder			2
however , a woman with that name was not involved with @entity6 ’s disappearance			2
that woman is now suing @entity35 for defamation , claiming she was fired from her job , kicked out of her apartment and subjected to death threats as a result of her questioning			0
finally , on july 15 , 2008 - 31 days after that visit - @entity6 called police to report that @entity6 had vanished			1
on march 17 , 2008 - months before the toddler 's disappearance - chloroform , neck - breaking , head injuries , ruptured spleen , chest trauma , inhalation and internal bleeding , were all searched in either @entity8 on @entity226 on the family computer			1
the fragmented search results were recovered from the hard drive , even though the computer 's internet browsing history had been deleted			0
the search for ' chloroform , ' typed in 84 times before @entity6 's disappearance , became a key piece of the prosecution 's case - brought up during opening statements and several times during the trial			1
@entity6 claimed she was the one who had searched for the word , saying that she thought her dog was being poisoned by eating bamboo leaves from the garden			1
she said the initial search was for ' chlorophyll , ' @entity102 said she later found herself searching for information on the toxic chemical			0
prosecutors later proved the @entity102 was at work when most of the searches took place			0
chloroform vapors can knock even healthy adults unconscious when they are inhaled			0
in large doses , the gas can be fatal			0
' there is something wrong			0
i found my daughter 's car today and it smells like there 's been a dead body in the damn car , ' she told a 911 operator			2
it is unknown how detectives missed that key piece of evidence			0
other searches on the @entity273 ' computer had been introduced into evidence			0
@entity31 rejected the report as an example of ' the standard @entity278 spin			0
' he told the @entity279 that any revelations coming from the @entity42 report are ' 100 per cent false			0
' concerned : @entity35 and @entity6 last saw their granddaughter on june 16 , 2008 - the day she came to visit with @entity27 tragedy : @entity6 's body was found in december 2008 - about six months after she was last seen			1
her mother @entity27 was the prime suspect in her death			2

term was searched on @entity290 on june 16 , 2008 when @entity27 visited her parents with @entity6
@entity6 disappeared that day - her body was found six months later
