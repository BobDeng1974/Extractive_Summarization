while @entity3 offers touch id to use your fingerprint to unlock a handset , @entity2 has now released an update to its @entity10 software allowing owners to unlock their phone with their voice			1

@entity2 has released an update to its @entity10 software allowing owners to unlock their phone with their voice ' we 've heard from multiple users that the fully formed feature is rolling out , ' said @entity10 police			1
' tapping the option under smart lock will take users to the @entity2 app 's settings			2
' a warning advises that trusted voice unlocking is less secure than other options , but just a couple taps and you 'll be able to unlock and execute commands on your secured device by simply uttering ' ok @entity2			1
'' however , even @entity2 admits the feature is not as secure as other password options			2
the popup when you enable ' @entity40 ' warns that the feature is not as secure as a traditional lock screen and that ' someone with a similar voice could unlock your device			1
' @entity2 also offers an alternative way to unlock an @entity10 phone - and it involves using your face			1
the @entity50 feature was originally introduced in 2011 as part of @entity10 4.0 , also known as @entity52 , but despite this , it is still a relatively unknown tool			1
it can recognise a person 's face and recent updates mean it can even establish whether or not the face being shown to the camera is real , or is a photograph			0
the voice unlock feature has not been officially announced by @entity2 , but has begun to appear on some @entity10 handsets to set up @entity50 , people with @entity10 phones running @entity52 or higher can go to @entity68 , @entity69 , click on @entity70 and select @entity50			1
the set - up wizard will then ask the user to take a photo of their face , using the device 's front - facing camera			0
it will also advise if the lighting or positioning is n't clear enough			0
once a photograph is taken it is stored in an encrypted file and each time a person wants to unlock their phone with their face , the @entity10 system will cross-reference the image with this original photograph			2

when @entity2 launched face unlock it was criticised by security experts because it could be bypassed by holding static photos up to the phone or tablet 's camera			2
in the update to @entity127 in july 2012 , @entity2 added a ' liveness ' check in an attempt to prevent these static images being used to gain access to devices			0
this meant a user would have to blink while using @entity50 to prove they were alive			0
@entity2 already lets its users enable two - step verification for their online accounts , and offers face unlock on @entity10			1
with @entity50 , pictured , @entity10 users can use their face to unlock their smartphone or tablet , in place of a pin or a pattern a number of @entity146 users reported problems with the @entity50 feature when the phone launched earlier this year , but @entity2 has said that these bugs should be fixed with the introduction of @entity10 4.4 @entity152			1
the expression would then be scanned and compared to a previously captured photo to confirm the user 's identity			0
the patent explains there would be a small margin of error but the user 's expression would have to match the original photo as closely as possible			0
it is likely this feature may appear in future versions of the @entity10 operating system , although a precise release date has n't been announced .			0
