a @entity1 journalist working undercover in a @entity3 sweatshop has revealed details of the back - breaking work and appalling conditions children as young as nine have to deal with			1
@entity8 traveled to @entity9 to experience firsthand conditions in garment factories that mass produce products for the @entity14			1
her account in the @entity16 sheds light on the long hours , poor pay and dangerous and unsanitary conditions factory workers are subjected to			1
heart breaking : nine - year - old factory worker @entity22 was in charge of training undercover reporter @entity8 investigation : @entity8 reporter @entity8 worked undercover at a @entity9 garment factory most shocking of all was how a nine - year - old girl named @entity22 , forced into work to help raise money for her family , was put in charge of training ms @entity8			1
' the first time i saw @entity22 , which was also my first day at work at a sweatshop , she was having a good day despite the wretched heat			2
she sat cross-legged on the concrete floor , a tiny , frail figure among piles of collars , cuffs and other parts of unstitched shirts , ' ms @entity8 wrote in the @entity16			1
the reporter 's investigation came in the wake of the @entity48 factory collapse in april , when more than 1,100 workers died			1
after what became known as the worst garment factory disaster in the world , there was intense scrutiny of working conditions and child labor			1
but the larger factories also brought in improved security and screening programs , making it harder for undercover investigators to gain access			2
ms @entity8 was able to find work only after a @entity3 driver told a small factory owner , named @entity66 , that she was related to his wife and had moved to the city for work			1
child labor : @entity71 , 13 , was one of the youngsters working 12 - hour days at the factory after being offered a trial , ms @entity8 found herself arriving at the sweatshop on an oppressively hot day in august			1
' the factory was n’t big : about two dozen sewing machines lined the walls of the windowless room , about half the size of a basketball court			1
two cutting machines sat in a corner			2
the sewing machines had little benches for the operators , and almost all had piles of colorful fabric by the side			2
three ceiling fans , covered with layers of dirt , hummed quietly , ' she wrote			0
a quick tour of the building revealed no fire extinguishers , only one exit - the front door - and little more than a hole in the ground , down a rat - infested hall , for the toilet			0
staff worked from 9am to 9pm with only a lunch break			0
the girls tasked with snipping off threads from the men 's shirts being made , had to sit cross legged in the middle of the floor			0
ms @entity8 joined the girls on the floor and , under @entity22 's direction , was taught how to snip away loose threads without marking the clothes			1
' it was back - breaking , it was finger - numbing			0
it was particularly rage - inducing , ' she said			0
' not because it was painfully hard work but because children like @entity22 hunched over hour after hour , squinted at the threads , cleaned one collar after another , one cuff after another , one arm piece after another until the piles were depleted			2
' like many young factory workers , @entity22 was taken out of school when the family ran into hardship			1
with her mother pregnant and unable to work , the family needed @entity22 to help boost the income			0
disaster : more than 1,100 factory workers were killed when a @entity9 sweatshop collapsed in april focus : working conditions came under the spotlight after the @entity48 building collapsed her father found her the job at @entity66 's factory because the girl 's aunt also worked there and would be able to look after her			2
overnight , @entity22 went from being a carefree schoolgirl to a factory worker , toiling for 12 hours a day			2
' it works for everyone , ' @entity149 , of the @entity9 - based @entity150 ’ @entity151 , said			0
' factory owners get workers who are not demanding ... while the parents get to keep what the kids earn because the kids do n’t know any better			2
' @entity22 's wages are paid to her father and she is allowed to buy herself a glittery hair clip each month and an occasional ice - cream			0
' it is not as if @entity22 ’s parents do n’t care for her , they simply had no choice , ' ms @entity8 wrote			1
despite the long hours and aches caused from sitting hunched over for hours at a time , @entity22 was always smiling and her only complaint was that she was yelled at if she chatted too much or hummed too loudly			0
workers like @entity22 are paid about $ 25 a month			0
they are allowed half a day off every friday and do not get holidays or paid sick leave			0
in a country with widespread poverty however , such jobs are valued and @entity22 had ambitions to move up the factory chain to become a better - paid sewing operator			1
' when i become a sewing operator , i will make very good shirts , ' she said			0
' no one will yell at me			0
' the lifestyle is so common in @entity3 that @entity22 and another of the girls , 13 - year - old @entity71 think nothing of ending their education early			0
even at their young ages they knew how the extra money could help and talked of how their families had been able to buy furniture and goats			2
ambition : becoming a sewing operator like @entity195 , above , is the dream of girls like @entity22 @entity71 also hoped she could earn enough to avoid being married off to a stranger			0
' by all accounts , working women are changing their lives , their families ’ lives , ' ms @entity8 said			1
' there is more food in homes , and cleaner clothes			0
there is electricity , even if it ’s one bulb , and there are toilets ... but it has come at a price			0
' for children like @entity22 , the factory has become their life			1
ms @entity8 may have been able to return to her comfortable home and office job , but the knowledge that thousands of girls remain trapped in such back - breaking work has stayed with her .			1
