by @entity0 published : 10:43 est , 10 october 2012 updated : 12:29 est , 10 october 2012 high court : @entity2 , pictured , is fighting for his job after joking with a child molester that he wanted to rape a colleague a policeman sent a sordid ' joke ' to a paedophile about raping a colleague and provided the pervert with a ' shoulder to cry on ' when he was on bail for sexual abuse , a court was told			1
as well as befriending sex offender @entity15 , @entity2 also used a police computer to run checks on him - and is now fighting to save his career at the @entity19			1
@entity21 chief constable , @entity20 , is adamant that mr @entity2 must be sacked and is challenging the ' bizarre ' and ' irrational ' decision of the @entity23 ( @entity23 ) to order his reinstatement on the force and issue him with a final warning			2
@entity27 , for mr @entity20 , told the court mr @entity2 had used his police email address to send @entity15 a series of explicitly - worded messages including one which read : ' just waitin for the women to come and open up			1
i might rape her as theres noone else here ( sic )			0
' @entity15 , who mr @entity2 knew through a shared interest in cricket and angling , admitted sexual activity with a 14 - year - old girl at @entity44 in october 2009 and was jailed for a year			2
mr @entity47 , in his written submissions to the court , conceded there was no evidence mr @entity2 knew about @entity15 ’s crime when he sent the ' rape joke ' email , but added that he had ' continued to associate ' with his friend even after he was charged and on bail			1
he had also committed flagrant breaches of the @entity56 by repeatedly accessing the ' @entity58 ' police intelligence computer to look up details about @entity15 , the @entity27 told the court			2
mr @entity20 ’s predecessor as chief constable , @entity60 , had ordered mr @entity2 ’s dismissal from the force but , in may last year , he was overruled by the @entity23 which directed he be reinstated and given a final warning			0
challenging that ruling , mr @entity47 argued : ' no reasonable tribunal could have imposed a sanction other than dismissal for an officer found gulity of such a cumulative litany of allegations which undermined public confidence in the reputation of the police service '			0
describing parts of the @entity23 ’s reasoning as ' bizarre ' , the @entity76 asked : ' how would a @entity21 victim of rape react to learning that a sexual offences trained officer " joked " about raping a woman himself ? would that encourage her to come forward to @entity86 ? ' he added : ' how would a man on the @entity90 omnibus view the fact that one of his local officers , on duty , is sending foul emails to an inappropriate associate , joking about home - made and barely legal pornography and masturbation			1
claim : @entity86 want him sacked from his job because of @entity2 's behaviour in the job , the @entity19 , pictured , heard ' how would a local citizen respond to the knowledge that one of his local officers is lending a shoulder to cry on to a child sex offender on bail ? ' what would the 14 - year - old victim of @entity15 , or her parents , or her friends , or other victims of sexual assault think of the police if they discovered that mr @entity2 accessed intelligence about @entity15 ’s offence not for the proper policing purpose of detecting crime , but to check up on his friend ? ' @entity122 , for mr @entity2 , conceded that his misconduct had been serious and that the court would be ' wholly unimpressed ' by his behaviour			1
however , he had expressed remorse and the case did not concern his ' honesty and integrity '			0
urging mr justice @entity131 to find that ' a lesser outcome than dismissal ' was acceptable , the barrister said the chief constable ' does not have a monopoly of wisdom ' on what is and is not behaviour justifying the termination of a police officer ’s career			0
emphasising that @entity142 had not accessed police intelligence ' at the direction of @entity15 ' , the barrister argued that the overall effect of the allegations he faced was ' misleading and prejudicial ' and that dismissal should not be ' the default sanction ' in such cases			2
the language used by the @entity23 in condemning @entity150 ' could hardly be stronger ' and it had clearly not underestimated the seriousness of his misconduct , he added			0
mr justice @entity131 has now reserved his judgment on the chief constable ’s appeal until a later date .			0

@entity150 @entity2 wrote to @entity15 : ' just waitin for the women to come and open up . i might rape her as theres noone else here ( sic ) '
he also used the police computer search *system* to run checks on @entity15 and was a ' shoulder to cry on ' when he was out on bail
@entity21 @entity86 want to overturn a ruling allowing him to keep his job
