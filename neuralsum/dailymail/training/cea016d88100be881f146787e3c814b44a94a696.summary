by @entity0 published : 11:49 est , 18 march 2014 updated : 15:16 est , 18 march 2014 convert : @entity2 , 22 , who refused to remove her niqab full face veil in court has been jailed for a further six months a muslim convert who refused to remove her niqab in court was jailed for six months today after she terrorised a mosque security guard because he allowed non-muslim women inside without veils			1
last week @entity2 , 22 , was sentenced to 20 months at the @entity12 for making three videos glorifying the murder of fusilier @entity15 while her husband @entity16 , 23 , was jailed for five years and four months			1
however , today she was sentenced to a further six months after admitting to threatening and intimidating @entity17 at @entity18 in north @entity19			1
@entity20 had initially denied a single charge of intimidating a witness but , in a bizarre twist , changed her plea to guilty in january after the jury failed to reach a verdict against her and her brother @entity20 , 32			1
she had tried to stop mr @entity17 from testifying against @entity16 , who had assaulted him			1
@entity16 had angrily confronted mr @entity17 after they took offence when he let three @entity31 women tourists tour the mosque without wearing headscarves on june 10 last year			1
she later returned to mr @entity17 ’s office and confronted him about letting non-muslims into the mosque asking him ' why are you inviting naked women in the mosque			1
' @entity20 then ran off and her husband attacked mr @entity17 who then reported it to the police			1
two weeks later , on june 23 , @entity20 returned to the mosque in an attempt to stop mr @entity17 from giving evidence			1
she told the frightened security guard : ‘ now i ’ve seen your face you ’re finished - you ’re not safe ’			2
@entity16 was found guilty of assault and harassment at @entity51 ’ court in december 2013			1
mr @entity17 said he was left feeling ' worried ' about another attack because he did not know what @entity20 looked like due to her having her face covered			2
a defence statement previously made to the court said : ' she attended on june 23 to ask him why he was lying			0
row : @entity20 admitted to threatening and intimidating @entity17 at @entity18 in north @entity19 in a row over @entity61 women being allowed inside without wearing veils ' she did not threaten him or do anything to interfere with him being a witness in other proceedings			1
' during her trial @entity20 had to remove her veil for a female police officer who then verified that she was the defendant at the start of every court session			0
during her trial at @entity74 she refused to remove her niqab - which leaves only the eyes on show			0
she claimed her religion prevented her removing the veil in the presence of men but judge @entity82 ruled it was of ‘ cardinal importance ’ that a jury could see her face while she gave evidence			0
in his original ruling @entity88 said that @entity20 could not expect the court to ‘ set aside its established procedure ’ to accommodate a ‘ particular religious practice ’			0
write caption here video nasty : @entity16 was filmed by his wife laughing hysterically as he drove past the scene of the attack near @entity99 last may @entity100 , defending , today told the court that @entity20 , of @entity102 , north @entity19 , has suffered ‘ great intrusion into her life ’ due to ‘ unprecedented media interest ’ for her wearing of the niqab			0
she also said that @entity20 ’s dreams of becoming an @entity110 teacher were now in “ tatters ” and that she wanted to get on with her life being a law abiding citizen			0
but judge @entity82 said the court must show that witness intimidation was not acceptable			0
shocking : in the video clips @entity16 described the day fusilier @entity15 ( pictured ) was murdered as ' brilliant ' he said : ' i have given a great deal of thought to this case			2
mr @entity17 was doing his job			2
obviously there was a difference of opinion but it did not justify the offence committed against him			0
' the judge jailed @entity20 for an extra six months for intimidating mr @entity17 , to run consecutively to her current term of imprisonment , and also handed her a five - year restraining order banning her from contacting mr @entity17 , going within 500 meters of @entity18 and from entering the @entity132			1
. ' your brother said that your husband @entity16 had changed your life considerably for the worse - i ’m sure you do n’t agree with that ' , he said			2
' i have to say i find his evidence compelling and whether you wish me to or not i ’m going to take into account my own belief that this offence was committed by you at least partly under your husband ’s influence			0
' he added : ' it was not a systematic campaign but took place on one occasion and no violence was used but the threats were obviously very real			0
' @entity20 , who refused to stand in court , bowed her head as she received her latest prison sentence			0
last week @entity20 and her husband were jailed at the @entity12 after she filmed @entity16 - a @entity158 extremist with links to one of @entity15 's killers @entity162 - as he glorified the @entity99 killing in a series of @entity165 videos			1
@entity16 was filmed by his veiled wife laughing hysterically as he drove past the scene of the attack near @entity169 last may			0
the couple ridiculed the memorial flowers left by friends , family , and members of the public for @entity15 and @entity16 described the murder as ‘ absolutely brilliant ’ on videos uploaded on to @entity165			2
in the clip shot as the pair drove close to tributes left to @entity15 , @entity20 asked her husband to drive around again as he said : ' these kuffar , they fail to realise that their foreign policy is the reason why this @entity15 is no more ... he got chopped up in @entity99 ...
