by @entity0 published : 05:37 est , 24 january 2013 updated : 20:44 est , 24 january 2013 police were accused of exaggerating falls in crime last night as official figures showed dramatic drops in burglary , car crime and vandalism			1
the national crime survey showed overall crime fell by more than 8 per cent last year to a record low			0
police recorded crime figures showed a similar fall , of 7 per cent			1
strange : the line on this @entity18 graph show the rate of crime according to the @entity21 , and the bar chart shows crimes recorded by police , which is much lower but the @entity25 said police figures may have exaggerated the fall in crime in recent years			1
officials said police were under ‘ informal pressure ’ to meet crime reduction targets and so may have downgraded some crimes so they were not reported			1
this could lead to a burglary being reported as criminal damage or low - level vandalism as anti-social behaviour , they said			0
police recorded 400,000 fewer offences over five years than those reported in @entity21 , a survey of more than 40,000 households seen as more accurate because it is not linked to police figures			1
@entity46 called for an inquiry into whether fewer crimes were being recorded as a result of cuts in police funding			1
but the @entity52 insisted there were other reasons to explain the discrepancy			0
@entity56 , deputy chief constable of @entity57 , said officers may have been ‘ over-zealous ’ in how they recorded crime when new standards were brought in ten years ago			1
he added that more crimes were dealt with informally by neighbourhood policing teams			0
questions : experts have said the police 's recording of crimes may be lower than they should be - as low - level crime may be dropping off the system the @entity21 shows that crime has reached its lowest level since records began in 1981 , despite sharp cuts to police funding			1
in what will come as good news for home secretary @entity77 , the national crime survey found there were 8.9million crimes committed in the year to september 2012 – 820,000 fewer than a year earlier			2
the @entity25 said it expected crime to fall even further in future as yesterday ’s numbers were the start of an ‘ emerging downward trend ’			2
8.9 million incidents of crime , down 8 % * 1.8 million incidents of vandalism , down 14 % 653,000 incidents of burglary , down 11 % 1.1 million vehicle - related thefts , down 11 % 468,000 bicycle thefts , up 2 % 1.4 million household thefts , up 5 % 3.6 million household crimes , down 4 % 551,000 thefts from the person , down 7 % 1 million thefts of personal property , down 8 % 1.9 million incidents of violence , down 12 % 1.8 million personal theft , down 6 % * according to the @entity21 it showed that burglary was down by 11 per cent , including an 18 per cent fall in break - ins in which the intruder entered the property			1
theft from vehicles was down 11 per cent			0
overall , violent crime was down by 12 per cent – with the number having halved since 1995			0
the murder rate fell 10 per cent to 551 , its lowest since 1978			0
statisticians said the fall in house and car break - ins was linked to improvements in home security and car locking and alarm systems			0
but so - called pickpocket thefts rose 6 per cent , due to thieves targeting expensive ipods and @entity126 to sell on overseas			2
crime prevention minister @entity127 said : ‘ police reform is working			0
we have swept away central targets , reduced bureaucracy and these figures show forces are rising to the challenge of doing more with less			2
’ forces are no longer judged on a @entity46 target for bringing offenders to justice which critics said encouraged the police to solve easy crimes to improve their clear - up rate			2
@entity144 , of the @entity25 , said : ‘ [ with ] some lower level crimes there is a judgment call to be made as to whether the incident attended to by the officer is actually a crime in law or a low level incident that would not get into the crime figures			1
‘ it ’s possible in an era of targets to cut crime and pressure on officers to see a reduction in crime that their judgment will sway more to including that in the lower level category			0

there were 8.9m crimes in 12 *months* to september - the lowest ever according to the official @entity21
nearly all crime is down apart from street theft , as criminals are targeting *smartphones* , ipods , @entity174 and bikes
but separate crime figures recorded by police show an even *bigger* drop , which experts say shows that have ' overstated ' improvement
targets ' may have swayed officers into downgrading *marginal* incidents ' , @entity25 says
