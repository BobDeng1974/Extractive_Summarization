a simple blood test has been developed to signal when a common treatment for prostate cancer has stopped working			1
@entity4 scientists hope the new test might vastly improve outcomes for men with advanced cancer by making treatment more effective			1
they developed the test after discovering that glucocorticoids – steroid drugs given to 90 per cent of prostate cancer patients – can actually accelerate the growth of tumours after a few months of use			1
a blood test developed by experts at the @entity18 can tell doctors when a common treatment for prostate cancer has stopped being effective although the treatment is initially very effective at battling the tumour , after a certain period - which varies patient to patient - it stops working , and then even starts encouraging the cancer to grow			1
in one in five patients the steroid eventually drives an aggressive mutation which leads to accelerated tumour growth , the research suggests			1
the startling discovery , made by specialists at the @entity18 in @entity35 , could save countless lives			1
the new blood test can precisely tell doctors when the treatment has stopped becoming effective and allow them to stop using it before it puts a patient at risk			1
prostate cancer affects 42,000 people every year in the @entity4			1
it is the most common cancer in men , accounting for a quarter of all male cancers			0
twenty per cent of patients die within five years of receiving a prostate cancer diagnosis			1
study leader dr @entity51 , whose work was published last night ( @entity53 ) in the journal @entity55 , said : ‘ glucocorticoids are initially effective , they are great treatments which we have been using for more than a decade now			2
‘ they make people feel better and their tumours shrink			0
‘ but in time - it could be a couple of years or less , depending on the patient - the cancer manages to adapt and start growing again			0
prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men in the @entity4 , with over 40,000 new cases diagnosed every year			1
prostate cancer usually develops slowly , so there may be no signs you have it for many years			2
symptoms often only become apparent when your prostate is large enough to affect the urethra ( the tube that carries urine from the bladder to the penis )			0
when this happens , you may notice things like an increased need to urinate , straining while urinating and a feeling your bladder has not fully emptied			0
however , these signs do not mean you have prostate cancer			2
it is more likely they are caused by something else , such as benign prostatic hyperplasia ( also known as @entity88 or prostate enlargement )			0
source : @entity91 ‘ in one in five people the treatment might start driving the disease , activating harmful mutations			0
‘ in the future , we hope to routinely monitor genetic mutations in patients with advanced disease using just a blood test – enabling us to stop treatments when they become disease drivers and select the next best treatment option			2
’ the study , based on complex genetic analysis of biopsies and blood samples from 16 patients with advanced prostate cancer , shows that glucocorticoids – which are usually given alongside hormone therapy - can in some cases increase the population of cancer cells in a tumour			1
once the body has adapted to the drug , the cancer is driven into a more aggressive form , and starts mutating and accelerating its growth			0
but the researchers , who worked with doctors at the @entity126 cancer hospital @entity35 and the @entity127 in @entity128 , found that regular blood tests - or ‘ liquid biopsies ’ - could track minute changes in the dna of the tumour			0
it means they can act as soon as the cancer starts becoming resistant to the treatment , and withdraw it before it starts mutating into an aggressive form			0
doctors are already using the blood test on all prostate patients at the @entity126 , and hope that with more positive results it could be rolled out to all hospitals			2
dr @entity51 said : ‘ we need to confirm these findings in larger numbers of patients but using these types of blood tests could allow true personalisation of treatment for prostate cancer patients , based on the cancer mutations we detect			1
’ the @entity156 @entity4 and @entity157 charities , which funded the research , last night welcomed the findings			0
but they warned that patients treated with glucocorticoids should continue taking their treatment - and not abandon it on account of the discovery			0
prostate cancer affects 42,000 people every year in the @entity4			1
it is the most common cancer in men , accounting for a quarter of all male cancers dr @entity172 , deputy director of research at @entity174 , said : ‘ this research is important as it shows that there might be a new way to monitor how a man ’s cancer is changing during treatment and that could help us to pinpoint the stage at which some drugs stop being effective			0
‘ in the future this could arm doctors with the knowledge they need to ensure that no time is wasted between a drug that stops working for a man and him moving on to another effective treatment			2
’ @entity192 , science information manager at @entity157 , added : ‘ it ’s vital to understand the genetic twists and turns that offer tumour cells an escape route to become resistant to treatment			0

glucocorticoids are steroids given to 90 per cent of prostate cancer patients
treatment is initially effective but stops working after a certain period
in one fifth of patients steroids actually *trigger* aggressive tumour growth
blood test developed to signal when treatment has stopped working
experts said the discovery could save ' countless lives
prostate cancer affects 42,000 people every year in the @entity4
