an unlikely alliance of left - leaning human rights activists , right - wing conservatives and church leaders has been forged to try and save the life of a mentally ill convicted killer slated for execution this week			1

@entity13 , 56 , is set to be put to death for the 1992 shooting deaths of his estranged wife 's parents at their home in @entity19 in the @entity20			1
condemnded : @entity20 death row inmate @entity8 's execution is set for december 3 but his attorneys want the death date withdrawn or at least delayed to allow for a new round of psychological testing to determine if he 's competent to be executed there was ' no doubt ' @entity13 was severely mentally ill ' before , during and after the crime for which he has been sentenced to death , ' attorneys @entity28 and @entity30 told the justices			1
' and mr. @entity13 's mental state has further deteriorated since his last evaluation in 2007			2
' the long list of those who are opposed to mr @entity13 's execution includes more than 50 @entity42 leaders , seven @entity44 bishops , 10 @entity20 state lawmakers and former libertarian presidential candidate and @entity47 congressman @entity47 , reported @entity48			1
last month , @entity47 wrote a letter to @entity20 governor @entity50 asking him to grant @entity13 clemency			0
@entity50 's gubernatorial predecessor @entity52 , a @entity52 , has gone on record calling @entity13 's capital murder trial a ' sham			1
' nearly 100,000 people from all walks of life have signed an online petition on @entity59 asking to spare @entity13 's life			2
even his ex-wife , @entity61 , whose parents the inmate shot dead in front of her in 1992 , has declared that she believes he is too mentally ill to be put to death			1
@entity8 's case has something for everyone : libertarians oppose the death penalty because they do not trust the government ; fiscal conservatives believe that executing an inmate costs more than imprisoning him for life , and religious conservatives reject capital punishment as a pro-life matter			1
@entity78 , a former @entity80 abortion clinic staffer - turned anti-abortion activist , wrote in a recent @entity82 op - ed that opposing @entity13 's execution is consistent with the key principles of the pro-life movement			1

they were held hostage until he surrendered after a lengthy standoff with police			0
he blamed it all on ' @entity127 , ' one of his multiple personalities			0
justices in 2002 prohibited the execution of people who are mentally impaired , deciding it violated the @entity135 's ban on cruel and unusual punishment			2
but they have allowed capital punishment for mentally ill prisoners as long as the inmate has a factual and rational understanding of why he 's being put to death			1
the ' rational understanding ' provision was added by the @entity9 in a 2007 ruling on an appeal from @entity13			2
records indicate his case has gone to the @entity9 at least five times since his 1995 conviction and sentence			0
too sick to die : @entity13 's lawyers say he is too severely mentally ill to be executed ' imposition of the death penalty on people with severe mental illness , as with people with intellectual disability , does not serve the two goals of deterrence and retribution because of their reduced moral culpability , ' @entity13 's lawyers argued to the high court monday			1
another appeal for @entity13 pending before a federal appeals court seeks an execution delay for additional competency evaluations			1
while his medical records contain indications of mental illness , they ' strongly indicate rational awareness of his impending execution and the reason for it , ' @entity166 , an assistant @entity20 attorney general , told the 5th @entity174			0
' @entity13 's mental status has at best been severely exaggerated by his counsel , ' she said			2

at his trial , @entity13 ' wore the garish costume of a dime - store cowboy as he represented himself ' and ' engaged in bizarre , incoherent and frightening behavior , ' his attorneys said			1
his trial judge ruled he could be his own lawyer and appointed a standby attorney whom @entity13 never consulted except to call as a witness during the trial 's punishment phase			2
@entity13 , pictured left as a boy , had moved to @entity20 with his parents in the 1970s			0
the one - time @entity195 ( right ) worked as a ranch hand â€” his occupation on prison documents is listed as blacksmith @entity201 thumping : @entity13 already had a history of mental problems before the shooting , recording 14 hospital stays over 11 years			0
he 's seen here with his brother delusional ? attorneys contend @entity13 is so delusional that he ca n't understand why he was convicted and condemned			0
here , he 's pictured with his mother and father at one point , the defendant even tried to subpoena @entity213 and assassinated president @entity214 as witnesses			1
he insisted only an insane person could prove insanity			0
i just wanted to see my wife , ' @entity13 , in a taped statement played at his capital murder trial , explained why he went to the home armed with a rifle , a sawed - off shotgun and three knives and dressed in camouflage clothing			1
' i put on my combat stuff so if i was cornered , i wanted to have my equipment			0
it was like i was n't even in control , like someone else was pushing me			0
