you would never know by looking at the lively and cheeky toddler - now 16 - months - old - that he was so close to death just seven months ago			1
but when @entity3 was nine - months - old he swallowed a button battery in the family 's inner - west @entity6 home in april which had attached to his oesophagus for six days before finally being discovered on the third visit to the hospital			1
the little tacker had eroded an astounding one third of his oesophagus and had to spend eight days in an induced coma and a further six weeks being tube fed through his nose when he made a miraculous full recovery			1
@entity3 was put into an induced coma for eight days with no certainty of full recovery the nine - month - old swallowed a button battery which was discovered six days later on the third hospital visit you would never know by looking at the lively and cheeky toddler - now 16 - months - old - that was he so close to death just seven months ago as soon as the x-ray revealed the round foreign object , his mother , @entity30 , immediately realised what had happened			1
her husband , @entity32 , had changed his bike helmet battery light and their eldest son , @entity35 , 3 , had climbed on to the bench and must have knocked it off onto the floor			0
' @entity3 is a little vacuum cleaner , ' his mother @entity41 quipped who was unaware of what had happened at the time			2
' he started crying out of the blue and was really distressed for the rest of the night , ' she said			0
' he was also vomiting but he was already unwell that week with a fever so i just thought it was part of that			0
' @entity41 ( pictured ) believes her son 's fighting spirit helped with his full recovery @entity3 was tube fed for three weeks in the ward and another three weeks when he went home it was n't until @entity3 's breathing changed that his parents took him to hospital with staff treating him for croup on the first two visits			1
but when the little fella did n't improve , @entity41 went back to the hospital and requested an x-ray and @entity3 was rushed into emergency surgery within 25 minutes			2
' i still had no idea what was in store or how severe it was , ' she recalls			0
' it was a crazy time - i still ca n't believe we made it through			2
' being so young , @entity3 needed to be sedated so he could remain still in order to heal and was therefore put into an induced coma for eight days			1
he then spent another three days in intensive care and a further three weeks in a ward before going home where he was tube fed at home for another three weeks			1
@entity83 ’s ear , nose and throat specialist , @entity86 , told @entity41 that he had no idea of the prognosis as it ' was the worst damage he had seen			1
' a third of @entity3 's oesophagus had eroded but it completely healed about two months later his mother described @entity3 as a ' robust little guy ' who was a ' loving , friendly and outgoing character ' however , six weeks after leaving hospital , his follow - up procedure showed that his oesophagus had completely healed			1
' the staff were amazed he survived six days with the battery inside him - one more day and it may have been different , ' she said			1
@entity41 believed that her son 's character had a lot to do with the incredible recovery			2
' he 's a really robust little guy - nine out of 10 kids probably would have died but he has a real fight about him , ' she said			0
' he was jumping up and down on the bed 10 minutes before going into surgery			0
' she said she still finds it hard to believe that such a small object could have been lethal			0
' i had no idea it was such a hazard , ' she said			0
' if it was a coin it would have obstructed and he would have choked - or it would have passed through - but because of the charge of the battery it attached itself to the oesophagus and started to erode			2
' ' it 's good to spread the word because i did n't know such a tiny shiny thing could be such a danger			0
' @entity41 still ca n't believe her family made it through the trauma			0
