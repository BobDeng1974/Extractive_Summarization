we 've seen @entity1 swallow @entity2 and @entity6 chemist 's @entity4 bid for @entity7			0
now another @entity9 icon has fallen prey to a giant @entity6 corporation – after the @entity11 was renamed the @entity12 @entity11			1
the tourist attraction , which has become a symbol of the @entity11 skyline , now glows red at night rather than blue to mark the landmark 's sponsorship deal with the fizzy drinks firm			1
visitors were shocked to see that every pod of the eye is now branded with its own @entity12 logo			2
staff have been kitted out in red @entity12 uniforms – including @entity12 beanie hats for security workers – and the ticket office has been plastered with @entity12 posters			1
the move left plenty of people seeing red yesterday , with the @entity11 's owners accused of selling out , and health campaigners criticising the decision to promote such a sugary drink			1
one can of @entity12 contains nine teaspoons of sugar			2
the maximum recommended daily intake of sugar is 30 teaspoons for men , 22.5 teaspoons for women and 21 for children			0
@entity57 , from the @entity56 , told @entity58 : ' it 's totally inappropriate for a major family attraction to be sponsored by a sugary drinks company			2
' it sends completely the wrong message , not just here in @entity11 , but right across the globe			2
soft drinks are the largest source of sugar in children and teenagers ' diets , associated with weight gain and obesity , diabetes , heart disease and poor dental health			0
' volunteers from the @entity56 were at the @entity11 yesterday handing out 500 toothbrushes to families visiting the attraction the campaigners say that it is inappropriate that @entity12 , a sugary drinks firm should be sponsoring the @entity11 attraction yesterday campaigners handed out 500 toothbrushes at the eye to symbolise the 500 children who are admitted to hospital because of tooth decay every week			1
the @entity11 was sponsored by @entity89 for the eight years after its launch in 2000			0
the airline was one of the original joint owners until the attraction was bought by @entity95 in 2005			0
yesterday @entity95 said customers were able to make their own minds up about what to include in their diets			0
but dr @entity100 , vice-president at the @entity101 , said : ' @entity12 is the flagship for sugar marketing and therefore the flagship for rotten teeth and @entity106 're taking over a high - visibility attraction and a major icon of the @entity11 landscape			1
' he added : ' what next , @entity110 sponsored by @entity12 ? there needs to be a much bigger public debate about advertising control before commercial corporate interests infiltrate every aspect of the public landscape			0

@entity11 has been *rebranded* after signing *partnership* with @entity12
the attraction , which *reopened* yesterday now shines red **due** to the deal
the pods have the drink 's branding inside as do the staff uniforms
critics have spoken of their concern of the company sponsoring the eye
campaigners handed out 500 toothbrushes to families at the attraction
they say this represents the number of children hospitalised every week **due** to tooth decay
