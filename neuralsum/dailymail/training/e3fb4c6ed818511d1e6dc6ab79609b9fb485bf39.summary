in three months @entity0 are off again , this time in the @entity2 qualifiers			1
some familiar faces will disappear , and some younger names will emerge in the squad			0
as the post-mortem into @entity0 ’s dismal performance in @entity9 continues , who will be in and who will be out for the first qualifier against @entity12 in september ? @entity13 the 27 - year - old goalkeeper has been unnecessarily overworked because of the deficiencies in front of him			1
continues to be @entity0 ’s best option			2
also belts out the national anthem to set a great example to the others			0
verdict : in beaten : @entity13 could do nothing about @entity25 's late winner against @entity0 @entity26 the @entity28 defender bristles at suggestions he is a weak link but the fact remains he would not have played had @entity32 been fit			1
part of the 2010 shambles and , at the age of 29 , can not be regarded as an option for the next @entity37			0
verdict : out out of form : right - back @entity26 assisted the goal , but was suspect defensively in both games @entity43 poor old @entity44			1
@entity45 all that time behind @entity46 and when he gets his chance is made to look anything but solid			0
with @entity50 loitering in the background , the 29 - year - old @entity49 left back will be coming under increasing pressure and could find himself back in the understudy role			2
verdict : in @entity54 : @entity43 struggled against @entity55 and never delivered the set piece quality he is renowned for @entity57 ( c ) the combined weight of @entity28 ’s title expectations and @entity0 ’s @entity37 hopes turned out to be too heavy for the skipper			1
he has looked mentally and physically exhausted			0
the slip against @entity63 and the giveaway header against @entity65 are sad memories for the 33 - year - old , who will surely call it a day after this			1
verdict : out end of days ? at 34 , chances are @entity57 's @entity0 career could be coming to a close @entity74 had a wonderful season alongside @entity76 ( remember him ? ) and is likely to be the senior central defender going forward despite being bettered by @entity78 and @entity25			1
needs to form a strong partnership with one of the young guns			0
at 28 , he has another four - year cycle in him			2
verdict : in battler : @entity74 was tussing with @entity25 all night aganst @entity65 @entity85 fronted up after the defeat against @entity65 and a wonderful servant to @entity49 but the time may have come for the central defender			1
@entity85 is 31 and was made to look it against world - class opposition			0
@entity92 and @entity93 are waiting in the wings			0
verdict : out caught out : @entity85 looked out of his depth at times , and should have done better for both goals @entity98 when fit there is none better than the @entity102 star			0
he can occupy a holding role , a roving role , and a scoring role			0
@entity98 ’s future will be defined by whether he can steer clear of the treatment table			0
no longer regarded as the answer to all @entity0 ’s midfield problems thanks to the talent on offer			2
verdict : in lacking impact : @entity98 struggled in a short cameo against @entity55 , and remained on the bench throughout against @entity65 @entity116 the view from the bench must have been a frustrating one for @entity116 , whose main role at this @entity37 would be one of morale - booster and leader by example			1
the stalwart is 36 so whatever way you look at it , this is goodbye			0
verdict : out frustrating : @entity116 provides invaluable experience off the pitch , but failed to get on it in either game @entity132 hard to believe that the @entity28 striker has come through such a gruelling domestic campaign			1
looked fresh , acted as if he was delighted to be in @entity9 and won over hearts and minds			0
scored against @entity55 and was @entity0 ’s most threatening player against @entity65			1
verdict : in promising : @entity132 scored the leveller against @entity55 , but struggled to impose himself against @entity65 @entity141 broke his @entity37 duck , provided the cross for @entity132 ’s goal and ran a marathon but also missed too many chances			1
survived the chop against @entity65			2
still @entity0 ’s main striker but what happens next could come down to @entity150 at @entity151 and how he deploys @entity152			2
verdict : in breakthrough : @entity141 finally broke his @entity37 duck against @entity65 , but it could have been so much more @entity155 someone needs to get inside the brain of the @entity151 striker			1
@entity160 ’s belief in him has not been justified and it appears @entity155 ’s insistence he wants a central role is hindering his progress			1
needs to start playing / scoring more regularly for @entity151 to get his place back			2
verdict : out energetic : @entity155 provided plenty of running over the two games , but very little end product @entity170 like @entity171 , has probably paid for @entity151 ’s very disappointing season			1
missed @entity173 through injury and has had niggling problems since			0
at the age of 24 @entity170 can no longer be regarded as a kid and he may just have missed the boat			2
verdict : out action-less : @entity170 did n't see a minute of action during either game , but struggled during the warm - ups @entity183 always difficult for a second - choice goalkeeper			1
the @entity186 player is 31 now and @entity160 may feel it is time to bring in @entity188 and @entity190 - 21 @entity189 for the @entity191 but @entity183 is a steady stand - by			1
verdict : in backup : @entity183 remains a solid alternative to number one @entity13 @entity196 having won over all his critics at @entity28 , the midfielder may have to do it all over again for his country			0
@entity196 worked his socks off in the two games but was shown up by ‘ old man ’ @entity203			0
will continue to be a useful squad member but team spot under pressure			0
verdict : in work ethic : @entity196 put in a decent shift alongside @entity57 in both games @entity210 remember that fresh - faced @entity102 youngster from @entity173 ? injuries have stalled the ox but , at the age of 20 , the winger still has time on his side			1
will be competing with @entity102 team - mate @entity217 , not to mention @entity0 ’s other @entity218			1
it could come down to character as well as class			0
verdict : in cut short : @entity210 's knee injury kept him out of both @entity0 games , it now looks as though he wo n't have the chance to make an impact @entity65 elated as @entity0 sit on the brink @entity171 the @entity151 defender is still only 22 but still has to live up to his potential			1
not had a chance to shine in @entity9 but @entity160 appears not to rate him highly enough to play either at right back or in central defence			2
verdict : in step up : with question marks surrounding the defence , @entity171 must take chance to prove himself @entity235 unfairly pilloried because successive @entity0 managers keep picking him but the wealth of attacking talent coming through means that the @entity240 utility man may well find himself sliding down the pecking order and right out of the international scene			1
verdict : out redundant : with @entity0 not having a lead to defend , @entity235 was n't called upon for his trademark workrate @entity246 it would be such a shame if this turned out to be a cameo tournament for the @entity28 striker but the omens are not good			1
former @entity254 team - mate @entity253 will be knocking on the door and @entity256 might start hitting form for @entity258			2
the 32 - year - old may have had his day			0
verdict : out hard luck : @entity246 deserved better than just a five minute ' @entity262 ' cameo against @entity65 @entity263 ah , that ’s the problem with the kids			2
@entity263 is a truly exciting young talent but as good as he was against @entity55 , the reverse was true against @entity65			1
think back to when he broke into the @entity28 team – @entity269 had to take him out again for a while			0
still only 19 and a big prospect			0
verdict : in light & shade : @entity263 was superb against @entity55 , but anonymous versus @entity65 @entity275 in terms of age @entity275 is not a baby but in terms of experience the 26 - year - old is still wearing international l plates			1
he has not been given enough opportunity to show what he can do in @entity9 and deserves another go on the big stage , especially if continues to shine in the @entity287			0
verdict : in cameos : @entity275 came on in both games for @entity0 , but struggled to assert himself @entity290 there was a palpable sense of excitement when the @entity49 youngster came on as substitute against @entity65			1
he ran at players and looked to do something different			0
it is tough being lauded as the next big thing in @entity0 football but @entity290 looks like he can handle the hype			2
verdict : in experience : @entity290 's time in @entity9 will be invaluable for him going forward @entity305 if @entity183 thought he had a tough gig , spare a thought for @entity305 who was never going to get a game in a month of sundays			0
if @entity183 stays then @entity305 is likely to be the one jettisoned for youth but it could easily go the other way			0
verdict : out third choice : @entity305 was never realistically going to get a game at the @entity37 @entity50 the clamour for the @entity254 teenager continues but whether the 18 - year - old would have done any better against the canny @entity319 and the wily @entity320 is open to debate			0
continues to get better and better on the bench , however , and a big prospect for the future			0
verdict : in successor : despite not getting onto the pitch , @entity50 still seems the likely replacement for @entity46 @entity328 needs @entity319 miracle presuming @entity160 is still coach in september for their opening @entity335 qualifying match away in @entity12 , the first names on his team - sheet are surely @entity13 , @entity132 , @entity74 and @entity141			1
@entity98 taking the @entity57 role is an obvious one too but @entity196 might come under pressure from @entity171			2
having @entity132 , @entity290 and @entity263 as an attacking trio behind @entity141 means no @entity210 , no @entity275			0
@entity339 is n’t it , @entity160 ? possible @entity0 starting line - up v @entity12 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) @entity13 ; @entity32 , @entity342 , @entity74 , @entity50 ; @entity98 , @entity196 ; @entity132 , @entity290 , @entity263 ; @entity141 .			1

@entity0 2 - 1 defeat to @entity65 and @entity346 's win over @entity55 means @entity160 's men are out
@entity57 and @entity116 may be playing their final tournament
three @entity218 must look towards start of @entity335 campaign in september
@entity26 , @entity155 and @entity170 amongst those under pressure for their @entity0 places
