created : 06:45 est , 6 may 2014 a @entity1 nutritionist has been fined after claiming his fitness regime could combat cancer			2
former bodybuilder dr @entity4 , 45 , provided a range of protein shakes and multivitamin drinks , which had ' cured ' two of his clients			1
the health food range could also heal epilepsy , motor neurone disease and multiple sclerosis , according to his website			1
with 300 video testimonials from satisfied clients on the website , @entity15 enjoyed a turnover of £ 70,000 in its first year of business			1
the @entity1 nutritionist told the court he did not know how the word ' cured ' came to appear on his website but today , dr @entity4 was fined £ 1,750 for violating the @entity24			1
the act was designed to protect vulnerable people from unprofessional advice			2
sentencing , district judge @entity28 told @entity29 : ' the written material refers to cancer , with a link to the clinic			2
' it is plainly implied this is someone who treats cancer			2
' any member of the public would believe this is someone who has treated and in two cases cured cancer			2
' i ’m satisfied dr @entity4 was fully involved with everything that ’s on his site and anyone reading this would have no doubt this was an offer of services for those seeking treatment for cancer			1
' i ’m in no doubt those @entity58 testimonials are a major part of the company ’s business in treating cancer and dr @entity4 ’s approach to the @entity24 has been a head in the sand one			1
' district judge @entity28 at @entity29 ruled that dr @entity4 was ' fully involved ' @entity67 capsules sold on dr @entity4 's website were captioned with the testimonial : ' many have said it helps them get rid of cancer			1
' other products included @entity74 , @entity75 and a @entity76 , which were advertised as cures for the life - threatening disease , as well as for asthma , arthritis , and diabetes			0
it was also implied the clinic was involved in the successful treatment of a patient with prostate cancer			0
the business flourished between june 17 and october 2 last year , until the council received a complaint			0
in a bid to distance himself from the website 's content , and video adverts uploaded to @entity58 , dr @entity4 told the court a female employee was responsible			1
' she was meant to stick to specific guidelines and not put on anything about treating cancer or anything like that , ' he said			0
' she was asked not to include her own personal views on there			0
' i know it should not say anything that says we are treating cancer			0
it ’s purely for diet and fitness and exercise and nothing else			0
' acknowledging a video strap line that included the word ' cured ' for a @entity115 cell tumour treatment , dr @entity4 told the court : ' i do n’t know how it got there			1
' he denied uploading the @entity58 content to a page owned by username ‘ @entity120 ’ , and claimed not to know who did			0
' i do n’t write on my website , i have other people update it for me			0
i was checking the website , but obviously not everything that went on there , there ’s three thousand pages , ' he added			0
the judge also ordered dr @entity4 to pay £ 2,500 costs and a £ 120 victim surcharge , telling him : ' you are not accused of quackery , no one is saying you are not a qualified nutritionist			1
' these are reckless offences , not a deliberate attempt by you to exploit the vulnerable			0
