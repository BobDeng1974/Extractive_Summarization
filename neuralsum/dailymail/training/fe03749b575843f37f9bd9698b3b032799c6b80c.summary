by @entity0 , @entity1 published : 04:21 est , 28 september 2012 updated : 19:20 est , 28 september 2012 motor insurance firms are to face a full - scale investigation by competition watchdogs over a rip - off racket costing motorists £ 225million a year and adding £ 10 to every policy			1
the @entity8 ( @entity8 ) today referred the industry to the @entity10 after discovering that drivers had little control over the way in which repairs were carried out and replacement vehicles provided			2
such practices were ramping up premiums			1
@entity19 drivers paying record premiums averaging more than £ 1,000 a year are victims of a ‘ dysfunctional ‘ motor insurance market worth nearly £ 10billion a year			1
counting the cost : motor insurance firms are to be investigated over a rip - off racket which is leaving @entity19 drivers out of pocket costs are being artificially inflated by a ‘ merry go round ' of controversial ‘ referral payments ’ , excessively expensive repair bills , and unnecessarily high replacement car - hire car charges			1
@entity31 have even described some of the practices complained of as bordering on ‘ bribery			1
' the @entity8 says there is clear evidence of the industry - worth an estimated £ 9.4billion in the @entity19 - rigging the market to prevent proper competition to the detriment of @entity19 motorists			1
it has found evidence of premiums paid by drivers being ramped up outrageously through spiralling referral fees			1
money : insurance costs for @entity19 drivers have risen steeply in recent years it added that insurers whose driver customers are to blame for a crash have little control over the way in which repairs are carried out			1
as a result it has decided to refer the issue upwards for investigation by the @entity10 which has powers to take enforcement action and levy hefty fines			0
the @entity8 said there was ‘ no quick fix ’ to the problems identified and that further investigation was needed			0
the commission now has up to two years to report its findings			0
the @entity8 had decided provisionally in may to refer the industry to the @entity10 pending further evidence after concluding : ’ on the basis of the evidence collects , the @entity8 has reasonable grounds to suspect there are features of the private motor insurance market that prevent , restrict , or distort competition			1
’ @entity78 , chief executive of the @entity8 , said : ‘ competition appears not to be working effectively in the private motor insurance market			1
‘ the insurers of at - fault drivers appear to have little control over the bills they must pay , and this may be leading to higher costs for them and ultimately higher premiums for motorists			1
’ in may , the @entity8 said the motor insurance market was ‘ dysfunctional ’ , with signs that insurers of drivers who are ‘ at fault ’ are being taken advantage of by insurers of drivers who are not at fault and by others involved in providing repairs and courtesy cars			1
watchdogs took evidence suggesting that this is inflating the cost of providing replacement vehicles by an average of £ 560 a time , while the cost of repairs was £ 155 more			2
the @entity8 said after crashes , many insurers of not - at - fault drivers , brokers and repairers , refer the drivers to organisations that tend to charge higher rates in exchange for ‘ referral fees ’ of around £ 250 to £ 400 per hire car			1
bills paid by the insurers of the ‘ at - fault ’ drivers can be inflated further because the other drivers are given replacement vehicles for longer than necessary			2
repair bills paid by the insurers of at - fault drivers then pushed up because some insurers receive referral fees and rebates from repairers and suppliers			2
some insurers even have agreements with repairers to charge higher labour rates when repairing the vehicle of the not - at - fault driver			0
such practices boost the revenues of the insurer of the not - at - fault driver as well as pushing up the costs for the insurers of the at - fault driver			2
investigation : the @entity8 will investigate claims the insurance industry is ripping off @entity19 motorists the higher costs are eventually passed on to drivers through higher premiums			1
last year former home secretary @entity150 told @entity31 watchdogs that motorists were being fleeced by £ 2billion a year in unnecessary insurance costs caused by money - grabbing ‘ parasites ’ and ‘ dodgy solicitors ’ engaged in a controversial cash - for - contacts referral - fee ‘ racket ’ which in any other walk of life would be condemned as ‘ bribery			1
’ @entity162 , chairman of the @entity163 ( @entity163 ) said : ' we welcome the @entity8 ’s decision to refer the private motor insurance market to the @entity10			1
‘ it ’s an important and vital step in addressing a complicated sector that is n’t working efficiently or effectively			0
‘ claims : @entity78 ( pictured ) chief executive of the @entity8 said competition does not appear to be working properly in the @entity19 car insurance market she added : ’ there is still much that needs to be done and it is essential that the whole industry continues to work together and with the government to clean up the system			1
the best interest of accident victims must be at the heart of every assessment and change in the industry			0
’ news of the referral comes as @entity186 puts the finishing touches to the stock market flotation of its @entity190 insurance arm			2
but the investigation is not expected to throw the plans off track			0
today ’s report says : ‘ the @entity8 remains of the view that the potential consumer detriment is significant , taking into account there are approximately 23 million policy holders and that the impact of the features has been , and in the absence of a market investigation could continue to be , felt over a number of years			0
’ it says ‘ features it has identified are likely to be leading to higher costs which are passed on to consumers in higher insurance premiums ’			2
the cost of repairs and replacement vehicles to not - at - fault drivers alone is worth about £ 1.4billion a year			0
on the evidence it concludes : ‘ the @entity8 has reasonable grounds for suspecting that a feature or a combination of features of the market or markets for the supply or acquisition of private motor insurance and related goods or services in the @entity19 prevents , restricts or distorts competition in connection with their supply or acquisition			1
’ a referral upwards to the @entity10 for a full market investigation is therefore ‘ an appropriate response to the scale of the problem			0
’ the @entity235 ( @entity235 ) welcomed the referral to the @entity10 to ‘ tackle excessive costs ’ and help bring down premiums for drivers			2
@entity240 , director of general insurance at the @entity235 , said : ‘ the @entity8 found what insurers have known for years - that when a customer has a crash that is their fault , the insurer has little control over the cost of the subsequent claim			0
’ but @entity249 , director general of the @entity250 ( @entity250 ) which provides replacement cars for insured drivers said : ’ we continue to have serious concerns as to the long - term impact it may have on the motoring consumer and their right to mobility after an accident that was not their fault			0
’ he said : ’ we could see premiums soar as insurers try to make up losses as they are forced to pay out for replacement vehicles ; or insurers will find ways not to provide replacement vehicles and not - at fault drivers will be forced to ‘ make do ’ and catch the bus			2
‘ he insisted : ’ the consumer will lose out , and hundreds of years of case law , establishing the consumer ’s rights in the event of an accident , will be over-turned			0
‘ critics and mps have blamed ‘ ambulance chasing lawyers ’ and claims companies for the rise in so - called ‘ cash for crash ’ claims			0
the influential commons ’ transport select committee has already criticised a ' dysfunctional ' system which runs on a ' merry go round ' of so - called ' referral payments '			0
it also highlighted ' aggressive ' marketing techniques by the no - win - no fee firms , concluding that soaring car insurance premiums were being fuelled by a boom in ' abhorrent ambulance chasing ' by no - win - no - fee personal injury claim firms			1
and it criticised a scandalous cash - for - contacts culture that means within days or even hours of an accident , motorists ' personal details are being sold and re-sold on for under the counter ' fees ' of up to £ 1,000 a time - to lawyers , medical experts and accident management companies			0
motorists are then bombarded with hard - sell calls from ' no - win , no - fee firms ' and other offering to act on their behalf			0
in july the @entity315 revealed that car insurance had burst through the £ 1,000 barrier for the first time after an ‘ epidemic ’ of bogus whiplash and ‘ cash for cash ’ claims			1
the booming claims culture is adding to the rises as ‘ ambulance - chasing lawyers ’ push up the cost of premiums			0
the average fully comprehensive car insurance now costs £ 1,034 – up 8.5 per cent on a year ago when it was £ 955			1
but it more than doubled in just four years from july 2008 when the average fully comprehensive policy cost just £ 509 , according to the benchmark @entity334			0
the @entity335 has revealed how insurance companies are selling details of their clients to ' no - win , no - fee lawyers ' for up to £ 1,000 per person and in some cases up to £ 10,000			2
some 80 per cent of claims are for ' whiplash ' which is conveniently undetectable by scans or x-rays			0
@entity346 is the whiplash capital of @entity19 with one in every 50 residents making compensation claims			2
mps on the all - party @entity351 have also warned of a £ 2billion a year ‘ whiplash epidemic ’			0
they say soaring whiplash claims are the main cause of the ‘ runaway cost ’ of motor insurance adding up to £ 90 to every policy .			0
