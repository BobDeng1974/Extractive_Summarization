in one interview available online , the jihadi said he was ‘ craving martyrdom ’			0
‘ this is more important that my family			0
i would sacrifice my children 100 times for the sake of @entity14 , ' he said			0
yesterday , @entity0 ’s family told the @entity60 that authorities in the @entity7 could have stopped him murdering innocents by arresting him at the airport as he left for @entity42 16 months ago			1
despite being known to the authorities as an extremist , he had been allowed through airport security last year to join jihadis			0
@entity0 , who was known to have links to hate preacher @entity48 , had been calling for terrorist atrocities against the @entity69 on @entity70 and was being monitored by the @entity72 government			2
speaking from his brother @entity74 ’s terraced house in @entity1 , one female family member said : ‘ he died the day he left us			1
‘ we are very , very sad that we lost him			0
but if they had stopped him at the airport he would never have gone in the first place			0
’ his family are said to be moderate muslims who were ‘ heartbroken ’ when he left			0
a woman at his brother ’s house yesterday said they had no idea where he went			0

@entity0 ’s mother @entity94 , 53 , is said to have ‘ suffered a huge loss ’			2
friends said she ‘ had nothing to do with how @entity0 turned out ’			2
speaking in an online interview , @entity0 said it was @entity7 and @entity72 foreign policy in the @entity41 world that had led him to extremism			1
' it was n't the videos , it was n't the lectures , it was n't the books that i was reading			0
what radicalised me was the government			0
' the @entity72 government , the @entity7 government ... and what they were doing to our people in @entity19 and @entity117			1
' on friday , @entity0 – also known as @entity118 – killed eight people in an @entity44 suicide bomb attack			1
he is one of an estimated 500 @entity7 jihadis who have travelled to the @entity122 to fight for the barbaric terror group			1

those murdered included a senior military commander			0
@entity0 changed his name to @entity132 and fights with @entity3 ( file picture of @entity3 fighters in @entity42 ) an internet message board shows @entity0 and @entity48 had communicated online as recently as march , with @entity0 referring to the hate preacher as ‘ my brother ’			1
speaking from an internet cafe near his terror training camp in @entity141 , @entity42 , this summer , he told an online radio show : ‘ it ’s really , really fun			2
it ’s better than that game @entity145			0
it ’s like that but it ’s in @entity149 where everything is happening in front of you			0
’ a spokesman for the @entity24 said it was unlikely that @entity0 had been radicalised while there , since he had only studied there for four months			1
' we can confirm that a @entity0 studied at @entity24 between september 2003 and february 2004			2
he spent barely four months here and that was a decade ago , ' the spokesman said			2
' if this were the same person as is being reported in the media , then we believe it highly improbable that he was either radicalised or brainwashed while at @entity24 , as has been suggested			0
' considering the very short time that mr @entity0 was with us , and that he was convicted of a hate crime almost a decade after leaving @entity24 , it would suggest that he chose his path away from our university			2
' here at @entity24 , we have an excellent record of multi-faith and multi-cultural harmony and equality and diversity			0
we continue to work closely with the authorities to make sure that radicalisation is neither tolerated nor allowed any room at @entity24			0
' if this were the same student , we would , nonetheless , extend our thoughts and condolences to his family at what for them will be a very difficult time			0
' a @entity186 spokesman said : ‘ we are aware of reports of the death of a @entity7 national in @entity19 and are looking into them			1
’ the @entity191 said it would not comment on why @entity0 was allowed out of the country			2
returning @entity194 fighters are being offered ‘ jihadi rehab ’ instead of prosecution			0
many of the 300 young men who have arrived back from @entity42 and @entity19 have been offered places on the government ’s counter-radicalisation scheme , known as the @entity203 programme			1
the scheme has seen a 58 per cent rise – from 748 to 1,281 – in the number of referrals in the past year as the crisis in the @entity122 has grown			0
evidence of the softer approach comes despite assurances from home secretary @entity212 that terrorist sympathisers will face the full force of the law			0
she said new legislation should be ready by the end of this month as @entity219 insisted returning jihadis should face ‘ criminal investigations and prosecution ’			0
but @entity224 sources say securing evidence of terrorist activities committed 2,000 miles away in @entity42 is proving difficult .			2

@entity0 , 30 , was first to be jailed under *anti-discrimination* law in 2012
he had handed out hateful homophobic leaflets outside a mosque in @entity1
married father from @entity1 left to join militants in @entity42 16 months ago
