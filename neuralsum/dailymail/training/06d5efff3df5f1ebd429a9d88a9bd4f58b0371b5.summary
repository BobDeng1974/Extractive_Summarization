by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor unions planning a summer of strikes pose a threat to the economy , the @entity2 warned today as the government prepared for a stand - off over public sector pay			2
@entity10 , which has 1.3 million members , voted in favour of industrial action on july 10 , boasting it could be the biggest walkout since the @entity15			1
a number of trade unions are seeking to mobilise their members to cause disruption this summer , with teachers , firefighters , tax officials , civil servants , railway workers and midwives considering industrial action			1
public sector workers say their pay has been unfairly squeezed by spending cuts , but the government insists difficult decisions were needed to tackle the nation 's debts unison today announced that its local government members backed action by 58 per cent in protest at a pay offer worth 1 per cent for most workers			1
general secretary @entity41 , said : ‘ we expect to be joined in that action by other unions in local government and will be campaigning amongst our members for maximum support on that day			1
‘ many of our members are low paid women earning barely above the minimum wage , who care for our children , our elderly and our vulnerable and they deserve better treatment than they have had at the hands of this government			2
‘ the employers must get back into talks immediately to avoid a damaging dispute			0
’ @entity10 said local government workers have been ' condemned ' to three consecutive years of pay freezes , followed by below - inflation rises in 2013 and 2014 , leaving their pay reduced by almost 20 per cent since the coalition came to power			1
but conservative party chairman @entity64 told @entity1 : ' this strike is wrong			1
it will hurt hardworking people and families right across the country			0
' the government has had to take difficult decisions following @entity73 ’s @entity72			0
' but now that we are starting to see those sacrifices pay off , with a real and steady economic recovery , it is galling that trade union bosses want to put that at risk			2
' we have n’t heard a peep from @entity82 , of course			0
@entity82 is simply too weak to stand up to the trade union bosses who hold @entity73 ’s purse strings – and too weak to represent the @entity86 people			0
' the @entity87 also condemned the move , adding : ' it is disappointing that @entity10 will be proceeding with strike action			1
‘ local government staff have worked wonders while councils have been tackling the biggest funding cuts in living memory and we have no doubt that many will still be at work on the day of strike action			1
’ @entity10 is the first major union to announce strike action this week , with more expected within days			1
the @entity102 and @entity103 will announce voting results over the next week , while the @entity10 is also balloting its members for a strike in a long - running dispute over cuts in the civil service , with the result also due by the end of the month			1
members of the @entity113 will also take industrial action on july 10 , while firefighters in @entity116 and @entity117 have staged a series of walkouts over pensions over the past year and have not ruled out further stoppages			1
unison general secretary @entity41 predicts walkouts on july 10 will be the biggest since the @entity15 , but @entity122 party chairman @entity64 condemned the action for threatening the economic recovery midwives in @entity116 could soon be balloted for industrial action in protest at the government 's controversial decision not to accept a recommended 1 per cent across the board pay rise for @entity132 staff			1
thousands of midwives and maternity support staff are currently being consulted on whether they want a formal ballot for action			2
@entity137 , director of policy and employment relations at the @entity140 , said : ‘ midwives are really angry that the @entity129 said to them they 'd get a 1 % pay rise but now only staff at the top of their pay scales will get that rise , and it 's not consolidated into their pay			2
' @entity150 ( the health secretary ) has picked out health workers for harsher treatment on pay than anyone else in the public sector			0
' this is the time for midwives to take a stand because the government is intent on assaulting their pay and conditions			2
' other health unions are warning of ballots for industrial action , which could see a second wave of public sector strikes in in the autumn			0
civil servants at the @entity170 and tax workers are also expected to take industrial action in the coming days in separate disputes over jobs and privatisation			0
the @entity10 said tens of thousands of @entity177 staff across the @entity86 will hold rolling strikes this week , including in @entity179 and the @entity180 today , @entity181 and @entity182 and @entity183 tomorrow , @entity184 , the @entity185 and @entity186 on wednesday , @entity187 and @entity188 on thursday and @entity189 and @entity117 on friday			0
