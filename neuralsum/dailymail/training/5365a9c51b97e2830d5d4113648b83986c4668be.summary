many also needed intensive help to learn @entity6 but schools were struggling to find enough bilingual staff to teach them			2
children playing in a @entity4 settlement in @entity24			0
@entity0 said they when children arrive in the @entity26 from @entity5 language can be a major barrier to learning in schools in some cases , @entity4 parents were unaware of what they were expected to do for their children and had to be taken food shopping by teachers to help them fill lunchboxes			1
@entity0 warned that school budgets were being put under strain by the cost of extra provision			0
at one school in @entity44 , the number of @entity4 pupils rose from four to 99 – almost a third of its roll – in three years			1
the watchdog urged the government to ensure that funding for schools was more responsive to fluctuations in the pupil population			0
however , inspectors found no negative effect on the achievement of other pupils			0
the report follows visits to 11 schools in @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity44 – where there have been large increases in the number of @entity4 pupils from @entity5 after border controls were relaxed			1
@entity0 , led by chief inspector sir @entity65 , called for more support for schools in areas with a large @entity4 population in @entity60 , numbers rose from 100 to 2,100 in five years			1
@entity44 ’s @entity4 pupil population tripled to 600 between 2009 and 2013			2
@entity59 has an estimated 800 @entity4 pupils			1
nationally , the number of gipsy and @entity4 pupils in schools has risen 14 per cent in a year to 19,000			1
in a report entitled @entity77 , @entity0 said : ‘ in the local authorities and schools visited , almost all @entity4 pupils arriving from @entity5 were new to speaking @entity6			1
‘ where newly - arrived @entity4 pupils have had little prior experience of formal education , schools and local authorities reported that initially they had difficulty in engaging the pupils to adhere to school routines and meet expectations for good behaviour			1
’ inspectors said police were asked to address pupils and parents at one @entity44 primary after ‘ a number of playground fights involving @entity4 pupils ’			1
‘ they introduced a game to teach all children the rights and wrongs of behaviour , ’ it added			0
even when @entity4 pupils were well integrated in schools and made good progress , their achievement in exams was still low due to their ‘ exceptionally low starting points ’			2
the report went on to note that some schools felt obliged to meet the costs of lunches , uniforms and trips for @entity4 pupils despite not receiving funding to do so			2
it told of one family who failed to send their children to school with money or food for lunch when they started			0
‘ staff took the parent shopping to advise them on finding cheap and healthy options for packed lunches , ’ said inspectors			0
the report concluded that the schools and local authorities visited ‘ were struggling to find the necessary resources to fully meet @entity4 pupils ’ needs ’			2
a @entity136 spokesman said : ‘ the difficult decisions we have taken elsewhere in @entity139 have allowed us to protect the schools budget and ensure that local authorities and head teachers have the resources and flexibility to provide the support needed by their communities			0
