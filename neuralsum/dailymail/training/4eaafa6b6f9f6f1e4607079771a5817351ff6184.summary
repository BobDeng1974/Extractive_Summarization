sex could keep the @entity2 epidemic alive even after the @entity3 declares an area free of the disease , one of the discoverers of the deadly virus said on tuesday			1
the @entity3 is hoping to announce later this week that @entity9 and @entity10 are free of @entity2 after 42 days with no infections			1
the 42 days is the standard period for declaring an outbreak over , twice the maximum 21 - day incubation period of the virus			1
but @entity3 has some positive news : they are getting closer to declaring @entity9 and @entity10 free of @entity2 , after 42 days without any new infections however , it appears the disease can last much longer in semen			1
' in a convalescent male , the virus can persist in semen for at least 70 days ; one study suggests persistence for more than 90 days , ' the @entity3 said in an information note on monday			1
' certainly , the advice has to be for survivors to use a condom , to not have unprotected sex , for 90 days , ' said @entity42 , a professor at the @entity43 and a discoverer of @entity2 in 1976			1
' if we would apply the rule for double the time , that would be 180 days — six months , ' he told reporters in @entity49			0
' i think it ( 90 days ) is probably a compromise , for practicality			1
' @entity2 spreads via bodily fluids such as blood and saliva , but it has also been detected in breast milk and urine , as well as semen , the @entity3 says			1
the whole live virus has never been isolated from sweat , however			0
more than 3,400 people are already known to have died in the world 's worst @entity2 outbreak on record , the vast majority of them in three @entity18 countries : @entity69 , @entity19 and @entity70			0
meanwhile , @entity3 says @entity71 will almost inevitably see more cases of the deadly ebola virus within its borders — but the continent is well prepared to control the disease			2
speaking just hours after @entity71 's first local case of @entity2 infection was confirmed in a nurse in @entity81 , the @entity3 's @entity71 director , @entity77 , said further such events were ' unavoidable			2
' @entity81 health officials said four people had been hospitalised to try and stem any further spread of @entity2 there after the nurse became the first person in the world known to have contracted the virus outside of @entity18			0
a @entity19 @entity91 worker , dressed in an anti-contamination suit , speaks to @entity93 , 4 , in a holding center for suspected @entity2 patients at @entity96 in @entity97 ' such imported cases and similar events as have happened in @entity81 will happen also in the future , most likely , ' @entity98			0
' it is quite unavoidable ... that such incidents will happen in the future because of the extensive travel both from @entity71 to the affected countries and the other way around			0
' several countries in the @entity3 's @entity71 region , including @entity110 , @entity111 , the @entity112 , @entity113 , @entity114 , @entity115 and @entity81 , have treated patients repatriated after contracting the disease in @entity18 , where @entity2 has been raging through @entity69 , @entity70 and @entity19 since march			2
@entity2 has infected some 7,200 people in @entity18 , killing more than 3,400 of them in the largest outbreak of the disease in history			0
cases have also been imported into @entity9 , @entity10 and the @entity123			2
@entity77 said that within @entity71 , health workers caring for repatriated @entity2 patients , as well as their families and close contacts , were most at risk of becoming infected			0
' but the most important thing ... is that @entity71 is still at low risk and that the western part of the @entity71 region particularly is the best prepared in the world to respond to viral haemorrhagic fevers including @entity2			0
' health experts also warn that @entity71 will almost inevitably see more cases of @entity2 , such as the one of @entity137 ( pictured ) , a @entity81 priest who was diagnosed with the ebola virus while working in @entity70			2

ebola expert warns that the virus could remain alive in semen for up to 90 days , *increasing* the danger of contamination via unprotected sex
the @entity3 is hoping to announce later this week that @entity9 and @entity10 are free of @entity2 after 42 days with no infections
@entity2 spreads via bodily fluids such as blood and saliva , but it has also been detected in breast milk , urine and semen
