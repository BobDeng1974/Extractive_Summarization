' i have very close friendships but do n't want a significant other			2
i do n't want to find another asexual to be roommates with			2
' as far as i can tell i 'll be happy being single my whole life			2
' in a @entity29 video , miss @entity5 says that as a young teenager she kissed and cuddled both boys and girls			1
' we are perceived as not being fully human because sexual relationships are seen as something alive people do ' but she concluded : ' i never found anything that floated my boat			2
' she says that her family were convinced that she was a ' closet lesbian '			2
before she went to college her mother even took her to the doctors because she was n't expressing ' normal ' interest in the opposite sex			1
given the all - clear she carried on with her studies , graduating from the @entity47 in 2000 with a degree in elementary education and psychology			2
she said despite there being more awareness about asexuality today , it still remains largely misunderstood			0
she 's had male friends try and ' fix ' her by kissing her against her will and many insist that she will ' wake up one day '			1
an asexual is someone who does not experience sexual attraction			0
unlike celibacy , which people choose , asexuality is an intrinsic part of who we are			0
@entity67 does not make our lives any worse or any better , we just face a different set of challenges than most sexual people			0
there is considerable diversity among the asexual community ; each asexual person experiences things like relationships , attraction , and arousal somewhat differently			0
@entity67 is just beginning to be the subject of scientific research			0
source : @entity83 since opening up about being asexual on the internet , via @entity29 and her blog , miss @entity5 says that she ’s received death threats and been told by several commentators that she just needs a ' good raping			1
' ' when people hear that you 're asexual , some take that as a challenge , ' she told the @entity94			0
' we are perceived as not being fully human because sexual attraction and sexual relationships are seen as something alive , healthy people do			0
' they think that you really want sex but just do n't know it yet			1
for people who perform corrective rape , they believe that they 're just waking us up and that we 'll thank them for it later			0
' miss @entity5 says that asexuality presents itself in many forms			1
some people , while lacking sexual attraction to any gender , may engage in purely romantic relationships			0
however , she defines herself as ' aromantic ' , meaning she does not have any romantic feelings either			1
professor @entity113 , an associate professor at @entity114 in @entity115 , @entity116 , suggests in his book @entity67 , that around one per cent of the world 's population - 70million people - are ' asexual			1
he believes that this demographic are ' under - studied ' and that they can feel excluded from our ' very sexualised culture '			0
experts say a certain number of asexuals may have always existed but are only now starting to ' come out ' as society becomes more liberal			0
to her ‘ haters ’ , miss @entity5 concludes : ' i 'm not damaged , lonely or in need of a conversion because i 'm not interested [ in sex ]			1
' she hopes to raise awareness about asexuality through her writing and public speaking			0
' [ i want ] people who feel similarly to know they 're not alone			0
