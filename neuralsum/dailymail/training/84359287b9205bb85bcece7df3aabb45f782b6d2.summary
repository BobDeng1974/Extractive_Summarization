failing care homes will be taken over by teams of specialist troubleshooters under @entity3 plans to end the scandal of old age abuse			1
health secretary @entity6 told mps that the @entity9 watchdog , the @entity8 , would be given the power to put care homes in special measures if they were neglecting patients			1
he said : ' we must never again have a situation where the system knows there is a problem but the public do n't			2
' mr @entity6 added : ' there are still too many where i would personally not want my mother or my father or grandparents to live in			2
' health secretary @entity6 said standards in care homes were not good enough , after revealing plans for @entity29 - style inspections care homes will come to be seen as a quirk of the health service at the end of the last century , @entity30 argued putting hospital trusts in special measures was part of the government 's response to the @entity40 in which around 1,200 people needlessly died			1
an inquiry highlighted the ' appalling and unnecessary suffering of hundreds of people ' at the trust and investigations revealed that many patients were left lying in their own urine and excrement for days , forced to drink water from vases and given the wrong medication			0
a year ago , following a review into 14 other hospital trusts with higher than expected death rates , 11 trusts were put into special measures for a catalogue of failings and fundamental breaches of care			1
this afternoon mr @entity6 said that a similar system would be rolled out into care homes and home care services			1
from october services across @entity66 will face a tough new inspection regime , he said			0
care homes and home care services will receive @entity29 - style ratings and those rated inadequate face being put into special measures			1
if they fail to make improvements they could be shut down , mr @entity6 said			2
earlier this week it was also reported that a similar regime would be rolled out for @entity79 services			0
mr @entity6 said : ' there are many excellent home care providers and many outstanding care homes in this country , but there are still too many where i would personally not want my mother or my father or grandparents to live in			1
' the public have been really shocked by stories of abuse and neglect , and we need to give the public confidence that when these things happen they will be spotted quickly and acted on			2
' mr @entity6 added : ' when i have had relatives go into care homes the experience has been mixed			1
i have had ones that i have thought were ok and i have had ones that i was n't so happy with			0
' the judgment i made as a member of the public was usually about the feeling of compassionate care that you got from the staff who worked in the institution			2
' what you are not able to do as a member of the public is look with expert eyes that @entity116 's team are able to do			2
where this will really help is that it will give expert backbone to those judgements			0
' @entity30 ( right ) , who took up his role as chief executive of @entity66 earlier this year , called for new ways of looking after people at home @entity126 , the chief inspector of social care at the @entity8 , added : ' week in and week out people tell me and my team , or inspectors discover , truly awful care which should not be happening			0
' sometimes it 's abuse , older people treated roughly or worrying bruises that have no explanation			0
' sometimes it is neglect , people living with dementia not supported to eat and drink so they end up with malnutrition or life - threatening dehydration			0
' sometimes it 's a shocking lack of respect for people 's dignity , dressed in someone else 's clothes that do n't fit , men not having a regular shave because staff are too busy , no one taking the time to find out what makes you happy or just to talk to you			0
' it can all add up to a thoroughly miserable or frightening experience for people often in the most vulnerable of circumstances			0
' it does n't just affect the individual , it affects the whole family			0
the worst part of the letters i read sometimes is the distress and guilt that the family feel			0
it can be truly heartbreaking			0
' those examples of failing care reinforce my determination to make sure that we call time on poor care			1
' earlier this month the boss of the @entity9 said he would be ‘ disappointed ’ if nursing homes still existed in 50 years ’ time			1
@entity30 , chief executive of @entity66 , said that he believes better community care and advances in dementia research can be used to help people stay in their homes			2
it follows public concern about the treatment of the elderly in some care homes in recent years			1
mr @entity30 likened the concept of care homes to @entity190 beds , where patients were consigned on wards to be treated with the deadly disease .			1
