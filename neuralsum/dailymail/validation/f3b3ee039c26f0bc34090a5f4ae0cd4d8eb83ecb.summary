the saying ' always the bridesmaid , never the bride ' has certainly not rung true for one 35 - year - old mother - of - two			1
@entity4 has been a bridesmaid an astonishing seven times - and tied the knot herself in 2007			1
the in - demand bridesmaid from @entity8 , @entity9 , has been part of a wedding party so often she has joked about advertising her services as a ' bridesmaid for hire '			1
the start : @entity4 pictured the first time she was a bridesmaid in 2000 at her brother 's wedding but helping so many friends and family plan their hen parties and wedding days has come at a cost - she 's spent a total of £ 7,000 attending other people 's weddings over the past 14 years , an average of around £ 400 a year			1
each time she 's walked with a friend or relative down the aisle she 's been at a different stage in her own love life			1
she 's been a 20 - something single bridesmaid , an engaged bridesmaid , a married bridesmaid , and a pregnant bridesmaid over the years			1
@entity4 , who married @entity36 , 40 , in @entity37 in 2007 , said all her experiences have made her one of the best bridesmaids to have			1
speaking to celebrate @entity41 today , @entity4 said : ' i feel that as a bridesmaid you definitely evolve and become better at it			1
now i am thinking i might hire my services out			0

2005 was a busy year : @entity4 was a bridesmaid at her sister 's wedding , left , and for close friend , @entity54 , right ' the average cost of each hen party i have organised is £ 290 – for food , entertainment and extras			1
' i worked out i had spent around £ 5,080 over the years attending hen parties – not including my own			1

for each one i spend about £ 50 on the present , £ 70 on an outfit , £ 150 on travel and accommodation and if there is a paying bar an extra £ 50			2
i would say i spend around £ 200 per wedding			2

' both my sister and @entity54 had a hen weekend abroad and then in the @entity117 – so there was a lot of planning on my part			0
' she had her own wedding in 2007 - with two bridesmaids			2
she was then a bridesmaid for friend @entity98 , who was a mother - of - two in 2008 when she married @entity100			1
' @entity98 and @entity100 had two boys so the morning of the wedding was very different to my past bridesmaid experiences – it involved helping @entity98 but also entertaining two lads , ' @entity4 said			1
her friend @entity112 's wedding followed in 2009 when @entity4 was pregnant			1
she said : ' in 2009 my best friend @entity112 announced she would be getting married			0
i was overjoyed but also slightly worried as i was pregnant			0
