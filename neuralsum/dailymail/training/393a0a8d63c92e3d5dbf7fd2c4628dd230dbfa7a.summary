outspoken : rail minister @entity0 said opponents of @entity2 would come to realise it was in the national interest opponents of the controversial £ 42billion high speed rail line have been likened by a minister to anti-progress campaigners who did not want motorways built in the 1950s and 1960s			1
transport minister @entity0 risked escalating the row over the @entity12 project , which the government claims will cut travel times from @entity15 to @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18			1
the intervention came as the @entity20 rejected the latest legal challenge to the plan from 15 councils and campaign groups			1
the project ran into trouble when the government admitted recently that the bill had soared by £ 10billion to £ 42.6billion			1
however lord @entity29 is just the latest senior @entity31 figure to signal a collapse in support for the project			1
former labour cabinet minister @entity35 , ex-chancellor and former transport secretary @entity37 , and @entity39 chairman and former @entity41 mp @entity40 have all cast doubt on the scheme in recent weeks			2
but yesterday @entity44 reiterated @entity12 's importance , saying it was essential if @entity47 was to be a winner in the global race			0
today judges at the @entity20 dismissed all grounds of challenge but gave the go - ahead for a final appeal to the @entity55 , the highest court in the land			1
opponents had asked the appeal judges to order further assessment of the scheme as a whole			0
high speed rail minister @entity0 said : ‘ by dismissing all seven grounds of appeal and declining to refer the case to @entity67 , this is the second time in four months a court has rejected attempts to derail @entity12			1
" @entity70 is the right place to debate the merits of @entity12 , not the law courts , and we will introduce the hybrid bill for @entity76 before the year is out			0
‘ i urge opponents not to waste any more taxpayers ' money on expensive litigation and instead work with us on making @entity12 the very best it can be			0
’ campaign : opponents of @entity12 warn the costs of the project will spiral out of control and cause irreparable damage to the countryside speed : the government argues that travel times will be cut by the new line , boosting economies in the @entity94 and the north but in a provocative move , he claimed those against the project now would eventually see the error of their ways			1
he told @entity103 : ‘ there [ is ] going to be some damage to the environment because that ’s inevitable , but we have to be careful because people were against @entity110 1 in @entity111 and now they have come to appreciate the benefits it brings to the local community and to improving travel			2
‘ they were against motorways being built in the late 1950s , early ‘ 60s			0
and what we should be doing is working together to minimise and solve the problems while we go ahead with the scheme that is clearly in the national interest			0
‘ we continue to move forward with the crucial business of getting the scheme ready for construction in 2017 and delivering enormous benefits for the country			2
’ progress : opponents of high speed rail were likened to those people who did not support the building of motorways , like the @entity132 which opened in 1959 the objectors say the project will cause an unacceptable level of environmental damage , loss of homes and disruption to many communities - without the public having had a fair hearing and a chance to suggest reasonable , cheaper alternatives			1
halt : @entity31 's @entity35 now says his party was wrong to offer fulsome backing to the high speed rail project linking @entity15 and the north @entity151 , appearing for @entity149 ( @entity150 ) , told the appeal court the project had already blighted a swathe of properties along the route			1
he argued that it had been given the go - ahead in breach of @entity161 rules requiring a strategic environmental assessment ( @entity163 )			0
it was being seen as the country 's largest infrastructure project for a generation and the largest single rail project since the 19th century			1
but the decision in principle to proceed , taken by the @entity171 in january last year , breached a @entity172 requiring an sea			0
he asked three judges - @entity175 , the @entity176 , @entity177 and @entity178 - to overturn a @entity180 ruling in march			0
with the estimated cost of the line rising to £ 42.6billion , @entity35 said earlier this that those who previously backed the plan ‘ should not offer it an open cheque and should , instead , insist on keeping their options open			2
’ @entity31 ’s plans were based on an estimated cost of £ 30billion and the central assumption that construction would spread growth across the country			2
this was ‘ neither quantified nor proved ’ , said the peer			0
‘ i once supported @entity12			0
there are no simple options when it comes to transport – but i now fear @entity12 could be an expensive mistake , ’ he wrote in a national newspaper .			0
