by @entity0 a former @entity2 cheerleader says squad members were auctioned off at a charity golf tournament , and made to sit on the winner 's laps in just one of many demeaning tasks revealed in a new lawsuit against the football team			1
a 23 - year - old identifying herself as ' @entity12 ' is one of five former cheerleaders suing the team claiming she was underpaid and mistreated , and detailed the dark side of the job in an essay for the @entity20 published sunday			1
a native of @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 was a life - long fan of the @entity2 and considered it a ' huge accomplishment ' when she made the team for the 2012 - 2013 season			1
dirty job : @entity30 , @entity23 ( pictured ) is one of five former @entity2 cheerleaders suing the team , claiming she was underpaid , mistreated , and even sexually harassed impossible standards : @entity24 , a life - long @entity2 fan , was initially excited when she made the team for the 2012 - 2013 season			1
but soon realized she was in over her head after reading the detailed contract			0
above , @entity37 cheer at a football game on august 9 , 2012 but after looking over her contract , she knew she was in over her head			0
the contract detailed everything about being a @entity42 , from appropriate nail polish to how to properly sip soup at a formal dinner			2
' i was taken back by it all			0
it ’s embarrassing to even talk about , ' @entity24 told the @entity20			1
being a @entity42 also required attending an annual charity golf tournament where squad members either performed tasks ( like sitting at the dunk tank ) or were auctioned off to ride along with the highest bidder in their golf car			1
' basically there were four seats to a golf cart — basically four men			0
so where was this @entity42 to sit ? well , in the golfer ’s lap. it was very inappropriate , ' @entity24 said			2
sexual harassment : one of the many demeaning tasks the @entity37 were made to do included being auctioned off at an annual charity golf tournament , sitting on the lap of the highest bidder the cheerleaders also had to endure grueling criticism about their bodies , routinely submitting to ' @entity72 ' in front of team management			2
if their body did n't look good while performing jumping jacks , they could be benched for a game			0
@entity24 says that while the cheerleaders understood there were weight standards for being a professional cheerleader , judgements about weight often seemed random			0
footing the bill : @entity24 was allegedly told by team management that her blonde hair was not ' field ready ' and that she would need to pay for it to get re-colored by a stylist who knew the ' jills look ' and also happened to be best friends with the coach			1
pictured above in a photo from her @entity94 account ' the inconsistency with the physique evaluations was pretty much a mind game			0
how someone ’s weight could fluctuate from one week to the next — someone was field ready one week , not the next , and was the week after that , it was very emotional for these girls			0
' management specifically had a problem with @entity24 's blonde hair when she joined the team , and she was deemed not ' field ready '			2
' i was told it was not natural looking , and that i needed to go see the @entity42 ’s hairstylist who knew “ the @entity37 look ” — who also happened to be the coach ’s best friend			1
' and it was n’t free			0
you have to pay her , that ’s not for free — but we got a $ 5 discount , so it was around $ 85 , ' she says			2
the @entity37 are n't paid for games or practices and have to make 20 - 35 appearances , most of which are unpaid , at community and charity events each season , the lawsuit said			1
pay is $ 35 dollars an hour for a maximum of two hours , meaning some girls ended up making just $ 1,800 for an entire season			2
and yet , like @entity24 's hair coloring , they were made to pay for everything - including their $ 650 uniforms			1
@entity24 says that while she thought of quitting the team several times , she decided to tough it out until the end of the season because she loved the team so much			0
' i have never been a quitter			0
cheering for the @entity2 was a life long dream and i felt it was only right to honor my commitment and not let my fellow team mates down , ' she said			1
but now she and four other former cheerleaders are hitting back , suing the team , as well as two companies that have managed the cheer squad			1
underpaid : @entity24 ( right ) and former teammate @entity157 ( center ) appeared in a press conference tuesday with their lawyer @entity160 , and said they were exploited out of ' 840 hours of work ' on tuesday , @entity24 and another former squad member , identified as ' @entity165 ' , held a news conference with their attorney , @entity160 , explaining how they were each exploited out of ' 840 hours of work '			0
the women say they were wrongly classified as independent contractors by @entity173 , which manages the @entity37 and failed to pay them for hundreds of hours of work during 2012 and 2013 season			0
@entity173 - the current company managing the @entity37 - announced that it will be suspending the team pending the lawsuit .			2

@entity179 , @entity23 is one of five former @entity2 cheerleaders suing the team for being underpaid and mistreated
the 23 - year - old told about the dark side of the job to the @entity20
she and other cheerleaders were subjected to demoralizing physical tests and had to *adhere* to the @entity42 's strict *glamour* requirements
they also had to pay for everything - including their $ 650 uniforms - while not getting paid for many events they are required to attend
