by @entity0 for the @entity1 @entity3 has four children , the youngest of which , @entity2 , has just turned 13 most busy mothers yearn for that moment in the evening when they can grab some precious time to themselves and , certainly , i ’m no different			1
but a few weeks ago as i sat down to enjoy the peace and quiet , an emotion inside me shifted and i suddenly found myself sobbing hot , stinging tears			2
it was the silence that did it			2
there was nobody home and in that moment , i saw my future flash before my eyes			2
quite simply , i felt overwhelmed with the heartbreaking loneliness of life as a mum of older children			1
not that i ’m an ‘ empty - nester ’ — far from it			1
my nest is still very full			2
it ’s just that the youngest of my brood of four has turned 13 , two are now in their 20s and none of them wants much to do with me any more			1
not so long ago saturday evenings were a different story			2
we ’d all watch tv together with the children sprawled out on sofas and rugs			1
now , when i look back on it , those were wonderful nights			2
one of them would usually fall asleep curled up on my lap and i would carry them up to bed , breathing in the delicious smell of their warm , milky skin			2
now , i ’m redundant , obsolete : a service for providing clean jeans , food and cash , to be utilised only when necessary			1
i find myself with all the time in the world , and the great irony is — i do n’t want it			2
indeed , i feel utterly bereft and would give anything to go back to those chaotic days , before the teenage years , when i was the centre of my children ’s universe — when i could n’t even take a trip to the bathroom unaccompanied			1
i ’m not saying that having four young children was easy			1
mornings in our house were particularly stressful — making sure everyone ate breakfast , brushed their teeth and had all the kit they needed to get out of the door on time			2
then i ’d spend hours after school ferrying them to activities — horse - riding , gymnastics , swimming , @entity79 dancing — they only had to show a passing interest and i was there , with cheque book and carefully researched itinerary memorised and marked on the calendar			1
i used to dread supermarket shopping on saturday mornings , when we resembled a travelling circus			2
i ’d turn my back for a minute to read the ingredients on a packet and all four children would be running up and down the aisles , leaving me desperate for some peace and calm			1
@entity96 feels like her children barely notice she 's around anymore but , exhausting though it was , i knew exactly what my role entailed and i felt fulfilled performing it			1
in fact , i would go back to those days in a heartbeat			0
now , aged 53 , i do n’t know what to do with myself			0
i put my career ambitions on hold after having my eldest , son @entity110 , now 24 , when i was 29 , and my children have been my priority ever since			1
today , @entity110 , lives with his girlfriend a few miles away in @entity114			1
@entity115 , 21 , who ’s a hairdresser , and @entity2 , 13 , still live at home while @entity117 , 18 , started a business studies degree at @entity119 last october and comes home every weekend and during the holidays			1
my husband of 22 years , @entity97 , 51 , is an accountant who works long hours and often at weekends to cover the bills and mortgage repayments on our four - bedroom modern detached house in @entity128			1
i suppose i should be grateful that our three girls get on famously well when they ’re home			0
they spend hours in one another ’s rooms , gossiping , laughing and swapping clothes , leaving me on the periphery — uninvited			0
they barely notice i ’m around			0
and who can blame them ? as a middle - aged woman , i ’m just not on their wavelength any more			1
probably , all mothers bemoan the same thing			0
but it ’s as if , since they entered their teens , they ’ve moved to a different planet			0
when they were little , i knew all the names of their favourite tv characters , and the words to their nursery rhyme songs			0
naively , i expected that i ’d always be able to share in their interests			0
and i do try , but i get the distinct feeling they do n’t want my input , and find my attempts mildly embarrassing			1
as @entity2 is my last child , i ’ve tried to hold onto her as much as i can			1
but she has always looked up to her big sisters and the pull to look and act like them is far greater than any desire to listen to what her old mum says			0
so now @entity2 has well and truly cut the apron strings , too , and , like her sisters , has an amazing social life			0
she plays women ’s rugby twice a week and she and her friends go to the cinema , ice - skating and horse - riding			1
my social life , by contrast , was put on the back burner to raise my family and , as a result , it could take years to reignite it			1
i still cook a big dinner every night — lasagne , risotto , pasta with a homemade sauce , the foods they adored as little ones			0
but unlike when they were younger and we all sat down together at 6.30 pm , and chatted about our days , i ca n’t remember the last time we had a family meal			0
three of @entity96 's children are pictured here @entity115 , @entity192 and @entity110			1
@entity96 recognises that it is not just her children that are n't keen to spend time with their parents , it 's a regular occurrence in children their age on the rare occasions we manage it , our conversations are interrupted by the beeps and pings from their smartphones			1
but mostly i end up heating up the food , one plate at a time , as and when my family deigns to come home			0
at other times they come in and go straight to their rooms to watch tv , unless they have something to say like : ‘ can you wash my sports kit ? ’ or ‘ would you book those concert tickets for me ? ’ it ’s such a far cry from the days , not so long ago , when i would look for their little faces as they came out of primary school and they would scan the crowds of waiting parents looking for mine , and i ’d see them light up with delight			0
i could kick myself now as i remember pushing them on swings in the park and feeling on edge because there were so many other things i thought i should have been doing			1
i ’d give anything to be able to go back in time and enjoy one of those days , one more time			0
i realise now , with great nostalgia , that it was the loveliest time of my life			0
having spoken to friends , i do n’t think my children are any less keen on hanging around with their parents than others their age			2
our eldest daughter , @entity115 , is on holiday in @entity250 and , before she went , i overheard @entity2 comment : ‘ i do n’t know what i ’ll do without you			0
i ’ll be so bored stuck here with @entity255 and @entity256			0
’ her words stung , but i told myself to swallow my pride and take advantage of the situation , so i invited @entity2 to join me for a weekend at a beautiful spa hotel on the @entity128 coast			0
she turned me down flat : apparently , she ’d already made weekend plans with her friends			2
to fill the void , i have started over-eating			2
sitting alone , i will think ‘ i ’ll open that box of chocolates ’ and then , because there ’s no one there to share them , i ’ll finish the lot			0
what ’s isolating about the loneliness of being a mum of older children is that i do n’t deserve sympathy because my children are doing the most natural thing in the world : growing up			1
i left home in my late teens and , ironically , i remember pulling away from my own parents , becoming selfish and distant			0
but , once i became a mother myself , i grew close to them again			0
we shared an interest as they indulged me when i pored over each baby ’s milestone , their first smiles , words , teeth and steps			0
i hope i do n’t have to wait until i ’m a grandmother to get my own brood back , but at least i can be confident that , by staying close and remaining supportive , it will happen one day			0

@entity3 has four children , the youngest of which has just turned 13
although she is not yet an ' empty - nester ' , she feels redundant in their lives
@entity96 's children have been her priority since she put her career on hold
now she 's feeling the void , having older children who no longer need her *constant* care and attention
