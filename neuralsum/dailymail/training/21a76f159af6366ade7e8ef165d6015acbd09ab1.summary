by @entity0 police are investigating a new lead in the baffling disappearance of flight mh370 - the possibility that the plane 's huge cargo of exotic fruit could have contained a hidden explosive device			1
there was laughter at a press conference in @entity13 when officials revealed that the only cargo on the @entity17 jet was a four - ton consignment of mangosteens , a purple - skin tangy fruit with white segments inside that 's popular in @entity24 countries			1
but we 've now learned that police are trying to establish whether there was a deadly link to the seemingly harmless cargo ordered by companies in @entity31			1
mystery : investigators are now looking into a possible theory that a bomb was hidden inside a crate of fruit on board @entity38 it has not escaped investigating officers that it would be easy to conceal explosive material inside a number of the thousands of pieces of fruit loaded in crates onto the aircraft			1
@entity51 ceo mr @entity50 , confirming that ' three to four tons ' of mangosteens were on the aircraft , insisted that the cargo had been screened as a matter of routine			1

several theories are being investigated , including that there was a bomb on board but an intelligence source in @entity13 said today that it would not be difficult to ' bury ' some kind of explosive material inside the fruit , particularly if it was in the centre of a crate			1
that explosive could then be set off electronically by someone on board the aircraft , prepared to die if the blast brought the jet down			2
the triggering device could have been hidden inside an innocent looking mobile phone , experts say			1
investigators have not ruled out the possibility of a major catastrophic event causing the aircraft to suddenly soar up to 45,000ft , rendering everyone on board unconscious , particularly if a blast in the cargo hold had torn a hole in the side of the frame			2

authorities now believe someone on board the @entity17 shut down part of the aircraft 's messaging system about the same time the plane with 239 people on board disappeared from civilian radar out of control , it could have turned sharply westwards and continued flying straight out into the @entity105 until it ran out of fuel			1
' this is yet another theory , ' said a police officer			0
' but we are not discounting anything			0
' acting transport minister @entity58 has also said that nothing is being ruled out and that all theories and possibilities were being investigated			0
but he said that no official comment would be made on any information until it could be completely confirmed			0
all ground crew at the airport - ' anyone who has touched the aircraft ' , said mr @entity50 - are under investigation as the probe into the jet 's fate continued today			2

and further investigations are being carried out into the backgrounds of two @entity137 known to have used stolen passports to board the flight as the first leg of a purported journey to @entity142 to start new lives			0
intelligence sources in @entity137 have told @entity56 investigators and @entity146 that @entity147 , 19 , and @entity148 , 29 , have no known links to terrorist groups			0
they are believed to have purchased the stolen passports in @entity13 , from where , investigators have established , asylum seekers using stolen @entity153 passports have set out to fly to @entity142 .			0
