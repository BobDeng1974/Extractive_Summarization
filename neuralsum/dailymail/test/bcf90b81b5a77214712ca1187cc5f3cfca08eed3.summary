@entity1 captain @entity0 feared @entity3 's international career was over 18 months ago , but feels he is now ready to face the ' pressure cooker ' once again			1
@entity3 dramatically left the 2013/14 @entity6 trip after just one match at the @entity8 having struggled with what was initially labelled a ' stress - related condition ' and later diagnosed as situational anxiety			1
@entity0 was concerned that would be the end of his @entity14 days but has watched the 33 - year - old rebuild his career with typical focus and determination , first with @entity19 then during a productive winter tour with @entity21			1
@entity3 during a nets session as he returned to the international scene and could be ready to play the pair are now heavy favourites to open the batting together in @entity27 this month and should get a first chance against a @entity29 on monday			1
uncapped @entity31 @entity30 is the other top - order batsman on tour but @entity3 appears to have first claim after batting alongside the skipper in saturday 's centre - wicket practice session at @entity36			1
' he was in a bad place in @entity38 and at the time i would have been surprised that he 'd come back , but it 's a huge credit to the work he 's done off the field and the effort he 's put in , ' said @entity0			1
' that obviously shows his desire to come back to play for @entity21			2
test captain @entity0 feels the batsman is ready for the ' pressure cooker ' of international cricket ' he has almost demanded selection with the runs he has scored for @entity19 and it 's great for me to see him back in an @entity21 shirt			1
he 's a great guy and if he gets his chance he 'll be desperate to do well			0
' @entity0 accepted there was no guarantee over how @entity3 would react to the glare of the international game , which remains several notches beyond anything he will have experienced on the county or @entity21 circuit			1
but with a cv boasting 49 tests , 3,763 runs and nine centuries , @entity0 is delighted to have him back on board and nudging the selectors for a recall			2
' i am ( confident ) , but you do n't know 100 per cent until he 's put out in the environment - that is always unknown , ' he said			0
@entity3 ( left ) and @entity0 train together during a batting session at @entity36 , @entity78 , @entity79 & @entity80 ' there 's a lot of things about selection that are unknown until you 're put into the pressure cooker of international cricket and , make no mistake , it 's a high - intensity environment , there 's no doubt about that			1
' but @entity93 's done everything we 've asked of him			0
he feels confident in himself and he 's just looking forward to taking that next step			0
' what we do know is he 's a quality player			0
you do n't have his stats and that weight of runs behind you without being a quality player			0
' for his own part , @entity0 is in need of a successful series both as captain and run - scorer			2
the last of his 25 test centuries came in may 2013 and he was stripped of the one - day captaincy on the eve of the @entity111 , though in hindsight his absence from the tournament may have been a blessing given @entity21 's travails			2
the @entity19 batsman has been in fine form for them and rightly deserved his call - up now , rested and recharged following his enforced spell at home , he is setting his sights on nothing short of victory in the three - @entity1 series			1
' it 's been great to spend a bit of time at home , live a bit more of a normal life away from the travelling circuit of cricket , ' he said			0
' that 's been great , at home with my family , but now it 's the serious business of trying to win the series here			0
' it 's always important we win			0
when you play for @entity21 you carry the hopes and the pride of the nation on your shoulders			2
' that has n't changed since the day i started playing			0
' @entity3 looks for a single during a training session at @entity36 , @entity78 , @entity79 & @entity80			0

@entity0 feels @entity3 is ready to return to the @entity21 *squad*
@entity3 left the international stage last year with ' situational anxiety '
the batsman has been *impressive* for his side @entity19
