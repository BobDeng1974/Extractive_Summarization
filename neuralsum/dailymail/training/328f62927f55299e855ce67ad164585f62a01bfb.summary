reading a map on a smartphone can be distracting and cumbersome			0
but now two engineers have created a shoe that can guide the wearer by simply vibrating			2
the footwear ’s investors claim they have created the world ’s first ' haptic feedback shoe ' and while they initially designed it to be used by the visually impaired , they think their technology could prove useful to anyone navigating their way around a new city			1
they can do this as they are linked to a smartphone via @entity34 to ascertain the wear 's location and destination			1
the shoes and insoles were orginally designed to help visually - impaired people			1
connectivity : the shoes will work with @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity46 smartphones			0
charging : the shoes and insoles contain rechargeable vibrating units that work with a usb charger that can be switched on and off using voice controls and finger clicking			0
fitness : @entity54 shoes and insoles can also count steps and calories burned with the help of an accompanying app. workouts can be created by individuals and goals set			0
cost : the shoes and insoles are available to pre-order and cost $ 100			2
the @entity15 shoe is the brainchild of @entity18 and @entity19 , engineering graduates from the @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70 , who now live in @entity71 , @entity72 and originally designed it to help the estimated 285 million visually impaired people across the globe			1
the shoes will be connected to a user ’s smartphone via a @entity34 connection to work out a person ’s location as well as their destination			1
this information means the shoes will ' know ' when to tell the wearer to turn left or right and they will vibrate accordingly – the left shoe to indicate a left turn , for example			1
while this could prove very useful for visually impaired people who can struggle to navigate cities , the duo have made their shoes available for pre-order to everyone as they think the footwear will make it easier for people to find their way around hands - free without having to read a map on their smartphone			1
the shoe 's name comes means ‘ take me there ’ in @entity109			0
polyurethane insoles ( pictured ) have also been designed to fit inside any pair of shoes and feature the same technology as the shoes			2
the insoles buzz to indicate whether the wearer should turn left or right the shoes and insoles contain an electronic module ( pictured ) that includes a vibrating unit , chip and battery that can be removed to be charged and come with a usb charger that can be switched on and off using voice controls and finger clicking polyurethane insoles have also been designed to fit inside any pair of shoes and feature the same technology as the shoes			1
they contain an electronic module that includes a vibrating unit , chip and battery that can be removed to be charged and come with a usb charger that can be switched on and off using voice controls and finger clicking			0
these features will also make it user friendly for visually impaired people and the fully - charged units can be used for three days of navigation			1
the shoes are designed for visually impaired people to be used alongside a cane ( pictured ) while they can not look out for traffic like a guide dog , the shoes buzz to indicate whether a wearer should turn left or right and can lead them to their destination the shoes ( pictured ) and insoles are available for pre-order for $ 100 and can also be used as a fitness device alongside an app , which is able to track calories and routes people will also be able to use the @entity15 shoes and insoles as a fitness system to count steps and calories burned , as well as create their own workouts			1
a wearer will be able to tap their foot to tag a location and set goals and the shoes can also buzz when a runner goes past a place of interest			2
while the shoes are designed to be used by everyone , they are principally made for the blind and profits made will be used to subsidise pairs of shoes for underprivileged visually impaired people			1
they are now available for pre-order on the company ' website and both the insoles and the shoes will cost $ 100 , according to @entity184			2
the hi - tech footwear could make it easier for people to find their way around a new city hands - free without having to read a map on their smartphone ( illustrated ) a @entity194 - based fashion and technology company has created the navigate jacket that comes with a gps unit built into the sleeves			0
as the wearer walks , drives or cycles , either the left or right sleeve vibrates to tell them which way to turn			2
if the turning is on the left , the left shoulder of the jacket vibrates , and vice versa if the turning is on the right			0
to create the jacket , electronic circuits and leds were sewn into the sleeves			0
the wearer programs their destination using a custom - made mapping app that connects wirelessly to the jacket			0
as the wearer moves , the leds in the jacket 's sleeves light up to warn them they are approaching a turning			0
each sleeve is fitted with five lights and the number of illuminated lights decrease the closer the wearer gets to this turning .			0

the @entity15 shoe is the brainchild of two engineering *students* in @entity72 and was originally designed to help visually impaired people
shoes are connected to a user ’s smartphone via @entity34 to ascertain a person ’s *current* location as well as their destination
they vibrate to tell the wearer to turn left or right
shoes and insoles can be pre-ordered for $ 100
