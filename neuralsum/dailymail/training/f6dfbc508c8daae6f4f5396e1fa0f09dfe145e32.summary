by day , @entity0 is a sharp - suited queen of the boardroom whose tenacity and talent have brought her enviable success as an international educational consultant			1
but at home , the 32 - year - old mother is the epitome of an old - fashioned wife , ensuring the house runs like clockwork			2
still , there 's one daily ritual she adamantly refuses to take part in - eating with her husband , @entity16			1
' i 've made a very calculated decision to limit the times we sit and eat together			1
it 's just so unappealing , ' she says			1
' instead , @entity25 , from @entity32 , @entity33 , dines with their four children : @entity36 , 12 , @entity37 , 11 , @entity38 , eight , and @entity39 , six			2
@entity25 , a slender size 10 , says her attitude towards food had been set long before she met @entity16			2
the daughter of a teacher and a policeman , she had it drummed into her from an early age that her attractiveness was inextricably linked to what and how she ate			2
' eating cereal is a particular problem , ' she says			0
' the noise is simply unbearable			0
corn on the cob is even worse - messily eating with your fingers makes you so unappealing			1
' it 's a relief not to have to eat with @entity16 and also that he is happy to dine while i sit and chat to him			1
' at the weekends , when we do eat together as a family , i will only eat a small portion - half a chicken breast and a few vegetables - so i still look elegant and self - controlled			1
' but surely an intimate dinner as a couple is one of life 's pleasures ? there is something delicious about sharing an indulgent pudding with your partner , and men often comment that they find a hearty appetite appealing in a woman			1
he is grateful that @entity25 largely keeps the unedifying business of eating away from his gaze - and appreciates her constant efforts to keep her weight in check			0
' it shows she cares about how she behaves in front of me ; too many women do n't			1
she does n't make a big issue out of it and is very discreet			1
i would find it unattractive to see @entity25 tucking into huge portions or unhealthy meals			1
' dr @entity92 , a chartered clinical psychologist and author of several books about our relationships with food , says it 's surprisingly common for women to feel uneasy dining in front of their partner			0
@entity103 : @entity25 is happy to eat in the kitchen away from her husband 's eyes ' we are socially conditioned to feel negative about our bodies , even when we 're slim , which naturally makes us self - conscious about what we are seen to eat , ' she explains			1
' many of us use food as a means of communicating something about ourselves - ordering a salad or refusing chocolate , for example , makes us think that others will be impressed by our restraint			0
we fear being judged and that our choices reflect not just our figures but also our personalities			0
' @entity25 has been self - disciplined from her first date with @entity16 , 38 , a company director - inconveniently , at a steak restaurant in @entity125 , where she opted for a light chicken dish and side salad			0
' i ordered a panna cotta for dessert but ate just two small mouthfuls before declaring that although it was delicious , i was full			0
to me , that portrayed femininity			0
' i behave in exactly the same way in front of my friends and so do they			0
i ca n't remember the last time one of them ordered something masculine such as pie or chips			2
' although @entity25 may surreptitiously enjoy a biscuit with a cup of tea if she 's on her own , in the evening she will lay just one setting at the dining table			0
' i 'm happy watching @entity16 eat a manly steak or large portions			1
i do all the cooking in our household , and consider feeding him well as another way of showing that i care			0
' @entity157 's fear of dining with her doctor husband @entity158 , 43 , however , is inextricably linked to gaining almost two stone since they met five years ago			1
the 35 - year - old blog editor has gone from a petite size 8 to a 12 and is now ashamed to sit at the same dinner table as him			0
' i 've hardly eaten in front of @entity158 since our wedding three years ago , ' says @entity157 , who lives in @entity168			1
' it 's had a huge impact on our social life			0
last weekend , we went to our favourite @entity173 restaurant but while he tucked into three courses , the only thing i ate was a starter of fried courgettes			0
not because i 'm on a diet , but because i simply did n't want to appear indulgent in front of him			1
' fears looking greedy : @entity183 's awkwardness about eating with her husband stems from worries about her weight her awkwardness first manifested itself in early 2011 , 18 months into their relationship , by which point she 'd gained around 10lb through a mixture of contentment , work commitments and little time to exercise			1
' we were wedding planning in the pub over a sunday roast , and i 'd already decided i 'd order sticky toffee pudding for dessert , ' she recalls			0
' then @entity158 started talking about how he 'd upped his gym regime ahead of the wedding and i stared down at my big plate of food , disgusted			2
' how could i eat like that in front of the man i was going to marry when i was already bulging out of my clothes ? @entity158 's never said or done anything to make me feel self - conscious			1
but i 've been so vocal about hating my weight gain that it seems hypocritical to then be seen eating			0
' perhaps because of his job as a psychiatrist , @entity158 does n't question my behaviour or make an issue of it , he just tells me i look great and encourages me to join a netball team or the gym			1
' only one in ten @entity222 families sit down and eat a meal together , and a fifth of those will spend fewer than ten minutes at the table in fact , @entity158 admits that he feels ' uncomfortable ' when @entity157 hides away to eat in the kitchen , especially when he 's in the house			1
' i miss seeing her looking happy and relaxed at the dinner table , ' he says			0
' i honestly never scrutinise @entity157 's weight or what she eats			1
to me , she is still the beautiful woman i married			0
' although @entity233 , 35 , a project manager from @entity234 , is not yet at the stage where she avoids eating in front of husband @entity237 , 36 , a consultant in the travel industry , altogether , she empathises with @entity157 's angst			1
' in restaurants , i 'll pick the smallest piece of bread from the basket and pass the rest to @entity237 , and order lean chicken instead of the juicy steak i 'd prefer			0
' if he 's at work on a saturday , i see that as my opportunity to eat whatever i want			2
' @entity183 's issues also relate to her weight - she was a size 10 when she and @entity237 started dating in 1999 but is now a 16			0
@entity237 , on the other hand , has always been sporty and has spent the past decade regularly running marathons			0
' he has the metabolism of a horse , so eats like one , ' @entity183 says			2
frustrated : @entity237 wants his wife to be happy and worry less about what she eats @entity183 began feeling awkward eating in front of her husband a year after their wedding in 2003			1
' i remember devouring a stack of pancakes for breakfast one morning on holiday in @entity269 , then reading on the menu that they contained 1,400 calories			0
i was horrified that i looked greedy in front of @entity237 , although he insisted he was not bothered			2
' for the past decade i 've tried to make sure my portions are feminine compared to @entity237 's because i do n't want to appear greedy			1
' @entity183 admits her willpower is part of her personality : ' i am highly organised and quite controlling so i feel like a failure because i 'm not in control of my eating habits - which is why , publicly at least , i try to look like i am in control			0
' yet @entity237 admits his wife 's private war over meal times makes him sad			0
' i just want her to be happy and healthy and to eat what she truly wants to			2
it 's frustrating to see her restricting what she eats as i know it detracts from her enjoyment of a meal			2
' i think men are much easier going than we are given credit for and i do n't think most men judge women on what they eat			1
' there 's far too much pressure on people , especially women , to look , be and eat a certain way			2
' i wish @entity183 could find a way to balance food and physical activity so that she worries less about what she eats			2
' the day we order a cheeseboard for two in a restaurant and i can sit and watch her indulge to her heart 's content is one i will cherish			0

@entity0 refuses to eat with her husband
she fears doing so will make her look unattractive to him
he agrees seeing her tuck into big portions would be unappealing
@entity157 eats tiny portions if she eats with her man
she does n't want to appear indulgent
@entity233 also does n't want to appear greedy to her husband
