i am here today to let everybody know that i am fine and i am here with my children , and my children would never do a thing to me like that , holding me against my will			0

who was @entity128 ? before i left i put everything in order with the appropriate people to take care of my children for me and it 's really bad to hear that what 's going on at home , and the children have been taken away - but i know that ... i 'll get there in time to get them back			2

the latest feud between the @entity156 is said to have been stemmed from a dispute over @entity158 's $ 500million will			0
@entity158 died in june 2009 at age 50 and left his estate to care for his mother and three children			2
he left nothing to his father or siblings , who have repeatedly tried to intervene in the estate			0
several have expressed doubts about the validity of his will , although the courts have rejected this			0
following yesterday 's ruling @entity49 , the son of @entity44 's brother @entity174 , will now get access to funds from the estate in order to care for the children , who are said to be in favour of him being their temporary guardian			1
before the judge : an artist 's impression of @entity49 's court hearing @entity49 became tearful in court as he told judge @entity188 how he had a strange phone conversation with @entity7			1
official : the court document showing @entity49 has been appointed as temporary guardian of the late @entity158 's three children ' i 've never heard my grandmother talk like that , ' said @entity49 , who once dated @entity198			1
saying he thought she was talking in code , he went on : ' she was n't sharp			0
the pauses , choice of vocabulary ... she has not used certain phrases like that before			0
' members of her house are said to have been ' alarmed and nervous ' after @entity7 's call - with sources telling @entity213 the ' prevailing view is that @entity215 and company have drugged their mom '			1
judge @entity188 said that his understanding was that @entity49 's application was not a ' power play '			2
while members of the @entity158 clan are feuding over @entity44 's estate @entity49 is not one of them			2
earlier this week @entity49 's father @entity174 withdrew from the plot - involving @entity215 , @entity20 , @entity19 and @entity21 - to overthrow the executors of their brother 's will , which leaves everything to his children and nothing to them			1
judge @entity188 said @entity7 's guardianship was not suspended for wrongdoing - but argued she has been prevented from doing her duties by ' intentional acts from third parties ' - an apparent reference to @entity215 , @entity20 , @entity19 and @entity21			1
tough talk : @entity7 lawyer , @entity241 , gives a press conference after the hearing and said he will file a motion to get her reinstated as guardian upon her return to @entity247 @entity49 's attorney , @entity248 described the situation as dire			1
he said : ' there 's immediate harm to the minor children , there was a potential abduction at the house , in addition to a phone call from @entity7 last night that gave us real concern			2
@entity260 went on : ' we are looking at this as a @entity263 until @entity264 returns or re-establishes contact with the kids			0
' one of @entity7 's lawyers , @entity268 , added : ' i have reason to believe she 's being held against her will			1
' confused : @entity30 , @entity51 and @entity272 have been pining for their grandmother over recent days another of @entity7 's lawyers , @entity241 , said he will file a motion to get her re-instated as guardian upon her return to @entity247			1
the judge also ordered that @entity30 , @entity51 and @entity52 should not be removed from @entity281 without a court order - and urged @entity49 to file for permanent guardianship			1
@entity49 claimed he had previously assisted his grandmother with caring for his cousins			1
in court papers seen by website @entity213 he claims that before @entity7 left the house she had placed her grandchildren in his care			1
@entity1 updates : @entity51 tweeted this picture of herself seeking solace : @entity51 quoted lyrics from her father @entity158 's @entity299 and in a new twist @entity49 also alleged that his aunts and uncles arranged for a ' fake ' doctor to convince his grandmother to abandon plans to attend a concert , instead going to a luxury spa to rest			1
the court case was simply the latest twist in an ongoing sage which began when @entity7 left the house over a week ago , telling her grandchildren she was going to see her sons in concert			0
she did not return or contact her grandchildren			0
with a worried @entity51 tweeting that her grandmother was ' missing ' concerns arose that @entity7 had been ' kidnapped by her children ' , with her own lawyers even stating that this was the case			1
police stepped in and performed a welfare visit , with the 82 - year - old found to be in good spirits at her daughter @entity21 's house in @entity324			0
but she still failed to contact her young wards , with her son @entity19 admitting he had cut off her access to phones for her own ' well being '			0
@entity329 @entity331 scenes : @entity20 attempts to take @entity51 ' cell phone from her after storming the family home in a dispute said to have arisen over @entity158 's will on monday what 's at stake : a recent financial summary showed that @entity158 's estate has earned almost $ 500million in gross profits since his death , and many of his major debts have either been resolved or are no longer delinquent			1
key players : @entity2 prince @entity44 , @entity51 and @entity52 @entity20 , @entity215 , @entity21 and @entity347 @entity174 @entity348 on the fence @entity350 , son of @entity44 's brother @entity174 @entity352 , @entity353 's nephew			1
