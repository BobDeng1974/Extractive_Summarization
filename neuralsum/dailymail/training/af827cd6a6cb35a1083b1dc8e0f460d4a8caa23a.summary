@entity0 , 27 , is having his odd - shaped teeth fixed to cure his crippling back pain a man is having his wonky teeth fixed - to cure crippling back pain he has endured since childhood			1
@entity0 , 27 , of @entity7 , near @entity8 , @entity9 , has suffered bouts of sickening pain when he has been unable to get out of bed because of the agony in his back			1
now , he is having his odd - shaped teeth straightened by an expert who says they are to blame for an uneven chewing motion that results in painful neck and back distortion			1
mr @entity0 has been in constant pain since he was 12 years old and was forced to withdraw from school as the torment became unbearable			1
his pain has become even more acute in the last six years			2
despite numerous appointments with a range of medical experts , nobody could identify the cause of his problem			0
determined to end his misery , mr @entity0 conducted his own research and found that badly uneven teeth and a jarring chewing motion can cause severe tension on the skull , leading to pain in the neck and back			1
it then dawned on him that his shooting pains got worse every time he had a meal			0
he said : ' hard foods would be more painful than soft foods			0
' it does n't matter if it 's a piece of concrete or a grape , it 's the actual motion of bringing your teeth together			2
if you 've got a distortion when they come together , it will affect the rest of your body			0
' despite numerous appointments with a range of medical experts , nobody could identify the root of the problem after conventional medics ran out of ideas , he tried alternative therapies and found people with similar pain to him had been cured by getting their bad teeth mended through ' whole body dentistry '			2
the treatment involves adding overlays on to teeth to level them off , as well as using orthodontics to straighten teeth and ease pressure on the skull			2
the pioneer of the treatment is dr @entity76 , based in @entity77 , and two weeks ago mr @entity0 flew to @entity78 for the first of numerous treatments with him to level out his teeth			1
it has already cost him thousands of pounds but he hopes it will allow him to get his life back on track			0
he said : ' i would basically get my life back which feels like it 's been on hold for six years			0
just to get out of bed and not have the first thing in my mind : my back 's really painful			0
' i 've become used to it because it 's all i know			0
' after conventional medics ran out of ideas , he tried alternative therapies and found people with similar pain to him had been cured by getting their bad teeth mended through ' whole body dentistry ' mr @entity0 will return to @entity78 in early 2015 but is already feeling the benefit of his first session			1
he said : ' it 's not instantaneous but i can feel my bite is a lot better			0
' but my body has been in this position so long , it does n't just instantaneously change - it 'll slowly unwind			0
' dr @entity76 said he was confident mr @entity0 's life of pain will soon be resolved			1
he said : ' this innovative non-invasive technology has been successfully used to resolve many lower back pain problems like @entity0 's and in many cases helped patients avoid surgery			1
' last night , @entity119 - based dentistry expert @entity118 , president of the @entity121 branch of the @entity122 , said : ' there is a school of thought that poor jaw posture - because the teeth do n't meet properly - can have a knock - on effect , causing migranes , neck ache and back ache			1
