by @entity0 published : 11:46 est , 5 december 2012 updated : 13:56 est , 5 december 2012 a baby born with a swollen heart has made a miraculous recovery after having risky surgery			1
the valves in @entity7 ’s heart were so narrow that it caused severe pressure on the left side of his heart			1
his mother said doctors told her it had swollen to the size of a football			2
parents @entity18 and @entity20 , from @entity21 - under - @entity22 , @entity23 , were warned their newborn son would die unless he had an operation - but he could also die during surgery			1
his faulty heart valve was replaced with a pig 's heart valve now , after battling through six more operations to fix his heart , little @entity7 looks like any healthy three - year - old			1
full - time mother @entity18 , 22 , said : ' when doctors said his heart was the size of a football we could n’t understand			2
how was our tiny baby surviving with a heart that huge ? ' we were told we could either go ahead with the surgery or take him home to die			1
saying goodbye to our son was unthinkable so we agreed to the surgery			2
' @entity7 was whisked away so quickly that i felt like i did n’t have a son - the feeling haunted me for months			1
' i never even dreamed i ’d be choosing schools for my little boy			0
it ’s fantastic to see him living like any other three - year - old			0
' @entity18 ’s pregnancy had been normal up to 38 weeks when she went for her final check up			0
she collapsed in the midwife ’s office and started bleeding heavily			0
all grown up : @entity7 ( left ) with father @entity20 , mother @entity18 and sister @entity63			1
his mother said : ' we treasure every moment ' what a difference three years makes : mother @entity18 feared she would lose little @entity7 ( aged 3 months left ) , but he battled through surgery she said : ' at first the doctors tried to say it was normal but they soon realised it was serious and i had to go into labour			1
it took 13 hours and @entity7 was two weeks early but everything seemed fine			1
' back on the ward i realised straight away he was n’t moving and kept buzzing the nurses			0
they said he had a headache and was having trouble breathing			0
' they took him for x-rays and checks twice , and the third time he never came back			0
i did n’t know where my new son was from 3am to 9am			0
' when he got moved to intensive care it was petrifying			0
me and @entity20 were only young and had never seen anyone in intensive care before			0
we kept thinking ‘ why us ? ’ ' i had to watch other new mums taking photos of their kids and taking them home when i did n’t even know where mine was			0
' but all the hospital staff were incredible			0
in @entity97 , away from all our friends and family , they supported us the whole time			0
' the condition , called critical aortic stenosis , means the valve taking blood out of the heart is narrowed , affecting the flow of blood to the body and the circulation of oxygen to the brain			1
@entity7 as he was transported from @entity21 under @entity111 hospital to @entity112 precious bundle : first time @entity20 got to hold his son @entity7 @entity7 ’s cardiology consultant , dr @entity115 , said : ' @entity7 was born with a very critical aortic stenosis			1
it causes a severe impact on the pumping chamber and hence the body circulation is significantly compromised			0
' he had an emergency procedure at just 12 hours old and has since undergone a further three open heart surgeries			2
' we were initially concerned that his heart function would n’t recover fully however we are delighted that @entity7 ’s heart is now functioning much like any other child his age			1
' he does face further operations in the future , but we are all pleased with @entity7 ’s progress			1
' in may last year @entity7 had an operation to replace his valve with a pig ’s heart valve			1
@entity18 said : ' i do n’t really like the thought of @entity7 having an animal inside him but it ’s whatever it takes to keep him alive			1
' the new family together : @entity7 's parents have made a book for him to help him understand his heart condition father @entity20 , 25 , a fast food worker , added : “ it ’s a bit weird to think a pig is keeping your little boy alive			1
' the valve will need replacing as @entity7 gets older and grows so we tell him the scar on his chest is a zip so the doctors can get in and out easily			1
' the young parents have also made a book for @entity7 to help him understand his heart @entity156 said : ' it ’s hard to explain to a little boy why he has to go to hospital when his cousins and friends do n’t			1
' we ca n’t give him the book yet because he ’s at that age where he ’ll destroy it , but we show him and tell him about his heart problem all the time			2
' aortic stenosis is a heart defect that may be congenital ( present at birth ) or acquired ( develop later in life )			2
if the problem is congenital , then something occurred during the first eight weeks of pregnancy to affect the development of the aortic valve.the aortic valve is found between the left ventricle in the heart and the aorta - the largest artery in the body			2
it has three ' leaflets ' that function like a one - way door , allowing blood to flow forward into the aorta , but not backward into the left ventricle			0
aortic stenosis is the inability of the aortic valve to open completely			2
with aortic stenosis , problems with the aortic valve make it harder for the leaflets to open and permit blood to flow forward from the left ventricle to the aorta			0
this means it 's harder for the blood to flow through the valve and can cause the heart to enlarge			1
congenital aortic stenosis occurs in 4 to 6 per cent of all children with congenital heart disease and is three times more common in boys than girls			0
around one in 45 births is affected by a congenital heart condition			0
few children show symptoms during infancy , but problems tend to increase sharply in adulthood			0
@entity213 is a particularly special time for the family as @entity7 had his second operation on @entity216			1
@entity18 said : ' that first @entity213 was hard because we thought we ’d be at home with a happy , healthy baby by then - instead we were still back and forth to the hospital			0
' this year we plan to spend as much time as possible with all our families to make sure everyone gets to see @entity7 and his little sister @entity63 , who is seven months old			2
' we treasure every family moment because we know how close we were to losing @entity7			2
' now we ’ve stopped thinking ‘ why us ? ’ and started thinking how lucky we are that @entity7 is strong enough to keep going			2
' i know he ’ll face whatever comes his way with his cheeky smile			0

@entity7 *diagnosed* with faulty valve which made his heart swell
his parents were told he would die without an operation but could also die during surgery
surgery to replace the faulty valve with a pig 's valve was a *success*
