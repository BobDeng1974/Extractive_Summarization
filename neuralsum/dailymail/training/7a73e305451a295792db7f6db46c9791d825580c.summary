by @entity0 published : 12:36 est , 19 december 2012 updated : 12:37 est , 19 december 2012 the new iphone will run on @entity2 - and it has nothing to do with @entity4			2
a cheeky @entity6 technology company have made an attempt to cash in on the @entity4 gadget 's cult status by marketing their own version			1
and they have made a not too subtle attempt to circumvent the @entity15 firm 's copyright by swapping the original 's capital p for a lower case			0
the new iphone ... which runs on @entity2 : @entity6 company @entity19 have tried to cash in on the @entity4 gadget 's cult status with this cheekily named smartphone still , considering the legal crusade @entity4 launched against @entity25 for allegedly copying its designs for the @entity28 range of smartphones , it is likely that the lawyers are sharpening their swords			1
but , name aside , the new phone by @entity34 - based consumer electronics firm @entity19 is no @entity37 clone			1
it does n't come anywhere the specs of @entity4 's flagship gadget , nor does it look much like it 's namesake			2
dubbed the @entity19 iphone @entity44 , using a @entity43 processor it splashes @entity46 onto a rather paltry 3.7in capacitive touchscreen display			2
@entity48 to head : name aside , there are few similarities between the iphone and @entity4 's genuine article , right the dual - sim phone comes complete with two cameras , front and back , with 0.3 and 5 megapixels resolution respectively , but no flash - although if you live in sun - soaked @entity6 you might not need it			1
of course , @entity37 users feeling a sting of jealousy towards their @entity2 - wielding peers can always download @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , and now @entity70 , to get pretty much the same experience			0
perhaps the only good thing about the new iphone is the price			0
it retails 599 @entity76 - about £ 180 - and can be bought on an interest - free ten instalment plan			0
as far as @entity79 knows , there is no plan to market the phone outside of @entity6 .			0

@entity34 - based firm marketing phone with a subtly different name
but name aside there are few similarities with @entity4 's cult gadget
iphone *boasts* @entity93 processor and 3.7in touchscreen
