researchers have resurrected a 700 year old virus they discovered in caribou poo			1
the team say their would shows the potential for bringing back other viruses to study their biology and work out how to beat them			0
the new viruses are hundreds of years old , and one of them probably infected plants the caribous ate			1
700 year old frozen @entity15 excrement : a careful examination turned up two never - before - seen viruses which researchers were able to resurrect the authors isolated the complete genome of a dna virus from a 700 - year - old ice core layer that was distantly related to plant and fungi - infecting viruses , and a partial viral @entity25 genome that was related to an insect - infecting cripavirus			2
using a reverse genetics approach , the authors reconstituted the genome of the @entity21 virus to confirm whether the virus might infect plants			1
introduced it to @entity34 , a close relative of tobacco , where it successfully infected both new leaves and leaves inoculated with the virus the findings prove viruses can survive for surprisingly long periods of time in a cold environment , according to @entity45 , a researcher at @entity46 in @entity47			1
his team analyzed the viral genetic material contained in a core drilled through layers of accumulated caribou feces up to 4,000 years old in an ice patch in @entity56 ’s @entity55			2
@entity15 congregate on ice patches to escape insects and summer heat , and deposit feces containing partially digested plant material			0
the authors isolated the complete genome of a dna virus from a 700 - year - old ice core layer that was distantly related to plant and fungi - infecting viruses , and a partial viral @entity25 genome that was related to an insect - infecting cripavirus			0
the appearance of the viral material in the fecal samples suggests that the viruses may have originated in plants eaten by the caribou or flying insects attracted to the material			2
using a reverse genetics approach , the authors reconstituted the genome of the @entity21 virus to confirm whether the virus might infect plants			1
they then introduced it to @entity34 , a close relative of tobacco , where it successfully infected both new leaves and leaves inoculated with the virus @entity15 congregate on ice patches to escape insects and summer heat , and deposit feces containing partially digested plant material			1
plants inoculated with the ancient viral dna displayed evidence of infection including replication of viral dna in inoculated and newly emerging leaves			2
according to the authors , cryogenically preserved environmental samples may preserve ancient viral genetic material for present day study			0
' our finding indicates that cryogenically preserved materials can be repositories of ancient viral nucleic acids , which in turn allow molecular genetics to regenerate viruses to study their biology , ' the team wrote			0
using reverse genetics , the team reconstituted the @entity21 virus , which replicated and systemically spread in a model plant species			1
' knowledge of ancient viruses is limited due to their low concentration and poor preservation in ancient specimens			0
' using a viral particle - associated nucleic acid enrichment approach , we genetically characterized one complete dna and one partial @entity25 viral genome from a 700 - y - old fecal sample preserved in ice			0
' using reverse genetics , we reconstituted the @entity21 virus , which replicated and systemically spread in a model plant species			1
' under constant freezing conditions , encapsidated viral nucleic acids may therefore be preserved for centuries			0
' as @entity131 ice melts faster with climate change , it could release ancient viral particles into the environment — some of which could remain infectious , the team warns .			0

new viruses are hundreds of years old , and one of them probably infected plants the caribou ate
the researchers *reconstructed* the @entity21 virus
introduced it to @entity34 , a close relative of tobacco , where it successfully infected both new leaves and leaves inoculated with the virus
researchers warn virus could be resurrected after *thousands* of years
