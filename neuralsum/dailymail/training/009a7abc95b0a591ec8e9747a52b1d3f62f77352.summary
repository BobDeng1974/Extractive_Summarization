@entity1 television coverage of the @entity3 @entity2 — the most security - conscious race ever staged — could go blank moments before @entity7 arrives at the @entity8 on sunday			1
the @entity9 and @entity10 have been warned that @entity3 security forces will scramble radio frequencies to block any potential bomb being activated by these means			1
radio microphones and cameras would no longer be able to function , possibly putting both networks briefly off air			2
@entity9 ’s @entity20 editor @entity19 confirmed : ‘ the worst scenario would be if we are live and got no warning about when they will interfere with the frequencies			1
then we could go blank for a moment			0
but we have a contingency plan			0
we will have cameras that are not reliant on radio frequencies to take over and could go to tape instead			1
in another security measure , tv crews have been warned not to put their cameras too close to @entity7 as he accompanies his friend @entity32 and the @entity43 , who is here for talks , around this shiny new circuit on the @entity47 coast			1
@entity7 ’s lichniki — his guards from the @entity50 , an offshoot of the old @entity52 — will be poised to intervene			1
let ’s hope someone has told the not noticeably shy @entity55 , who will conduct the grid walk for the @entity9			1
security has been increased because of the war in @entity59 , and assassination fears are now greater than during the @entity61 here in february			1
so on the way into the circuit , there are armed guards and airport - style screening — rare for @entity20 if not most other global sports events			2
there will also be 500 @entity72 warriors protecting public order , 180 of them in the giant grandstand opposite the garages			0
these precautions add a faintly sinister dimension to a grand prix that already has been lent a maudlin air by last week ’s accident in @entity81 that has left @entity83 driver @entity82 clinging to life			0
@entity85 was fastest in the second session for this weekend 's inaugural @entity3 @entity2 @entity85 , 10 points ahead of @entity30 in the championship , topped the timesheets on friday afternoon @entity20 is making its inaugural foray into @entity3			1
@entity85 set the pace in the second session both team - mates at @entity83 and @entity93 , where he is on their young driver programme , are sleep - starved through anxiety			0
their desperation tells us that @entity20 ’s younger generation are not hardened to serious injury and death at the track			1
on friday , the @entity103 held a press conference in which @entity105 , the race director , defended the way he conducted the @entity81 @entity2 , in which @entity82 hit a tractor that was recovering another car			0
@entity105 did , however , highlight some areas that would be addressed by a powerful @entity103 safety commission : a possible speed limit during yellow - flag phases , a re-examination of whether canopies should be fitted to cockpits , a study of helmet strength , and a study into whether skirts should be fitted around tractors			0
ideally we should be talking about @entity85 versus @entity30 in the title fight , but @entity82 ’s plight and the political nature of the race make that impossible to do as freely as we would wish			0
@entity85 , who leads @entity30 by 10 points and led the practice times on friday , related the trauma of the last few days to his memories of his nine - year - old friend @entity129 , saying in his @entity9 column : ‘ even now , i can remember standing on the bank beside a track with him with our suits on just before a race , all laughing and joking			2
the next thing i knew i was at his funeral			0
it was the first time i ’d been to one			0
@entity20 driver @entity82 received urgent medical treatment after the crash but remains in hospital @entity20 chiefs are proposing a speed limit to slow down cars during dangerous situations on the track race director @entity105 says it would be best to give teams the ability to cut speed automatically ‘ it is very hard to put that out of my mind at the moment , after what happened to @entity82			1
but it does not make me rethink wanting to be a @entity20 driver			2
’ @entity105 discussed a number of his ideas with the drivers on friday and will talk to the teams collectively on saturday morning			0
however , no safety improvements will be introduced for this weekend ’s race — a vanity project for @entity7 , who has paid @entity32 in excess of £ 100million towards a seven - year contract for the privilege			1
the staging of the race scratches an old @entity173 itch			0
@entity174 , who drove at hell - raising speeds around @entity177 ’s quiet night - time streets in his fleet of cars that included his beloved @entity180 , tried to bring @entity20 here			1
his original idea was a track circling the @entity183			0
more than 30 years later the race has arrived			0
but should it be going ahead when , among other considerations , flight @entity186 came down at a spot in @entity59 only 320 north west of here ? it is a moral dilemma with which @entity20 has not over-exercised itself			1
then again , the @entity192 has not imposed sporting sanctions on @entity3 , a decision made by the @entity195 rather than @entity196			2
still , many of us will feel extremely uneasy watching president @entity7 playing politics in the paddock			2
@entity30 crosses the finish line during his session practice session ahead of the @entity3 @entity2 @entity204 , who drives for @entity205 , during his friday practice session at the picturesque @entity8 track			2
