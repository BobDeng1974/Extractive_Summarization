by @entity0 for @entity1 it beat ' twerking ' to be crowned word of the year by editors of the @entity5 and it seems that the power of the selfie shows no sign of abating thanks to image - conscious , social media - obsessed brits			2
so obsessed are we with capturing the perfect snap of ourselves that , according to new research , over 17 million selfies are uploaded every week on social media			0
and thanks to beautiful celebrities such as @entity19 and @entity20 constantly showing off their perfect faces we are always on the hunt for new ways to perfect our own shots			0
@entity42 has unveiled the @entity43 - their highest concentrated lipstick yet			1
available in 10 shades , the £ 7.50 lipstick is formulated with @entity32 ’s new exclusive @entity47 , which claims to give the wearer a ' highly pigmented bullet ' and a lipstick that ' explodes with bold , bright colour '			1
the team behind the new lipstick discovered that no matter how vivid and bold the colour , lipsticks are generally obscured in pictures by an opaque base ( the part of the formulation which carries the colour )			1
the team identified that in order to create ‘ true ’ colour , which best harnesses the pigment ’s potential , it was necessary to develop an entirely new base - one which is translucent - and the new product was born			1
lady in red : @entity69 loved the highly pigmented lipstick and will be wearing hers on saturday night for sure @entity72 , director of new product innovation at @entity74 said : ' we created @entity43 lipstick because we know women want deep bold colour to accentuate their lips and make them look their best in photos			2
' @entity82 , @entity32 ’s professional make - up artist , added : ' requests on how to create the perfect lip are high in demand this year and my top tip is that a bold lipstick can hide a multiple of sins			1
the high pigmentation in this draws attention to the mouth , a simple trick for an attention - grabbing look which does n’t require layers of contouring or smoky eyes			0
' i 've been using it whilst on @entity102 shoots			0
@entity103 and @entity104 in particular are excellent shades when trying to achieve this attention grabbing look			0
' with just one application the lipstick provides brilliant bold colour which lasts for hours			2
' verdict : @entity28 gave two of the new shades a spin and found that while they did enhance selfies , they were best saved for a night on the town rather than a day in the office			0
