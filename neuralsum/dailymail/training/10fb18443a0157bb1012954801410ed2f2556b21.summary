by @entity0 a photographer has captured an incredibly rare glimpse of one of the most secretive drone programmes on the planet			1
known as ' the @entity7 ' , the drone has already been tested in @entity8 , and can be easily spotted by its distinctive ' goldeneye ' glass , which shield 's the delicate sensing optics system			1
it can cruise at 400mph , fly up to 60,000 feet depending on the configuration and can stay airborne for over 18 hours			0
aviation photographer @entity33 caught quite the secret craft in action at @entity37 ' drone plant located in the @entity38			1
he was hoping to photograph a predator or @entity40 , but instead he caught one of the elusive test drones			1
@entity37 , which also makes nuclear reactors and maglev trains , already makes many of the most popular military drones , including the @entity39			1
the idea behind the @entity48 was to design an unmanned plane that had modular sensors , good performance , good stealth , and good payload , and could be used as a workhorse ' drone			1
the @entity7 will also be equipped with an electro - optical targeting system that will preserve its stealthy radar signature by placing the aircraft 's optics behind a series of gold plated , faceted windows			1
the firm is also believed to have tested the @entity7 with its new @entity64 , which features wrap around screens that repeat the video feed from a distributed camera system mounted around the @entity7			0
it is also rumored that the @entity7 is also being developed with a signals and communications intelligence payload for eavesdropping on the enemy , even while loitering over their own airspace			0
the @entity7 can house about 3,500 lbs of smart bombs , including small diameter bombs ( @entity77 ) that can glide over 50 miles from the @entity7 's height , and strike threatening enemy radar emitters as they pop up			0
the firm is also believed to have tested the @entity7 with its new @entity64 , which features wrap around screens that repeat the video feed from a distributed camera system mounted around the @entity7			0
the avenger is set to be a general purpose drone , and is believed to have already been used in @entity8			2
the @entity7 can stay airborne for over 18 hours , and possibly longer if fuel tanks are installed in its weapons bay			0
in december 2011 , the @entity89 announced that it had ordered an @entity7 and that it was being deployed to @entity8			0
' this aircraft will be used as a test asset and will provide a significantly increased weapons and sensors payload capacity on an aircraft that will be able to fly to targets much more rapidly than the @entity97 , ' the @entity89 said in an announcement			2
' since it has an internal weapons bay and four hardpoints on each wing it will also allow greater flexibility and will accommodate a large selection of next generation sensor and weapons payloads			0
' it can cruise at 400mph , and reach up to 60,000 feet depending on the configuration the @entity7 will also be equipped with an electro - optical targeting system that will preserve its stealthy radar signature by placing the aircraft 's optics behind a series of gold plated windows .			2
