almost a year after a blaze gutted the @entity5 's @entity4 , the architects who will lead the painstaking restoration of the library have been announced			1
@entity6 have been chosen from a shortlist of five firms who bid for the role earlier this month - and the design team will now begin working on a detailed plan for the restoration of the library			1
and these stark pictures show the mammoth task they face to restore the much - loved building , designed by @entity18 , to its former glory			2
the @entity21 - based architects were chosen thanks to their extensive track record in both restoring and reinvigorating major historic buildings - as well their work on buildings designed by @entity18			1
work is expected to begin in the spring of next year and it is hoped that students will have access to a fully - restored building from 2017 or 2018			1
there will be many fascinating questions to be addressed as we undertake this complex restoration project			0
' the team assembled by @entity6 impressed us not only with their deep knowledge of the building , but of the wider work of @entity18			2
' they also bring an understanding of the building 's particular importance to @entity21 – its people and history - as well as of its status as an international design icon			2
' he added the firm has ongoing relationships with key crafts specialists and artists in @entity68 and wider afield , and ' presented exciting proposals for expanding the legacy of the restoration by working with a new generation of creative talent '			0
prof @entity75 added : ' we are looking forward to working in partnership with @entity6 and the design team to explore how we can best meet the needs of the @entity5 in the 21st century whilst remaining true to @entity18 's astonishing vision			1
' the blaze began on may 23 last year after flammable spray foam for a student artwork was sucked into projector fan and caught alight the fire started in the basement , where undergraduate students were putting the finishing touches to their final year art show firefighters in breathing apparatus stood shoulder to shoulder to forming a human line between the inferno and the unaffected sections thousands of damaged pieces of building material have been marked in the hope that experts can put them back where they were before @entity102 , head of architecture at @entity6 , said : ' @entity6 are delighted to have won the commission to lead a team to restore the world - renowned @entity106 ' we have , over many years , had the privilege to work on and in the context of the @entity18 legacy , the highlight of which will now be the opportunity to bring the @entity5 into splendid re-use for its students and staff , the people of @entity21 and the huge audience beyond the city			1
' the company has worked across the spectrum of @entity18 's designs from the domestic , including the @entity5 itself and the former @entity126 offices , which is now @entity127			2
the @entity4 was damaged last year after a blaze sparked when canned spray foam , which a student was using for an art project , drifted into a projector fan and caught alight			1
the building caught fire on may 23 , starting in the basement , where undergraduate students were putting the finishing touches to their final year art show			2
blackened stones from the library 's walls have been numbered with chalk			0
the building is considered by critics as @entity18 's finest work firefighters were able to save irreplaceable paintings and furniture by @entity18 after curators showed them pictures and and told them where they could be found a student had been using highly flammable canned spray foam to fill in the gaps in a piece which involved three large sheets of thick foam , which formed three ' walls ' framing a fourth blank wall , onto which a digital projector was beaming images when the spraying took place			1
as the fumes from the spray foam spread around the room , they were sucked into the cooling fan of the projector and caught alight as they wafted over the heat of the circuit board			1
the fire engulfed the basement room and spread to destroy much of the iconic building 's west wing			0
witnesses described firefighters in breathing apparatus standing shoulder to shoulder , forming a human line between the inferno and the unaffected sections of the art school in a bid to prevent the blaze from spreading			0
other firefighters then darted in and out of the building to remove irreplaceable paintings and furniture by @entity18 after curators showed them pictures and and told them where they could be found			2
despite being insured for £ 50million , art school chiefs will receive much less because the east wing was almost completely untouched the art school is continuing its efforts to raise £ 20million to pay for the restoration of the building and its fire - damaged contents no one was injured in the fire , but there was extensive damage to the @entity208 library , the equivalent of @entity202 i listed in @entity209 no one was injured in the fire , but there was extensive damage to the @entity208 library , the equivalent of @entity202 i listed in @entity209 , which was described by critics as @entity21 - born architect @entity18 's greatest work			1
thousands of damaged pieces of building material , including blackened stones from the library walls , have been removed and numbered with chalk in the hope that experts can put them back exactly where they were before			0
after a six - month investigation , the incident was described as a tragic accident by the art school 's leaders			0
despite being insured for £ 50million , art school chiefs will receive nowhere near that amount , because the east wing was almost completely untouched by the fire			0
however , they have already received £ 5million from the @entity232 in @entity233 , £ 1million from fundraisers and another £ 1million in match funding from the @entity236			0
