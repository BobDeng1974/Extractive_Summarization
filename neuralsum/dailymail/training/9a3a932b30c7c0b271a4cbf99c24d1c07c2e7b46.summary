@entity1 's highest - up and most controversial roof garden has opened its doors on the 35th floor of the @entity5 skyscraper - but even @entity7 planners appear to be unimpressed with the final result			1
the @entity9 , which sits atop 20 @entity10 , promised to be the capital 's newest public park and was one of the reasons why the vast office block was allowed to be built on the edge of a conservation area			1
it was also expected to provide the best aerial view of @entity20 's capital city			0
@entity1 's highest - up - and most controversial - roof garden has opened its doors on the 35th floor of the @entity5 skyscraper the @entity9 , which sits atop 20 @entity10 , promised to be the capital 's newest public park but @entity7 planners have admitted that the hotly - anticipated garden , which opened its doors this week , is not ' quite what it was meant to be '			1
some have said the development , with its three exclusive restaurants , is n't actually a garden at all , but ' an observation deck with a few trees '			1
there has also been criticism levied at the ' public ' aspect of the space , after it emerged that only paying customers would be allowed up to the garden after 6pm			1
the furore will again highlight the controversy which surrounded the building of the £ 200m skyscraper , when developers were forced to go through a public inquiry , amid complaints the block would impede the view of @entity46 's			2
it will also be another blow for those who backed the building , following the episode last summer in which the concave top - shape of the building - the very feature which allowed the @entity9 to built - caused cars and businesses to melt beneath it			1
speaking after the garden 's opening , a source close to the planning department told the @entity62 : ' it 's still very much a live issue here			2
let 's say it is n't necessarily quite what it was meant to be			2
' but @entity7 planners have admitted that the hotly - anticipated garden is not ' quite what it was meant to be ' some have said the development , which has three exclusive restaurants , is n't actually a garden at all , but ' an observation deck with a few trees ' the three - storey space , designed by landscape practice @entity76 , has space for 400 diners , plus an extra 200 members of the public @entity82 , the @entity84 's former chief planner , added : ' i ca n't say that nothing has been compromised			1
' every building is a prototype , and things have to change as they go along			0
but it is n't a garden			2
' the three - storey space , designed by landscape practice @entity76 , boasts a @entity94 bar on the lower terrace , as well as the @entity97 brasserie and the ' refined dining experience ' of the @entity100 grill on the top level			0
in all , there 's room for 400 diners , plus an extra 200 members of the public			0
the criticism will again highlight the controversy which surrounded the building of the £ 200m skyscraper , when developers were forced to go through a public inquiry the building was given its nickname due to its unique concave shape , which means it is top - heavy those who would prefer just to check out the view can book to go up the tower for a one - and - a - half hour slot			0
the booking must be made online , three days in advance			0
but , after 6pm , only paying clientele from one of the three restaurants will be allowed up to the garden			1
one critic wrote : ' " public park " may be stretching it a bit			1
" observation deck with a few trees " might be a more accurate description			1
' not everyone has been impressed with the photos of the roof garden , which opened this week another person , responding to a photo posted online , tweeted : ' imagine it			0
you 've climbed to the top of the greasy pole and it 's not even as good as @entity143			2
' last year , the 37 - storey building was dubbed the @entity145 when it was found that the building was channelling the sun 's rays into a concentrated beam , melting vehicles parked on eastcheap			0
a two - storey scaffolding structure covered in netting was erected as a temporary solution			0
at the time , the architect behind the new building @entity156 said he predicted the exact scenario , but blamed the ' current elevation of the sun in the sky ' .			0

@entity9 at 20 @entity10 promised to be public park for @entity1
one of the reasons it was allowed to be built on edge of conservation area
but @entity7 planners have admitted garden is n't ' quite what it was meant to be '
space has three restaurants and is only open to paying clientele from 6pm
critics say it is ' an observation deck with a few trees ' and ' not as good as @entity143 '
