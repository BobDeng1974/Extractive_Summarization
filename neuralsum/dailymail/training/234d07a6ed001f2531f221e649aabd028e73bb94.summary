@entity0 admitted his @entity2 side could n’t get home quickly enough after a humiliating defeat by @entity5 in @entity6			1
and @entity8 cricket bosses in search of a blueprint to neuter @entity11 next summer and regain the @entity12 may decide to look no further than the slow , low surfaces served up for the @entity2 in the @entity14			1
having lost the first test in @entity16 by 221 runs , they surrendered the second by an eye - watering 356			1
it is the biggest margin of victory by runs in @entity5 ’s history – and the worst inflicted on the @entity2 for 34 years			1
@entity0 leads the @entity2 back on to the pitch after their demolition by @entity5 @entity0 ( left ) has admitted the @entity2 are glad to be leaving @entity6 after the shellacking 1 @entity27 124 points 2 @entity29 117 3 @entity5 105 4 @entity30 104 5 @entity31 101 6 @entity32 96 7 @entity33 93 8 @entity34 75 9 @entity35 39 10 @entity36 19 whichever way you spin it , the chances are you ’ll end up confusing an @entity2 batsman			1
‘ the players will be happy we ’re going home to play in conditions we ’re accustomed to , ’ said a shell - shocked @entity0			1
‘ we ’ve got to talk about what ’s just happened			0
’ the result , which lifts @entity5 up to third in the @entity49 rankings – one place above @entity30 – means @entity29 have now lost 10 of their 14 tests away from home since the start of 2013 , including last year ’s double whammy of 4 - 0 in @entity32 and 3 - 0 in @entity30			1
and while @entity30 are in no position to gloat following their capitulation to @entity11 a year ago , they will have noted with interest the @entity2 ’ renewed struggles against spin			2
‘ i was hopeful we ’d learned some of the lessons from @entity32 , but it does n’t look that way , ’ said @entity0			0
‘ the best teams win away from home consistently			0
it shows we ’ve got a lot of work still to do			0
we ’re a lot more comfortable playing in our own back yard			0
’ @entity0 walks from the ground after being bowled by @entity73 ( not pictured ) @entity74 ( third right , on his knees ) celebrates after taking a catch to dismiss @entity77 and seal victory umpire @entity79 avoids being hit by the ball and bails as the ball crashes into the stumps first test ( @entity84 ) - 8 – 12 july @entity86 ( lord 's ) - 16 – 20 july @entity87 ( @entity88 ) - 29 july – 2 august @entity89 ( @entity90 ) - 6 – 10 august @entity91 ( @entity92 ) - 20 – 24 august if @entity30 do decide their best hope of a fourth successive home ashes win next summer lies in encouraging groundsmen at @entity84 , lord ’s , @entity88 , @entity90 and the @entity92 to produce turning tracks , it will shock no one at all			1
their victory over the @entity2 in 2013 centred on @entity103 ’s series haul of 26 wickets on pitches left deliberately dry			2
the policy had its drawbacks			0
confronted by a rampant @entity11 on @entity29 ’s bouncier tracks three months later , @entity30 wilted hopelessly , and lost 5 - 0			1
but coach @entity109 and captain @entity110 may feel emboldened by the progress made by @entity113 ’s off - spin during the 3 - 1 win against @entity32			0
having begun the summer derided as a part - timer , he ended up taking 19 cheap wickets against a team with a reputation for devouring slow bowlers			0
@entity5 spin twins @entity121 ( left ) and @entity73 celebrate with the trophy after their 2 - 0 series win @entity124 hits a boundary off @entity126 on his way to the joint fastest test century of all time the success of @entity5 ’s inexperienced spin attack in the @entity14 will do little to dissuade them			1
@entity121 , a leg - spinner playing in his first @entity49 series , finished with 12 wickets at 17 , while @entity73 , a slow left - armer who had previously played only two tests , managed 14 at 26			2
@entity77 – @entity29 ’s frontline spinner – managed three wickets at 140			0
just as relevant was @entity11 ’s modest series haul of six			2
@entity5 ’s cherry on the top was captain @entity124 ’s 56 - ball century on sunday , equalling @entity143 ’s test record			2
for the time being , at least , @entity29 look a rabble .			0

@entity0 admits @entity29 could *n't* wait to get home from @entity6
@entity5 won second test by 356 runs to *clinch* 2 - 0 series victory
@entity29 have lost 10 of 13 away test matches since start of 2013
slow , low pitches can neuter threat of @entity11
