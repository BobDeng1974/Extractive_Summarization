by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter one of the two @entity4 aides revealed in a newly - released report to have been romantically involved leading up to last year 's traffic closures is fighting back			1
the lawyer for @entity8 , who infamously sent an email saying ' time for some traffic problems in @entity11 ' , and whose judgement was called into question after a failed relationship @entity16 former campaign manager @entity15 , slammed the findings of the @entity19 inquiry			1
attorney @entity20 said in a statement to the @entity22 that ' the report 's venomous , gratuitous , and inappropriate sexist remarks concerning ms. @entity8 have no place in what is alleged to be a professional and independent report			1
' under examination : @entity8 , the @entity4 aide who sent the infamous ' time for some traffic problems in @entity11 ' email , was reportedly dating one of her colleagues for months before the scandal close : @entity15 ( left ) was @entity4 's campaign manager until april when he stepped down and @entity8 took over the report released by a law firm @entity4 hired to investigate the scandal , said that the two had been a couple for months but had called things off a month before the @entity41 lane closures			1
@entity42 called the report ' a preemptive strike ' meant to ' isolate ms @entity8 and impugn her credibility , ' ' ms. @entity8 is not a liar , ' the statement continued			2
' she is a single mother of four children who was deeply devoted and committed to her job at the @entity50			0
' she worked tirelessly to pursue the goals of the @entity50 during her tenure			0
' @entity15 , 36 , worked as the @entity56 governor 's deputy chief of staff and then when he left the post in april to become @entity4 's campaign manager , he was replaced by @entity8 , 41			1
' at some point after @entity15 ’s departure to run the campaign , @entity8 and @entity15 became personally involved , although , by early august 2013 , their personal relationship had cooled , apparently at @entity15 ’s choice , and they largely stopped speaking , ' the report by @entity60 states			1
' because @entity15 was her " benefactor , " @entity8 relied heavily on him during this transition ' ahead of their august break up			1
the report also concluded that the governor was not involved in a plot to create gridlock near a major bridge as part of a political retribution scheme			0
the taxpayer - funded report released by @entity60 , a former federal prosecutor , relies on interviews with @entity4 and other officials in his administration and 250,000 documents , many of them emails and text messages			2
@entity4 's government funded lawyer claims the @entity89 governor had nothing to do with the @entity41 scandal ' we found that governor @entity4 had no knowledge beforehand of this @entity41 realignment idea , ' @entity60 said at a news conference			2
his report comes out ahead of any results from independent investigations by federal prosecutors and a special committee of state lawmakers			2
some of the key figures would not cooperate with @entity60 's investigation , leading @entity104 to question the credibility of the report and its thoroughness			0
@entity108 on investigation co-chair @entity109 released a statement effectively calling the report an attempt by @entity4 to move past the issue without critically examining the scandal			2
' lawyers hired by and paid by the @entity4 administration itself to investigate the governor ’s office who then say the governor and most of his office did nothing wrong will not be the final word on this matter , ' he said in a statement			0
during a media conference call thursday , @entity109 said that the mention of @entity8 and @entity15 's romantic entanglements was ' irrelevant ' especially because neither were interviewed for the report so there was no clear connection between their love life and the lane closures			1
' it is very difficult to tell who is telling the truth when you do n't hear from both sides , ' he said			0
' it reads more like a novel than a work of fact			0
' defending the report at a news conference thursday , @entity60 said , ' we believe we have gotten to the truth or we would n't be reporting it			0
' the september closure of lanes near the bridge that caused four days of massive gridlock in the community of @entity11 have become a major scandal for @entity4 , a possible 2016 @entity56 presidential contender			2
@entity4 said on a radio show wednesday that the events will not affect his decisions about his political future			0
in his view : governor @entity4 's office hired @entity60 , a former federal prosecutor , to investigate the scandal and the report released thursday declares clears @entity4 of wrongdoing the lawyer hired by @entity89 gov. @entity4 to review a traffic - blocking scandal that has engulfed @entity4 's administration released this report which a published report said clears the governor of any role in the plot the report , issued at @entity60 's @entity177 law office , concludes that former @entity178 and @entity89 official @entity179 and @entity180 aide @entity8 were behind the closures and that they were targeting @entity11 mayor @entity182			1
but it did not conclude why they wanted to hurt the @entity185 and said there was no evidence that it was because he refused to endorse @entity4 for re-election last year			0
@entity60 says that @entity8 , who did not cooperate with the report , tried to cover her tracks when @entity4 began asking what happened last year by asking a colleague to delete an email about the plot but the other staffer retained the email anyway , the report says			1
@entity60 also says that @entity179 suggested he mentioned traffic issues in @entity11 to @entity4 at public event during the lane realignment			1
@entity179 says @entity4 did not recall it being brought up and if it was , it would not have registered as significant to @entity4 — something @entity4 has said before			0
the report also finds that a claim by @entity208 mayor @entity207 , that @entity4 's administration told her that @entity210 would be tied to a private redevelopment plan , is ' demonstrably false '			2
a spokesman for @entity207 did not immediately return a call			0
@entity60 calls for @entity4 's office staffers to cease using personal email accounts for official business , eliminating the office where @entity8 had worked and appointing an ethics officer in the governor 's office			1
he also recommends major changes to the structure of @entity178 , an agency jointly run by the states of @entity177 and @entity89 .			0
