the gay prostitute who had sexual encounters with @entity2 says the family of slain bride @entity4 treated him like a long - lost son when he met them as the 34 - year - old millionaire faced a murder charge over the death of his wife			1
@entity11 , @entity14 ' the @entity13 master ' , from @entity15 , met @entity18 's parents @entity16 and @entity19 in @entity20 , @entity21			1
prosecutors claimed @entity2 ordered a hit on @entity4 because he was gay and wanted a way to get out of his marriage without shaming his family			1
@entity11 , @entity14 ' the @entity13 master ' , met @entity18 's parents @entity16 and @entity19 in @entity20 , as @entity2 faced a murder charge over the death of his 28 - year - old @entity30 wife grieving : @entity31 and @entity19 with a photograph of their daughter on her wedding day			1
they met mr @entity11 in the @entity37 during the trial in october @entity2 , who was cleared of plotting the murder last week and has now returned to the @entity40 , admitted he was ‘ bisexual ’ in a three - sentence statement read to the @entity43 , as a series of witnesses - including mr @entity11 - prepared to testify he was gay			1
mr @entity11 , 43 , admitted he was nervous about meeting the family in october , fearing they would judge him for how he makes his living			1
he told the @entity49 : ' i was apprehensive to meet them because of the line of business i am in and because of the nature in which i met @entity2			1
' i was apprehensive and thought they would see me as a dirty , disgusting man			1
but it was the opposite			1
they were so grateful i had come forward			1
@entity2 was cleared of plotting the murder of his wife @entity4 last week and has now returned to the @entity40 ' i was welcomed like a long lost son , in a way			1
it was surreal , sitting in a chair , surrounded by her family and them treating me like they ’d known me for years			1
' @entity4 ’s uncle @entity69 said : ' we have got nothing against homosexuality or what he does or that he is a prostitute			2
' he is still a human being and we ’re grateful for what he did for us			2
' after graduating , @entity2 trained as an accountant and worked for @entity77 before joining his brother in the family business as a financial director			1
by his early 20s , he had joined a gay dating website called @entity82 , using the name ‘ asiansubguy ’ – thought to be a reference to the fact that he liked to be submissive during sex with men			2
and he became a regular at the notorious hoist nightclub in @entity92			2
yet his strict family and religious background meant he kept the truth about his sexuality secret			1
there was also , increasingly , pressure on him from his parents to get married , particularly after @entity100 , his elder brother , settled down			2
@entity2 struggled in relationships with women			2
in 2008 , he was introduced to a tycoon ’s daughter called @entity106			2
they were engaged within three months , but split up soon afterwards			2
three months after that relationship collapsed @entity2 was introduced to @entity109 , a @entity30 engineering graduate , whose family had fled @entity111 during @entity113 ’s bloody rule , and built up a business and a new life four hours from @entity116			1
on a visit to see her cousin , @entity118 , in @entity119 in 2009 , she was introduced to @entity2 by mutual friends			2
the pair continued to see each other , spending alternate weekends in @entity124 and @entity116			2
@entity2 proposed to @entity4 at the @entity125 with a £ 25,000 diamond ring after flying his girlfriend out from @entity92 by private jet in 2010			2
behind the scenes , however , the relationship was in turmoil			0
@entity2 and @entity4 rowed repeatedly and , it is claimed , broke up several times during their 18 - month courtship because of his ‘ controlling ’ behaviour and lack of sexual interest in her			0
@entity11 pictured shopping in @entity20 after giving evidence in the @entity2 trial in october her cousin @entity142 , who was close to @entity4 , said : ‘ @entity4 felt embarrassed and hurt , and we both felt it was weird			1
@entity4 and i speculated that maybe he was a virgin or perhaps just being proper			0
’ mrs @entity142 added that @entity2 was always ‘ very critical ’ of @entity4 ’s appearance			0
@entity4 even broke off their engagement at one point			0
but mr @entity69 says @entity2 ’s father phoned him and pleaded that @entity4 could ‘ not do this ’ as it would bring the @entity2 family ’s reputation ‘ down to earth ’ if he had a second failed engagement			1
so mr @entity2 instructed his eldest son @entity157 to get @entity2 to be more affectionate , and @entity4 finally agreed to marry him , despite significant ‘ misgivings ’			1
throughout their relationship , he had begun secretly meeting mr @entity11			1
@entity4 and @entity2 ’s rows continued			0
even as they planned the wedding in @entity165 , they argued over the colour of decorations , the theme for functions and the style of clothing			0
at one point , @entity4 texted her cousin : ‘ fighting a lot with @entity2			0
wish i never got engaged			0
everyone tells me how fortunate i am … absolutely sick			0
’ @entity2 had begun secretly meeting @entity11 , even after he started going out with @entity4 ( pictured ) yet when the £ 200,000 wedding finally did go ahead at the five - star @entity177 set on the banks of @entity180 , there were few public signs of tensions as 300 guests watched @entity2 and @entity4 dance to the hit @entity186 song @entity185 – @entity188			1
but after they went to the honeymoon suite , there was little romance			0
@entity2 scolded @entity4 for not folding her clothes and spent the night on the sofa , their marriage un-consummated			0
‘ @entity199 has become my new hobby , ’ @entity4 told a friend in one text			0
she also told friends she was already considering divorce before they left for their fateful honeymoon in @entity21			0
@entity4 ’s father , @entity31 , said when he last spoke to her by phone on the afternoon of november 13 she said she had a ‘ lot to tell him ’ and needed to speak to him when she returned the following tuesday			0
later that night , @entity4 was shot dead after their car was hijacked in a township outside @entity20 , apparently on a sight - seeing tour because , according to @entity2 , she wanted to see ‘ the real @entity21 ’			0
hours after her body was found , police found @entity2 had logged on to @entity82 , the gay dating site , from the luxury hotel where they had been staying in @entity20			0
@entity69 , the uncle of @entity4 , told the @entity218 : ‘ we could n’t care less if someone is gay or not			0
‘ but @entity2 was determined to marry a beautiful heterosexual girl			0
whatever else happened , by marrying her knowing that he was gay , he had already ruined her life			0
for that we can never forgive him			0

@entity11 , 43 , admitted he was nervous about meeting the family
but he said they were welcoming and treated him like a ' long lost son '
he said : ' it was surreal *...* them treating me like they ’d known me for years '
