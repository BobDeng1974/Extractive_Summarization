@entity34 - it 's difficult to imagine a world where @entity34 is not undefeated			1

@entity34 can keep her unbeaten @entity13 record going unless her attention is taken by acting 2			1
@entity54 - at this point in his career , having capped off two victories over @entity51 with an impeccable title defense over @entity53 at @entity13 , there 's no denying how good @entity13 middleweight kingpin @entity54 truly is			1

@entity125 â€“ the @entity13 lightweight @entity125 has come out of nowhere			1
unranked and undefeated , the @entity126 is quietly flying under the radar coming into his fight with @entity129 at @entity13 on @entity130			2
but with versatile striking , knockout power and budding grappling skills , @entity125 will ultimately force his way into the limelight			2
@entity125 has come from nowhere to take the @entity13 lightweight division by storm 6			1
@entity139 - it 's unlikely that she has what it takes to defeat champion @entity34			1
even with the best power punching in the women 's bantamweight division , the confident @entity142 has struggled to maintain the composure and patience it would take to win the title			0
her resume certainly commands respect , but it only took @entity34 16 seconds in a recent title defense opposite @entity154 to beat a contender with the same 9 - 0 record			2
@entity142 @entity139 ( left ) packs a powerful punch but still might not be strong enough for @entity34 7			1
@entity9 - even with a record of 11 - 0 ( 4 - 0 in the @entity13 ) , rising welterweight @entity17 has yet to earn undivided respect			1
due in part to his inability to capture a @entity37 finish thus far , the wrestling - based 31 - year - old needs to show a little ' flair ' to make noise in a talent - rich division			0
but with an excellent ground game and budding striking skills , the @entity170 slightly resembles a less accomplished @entity54			2
the jury is still out over @entity17 , especially since he has not managed an @entity37 finish so far in his career			0

@entity9 faces @entity12 at @entity13 @entity177 on saturday
rising welterweight star @entity17 is undefeated in 11 fights
