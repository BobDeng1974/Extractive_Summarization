by @entity0 published : 17:00 est , 16 february 2013 updated : 09:24 est , 17 february 2013 @entity2 ’ role as @entity3 in the @entity5 films brought the actor vast wealth			1
and he spent lavishly : he had a penchant for fast cars and bought properties all over the world			0
but unlike his fellow goon @entity12 , who was educated at @entity13 , @entity2 , the son of variety entertainers , did not enjoy a privileged childhood			1
one of his first homes was in @entity19 , @entity20 , a modest early 19th century two - up , two - down terrace that is currently on the market			1
inspector 's pad : the @entity26 family outside their terrace house in @entity19 , @entity20 where @entity2 grew up the house is priced at £ 645,000			1
that might seem steep outside the capital , but it is rare for a house in this desirable area to sell for less than £ 1 million			2
sellers , who suffered from depression and alcohol problems later in life , never seemed to find happiness in his grander homes , but he appeared to retain great affection for the house where he lived between the ages of ten and 14			1
his actor friend @entity46 recalls @entity2 stopping his brand - new @entity47 outside the @entity19 house shortly before his death in 1980			1
@entity46 remembered : ‘ he just put his head on the steering wheel and cried , “ whatever happened to @entity2 ? ” ’ the vendors of the house , @entity55 and @entity26 , will certainly leave behind happy memories			2
their daughters – @entity58 , seven , and @entity59 , four – were both born after they bought the house in 2003			0
selling @entity2 ' : the living room in the two - up two - down property which is on the market for £ 645,000 the family are moving for the simple reason that they need more space , though there is more now than when @entity2 lived in the property			1
civil servant @entity55 and @entity26 , who works in the @entity70 , paid £ 275,000 for the house and spent £ 20,000 renovating it			2
they later added a kitchen extension			0
growing up : @entity2 , who lived in the house as a boy , as @entity3 in 1963 film @entity5 while the rooms are still fairly small , the downstairs space – which comprises a reception room , dining room , kitchen - diner and bathroom – is well organised and has plenty of light			1
upstairs , however , you get an impression of how cramped the house would have been in @entity2 ’ day			2
at the top of the stairs is a tiny landing and two modest bedrooms			0
‘ the house had been used as an office before we moved in , ’ says @entity97 ‘ there was no central heating and the floors on the second storey were badly warped			0
’ the couple knocked down the old galley kitchen and built the stylish new extension but lost space from the already small garden at the back			0
however , they have no regrets about this , as the vast spaces of @entity112 and @entity113 are just over the road			0
the @entity115 concede there is no scope for further expansion – there is no loft or basement – and they believe they would not get planning permission to put another room above the kitchen			0
the couple say many people , on seeing the @entity128 plaque on the front of the house commemorating @entity2 , stop and take pictures			2
with its fine restaurants , green spaces and lofty views over @entity20 , @entity19 continues to attract celebrities – @entity137 and @entity138 both have houses there – and the @entity115 believe theirs would suit a young professional couple looking for these qualities , as well as efficient transport into @entity144			1
but when children arrive , as the @entity115 have discovered , the house may prove a tad too small			0
