senior doctors have expressed outrage at an @entity3 's plans to move a unit which treats vulnerable children to just metres away from a paedophile therapy centre			1
the @entity7 , currently located in @entity8 in @entity9 , north @entity10 , treats children up to the age of 16 with mental health problems including specialist services for those who have suffered trauma or have special educational needs			1
but @entity19 and @entity20 is giving serious consideration to building a new unit for the children in the gardens of the nearby @entity25 , the @entity18 reports			1
hospital bosses are considering relocating this children 's unit in north @entity10 to within a few metres of a clinic which treats paedophiles it is one of the only places in the country where paedophiles can receive treatment on the @entity3			1
patients , who refer themselves voluntarily , are given ' forensic psychotherapy ' in a bid to restrict their urges			0
the possible relocation of the children 's unit has been met with disbelief by some clinicians			2
one therapist , who asked not to be named , told the @entity18 : ' this is very disturbing indeed â€“ it is tantamount to trying to treat alcoholics in a brewery			1
' the therapist claimed that the move is particularly dangerous because group therapy sessions for paedophiles are held in a room which looks out directly into the garden			2
the source claimed that paedophiles could potentially be asked to talk about their fantasies while children are running around just metres away			2
however this claim has been denied by the trust which insists the new unit would be self - contained and there would be no direct access from the @entity25			2
@entity65 , a former consultant psychotherapist and former chair of the @entity25 , was among those to express concern			0
the proposed new location is to the rear of the @entity25 which is part of this hospital in @entity10 he said moving the unit into the @entity25 gardens could ' unwittingly put children at risk '			1
the @entity3 's chief executive dr @entity77 said the plans to move the unit had not yet been finalised , but insisted the proposed new site would not put children at risk			1
a spokesman for the @entity3 said : ' we would , of course , do nothing that endangered or disturbed our patients and we take our responsibilities very seriously			0
' our record for safety and quality has been acknowledged over many years by a wide range of official inspectors as well as by the health and local authorities which commission our services , and by our patients themselves			0
' all the patients that we see here are living and being treated within the community			0
we have robust safeguarding and reporting measures , and work closely with partner organisations , to ensure the safe management of all our patients in the community			0
the @entity25 has a long , established history of successful treatment with its patients that attend the clinic			2
' we fully risk - assess every activity that takes place in the @entity3 and as part of our planning we have conducted a full risk assessment on the potential new build			1
' we do not currently perceive this potential move to pose any significant risk to anyone that we see			0
' we have safely managed children , adult and forensic services for many years and will continue to do so			0
both the @entity7 , the @entity125 and the @entity25 have their own rigorous internalsafeguarding policies and procedures and we would expect , as with any other matters , any concerns			0
