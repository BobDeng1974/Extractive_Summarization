on a day of fireworks off the pitch as the row over end of season championship scheduling exploded , @entity1 fans let themselves down by setting off flares in the @entity8			1
as the smoke cleared on this 1 - 1 draw against bottom side @entity12 , though , @entity9 was left ruing the explosive impact of @entity15 despite his @entity17 side nudging one point clear of @entity19 in second place			1
the @entity23 attacker ’s absolute cracker of a free - kick had sent the home side into the lead just two minutes after the break			1
@entity15 ’s joy was to be short - lived , though , as @entity1 centre - half @entity29 raced up the park to restore parity with a clever back - header two minutes later			1
@entity1 dropped two points at @entity35 bottom side @entity12 in their bid for promotion @entity12 : @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 ( @entity46 86 ) , @entity47 , @entity48 ( @entity49 89 ) , @entity50 ( @entity51 81 )			1

@entity1 : @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity29 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 ( @entity64 80 ) , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 ( @entity68 74 ) , @entity69 ( @entity70 74 )			1
subs not used : @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75			0
referee : @entity78 ( @entity79 )			0
but despite leapfrogging @entity19 to go second , there was no mistaking @entity9 ’s expression at full - time			1
to the manager , this was two points lost as @entity1 ’ form away from @entity17 once again gave them cause for concern			2
that ’s just one win away from home in the last five @entity93 games now , as the tense race to finish second — and avoid the third / fourth play - off games — hots up ahead of the final three matches			0
to be fair to @entity9 , he had pinpointed this clash against a resurgent @entity23 as one of the toughest matches his side would face before the end of the regular league season			1
the @entity1 boss made just the one change from the side that beat @entity106 4 - 0 at the weekend			1
there was a return to centre - half for captain @entity60 , free from suspension after serving his two - game ban for an elbow on @entity114 striker @entity113			2
the captain ’s recall saw @entity59 move to right back , with @entity74 dropping onto the bench			0
@entity12 , on a run of three straight wins , made just the one change , @entity46 dropping out while the veteran @entity121 was included to pack the home midfield			2
@entity15 gave @entity12 the lead early in the second half and threatened to upset @entity1 @entity15 curled a free - kick into the back of the @entity1 net to give @entity12 the lead in the 47th minute after a series of loud bangs rang out across the stadium , the game exploded into real controversy after seven minutes			1
@entity12 striker @entity48 challenged @entity1 goalkeeper @entity58 in the air and @entity15 turned the loose ball home			1
as he raced away in glee , the @entity1 players , not to mention @entity9 in the dugout , looked grateful as the flag of assistant referee @entity141 halted the home celebrations			1
the @entity12 players , and fans , meanwhile , reacted furiously			2
there had seemed little wrong with @entity48 ’s challenge on the keeper			0
@entity1 were struggling to impose themselves as an attacking force , against a side that looked nothing like relegation contenders			2
the best @entity9 ’s men could muster early on was a header over the bar from @entity69 after a cross from the right wing by @entity62			2
the @entity158 then saw a long - ranger effort comfortably saved by @entity38 in the home goal			0
but shortly afterwards , @entity62 looked fortunate to escape punishment when he appeared to catch @entity23 ’s @entity42 in the face with his arm			0
referee @entity78 had spotted the off - the - ball incident but he elected to award a foul to @entity23 but took no action against the @entity158 , to the visible disgust of some @entity12 players			2
@entity43 sent the free - kick over the bar			0
five minutes before the break , @entity67 sent a 16 - yard shot flying over the bar when he really should have tested goalkeeper @entity38			2
in the second half more booms erupted in the @entity1 end but they were stunned into silence as the dangerous @entity50 gave @entity12 a lead with a terrific goal			1
@entity59 fouled @entity48 at the edge of the box and @entity15 stepped up to curl a stylish and superb free - kick beyond the diving @entity58 to leave @entity1 players and their fans staring at a damaging defeat			1
@entity29 equalised a couple of minutes later for @entity1 at the @entity8 @entity1 were unable to force a second goal and get the win , but still leapfrogged @entity19 in the table but @entity9 ’s men showed the kind of mettle that has been missing for most of this season when they drew level within 120 seconds			1
@entity62 sent in a free - kick from the left and there was @entity29 to get in position to flick a backwards header beyond the diving @entity38			2
as @entity1 searched for a winner , @entity59 fired in a powerful shot from the right wing that @entity38 uncomfortably palmed away			0
and @entity1 thought they had gone ahead when @entity66 fed @entity67 on the right , and he cut the ball back for @entity62			0
but the @entity207 loan star ’s shot cracked the inside of the post before being scrambled away to safety			0
@entity1 survived a scare at the other end when @entity58 slipped but the goalkeeper recovered before @entity48 could take advantage of his fall			0
and the @entity23 fans were furious when @entity29 appeared to foul @entity217 in the box , only for referee @entity78 to wave play on			0
@entity9 went for it , sending on @entity68 and young @entity70 for front two @entity67 and @entity69 while @entity221 replaced @entity220			0
but his replacements made no impact and @entity1 were unable to carve out any more opportunities			0
at the death , @entity62 was booked for simulation in the box as he desperately claimed a penalty			0
there was still time for yet another ear - shattering explosion from the @entity1 end			1
but the booms were soon replaced by boos at the full - time whistle as @entity1 had stuttered once more on the road			1
@entity23 , for their part , were afforded a rapturous reception from their own band of fans as @entity241 ’s men moved to within two points of second - bottom @entity243 .			0

@entity1 held to 1 - 1 draw by bottom side in the championship
@entity9 *'s* side go second in the league above @entity19
@entity15 gave @entity12 the lead just after half - time
@entity29 equalised for @entity1 two minutes later
