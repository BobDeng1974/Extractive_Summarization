grandmother - of - four @entity0 , 65 , died of lung cancer two years after doctors failed to spot the mass in a chest x-ray a grandmother died from lung cancer after doctors failed to spot it on an x-ray two years before she was diagnosed			1
@entity0 , 65 , went to hospital in july 2011 for a double knee replacement due to rheumatoid arthritis but because she complained of pains in her chest , staff also carried out x-rays			1
mrs @entity0 was told by staff at @entity17 , @entity18 , that her lungs were clear - but tests almost two years later revealed she was suffering from lung cancer			1
the cancer , which was visible in the original x-ray , had spread to her spine and she died in july last year			1
her husband of 47 years @entity26 , from @entity27 , @entity28 , instructed specialist medical negligence lawyers to investigate her care			1
mr @entity31 , who has four sons and four grandchildren , said : ' the past year has been so difficult			0
we were distraught when we found out that @entity35 had lung cancer and were so shocked and upset when we found out it should have been diagnosed two years before she died			1
' you put your trust in doctors to find out what is wrong and provide treatment to the best of their ability but @entity47 was sadly let down			0
the worst thing for us is that they did the necessary tests but failed to analyse them properly allowing her cancer to spread			2
' he added : ' she was very strong willed and refused to be beaten by the cancer even though deep - down we knew it was terminal			2
' three of our sons live in @entity62 and flew back to see her in the final months and we have all been left devastated by our loss			0
' nothing can bring her back to us but we wanted answers as to how this could happen and hopefully through taking legal action it will make people sit up and take notice and make sure that changes are made to stop this from happening again			0
' i would hate for others to go through what we have			0
' the hospital also carried out its own @entity78 investigation which revealed that staff had made errors with her diagnosis			1
the report , by @entity83 , made several recommendations of actions that should be taken to improve care and patient safety			2
it revealed that had the lung cancer been spotted in 2011 , she would have undergone treatment and it would most likely have not spread to her spine			1
mrs @entity0 had gone to @entity17 for knee replacement surgery in 2011 but after she complained of pains in her chest , doctors carried out the x-ray - but failed to spot the cancerous mass the @entity99 has now admitted that it failed to spot and diagnose her cancerous mass in 2011 and apologised for the errors in mrs @entity0 's care in a letter to lawyers			1
@entity105 , representing the family , said : ' this is an extremely tragic case as it is clear from the evidence that had the mass been identified on the original x-rays , mrs @entity0 could have received appropriate treatment for her cancer and it may not have then spread to her spine which ultimately led to her death			1
' the family were naturally devastated by her death and the circumstances surrounding the spread of her illness and wanted answers as to how this situation could happen			0
' there are serious patient safety issues involved in this case and the family wants assurances that the recommendations in the @entity78 report have been fully carried out to prevent others from suffering in future			0
it is vital that the @entity99 learns lessons from this case			2
' @entity0 with husband of 47 years @entity26			1
he said : ' i would hate for others to go through what we have ' between the original x-rays in july 2011 and throughout 2012 , mrs @entity0 had returned to hospital for follow up treatment for her knees and although she had no further chest pain , she did complain of fatigue			1
she was given steroids and advised that the tiredness was caused by her arthritis			0
on 21 april 2013 mrs @entity0 was referred from @entity146 for a chest x-ray due to a suspected infection and further investigations discovered a large mass on the left side of her chest			1
a scan identified cancer in the lung which had spread to her spine			0
it was then that the original x-ray on 19 july 2011 was revisited and the cancerous mass clearly noticeable			1
mrs @entity0 underwent radiotherapy but died in july last year - two years after being told there was nothing to worry about on her lungs			1
family doctors are failing to spot lung cancer until it is too late - with a third of patients diagnosed with the condition just 90 days before death			2
and for one in 20 people with lung cancer , researchers discovered the disease is discovered only after they have died			0
even when patients had visited their gp repeatedly in the months before their death , lung cancer had often gone unnoticed			0
@entity179 are often confusing the signs of cancer with things like a smoker ’s cough and failing to commission an x-ray			2
more than 35,000 people die of lung cancer in @entity188 each year , with just nine per cent surviving for more than five years with the disease			2
respiratory physician dr @entity190 found that those who died within three months had seen their gp an average five times before they finally received a diagnosis			2
her team at @entity194 analysed a sample 20,140 cases of lung cancer seen at 440 gp surgeries between 2000 and 2013			0
their research , published in the @entity201 journal @entity202 , established that 30 per cent of lung cancer patients died within three months of a diagnosis			0
she said : ‘ lung cancer can be difficult for doctors to distinguish from other lung diseases so we need to give them some tools that will help identify a patient as high risk			0
‘ if we can diagnose patients at an earlier stage hopefully they can get curable treatment rather than palliative treatment which is what most patients are getting at the moment			0
‘ it ’s not that we ’re trying to blame the @entity179 but if we have tools to identify these high risk people earlier than we should put them to use			0

@entity0 , 65 , went to hospital in 2011 for knee replacement surgery
but due to pains in her chest , staff at @entity17 did an x-ray
