by @entity0 last updated at 11:18 pm on 27th february 2012 @entity2 conspired to cover up the true extent of phone hacking at the @entity5 , it was claimed at the @entity7 inquiry today			1
former deputy prime minister @entity8 accused police of a ' conspiracy of silence to hide the facts '			1
in a sworn witness statement , he suggested they withheld information after repeatedly telling him they had no evidence his voicemail was illegally accessed			0
it was not until last year that @entity2 finally admitted that his aide @entity33 's messages may have been targeted			0
the @entity36 peer has since agreed a Â£ 40,000 payout from the @entity5 for phone hacking			1
and on a dramatic day , @entity20 , a former acting assistant commissioner , said it was possible evidence could be ' covered up ' , in his own sworn statement			2
questioned : @entity27 was asked in 2006 why he had the mobile phone number and pin for @entity8 's chief of staff in documents mr @entity20 said he ' found it difficult ' to have ' confidence ' in current investigations			1
he suggested that the phone hacking probe should be led by another police force			1
in his statement , he said : ' i find it difficult to have confidence in the current investigations , despite having the utmost respect for the senior investigating officer , @entity55 , since the police are investigating themselves and are relying on the voluntary co-operation of @entity58 in order to make progress			0
' ' it leaves open the possibility that should evidence severely damaging to both the reputation of the @entity23 and @entity58 be discovered , such as the collusion of very senior officers or those at the highest levels in @entity58 , it could be covered up to the benefit of both parties			2
' mr @entity20 , who retired from the police in 2007 and is now a @entity73 politician who wants to be mayor of @entity75 , added : ' it is essential , in my view , that independent scrutiny and oversight of the investigation is introduced or that the investigation is led by a police force not so far implicated in the current investigations			2
' the inquiry learnt @entity27 , a private investigator working for the @entity5 , was asked as early as august 2006 why he had documents containing a mobile phone number and pin for @entity8 's chief of staff			2
a @entity2 detective asked him : ' another page here , this has got the name @entity8			2
there is another name underneath , first of all it says adviser and then the name @entity33 ... have you got that information to access @entity8 's network or that of his adviser ? ' @entity27 replied : ' no comment			0
' despite this , when the @entity36 politician asked the @entity23 in 2009 whether his mobile had been hacked he was told there was no evidence this was the case			0
lord @entity8 suggested police had withheld information from him			1
he pointed out that he had regular dealings with former senior @entity23 officer @entity109 , who was in ultimate charge of the original phone hacking investigation in 2006			1
' he ( mr @entity109 ) was the man i was working with , and he might have just said to me , " watch your phone " , he said			0
' i was beginning to feel they were hiding things , not telling me the truth			0
' referring to the police , the former deputy prime minister added : ' these are highly - paid , highly - intelligent people			0
' i think there was more a conspiracy of silence to hide the facts and frankly i am stronger of that view in the last few months			1
' @entity27 and the @entity5 's royal editor , @entity126 , were jailed in january 2007 after pleading guilty to intercepting voicemail messages left on royal aides ' phones			0
lord @entity8 also criticised the close relations between @entity132 politicians and @entity58 owner @entity133 and his executives			1
he said : ' it 's not exactly corruption , and i 'm not accusing them of that , but they do have interests , they do have power			0
' and in the @entity133 press , it 's particularly organised to achieve that , so they have good relations			1
' referring to mr @entity133 , he added : ' he 's not interested in the dinners , is he ? he just wants what he wants - that is selling newspapers and influence over political parties and playing a part in influencing the politics			0
