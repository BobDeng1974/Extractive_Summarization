on paper it looks like the holy trinity of an attacking midfield , but @entity5 's decision to play @entity6 and @entity7 either side of @entity9 on monday night may not be one he makes again			1
despite 90 minutes of nail - biting action , the first 30 minutes were most telling , and set the tone for the remainder of the game while summing up @entity15 's season so far			2
@entity16 dominated @entity15 for the opening period , leading the game at the half - hour mark and leading every physical battle to boot			1
more heat maps and @entity22 from @entity24 's @entity23 @entity7 started on the left wing for @entity15 , providing the assist for @entity27 @entity28 caused problems on the left , and often moved infield to penetrate @entity16 's defence part of the problem was the load on midfielder @entity36 as @entity15 attempted to spring forward using the three - pronged attacking midfield of @entity6 , @entity9 and @entity28			1
@entity6 , starting his first game under @entity40 and not known for his defensive capabilities , was cemented to the right wing for the first - half , moving slightly inward in the second - half as @entity15 improved ever so slightly			1
@entity9 , playing in the absence of the suspended @entity46 , saw very little of the ball throughout , and was bypassed by @entity15 's deeper midfielders and defence			2
more heat maps and @entity22 from @entity24 's @entity23 @entity9 started in the middle of the three - pronged attacking midfield at the @entity52 @entity9 spent much of the first - half helping @entity6 on the right of midfield , and struggled to impact on the opposite wing @entity28 was not an individual problem			1
in fact the @entity58 was superb again , providing the assist for @entity27 's equaliser and delivering several dangerous balls having found himself in space			0
he did exactly what @entity6 did n't when ' stuck out ' on the wing - making use of the situation to full effect - with the @entity69 picking up a 5.5/10 rating @entity70			2
@entity28 at least attempted to move in and penetrate the penalty area more than once , as shown in his heat map			0
@entity9 , meanwhile , is an ongoing dilemma - a Â£ 37.5million midfielder without a defined place in @entity40 's system to justify the price tag - and it showed again at the @entity52			1
more heat maps and @entity22 from @entity24 's @entity23 @entity6 , on his first start for @entity15 under @entity40 , hardly had an effect on the game on the right wing the @entity69 hugged the right wing for @entity15 , and his delivery into the box was often poor the only man directly between @entity9 and goal , striker @entity87 , was given no support by the @entity90 and nothing to feed off			1
the two played too far apart , forcing ( or enabling , @entity40 would argue ) @entity15 to use the flanks even more			2
too wide and not clinical enough , @entity15 were stretched			2
space behind the striker that @entity46 would often fill was vacant , meaning @entity15 struggled to win the ball high up the pitch			0
@entity16 's only roadblock to goal when winning the ball in midfield was an out - of - position @entity102 and an exposed @entity103			0
the @entity105 trio made just one tackle between them , compared to five by @entity16 's attacking midfield three of @entity108 , @entity109 and @entity110			0
it was no surprise both goals came on the break with the trio chasing shadows , and the second goal in particular cut through the heart of @entity15 , as can be seen below			0
more heat maps and @entity22 from @entity24 's @entity23 @entity16 's second goal , scored by @entity119 ( 18 ) came from @entity15 being cut right down the middle @entity27 was brought on for the second half and had a big impact on the match , scoring the equaliser @entity125 was often playing off the last @entity16 man , but @entity9 struggled to connect with him @entity40 got his tactics wrong at 8pm , but the game quickly changed complexion after the first - half			1
as is not often the case , there were n't too many question marks over @entity27 's introduction at the expense of @entity102 at half - time , giving @entity103 more physical support			0
it worked in an attacking sense , too			0
@entity15 finally had some control going forward , but none when tracking back			0
two goals each was a rather predictable scoreline			0
@entity119 celebrates putting @entity16 ahead in the second half at the @entity52 @entity5 's side looked better attacking than defending , and not for the first time this season			1

@entity5 played @entity6 to the right and @entity7 to the left of @entity9 in the 2 - 2 draw at the @entity52
@entity28 was superb with his delivery and utilised the wing , but both @entity6 and @entity9 failed to have an impact
@entity15 were stretched and too wide , putting *pressure* on @entity36 and the defence in the first - half as @entity16 dominated
@entity6 was starting his first game for @entity15 under @entity40
@entity9 also struggled to connect with @entity15 striker @entity87
