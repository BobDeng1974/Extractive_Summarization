by @entity0 follow @ @ oliver_todd @entity1 right back @entity2 has hit out at @entity3 - calling the @entity6 pundit 's comments about the @entity9 hosts ' striker @entity7 : ' idiotic '			1
former @entity10 striker @entity3 told @entity11 last week that @entity13 first choice centre forward was slow , can not shoot and should be replaced in the @entity14 despite having a good scoring record for @entity13 over the last year , @entity15 forward @entity7 is not known for his mobility and drew a blank in @entity13 's first two games , a 3 - 1 win over @entity22 and a 0 - 0 draw with @entity24			1
' he does n't move , he does n't shoot and he 's dragging the team down			1
' i do n't know if @entity13 should change the system or play @entity42 as a false nine , but the fact is that @entity7 is not the answer for what they are doing now			2
' and @entity3 's comments appear to have riled the @entity13 squad with @entity2 hitting back in support of his international team - mate on saturday , saying a former professional should know better than to criticise			1
' those comments are some of the most idiotic that anyone can ever say , ' @entity2 told reporters at @entity13 's base camp just outside @entity56			2
' someone who played football , who knows how difficult it is to be a football player , how difficult it is to beat opponents , compete , score goals - it 's a shame for football and a lack of respect for his colleagues that play the game			0
it 's something to be ashamed of			0
' misfiring : @entity7 had a good @entity72 but has struggled to light up the @entity9 frustration : @entity7 is yet to score in this summer 's tournament and has only had one shot on goal over two games struggle : @entity13 's number nine has the tough task of leading the line for the under - pressure host nation @entity13 sit top of @entity83 ahead of their final group game against @entity86 , with the team that tops the group to face either @entity89 or the @entity90 in the last 16			1
the @entity14 have been criticised in the media for their lacklustre performances so far - they required a soft penalty to give them the lead against @entity22 - and @entity2 expressed concern at what he said might be unreal expectations			0
' fans want to the team to win , scoring five , 10 goals so when we do n't manage that they read things very differently from us , because they act with emotion and we act with a bit more criteria			0
' we think that our fans have created a huge amount of expectation in the team and we are clearly working to provide answers to those expectations			0
' people are normally very pessimistic and they 're tremendously negative , but we need to stay faithful and defend the work we 're doing , which i think is very well done			0
' different : @entity3 touted using @entity42 as a false nine rather than starting @entity7 up front respected : @entity3 is a staple of the @entity6 's punditry , seen here with @entity118 and @entity119			2

@entity13 right back defends his team - mate who has failed to find the target
@entity3 said @entity7 ' does n't move ' and is ' dragging the team down '
@entity2 states *disbelief* that a former pro would criticise @entity13 's no.9
