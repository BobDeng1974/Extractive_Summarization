by @entity0 at this time of year , my skin is as grey as the rain - leaden skies			1
@entity4 has come and gone , leaving me with a deathly pallor and ghoulish under - eye bags			2
this is the season when a good facial really can make all the difference			2
i want to recapture that lost summer glow			2
i want my eye bags to melt away			2
i want my face to be de-puffed - in short , i want to get back the will to live			0
i 'm not looking to be pampered , just for down - and - dirty instant gratification			0
dna facials : no - fuss @entity16 is ' all about the results ' there is only one place to go			1
the place where i return year after year , like a slightly weather - beaten homing pigeon			0
up a rather dingy flight of stairs , past magazine racks stuffed with browning back - copies of @entity26 ! and whingeing hairdresser 's assistants , past the tiny toilet - and into the three - room skincare empire of @entity16			1
@entity30 does n't have much time for small - talk			0
it 's 8.15am , and i 'm the first client of her day , a day that wo n't end until gone 9pm			1
she does n't bother much with glamour , either			0
no scented candles or wafty whale music in her treatment rooms , just an array of serious - looking machinery , winking ominously in the wintry gloom			1
@entity0 : ' she shrunk my chins ! ' her hair is tied tightly back , her sleeves are rolled up and she 's scrubbing her hands			1
do i need to remove my top ? ' up to you , ' she says , as she flicks a few switches and the machines hum into life			0
' ready ? ' and off we go			0
@entity30 is what 's known in the business as a ' superfacialist '			1
she 's not here to make me feel good , to chat or to de-stress me			1
she is here to perform my annual skin mot			1
she calls it her dna facial , not because it contains any deoxyribonucleic acid , but because it goes to the core of each client 's individual needs			1
she is , as she likes to remind me when i grimace at the sight of another torturous - looking contraption , ' all about the results '			0
her knowledge is based on years of experience - she has worked with both @entity70 ( the flamboyant former dancer - turned - @entity72 - skin guru ) and dr @entity74 ( one of @entity76 's most trusted skin doctors )			1
she knows what works and what does n't , what ’s harmless and what 's not			1
and it 's best not to argue with her			1
she begins with a @entity82 , which combines glycol and lactic acids to exfoliate , brighten and hydrate the skin , followed by targeted hydrodermabrasion ( basically deep exfoliation using water ) , again to cleanse and hydrate			1
the next bit , however , is a little scary			0
radio frequency for my jawline			1
my double chin and incipient jowls are one of the things that depress me most about my reflection			0
this treatment involves massaging the offending areas with a rather hot nozzle			1
this , apparently , zaps fatty deposits and tightens the skin			1
it 's also quite uncomfortable - although not impossibly so			1
afterwards , there 's some lymph drainage using a funny little sucking device , then some extremely firm ( ' i do n't do namby - pamby ' ) and rather heavenly massage using a masque by a @entity108 skincare brand called @entity112 ( www.evalmont.com )			1
all that , and i 'm still not done			0
time for some red light therapy to stimulate cell regeneration , and then a final once - over with a @entity112 serum and @entity118 cream			0
i sit up , slightly stunned			0
but best of all my double chin has shrunk			0
reader , she shrunk my chins ! @entity16 is at @entity126 's , 020 7349 8722 how do we know it 's nearly @entity129 ? the rosy cheeks of the children as they play in the chill november air ? the little robin redbreast busying himself in the garden ? or even the pre-order facility for the @entity137 at @entity138 ? nope			1
it 's the absolute cast - iron guarantee that , around about now , a bunch of half - naked women will start appearing on our screens , chained to snow leopards , snogging wolves or dragging their fingernails down the backs of unsuspecting male models while @entity150 - or someone who sounds a lot like him - mutters inanities in a comedy @entity155 accent			2
a little bit of genius : @entity159 and @entity160 yes , viewers : it 's @entity129 perfume ad season ! @entity163 has already brought out the big guns : they 've got @entity165 , a wise back - to - basics move after last year 's disastrous @entity168 venture			2
but look , here 's @entity170 , overtaking on the inside with an original short film directed by none other than @entity174			2
in moody black and white , and set in @entity176 , it stars two of the most beautiful people on the planet , @entity160 and @entity159			0
it 's a little bit of genius , actually			2
not only does it contain flashes of humour ( not generally present in the world of haute perfumery ) , it has a perfectly plausible narrative - and at no point do either of the protagonists ’ clothes accidentally fall off			0
best of all , there are no endangered species , no women covered in gold paint wandering through the snow			0
the closest they get to a clinch is holding hands			0
does it reflect the fragrance itself ? mmm , not exactly			0
it 's one of those rather banal , black - curranty affairs that fashion houses seem to favour at the moment , nothing special , and unlikely to become a classic			2
but the point of a designer fragrance is not what it smells like ; it 's what it stands for			2
driving through @entity176 in an open - top car with @entity160 ? what more could a girl want for @entity129 ?			0
