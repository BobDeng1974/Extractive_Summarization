@entity0 has called for cricket authorities and helmet manufacturers to continue to work tirelessly on player safety following the tragic death of @entity5			1
a sombre - looking @entity0 made his plea in @entity7 the day after the @entity9 batsman died from a blow to an unprotected part of his head , below the left ear , which he received during a domestic match in @entity15 on tuesday			1
the @entity17 squad joined in with a @entity19 - led initiative , hashtagged ‘ putoutyourbats ’ , in honour of @entity5			1
they lined up their bats after a training session at the @entity25 ahead of this morning ’s second one - day international against @entity26 , and placed one navy blue test cap on each handle			1
‘ this is a reminder to everyone that we ca n’t take anything for granted			0
we ’ve got to keep improving player safety , even though improvements since i started playing cricket have gone through the roof , especially with helmets			1
’ helmet safety has been a pressing issue in the game ever since 2008 , when the @entity33 ’s injury surveillance programme looked into head injuries incurred by batsmen wearing helmets			2
of 35 verifiable incidents around the world between 2003 and 2012 , six batsmen were struck on the back of the helmet , and two more — like @entity5 — on the unguarded part of the neck or lower head			2
most helmet safety tests have focused on preventing the ball from penetrating the gap between the helmet ’s peak and its grille , or ensuring the grille does n’t impact on the face after being struck by the ball			0
but @entity82 have launched an investigation into player safety , while @entity26 ’s veteran batsman @entity85 told @entity86 : ‘ the helmet should be longer at the back to protect vital areas of the head and balance both freedom of movement and safety			1
it needs to be as safe as possible			0
i ’m sure the @entity94 as a governing body can step in to ensure safer equipment standards			0
’ @entity85 said he had spent time looking online at protective headgear in other sports , including @entity100			0

reasons for this vary : the older models tend to be lighter , while the players believe they offer better visibility			0
they may even feel more comfortable in a helmet they have worn for longer			0
privately , some within the @entity17 camp are also concerned that extending the helmet to cover sensitive areas at the back of the head would curtail their freedom of movement			2
@entity17 and @entity26 discussed postponing today ’s match — the second in a series of seven — but @entity0 said : ‘ we thought showing respect and playing the game in his honour was the right thing to do			1
’ the @entity17 squad have , understandably , found it tough to focus on cricket since news came through that @entity5 had died , and @entity0 admitted that today ’s game would inevitably be played at a lower level of intensity			1
but he insisted it would be wrong for fast bowlers to hold back on bouncers in the wake of the short ball delivered to @entity5 by @entity155 seamer @entity154			2
‘ this is a tragic accident , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ i do n’t think we should change the way cricket is played			2
if you ’re going to play a game , you ’ve got to do it properly			0
what ’s happened in the last three days has certainly clarified in my mind that it ’s just a game of sport			0

we play it hard , yes , because you ’re representing your country , but there ’s certainly a right way to do it			0
’ @entity178 captain @entity195 said he and his team had been ‘ deeply shocked ’ by @entity5 ’s death			2
‘ it was the first thing i heard when i woke up yesterday			0
it was a very tough day , ’ he said			0
‘ it will be very hard to get over this — for all of us , not just @entity9 cricket			2
he was a humble guy and a gentleman			0
