by @entity0 published : 18:43 est , 3 april 2012 updated : 04:36 est , 4 april 2012 a @entity2 's campaign offering to ‘ feed your family for £ 50 a week ’ has been banned for misleading shoppers			1
the high - profile adverts claimed a family of four would be able to eat three healthy meals a day on a recession - busting budget			1
but customers complained that the meal plans did not provide sufficient calories , meaning additional food would have to be bought			1
under fire : the supermarket giant has been told it was in breach of rules with its ' misleading ' advertisements they said the weekly cost did not include a number of ‘ store cupboard ’ ingredients that had to be purchased separately			1
they were also concerned that a warning that the weekly plans were not suitable for children under four was buried in the terms and conditions			2
the @entity31 has now ruled that the supermarket was in breach of rules including those covering misleading advertising , substantiation and prices			1
the watchdog said that the tv , press and online adverts must not be used again in their current form			2
the decision is an embarrassment for @entity2 ’s at a time when it is fighting to erode @entity48 ’s dominance as the country ’s number one supermarket			1
an @entity31 spokesman said : ‘ because the ads claimed that readers could meet all their family food needs for a week for £ 50 , when that was not the case , we concluded that @entity2 ’s had over-claimed and that the ads were misleading on this point			1
‘ the published meal plans also listed store cupboard ingredients which were not included in the headline price of £ 50 , such as olive oil , dried mixed herbs , fresh garlic , mustard , tomato puree , stock cubes and plain flour			0
‘ we understood that a significant number of consumers would have to buy ingredients in addition to those listed on the meal plans , bringing the cost above £ 50			0
‘ because we considered that the ads implied the advertised meals plans were suitable for children under four years of age when that was not the case , and because we understood that customers with children under four would therefore have to alter the meal plans and buy additional food for that age group , we concluded that the ad was misleading			1
’ the campaign ran throughout may and june last year and followed the company ’s @entity91 - led ‘ feed your family for a fiver ’ adverts , which started in 2008			0
adverts included pictures of three meals with the words : ‘ 28 breakfasts , 28 lunches , 28 dinners , 1 happy family			0
’ shoppers were urged to ‘ follow our meal plan , three meals a day , seven days a week ’			0
celebrity endorsement : chef @entity91 has backed a previous @entity2 's campaign challenging shoppers to feed their family for fiver but food experts voiced concerns about the plans , which worked out at 60p per meal per person			1
the average prison meal costs £ 2.10			0
toast and sandwiches featured heavily , including three breakfasts of toast and jam in one weekly plan			0
they said the meals provided only around 1,600 calories a day			2
other warnings included a lack of fruit and the poor nutritional balance of some meals			0
defending the campaign yesterday , @entity2 ’s said the meals were not intended to provide all the calories needed every day and were supposed to be supplemented by drinks and snacks			1
but nutritionist @entity138 branded the meal plans irresponsible			0
‘ if you did n’t read the terms and conditions you would end up losing weight , which can have a dangerous impact on your health if you ’re healthy or underweight , ’ she said			0
‘ it also increases the risk from some underlying health conditions			0
men are meant to have around 2,500 calories , so it ’s 1,000 calories less than they should be having , which is equivalent to losing 2lb a week			2
that is at the top end of weight loss recommendations			0
’ @entity2 ’s said it had developed the meals with the @entity157 and there had been only six complaints out of four million customers who became involved with the initiative			1
it declined to say whether it would run the campaign again , although the meal plans were still available online yesterday			0
a spokesman added : ‘ we are surprised and disappointed that the @entity31 has come to this judgment as it does not reflect the feedback we have had from our customers			1
‘ our “ feed your family for £ 50 ” campaign has been very popular and resonated with customers who clearly understood that a small handful of ingredients in the meals plans would have come from their store cupboards			2
‘ we worked closely with independent experts and still believe that our meal plans provide nutritious and tasty family meals in a cost - effective way			2

customers claimed supermarket 's claim did not provide sufficient calories
@entity31 ruled @entity2 's was in breach of advertising rules
