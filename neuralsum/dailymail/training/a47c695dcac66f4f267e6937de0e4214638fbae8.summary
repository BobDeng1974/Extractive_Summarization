by @entity0 published : 21:13 est , 13 march 2013 updated : 07:04 est , 14 march 2013 a bagpiper nearly died after becoming infected with a fungal pneumonia that colonised inside his beloved instrument			1
@entity4 spent four weeks in hospital fighting the infection after he breathed in germs from his bagpipe that he had n't cleaned in 18 months			1
medics provided antibiotics but were unable to diagnose the 77 - year - old 's health problems			2
it was n't until they pressed mr @entity4 on his hobbies that they were able to identify germs in the musical instrument as the cause			1
deadly : @entity4 , 78 , of @entity19 , @entity20 , contracted a life - threatening fungal infection after the germs grew inside his beloved bagpipe the @entity24 - based in @entity25 - has now warned pipers to be aware of the dangers of not cleaning their bagpipes properly			1
mr @entity4 - a former committee member of the @entity29 in the @entity30 - was preparing to play at a special event in september when he fell ill during a fishing trip			1
he was forced to return to his home south of the border in @entity19 where his gp prescribed antibiotics			0
the retired food company manager was then admitted to @entity37 but sent home two days later - only to be re-admitted after a week when his condition worsened			0
he said : ' i was extremely tired and slowly fading away and my consultant told me it was life - threatening			0
' i became very much weaker and it was obvious to my consultant and my son that they were dealing with a life - or - death situation			0
' mr @entity4 's son was asked to bring his father 's bagpipes into the hospital for tests where pathologists discovered a heavy growth of fungal cultures			1
they included the @entity58 and @entity59 species , which can cause infections that kill half of the people stricken by them			0
traditional bagpipes are made of hide and need regular ' seasoning ' to seal pores in the skin that acts as a natural cleanser			1
bags made from man - made materials are supposed to have reduced the need for such frequent upkeep - synthetic bags usually come with a zipper on the side to allow access for cleaning			0
lucky to be alive : mr @entity4 was admitted to @entity37 with fungal pneumonia and finally released after four weeks of treatment the piper said he was preparing for an important performance and did n't want to tamper with his pipes as they were ' going well ' and so he had neglected to clean them for a year and a half			1
he also said he had just recovered from a previous illness that may have weakened his immune system before the spores entered his lungs			0
despite his month - long hospital stay , mr @entity4 has taken up the pipes again but admitted he makes sure he cleans his instrument regularly			1
he added : ' i am now back playing but it is taking some time to develop the stamina of old			2
' @entity95 , principal of the @entity25 - based @entity24 , said he had never heard of bagpipes causing such a serious illness before			2
he said : ' it 's very important that all pipers make sure they sterilise their pipe bag regularly			0
with the advent of synthetic bags , this maintenance is even more essential			0
' according to the @entity105 , there are at least 7,000 bagpipers in @entity107 alone , with thousands more around the world			0
different types of bagpipes are found in many cultures , and some form of the instrument is believed to have been played in the @entity114 as long ago as 1000 bc.			2

@entity4 , 77 , breathed in the deadly germs while playing his bagpipes
the instrument had n't been cleaned in 18 months and had ' fungal cultures '
traditional bagpipes need regular ' seasoning ' to seal pores in the skin
mr @entity4 is now playing his bagpipes again after four weeks in hospital
