his lengthy court fight with third wife princess @entity14 , 50 - who was previously married to a minor @entity16 prince and is herself distantly related to the @entity5 royal family - has been excruciatingly embarrassing			1

so he must have heaved a huge sigh of relief on friday when a @entity28 court made its final decision on the case behind closed doors			0
and although the payout is a @entity51 record , and five times an earlier settlement made in @entity28 before it was appealed , many commentators believe the @entity1 has got off lightly			1

the couple had a son , but after six years announced their separation			0
in the course of their highly publicised break - up it has been claimed that the estranged wife hired surveillance experts to prove her belief that her husband was having an affair			0
there have more recently been reports that the @entity1 is considering marrying for a third time			0
when the @entity118 finally approved a secret agreement between the couple on friday , lawyers for both side refused to comment on the reputed £ 50 payout for the princess			1
