@entity6 @entity5 was sent to the scene of the horrific accident in october 2007 where he found little @entity9 trapped under the wheels of her family 's one tonne car			1
the toddler - who was just two at the time - had suffered horrific crush injuries after the handbrake was left off and the car rolled back over her			1
my hero : @entity9 , eight , with pc @entity5 , 42			1

paramedics battled to save her and she was transferred to hospital where @entity34 was tasked with telling parents @entity35 , 31 , and @entity37 , 34 , to expect the worst			2
she spent days in intensive care on a life support machine but miraculously fought back and spent a week defying the odds slowly recovering from her injuries			2
@entity42 was assigned as the family liaison officer to @entity9 's parents as she struggled back to health			1
@entity9 with her mother @entity46 and pc @entity5			1
he became their family liaison officer after the accident during that time he ferried the worried couple back and forth to @entity52 and offered them support and advice			1

@entity24 - who has worked for @entity74 for 19 years - said : ' seeing @entity9 on life support and hearing cherished memories from her mum and dad was the most painful thing i 've experienced in nearly 20 years as a police officer			1
' i had two young children myself and i could n't imagine what they were going through			0
' the following morning , as doctors prepared to switch off her machine , she showed signs of life and started breathing for herself ; she steadily improved and as the family 's @entity89 i stayed in touch every day to watch @entity9 's incredible recovery			2
' as a liaison officer i 'm there to help the family through their ordeal , but naturally after six months or so you step away and leave the family to re-build their lives			0
' but this was different			0
you do n't expect a little girl who is technically dead to make such a recovery			0
' how do you cope with something like that and walk away ? ' when the investigation finished i became a family friend and have stayed in touch ever since			0
' she is an amazing girl and every time i see her it is just great , she is so full of life			0
' the bond myself and @entity9 have developed over the years in unreal			2
' every time i visit , she runs up to hug me and stays hugging me until i leave			0
i am truly honoured to be @entity64			0

he helped us at our worst and i could never thank him enough ' mother @entity35 said she asked @entity24 if he 'd do the honour of being her @entity124 four years ago on @entity9 's advice			2
she said : ' @entity5 has been a part of @entity9 's life since the accident ; the bond they have is unbelievable and nothing can break it			1
' i 'm delighted to have @entity5 part of our family he was the obvious choice as @entity124			2
' he was the person there on the scene , there with us through the recovery , none of us drive so he was there to take all of us too and from hospital			0
' i know it is his job to help us but it was more than that , he really cared , you do n't expect that humanity from a police officer			1
' since then he has always been there for us , coming to see @entity9 on his days off , she always demands a picture with him when he comes round			2
' @entity9 still suffers some hearing , speech and movement difficulties as a result of her brain being starved of oxygen after the accident she added : ' she is his world and it 's great he agreed to be her godfather			1
' the support and help he offered was beyond belief			0
he helped us at our worst and i could never thank him enough			0
' @entity9 loves him and there is no - one i would rather have as godfather			1
now they will be able to keep their bond going in the years to come			0
' when it happened i was just a mess , i was in complete shock , i just told myself to carry on for @entity9 and then got on with it , convincing myself she would be ok			2
' they told us she would n't live , but she did , and it was n't until she got home that it all really hit me			0
' @entity9 still suffers some hearing , speech and movement difficulties as a result of her brain being starved of oxygen after the accident			1
at the time @entity9 's grandad @entity191 , 58 , described @entity42 as a ' rock ' for the family			2
