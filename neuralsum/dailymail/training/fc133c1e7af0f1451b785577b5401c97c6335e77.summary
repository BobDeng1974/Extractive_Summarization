by @entity0 , @entity1 editor police are under pressure to question the multi-millionaire founder of @entity5 , @entity4 , over his role in the decision to send bogus legal letters to thousands of customers police are under pressure to question the multi-millionaire founder of @entity5 , @entity4 , over his role in the decision to send bogus legal letters to thousands of customers			1
mr @entity4 stepped down from the payday loan giant two weeks ago as the @entity16 watchdog , the @entity13 ( @entity13 ) , prepared to issue a damning judgment on @entity5 ’s treatment of customers			1
the @entity20 businessman founded @entity5 in 2007 and was chief executive at the time the company invented two law firms and sent threatening letters to 45,000 customers who were behind on repayments			1
despite this , he has walked away from the company with a personal fortune estimated at more than £ 34million and without suffering any sanction			2
the @entity13 has ordered @entity5 to pay compensation of some £ 2.6million to the customers involved , which is pocket money to the wealthy company and works out at flat rate of just £ 50 each			1
but that has left consumer groups and mps demanding to know why mr @entity4 and @entity5 have not been investigated under a series of possible criminal offences			1
earlier this week , sources at the @entity13 indicated that the @entity16 were asked to investigate @entity5 ’s activities by its predecessor , the @entity44 ( @entity44 ) , last year and they decided not to take any action			1
however , this has been denied by the police , while @entity5 says the company and its executives were never contacted by officers			2
there are a number of potential offences which @entity5 may have committed including a breach of @entity55 of 1974 , which makes it an offence for someone to falsely claim to be a solicitor			2
there is also the @entity61 , which make it a crime to harass debtors , as well as the @entity64 and the @entity65			0
@entity66 of the @entity67 said : ‘ clearly there are a very large number of victims			0
each one has been mugged by @entity5			2
‘ it seems to me that no - one – not the @entity44 , the @entity74 , not the @entity13 or the police have focussed on the effect upon the victims and the sheer scale of what has gone on			0
‘ investigations should be carried out			0
apart from who knew what was going on - who came up with the idea ? who approved it ? who put it into action ? ‘ of course , mr @entity4 as the chief executive and the man running the company at the time should be investigated			1
if action is not taken then it will undermine confidence in the regulatory process once again			0
’ @entity5 has been slammed for pressurising indebted to customers by sending letters from fake law firms conservative mp for the @entity102 , @entity103 , said there appear to be grounds for urgent police action			1
he said : ‘ i support this industry , but @entity5 is n’t doing itself any favours with this type of sharp practice and it ’s a matter of urgency for police attention			0
@entity5 is its own worst enemy on this and this could be the tip of the iceberg			0
’ @entity117 mp @entity116 has called for the @entity118 to investigate the payday loan industry and the apparent inability of @entity16 watchdogs to fine @entity5 for historic offences			1
‘ the idea that a company can send thousands are letters to customers from imaginary law firms and the regulator not able to fine them is something i and the majority of people in the @entity133 will find appalling , ’ he said			1
@entity117 mp , @entity134 , told mps in the @entity136 yesterday there was a good case for investigating the directors and removing their right to hold a credit licence			0
@entity117 has been keen to play up the fact that a major donor to the conservative party also holds a huge stake in @entity5 , which is said to be worth more than £ 380million			0
@entity146 , who has donated more than £ 500,000 to the conservatives since 2006 , is also the chairman of @entity148 , which has made a fortune from investing in @entity5			0
@entity117 mp , @entity150 , suggested the only way to make @entity5 suffer would be to apply the same interest rates it uses for customers to the £ 2.6million the company has been told to repay			1
using this calculation , he suggested the company would have to hand back £ 203 trillion			0
speaking during the weekly commons business statement , mr @entity150 said : ‘ can we have emergency legislation on compensation and compound interest to make @entity5 pay out not £ 2.6 million compensation for unfair practice but at their own outrageous interest rates of 5,853per cent , make them pay £ 203 trillion ? ‘ perhaps then they would understand the misery they cause ? ’ mr @entity4 , 44 , has made no comment on the @entity173 since details were released earlier this week			1
@entity5 claimed the businessman , who was educated at @entity176 , had departed in what it called an ‘ orderly exit from the company ’ that would allow him to work on new business ventures			2
the fiercely private individual spilt from his wife @entity183 , the mother of the couple ’s three young children , last year after 15 years of marriage in what was described as an amicable break			0
@entity5 has apologised for the letters and insists that all the managers who were in place at the time they were sent between 2008 and 2010 have since left the business			2
asked whether mr @entity4 had suffered any sanction for his part in the fiasco , the company said : ‘ the historic debt collection letters are @entity5 ’s responsibility , and so we wo n’t be commenting on particular individuals			1
‘ we provided information on the letters to the @entity44 in 2011 , and since then have been working with them and our current regulator the @entity13 on a resolution for customers			0
no - one from the company has been interviewed by the police on this matter			0
