renowned children 's author @entity0 may have famously written that it took 501 seagulls to help @entity4 fly the @entity5 - but a scientific study has concluded that the actual figure would need to be significantly higher			1
calculations by a group of @entity11 physics students show a total of 2,425,907 birds would be needed to lift the peach - the size of a small house in @entity0 's story - into the air			1
the undergraduates were inspired to use the childhood tale , which has delighted youngsters across the world since it was first published in the 1960s , as the basis for a scientific paper			2
@entity26 saw a young boy traveling in a large peach held by 501 seagulls			1
however , researchers now say it would have taken 2.5m to lift the huge fruit			1
the group first calculated the weight of the peach , using measurements described in the book			2
by multiplying its density by its volume , and using @entity42 's famous second law of motion , they arrived at a figure of @entity45 - the amount of force it would take to move the peach			2
next , they worked out how much weight each seagull could lift they calculated this at just over two newtons - allowing them to work out how many it would take to lift the peach			2
in the book , a young boy named @entity4 embarks on a journey across the @entity61 on a magical peach , enlisting seagulls to carry it			1
one of the students , @entity67 , said : ' our degree encourages us to learn and apply real principles of physics to new and imaginative topics , and as all of us knew the story and i particularly loved it , we thought it would be a great idea to use it for our paper			1
' earlier in our degree , we studied the physics of aircraft and specifically what it takes to get them into the air			2
' we thought it would be fantastic to apply that knowledge to the giant peach			0
' @entity4 and his @entity5 in flight during the film version of @entity0 's classic book the group first calculated the potential weight of the peach , using measurements based on the size of a small house , as described in the book			0
by multiplying its density by its volume , and using @entity42 's famous second law of motion , they arrived at a figure of @entity45 - the amount of force it would take to move the peach			0
next , they worked out how much weight each seagull could lift based on its wingspan , the density of air around it and the speed it would travel			0
written in 1961 by @entity0 , @entity26 tells the story of a young @entity117 orphan boy , @entity116			1
he enters a gigantic , magical peach leading to a series of strange adventures with six insects he meets			0
originally titled @entity4 and the @entity123 , @entity0 changed it to @entity26 because a peach is ' prettier , bigger and squishier ' than a cherry			1
according to the book , the stone at the centre of the peach becomes a @entity132 apartment where @entity4 lives			0
it was adapted into a film of the same name in 1996			0
they calculated this at just over two newtons - allowing them to work out how many it would take to lift the peach			0
@entity142 added : ' it showed us that 501 seagulls would be nowhere near enough to lift the peach , and that it would take much more - nearly 2.5 million seagulls to do this			1
' we 've all had a brilliant time working on this project			0
' it 's been lots of fun , and it 's been great using @entity0 's story as inspiration			0
' it 's also helped show us how to write a proper scientific paper			0
' a still from the @entity160 version of @entity0 's classic book , showing @entity4 at sea on his giant seagull powered peach course leader dr @entity165 , a lecturer at the university 's department of physics and astronomy , said : ' a lot of the papers we published are on subjects that are amusing , topical , or a bit off - the - wall			0
our students are nothing if not creative			1
' but , to be a research physicist you need to show some imagination , and this is something that the module allows our students to practice			2
' university of @entity11 physics students found a total of 2,425,907 birds would be needed to lift a peach the size of a small house			1

in @entity26 , the huge fruit was carried by 501 seagulls
@entity11 students found 2,425,907 birds would be needed
