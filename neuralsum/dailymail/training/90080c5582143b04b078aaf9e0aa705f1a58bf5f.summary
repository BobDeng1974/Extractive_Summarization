@entity3 's opening @entity1 opponents @entity4 saw their @entity6 send - off party fall flat as they were held to an embarrassing draw by @entity9 lightweights @entity10 at the @entity11 in @entity12 on wednesday night			1
four years after the then world champions finished bottom of a group that included @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 , @entity4 take off for @entity19 late on thursday on the back of a real upset			1
@entity3 will take note that @entity23 had made six changes – including taking off key men @entity26 and @entity27 – by the time uncharacteristically poor marking allowed @entity28 to head in from a late corner			1
embarrassing : @entity4 saw their @entity6 send - off party fall flat against lightweights @entity10 delight : @entity10 's coach @entity34 ( left ) leads the celebrations after his side held @entity4 @entity23 will also claim that his players are exhausted from a brutal training camp in @entity39 this week designed to duplicate the stifling heat of @entity41 , where @entity4 and @entity3 will meet on june 14			1
but it was still a jolt for the @entity44 who had been in party mood from the moment @entity27 set up an early goal for @entity49			1
‘ i ’m not disappointed because i knew my team had worked a lot on their physical conditioning , ’ said @entity23			2
‘ we have based our operation to be ready for @entity55 not now			2
we knew we might pay the price at some point			2
‘ my team will be ready in @entity55			0
we still have to work on a few details like freekicks and corners			0
you could see tonight that we were not ready on those sort of things			0
‘ i was not very happy with my team playing too many long balls as well			0
we need to work on that			0
in @entity55 we wo n’t have all the space like we did tonight against @entity10			0
shocker : @entity27 ca n't hide his disappointment as @entity4 are held by minnows @entity10 battle : the former @entity72 striker is tackled by @entity10 defender @entity73 downcast : @entity27 trudges off after being substituted by @entity4 coach @entity23 ‘ we should have scored a second goal to kill it off but we did n’t and we have to learn from that			1
’ asked if he could take any heart from @entity3 ’s draw against @entity80 in @entity81 , @entity23 replied : ‘ the results before the @entity6 do n’t matter because those are friendly games and we saw that tonight			0
you do n’t have to give too much significance to these results			0
’ the surprise draw also added to a difficult week for @entity23 who has been forced to defend his decision to pick striker @entity89 , scorer of just three @entity91 goals for @entity93 last season , in his 23 - man squad instead of @entity95 and @entity96			0
the broken leg suffered by @entity98 in @entity4 ’s previous friendly against the @entity100 also meant @entity23 had to experiment by partnering @entity26 and @entity101 together in central midfield for the first time , even though some argue that they are too similar in style			1
according to plan : @entity4 took the lead through @entity108 , but things then went pear - shaped change : @entity4 had to experiment by partnering @entity26 and @entity101 together in central midfield concern : @entity44 striker @entity112 at the end of the friendly match @entity115 @entity4 : @entity4 fans packed into @entity12 to see their team 's last match on home soil before @entity55 @entity120 played the anchor role in a 4 - 1 - 4 - 1 formation but that is n’t necessarily how @entity4 will start against @entity3			1
the media here speculated that @entity23 could use up to five different formations in @entity55 – including a 4 - 1 - 2 - 1 - 2 or a three - man defence – and he was able to tinker with his line - up in the second half			2
they should have been further ahead before @entity10 ’s late equaliser with @entity27 in particular guilty of several misses , including hitting the bar from 15 yards			1
@entity23 defended the former @entity72 striker saying : ‘ @entity27 played very well			1
even though he did n’t score he created some opportunities			0
’ you suspect the @entity4 boss will not be so forgiving in nine days ’ time however .			2
