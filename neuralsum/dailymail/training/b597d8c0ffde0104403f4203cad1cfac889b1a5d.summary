the @entity0 has voted to go forward with the proposal of new rules that could let internet service providers charge content companies for faster and more reliable delivery of their traffic to users			1
the controversial ' fast lane ' rules has received heavy criticism from many companies that do business online , along with open @entity14 advocates			2
outside the hearing protesters banged drums and held up signs calling for net neutrality , while at least one was ushered out of the hearing after standing up and yelling at the commissioners			1
under the plans for priority usage , @entity29 would pay extra to use fast lanes to get the maximum amount of bandwith to its customers , and maintain and improve streaming quality and reliability			1
this is being heavily criticised by net neutrality campaigners			1
at the heart of net neutrality is an open internet in which all data being sent from websites to customers is treated the same , regardless of size or destination			1
all this traffic is given the same priority along the same lanes and no site is given preferential treatment			2
although it seems like a fair model , in which sites that use the most bandwith pay the most money , campaigners claim it will drastically impact on industry competition			2
for example , @entity29 has the money to pay for better service , using the fast lanes , while smaller companies do n't			1
this means smaller companies may have the same range of content , but because they ca n't stream at the same quality , they are effectively priced out of the market			2
to address these claims , the new rules include a ' competition test '			2
isps would need to decide if a website meets the critieria to be given priority access and that this bar must be set high enough to protect competition			0
the preliminary vote , in which three of agency 's commissioners supported the measure and two dissented , moves the so - called ' net neutrality ' rules into a formal public comment period			1
after the 120 - day period ends , the @entity0 will revise the proposal and vote on a final set of rules			1
@entity0 chairman @entity23 has said he wants the rules in place by the end of this year			1
' today we take another step in what has been a decade - long effort to protect a free and open @entity14 , ' @entity23 , a @entity94 , said before the vote			2
under the plans for priority usage , @entity29 would pay extra to use fast lanes to get the maximum amount of bandwith to its customers , and maintain and improve streaming quality and reliability			1
but the idea of allowing priority access , even if it 's regulated by the government , has received heavy criticism from many companies that do business online , along with open @entity14 advocates			0
outside the hearing protesters banged drums and held up signs calling for net neutrality			1
at least one was ushered out of the hearing after standing up and yelling at the commissioners			0
commissioner @entity122 , who voted no , called the proposed rules a " regulatory boondoggle , " arguing that supporters of the rules have n't shown they will help consumers			0
and commissioner @entity128 , who also voted no , said the issue would be better decided by @entity130 than by five unelected officials			0
but since the issue has fallen on the commission , he argued that a group of economists from across the country should do peer - reviewed studies and host a series of public hearings to hammer out their differences before a decision is made			0
' in short , getting the future of the internet right is more important than getting this done right now , ' @entity128 said			0
@entity145 of @entity146 ( @entity147 ) , along with other demonstrators , protest outside the @entity0 ( @entity0 )			2
at least one was ushered out of the hearing after standing up and yelling at the commissioners			0
a previous set of rules from 2010 was struck down by an appeals court in january after @entity155 challenged them			0
the @entity0 says the rules currently proposed follow the blueprint set forth by that court decision			1
in addition , the commission will consider the possibility of defining internet service providers as " common carriers , " like telephone companies , which are subject to greater regulation than @entity14 providers , under @entity168 of the @entity169			0
the @entity0 and @entity23 have so far avoided subjecting cable and telecoms companies to @entity173 treatment , although @entity23 has said the option remains on the table			1
@entity29 has found success with original content including @entity178 and @entity179 is the @entity180 , as well as the streaming of other tv shows and films			0
to stream these shows , it uses a large amount of bandwith - much more than standard text and videos on webpages , for example			0
under the plans for priority lanes , @entity29 would pay extra to use these lanes to get the maximum amount of bandwith to its customers , and maintain or improve the streaming quality and reliability			1
earlier this month @entity29 raised its prices in @entity199 , the @entity200 and the @entity201 by € 1 , £ 1 and $ 1 respectively			0
customers of @entity29 , which has produced shows including @entity178 ( pictured ) , could be charged more to stream programmes if the website chooses to pay more for a better service this price rise applies to new customers only , while existing customers will remain on the old price for two years			0
@entity0 chairman @entity23 has broadened the scope of his proposed open internet rules and suggested tougher standards for internet providers who wish to create paid priority fast lanes on their networks			1
according to an @entity0 official , @entity23 made revisions after the commission received 35,000 public comments - many of them expressing outrage			1
@entity23 , a @entity94 , also tweaked his proposal after the commission 's two other @entity226 expressed concern			2
' the new draft clearly reflects public input the commission has received , ' the @entity0 official said in a statement			2
' the draft is explicit that the goal is to find the best approach to ensure the @entity14 remains open and prevent any practices that threaten it			0
' @entity29 , which has also released @entity179 is the @entity180 , could be made to pay more to use priority fast lanes on @entity240 networks among the additions is a provision that would ' presume ' it to be illegal for an internet provider to prioritise the traffic of an affiliated service - for example , it would be considered illegal if @entity247 tried to give faster treatment to video streams of its subsidiary network , @entity250			1
however , an internet service provider would be allowed to challenge that ' presumption , ' the official said			0
in the revised proposal , @entity23 also seeks comment on the possibility of treating broadband providers as so - called ' common carriers ' like telephone companies , which are subject to greater regulation than internet providers , under @entity168 of the @entity169			2
the @entity0 and @entity23 have so far avoided subjecting cable and telecoms companies to @entity173 treatment , although @entity23 has said the option remains on the table			1
in the new proposal , he entertains more discussion on it than his initial proposal did			0
@entity0 chairman @entity23 has broadened the scope of his proposed open internet rules and suggested tougher standards for internet providers who wish to create paid priority fast lanes on their networks the proposal also asks whether all paid - priority fast lanes should be banned outright			1
the previous version only asks if some paid - priority services should be banned			0
@entity23 has faced a torrent of criticism after the earlier proposal made it appear as if he was overhauling the principle of net neutrality , which says internet service providers should not be allowed to discriminate against web traffic depending on its source			1
such discrimination could result if a phone company like @entity294 slowed down traffic from phone services like @entity297 , or if @entity247 slowed @entity29 video speeds to favour its own online video service , @entity300			0
an earlier set of rules from 2010 was struck down by an appeals court in january after @entity155 challenged them .			0

decision could mean content providers pay more to use priority fast lanes
@entity0 chairman @entity23 has said he wants the rules in place by the end of this year
