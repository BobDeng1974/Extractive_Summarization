the cliff has a drop of some 65 feet to a concrete car park , but luckily @entity7 was unhurt because he landed in a bush about 15 feet down			1
safe and sound : @entity6 hugs her 19 - month - old son @entity7 ( left ) after he survived falling off a cliff at @entity22 in @entity12 by landing in a bush ( right ) ms @entity6 jumped down to him , breaking her fall slightly by grabbing grass and digging her nails into the cliff face			1
ms @entity6 , 39 , who runs a guest house with her husband @entity28 , 44 , said the incident happened on @entity22 in @entity12 last saturday			1
she said they had been following butterflies with her little lad at what she thought was a safe distance			0
but the thick grass and vegetation at the spot made it seem to her that they were two feet from the edge , when in fact they were much closer			1
ms @entity6 , a mother of two , said she had a firm hand on the hood of @entity7 ’s jacket but as the child took one more step towards the edge - a distance she thought was too close - he disappeared over the side			1
' it was just the worst moment of my life , he somersaulted twice and landed on a shrub about 15 feet down , ' she said			1
' as he dropped i jumped , you just do n’t think about it at the time			0
it was a maternal instinct			0
' they say your whole life flashes before your eyes but it was his death that flashed before mine , i was afraid of what i would see when i found him			2
' i know what was at the bottom of that cliff			2
it was a terrifying moment			2
' she said she stopped beside her son , who had started crying as soon as he landed in the bush			1
' i grabbed him and laid for ages on that bush , she said			2
' i was shaking that much it felt like hours but it was probably minutes			0
it is your worst fear			2
terrified : ms @entity6 said it was the worst moment of her life when @entity7 fell while chasing butterflies ' i was saying " do n’t move baby , stay still baby "			1
' despite wearing four - inch high - heeled boots , ms @entity6 was able to bring @entity7 back to the top after a few minutes			1
' once we got to the top we lay down for a long time , ' she said			0
' after 10 minutes he was fine but i was in shock and started being sick and shaking			0
' it was around five minutes from when @entity7 fell until i got him back to safety but it seemed like hours			2
' there are only one or two of those shrubs on the side of the cliff			2
it is so lucky that he landed on one			0
' as soon as @entity7 fell i started screaming and was still screaming when i jumped over the side but i had n’t realised it			0
' a man had been watching on another cliff and ran to get round to us			0
he told me that he had heard a bloodcurdling scream			0
' i was bit incoherent but but he calmed me down			0
' ms @entity6 said the man who helped her was called @entity114 and lived in @entity115 but she had no more details			1
she warned other people to take care at the cliff edge but said the grass should remain overgrown for the wildlife			1
she said : ' i never once let go of him and thought nothing would happen but the edge is much closer than you think			0
' it took me ages to get home			0
i kept being sick and bursting into tears on the way			0
' i wo n’t be going near a cliff edge again with children , no way			1
' i consider myself to be a safety - conscious mum , but look what happened			0
' dramatic : the white spot marks the point from which @entity7 fell			0
the shrub broke his fall - and prevented him landing in a concrete car park some 50 feet further down			1

@entity142 had a *miraculous* escape after slipping from the cliff edge at @entity22 in @entity12 , @entity13

mother @entity6 , 39 , saved him by jumping into the bush and *climbing* back up the cliff
' it was just the worst moment of my life , ' she said
