@entity0 has been dropped as the face of the @entity3 's coverage of the @entity4			1
the announcement comes six months after criticism of his hosting while also being being a face of @entity9 , one of the show 's sponsors for 30 years , he has helped educate green - fingered enthusiasts on everything from their orchids to their azaleas			1
but the @entity3 yesterday announced that @entity0 will no longer present their coverage of the @entity4 – just six months after the star became embroiled in a sponsorship row			1
the 64 - year - old is being replaced by @entity23 ’ world host @entity24 and newsreader @entity26 - who unlike the majority of @entity4 presenters is not a gardening expert - as part of a revamp of the corporation ’s coverage			1
@entity0 has presented the long - running event , which has become a horticultural highlight with viewers , since 1983			0
however , the @entity3 came under fire in may this year after it emerged he had been allowed to front the coverage on @entity40 and @entity41 while also being the face of @entity9 , a sponsor at the event			1
the supermarket ’s exhibit of @entity46 produce — featuring fruit , vegetables , flowers and plants on sale in its stores — won a gold medal at the event this year			0
@entity0 has a lucrative deal to promote the supermarket chain ’s gardening range			1
last year the @entity3 banned three presenters — @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60 — who had all designed @entity4 gardens , from covering the event because of ‘ conflict of interest ’ concerns			0
@entity58 was dropped from the main evening programme after he designed a show garden for @entity68 chain @entity67 , while @entity59 and @entity60 were not allowed on screen until the winners of their category had been announced			2
@entity73 was dropped by the @entity3 from its 2006 @entity4 coverage after appearing in a commercial for compost company @entity76			2
and in 1976 , @entity77 was axed by the @entity3 from his job presenting @entity79 for appearing in an @entity81 weedkiller advert			2
after @entity0 was allowed to continue in his role , critics claimed that the corporation had one rule for its best - known presenters and another for lesser lights			0
@entity79 host @entity24 , left , and newsreader @entity26 , right , will front the corporation 's coverage of the popular flower show in 2014 the @entity4 had been @entity93 ’s last major commitment for the @entity3 , and his departure effectively ends a lengthy association			1
a @entity3 spokeswoman said : ‘ the way the @entity4 coverage will be presented across the @entity3 has changed for 2014 , and @entity0 decided to step away from next year ’s show			1
’ @entity0 said : ‘ i really enjoyed my 30 years of presenting @entity4 coverage for the @entity3 and wish the new team every success			1
’ the presenter , who began his broadcasting career as a horticulture expert on @entity106 , left his role as anchor of @entity41 ’s @entity23 ’ @entity108 in 2002 , which had been filmed in his own garden			0
between 1997 and 2002 he hosed @entity3 programme @entity111 , which at its peak pulled in 12 million viewers			0
but he has increasingly turned his attentions away from the @entity3 and now has an afternoon @entity117 chat show and hosts a series on @entity119			0
miss @entity26 said : ‘ i am delighted and honoured to be a part of the @entity4 2014 team			2
i grew up in a family of very keen gardeners so know something about the joys and sheer hard work that go in to creating such beautiful places			0
’ @entity0 has proved hugely popular with viewers and in in 2007 he was named as one of the 100 greatest sex symbols in a tv poll			0
his @entity133 waxwork was once revealed to be ‘ one of the most fondled ’ , and apparently gets kissed so often that lipstick has to be washed from the face of the waxwork twice a week .			0

six months *ago* the presenter was criticised for presenting the corporation 's coverage while also being a face of the supermarket chain , a show sponsor
