first - time parents @entity0 and @entity2 were heartbroken when they were told one of their twins - born two minutes apart at just 26 weeks - had stopped breathing and had just moments to live			1
thinking it was the only time they would have with the tiny boy they had already decided to name @entity11 , @entity0 asked to be able to hold the lifeless child , and told @entity2 to climb into the hospital bed for a tender embrace			1
what happened next was nothing short of a miracle			0
hospital staff rushed back to his aid and together brought the baby back to life			0
five years on , @entity36 is a healthy , happy kid whose biggest problem regarding his troubled entry in the world is having a little brother who tells anyone who 'll listen that he used to be dead but now he 's alive			0
after years of trying to fall pregnant , the @entity43 couple were delighted to find out they were having twins - the ' pigeon pair ' of a boy and girl			1
but just six months into the pregnancy they found themselves in the delivery room and facing premature births			1
@entity11 was born first on march 25 , 2010 and his sister @entity23 followed two minutes later			1
' they were both born in their sac but @entity11 did n't make a noise when they tore it open			1
@entity23 let out a big wail , ' ms @entity60 told @entity62			1
' we looked over and everyone was crowding around @entity11 - there was about 20 people in the room			1
the vibe was n't very good			2
when they were told the devastating news , @entity0 ordered her husband to take off his shirt and get into the bed to provide extra warmth - and miraculously he gasped for air and opened his eyes doctors worked on @entity11 for 20 minutes before they stopped and informed his heartbroken parents the doctor sat on the end of ms @entity60 's hospital bed and asked the couple if they had a name picked out after birth , skin - to - skin contact is recognised as a simple step mothers can take to welcome their baby into the world			1
for @entity0 and @entity2 the point is all the more pertinent			1
the birth process is a stressful and exhausting time for the baby			2
@entity94 advises mothers to hold their child in skin - to - skin contact to help their baby ' adapt to their new environment '			0
it means their ' heartbeat and breathing will be better controlled ' and there is a wealth of evidence that suggests babies held in skin - to - skin contact are less stressed by the birth process			2
@entity94 's advice states : ' we know that babies who have spent an hour in skin contact are significantly less stressed after the birth experience - this means their breathing and heart rate are more stable , they cry less , and when they start to feed , they digest their food better			2
' a mother 's chest area is significantly warmer than other parts of her body - ready to welcome her new baby and prevent them from cooling down - which is a significant risk			0
' your baby has been lovely and warm in your uterus - at around 37 degrees , whereas the labour room will be significantly cooler , and he is wet – it ’s like getting out of the swimming baths , you need to get dry and warm quickly			2
' meanwhile @entity127 , chief executive of the premature baby charity , @entity129 , echoed the importance of skin - to - skin contact			2
she said it is ' an essential part of family - centred care and should be part of the care that all babies receive '			0
ms @entity127 added : ' evidence shows that it can help to regulate the baby ’s heartbeat , lower their stress levels and can play an important role in improving the positive outcomes for premature babies			2
’ ' he stopped breathing and his heartbeat was nearly gone			0
after 20 minutes they stopped working on him			0
' the doctor sat on the end of ms @entity60 's hospital bed and asked the couple if they had a name picked out			0
he then informed them that there was nothing more they could do to save @entity11			1
' i saw him gasp but the doctor said it was no use			0
i took @entity11 off the doctor , asked everyone to leave			1
he was cold and i just wanted him to be warm , ' she said			0
' we had tried for years to have kids and i felt so guilty			0
i just wanted to cuddle him			0
i unwrapped him and ordered my husband to take his shirt off and climb into the bed			0
' i know it sounds stupid , but if he was still gasping there was still a sign of life so i was n't going to give up easily			1
' i know it sounds stupid , but if he was still gasping there was still a sign of life so i was n't going to give up easily , ' mrs @entity60 said ' we were trying to entice him to stay			1
we explained his name and that he had a twin that he had to look out for and how hard we tried to have him , ' mrs @entity60 said ' he suddenly gasped ... then he opened his eyes			1
he was breathing and grabbing @entity190 's finger , ' mrs @entity60 said ' we were trying to entice him to stay			0
we explained his name and that he had a twin that he had to look out for and how hard we tried to have him			0
' he suddenly gasped ... then he opened his eyes			1
he was breathing and grabbing @entity190 's finger			0
' if we had let the doctor walk out of the room with him , @entity11 would have been dead			2
' @entity11 and @entity23 are now about to turn five years old and their parents have only recently told them of the miraculous story			1
' @entity23 burst into tears , she was really upset and she kept hugging @entity11 , ' ms @entity60 said			1
' they love to talk about when they were babies			0
' they have a little brother @entity203 who loves telling anyone who listens			0
he 'll say : " when i was born i was fat and the twins were skinny			2
@entity11 was also dead but now he is alive "			2
' @entity23 and @entity11 also have a little brother @entity203 , 4 , and regularly talk about their miracle birth story remarkably , @entity11 has not encountered one medical problem in the five years since his birth when the twins were first told of their miracle birth , @entity23 burst into tears and would n't stop hugging @entity11 the @entity2 family have set up an online community called @entity216 to regularly raise funds for the @entity218 - an organisation that supports premature and sick newborns remarkably , @entity11 has not encountered one medical problem in the five years since his birth			1
' he is absolutely fine ... the biggest concern they had was cerebral palsy because of the lack of oxygen but there 's been nothing , ' ms @entity60 said			0
' it 's absolutely astounding			0
this whole experience makes you cherish them more			0
' the @entity2 family have set up an online community called @entity216 to regularly raise funds for the @entity218 - an organisation that supports premature and sick newborns			1
