many rail fares have more than trebled in the two decades since privatisation – with some open return tickets now costing more than the price of taking a family to the @entity6 or a solo flight to @entity8 , research reveals			1
@entity10 ’s leading rail fare analyst has calculated that fares on some of the most popular routes have increased by between 141 per cent and 246 per cent over the past 20 years , while inflation has gone up by 77 per cent over the same period			2
the study of ‘ anytime ’ open return fares – the most expensive and most flexible ‘ walk - up tickets ’ – shows how an open return to @entity18 with @entity19 has rocketed from £ 96 in 1995 to £ 329 today , an increase of 243 per cent			1
how do they compare ? driving or flying can now be cheaper than catching the train - even for solo journeys that is more than eight times the cost of an open return @entity28 coach journey at £ 39.50 and enough to pay for a family of four flying on @entity30 to @entity31 ( £ 184 ) or @entity32 ( £ 240 )			1
it would also pay for a flight to @entity35 on @entity36 ( £ 240 ) , or a single traveller flying to @entity8 for £ 334 with @entity38			1
the fare findings follow a damning report this week by rail watchdogs showing that rail travellers have registered the lowest level of satisfaction with the railways in five years			2
they were annoyed by overcrowded , expensive and late - running services			2
in january fares rose across all types of tickets by an average of 2.2 per cent			2
but season tickets went up by 2.5 per cent – not only well above the @entity54 ( @entity54 ) inflation figure but also in excess of most annual pay rises			2
customer dissatisfaction has been compounded by anger over ‘ fat cat bonuses ’ awarded to rail chiefs , which have been branded ‘ rewards for failure ’			1
expensive : the comparison was carried out 20 years after the privatisation of the railways in @entity10 return tickets pre-booked £ 41 @entity67 £ 53 athens £ 62 @entity35 £ 94 @entity69 £ 95 @entity70 £ 150 @entity71 £ 282 @entity72 £ 334 @entity8 source : @entity74 @entity75 , an independent fares expert , was commissioned to carry out research on rising ticket prices by the @entity78 ( @entity78 ) union			1
his research shows that an open return rail ticket between @entity82 and @entity83 has soared by 246 per cent – from £ 57 to £ 197			1
the anytime fare from the capital to @entity86 has jumped by 232 per cent from £ 93 to £ 309 , while to @entity87 it has increased by 211 per cent from £ 70 to £ 218			2
this makes cars a cost - effective alternative to rail travel – especially for families			0
@entity94 president @entity93 said : ‘ for the cost of my annual rail season ticket – a painful £ 4,028 – i could buy a second - hand car for £ 1000 , tax and insure it and still have enough to pay for 20,000 miles of petrol , which is two years ’ motoring for the average driver			1
’ a spokesman for @entity19 defended the £ 329 return anytime fare from @entity82 to @entity18 , noting that a fraction of travellers paid it and most chose from a range of cheaper flexible options			1
they added : ‘ over the last year the number of passengers travelling on the standard anytime fare of £ 164.50 one way and £ 329 return represented only 3.7 per cent of the journeys made between @entity82 and @entity18			1
an open return to @entity117 even with nationalised @entity118 costs £ 313 - up from £ 130 two decades ago many of our advanced fares from @entity18 remained the same or came down in january – overall our fares increased by 1.4 per cent which is significantly below the industry average			1
’ a spokesman for the @entity126 , which represents @entity127 and train operators , said : ‘ the @entity78 ’s figures are misleading in the extreme as they deliberately focus only on the most expensive fares			0
on average , the cost of rail travel has increased by 6 per cent in real terms over the last 15 years			0
‘ this helps explain why passenger numbers have almost doubled over the period , contributing to a fivefold increase in money going back to reinvest in a better railway			0
’ but @entity143 ’s transport spokesman @entity142 said : ‘ rail passengers are being let down and ripped off			0
things have got worse on our railways			0
’ and @entity78 general secretary @entity147 said : ‘ passengers have paid a terrible price for this political folly			0
the private rail industry has taken all the gain while passengers have suffered all the pain			0
passengers have paid a small fortune on fares while rail bosses are paid a fortune			0
‘ we want to end this persecution of passengers which started after privatisation			0
’ he added : ‘ it is hardly surprising that satisfaction is falling when commuters are paying record fares for a worsening service			0
it is an absolute disgrace			0

open return from @entity82 to @entity18 has soared from £ 96 to £ 329
that could pay for flight to @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity35 or even @entity8
