@entity1 's wife told her two young sons their father had to go to work the night in january when a team of police officers led her husband away in handcuffs			1
it had been nearly six years since he left prison , and his family believed he had paid his debt to society			1
but @entity13 should have stayed behind bars for the rest of his life			0
a court clerk 's error led to his release in 2008 — 90 years too soon			1
@entity1 's case comes as other clerical errors have let criminals evade prison time			1
in @entity47 , a judge this week freed a convicted robber who did n't report to prison — despite trying to do so — for 13 years because of a clerical mistake			1
a @entity51 murder suspect who was accidentally freed last year due to a clerk 's error was captured on thursday			1
and in @entity26 , an inmate mistakenly released four years early due to such a mistake killed the state 's corrections chief at his front door last year			1
that prompted gov. @entity60 to order an audit of thousands of inmates ' records to ensure they are serving the correct sentences			1
@entity1 was n't part of the audit because it focused on other kinds of felonies , corrections department spokeswoman @entity66 said			0
after being released from prison in 2008 , @entity72 reconnected with his old girlfriend , @entity34 , and helped raised her son , @entity23 , 7 , before having a son together , @entity24 , 4 @entity1 and another man were convicted in 2000 after robbing two @entity25 video stores when @entity1 was 20			1
in one robbery , they ordered employees into a back room at gunpoint , and a worker was ordered to the floor as they demanded money from a safe			1
a judge sentenced @entity1 to serve back - to - back sentences on eight convictions , for a total of 98 years			1
but a court clerk mistakenly wrote in his file that the sentences were to run at the same time			1
corrections officials depend on that file to determine how much time an inmate should serve			2
@entity1 was released on parole in 2008 after serving just eight years			1
he set about building his life — while , prosecutors say , being fully aware of the clerical error and never notifying authorities			0
@entity1 , now 35 , started selling coupon books door - to - door , and more recently became skilled at cutting and installing windows			2

@entity119 in prison for his birthday party			2
' that was his life , raising his kids and being a husband , ' @entity34 said			0
' he definitely was not the same person that he was when he went in to prison			2
' @entity1 's co-defendant , @entity130 , also would have been mistakenly released early , but the error in his file was uncovered after he filed an appeal in his case			2
@entity130 is serving 98 years in prison			1
@entity1 filed his own appeal in 2000 but , in a rare move , asked that it be dismissed less than a year later			2
prosecutors say that showed he was aware of the clerical error before his release and feared any further court action would call attention to it			2
@entity145 , an @entity146 senior deputy district attorney , said he was alerted to the error in january by a former prosecutor who handled @entity1 's case and was checking on its status			0
@entity145 quickly filed a motion to send @entity1 back to prison			1
' he should go back because the law requires the sentence he received			0
this was a number of very serious criminal offenses , and anything less would be inappropriate , ' @entity145 said			0
' he should not be able to escape the minimum sentence due to a clerical error			0
' @entity1 became skilled at cutting and installing windows after leaving prison			0
he helped coach soccer and was an active church member @entity66 , with the state corrections department , said it was the court that made the mistake and prison officials would not have known @entity119 was released incorrectly			1
@entity171 public defender @entity170 did not return calls seeking comment			0
in april , a judge declined to release @entity13 at his public defender 's request , noting that @entity1 knew he should have served 98 years but remained silent about the mistake			1

if he knew there was a mistake , he would have told me , ' @entity34 said			0
she said her husband did not try to mask his identity			0
the prospect of @entity119 remaining imprisoned for nine more decades has devastated his family			0
they argue his clean life after prison shows he has been punished enough			0
