@entity14 on the left slotted right to @entity21 in the @entity121 , from where he slid a pass to @entity56 , who fired right - footed across @entity35 and into the left - hand side of the goal			1
replays showed @entity56 to have been marginally offside as the final ball was played but the officials saw nothing wrong and the visitors were two up in three minutes			2
referee @entity131 did @entity26 a slight favour five minutes later when @entity35 ran out to catch a ball forward to @entity21 , and caught it while appearing to be marginally outside his area			1
instead of a handball , @entity74 allowed play to continue			0
