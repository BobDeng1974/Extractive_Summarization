@entity1 footballers will be warned in the next fortnight that they could face retrospective action if they follow the example of @entity6 cricketer @entity5 and make a public show of political support on the football pitch			1
in light of the current conflicts engulfing the @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 , both the @entity16 and the @entity1 are acutely aware of the sensitivities but a new amendment to the @entity19 by @entity20 will see a global crackdown on such political statements this season			1
only this week , @entity25 cricketer @entity5 was banned from wearing ' @entity26 ' and ' free @entity28 ' wristbands by the @entity29 and even though athletes may argue the message is humanitarian , rather than political , football 's governing bodies will follow the lead of their cricket counterparts in clamping down on this			1
however , a new change to @entity20 laws will also stiffen the resolve of the governing bodies			2
previously , footballers were allowed to reveal a personal message or image on their undershirts but the law change , which comes into effect for the 2014/15 season , introduces a total ban against any messages being revealed by footballers			1
the amendment to the @entity20 rules sees a change to @entity73 , entitled @entity74 , and it now reads : ' players must not reveal undergarments that show political , religious , personal slogans , statement or images , or advertising other than the manufacturer logo			1
' ' a player / team of a player that reveals an undergarment that shows political , religious , personal slogans , statements or images , or advertising other than the manufacturing logo will be sanctioned by the competition organiser or by @entity20			1
' if , when celebrating a goal , a player was to lift their shirt to reveal any kind of message , the referee would be expected to include the incident in their subsequent post-match reports			2
retrospective action would then be taken by the @entity16 or @entity20 against the footballer			2
it would then be up to an @entity16 disciplinary commission to decide the punishment , whether it be an official warning , a fine or a suspension			0
not allowed : @entity111 's @entity110 showed a religious messages when he scored against @entity113 banned : players are not allowed to show messages like @entity118 's infamous ' @entity117 ? ' t - shirt a senior @entity16 source confirmed to @entity120 : ' we apply @entity20 's rules which cover player equipment and include the banning of political messages			1
' the new law would include potentially volatile messages about international politics but also tongue - in - cheek ones such as @entity118 's infamous ' why always me ? ' statement			2
the @entity16 are responsible for enforcing discipline in @entity25 football but @entity1 officials will also hold their annual pre-season meetings with leading managers in the coming weeks , where clubs will be briefed on these matters			1
the @entity140 ( @entity140 ) will also pay a pre-season visit to all squads to clarify the amendments to the @entity19 for this season			0
the stance will also apply to @entity147 competitions such as the @entity148 and @entity149			0
the strict changes to the legislation were agreed in march by the @entity152 and came into effect for the @entity154			0
however , following the the intensification of tensions , particularly between @entity38 and the @entity40 group @entity158 , there is growing concern that some individuals may follow in @entity5 's footsteps and attempt to show their support for certain factions			1
vocal : @entity166 's @entity165 has spoken out about the situation in the middle east on @entity169 on @entity169 , @entity166 midfielder @entity165 has been outspoken in his opposition against @entity38 's offensive in the @entity12			0
on friday , he posted 17 tweets in just over one hour , in which he questioned the existence of @entity175 and shared a picture that appeared to show @entity40 children severely injured			0
he then wrote : ' if @entity175 does exist			0
then he has to have allowed this to happen			0
which makes him well , a bit of a c * * * really ... # f * * * organisedreligion			0
' there is , however , an area of confusion developing as some would argue that expressing such volatile opinions on social media arguably constitutes a more powerful statement than unveiling a message on the field			2
on friday , the @entity16 would not comment on @entity165 's four - letter rant and it is understood that they recognise a divide between a player promoting political views on the pitch - wearing the colours of his team and representing the @entity1 - and writing on a personal online account			1
kick : supporters of reportedly @entity204 origin entered the pitch and headed for @entity207 players @entity208 was involved in @entity210 's match which had to be abandoned after @entity212 protesters invaded the pitch nonetheless , @entity165 has 2.65m followers and there is an acknowledgement that players must behave responsibly and there are precedents in place to impose sanctions on footballers for online behaviour that is deemed to be offensive			1
earlier this year , @entity225 defender @entity224 and @entity226 forward @entity227 were both punished when they tweeted their support for @entity230 after the @entity231 was banned for five matches when he celebrated a goal for @entity234 with the quenelle gesture , a signal interpreted by most to be an inverted @entity238 salute			1
any sanctions for improper conduct on social media would , however , be down to the @entity16 's interpretation alone , while on - pitch messages are now enshrined into @entity20 law			2
@entity166 , @entity165 's employers , refused to discuss the player 's actions when approached by @entity120 on friday afternoon			0
it was telling , however , that the player returned to @entity169 late on friday evening to say : ' should n't have used foul language in and around religion before but was angry at what i 'd seen			0
apologies if i offended anyone			0

@entity1 players will be *reminded* of the rules on political support on the pitch
