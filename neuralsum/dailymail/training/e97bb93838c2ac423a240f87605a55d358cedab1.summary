by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 16:00 est , 26 october 2012 updated : 01:58 est , 27 october 2012 a cold - call firm has been forced to pay compensation to a businessman after he took it to court for wasting his time			1
the stunning victory could open the floodgates to further claims from the millions of homeowners plagued by similar unwanted and infuriating calls			1
@entity13 vowed to hit back after he was targeted by firms promising compensation for mis - sold @entity16 ( @entity16 )			1
victory : @entity13 at his home @entity19 in @entity20 invoiced a ' cold caller ' for his time and they paid up the 53 - year - old turned the tables by invoicing one of the firms for £ 10 for every minute he wasted answering their telephone calls			1
he also recorded the calls , meaning that when the unscrupulous company denied ever having rung him , he was armed with incontrovertible proof to the contrary			1
he offered to send the firm the recordings but they ignored him , so he took his case to the small claims court			2
the claim stated : ‘ invoice is for the use of time , phone and electricity for receiving telemarketing communications ’			2
@entity13 's @entity43 against @entity44 in a victory for the little man , marketing company @entity47 , which sells referrals to claims management companies , agreed to pay the full £ 195 for 19 - and - a - half minutes of calls , plus a £ 25 court fee			1
yesterday , mr @entity13 said : ‘ i was feeling oppressed that i was getting called by these companies			1
once i sent the company the invoice , i felt as though the boot was on the other foot			2
i was n’t the victim any more			0
’ he is urging others targeted by cold - callers to follow his example			2
the nuisance calls – often using a pre-recorded voice message to set out an initial sales pitch – try to convince you that they can secure thousands of pounds in refunds of @entity16 , insurance supposed to cover debts if you fall ill or can not work			1
the county court has a ‘ small claims track ’ to handle claims for less than £ 5,000 , or £ 1,000 for personal injury or housing disrepair			2
the process is designed to be cheap and quick and should not require a solicitor			0
1 ) when it ’s worth making a @entity78 you make a small claim you need to show you have given the other party a clear opportunity to pay up			2
write a letter saying how much they owe and what for , and a warning that you will make a court claim if you do not receive the money beyond a reasonable deadline			2
it is worth seeking advice from a @entity91 or law centre before starting your action			0
2 ) how to get the ball rollingif the debtor does not respond in time , you can submit your small claims forms			0
these are available online – search for form ‘ @entity101 ’ at hmctsformfinder.justice.gov.uk – and cost £ 25 for claims up to £ 300 , rising to £ 100 for claims up to £ 5,000			1
if you are successful in your claim , the other party will be liable for this fee			0
3 ) what next ? the defendant has two weeks to respond to the court			0
hopefully they will not contest the case and pay up			0
but if they do , the court will allocate a hearing date , which often takes months			0
4 ) in courtthe two parties present their cases to a judge			0
your main aim is to prove the debt exists			0
you can take a ‘ lay representative ’ to speak on your behalf – it could be a relative or a friend			0
but if you decide to hire a solicitor you will probably have to foot the bill yourself – even if you win			0
they try to get hold of your personal details then pass them on to greedy claims - management companies desperate to grab a share of a £ 9billion compensation pot made available after @entity131 ’s banks were found to have routinely mis - sold @entity16			1
the claims firms typically pocket a third of the compensation paid out			0
this means they stand to make £ 80million this year from a record 165,000 complaints about @entity16			1
mr @entity13 , of @entity19 , @entity20 , said : ‘ they told me i had had a £ 3,500 loan with @entity140 which was astonishing to me because i had never had an account with @entity140			1
’ he described the disruption caused to him and wife @entity143 , 67 , as they rushed to answer the phone so as not to miss a chat with friends or their three grown - up children			0
mr @entity13 said : ‘ once i was out in the garden eating and picking raspberries and had the telephone with me in case the children called			2
i was sat in the sun enjoying myself but one of these blasted companies called me – it was infuriating			0
‘ we ’re all busy rushing around all day long , so when we snatch four minutes by ourselves for a bit of peace and quiet , the last thing you want is to be intruded upon by these irrelevant companies			0
’ his annoyance was doubled because he was registered on the @entity164 , intended to block nuisance calls			0
so the next time mr @entity13 was harassed on behalf of the same claims management company , @entity44 , he said : ‘ i ’m fed up with you calling me			1
if you call me again i ’ll charge you £ 10 a minute for my time			1
’ he recalled : ‘ i hoped and presumed that that would be the end of it , naturally			0
but to my astonishment , a couple of days later , they called me again			0
’ mr @entity13 , who owns call - recording company @entity172 , sent @entity44 an invoice for £ 195 but the company denied it or any marketing company acting on its behalf had called him			1
but as he had recorded the calls , mr @entity13 had proof			1
marketing firm @entity47 , which made the call on @entity16 ’s behalf , settled mr @entity13 ’s claim on september 14 before the case appeared before a judge			1
yesterday @entity44 said : ‘ @entity44 and its suppliers only contact people who have opted in to such approaches			0
we have audited the details regarding the calls to mr @entity13 and have found that he had indeed consented to be contacted			1
‘ we would like to draw a clear line between the two calls to mr @entity13 made on behalf of @entity44 and any other calls he received , which were nothing to do with @entity44 or its suppliers			2
’ mr @entity13 has now set up a website – www.saynotocoldcalls.com – to help other victims , and is appearing on @entity196 ’s @entity195 programme at midday today			2
happy days ! @entity13 , who owns call recording company @entity172 , used his experience in the trade to provide a foolproof prosecution			1

@entity13 billed firm promising @entity16 compensation £ 10 for every minute they wasted of his time
the @entity20 businessman recorded the calls to ensure he had enough proof
@entity47 , which sells referrals to management companies , agree to pay £ 195 plus a £ 25 court fee
victory for the ' little man ' gives hope to millions of other pestered homeowners
@entity13 owns call recording company @entity172 - and this experience aided the prosecution
