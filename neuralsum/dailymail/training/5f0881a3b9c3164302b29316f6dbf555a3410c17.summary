@entity0 won @entity2 gold for @entity3 in the men 's road race on the final day of @entity6 2014			1
@entity0 , the time - trial bronze medallist on thursday , triumphed in torrential rain on the 12 - lap , 168 - kilometres undulating course in a race which became about survival and brute strength			1
the 28 - year - old from @entity14 , who finished the @entity16 last sunday , twice suffered front - wheel punctures , including in the last six kilometres as his rivals neared			1
top dog : @entity3 ' @entity0 won gold in the men 's @entity2 road race on sunday thumbs up : @entity0 recovered from two front - wheel punctures to win his first @entity2 gold but @entity0 soloed to victory by one minute 21 seconds as @entity26 of @entity27 beat @entity28 of @entity29 to silver , the @entity31 having to settle for bronze			1
the @entity34 's @entity33 , who won the island 's only medal of the @entity37 with points race silver on the track , led on his own for 116 kilometres , ultimately in vain			0
@entity41 earlier led an @entity29 one - two ahead of retiring team - mate @entity43 in a thrilling women 's road race			1
tough conditions : the men 's road race was made harder by the non-stop rain during the event with @entity53 , recovering from shoulder surgery , in the team car , @entity33 was the @entity34 's undisputed leader and attacked after 3km			1
the 25 - year - old , who was racing on the second anniversary of his @entity58 team pursuit triumph , was left out of @entity59 's @entity16 squad , responding by winning the @entity61 , the @entity62 and his @entity2 silver in the points race at the sir @entity65			2
@entity33 insisted he had no need to prove a point , that his pedigree was free for all to see , and clearly felt strong			0
he was seen in discussions with @entity53 , who was leaning out of the team car , on the third lap , with the rider 's tactics perhaps being questioned as he ploughed on alone through teeming rain and swirling winds			0
at one point he had to avoid an umbrella blowing across the route and his lead was cut once @entity80 persuaded other teams to share in the chase			0
proud moment : @entity0 stands on the podium alongside @entity26 ( left ) and @entity28 ( right ) the @entity34 was caught by a counter-attack featuring @entity26 , @entity28 and @entity0 , who had earlier required a wheel change due to a puncture , with 49km to go and , perhaps inevitably , slipped back as soon as he was caught			2
the trio led at the bell and it was just a matter of 14km to decide their final podium placings			0
knowing @entity28 has a good kick , @entity0 went early , accelerating on the final ascent of @entity95			2
there was still drama for @entity0 , who required a further front wheel change which was excruciatingly long in the closing moments			2
fortunately for the @entity100 he had built enough of a lead to absorb the losses and go on to win			0
just 14 of the 139 riders took to the last of the 12 laps in horrendous conditions as anyone more than 10 minutes behind the leader on each lap was eliminated .			0

@entity0 wins @entity2 gold in men 's road race
@entity100 suffered front - wheel punctures but managed to last the *distance*
