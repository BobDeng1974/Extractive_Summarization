sinkhole dilemma : crews work on a sinkhole on @entity26 in @entity12 , @entity2 on friday , january 4 , 2013 the cause : the mix of loose sandy soil and century - old leaking water pipes underlying @entity12 's streets have made the area susceptible to such holes , city officials say the first of the recent sinkholes perforating @entity12 was reported on @entity33 when a chasm measuring an estimated 50 feet long and eight feet deep swallowed a neighborhood block , damaging water and gas pipes and forcing more than a dozen residents to evacuate their homes , @entity34 reported last month			1
that neighborhood happens to be one of @entity12 ’s poorest districts and the unexpected sinkhole added to the financial dilemmas hitting low - income residents living in a broke city			2
‘ i thought the world was ending , ’ said one resident , @entity48 , 42 , who recently told the @entity49 that she heard a rumbling on december 31 that sounded like fireworks			0
since that night , more holes have opened up throughout the 50,000 - person city			0
another resident , @entity55 , 33 , told @entity34 in january that she had to move her family to a hotel because construction on the hole that formed on her block was causing her home to shake			0
‘ i 'm hearing literally the dry wall cracking , ’ she said			0
‘ we 've had to change our whole life			0
’ deep holes , shallow pockets : @entity12 is too broke to replace many of the aging pipes and repave its roads as it deals with ongoing budget woes and the looming threat of bankruptcy in addition to the rising number of sinkholes , the struggling city has been unable to fix a sewage treatment plant that has been dumping toxic waste into the @entity79 , which flows into the @entity80 and the @entity81			1
‘ we ca n't do anything right now because no one will lend to us , ’ @entity82 , chairman of the city agency that oversees the treatment facility , told the @entity49			0
@entity12 , which is in default on its debt , is unable to tap into the municipal - debt market , which cities and states use to finance their infrastructure , including bridges , roads and tunnels			0
after city officials rejected a state - sponsored financial recovery plan in july 2011 , @entity12 ‘ was briefly transformed into the @entity99 of @entity2 , ’ the @entity96 wrote in an article published at the time			1
the city ’s financial woes stem in part from a failed plan to borrow $ 350 million to upgrade an enormous trash incinerator			2
that plan fell through in 2010 after the federal government blocked the effort due to the threat of toxic air pollution			0
@entity111 , @entity12 ’s former @entity112 mayor who ran the city for 28 years , brought it to near bankruptcy as the more than $ 500 million in bond deals he oversaw to finance development projects drained the city 's coffers , according to @entity119			1
it would cost nearly half of @entity12 's $ 50 million budget to permanently fix the 41 sinkholes , one city engineer recently estimated			1
other issues : @entity12 has also been unable to fix a sewage treatment plant that has been dumping toxic waste into the @entity79 , which flows into the @entity80 and the @entity81			2
