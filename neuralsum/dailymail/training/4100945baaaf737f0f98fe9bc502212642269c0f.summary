the government is on course to record a surplus in 2017 - 18 as the economic recovery pushes up tax receipts and public spending is reined in , according to the report			1
it would be the first surplus since 2001 and would represent a remarkable turnaround after @entity22 ’s borrowing culminated in a record shortfall of £ 158billion in 2010			1
the report , by the research group @entity25 , will come as a boost to @entity1 ahead of his autumn statement next week			1
@entity28 , chief @entity3 economist at @entity29 , said : ‘ the economy has moved from a state of despair to repair			2
’ the chancellor has said that the @entity3 ’s ‘ hard work is paying off ’ and the country is now ‘ on the path to prosperity ’ following the biggest boom and bust in @entity3 history			2
but the @entity40 last night played down talk of significant giveaways in the statement on december 5			0
‘ the message will be that there is still much more work to do , ’ said a source close to the chancellor			0
‘ that does n’t sound like a giveaway to me			0
’ @entity25 has for a long time been pessimistic about the outlook for the @entity3 and as recently as june was expecting the economy to grow by just 0.2 per cent this year			0
it now expects growth of 1.5 per cent for 2013 and 2.5 per cent in 2014 , and said the government was set to borrow £ 164billion less than previously thought over the next five years			1
but analysts warned that although the deficit was falling , the national debt has soared from around £ 300billion at the turn of the century to more than £ 1.2trillion today – and is expected to top £ 1.6trillion in 2017			1
‘ mr @entity1 will present his fourth autumn statement against a dramatically improved economic backdrop , ’ said @entity60 , chief @entity61 economist at @entity25			2
‘ but the big picture is that the fiscal consolidation still has a long way to go			0
’ mr @entity28 at @entity29 said : ‘ the stronger recovery means that the public finances look better			1
‘ the chancellor will argue that the policy of fiscal consolidation has been vindicated			0
but there is still much to do			0
’ the @entity73 ( pictured ) now expects the economy to grow by 1.6 per cent this year the @entity75 is expected to upgrade its growth forecasts and pencil in lower borrowing when it publishes its latest outlook alongside the statement			2
and the @entity73 now expects the economy to grow by 1.6 per cent this year and 2.8 per cent in 2014 – far more than the 0.6 per cent and 1.8 per cent forecast by the @entity75 in march			0
stronger growth is expected to feed through to the public finances as receipts from @entity85 , income tax and stamp duty rise , and spending on out - of - work benefits falls .			1
