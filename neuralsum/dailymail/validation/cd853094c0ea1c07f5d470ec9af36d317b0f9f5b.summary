spending on the security services could be merged with the defence budget to hit a key @entity5 target , @entity0 indicated yesterday			1
the prime minister is under intense pressure from both his own mps and former generals to guarantee that the @entity10 will continue to spend at least 2 per cent of @entity12 ’s national income on defence			2
a study published yesterday revealed that @entity12 will miss the target by more than £ 2billion next year if current spending plans are maintained			1
missing this figure would be deeply embarrassing for mr @entity0 , who lectured other @entity19 leaders on the need to maintain defence spending at the @entity5 summit in @entity23 last year			1
but he indicated that he could hit the target by re-badging the £ 2billion budget for the security services as defence spending			1
prime minister @entity0 is under fire over claims @entity12 will fail to meet its @entity5 target of spending at least 2 per cent of its national income on defence next year he told @entity34 radio : ‘ i have a responsibility to make sure we make the right decisions about defence and other security spending			1
‘ i look at these things in the round , so i am also concerned about the budget for @entity43 , the @entity44 , @entity45 , counter-terrorism policing			0
to me all of these things are part of our national defence			0
’ a study by the impartial @entity52 yesterday revealed that @entity12 will need to spend an additional £ 2.2billion on defence next year in order to hit the target – and an extra £ 1billion every year after that			1
it added that current plans suggest defence spending will otherwise represent only 1.87 per cent of national income next year			2
but former @entity61 defence minister sir @entity60 condemned the move as a ‘ complete cop - out ’			1
an @entity65 fighter jets was scrambled to escort a @entity68 @entity67 bomber when it flew into @entity12 airspace last month			0
there are fears a defence funding squeeze would leave the @entity12 reluctant to tackle such incursions he said last night : ‘ no amount of fancy footwork or creative accountancy is going to fool anybody			0
adding the security budget to defence will not produce a single extra bullet or soldier			0
‘ it does n’t address the fundamental problem that the @entity12 and our allies face very real threats – a resurgent @entity68 , complete turmoil in the @entity90 and many other threats around the world			0
former @entity61 defence minister sir @entity60 has condemned the move as a ‘ complete cop - out ’ ' if this idea goes ahead it will be seen by all for the gimmick that it is			1
’ mr @entity0 has faced repeated attacks over defence spending from former military leaders			1
the former head of the army , general sir @entity103 , warned that the funding squeeze was leaving the @entity12 reluctant to tackle @entity68 incursions into its airspace and offshore waters			0
another former @entity110 chief , @entity109 , said it would be ‘ extraordinary ’ for a @entity61 government to fail to meet its commitments on defence			0
mr @entity0 yesterday showed his irritation at the comments – suggesting that some vocal critics were speaking out in order to promote their memoirs			0
he said : ‘ obviously they have their own book to talk – sometimes quite literally a book to talk – and sometimes they just want to make their views known			0
’ @entity61 rebels plan to force a @entity129 vote on defence spending tomorrow			2
many are angered mr @entity0 has pledged to spend 0.7 per cent of our income on foreign aid , but will not make a firm commitment to meet the @entity5 target .			2

@entity12 will miss target by more than £ 2billion next year , says new study
@entity0 has suggested re-badging £ 2billion budget for security services
@entity144 has lectured @entity19 leaders on need to maintain defence spending
switch would *potentially* avoid embarrassment for him over @entity5 target
but idea is *branded* ' complete cop - out ' by former @entity61 defence minister
