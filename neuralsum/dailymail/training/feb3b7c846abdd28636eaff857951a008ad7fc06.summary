@entity0 , five , in the wheelchair her mother has to push her to school in everyday a mother may have to withdraw her disabled daughter from school because the local council axed her free taxi transport when she received a wheelchair			1
@entity0 , five , from @entity11 , @entity12 , was diagnosed with cerebral palsy last year and was provided with free transport to take her to and from school			1
but her mother @entity16 claims that since @entity0 now has a wheelchair , @entity18 have said she no longer qualifies for free transport to @entity20			1
the 32 - year - old used to carry @entity0 to school or push her in a buggy until she got too heavy - but when she fell pregnant again she could no longer lift the youngster			1
and since giving birth to seven - week - old baby @entity26 , the mother - of - four finds it impossible to manage her daughter 's wheelchair and a pushchair on the 0.7 mile journey			2
ms @entity33 's mother has volunteered to look after her baby grandson every morning while her daughter tackles the school run with @entity0 and her two older children			1
but the single mother , who is appealing the ruling , said that if she loses she will have no choice but to keep the youngster off school			0
she said : ' after school i have to rely on my eight - year - old pushing the baby in the pram so i can push the wheelchair			2
' and that is n't fair on her - it means she ca n't go to any after school clubs or anything like that because i need her help			0
' i ca n't keep relying on my mum			0
' by law , councils are required to provide transport for primary school children who live more than two miles from their nearest available school			0
ms @entity0 said the county council allocated @entity0 a free taxi for the journey until the end of the school term in july while the family were waiting for a wheelchair			1
but when she contacted the authorities before the start of the new academic year she was told @entity0 did n't meet criteria			2
@entity0 , pictured left and right at home , was initially provided with free transport to and from school , but this was stopped when she received a wheelchair she said : ' if i did n't have a newborn i would n't be asking for help at all - but i ca n't push them both to school			1
@entity0 is too big now			0
' @entity81 , @entity18 's school transport manager , said : ' we do n't discuss individual cases in detail because of confidentiality			1
these cases are often more complicated than they appear and we are still awaiting the outcome of a further appeal			0
' we can offer help with school transport under certain circumstances although assessments must always focus on the needs of the individual child , not the situation of other family members			2
' to qualify for transport help , children are also expected to attend the nearest suitable school to where they live			0
this map shows the nearly one mile route the two must make twice a day to get @entity0 to school and back @entity0 must now be pushed to and from @entity20 ( pictured ) everyday the five - year - old was diagnosed with cerebral palsy last year but her mother is struggling to get her to school ' when an appeal is made it is a chance for both sides to look at the situation afresh and consider any alternatives which may be appropriate			1
' mr @entity116 's father @entity115 , 56 , said : ' i think it is absolutely disgusting really that we have to go through all of this to get a taxi for a child with a disability			0
' we are appealing the decision at the moment but we have to wait until the beginning of october to find out whether she will be granted the free transport or not			0
' but in the mean time it is a real struggle for @entity16 as she has three other children and she ca n't push the wheelchair and the baby 's pram			2
' no one from the council has been out to assess @entity0 - they have just said she does n't fit their criteria , but every child with cerebral palsy is different			1
' it is a bad day when you have to go through all of this			0
the whole situation makes me really angry			0

@entity16 ' daughter @entity0 was diagnosed with cerebral palsy last year
but council axed @entity0 's school transport once she received a wheelchair
she is now struggling to push her daughter to school nearly a mile everyday
if she loses her appeal then she will have to withdraw @entity159 from school
