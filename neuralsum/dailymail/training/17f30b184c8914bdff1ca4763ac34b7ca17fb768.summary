speaking to the @entity28 as part of his @entity22 analysis , @entity0 said : ‘ on sunday , @entity31 played exceptionally well and was trying to bring some sort of stability to their defence with the way he controlled his six - yard box and came for crosses			2
‘ but , whoever is in @entity41 's defence , he does not seem to have enough commanding players who can stand on their own two feet			0
@entity7 and @entity6 played at the back together for the first time this season ‘ he needs a centre - half who can take the team by the scruff of the neck and say " this is what we need to do "			2
that player is not in their squad yet			0
‘ in my time at @entity5 , we always had defenders who were leaders and who took responsibility			0
