a green - fingered pensioner 's attempt to grow shrubs and flowers in his front garden has spectacularly back - fired - after the foliage grew so fast it engulfed his entire house			1
@entity8 's £ 240,000 semi-detached property in posh @entity9 , @entity10 , has become consumed by rampant ivy and conifers , leaving it invisible to passers - by			1
his front garden is so overrun with plants the windows , front door and even the garage are hidden beneath the sprawling greenery			1
one resident , who did not want to be named , said : ' mr @entity8 lives in the house and has done for many years			2
' he is often seen planting flowers and shrubs but the weather this year has sent them skyward			0
' he is a character and usually puts his plants in bags before transferring them into his garden			2
one resident said that the good weather this year has sent the green - fingered pensioner 's foliage up to the sky ' the front garden has also been a bit unruly but this summer the good weather has sent the ivy and conifers shooting up			1
' the house is so hidden you ca n't even see the front door			1
' i feel sorry for the people living directly next door because their home is very nicely kept and has recently been repainted			1
another local said it was unfair for neighours who take care of their home but live next to the unsightly foliage ' i hate to say it but the house has become a bit of an eyesore and the council really should take some action if for no other reason than to help mr @entity8 control his plants			1
' it must be really depressing living like that , it must be very gloomy inside			0
' another neighbour added : ' mr @entity29 is no trouble to us or anyone on the street			1
' his efforts to improve his garden have clearly got away from him and we 'd all happily help him if he wanted us to but i daresay he 's too proud to ask			2
' mr @entity8 took up gardening after retiring from his job as a market trader			0
neighbour and friend @entity90 , 50 , who has known him for 20 years , said : ' @entity8 is a lovely man and a real character			0
' he used to run a market stall in @entity94 selling women 's handbags			0
his front room was always full of stock and he used to put flowers in the bags which he could n't sell			0
' no one minds that his garden is overgrown , it is a bit of a local landmark and probably would n't be the same if he cut it all down			2
' he is a character but very generous			0
when we held a street party for the @entity107 he gave a very generous donation and came out and chatted to everybody			0
' he has always shown an enthusiasm for gardening but it does look like his plants have got away from him a bit			0
' mr @entity8 yesterday refused to comment			0
in february last year homeowner @entity114 , 50 , was fined £ 1,000 after he failed to tidy up the front of his home in @entity117 , @entity118 , which was completely obscured by ivy .			1
