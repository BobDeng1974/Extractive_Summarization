@entity0 and @entity1 are making a play to dominate your car ’s dashboard , but they ’re not the only firms working on the technology			2
at this year ’s @entity9 in @entity10 , chip maker @entity8 is showcasing a @entity11 kitted out with optical and ultrasonic sensors , touchscreen displays and rear - view cameras			1
and with 4g technology built in , the concept car does n’t need a phone to get online so can double up as a @entity19 for all passengers			2
the @entity11 ( pictured ) is on display at this year ’s @entity9 in @entity10 and uses @entity8 technology to power its sensors , camera and on - board modems			1
it has 4g technology built in , so does n't need a phone to get online , and this means it can double up as a @entity19 for all passengers like with @entity0 ’s @entity31 and @entity1 ’s @entity32 , the @entity11 concept has a display that can be used with voice control , touch and hand gestures			1
by default , the screen displays map info , controls , music playback , and phone calls but it also splits into three to show ‘ now playing ’ along the bottom , maps on the top left and media on the top right			0
although the system can sync with smartphones and tablets - and uses a screen mirroring technology called @entity53 - it is more advanced than @entity0 and @entity1 ’s systems because it does n’t need one to work			2
instead it comes with built - in apps and @entity58			0
multiple phones and tablets can then connect to this @entity58 network to share the car ’s ‘ @entity62 ’			2
@entity8 ’s vice president for product management @entity65 told @entity67 it is also developing a system to project phone displays over usb to the head unit			2
the @entity11 ( pictured ) is a concept but @entity8 ’s vice president for product management @entity65 said it showcases the potential for connected cars and believes these kinds of systems will be in cars soon the concept has a display that can be used with voice control , touch and hand gestures			1
by default , the screen displays map info , car controls ( left ) , music playback , and recent calls			0
the system syncs with phones using screen mirroring technology called @entity53 ( right ) but also comes with its own mobile network the @entity11 is also kitted out cameras that provide an almost 360 - degree view of the car and warn of impending collisions , obstacles and more			1
the rear - view camera can additionally be used for parking assist features ( pictured )			1
this technology runs on @entity102 's @entity101 car platform earlier this week @entity103 unveiled its latest app that not only shows how far you can travel on the power you have remaining , it bases its predictions on your unique driving style			2
called @entity109 , it also lets drivers remotely access their vehicles meaning they can set the cabin temperature on a cold morning before they leave their house			0
the app was announced at @entity9 in @entity10 and currently works with a selection of @entity103 ’s electric and hybrid cars			1
it specifically suits electric cars because the app can directly link to the battery to see a status level and accurate mileage			0
but @entity103 spokesman @entity123 told @entity67 the team is working on developing the software for petrol and diesel range			0
elsewhere , the car features a @entity130 wireless charging surface			0
the sensor and camera setup provides an almost 360 - degree view of the car and warns of impending collisions , obstacles and more			1
plus a ‘ digital instrument cluster ’ - or screen behind the wheel - shows the driver information from all the car ’s systems at a glance			2
details about fuel , speed and any technical faults are updated in real - time , including an 8 - inch image from the rear - view parking assist camera to show the road behind			1
and advanced map data plots the road ahead - even if it is beyond the view of the driver			2
this technology runs on the @entity101 car platform which is already running in more than 20 million vehicles			0
at the same time , a network of sensors work together to boost driver safety			0
these include a light detection and ranging ( @entity164 ) sensor that shows a forward - facing collision warnings up to 164ft ( 50 metres )			1
a set of ultrasonic and optical sensors near each wing mirror spot pedestrians , cyclists , and obstacles in the blind spots , helping the driver make safer lane changes and turns			1
a set of ultrasonic and optical sensors near each wing mirror ( pictured ) spot pedestrians , cyclists , and obstacles in the blind spots , helping the driver make safer lane changes and turns a ‘ digital instrument cluster ’ - or screen behind the wheel - shows the driver information from all the car ’s systems at a glance plus navigation details ( pictured )			1
these details are updated in real - time and advanced map data plots the road ahead - even if it is beyond the view of the driver the mirrors show real - time video footage to offer a wide field of view , plus a warning bar that goes from green ( shown ) to red when an obstacle approaches and the mirrors themselves show real - time video footage offering a wider field of view than traditional mirrors			1
meanwhile , the rear - view camera , with ultrasonic proximity sensors , provides an unobstructed view of what ’s coming up from behind			1
and when a warning is made it appears on a strip of leds on the windshield			0
this means , for example , that if a driver starts indicating right but it is n’t safe to move over - if a cyclist is approaching for example , or they ’re too close to a car - the strip will glow red			0
if it ’s safe to move over or change lanes , the light glows green			0
a similar system is used on the wing mirrors to warn of nearby obstacles			1
the car is a concept but mr @entity65 said it showcases the potential for connected cars and believes these kinds of sensors and systems will be in vehicles in the near future			0
@entity0 firm first toyed with an in - car system at its @entity242 in june 2013			0
at that point it was known as ' @entity31 ' but following changes in the design team the system was unveiled at last year 's @entity248 , under the moniker @entity31 ( @entity250 on @entity31 pictured ) elsewhere @entity1 used its annual developer @entity252 in june to unveil @entity32 auto , a key feature of its latest operating system @entity255			0
@entity32 works with any @entity32 phone to show a user 's information on the dashboard ( @entity260 on @entity32 pictured )			0

the car is on display at this year ’s @entity9 in @entity10
@entity11 uses @entity8 technology to power its sensors and cameras
lidar provides collision warnings up to 164ft ( 50 metres ) ahead
ultrasonic and optical sensors on side mirrors spot pedestrians , cyclists , and obstacles in blind spots
rear - view camera and sensors beam unobstructed view of behind the car
and wing mirrors are *replaced* with real - time video footage
