@entity0 : anguish and triumph by @entity2 not many great men have been arrested as a tramp			1
but it happened more than once to @entity0 , because of his slovenly appearance			1
he would shout down the police cells with rage , ‘ i am @entity0 ’ , until he was identified and released			1
such stories encapsulate the problem of understanding him ; so great a composer , so impossible and so unhappy a man			1
@entity0 seems to have lived his whole life over the top			1
in his frequent rages , as in his loves and his music , he was volcanic			2
genius can not be comfortable to live with			2
as this massive , but fascinating , biography shows , @entity0 quarrelled even with his best friends , invariably chose unattainable women to love and drove his ‘ son ’ — his nephew , @entity26 , to whom he was guardian — to attempt suicide			1
without fail , @entity0 fell for much younger girls ( 17 was a favourite age ) of aristocratic birth , usually titled , often married of course , the central tragedy of his life was his deafness , crippling to most composers , which he spent his adult life defying			1
more and more , he composed in his head , in a state of creative trance that he called his ‘ raptus ’			2
his deafness began in one of his rages at being disturbed			2
he fell flat on his face with fury			2
‘ when i got up , i found i was deaf , and have been ever since			2
his hearing partially returned , but accompanied by tinnitus , a constant hissing and buzzing in one or both ears			2
as sufferers , like myself , know only too well , it is incurable			2
‘ i would be happy , perhaps the happiest of mortals , if that fiend had not settled in my ears , ’ he wrote to a doctor friend			0
his pupil , @entity57 , described how , one day , he found @entity0 on a sofa with an unknown young woman at first , he found it impossible to tell people ‘ i am deaf ’ , for fear it would ruin his reputation as the top - ranking virtuoso pianist and improviser in @entity67			1
he became famous almost from the start ; his genius was evident to the music - loving @entity67			2
when deafness struck , he withdrew in embarrassment from public performance and society in general			0
yet he carried on conducting the premieres of his new works — with more and more erratic results , as he could not hear the orchestra properly			0
eventually , a substitute conductor would stand behind him , keeping the players together , while they did their best to ignore @entity0 ’s antics			1
of course , he could not hear the applause of the audience			0
he had to be turned around in order to see it			0
as well as increasing deafness , @entity0 suffered chronic ill - health			1
his biographer lists his complaints : colitis , vomiting and constant diarrhoea , rheumatic fever , jaundice , hepatitis and cirrhosis of the liver — and an attack of typhus in his early years may have undermined his health			0
@entity2 thinks he may have made his digestive troubles far worse by drinking quantities of cheap wine , which contained lead			0
but his short , squat , swarthy body was remarkably sturdy in standing up to all of this			0
he died of liver failure at the age of 56 , a longish life for those times			0
it was sheer bloody - minded defiance that got him through , and which fought off his despair and frequent thoughts of suicide			2
‘ i will seize @entity117 by the throat — it shall not bend or crush me			0
’ @entity0 was lonely , but his loneliness was self - inflicted he was lonely , but his loneliness was self - inflicted			1
his patrons were all @entity67 aristocrats , led by the emperor ’s brother , the @entity121 , who was his prize pupil			2
he and a couple of other princes clubbed together to provide @entity0 with a steady income — which was sometimes late in being paid , to @entity0 ’s loud complaint			1
to one of his patrons , he wrote , ‘ @entity130 ! what you are , you are by circumstance and by birth			2
what i am , i am through myself			0
of princes there have been thousands ; of @entity0 there is only one			1
’ ugly as he was , @entity0 easily attracted women			1
his pupil , @entity57 , described how , one day , he found @entity0 on a sofa with an unknown young woman			1
@entity57 had come for a lesson			1
@entity0 waved him to the piano : ‘ play something romantic ’			1
@entity57 obliged , averting his eyes from the sofa			1
‘ something passionate ! ’ urged @entity0			1
@entity57 played on , until the woman made off			1
@entity0 said he had no idea who she was — she had knocked on the door and asked to see him			1
this happened , apparently , quite often			0
but his real love life , confined to three or four women , was a disaster			0
without fail , he fell for much younger girls ( 17 was a favourite age ) of aristocratic birth , usually titled , often married — hopeless prospects			1
@entity2 gives short shrift to the love life in a book of more than 1,000 pages			0
he is a stickler for evidence , and we are short of hard evidence			0
there has been endless speculation , especially over the letter to ‘ the @entity174 ’ , which @entity0 never sent , but was found among his personal talismans after his death			1
this letter , almost incoherent in its longing — ‘ my thoughts rush towards you			0
i can only live either wholly with you or not at all ’ — suggests he was on his way to meet the beloved near @entity184 in @entity185 in the summer of 1812			0
but who was she ? the style of the letter resembles that of the letters he sent to @entity191 , a young , widowed countess , nearly ten years earlier			0
not many great men have been arrested as a tramp			1
but it happened more than once to @entity0 , because of his slovenly appearance his anguished longings for her seemed to have been frustrated by her reluctance ( in her letters ) to go to bed with him , and her wish that , ‘ if only you loved me less sensually ’			1
@entity2 sticks to the fact that they had parted five years before , and she had told her servants not to admit him anymore			0
there was no evidence that she was anywhere nearby when he wrote the letter to the immortal beloved			0
a t least three other possible candidates are considered and dismissed as unlikely fits			0
there is plenty of evidence to suggest that he satisfied his sexual demands in @entity67 ’s fashionable brothels — along with some of his jocular men friends			0
but true love he had to abandon as an impossibility			0
he was alone with his deafness , which is why he sought a substitute family in his nephew @entity26 , the son of his brother , @entity229 , who made him the boy ’s guardian before he died			0
years that could have been spent in creation were eaten up by @entity0 ’s attempts to keep the boy from his mother , whom he regarded as wicked and a whore			1
‘ he is my son : i am his true father , ’ @entity0 declared , and he tried to shape the boy as he would a piece of music			1
the predictable result was that @entity26 , suffocating in his teenage years , ran away , leaving @entity0 in tears ( ‘ he is ashamed of me ! ’ )			1
then , he heard that @entity26 had tried , but failed , to kill himself , by attempting to shoot himself in the head with not one , but a pair of pistols			0
@entity0 ’s attempts to be a father ended in remorse			1
indeed , there is more anguish than triumph in the story told here			0
the triumph is given due weight in music			0
@entity2 gives a thorough description and analysis of all the major works			0
he is a music academic , but also a composer			2
his comments are full of insight			0
he traces the development from @entity0 ’s heroic period , through sadness , to the final mystic realm of the last quartets			2
at every stage , @entity0 stretched the bounds of music and of performance			2
this book is a monument			0
though a long read , it is always rewarding , dealing as it does with a fascinating mystery — where does great music come from ? how is it inspired ? it certainly came out of suffering in @entity0 ’s case			1
but it also ended with an ode to @entity283 .			0

@entity0 was arrested more than once because he looked like a tramp
the great composer was lonely , but his loneliness was self - inflicted
his pupil , @entity57 , once found @entity0 on a sofa with a woman
