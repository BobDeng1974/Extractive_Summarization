it is believed his weight triggered an avalanche 650ft wide			1
a male friend skiing on a different slope above mr @entity3 escaped unscathed			2
scrambled : an @entity82 helicopter is pictured helping in the search on saturday and sunday a team of rescuers was scrambled to the area , close to the @entity87 , at 1pm on saturday , where they began a desperate search			0
@entity91 , leader of the @entity92 , said : ‘ the avalanche came down into a gully well over 60ft in depth , so the snow was very deep and compressed			2
‘ it had turned to ice and had a lot of boulders in it to dig through , which is why the rescue went on for so long			0
@entity92 said the avalanche travelled about 1,000ft down a rocky face of a slope an @entity82 has been helping rescuers with the search effort , which continued into @entity106 harsh conditions : the search focused on an area ' off the piste ' near to the @entity87 ‘ we found @entity3 ’s gear , his hat and gloves , so we had a good assumption of where his body would be but had to abandon the search overnight on saturday			1
the next day we located his boots and dug him out			0
’ by the time the search resumed at 8am yesterday , it was known mr @entity3 would not have survived			2
it was a recovery operation for the 50 - strong team from @entity13 and @entity122 mountain rescue teams , @entity121 and a rescue helicopter			1
mr @entity91 added : ‘ it was a pity it was such a sad outcome but that is the way it is with avalanches – not many people survive them			0
i knew @entity3 when he was young and he was a vastly experienced skier			2

' i was up there from about 10am and at lunchtime we went in to get something to eat at the cafe and we saw an emergency helicopter hovering about , ' he said			0
' it looked as though it was coming in to land near the bottom of the hill			0
when we were leaving later i saw police and mountain rescue vans all gathered as well			0
members of @entity68 said they were devastated by the news			0
one , who did not want to be named , said : ‘ @entity43 was the one who taught me to ski , he was a great teacher			0
we all went out onto the mountain today because it ’s what he would have wanted			0
