by @entity0 a nurse who was left fighting for her life after being trampled by cows was at first branded a hoax caller when she desperately dialled 999 for help			1
@entity6 suffered serious injuries including broken arms , a broken collarbone , broken jaw and several broken ribs during the incident in a field near @entity14 last november			1
a recording of her distress call has been shared online , and it reveals how the @entity18 call handler dealt with the badly injured lady			1
scroll down for audio agony : ms @entity6 ( left ) was left with serious injuries after the incident near @entity24 ( right ) the call taker is heard to say ' this is a hoax , is n’t it , obviously ' , after questioning the woman about where she was and what had happened to her			1
but the call was n’t a hoax			2
@entity6 nearly died and was in intensive care at @entity34 for two and a half weeks			1
the full call , which is 49 minutes long , stops when officers arrive to help her			2
@entity6 was eventually taken to @entity34			1
the woman , who was 59 - years - old old at the time , had been out on a hi - tech treasure hunt when she was trampled by cows in a field off @entity24 at @entity41 , eight miles from @entity42			1
she managed to call 999 , and was eventually found after police traced her mobile phone signal			1
but in a recording of the call , which was posted on @entity48 by @entity50 presenter @entity49 , ms @entity6 desperately struggles to explain what has happened to her			1
after asking @entity6 what was happening and getting some broken responses , the call operator asks where in @entity56 she is calling from			1
the call operator then says : ' this is a hoax , is n’t it , obviously			2
which area of @entity56 , we will get your mobile phone checked			1
' critical : ms @entity6 's injuries included broken arms , a broken collarbone , broken jaw and several broken ribs @entity6 was walking in a field with her dog when the group of animals charged , leaving her with life - threatening injuries			1
now doing research two days a week , a generous @entity6 said she did not bear the operator any ill will despite her somewhat unsympathetic tone			1
' i presume i could n't talk properly because of my broken jaw , ' she said			0
' i broke all of my ribs down my left side i believe , and was in intensive care for two and half weeks			2
' @entity6 was carrying a hand held gps but assumes the device was knocked out of her reach by the cows			1
' i can not remember , but i think because of all my breaks and everything i was in terrible pain so i probably could n't move very much either			0
' @entity6 added : ' it happened in a field , it was a public footpath through a field in @entity41 , near @entity14			1
i was n't actually using my phone , it was a handheld gps , i think it was a circular walk of about four miles			0
' i suffered lots of broken bones , particularly to my arms and chest , so it was both arms , my collar bone , my jaw , most of my ribs on my left side			2
' somebody said i remembered where i had parked the car and it was n't far from there , ' @entity6 said			1
' basically they saved my life			2
' @entity6 ’s pet @entity120 was uninjured after she ran off when around a dozen cows charged at them			1
her brother , @entity123 , found the petrified dog cowering in a bush the following day			0
most members of the public are wary of bulls , but few realise that cows , particularly those protecting newly - born calves , can also be dangerous			1
if you find yourself in a field of suddenly wary cattle , move away as carefully and quietly as possible , and if you feel threatened by cattle then let go of your dog ’s lead and let it run free rather than try to protect it and endanger yourself			2
the dog will outrun the cows and it will outrun you			2
those without canine companions should follow similar advice : move away calmly , do not panic and make no sudden noises			0
chances are the cows will leave you alone once they establish that you pose no threat			0
if you walk through a field of cows and there happen to be calves , think twice ; if you can , go another way and avoid crossing fields			2
source : @entity155 @entity6 , from @entity156 , @entity157 , had been ‘ geocaching ’ - an internet - based high - tech treasure hunt which uses gps			1
at the time a @entity18 spokesman confirmed : ' we received a call from a woman saying she had been injured and was lying in a field			2
' she said she had been hurt when cows stampeded and knocked her over			0
' although she did n’t know exactly where she was , within half - an - hour her car was located at @entity41 cemetery			0
' and she was found in the field off @entity24 in the village soon after			0
' in a statement @entity173 said : ' call takers are trained to establish key information as quickly as possible			0
' the audio clip only covers the initial few minutes of the call and does not give the full picture of how the injured lady was dealt with			0
' the call lasted 48 minutes in total and all the time the caller was being spoken to , background work was going on to try to establish her exact location			0
' there was never any delay in the police ’s response to the incident and everything was done with urgency to find where the caller was			0
whilst all the work was being undertaken to locate the lady , the call taker kept talking to her to keep her calm and reassured , gaining as much information as possible from her			0
she was kept on the line until help arrived			0
' geocaching involves hiding a small waterproof box containing a logbook and a pen , recording its co-ordinates and logging its location on a website			0
another ‘ cacher ’ will see the listing , enter the co-ordinates into their gps receiver and go in search of it			0
it is similar to the 150 - year - old game letterboxing , which uses clues and references to landmarks embedded in stories			0
geocaching was invented in 2000 when gps readings became more accurate			0
in total there are two million geocaches all over the world and more than five million people take part in the activity globally .			0
