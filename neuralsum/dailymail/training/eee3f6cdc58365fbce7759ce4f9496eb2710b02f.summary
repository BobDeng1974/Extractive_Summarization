published : 14:00 est , 15 november 2012 updated : 03:05 est , 16 november 2012 man began hunting with stone - tipped spears half a million years ago - 200,000 years earlier than previously thought , according to a new study			1
scientists have discovered our ancestors began hunting with stone - tipped spears 500,000 years ago - with the help of a special crossbow and a dead springbok			1
up until recently , it was thought attaching a stone tip to a spear - known as ' hafting ' - started about 300,000 years ago			2
experimental hafted points from a @entity15 - led study created by researchers to test how effective spears were however , by comparing the wear visible on 500,000 - year - old stone points found in @entity21 with modern experimental points fired by a specially calibrated crossbow at a springbok carcass , scientists proved they had been used as spear tips for hunting			1
' @entity27 ' was an important technological advance that made it possible to handle or throw sharp points with much more power and control			0
leader author @entity33 , a phd candidate in the @entity34 at the @entity15 in @entity35 , said the research suggested stone - tipped spears could have been in use before the divergence of early humans and @entity40			1
she said : ' this changes the way we think about early human adaptations and capacities before the origin of our own species			0
' although both @entity40 and humans used stone - tipped spears , this is the first evidence that the technology originated prior to or near the divergence of these two species			2
' attaching stone points to spears was an important advance in hunting weaponry for early humans			2
a 500,000 spear tip found in @entity59 1 in @entity21 the team built a catapult to test how effective the spear making technique was hafted tools require more effort and planning to manufacture , but a sharp stone point on the end of a spear can increase its killing power			1
hafted spear tips are common in @entity72 archaeological sites after 300,000 years ago			0
the new study - which examined 500,00 - year - old stone points from the @entity21 archaeological site of @entity77 1 - shows that they were also used in the early @entity79 , a period associated with @entity80 , the last common ancestor of @entity40 , and modern humans			1
ms @entity33 and colleagues from @entity84 and the @entity85 , compared the ancient stone points to experimental points which they hafted to wooden dowels using @entity91 resin and sinew before thrusting them into a springbok with a mounted crossbow			0
the method has been used effectively to study weaponry from more recent contexts in the @entity98 and southern @entity21			2
the stone points exhibit certain types of breaks that occur more commonly when they are used to tip spears compared to other uses			0
' the archaeological points have damage that is very similar to replica spear points used in our spearing experiment , ' said ms @entity33			0
the researchers tested hundreds of stones to find those which were effective as spear tips ' this type of damage is not easily created through other processes			1
' it now looks like some of the traits that we associate with modern humans and our nearest relatives can be traced further back in our lineage			0
' the findings were published in the journal @entity126 .			0

500,000 year - old tips were found in @entity21
researchers tested their theory using a specially built catapult which fired replica spears into a dead springbok
