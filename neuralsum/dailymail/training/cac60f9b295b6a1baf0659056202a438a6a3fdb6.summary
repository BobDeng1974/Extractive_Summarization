@entity0 last night risked civil war in his party as he insisted @entity3 should not rejoin the @entity5 group in the @entity6 unless he apologises over sexual harassment allegations			1
it came as a former party activist , who claims to have been the victim of ‘ scary ’ unwanted advances after @entity3 trapped her in a room , attacked the party for letting him get off scot - free			1
party leader mr @entity0 ’s comments came after he was warned that he would face a rebellion by @entity5 peers if he tried to remove the party whip from @entity3			1
alleged victim @entity19 ( left ) said @entity3 ( right ) had touched her intimately			1
she added that the party had carried out a secretive inquiry which failed to properly investigate whether the peer had brought the @entity5 into disrepute , leaving no one satisfied under party rules , peers would have to ratify any such decision			1
peers are due to meet on monday when @entity3 is expected to be welcomed back into the fold			1
and mr @entity0 was placed under further pressure last night after more than 100 @entity5 activists signed a letter urging him to demand the withdrawal of the whip from @entity3 if he fails to apologise			1
the letter ’s signatories include the party ’s youth wing , @entity38 , former parliamentary candidates and local councillors			0
last night , a @entity5 spokesman said : ‘ @entity0 is of the view that , as long as @entity3 refuses the very reasonable request from @entity44 to apologise , that it is inappropriate for him to rejoin the @entity5 group in the @entity6			1
' @entity0 has communicated this to the chief whip and @entity51 group			1
’ this week @entity3 escaped punishment over the sexual harassment claims , despite the party ’s inquiry finding the evidence against him was ‘ credible ’			2
the former @entity5 chief executive was told to apologise to the women who had complained			2
but in a humiliating blow to mr @entity0 , he refused to say sorry			2
@entity0 last night risked civil war in his party as he insisted @entity3 should not rejoin the @entity5 group in the @entity6 unless he apologises over sexual harassment allegations alleged victim @entity19 said the party had carried out a secretive inquiry which had failed to properly investigate whether the peer had brought the @entity5 into disrepute , leaving no one satisfied			1
another alleged victim , @entity68 , described the result of the investigation as ‘ deeply depressing ’			1
she said : ‘ the party has found itself sitting in an absurd @entity71 where it is unable to install a sanction against @entity3 but instead can ask him to apologise to us			2
something he very clearly has no plans to do ... we should look to @entity0 to firm up his position and show some of his moral courage			2
that would involve an ultimatum			0
’ and a third alleged victim , @entity5 parliamentary candidate @entity84 , told the party leadership to ‘ man up ’ and take action over @entity3			1
yesterday miss @entity19 told @entity89 ’s @entity90 that she had made complaints about @entity3 ’s ‘ inappropriate behaviour ’ on two occasions , five years apart			1
the first was in 2002 when she was ‘ very young , very green and new to the @entity5 ’			2
it made her feel ‘ very uncomfortable ’ but at that time he accepted that she had said no. ‘ i asked around and people said , “ oh yes stay away from @entity3 – he has a bit of a reputation as a lech ”			2
but it ’s easier said than done ; it ’s a workplace			0
’ five years later he made advances again but she said ‘ the problem this time is that he really did not want to take no for an answer ’			0
she said he touched her intimately			0
she added : ‘ i felt trapped in that room			0
he said i could n’t leave – it actually turned out to be quite a scary experience			0
i had to raise my voice and threaten to call the police			0
‘ it ’s one thing to be working with someone who ’s a bit of a lech , it ’s another thing if you ’re actually feeling your safety is under threat			0
’ she said she did not immediately go to the police because , having a law degree , she knew the police would not see it as a criminal matter			0
she went on to criticise the @entity5 investigation			0
she said : ‘ it satisfied nobody ... they ’ve failed completely to look at this issue of whether he brought the party into disrepute or not			0
‘ i ’m absolutely with people who complain about the secrecy of the whole thing			0
there has to be a due process , it has to be at least some degree of transparency			0

@entity0 is warned he faces rebellion by @entity5 peers if he tried to remove the party whip from @entity3
