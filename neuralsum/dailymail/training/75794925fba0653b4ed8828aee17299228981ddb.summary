by @entity0 published : 00:04 est , 12 september 2012 updated : 13:52 est , 12 september 2012 a jobless mother - of - four who starred in a @entity4 documentary about life on a ' shameless ' - style council estate claims the @entity8 made her look worse than she really is			1
@entity10 , 44 , sparked outrage amongst millions of viewers after being filmed saying : ' i ’ve got better things to do than go jogging down here looking for a job ' , whilst pocketing up to £ 1,100 a month in benefit handouts			2
the show entitled ‘ @entity18 ’ was screened last night on @entity19 and portrayed life on @entity20 in @entity21 , @entity22 , as miserable			1
mrs @entity10 , other estate residents and local councillors have now hit back at the @entity19 saying the @entity4 investigation had contrived to liken @entity20 to @entity38 's drama @entity39			1
mrs @entity10 , a former teaching assistant , who has four children by three different fathers , was filmed explaining why she had not worked for eight years and admitting smoking cannabis at home to ' chill out '			0
when her local job centre asked her to attend a meeting about her continuing unemployment she declared she was ' p * * * * d off ' at having to get a bus into town and appeared to express relief when she returned home still jobless on the show			0
gritty : a grab from @entity4 's trouble on the @entity58 investigation , broadcast last night , which purports to give an honest depiction of life on one of @entity63 's most run down social housing districts ' misrepresented ' : youths wearing tracksuits and hooded tops - all with their hoods up - mill about at recreation ground she also blamed the authorities for one of her children being excluded from school and was given two skips , free paint and wallpaper to clean and spruce up her home			1
' on the sick ' : @entity10 outside her home on @entity20 the show also claimed mrs @entity10 was given ' parental skills ' by social workers , which included how to put her son to bed			0
her daughter ’s unruly behaviour was said to be so bad that council officials threatened the family with eviction			0
after the programme , viewers claimed she ' made their blood boil ' and branded her a ' moaning minnie ' for complaining about her life on the @entity20 in @entity21 , @entity22			1
but today mrs page who has lived in and around the estate for 20 years said : ' i ’m not happy about the " ca n’t be a * * * d jogging to the @entity102 " because they did n’t explain why i could n’t work			0
' the fact is i have been put on the sick because i ’m struggling physically because of depression			0
the programme was edited in a way that did n’t show that			1
' they did n’t put that i have been through domestic violence and i have low self esteem and when i go to the @entity102 they make me feel low and dirty and it ’s degrading			0
mrs @entity10 added : ' i have n’t put my @entity114 on yet , i do n’t think i can face it but anybody who knows me knows that i tell it how it is and i do n’t give a flying f * * k what people think			0
' residents insist the @entity4 show was one - sided and purposely focused on the negatives			1
some accused the broadcaster of encouraging local youths to look more menacing than they actually are			2
police raid a man 's home on the segment of the documentary dealing with the estate 's drug problems			1
residents say the @entity19 have played up negative aspects of life there honest ? the @entity19 denies claims its journalists ' sexed up ' their findings for effect councillor @entity141 said : ‘ as someone who has lived in @entity20 for the past fourteen years , i am horrified			1
they chose @entity144 as an easy target			1
‘ constituents tell me of young lads being asked to pull their hoods up “ for effect ” , and working people being edited out simply because they work			0
i despair if this is true			0
’ he added he was worried that the @entity19 had simply tried to make @entity144 appear like @entity38 ’s sink estate drama @entity39			1
mr @entity141 explained : ‘ i sincerely hope this does n’t look like an episode of @entity39 , because it could set my ward back twenty years			0
’ speaking to local papers , @entity159 and @entity160 , from the @entity161 ’ and @entity133 ’ @entity162 , said they had been ' misled ' by programme makers and regretted agreeing to take part			1
named and @entity165 : the estate says it has unfairly been portrayed as a sink estate like that in @entity38 's @entity39 she said : ‘ they have scandalised our home			2
the film makers asked me for help			0
i was concerned but they promised they would highlight the positives and give a fair picture			0
when i saw the title i felt i had been misled and the estate was being misrepresented			0
‘ there are lots of good things in @entity20 , investment and many good people			0
we run many clubs and events at the community centre - jobs clubs , breakfast clubs for older people , support for those with mental , drug and alcohol problems			1
’ mrs @entity160 insisted that while the area was deprived , the crime rate had fallen for three consecutive years and feared the @entity4 programme could impact house prices , local investment and community morale			1
today @entity21 mp @entity198 vowed to complain to @entity19 governors about the programme claiming it portrayed @entity144 as if it was ' an uncharted part of @entity200 '			1
he said : ' i shall be writing a strongly - worded complaint to the @entity203 about this film			0
it is unacceptable to send a reporter from @entity207 who then treats @entity144 like a @entity209 explorer in an uncharted part of @entity200			1
bleak : the estate was deliberately portrayed in a negative light , say residents set up ? the @entity4 investigation has attracted strong criticism from locals shameless : @entity20 residents say the @entity19 has tried to make their town look like the area featured in the @entity38 sink estate drama ( pictured ) ' the estate does have problems , but so do many others everywhere else in @entity63			1
they viewed @entity144 through the eyes of a handful of well - known dysfunctional families and implied everybody on the estate shares that outlook			1
' the few positives mentioned were simply fig - leaves			0
the film badly misrepresented the lifestyles of the great majority on the estate , and sought to sensationalise its problems			2
' i have spent 33 years as its mp , and know the area extremely well			1
it went through serious problems in the 80s and early 90s - just as many similar areas did when much of manufacturing collapsed			2
' but the area has improved significantly since then			2
as for " drugs , anti-social behaviour , family break - ups , and joblessness " - such circumstances are not confined to classic estates			0
' but these days there is overall much better social behaviour , and significantly less crime			0
' a @entity4 spokesman said : ' it is categorically untrue that the programme team sought to influence the behaviour of anyone they filmed , and certainly did n’t ask them to put up hoods , as is evident from the youngsters featured in the film			2
' we did n’t edit out anybody on the basis that they worked			0
indeed , working people are featured in the film			0
' regarding the comments made by @entity275 , the spokesman said : ' the programme quoted @entity10 explaining why she ca n't work because of illness and the programme made clear that she has suffered domestic violence			2
' when she spoke to the programme makers this morning she said that she was happy with it and her contribution to it			2
' in response to the comments made by mr @entity198 : ' we stand by the programme as a fair and balanced portrayal of life on the estate			1
' all of the main contributors to the programme have said that they are both happy with it and their contribution to it			2
' indeed the programme makers have been thanked by some residents			1
we spent many months on the estate and reflected both what we were told and what we filmed , including the view of the police			0
' however , the many residents we spoke to told us that anti-social behaviour and drugs are a real problem there			2
whilst the programme makers are happy to defend their journalism , they believe that the criticism it is currently receiving deflects attention from the issues which are of genuine concern to many residents on the estate and the wider public			1
' video : ' trouble on the @entity58 ' follows peoples lives in some of @entity63 's poorest housing estates			0

@entity328 *suggested* the area is riddled with *vandalism* , drink and drug problems
the @entity19 insisted they have not ' sexed ' up the documentary
