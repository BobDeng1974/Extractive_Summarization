surrounded by 25 acres of parkland and boasting its own clock tower , stables and servants ’ quarters , @entity0 was expected to attract offers of more than £ 2million			1
but six years after it first went on the market the birthplace of former prime minister sir @entity11 has gone for just a fraction of its original valuation and sold for just £ 241,000			1
the extraordinary drop in price belies its great history and grandeur and makes it one of the most spectacular property bargains in recent years			1
piece of history : @entity0 is thought to have been valued at nearly £ 2million just a few years ago sign of distinction : the 19th - century clocktower would have been in place when former prime minister @entity11 was born here deserted for years : the house has not been used since 2003 , when a local authority school moved out because it needed major repairs elegant decor : one of several ornate ceilings within the beautiful building in 2010 , @entity31 refused the proposals by a developer who wanted to build luxury homes on the site opulent fashion : classical mouldings shaped like swirling leaves and baskets of flowers decorate walls and ceilings throughout the mansion last night , its new owners , who have chosen to remain anonymous , vowed : ‘ it is a private home which is going to be renovated back to its original splendour			1
’ but not everyone was as pleased to see the sale go through			2
the local council , which owns and sold the grade - ii listed country pile , has been accused of ‘ frittering ’ away money amid claims that one prospective buyer offered £ 1.5million for the property			1
the claims , which have been denied by the council , means the property could have been under - sold by £ 1.25million			1
the charming house features grand staircases , doric order columns and 12 bay windows at the front generations of happy families : @entity66 as viewed from the former pleasure gardens with the clocktower in the background the @entity66 has a billiard room , a library with a dummy bookcase leading to its gallery and a drawing room affluent past : staff quarters and a stable are situated in the extensive grounds born at the hall : @entity11 was born at @entity80 in 1897 , before going on to become conservative prime minister in the fifties and while the picturesque home , located near the @entity85 village of @entity86 , is said to need urgent repairs costing an estimated £ 3million one critic insisted the council had still sold it far too cheaply			1
county councillor @entity91 said : ‘ the property was on the market for a figure approaching £ 2million in 2007			2
‘ the council was offered £ 1.5million in the same year , but they turned this offer down			2
it is a massive , massive property , with ornate period features			2
‘ even in today ’s climate the land itself should be worth at least £ 4,000 an acre making the parkland alone worth £ 100,000			1
i think the sale for this price is totally wrong			2
’ the 19th century hall was first built in 1835 , incorporating a section of the rear wing which dated back to 1750			2
designed by architect @entity110 and built for @entity111 , the property was the 1897 birthplace of the former @entity115 prime minister sir @entity11 who led the country between 1955 and 1957			0
his family sold the hall in the 1920s and it was later used as a prisoner of war camp before becoming a school for youngsters with emotional and behavioural difficulties gorgeous setting : @entity80 lies within 25 acres of lush parkland grand interior : the hall boasts a library with dummy bookshelf , many original staircases and fireplaces - but needs major repairs upstairs downstairs : the northern elevation of the former staff accommodation glorious countryside : an earlier prospective buyer wanted to build luxury flats on the site - but the new owners intend to restore the home to its former splendour enduring designs : map showing the listed buildings in and around the 19th - century home but following the need for extensive repairs the school relocated several years ago to a purpose - built site two miles away , leaving the hall empty			1
in 2006 @entity154 , faced with an £ 81,000 annual bill to maintain the hall , decided to sell up to a property developer who planned to turn the hall into luxury flats			0
' as the hall is a grade ii * listed building , we were obliged by law to protect and maintain it while it was under our ownership			0
however , the proposals were rejected by @entity31			0
after the deal fell through the council began looking at alternative options when it received an expression of interest which finally led to its sale			0
the @entity174 home has a billiard room , a library with a dummy bookcase leading to its gallery , stables , separate staff quarters and many original marble fireplaces			1
a spokesman for @entity31 said it was of the ‘ most historically significant buildings in the @entity185 ’ , adding : ‘ we are pleased new owners have been found and look forward to working with them and the council			0
’ from @entity190 to blackboards : an extension was added on to @entity80 when parts of it became a school between 1957 and 2003 @entity0 was built in 1835 and instantly became one of the region 's grandest stately homes			0
it was commissioned by @entity190 @entity200 , to replace his 16th - century manor , and designed by architect @entity110			1
on the death of the fifth @entity190 in 1844 , the estate and @entity190 passed to his cousin , sir @entity204 , the fourth @entity205 , who became high sheriff of @entity85 in 1848			0
@entity11 was born there in 1897 and later served as a cabinet minister before becoming prime minister from 1955 to 1957			0
the estate was then used as a prisoner of war camp for female @entity213 prisoners during the @entity214			1
afterwards it was adapted by the council to serve as a school for youngsters with emotional and behavioural difficulties for nearly 50 years , between 1957 and 2006			0
@entity220 added an unlisted extension to the building in the seventies , but was forced to relocate several years ago after the hall fell into disrepair			0
a buyer then became interested in developing the land for luxury flats , but the deal fell through and the house has only now been sold to an unnamed buyer , who plans to restore it to its former splendour .			0

the 25 - acre grounds contain stables and staff quarters
boasts billiard room , library and original fireplaces
it was used as a *pow* camp during @entity214
