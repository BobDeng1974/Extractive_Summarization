@entity0 has the backing of @entity3 players to replace @entity4 should the club sack the under - fire manager			1
@entity4 's future at the @entity8 is under scrutiny following a largely disappointing campaign			1

@entity3 players have backed @entity0 ( left ) to replace @entity4 as manager of the club - if the latter at the helm of the @entity8 outfit is sacked at the end of the season @entity0 is highly - respected among the @entity3 players and his work with the youth team has n't gone unnoticed too despite winning two trophies last season , @entity4 will end this campaign without any silverware at @entity3 a thumping 4 - 2 defeat at bitter rivals @entity28 on april 12 has increased the pressure on @entity4 the @entity8 outfit failed to reach the quarter - finals of the @entity32 too after losing to @entity33 and a collective of senior players would like to see the @entity36 given the reins if @entity4 goes			1
