by @entity0 published : 07:06 est , 24 june 2013 updated : 01:56 est , 25 june 2013 an interactive tour which invites people to ' get inside the mind ' of a dementia sufferer by using special glasses and gloves has launched in the @entity8			1
the @entity9 alters senses and perception to simulate the day - to - day experiences of people with neurological disorders like @entity15 ’s			1
users are given glasses which only allow tunnel vision and insoles which cause pins and needles			1
it also uses headphones which play constant background noise and gloves which hinder sense of touch			1
a new tool which allows users to get inside the mind of a dementia sufferer has been launched in the @entity8			1
@entity33 managing director , @entity32 , 41 , wearing some of the visual impairment devices used in the @entity9 confusion : list of instructions and basic tasks participants have to read in the darkened tour room , whilst wearing the visual impairment glasses perspective : users must follow the garbled instructions above and complete basic tasks like half fill and drink a glass of water , hindered by the glasses , gloves and headphones			1
it gives the user a unique insight into the difficulties faced by dementia sufferers they are then asked to complete five simple tasks - read the instructions on the wall , pair socks , pour a glass of water , tie a tie and write a note			1
its inventors hope the resource will help care professionals increase their understanding of dementia and improve care			1
creators say the eight - minute - long disorientating experience will help carers and nurses understand how people with dementia or @entity15 see the world			1
the specialist equipment has been tested by patients with stage one dementia to ensure it accurately recreates how they feel during an episode of the condition			1
trial : even a simple task like sorting and folding clothes becomes an ordeal because of the crippling effects of dementia sorting this pile of clothes into piles of socks , ties and other garments becomes a disorientating and perhaps upsetting ordeal when hindered by the dementia - simulating equipment the training company , @entity102 , which brought the course to the @entity8 , called on the government to make it mandatory for health professionals			1
specialist dementia nurse @entity107 , from @entity8 , also welcomed the training course			1
she said : ' the idea that carers would be able to empathise with a person with dementia using this new technology is really interesting			1
' it ’s so important for anyone delivering care to try and appreciate what it might be like for somebody who is living with dementia			1
it also uses headphones which play constant background noise and gloves which hinder sense of touch			1
the tour alters senses and perception to simulate the day - to - day experiences of people with neurological disorders like @entity15 's @entity9 participant @entity134 being briefed by @entity32 , 41			1
creators say the eight - minute - long disorientating experience will help carers and nurses understand how people with dementia or @entity15 see the world ' the arts and media have tried for a number of years to describe the experiences that people with dementia may have had and this technology could be another useful adjunct to that			1
' i would add that it ’s imperative that it ’s handled sensitively though , as there are many people who are living positively with dementia			1
' @entity32 , 41 , managing director of @entity158 which owns the @entity8 licence of the product , called on @entity161 to give the trial government funding			0
my experience of having dementia for eight minutes felt like how i imagine being subjected to torture would - isolating , debilitating and extremely distressing			1
first i was kitted out in all the gear ; gloves to stunt my touch , rough textured pads for my shoes to make my feet prickle , orange - dark glasses to impair my vision and headphones			1
my senses were heightened and i could n’t hear myself think because of the constant noise which was played in my ears			1
the most striking thing to me was the sounds of moving traffic which made me jumpy and the sirens which frightened me			0
i could hear a dripping tap , footsteps and a constant muffle made me unable to concentrate on anything			1
when i finally stumbled upon the list of instructions for the five tasks - after the initial instruction to find the list was reinforced to me - i found i was unable to read them			2
the words blurred and the letters danced on the page			0
i just wanted to know what to do and found it desperately frustrating			0
the normal processes i would go through on a day to day basis for some reason went out of the window			0
my healthy brain could n’t instruct my body to carry out simple and obvious tasks			1
as a healthy , logical adult i would have turned the light on in the room before the trial started to make it easier , but that did n’t even occur to me			0
i found myself attempting to pair socks sat in and among a pile of clothes on the floor because my feet prickled and i could n’t see			0
baffling as it may seem , at the time it made more sense to me to throw all the clothes on floor to search for pairs of socks			0
when asked to clear the table again i popped things on the floor as it seemed logical			0
i was later told that healthy adults would never dump clothes on the floor			0
i struggled to make sense of any @entity228 found myself wandering around in the dark , finding things to look at and finding a safe place to sit			0
i genuinely felt like my grip on reality and normality had gone completely			0
it deeply upset me that they could switch my brain off that quickly			0
i walked into the room knowing nothing about dementia and now i feel i have been given a @entity241 look to help me understand the daily struggle people face			2
i have seen in just a few minutes how this disorder takes away your coherent mind and in all honesty it was disturbing			0
i think if everyone could try the experience it would really challenge their views of the illness and how to care for it			0
he said : ' @entity161 keeps saying that we need to improve understanding and care provision for people with dementia			2
' we want the prime minister to let us come to number 10 and put him through the tour			0
' he added : ' the tour gives you a window into the world of those suffering with dementia			2
' it truly is an unusual , emotional and very thought - provoking experience			0
' it ’s impossible to know exactly what it feels like to have dementia , but the tour brings people closer to what it is like than any other system in existence			2
' we want to get this technology out to as many organisations and health professionals as possible			0
' we want to see the service provided to all those working in care homes with elderly people suffering from the illness to experience to allow them to understand how it feels			0
' the only way to do this is to put the healthy brain in the challenging situation of the dementia brain and see for yourself			2
' in the @entity8 if you have cancer everyone understands it , people jump in to support you , help you through it and help you fight it			0
' family members can get their heads around what is happening			0
' but dementia is n’t like that , people struggle to cope because they struggle to understand it and sufferers end up closed away on their own , when in reality they need to maintain interaction and instruction			2
' through the trials we have learnt things like the importance of the application of touch - placing a hand on a sufferers arm to show contact will mean they engage with the instructions better			2
' conservative mp @entity322 , who represents @entity323 , @entity324 , said : ' i was hugely impressed by the work of @entity327 in bringing the @entity9 to the @entity8			1
' it is an incredibly powerful window into the world of a dementia patient , and will be invaluable in giving carers , family and friends of patients the empathy they need to understand the condition			1
' i thoroughly recommend @entity339 ’s tour and applaud the work that @entity327 are doing			0
' the virtual dementia tour was designed by @entity339 , 60 , who has been working with dementia patients since 1983 and began researching the tour in 2000			2
the @entity345 based inventor said : ' it is really up to us			0
as our society grows we need to grow and mature with dementia , and that means we are the ones that have to change			2
' the thing about dementia is it is not something that just strikes a person , it strikes a family , the people who care for the family and their children , it affects everyone			2
' you ca n’t be more aware of dementia than actually being given dementia for asmall period of time			2
' according to the @entity368 , there are an estimated 820,000 people in the @entity8 with dementia and only 44 per cent of people with dementia in @entity373 , @entity374 and @entity375 receive a diagnosis			0
while dementia mainly affects older people , there are an estimated 15,000 people in the @entity8 under the age of 65 who have dementia			0
former prime minister @entity384 , 40th @entity386 @entity385 and best selling author @entity387 all suffered from dementia .			0

@entity9 alters senses and perception to simulate condition
glasses only allow tunnel vision and shoe insoles cause pins and needles
headphones play constant background noise and gloves hinder touch
even simple tasks are rendered bewildering by dementia simulation
