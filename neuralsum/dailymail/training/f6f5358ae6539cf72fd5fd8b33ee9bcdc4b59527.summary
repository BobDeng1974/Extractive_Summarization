one week into the @entity1 season and @entity2 is already beginning to sound a little like his predecessor			0
‘ i ’m not hired to be fired , ’ said the @entity5 manager			1
‘ i ’m hired to build up a team			1
it ’s a process and that process needs time			0
‘ i think the fans of @entity10 are intelligent			2
i ’ve already said that the first three months will be difficult for the players , especially , and the fans			2
i ’ve said it also to ( executive vice-chairman ) @entity14 and the @entity16 family that it is always like that — this is not an overnight job			0
@entity21 , then , should be careful about looking too far into the future			1
nevertheless , the @entity45 ’s lament was easy to understand			1
these are extraordinary times at @entity41 as the club ’s first continental manager endeavours to impose a new playing style on a squad that looks short of quality and is already ravaged by injury			0
@entity5 lost to @entity33 at home on the opening day and on sunday they travel to @entity55 at the end of a week that has told us a lot			1
@entity60 and @entity61 have won away and look primed and ready , with strength in depth waiting on the bench			0
making his point : @entity67 will lead the line for @entity5 when they travel to @entity55 on sunday blow : @entity5 were beaten in their first match of the @entity1 season			1
@entity33 won 2 - 1 at @entity41 @entity5 , meanwhile , are trying to plug holes , with @entity14 looking for salvation in the last week of the transfer window and @entity21 seeking understanding from his new audience			1
this week former @entity5 midfielder @entity77 claimed he was ‘ scared ’ of the future he envisaged for the club			1
‘ @entity77 has to believe in the philosophy , ’ said @entity21			1
‘ i can imagine that the fans are also scared because they have seen the last year and now they have seen the first home match			1
but they have to believe			0
two weeks ago i was the king of @entity10 and now i ’m the devil of @entity10			0
‘ it ’s the football world — especially the media			0
the club have hired me for my philosophy , not because i ’m a nice person			2
i am a nice person but it is my philosophy they hired			2
‘ for example , i have to drive on the left over here and i have to pay a lot of attention to drive properly			2
it costs me a lot of energy			2
it ’s the same for the players			0
i bring another philosophy into the club and that ’s difficult for them because i have to give a lot of information			2
i ’m only saying what is my experience			0
heading for the exit : @entity108 has been told he can leave @entity5 during the transfer window ‘ clubs like @entity111 and @entity112 are a good reference point			1
that ’s what i am saying , it will take three months			0
but it could be one month , or it could be four months			0
but it is not a question of being champion at the end of the season , because we have to build up a team , and that process takes maybe longer			1
‘ at my other clubs , we did it in the first year , so what can i say ? we have to wait and see , and believe in it			0
but when i have to say it five times , it is not a good signal			0
’ @entity5 ’s new signing @entity26 sat alongside @entity21 at his press conference on friday			1
the fact the central defender does not yet have a work permit to enable him to play perhaps sums up the start @entity5 have made to the new season			1
@entity26 may have to wait until tuesday in the @entity138 at @entity139 , a game where @entity108 may also figure after apparently being told by the manager that he can leave the club			0
@entity21 would n’t confirm that he was looking to sell the @entity144 striker but nor did he deny it			1
it is , however , hard to imagine @entity5 selling a talented 23 - year - old in whom they have invested so much without buying a replacement first			1
‘ i know what i have said to @entity108 and @entity108 knows exactly what i have said to him , ’ said @entity21			2
‘ i do n’t speak about it , it ’s private			0
i assume @entity108 is not talking about our conversation and that ’s the way it should be			0

@entity5 boss urges supporters to keep faith in his philosophy
@entity21 says that he has been *appointed* to build a team *...* not to be fired
