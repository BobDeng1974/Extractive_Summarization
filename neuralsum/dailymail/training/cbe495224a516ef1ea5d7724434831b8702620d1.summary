by @entity0 a devoted husband whose wife has been convicted of trying to murder him said today : ' i still love her and always will '			1
@entity4 , 66 , used a cravat to throttle her disabled partner @entity6 , 56 , and only failed to kill him because a @entity8 's driver arrived to deliver their weekly shop			1
afterwards she told police she ' did n't have a gun and did n't like knives so strangling was all she could think of ' , @entity10 heard			2
heartbroken : @entity15 was strangled by his mentally - ill wife @entity4 at home but he says he will always love her and she should never be blamed for what happened to him happier time : mr and mrs @entity4 have been married for 28 years - pictured in 2010 - but her conviction for attempted murder , which he never supported , means that she will never be allowed home again but mr @entity15 said today his full - time carer wife was ' failed ' by the @entity24 who released her from a secure unit on two separate occasions despite her telling staff she wanted to ' suffocate him '			1
' they kept this from me and sent her home to care for me 24 hours a day			2
she was failed by them			2
there is no chance she should have come home , ' he told @entity39			2
mrs @entity4 has admitted attempted murder and yesterday was told at @entity10 she would be detained indefinitely in a mental hospital			1
the heartbroken couple , who are still ' devoted ' to each other , shared a hug afterwards before she was taken away to custody			0
they will never be allowed to be together without supervision			0
mr @entity15 said : ' she is a loving , caring person			1
she is as gentle as a lamb			0
‘ i still love her and always will			2
she has cared for me selflessly for many years and made huge sacrifices in her life			0
‘ she was badly let down by people who should have cared for her			0
i believe that none of this would ever have happened had she been kept in			0
‘ we speak on the phone four to five times a day and i see her around four times a week			0
‘ it is sad because she will never be allowed to come home again and we will never be able to spend time together without supervision ’			0
attempted murder : @entity4 , left , was interrupted while trying to murder her husband @entity6 , right , both outside court , by the arrival of a shopping delivery			1
mr @entity15 says she should n't have been prosecuted saved : mrs @entity4 was in the process of trying to kill her husband when their shopping from @entity8 's arrived ( file picture )			1
afterwards she carried on as if nothing had happened , her husband said mr @entity15 , who suffers from muscular dystrophy and is wheelchair bound , was left with blood spotting behind his eyes and marks to his neck as a result of her attack on may 26 last year			1
the attack only stopped when a @entity8 's shopping delivery arrived and interrupted them			0
but he says she should never have been prosecuted for trying to kill him			0
' i was sitting in my wheelchair when @entity4 came up from behind me and put the cravat round my neck , ' mr @entity15 said			1
bereft : mr @entity15 has described how his wife @entity4 came from behind and throttled him with his cravat having repeatedly told professionals she wanted to harm him ‘ it went on for at least ten minutes or more			1
she did not say anything at all during it			0
when i could i asked her to stop			0
‘ it was a terrible situation to be in			0
i did not want my life to end			0
but i was also scared for @entity4 because if she managed to kill me i thought one day she would realise what she had done and try to harm herself			1
‘ then the food delivery arrived and she stopped , shut the door and took in the food			0
he knew nothing about it at all			0
she came back and it was as if nothing had happened ’			0
shortly after taking him to the toilet she called the police			0
she told them : ‘ i have tried to kill my husband and i am a horrible person ’			2
mr @entity15 blames the @entity24 for what happened , claiming the people who cared for her in a @entity109 knew she wanted to hurt him and failed to tell him each time she was released			1
he also says that social services failed to offer him enough care , meaning his unwell wife was expected to look after him round the clock despite having severe mental health problems			2
mrs @entity4 has bipolar and ' psychotic episodes ' meaning she can have hallucinations			1
wedding day : @entity6 and @entity4 met in 1984 and then married in september 1985			2
but as his health deteriorated his pharmacist wife was forced to give up work and care for him full time troubled : mrs @entity4 had suffered from mental health problems from her early twenties but ' psychotic ' episodes she suffered became worse in recent years , leading to her being taken into hospital on several occasions ( pictured in 2004 ) the couple , who are devout @entity129 , have been married for 28 years and met through church in @entity131			1
- @entity15 , whose wife @entity4 tried to kill him mr @entity15 says the authorities maintained she was not a risk because she had not made any ' direct threat to kill ' , he claims			1
mr @entity15 said days before she strangled him : ‘ she wrapped a pipe round my neck for three seconds and told me : " you realise how bad i am " but then she stopped '			1
the attempted murder has been linked to ' carer 's fatigue ' , where a person snaps through the pressures of looking after a loved one			2
@entity4 's husband says she was put under incredible pressure to look after him			2
he said after she tried to kill him he was left to look after himself from 1pm to 10pm each day , and social workers would leave glasses of water around the house with long straws in them so he could stay hydrated			0
mr @entity15 then spent three months in hospital after failing to care for himself			1
it was only in november 2012 when he was given a 24 - hour help at home			2

' @entity181 , head of adult care with @entity183 , said : ' we will not go into detail about individual cases but can confirm we have not received any complaints from mr @entity15 about the care package he receives			1
we will be contacting him to find out the details of his complaint and how he wishes to resolve matters			0
we take all complaints very seriously '			0
mr @entity15 has said he he hopes to launch legal action against both authorities and the county council because he blames them for what has happened to his wife			1
