by @entity0 for the @entity1 suddenly @entity3 ’s world does n’t seem so bad			1
six days after losing the ride on @entity7 favourite @entity6 at the request of trainer @entity9 , the @entity4 sat in the @entity10 as the 2013 winner could finish fourth to @entity12 in the @entity13 and her odds of landing a back - to - back @entity7 drifted to 10 - 1 with @entity17			1
quite what facial impression @entity3 wore as events unfold can only be guessed at but it ca n’t have been as grim as that of his replacement @entity23			2
@entity3 raced @entity24 to victory during race at @entity27 the @entity4 won the @entity28 at @entity27 after bouncing back from his ride with @entity6 @entity3 chats with @entity30 at @entity27 in @entity31 , @entity32 adding to the bounce in the @entity3 step was not only a win in the @entity36 on @entity38 ’s @entity37 but also that he still looks to have decent chance of an @entity7 ride , either with his group two @entity28 winner @entity24 or @entity42 , impressive winner of the @entity44			1
for the latter to happen @entity42 ’s jockey @entity45 will have to choose to partner his unbeaten @entity48 winner @entity47 but the bookmaker ’s verdict indicate it will be a tough choice			2
@entity51 have @entity42 , who was a 16 - 1 shot going into the @entity44 and had n’t run since april in an injury - disrupted season , sharing @entity7 favouritism at 5 - 1 with @entity55			0
@entity3 ’s boss @entity56 is only joint owner of @entity42 and @entity24 and can not dictate jockey plans but there is bound to be pressure behind the scenes to get his no 1 jockey a ride			1
after partnering @entity24 to a length and a half win from @entity65 , the @entity68 - trained colt ’s first success since last year ’s @entity69 , @entity3 said : ‘ @entity68 gave me a bundle of confidence			1
i hope he might be my @entity7 ride but it is out of my hands			1
i have to see what everyone else does			0
the jockey whispers into the ear of @entity30 at @entity27 ‘ @entity6 was exactly like @entity78			2
last year i was having a job holding her , she was that good			0
today she was not moving the same and you have seen the result			0
’ @entity6 , racing for the first time since @entity78 , seems to have lost her zip and has lost all three runs this season			0
@entity9 , however , insisted : ‘ she needed that run - do n’t rule her out			0
’ with @entity90 @entity69 winner @entity88 ruled out of the @entity7 over the weekend , the latest trials also strengthened the position of @entity92 and @entity48 winner @entity93			0
she is 5 - 1 and committed to the race after being season was put forward as a reason for her @entity97 defeat last month			0
saturday ’s @entity100 winner @entity98 is 10 - 1 for the @entity7			2
his trainer @entity101 and jockey @entity103 also won yesterday ’s @entity13 @entity104 at the @entity105 with @entity106 .			1

the @entity4 jockey bounced back from ride on @entity7 favourite @entity6
trainer @entity112 *boosted* @entity3 *'s* confidence
@entity3 won @entity36 on @entity38 ’s @entity37
