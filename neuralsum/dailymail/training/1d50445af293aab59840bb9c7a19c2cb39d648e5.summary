after contracting an infection in hospital , the sepsis set in , shutting down the organs in her body			1

this warning has been echoed by healthcare professionals for years , with little community awareness			0
' sepsis kills more people than @entity94 , prostate cancer , and breast cancer combined , ' said mr. @entity3			2
' i got on the internet and did some research and found that there were no support groups in @entity49 for those suffering from sepsis , or those who had friends or family suffering from the condition , ' ' there was no support here for people like myself to understand what sepsis is , ' ' there was a leukemia foundation and and i was able to talk to people about leukaemia , and most importantly , get support , but there was no one for me to talk to about sepsis , ' there were groups in the @entity119 and the @entity81 , so i thought i would do something about it to raise awareness of sepsis in the community , ' ' @entity4 probably contracted the infection whilst in hospital , ' said mr @entity3			1

' many of these symptoms , such as fever and difficulty breathing , mimic other conditions , making sepsis hard to diagnose in its early stages , ' ' people are often told they have pneumonia or an infected gall bladder where the real issue is that they have sepsis , which is often contracted during or after surgery			0
' professor @entity51 and the @entity49 @entity150 are passionate about increasing healthcare standards to avoid further cases such as @entity4 's			1
