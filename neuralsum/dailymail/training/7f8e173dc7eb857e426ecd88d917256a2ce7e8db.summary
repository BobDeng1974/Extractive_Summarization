not only was i running a week late on a very important deadline , but i ’d lied about how well the project was going			2
i ’d made a stupid and very embarrassing mistake and was desperately trying to cover it up			2
in the end my only option was to come clean and go grovelling to the top for forgiveness			2
luckily for my career ’s sake , what followed was not the verbal battering , formal warning and possible p45 i ’d have got from a man — it was a gentle dressing - down and sympathetic enquiry as to whether i was all right			0
she also said these things happen			0
in short , i got away with it			0
but was it because my boss , as a woman , was naturally more empathic and fair - minded ? or was it because she looked at me doing my best puppy - dog eyes and could n’t resist my charms ? according to a study published last week , women make better bosses than men thanks to their ‘ cooperation , collaboration and consensus - building in order to make decisions ’			1
i could n’t agree more			0
as a magazine journalist , i ’ve worked for strong , powerful women for most of my career , and they ’ve made far better bosses than the men			1
the more women at the top , the better , i say			1
but not because of their co-operation , collaboration , etc. it ’s because i can flirt with them and get away with far more than i ever could under a man			1
have the firms i ’ve worked for benefited from the female touch ? who cares ? i ’m not a board member , i ’m just paid to do my job			1
and that job has often been made far easier thanks to the fact i ’m working for women who can not help but be seduced by my cheeky - chappy charms			1
it should be said that i ’m not the best - looking man in the world			0
but i ’ve been known to turn on the charm			1
and no matter how powerful or brilliant my woman bosses have been ( and most have been brilliant ) , being a man has almost always helped me get on with them			1
there was the boss who saw herself as a mother figure to me , treating any professional failings on my part as something we could overcome together , and cutting me far more slack than any of my women colleagues			1
there was another who regularly asked me for advice on her love life then gave me the better jobs to do as a thank - you			0
i ’ve been extravagantly flirted with by another two bosses — one who , like me , is married , and said she enjoyed it because she knew neither of us would really want anything to come of it			1
about ten years ago , another female boss had a crush on me			1
even though i ’d no intention of taking her for a drink , i kept up the pretence that i might			0
cheeky chappy charm : @entity0 said he can get away with more with a female boss ( posed by models ) according to the study , male bosses tend to follow ‘ rules , regulations and traditional ways of doing business ’			1
for me , that ’s meant male editors have refused to take any nonsense , been unforgiving of failure — and happy to punish slackness , sloppiness or even honest mistakes with a good old - fashioned bawling out			1
that way everyone knows who ’s @entity115			0
it ’s not pleasant to be on the receiving end but there ’s no disputing it works			0
the women editors have , as the study says , ruled through cooperation			1
they ’ve opted to motivate staff through example and inspiration rather than fear and intimidation			0
the end product has n’t necessarily been better — but it ’s made my life a whole lot easier			2
although they have , for the most part , been excellent at their jobs , they ’ve not been immune to the charms of a straight man in offices mostly filled with women			2
noticing that your boss has had her hair done sounds too obvious a way to wriggle out of an uncomfortable situation			0
but shallow tactics have helped me often			0
i ’ve also got away with more office hangovers than i should — they ’re seen as somehow more acceptable for a man — and a cheeky wink has usually got me excused for late arrivals , too			2
would i attempt any of those things with a male boss ? good @entity153 , no ! tell the average @entity115 male editor you love his new haircut , and he ’ll more than likely swing for you			0
the magazine writer has never faced the wrath of a female boss - he believes they are harder on women ( posed by models ) even the fiercest women are softer on men			1
in the @entity166 i worked under a particularly fearsome female — she ’d made her reputation as a girl who could outperform guys , and was determined to show she would n’t give anyone an easy ride just because of her chromosomes			1
her skirts were tiny , her shoulder pads huge , her language robust , and she strode around daring anyone to deliver anything less than perfection			0
unless , that is , you were a man			0
i quickly found out that she reserved her greatest fury and harshest standards for the girls			2
in her view , young women starting out in their careers had to be shown that nothing would come easy — because they were women			2
she ’d had to fight her way to the top and so would they			0
it ’s the same for my friends			0
we ’d never admit to getting on in our careers just because of a willingness to exploit our sexuality , but those of us who have worked under female bosses have n’t been able to resist at least trying it			1
so give me a strong , powerful woman in charge any day			0
especially if i ’m one of the few men in the office with her and she ’s got a soft spot for talented but occasionally lazy journalists with a tendency to put an inappropriate ‘ xx ’ on the end of work emails .			2
