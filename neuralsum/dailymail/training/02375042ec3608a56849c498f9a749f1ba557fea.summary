by @entity0 published : 14:34 est , 10 february 2014 @entity2 : 16:41 est , 10 february 2014 the @entity3 at @entity4 appear to being falling somewhat flat , as hardly any spectators turn up and senior officials complain the games have no buzz			1
photographs of @entity11 venues show that entire banks of seats are practically deserted , while the one or two fans who did struggle out to see the world - class sporting events wrap up against the cold			1
embarrassingly , an @entity18 member of a top @entity11 committee said that many of the @entity22 spectators were seeing the sports for the first time ever , and behaved without enthusiasm - except when @entity22 athletes took centre stage			1
room for improvement : the majority of seats at the @entity32 were empty yesterday all by myself : a woman checks her phone before the start of a speed - skating event held yesterday @entity39 wave , anybody ? senior @entity11 figures have spoken out about the lack of atmosphere , as seen here in the sparse crowd at a speed skating event @entity47 , a @entity18 member who sits on the policy - making executive board , said : ' here , people are more reserved			1
' there 's not a lot of rah - rah , except for the @entity22 athletes who get a great reception			1
' i think as time goes on and they get used to it , there will be more excitement			2
a lot of people have not seen these sports before			1
' @entity64 , a @entity65 who helped organise the acclaimed 1994 winter games in @entity67 , called on @entity4 's organisers to act over the empty stadiums			2
lack of enthusiasm ? one senior @entity11 organiser claimed that many spectators had never seen the sports before sparse : at least this spectator for a downhill skiing race had somewhere to put his bag @entity78 effort : these @entity22 fans cheer and whoop at the men 's biathlon , despite rows of emptiness behind them it 's easy to assume that cold temperatures could be keeping spectators away - but in fact , the @entity4 are starting to feel more like the @entity90			1
on monday , temperatures soared to @entity92 ( @entity93 ) , forcing skiers to put snow in their racing suits to cool down			2
the mountain venues are expected to return to freezing tuesday , organizers said			0
but from wednesday , warmer weather is in the forecast			0
organizers said the temperature could reach @entity102 ( @entity93 ) on thursday			0
at the @entity103 , organizers canceled the first of three jumps after sunny skies softened the snow in the landing area			0
to combat the possibility of high temperatures , organizers have been storing large amounts of snow and say they have enough to continue			0
according to mr @entity64 , despite the large volume of empty seats , it was still proving impossible to buy tickets for the clearly under - subscribed events			1
he said : ' there are not enough people			0
' they have to see to it they fill the stadiums			0
' i understand that all tickets have been sold and people who want to buy tickets they can not buy tickets , so they should do something about this to get school children , or students or even military people without uniforms out watching			0
' some events , like figure skating , have been packed			2
others , like biathlon , have been half - empty			0
the men 's downhill - considered the marquee event of the @entity141 ski schedule - failed to draw a full house sunday , with a turnout of about 6,000 fans at the 7,500 - capacity venue			0
@entity146 has little tradition in @entity22 and the games have n't pulled in the cowbell - ringing crowds familiar in @entity150			1
however , some events , such as figure skating , have had almost entirely @entity22 crowds			1
the speedskating venue was also noted for its boisterousness when the @entity22 or @entity156 were racing			1
embarrassing : @entity4 organisers have said they will start calling on volunteers to fill up empty venues bleak : previous @entity3 have also had problems with empty stadia the 2012 summer olympics in @entity163 were also plagued by a lack of spectators for the early events , which many complained was down to an excess of corporate seats which were not used			1
@entity4 organizers said today that they have started calling on volunteers to fill seats at less popular events			2
spokeswoman @entity174 said some volunteers enrolled in a motivation program are offered tickets to see competition after hours			0
' it depends on the events , ' she said			2
' if we see that there is not a turnout and there are seats available , then , yes , we invite some of the volunteers to join in			0

photographs reveal sparse crowds at many events
senior @entity11 figures have complained about the lack of buzz
though @entity22 athletes are said to always get a good reception
