a council has been slammed for ripping up more than 12,000 cobbles from a historic road so it can relay them to make it a smoother surface for cyclists			0
cobbles on the road , which runs alongside the @entity9 and dates back to the 19th century , will be lifted from their current place and cut in half before being relaid again			1
the council tested the technique on a small patch of paving and said the reaction had been ' overwhelmingly ' in support for the scheme from cyclists , pedestrians and wheelchair users			1
the cobbles will be lifted from their current place , cut in half and then relaid again to make the surface smoother for cyclists the history of the area dates back to may 1809 when 83 acres of the tidal @entity26 was impounded to keep ships in the port of @entity29 afloat at all times			1
@entity31 , a member of the @entity32 , has questioned what the work will do to the appearance of the historic harbourside			2
she said : ' 12,000 cobbles have been lifted			2
they are being cut in half and re-laid so that there is a flat surface			2
the history of the area dates back to the 19th century when @entity29 @entity43 was built ' it has apparently been requested by the cyclists despite the fact that it is a harbourside walk and not a designated cyclist route			1
' this is a massive job , must have cost a fortune since the cobbles are hard to cut and will totally change the appearance of the area			1
' the work is part of the council 's and the @entity57 's overall vision of making the city more attractive for users			0
ms @entity31 added that the area is @entity61 listed , and she did not believe the council had obtained the proper permission before starting the work			0
she said : ' they have not applied for listed building consent , so there has been no consultation			0
' a spokesperson for @entity69 said : ' the changes do not require planning consent or other permissions			0
' before starting the work , we tested a small area of cobbles behind the @entity77 and received overwhelming support from people in favour of the technique			1
the spokesperson added that the work was being carried out to improve the surface of the road for pedestrians and wheelchair users as well as cyclists			0
she said : ' we are making some adjustments to the cobbles in these streets to improve the surface for pedestrians , cyclists , wheelchair users , people suffering from arthritis and many others			0
' the work is part of the @entity57 and the council 's vision to improve road surfaces across the city in order to make @entity29 more attractive to walk and cycle in			0
' the council tested the technique on a small patch and said the reaction had been ' overwhelmingly ' in support			1
