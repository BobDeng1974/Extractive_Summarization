@entity32 and professor @entity33 of @entity26 ’s @entity34 carried out a review of 42 studies that looked at 1,843 participants in 14 countries , including a total of 74,000 hours of group walking			0
@entity32 said ‘ our research suggests that by joining a group , people walk faster and further than they would normally walk			0
‘ it is one of the best and easiest ways to boost overall health			0
the benefits are wide ranging – and they go above and beyond making people more physically active			0
’ she said the psychological benefits and security found in group walking paid health dividends			1
‘ the merits of walking – including lowering the recurrence of some cancers – are well known , but these findings show that the dynamics and social cohesion of walking in groups may produce additional advantages			1
‘ people who walk in groups also tend to have a more positive attitude toward physical activity , a shared experience of wellness , and say they feel less lonely and isolated ’ she added			2

britons are advised to do 150 minutes a week of moderate activity such as gardening , dancing or brisk walking but almost a third do less than 30 minutes exercise a week , and one in 10 does n't manage to walk more than five minutes at a time over a month			2
the new study , published in the @entity80 ( must credit ) , looked at walkers with obesity , heart disease , type 2 diabetes , fibromyalgia , parkinson ’s disease , as well as healthy participants the findings showed people who joined walking groups registered statistically significant falls in average blood pressure , resting heart rate , body fat , weight , and total cholesterol			1
walkers also experienced improvements in lung power , overall physical functioning , and general fitness , and they were less depressed than before they started walking regularly			2
evidence was less clear - cut for reductions in other risk factors for ill health , such as waist circumference , fasting blood glucose and blood fats			0
three - quarters of all participants stuck with the group , and there were few side effects , apart from a handful of falls on roots or wet ground , and minor injuries such as calf strain			0
@entity32 said people in groups get a sense of belonging , with some men and women enjoying the security			1
she said ‘ people told us all the organising was done for them , they simply had to turn up			0
it becomes an obligation , habit - forming , which helps them stick at it			0
‘ some men said if they go for a walk in the woods on their own with no dog their motives might be questioned			0
’ she said ‘ these findings may provide clinicians with evidence of a further effective option to recommend to those patients who would benefit from increasing the amount of moderate - intensity physical activity they do			2
’ the ‘ @entity149 ’ scheme , run by the @entity147 and @entity148 , is @entity151 ’s largest network of outdoor group walks , with 70,000 regular walkers , 10,000 volunteer walk leaders and approximately 3,000 short walks offered every week around the country			2
@entity157 , programme manager for @entity149 , said ‘ walking really works			0
every day we see the positive impact this simple activity has on the thousands of people who regularly take part in @entity165 group walks			0
‘ we ’re delighted to see further evidence to support what we see on the ground – that walking with others adds to the many health and well - being benefits regular walkers see			1
“ as the evidence mounts , we ’d like to see more local authorities , clinicians and public health professionals supporting and recommending walking groups in their local areas			1
