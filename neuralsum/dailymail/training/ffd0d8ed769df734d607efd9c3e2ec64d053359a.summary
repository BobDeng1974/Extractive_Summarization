by @entity0 the @entity3 could have been prevented by a single document ... but @entity5 destroyed it before it was made public , @entity2 secret files have revealed			2
the last will and testament of baron @entity7 , @entity8 's president until his death in 1934 , rejected @entity5 's claim to the @entity11 and urged the nation to embrace democracy			1
such was the respect that @entity8 's political class had for @entity7 , his dissent from beyond the grave would surely have been heard and may well have obstructed @entity5 's rise to power , prevented war and changed the course of history , reported @entity22			1
mistrust : the last will and testament of baron @entity7 ( left ) , @entity8 's president until his death in 1934 , rejected @entity5 's claim to the @entity11 and urged the nation to embrace democracy			1
but @entity5 caught wind of the document and demanded it be brought to him before it was released			2
it was never seen again			0
the claims , part of a haul of secret @entity2 documents declassified last month , were made by baron @entity35 , an aristocratic diplomat and confident of @entity7 who helped draft the will			2
the confidant : the claims , part of a haul of secret @entity2 documents declassified last month , were made by baron @entity35 , an aristocratic diplomat and confidant of @entity7 who helped draft the will @entity40 claimed @entity7 's will was a powerful attack on @entity5 's ambition , declaring that the the army should be independent from parliament , that a constitutional monarchy should be established and that the legislative and executive branches of government should be separated			1
' he said further that he wanted the rights of parliament established under a two - tier system on democratic lines , like that of @entity55 , and that he wanted all racial and religious discrimination abolished , ' @entity40 told the @entity22 in 1947			2
@entity5 and @entity7 hated each other			1
@entity7 described his chancellor as that ' bohemian corporal ' , intentionally confusing @entity5 's birthplace of @entity62 in @entity63 , with @entity62 in @entity64			1
despite @entity5 's repeated demands to be appointed as chancellor , @entity7 repeatedly refused until finally being forced by the deteriorating political stability of the @entity68 to grant the @entity70 leader his wish			1
his health failing , he issued a decree which suspended various civil liberties before signing the @entity75 , giving @entity5 's administration legislative powers			1
he died the following year , after which @entity5 declared the office of president vacant and , as ' @entity81 ' , made himself head of state			2
best of enemies : @entity7 ( left ) described his chancellor as that ' bohemian corporal ' , intentionally confusing @entity5 's birthplace of @entity62 in @entity63 , with @entity62 in @entity64 but instead of sacking @entity5 and declaring martial law , @entity7 drew up a will - a ' bomb timed to go off posthumously and blow @entity5 off course ' , wrote historian @entity88 in @entity22			1
before becoming @entity8 's president in 1925 , baron @entity7 was a highly - decorated @entity90 - @entity8 field marshal			2
he first came under the national spotlight when , at the age of 66 , he won the decisive @entity93 , almost completely destroying the @entity94 in august 1914			0
becoming chief of the general staff in 1916 , he quickly rose in the @entity8 public 's esteem ultimately gaining more influence in @entity8 than the @entity99 himself			2
retiring in 1919 , he returned to public life in 1925 , surfing his wave of popularity to become president			0
but the rise of the @entity70 made @entity5 impossible to ignore			0
@entity7 described his chancellor as that ' bohemian corporal ' , intentionally confusing @entity5 's birthplace of @entity62 in @entity63 , with @entity62 in @entity64			1
despite his repeated attempts to spurn @entity5 's advances on the office of @entity59 , the deteriorating political stability of the @entity68 coupled with the rise in popularity enjoyed by the @entity70 forced @entity7 to give in			1
he appointed @entity5 as @entity8 chancellor in january 1933			1
in february , he issued a decree which suspended various civil liberties before signing the @entity75 a month later , giving @entity5 legislative powers			0
he died the following year , after which @entity5 declared the office of president vacant and , as ' @entity81 ' , made himself head of state			0
within hours of @entity7 's death on august 2 1934 , @entity5 announced the offices of @entity59 and president would merge under his rule as supreme @entity81			2
a vote was called to let the @entity8 people express their view of @entity5 's unprecedented move to become head of government and head of state			1
but as soon as he heard about the will , @entity5 reportedly ordered his henchmen ' to ensure that this document comes into my possession as soon as possible '			0
colonel @entity135 , son of the late president but a loyal @entity70 , duly handed it over			0
it was never seen again			0
instead , just before the vote , the @entity139 published @entity7 's ' political testament ' - a glowing endorsement of @entity5 and his political goals			1
many historians believe it was a forgery			0
four days later , 38 million voters supported @entity148 coup			0
five million people rejected it			0
the next day , the @entity139 made every member of the @entity8 army swear an obligatory oath of allegiance			0
baron @entity40 insisted : ' @entity5 would never have come into power , and there would have been no war , if the wishes of @entity7 had been known to the @entity8 people			1
' ' we tend to see history in terms of unstoppable forces , great movements of economics or ideology that dwarf individual choice and volition , ' wrote @entity88			0
' but small things also change history — the whistle - blower , the resister , the single , history - defining document			0
' while @entity5 must have destroyed the document he was given , two drafts survived			2
@entity70 agents tracked the first down to a bank account in @entity179 and destroyed it			0
the other was kept by @entity40			0
but just before @entity40 , a staunch opponent of @entity181 , defected to @entity55 to spend the rest of the war in an internment camp , he said he burned his copy - the last written testament to @entity7 's true feelings about @entity5 and the future of @entity8 .			1

@entity7 rejected @entity5 's claim to power , pushing for democracy
he *recorded* feelings in will , drafted by @entity40
but @entity5 demanded to see will before it was published and destroyed it
@entity7 hated @entity5 , despite making him @entity8 chancellor in 1933
it was intended as a ' bomb timed to go off posthumously ' and derail @entity5
