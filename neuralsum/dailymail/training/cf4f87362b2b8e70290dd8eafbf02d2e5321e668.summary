the court was told the father - of - two had taken illegal stimulant drugs before eight police arrived at his rented flat in @entity24 , @entity25 , following a report that he had damaged a bathroom and was in an agitated state			1

there was a risk to passers - by			0
’ he said after mr @entity2 threw a glass out of the window he began to approach @entity48 ‘ his eyes rolling to the back of his head and his fists clenched ’			1
‘ he was fearful he would be attacked and feared for his own safety , ’ said mr @entity36			0
‘ the officer stated that there was simply no time to issue a warning			0
‘ @entity59 lodged in the skin of @entity2 ’s torso , and he received five seconds of electrical charge			2
’ mr @entity2 fell back and knocked his head on his television cabinet , but the shock failed to stop his resistance so three seconds later the officer shocked him again			2
pepper spray was then used on mr @entity2 before the third shock , 23 seconds later , and then a fourth nine seconds later			1
yesterday ’s hearing at @entity71 heard mr @entity2 had taken the illegal stimulant drug @entity72 before the incident , which is similar to speed			1
' gentle giant with a drug habit ' : @entity82 ( right ) , mr @entity2 's former partner and mother of his two children , said he would take pills and inject anabolic steroids as part of his bodybuilding regime , a sport he started to become interested in when he was just 13 , his mother @entity78 ( left ) told the inquest distressing : at mr @entity2 's hearing the jury had to watch distressing @entity91 footage of a wild - eyed , semi-naked and agitated mr @entity2 , pictured with daughter honour , in the police van after his arrest for criminal damage after the shocks were administered , he was carried downstairs and into the police van , where @entity91 footage showed him naked and struggling			1
