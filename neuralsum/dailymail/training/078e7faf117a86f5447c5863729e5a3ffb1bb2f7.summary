by @entity0 @entity1 : 11:01 est , 11 december 2013 @entity2 : 18:08 est , 11 december 2013 new footage has been released by the @entity4 investigating the crash of an @entity7 @entity6 at @entity9 airport in july			1
video shows the plane as it hit the runway and flipped up into the air before somersaulting along the runway @entity15 , the captain of the plane has confessed to investigators he felt stressed out and was ' very concerned ' about attempting a manual visual approach because the runway 's automatic warning systems were out of service due to construction			1
@entity23 , a 46 - year - old pilot who was landing the big jet for his first time at @entity9 , stated ' it was very difficult to perform a visual approach with a heavy airplane			0
the jet 's tail strikes the ground , and the whole aircraft pitches up into the air deadly impact : three people were killed and more than 180 injured in the accident , on july 6			1
at a hearing about the crash today , the @entity4 released documents showing that the pilots knew their speed was too low as they approached the ground an aerial view of an @entity7 @entity6 plane is seen after it crashed while landing at @entity53 in @entity54 in july hearing : @entity4 ( @entity4 ) chair @entity55 , center , takes her seat next to @entity4 member @entity58 , right , during an @entity4 investigative hearing in @entity60 experts : retired capt. @entity62 , a former @entity6 chief pilot , center , looks over documents with other @entity6 personnel before the @entity4 investigative hearing on the crash landing of @entity33 the jet crash landed after approaching low and slow in an accident that left three dead and more than 150 injured			1
the report was released at the start of a daylong @entity4 hearing into the accident			1
' in this hearing , we will learn about the facts of the crash , but we will also learn about the factors that enabled so many to walk away			2
we will focus not only on the human machine interface in highly automated aircraft , but also on emergency response , ' said @entity4 chairman @entity55 , opening the hearing			2
the trainee captain told investigators that he realized others had been landing at @entity9 without the glide slope indicator , a technology that helps pilots land at the airport			1
that system was out of service while the runway was expanded , and has since been restarted			0
interviews with the pilots who were in the cockpit indicated a nervous trainee captain , while the other two pilots recognized too late they were coming in too low and slow			0
when asked if he was concerned about his ability to perform the visual approach , @entity23 said ' very concerned , yea			0
' the plane struck a seawall just short of the runway , shearing off its tail and sending the rest of the airliner sliding and turning down the runway before breaking apart and catching fire @entity109 contingent : @entity110 , chairman of the @entity111 , listens to testimony			2
the two - dozen witnesses at the hearing include representatives of @entity7 , @entity6 and the @entity116 and @entity109 representatives a former @entity6 foreign captain at @entity7 told investigators he found it ' extremely difficult ' to get pilots to fly visual approaches , and that they usually wanted to take off rather than land			1
in clear weather , it 's not unusual for pilots to make a visual approach , using the view through their windshield			0
experts carrying out the investigation into the @entity7 jet incident want to know how the three seasoned pilots allowed a passenger jet with no apparent mechanical problems in near - perfect weather conditions to lose speed so dramatically that it was on the brink of stalling moments before the crash			0
the pilot flying the plane was attempting to land without use of the autopilot			1
normally , the pilot in the second seat is supposed to have his eyes on the plane 's computer screens to monitor airspeed and other readings , rather than looking out the window			2
in this case , that pilot was a training captain who was grading the performance of the pilot flying the plane			1
the training captain told investigators he thought the plane 's autothrottle was maintaining engine power and thus speed , but discovered that was n't the case just moments before the crash			1
the autothrottle was ' armed , ' or made ready for activation , investigators said in briefings after the accident , but they left open the question whether it was engaged and in idle or another mode			0
aircraft systems can have many modes , or settings , and perform quite differently depending upon the mode			0
investigation : the wrecked @entity33 on the runway at @entity9 airport an @entity7 @entity6 is pictured after crashed landing in @entity9 , @entity54 , in july @entity180 assistant deputy chief @entity179 is also scheduled to talk at the hearing about how a fire truck racing toward the burning plane ran over a survivor on the tarmac			1
footage taken after the crash showed a fire truck running over 16 - year - old @entity189 while she was lying on the tarmac covered with fire - retardant foam			2
the @entity193 coroner later ruled that she was killed by the truck			0
attorneys representing some of the more than 60 crash victims suing the airline and @entity199 plan to attend the hearing			0
@entity7 is also offering $ 10,000 to each of the surviving passengers , a payout the airline says is not a settlement and does not prevent passengers from suing the airline			0
the hearing was originally scheduled to run for two days , starting tuesday , but it was postponed because of wintry weather in @entity60 the crash was the first commercial airline crash in the @entity210 since a crash near @entity212 , @entity213 , in 2009			2
safety experts believe pilots are becoming so reliant on computer systems in today 's airliners that on the rare occasions when something goes wrong they are unprepared to take control			0
