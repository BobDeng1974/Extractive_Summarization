by @entity1 reporter updated : 01:24 est , 21 june 2011 the @entity3 are preventing @entity4 from taking tougher action on immigration and stripping the workshy of benefits , the prime minister said			2
mr @entity4 firmly rejected claims that only @entity3 leader @entity10 was being forced to compromise in the coalition			1
' we 've all had to make compromises , ' he told @entity14 's @entity15 in the afternoon			1
prime minister @entity4 chats with @entity14 presenters @entity15 and @entity17 after his interview ' if i was running a @entity21 - only government i think we would be making further steps on things like immigration control or making sure that our welfare reforms were absolutely making sure that if you 're not prepared to work you ca n't go on welfare			2
' i think we 'd be tougher than that , ' he said			0
' we make compromises , we make agreements , but as a government i think we 're delivering a lot of good things for the country			0
' mr @entity4 conceded that the coalition ' has its problems ' but that it was generally working well			1
he denied that major policy issues were decided between himself and the deputy prime minister in their regular sunday evening telephone calls			0
' we often have a conversation on the phone on a sunday night to scope the issues that we need to settle , the problems that the government faces and some of the issues that are under discussion in the following week , but we also have very ordered meetings , as we did this morning , ' he said			1
' i think the coalition works well			1
we have n't had one for 65 years , it 's very different			1
mr @entity4 said @entity10 , left , was n't the only one who had made concessions while he admitted he ' admired ' some of mr @entity54 's work despite his mistakes ' but the idea of two parties coming together , burying some of their differences and acting in the national interest , for the national good , i think is working			1
it has it 's problems but ... ' mr @entity4 defended the government 's tough deficit - reduction package and attacked @entity67 's calls for a slowdown and tax cuts			1
' the programme of cuts is absolutely necessary to keep us out of the danger zone			0
my worry is that plan b as suggested by @entity67 , plan b stands for bankruptcy			1
' it stands for not living within your means , not paying down your debts			0
and eventually you can end up in a situation which we see on our television screens , like @entity85 , where people lose all confidence you 're going to be able to pay down your debts			0
' i would say the greatest stimulus we can give is to keep those interest rates low , so businesses can borrow money , so people can get on the housing ladder , so investment and the economy can grow			0
@entity4 hopes to improve his table tennis skills so that next time he plays @entity97 he can ' thrash ' him ' of course it 's choppy , it 's difficult			2
i know that households are suffering because inflation is high and petrol prices have gone up , and food prices are up , and people 's budgets are very tight			2
' but interest rates are low , the economy is growing and the last unemployment figures were pretty encouraging - the biggest monthly fall i think for 10 years			0
' the prime minister said he was going to practise his table tennis so he would be able to ' thrash ' @entity112 president @entity97 when they next meet			0
' i used to play table tennis a bit , i 'm going to have to restart so next time he comes i 'll thrash him , ' he said after being shown up by the president 's skills during a visit to a school			2
asked to choose his ideal dinner guests , dead or alive , mr @entity4 plumped for @entity123 , queen elizabeth i , to hear her first - hand account of dealing with the @entity126 , and celebrity cook @entity127 to prepare the spread because he is ' very greedy ' and loves food			0
forced to choose one style of food , he said it would be @entity133			0
he also said that he ' admired ' some of what @entity54 did in reforming public services but that the former @entity67 premier had made many mistakes .			1

the pm admits the coalition ' has its problems ' but works well
he defended the deficit reduction plan and attacked @entity67 's call to slow it down and cut taxes
