by @entity0 published : 12:10 est , 30 october 2012 updated : 19:13 est , 30 october 2012 a senior columnist at the @entity2 has openly questioned whether former @entity4 boss @entity3 is fit for his new post running @entity7 ’s most prestigious newspaper in the wake of the @entity10 sex abuse scandal			1
mr @entity3 has denied knowledge of a @entity4 cover - up and vowed to take up his role in @entity14 as planned next month			1
but in a column , @entity15 questioned his explanation of his role in the affair : ‘ @entity3 winds up appearing wilfully ignorant , and it makes you wonder what kind of an organisation the @entity4 was when he was running it			1
it also makes you wonder what kind of chief executive he ’d be at the @entity2			0
’ denial : @entity3 , left , has denied any knowledge of a @entity4 cover up over @entity10 , right , and vowed to take up his new job in @entity14 as planned on november 12 ‘ @entity3 winds up appearing willfully ignorant , and it makes you wonder what kind of an organization the @entity4 was when @entity3 was running it — and what kind of leader he was			1
it also makes you wonder what kind of chief executive he ’d be at @entity36 , ’ wrote mr @entity15			1
it comes as day after it was alleged that mr @entity3 's office was twice alerted to claims that @entity10 was a child abuser			1
in may and again in september , his aides were told of allegations that the late television presenter had molested youngsters on @entity4 premises			2
but on both occasions , a spokesman for the ex-director general insisted , the claims were not passed on to him			0
claims : @entity3 with a former colleague			2
mr @entity15 said @entity3 appears ' willfully ignorant ' mr @entity15 , a business and finance columnist writing for the flagship paper ’s op - ed page , said mr @entity3 ’s nameplate is already on his office door			1
‘ yet since early october , ’ he added , ‘ all anybody has asked about @entity3 are those two most damning of questions : what did he know , and when did he know it ? ’ mr @entity15 said the @entity4 ‘ plainly ’ did cover up @entity10 ’s wrongdoing			1
‘ what is far less certain is how high the cover - up went , ’ he continued			0
‘ @entity3 first said that he never heard the rumors about @entity10 , and that he did n’t learn about the “ @entity66 ” programme until after it was cancelled			2
given the byzantine nature of the @entity4 bureaucracy , these are plausible denials			2
@entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72			0
mr @entity15 said the @entity4 ‘ plainly ’ did cover up @entity10 ’s wrongdoing ‘ here is where it gets a little less plausible			1
@entity3 now says that at a cocktail party last december , a @entity4 reporter said to him , “ you must be worried about the ‘ @entity66 ’ investigation into @entity10			1
” soon thereafter , @entity3 asked his underlings about the investigation and was told that it had been killed — for journalistic reasons			2
he claims to have inquired no further , not even to ask what the investigation was about			0
‘ a few months later , the news broke in the @entity86 press that the @entity4 had , as @entity87 put it in a headline , “ shelved @entity10 sex abuse investigation ‘ to protect its own reputation			0
’ ” ‘ given the seriousness of sexual abuse allegations — look at what it did to @entity96 — you would think that @entity3 and his underlings would immediately want to get to the bottom of it			0
but , again , they did nothing			0
’ mr @entity3 , 55 , has made it clear he has the full support of his new bosses			1
@entity10 pictured at the @entity104 in @entity105 in 1965 ‘ i do not believe there is anything that i 've done in relation to this matter which should in anyway impinge on my abilities to fully discharge the responsibilities i 'll have at the @entity2 , ’ he insisted in an interview last week			0
but the columnist claimed that @entity2 chairman and publisher @entity114 is ‘ in a difficult spot			0
’ ‘ he believes strongly that he ’s got the executive he needs to lead the @entity2 to the promised land of healthy profits again , ’ he wrote			0
‘ although he declined to be interviewed for this column , he appears to have accepted @entity3 ’s insistence that he knew nothing about the explosive allegations that became public literally 50 days after he accepted the @entity2 job			1
@entity114 is backing his man unreservedly			0
‘ for the sake of @entity2 employees — not to mention the readers who want to see a vibrant @entity129 — let ’s hope his faith in @entity3 is warranted			2
‘ otherwise , the @entity4 wo n’t be the only organization being asked tough questions about its judgment			0

mr @entity3 has denied any knowledge of a @entity4 cover up and vowed to take up his new job in @entity14 as planned on november 12
but in a column published on monday , @entity15 questioned the *plausibility* of the former @entity4 director general ’s explanation of his role in the affair
