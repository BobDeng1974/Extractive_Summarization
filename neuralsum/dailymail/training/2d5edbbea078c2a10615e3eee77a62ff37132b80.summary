imagine ever time you took a plane journey , the aircraft was scrapped and a new one was built for your next flight			0
that 's the scenario facing space travel at the moment , with every part of a modern rocket that is sent to space either burning up in the atmosphere or being scrapped in an ocean on @entity13			0
but now that could be set to change , as after launching at 11.20am gmt ( 6.20am est ) today @entity15 will attempt to return part of a rocket to a floating barge , ushering in an age of reusability			1
at least , that was the plan - but a fault with the second stage of the rocket meant the launch had to be cancelled during the countdown , and they will have to try again on friday at 10.09am gmt ( 5.09am est )			1
the rocket would have attempted to land nine minutes after launching a @entity33 at 11.20am gmt ( 6.20am est ) , but the launch had to be postponed due to an unknown issue in their live feed for the launch @entity36 said the failure was due to an ' actuator drift issue ' with the second stage of the rocket			1
it is thought to have been an in issue with the thrust vector control for the rocket , which controls the direction of the thrust			0
this meant that during the countdown to launch , the fault was flagged up in the system and the countdown could not proceed			2
communications director for @entity15 @entity54 told @entity55 : ‘ during the terminal count engineers observed drift on one of the two thrust vector actuators on the second stage that would likely have caused an automatic abort			1
the @entity63 rocket carrying @entity33 will take off from @entity64 ’s @entity31			1
after launch , at a height of about 56 miles ( 90km ) , the first stage of the rocket will separate from the second stage			2
while the latter continues its mission into orbit , the former would usually be left to fall back into the ocean - as is the case on all other rocket launches			0
this is a costly operation causing the price of launches to top £ 280 million ( $ 440 million )			0
@entity15 , however , is attempting to develop rockets that can make soft landings back on @entity13 so they can be recovered and recycled			2
this could bring the cost of launching to space down by at least a factor of ten - making it much more accessible			0
eventually they also plan to return the second stage from orbit , allowing them to reassemble the rocket on the ground for another launch			1
‘ engineers called a hold in order to take a closer look			1
@entity15 is scrubbed for today and we are now targeting launch on 9 january at 5:09am est ( 10.09am gmt )			1
’ the launch of the @entity63 rocket will take place from @entity31 in @entity64			1
it will be carrying the unmanned @entity33 on its fifth scheduled cargo mission ( @entity103 - 5 ) to the @entity105 - and sixth flight to the station overall - under contract with @entity36			0
but while that is an achievement in itself , of more interest is @entity15 ’s plan after the launch			2
the attempted landing of the first stage of the rocket is expected about nine minutes after take - off			1
it will attempt to land on the @entity117 ( @entity118 ) , which is essentially a barge , in the @entity120			2
while there are cameras on the @entity118 , it ’s unlikely @entity15 will stream the landing attempt live , as they are unsure how successful the attempt will be			2
ceo @entity126 has said previously he thinks there is only a 50 per cent chance of success			1
however , successful or not , the test will be hugely important for the age of reusability			0
the various stages of rockets are normally left to fall into the ocean or burn up in the atmosphere after reaching space			0
@entity15 , though , wants to eventually make entire rockets reusable - like an airplane - allowing them to launch , land and then launch again			1
this mission will be a crucial step in that endeavour			0
the company has already tested the technology to land a rocket in a series of tests using the @entity149 concept vehicle			2
this was a rocket attached with landing legs that performed short ‘ hops ’ on @entity13 , to a height of a few hundred metres , to test the technology needed to land			2
and this time that same technology will be used to bring the rocket back from the edge of space			0
the incredible attempt will occur during the launch of the latest cargo - carrying @entity33 to the @entity105 , called the @entity103 - 5 mission , from @entity64 ’s @entity31			1
pictured is a previous falcon 9 launch on 14 july 2014 - when @entity15 tested the ability of the rocket to land , but over the ocean for now @entity15 is attempting to return only the first stage - the lower portion - of a rocket after launching			1
in future , they are hoping to return the entire rocket to ground			0
one of the key technologies in returning rockets will be ' grid fins ' , which are four small aerodynamical wings that extend from the rocket as it descends			0
on a previous launch to space on 14 july this year , the company employed grid fins on a falcon 9 rocket for the first time			2
they were able to bring the first stage of the rocket back to @entity13 and they performed a practice landing over the ocean without a floating barge			2
shortly before hitting the ocean it reignited its thrusters , proving that the rocket could successfully turn itself back on and perform a landing			0
on this occasion the rocket , after performing this test , simply fell into the ocean			0
but this next test will be a huge step towards reusability ‘ returning anything from space is a challenge , but returning a @entity63 9 first stage for a precision landing presents a number of additional hurdles , ’ the company said in a statement			1
‘ at 14 stories tall and traveling upwards of 1,300 metres ( nearly one mile ) per second , stabilising the @entity63 9 first stage for re-entry is like trying to balance a rubber broomstick on your hand in the middle of a wind storm			1
’ the first stage of the @entity63 rocket will attempt to touch down on a barge ( illustration shown ) after launching a @entity33 into space			1
it is the first ever attempt at landing a rocket on solid ground after launch , and could herald a new era of cheaper spaceflight the barge measures about 300 feet ( 90 metres ) long by 100 feet ( 30 metres ) wide , and also has wings that extend out to another 170 feet ( 50 metres )			1
according to @entity15 chief @entity126 , it also has ‘ thrusters repurposed from deep sea oil rigs ’ that can hold it in position within 10 feet ( three metres ) even in a storm			1
to control the rocket as it lands , the grid fins on its side control its pitch , yaw and roll			0
these are ‘ stowed on ascent and then deploy on re-entry for “ x-wing ” [ from @entity246 ] style control , ’ according to @entity126			2
and to slow it down as it descends it will save 15 per cent of its original fuel , allowing it to lower itself towards the ocean without the use of a parachute			0
grid fins ( seen here ) on the side of the first stage of the rocket will keep it steady as it descends to @entity13 , while it will save 15 per cent of its initial fuel in order to lower itself slowly to the ground whatever the outcome , @entity15 will use the data they glean to improve their technique and one day plan to perform this manoeuvre during every launch			1
cameras on board the barge will capture the entire descent , although it ’s unclear how much - if any - of this footage @entity15 will make public			2
eventually , they will start bringing the upper - or second - stage of the rocket back as well			0
the ultimate goal is to make the entire rocket reusable - which will drastically reduce the cost of going to space			0
@entity15 has a £ 1billion ( $ 1.6 billion ) contract with @entity36 to resupply the iss. this launch of the @entity33 will be the fifth of 12 scheduled missions			2
@entity126 ( pictured ) said the ambitious attempt has a 50 per cent chance of working			1
@entity15 ultimately wants all of its rockets to be reusable in order to reduce the cost of going to space the launch of the @entity63 rocket had originally been scheduled for late december			1
however , the launch was delayed then when some issues arose during a static fire test - which involves a brief ignition of the rocket ’s nine engines on the launchpad to test they work			0
the reason the delay was so long , until january , is that the @entity105 moved into a period of increased sunlight			0
for 10 days from 28 december to 7 january , the station was in almost constant light			0
this prohibited @entity33 from berthing with the station , as temperatures were too high			0
if all goes to plan after the launch , @entity33 will then rendezvous with the @entity105 at 11am gmt ( 6am est ) on thursday 8 january			0
‘ @entity36 and @entity15 announced today the launch of @entity15 ’s fifth commercial resupply services mission to the @entity105 now will occur no earlier than tuesday 6 january , ’ @entity36 said previously in a statement			1
‘ this will provide @entity15 engineers time to investigate further some of the issues that arose from the static fire test of the @entity63 rocket on 16 december			1
’ they added : ' the new launch date also will allow the teams to enjoy the holidays			0
' the barge ( shown ) measures about 300 feet ( 90 metres ) long by 100 feet ( 30 metres ) wide , and also has wings that extend out to another 170 feet ( 50 metres ) this launch of the @entity63 will be carrying @entity15 ’s unmanned @entity33 on its fifth scheduled cargo mission to the @entity105 - and sixth flight to the station overall - under contract with @entity36			1
the spacecraft is pictured here berthed with the @entity105 on a previous cargo mission			0

@entity15 has had to cancel their latest rocket launch after a fault
they had been planning to land part of a @entity63 9 on a barge today
the next launch attempt will be 10.09am gmt ( 5.09am est ) on friday
@entity15 said an ' actuator drift issue ' meant launch had to be aborted
this was a *problem* with the second stage of the rocket , although the exact reason for the cancellation is not yet known
‘ engineers called a hold in order to take a closer look , ' @entity15 communications director @entity54 told @entity55
the attempt would have taken place nine minutes after launch at 11.20am gmt from @entity31 in @entity64
it is the first ever attempt at landing a rocket on solid ground after launch
ceo @entity126 said the ambitious attempt has a 50 *%* chance of working
the company ultimately wants all of its rockets to be reusable
