by @entity0 published : 08:37 est , 17 june 2012 updated : 08:37 est , 17 june 2012 @entity1 is at the centre of a row over tobacco advertising after anti-smoking charities accused him of promoting a company that owns one of @entity9 's biggest cigarette brands			1
the @entity11 defender features in billboard advertisements and @entity14 videos in @entity15 that promote @entity17 's internet - based sports channel , @entity18			1
but the company is one of @entity15 's largest tobacco firms and its cigarettes , flavoured with spices such as cloves and cinnamon , are popular with children			1
apology : @entity11 said @entity1 was sorry for any misunderstanding resulting from his appearance in the ads a spokesman for @entity1 , who supports the global children 's charity @entity32 , insisted that the footballer , who does not smoke , was advertising the sports channel and not tobacco			1
it appears that @entity1 , one of many international football stars to appear in the ads , had been unaware that @entity17 makes much of its profits from tobacco or that his image would be used on billboards which carry the cigarette brand logo			2
its @entity47 channel shows @entity49 football matches and helps to raise the profile of @entity52 football in @entity9 , the spokesman added that @entity1 was consulting lawyers about the use of his image in the campaign			0
talking point : the clip with @entity11 defender @entity1 the @entity59 predicts smoking will kill one billion people worldwide this century			2
@entity62 , chief executive of the anti-smoking group @entity63 , said sponsorship deals such as this were banned in the @entity66 because of concerns that they promoted cigarettes to young people			0
she also called on @entity1 to dissociate himself from @entity17			2
' @entity70 talks a good talk about putting children first when he tweets for @entity32 , but he has to put his money where his mouth is , ' ms @entity62 told @entity76			0
' well over a third of 15 - year - old boys in @entity15 smoke and smoking rates among the young have increased sixfold since 1995			0
' @entity70 is estimated to be worth £ 40m and to earn more than £ 100,000 a week ; does he really need to do this ? ' i hope now he realises what he 's done he 'll apologise			0
' separately , @entity15 's @entity84 has written to the @entity11 manager sir @entity86 urging him ' to have this unhealthy promotion removed immediately '			1
in the @entity14 videos , @entity1 , wearing a red football kit and displaying the @entity17 corporate badge , says how ' football is everything and everything about football is only on @entity47 '			0
the final scene cuts to the @entity47 logo , which is then followed by the @entity98 logo and a tobacco health warning			0
the gaffer : @entity11 boss sir @entity86 tobacco firms worldwide are keen to cultivate the next generation of smokers , but their efforts are hampered by blanket advertising bans in @entity106			2
no such laws apply in @entity15 , where @entity17 also operates a music website - which anti-smoking groups claim is another attempt to reach young people			1
@entity112 , the director of @entity113 , which is campaigning for cigarettes to be sold in plain packets in the @entity66 , said : ' i do n't believe that it is a coincidence that @entity17 chose a @entity11 player to promote their brand sponsorship of @entity15 football , as the iconic @entity11 kit so closely resembles their own cigarette brand colours			1
' @entity124 , from the @entity123 , told @entity125 : ' we must be concerned about the prevalence of smoking internationally , particularly in the developing world , where it is a major killer			0
' it is particularly galling to see a prominent @entity66 celebrity recognised by young football supporters the world over participating in such a distasteful and ill - advised campaign			0
' a @entity11 spokeswoman told @entity76 : ' the contractual agreement between @entity70 and @entity136 runs to 31 october 2012 , at which time all forms of advertising will cease			1
' both @entity11 and @entity1 are sorry for this misunderstanding and will endeavour to ensure that it is not repeated in the future			2

anti-smoking charities accuse the @entity11 star of promoting @entity15 tobacco firm @entity17
@entity11 say @entity70 is ' sorry for this misunderstanding '
