at just over five months old , @entity2 was brought to the centre after being rescued in the @entity14			2

creature comfort : anzac the joey and @entity4 the wombat have become best friends after sharing a pouch together at the @entity10 in @entity11 , @entity12 happy pairing : at just over five months old , @entity2 was brought to the centre after being rescued in the @entity14			1
missing his mum , @entity2 was placed with wombat @entity4 and the two now sleep together luckily he was placed with @entity4 , who was also feeling lonely and the two now sleep together , reducing the amount @entity2 misses his mum			1
worker @entity29 explained the unlikely friends are comforted by each others movement and heartbeat			2
she said : ' there are lots of baby animals about at the moment , and they are orphaned for a range of reasons			0
' one of the reasons the lively duo get on so well is their similar personalities - with @entity2 described as very social while @entity4 is boisterous and cheeky			2

comforting cuddle : worker @entity29 said the unlikely friends are comforted by each other 's movement and heartbeat opposites attract : one of the reasons the lively duo get on so well is their similar personalities - with @entity2 described as very social while @entity4 is boisterous and cheeky although they appear to be slow and docile , wombats are very alert and can move quickly with great agility when needed			1
but in contrast kangaroos can move a lot quicker and hop so efficiently that they can reach great speeds			0
although tiny at the moment as they get older their sizes will also start to differ greatly			0
@entity4 will become powerfully built , weighing about 30kg - about the size of a small pig , although wombats are rarely dangerous			0
but @entity2 will become a lot taller and weigh about anything upwards of 30kg			0
luckily they are both herbivores so they wo n't be a threat to each other and if their friendship does continue they could spend their days side - by - side looking for luscious blades of green grass and leaves .			0
