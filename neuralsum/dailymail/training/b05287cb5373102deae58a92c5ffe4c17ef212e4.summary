by @entity0 published : 04:19 est , 4 february 2013 updated : 04:19 est , 4 february 2013 the government is set to allow supermarkets to continue to sell mince which is less than 50 per cent meat despite @entity6 rules aiming to crack down on mislabelling of food			1
officials say that stopping retailers from bulking up mince with fat and connective tissue would cost the industry hundreds of thousands of pounds a year			0
but with the revelation following closely on from the recent horsemeat scandal , it could raise further fears that @entity18 are inadvertently eating impure food			1
rules : the @entity6 is cracking down on the amount of meat found in minced pork and beef ( file photo ) @entity6 regulations set to be introduced next year will impose strict limits on the amount of fat and collagen which can be included in minced beef and pork			1
lean beef mince will be allowed to contain no more than 19 per cent filler , while regular beef mince will have up to 35 per cent			1
minced pork will be allowed nearly as much filler as meat , with a maximum of 48 per cent collagen and fat			1
@entity42 , which is best known for its role in cosmetic surgery , is a protein found in animals ' tendons			0
currently a large proportion of the meat on @entity18 supermarket shelves breaches the purity regulations , meaning it could no longer be labelled as mince once the @entity6 rules came into force			2
ministers have therefore asked for an exemption - or ' derogation ' - to the new regulations in order to safeguard the @entity18 's food industry , according to the @entity60			1
opt - out : @entity62 officials are seeking to exempt @entity18 supermarkets from the rule in an ' impact assessment ' of the rules issued last year , officials wrote : ' a significant proportion of mince meat currently sold in the @entity18 contains a greater proportion of collagen than would be permitted			2
' adopting this derogation avoids costs to businesses arising from not being able to sell such minced meat in the @entity18 as minced meat			2
' the government claims that if the regulations were imposed in full , they would cost food manufacturers more than Â£ 800,000 a year			2
however , @entity80 mp @entity79 attacked ministers for failing to safeguard consumers , describing the plans as a ' national disgrace '			0
' why should @entity18 people eat mince which is not the same standard as the rest of @entity89 ? ' , he said to the @entity60			1
' they seem to be more concerned with wiping out regulations than in what consumers are eating			0
' a spokesman for the @entity93 and @entity94 said that a ' final decision ' had not yet been made on how to implement the rules			0
' these regulations are about striking the right balance between improved information for consumers and red tape on food businesses , ' he added			0
minced meat has been in the headlines over the past few weeks after it emerged that a number of supermarkets had been selling hamburgers which contained horse meat			0
the contaminated mince came from a factory in @entity111 , which blamed it on a supplier in @entity114 .			0

@entity89 regulations set limit of 35 **%** filler for minced beef and 48 **%** for pork
but ministers have *requested* exemption for @entity18
fears move could harm *quality* of food for @entity18
