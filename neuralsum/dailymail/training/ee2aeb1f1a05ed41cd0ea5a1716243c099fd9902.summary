by @entity0 for @entity1 and @entity2 for @entity1 @entity3 will cap a stunning start to his first - team career at @entity6 with a promotion to the @entity9 squad for next month ’s clash with world champions @entity11			1
the 21 - year - old has won a rapid promotion from @entity16 ’s @entity15 after four goals in his first seven games for the @entity20 club			1
three of his strikes have come in @entity24 away games in @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27 , taking @entity29 ’s side to within 90 minutes of the @entity31 group stage			1
caught the eye : @entity3 , pictured celebrating against @entity33 , has impressed in the early weeks of season not fazed by the big stage : the 21 - year - old has scored three goals in @entity6 's away fixtures in @entity39 and the midfielder , praised highly by new @entity6 boss @entity29 last week , will win his reward when @entity43 ’s names his squad for the first qualifying game of the @entity47 campaign in @entity48 on monday morning			1
meanwhile , @entity3 wants the @entity50 champions to harness the power of @entity20 against @entity27 in their @entity31 play - off on tuesday night			1
@entity29 ’s men are on the brink of maximising their reprieve and landing a £ 15million group stage jackpot after @entity3 ’s goal earned a 1 - 1 first - leg draw last week away from home			2
the decisive return match will be the first @entity24 outing for @entity6 in their home stadium this season , as its use in the @entity65 forced a switch to @entity67 for previous rounds			1
back of the net : @entity70 , left , wheels away after opening the scoring against @entity27 on august 20 leading the way : the youngster has been one of @entity6 's stand - out players so far this campaign and @entity3 believes an intense atmosphere inside @entity20 – which has four times the capacity of @entity27 ’s ground – can play a crucial role in unsettling the visitors			1
‘ the games at @entity67 had a lot of people there , about 40,000 , but it ’s still not the same as playing at @entity20 , ’ said the 21 - year - old			1
‘ the crowd gets going on a @entity24 night and that puts a wee bit pressure on the away team			2
‘ maybe they ( @entity27 ) are not so used to playing in front of big crowds like that			0
hopefully we can get the crowd going and spook them a little bit - and get at them right from the start			2
’ fans ' favourite : the midfielder has represented @entity50 at every youth level in the last five years while fully appreciative of the positive impact of playing on home turf , @entity3 believes it also important @entity6 do n’t adopt a gung - ho attitude and leave themselves too open			1
@entity27 were content to hit on the break in their home leg and look certain to adopt a similar approach in @entity111			0
@entity29 attempted to ensure key players were rested ahead of the potentially season - defining game by making 10 changes for saturday ’s trip to @entity116			2
yet the move came at a cost as a shadow side slipped to a 1 - 0 defeat against the early @entity122 pacesetters			2
making a name for himself : a group of @entity116 players put pressure on @entity3 during saturday 's match ‘ the boys are not under any impression that the job is finished against @entity27 , ’ insisted @entity3 , who came on as a second - half substitute against @entity116			1
‘ we know exactly what we have to do to get the result			0
all the energy will go into that			0
‘ we dominated possession in the first half over there but you are always susceptible to the counter attack			0
we know what we have to do			0
‘ we will have a lot of the ball and the fans will be on our side as well			0
we just have to be careful we do n’t get caught the other side by throwing too many bodies forward at the one time			0
‘ we have to play the game and not listen to the crowd too much			0
they will be really eager for us to go and attack but we have to get a good balance in the team and attack at the right times			0
i ’m sure we ’ll be ready for it			0

the 20 - year - old will be *included* in @entity43 's squad for @entity50 's *friendly* against @entity11 next month
@entity3 , who has played at under 21 level for his country , has been in fine form this season , scoring four times in his first seven games
three of his goals have come in @entity24 away games as @entity6 fight to make it through to the @entity31 group stages
