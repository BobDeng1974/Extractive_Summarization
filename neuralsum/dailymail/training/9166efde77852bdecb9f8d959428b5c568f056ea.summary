top officials from the @entity1 and @entity2 defended secretary of state @entity3 on monday against charges in the @entity2 press that his efforts to secure a cease - fire in @entity8 leaned toward helping the terror group @entity9			1
speaking at the @entity11 , @entity10 said the @entity13 administration is ' dismayed by some press reports in @entity2 mischaracterizing his efforts last week to achieve a cease - fire			1
' ' we know these misleading reports in turn raise concerns here at home in @entity1			0
' @entity3 is seen among hawkish @entity2 as a moderating force whose insistence on military withdrawals will aid @entity9 in its guerrilla warfare			1
the @entity27 group has taken to digging @entity29 - style ' terror tunnels ' in order to gain quick access to targets in areas of @entity9 controlled by @entity2			1
president @entity13 on sunday urged @entity2 prime minister @entity34 to agree to an ' immediate , unconditional humanitarian cease - fire ' with @entity9			1

' @entity57 and @entity10 spoke alongside house speaker @entity68 , @entity70 minority whip @entity69 , and the leaders of major @entity73 advocacy groups			0
the @entity74 and the @entity75 hosted the event			0

those characterizations had the @entity70 ' fuming ' on monday , according to the @entity85			0
dissent : a pro-palestinian protester interrupted the @entity73 summit on monday as more than 600 advocates for @entity2 looked on in a post on liberal news publication @entity93 's website over the weekend , diplomatic correspondent @entity90 said @entity3 did more to ' thwart the possibility of reaching a cease - fire in @entity8 ' than he did to promote one			1
he went on to say @entity3 would be ' responsible for every additional drop of blood that is spilled ' if his actions resulted in an escalation of @entity2 military aggression			2
' @entity3 is n’t anti-israeli ; on the contrary , he ’s a true friend to @entity2 , ' @entity90 wrote			2
' but his conduct in recent days over the @entity8 cease - fire raises serious doubts over his judgment and perception of regional events			1
' it ’s as if he is n’t the foreign minister of the world ’s most powerful nation , but an alien , who just disembarked his spaceship in the @entity116			0

' as of sunday , more than a thousand @entity27 had been killed in the conflict and up to 6,000 others had been injured , according to @entity85 nearly four dozen @entity2 soldiers and three civilians and three civilians have also been killed			0
in excerpts of an interview with @entity9 leader @entity154 that aired sunday and monday on @entity155 , @entity151 told @entity156 that ' the world has two choices ' – to help @entity9 ' peacefully ' remove @entity2 from the @entity159 and the @entity8 or ' we will expel this occupation from our land			1
' ' we are not fanatics			0
we do not , actually , fight the @entity73 because they are @entity73 per se – we fight the occupiers , ' he said			0
@entity9 will keep fighting the ' occupiers , ' he said , until it is victorious			0
' i can die because of @entity2			0
i can not live under the occupation			0
the occupation is the worst thing that you can ever imagine , ' he said			0
' so every single @entity27 can die for the next generations to live in peace and freedom			0
' @entity154 danced around whether @entity9 would ' coexist with the state of @entity2 ' if @entity180 had its own state before telling @entity182 , ' when we have a @entity27 state , then the @entity27 state will decide on its policies , ' adding that the ' @entity27 people can have their say , when they have their own state , without occupation			2
' @entity192 secretary general @entity191 said today that both @entity34 and @entity154 were ' morally wrong ' for allowing the death and destruction to continue and the two men need to show ' compassionate leadership ' by ending the armed conflict			0
he joined @entity13 and the @entity198 in calling for ' an immediate and unconditional humanitarian cease - fire , ' saying that ' @entity8 is in critical condition			1
' @entity191 also said @entity2 's retaliation against @entity9 raises ' serious questions about proportionality			2
' his statement follows a @entity206 resolution last week approving an international investigation into @entity2 for potential war crimes in @entity8			2
@entity1 senator @entity209 , a @entity210 , said on sunday that he would ' condemn ' the report because it places the blame for the conflict on @entity2			2
' the @entity206 report is a joke , ' @entity209 said in comments reported by @entity217			0
' the @entity192 is becoming anti-israeli , anti-semitic			0
' throughout @entity2 it was secretary @entity3 who was the subject of mockery in weekend commentary			2
@entity223 columnist @entity222 called @entity3 ' an ongoing embarrassment , with the characteristics of a snowball			0
' ' the further he rolls , the greater the embarrassment , ' @entity222 said			0
@entity2 tv reporter @entity227 ran a report citing government officials who framed @entity3 as ' incapable of handling the most basic matters			2
' the @entity85 said monday that @entity13 administration officials said on background that by ridiculing @entity3 , @entity2 ministers ' crossed a line ' and relations between @entity2 and the @entity1 may never be as close as it once was as a result			1
in on the record comments deputy national security adviser @entity237 came to @entity3 's defense			1

secretary of state @entity3 tried to negotiate a long - term cease - fire between @entity2 and @entity9 last week but was *unsuccessful*
a chorus of *naysayers* *emerged* in the @entity2 press , *slamming* him for *meddling* and trying to slow down @entity2 advances in @entity8
one journalist compared @entity3 to a space alien who is *unfamiliar* with the *dynamics* on the ground
@entity1 national security adviser @entity38 and @entity2 ambassador to the @entity1 @entity43 defended @entity3 on monday , but in soft language
@entity13 wants @entity2 to agree to an ' immediate , unconditional humanitarian cease - fire '
