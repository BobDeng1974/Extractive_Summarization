by @entity0 published : 09:18 est , 1 november 2012 updated : 01:06 est , 2 november 2012 it 's a hobby enjoyed the world over - what could be better than spending a few hours kayaking across a shimmering mountain lake admiring the stunning scenery while keeping fit ? unfortunately , transporting all that bulky equipment around can prove a real headache and then you 've got to find somewhere to store it			0
but now , an enterprising kayak enthusiast from @entity12 has come up with an ingenious solution - a 12 - foot long kayak that can fold away into a small plastic case			1
the @entity16 : the @entity17 looks like any normal kayak , but can be folded away into a small plastic case and re-assembled within five minutes compact : the plastic case measures 32in by 29in and weighs 25lbs			1
it can fit in the boot of a car or checked into the hold of an aircraft resilient : the fold - up kayak is just as durable as a normal moulded one and has a lifetime guarantee of 20,000 folds @entity32 , an architect by trade , has designed the origami boat after being forced to pay for storage when he could n't fit a conventional kayak into his apartment			1
the @entity17 kayak folds into a compact case measuring 32in by 29in and weighing 25lb which can be stored anywhere - even in the luggage hold when flying			1
when unfolded , mr @entity32 , 36 , says you can assemble it and be out on the water in five minutes			2
fully equipped : a standard fold - away paddle can fit easily inside the kayak when packed into the plastic case plenty of space : the @entity17 is 12ft long and 25 inches wide transportable : @entity51 says the @entity17 can be carried anywhere			1
the architect and kayak enthusiast had not been able to store his boat in his apartment he said : ' i grew up in rural @entity12 , kayaking the rivers and coast			0
when i moved to the city a few years ago , i had to put my kayak in storage , as it would n't fit in my apartment			2
' at the same time , i read a magazine article on new advances in the art and science of origami , and started thinking - ' what if a boat could fold up like a piece of paper ? ' ' the @entity73 is made of a single , seamless sheet of corrugated plastic			0
it 's a heavy - duty version of a material often used for packaging and signage			0
testing the waters : kayakers try out the @entity17 on still waters , but the inventor says it will also withstand extreme conditions sense of adventure : the @entity17 kayak is available later this month and costs £ 500 ' it 's very tough and durable , as well as lightweight			1
we have tested it in extreme conditions , including ocean surf , and never had a skin breach			0
' the case can hold a breakdown paddle , life jacket , and other accessories too			0
' what 's more , the @entity17 is fully recyclable and used 70 per cent less petroleum to manufacture than its standard moulded counterparts			0
mr @entity32 claims the kayak is guaranteed for 20,000 folds throughout its lifetime			1
the @entity73 will be available for pre-order nov 14th from @entity107 , for £ 500			2
