the @entity1 soldier was investigated for possible war crimes for tapping the suspect on the nose with a piece of paper a @entity1 soldier was investigated for possible war crimes for thrusting a piece of paper at a @entity14 fighter , it has emerged			1
he was accused of abuse for touching the terror suspect on the nose with the sheet during a routine interrogation in @entity20			1
the enemy fighter had been captured and detained as a potential ringleader in the murder and mutilation of four @entity26 soldiers in 2008			1
but it was the military intelligence officer , who had an exemplary record , who was investigated for possible war crimes amid claims he had broken rules banning the touching of prisoners during interrogation			1
on another occasion an interrogator was probed for shouting in a suspect ’s ear in case he burst an ear drum , it was claimed			2
the investigation is said to have taken place four years after the alleged offence			0
the incidents came to light after the @entity50 tightened the rules governing tactical questioning in the wake of several highly - damaging allegations that @entity1 troops abused captives in their custody			1
the changes have led to considerable disquiet in the military that soldiers are being hampered in their ability to extract information from insurgents that could potentially save lives			2
last week , the @entity68 report into the fallout from a firefight in @entity71 in 2004 which became known as the @entity73 concluded that insurgents and their families had used ‘ deliberate lies ’ to smear @entity1 troops			1
sir @entity78 , who led the £ 31million inquiry , found that claims soldiers murdered , mutilated and tortured detainees were ‘ wholly and entirely without merit ’			0
but while blasting the @entity71 and their legal aid - funded @entity1 lawyers , the 1,250 - page report also turned the spotlight on nine examples of military intelligence officers abusing @entity71 detainees during questioning , although these instances were found to be ‘ relatively minor ’			1
colonel @entity92 , who was awarded an obe for his service during the @entity71 war , said he blamed ' ambulance chasing lawyers ' for the new rules on interrogation one soldier was criticised for walking around a captured and blindfolded @entity71 insurgent and blowing gently on his neck , which sir @entity78 said ‘ amounted to a form of ill - treatment ’			1
the soldier was also castigated for banging a metal tent peg on a table to startle the prisoner , shouting in the man ’s ear and warning him he would never see his wife if he refused to co-operate			1
following the revelations , a former senior @entity113 interrogator , who served in @entity71 and @entity20 , told the @entity115 : ‘ there was an incident in 2008 when @entity26 soldiers were massacred and the bodies of four of them were mutilated			1
‘ we had two of the suspects in detention and they were brought in for questioning			0
‘ one of the interrogators touched one of the suspects on the nose with an @entity130 piece of paper and he was investigated by the special investigation branch for abuse			1
‘ just for touching a detainee on the nose			0
the fact somebody could be investigated for that is to my mind incredible			0
these @entity26 soldiers had been horribly mutilated and yet it was the interrogator who was investigated			1
’ blaming @entity50 lawyers , the former soldier said : ‘ we once had in for questioning a well - known @entity14 fighter			2
‘ he did n’t say a word ; he would n’t speak to us and when he eventually did all he would say through the translator was : “ your detention policy is toothless ”			0
‘ we would have these suspects in and there we are worried about what the lawyers in @entity1 are going to say			2
these are really bad people			0
‘ they murder women and children and all we can think about is did we shout in their ear and will we get investigated for that ? that ’s how ridiculous it got			2
’ colonel @entity92 , who made a celebrated eve - of - battle speech during the @entity71 war , said he blamed ‘ ambulance - chasing lawyers ’ and ‘ play - it - safe judges ’ for the new rules on interrogation			2
he said : ‘ we are no longer able to carry out tactical questioning			0
that in itself brings risks to the lives of the people we deploy			0
‘ these insurgents are not nice people			0
they behead people ; they keep sex slaves			0
they are not normal people			0
