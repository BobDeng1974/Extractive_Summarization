the @entity3 has said the government must urgently do something to halt @entity7 's terrible air pollution ministers must urgently tackle @entity7 ’s abysmal air pollution , the @entity3 ruled yesterday			1
the @entity7 has repeatedly failed to meet clean air targets , leaving most of our cities clogged with pollution that is estimated to kill 29,000 people a year			1
the @entity16 court yesterday found that the @entity7 was in breach of @entity19 law and should have created plans to tackle air pollution in 16 cities by january 2015 at the latest			1
under existing plans , the worst areas - including @entity2 , @entity25 and @entity26 - would not meet the pollution limits until 2030 , campaigners say			2
@entity7 breached @entity19 targets in 2010 for levels of nitrogen dioxide , a gas particle from car engines and factories which causes breathing and heart problems			1
it is still nowhere near adequate levels , and has repeatedly asked to be granted extensions to the @entity19 deadline			2
the @entity16 court , which is based in @entity41 , ruled that the @entity7 ’s @entity42 now has jurisdiction over the matter and must order the government to take action to meet the legal limits in a much shorter time frame			1
the government is also facing a separate £ 300million fine for failing to meet the @entity19 ’s air quality directive on pollution			1
some 16 areas including @entity2 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 and the @entity56 are currently in breach of the targets			2
the problem was dramatically illustrated in april when a thick smog enveloped the country , forcing people to stop exercising and schools to keep their children inside			0
environmental lawyers @entity67 , who brought the case against @entity71 , the government ’s environment department , said the ruling is likely to mean rolling out @entity2 ’s planned ‘ ultralow emissions zone ’ to cities across the country			0
the plan , drawn up by @entity77 , will mean charging diesel car owners £ 10 to enter the city centre and scrapping old taxis			0
@entity67 lawyer @entity81 said : ‘ thousands of people die because of air pollution every year			2
this ruling will save lives by forcing the government to finally take this issue seriously			0
’ @entity2 's @entity88 is barely visible due to the heavy pollution blanketing the capital shadow environment secretary @entity91 said : ‘ this @entity3 judgement is a damning indictment of the @entity95 - led @entity86 ’s total failure to tackle the @entity7 ’s air pollution			1
‘ air pollution is a serious public health issue facing our towns and cities , tens of thousands of lives are lost each year and yet @entity104 ’s government has done nothing to solve the problem			1
‘ the @entity3 has now demanded that the @entity7 take urgent action to address dangerous levels of air pollution			1
’ @entity110 ( pictured ) is among the worst centres for smog and pollution in @entity7 @entity114 , of the @entity115 , said : ‘ this judgement means the @entity86 is finally being held to account for their breach of air pollution limits			1
‘ breathing certain pollutants is proven to exacerbate existing heart conditions and put vulnerable people at greater risk of a heart attack			0
‘ the public expect the air we breathe to be safe			0
officials must act now to improve the quality of the air we breathe			0
’ and @entity132 campaigner @entity131 said : ‘ @entity7 air quality is a national disgrace - tough measures are long overdue			2
’ the ruling came as the @entity137 published its latest annual air quality report , which showed that almost a fifth of people living in @entity7 cities are exposed to nitrogen dioxide levels up to 50 per cent above @entity19 limits			1
a picture taken in 2007 shows factories in @entity146 , @entity147 , belching out smoke mp @entity149 , chair of the parliamentary @entity150 , added : ‘ ministers have complacently carried on with business as usual and put off serious efforts to deal with the problem for another decade			0
‘ it is not acceptable for ministers who live in leafy suburbs to tell people living next to busy roads in towns and cities that they have to wait until 2030 to breath clean air			0
’ a @entity71 spokesman said : ‘ air quality has improved significantly in recent years and average roadside concentrations of @entity168 levels have fallen 15 per cent since 2010			0
‘ we have built on this by committing £ 2 billion since 2011 to increase the uptake of ultra-low emission vehicles , green transport initiatives and supporting local authorities to take action			0
