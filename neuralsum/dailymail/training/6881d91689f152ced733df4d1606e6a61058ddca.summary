@entity0 has quite literally been been prepared to go to @entity1 and back to make a name for himself			1
a former pupil of @entity4 , @entity0 thought he had fulfilled his boyhood dreams when he joined @entity6 but he was never satisfied with sitting at the back of his class			1
' i was a local boy and @entity6 are my club , ten minutes from my home , but i had to get away and if it meant going 200 miles to play regular football then so be it , ' says the @entity1 midfielder			1
former @entity6 midfielder @entity0 has thrived at @entity1 ' it was my decision			1
i 'd had too many broken promises over the years at @entity6 ; coaches saying i would get my chance if i played well then you would find another eight midfielders suddenly ahead of you , ' adds @entity0			1
he 's made the breakthrough now but it should have happened three years ago when he was playing even better in my opinion			2
' i dipped my toe in the water with @entity1 by going on loan and found everything i wanted			1
i enjoyed every minute and @entity29 and his staff were straight - talking , there was no sugar coating , just this is how it is			2
it was a breath of fresh air			2
' the appreciation was mutual and @entity1 made him their then record £ 8million signing in the summer despite interest from the likes of @entity41 and others			1
@entity43 is a personable character and it 's quickly apparent that , after years of frustration , he is enjoying his football			2
@entity0 joined @entity1 from @entity6 for £ 8million after a successful loan spell his middle name is @entity50 , ' after his grandfather , not the @entity53 defender @entity52 ' , though ' he was a decent footballer and passed on some good genes ' and his nickname is ' @entity56 ' , or at least the only one he can repeat , which is owed to the pencil - thin moustache he has been cultivating albeit ' without much success '			1
however , while he has ambitions for his moustache , it is his reputation as a one of @entity64 's most promising midfielders that he would prefer to cultivate			1
@entity43 has one @entity64 cap , awarded after he came on for @entity67 in a 2 - 1 win over @entity69 in 2012 , and has been encouraged by @entity71 's recent selections that he can maybe stake a claim to at least earn a second one			1
' i 've got a 100 percent record as an @entity64 player , ' he laughs			1
' i 'd love to play for my country again			0
mr @entity71 picked me that night and i 'd love another chance			0
it 's something all players aspire to			0
@entity81 has shown that if you continue to play well you can earn your reward and that has to be my aim at @entity1			1
if i play well hopefully mr @entity71 will take a look			0
' @entity0 thought he had fulfilled his boyhood dreams when he joined @entity6 @entity43 , 24 , is part of an exciting , fluid midfield alongside his pal @entity89 , @entity90 and @entity91 at @entity1 but saturday pits him against a player he has always used as his yardstick in @entity95 's @entity94			1
' i used to study @entity96 , who is a hell of a player , but @entity94 has been my hero since i turned professional , ' enthuses @entity0			2
' i played against him for @entity6 once when he was coming back from injury and i learned more in ten minutes than i did in four years from coaching			2
he not only had supreme confidence in his own ability but he gave it to those around him			0
' he brought a calmness to their game and dictated the pace			0
as a midfielder , one of the most difficult aspects is finding space but his movement was such he made it look easy			2
if i emulate anything close to what he has done in the game it would be fantastic			0
' @entity0 ( right ) believes at 24 he can add to his one cap for @entity64 not that @entity0 will be standing back and admiring @entity95 's talisman on saturday			1
' he is a leader and he will be getting them up for the game after their result against @entity124 but i 'd like to earn respect by playing well against him			0
whatever happened we would expect a tough game but we 've got a good bunch here at @entity1			2
' people ask '' who 's the joker in your group ? '' but we have about 30 of them			0
we 've got a great team spirit and plenty of quality			0
the manager has attracted players such as @entity138 , @entity139 and @entity140 ; nearly all of us are players with something to prove who have been given a second chance			0
that gives us a certain edge			0
' i thought i 'd got rid of @entity146 ! but he followed me here because he knew we were building something special			0
like myself and @entity89 , he still wants to show what he can do and it means we are putting together a few surprise performances like we did at @entity152 last week			0
' @entity71 take note , everyone deserves a second chance .			0
