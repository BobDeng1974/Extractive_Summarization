@entity0 was told in no uncertain terms in the summer there needed to be a change to his style of play			1
after @entity7 beat @entity8 2 - 1 on saturday , @entity6 asked @entity7 blogger @entity9 if @entity0 is getting the credit he deserves for turning things around			1
@entity0 has made a bright start to the season at @entity7 and has bedded in his summer signings we are known famously as a very hard bunch to impress , us @entity7 fans			1
just ask @entity18 , or @entity19			0
they both helped lift the club to the promised land of @entity24 football , yet they both will tell you that if the team starts underperforming , the fans will be straight on your back			0
another man who will no doubt echo this view is @entity0			2
@entity0 has endured a turbulent relationship with the clubs fans since taking over as boss in 2011 , and it was n’t so long ago that the vast majority of supporters , including myself , were calling for the clubs owners to dispense with @entity0			2
we had just witnessed a season in which , yes survival was reached , but achieved in a manner that simply was n’t deemed acceptable in east @entity43			0
the negative , fingers - crossed style football which we had come accustomed to under @entity0 had simply run its course – and it had to stop			2
sir @entity47 said the @entity7 way was a myth but @entity0 is proving that it is very real sir @entity47 is wrong , the @entity7 way is not a ‘ myth ’ - it is very real , and we are witnessing first hand this season just how important it is to play the right way , the @entity7 way			1
it is not based on results			0
yes , of course we want to see our team win ; it ’s what they ’re on that pitch to do			0
but it ’s how the team go about their business that we @entity7 fans are particularly fussy about			2
it ’s about going onto that pitch and putting your body on the line , giving everything for the team , and most importantly attacking the opposition with desire and imagination			0
@entity0 was told in no uncertain terms over the summer that he had to deliver the @entity7 way brand style of football this season – especially when playing at home			1
many , like myself , did not believe @entity0 could deliver on this , but i am willing to accept that our manager , so far this season , has proved me wrong			0
@entity85 is just one of a whole host of signings that has given the supporters plenty to smile about the signings made by the club this summer have simply transformed the team into one that looks more than capable of holding their own in the @entity24			1
@entity96 , @entity85 , @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity99 , @entity100 and @entity101 all signed permanent contracts with the club , while @entity104 and @entity105 arrived on season - long loan deals			1
then behind the scenes , @entity107 joined @entity110 backroom team as the new attacking coach			0
these are changes that were made by the owners , and our manager , to make sure that they delivered on what the fans demanded – and i believe now @entity0 deserves credit where it ’s due			1
@entity96 scored a fine goal against @entity122 in the @entity24 and has been in impressive form to be fair to @entity0 he always delivers on what is asked of him – promotion at the first attempt , retaining our @entity24 status – and so far is delivering on playing the brand of football that has been asked			1
the time has come for us fans gave @entity0 our full support – as rare as that is in football these days			2
there is a real buzz around @entity138 at present , and the last thing we need is our manager turned on by the supporters the moment a match is lost			0
if @entity0 continues to deliver the way he has so far this season , then who ’s to say where it will end ? follow @entity148 on @entity149 @ mcrugrid			0

@entity0 made several summer signings at @entity7
@entity85 , @entity96 and @entity104 have all impressed
sir @entity47 has called the @entity7 a myth
@entity7 beat @entity8 2 - 1 on saturday
@entity0 is delivering what the fans demanded and deserves credit
