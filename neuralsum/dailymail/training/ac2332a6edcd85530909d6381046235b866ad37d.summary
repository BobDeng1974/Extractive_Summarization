‘ i was pleased when the draw was made because you want to be playing against best teams			0
@entity24 were the best team in @entity33 and have the best players too			1
facing the likes of @entity0 and @entity1 can only make you improve and help your own game			1
‘ it is a big game for us and a big test			0
but we ’ll go into it and play without any fear			0
’ two years ago , the prospect of @entity21 feeling confident about taking on the world ’s best would have been laughable			2
@entity0 ( left ) , @entity44 ( centre ) and @entity1 ( right ) in training for @entity24 at @entity47 but the 24 - year - old ’s progress under @entity50 has been astonishing and he is now an automatic pick for both @entity23 and @entity52			1
his famed stamina and athleticism has led @entity50 to declare he is the only player in the country who can dominate games without the ball			0
the club are currently trying to extend his current contract , which has 18 months left			0
‘ to be honest , i ’ve always had that ability to move well about the pitch			0
it ’s the way i ’ve played since i was very little - with passion			0
i love playing football and give everything i ’ve got every time i play , ’ he said			0
‘ being made @entity67 ’s vice-captain at @entity23 is a huge honour for me personally and shows how far i ’ve come in a couple of years			2
i ’m really enjoying that role and grateful for the manager to give me that level of responsibility			0
@entity21 ( left ) has been named vice-captain to @entity67 at @entity23 @entity23 beat @entity24 4 - 0 in the @entity7 in 2009 in their only previous meeting at @entity3 ‘ i tend not to listen too much to any praise i ’m getting too much because you do n’t want to get carried away			1
i just have to focus on football and learn from people around me			0
that ’s all i can do			0
’ while @entity24 ’s front - four of @entity0 , @entity1 , @entity44 and @entity81 are known throughout the world , @entity23 will be disappointed their main striker @entity83 misses on the big stage again following calf and thigh injuries			1
‘ @entity83 is a massive player for club and country , a fantastic talent , ’ acknowledged @entity21			2
‘ i played in my first @entity7 game against @entity91 this season and now we ’ve got a really big @entity29 night ahead			1
‘ @entity3 is always a brilliant stadium and the fans are fantastic			2
last season it went up another level			0
hopefully they can continue that and in sure they will be even more brilliant against @entity24			2
’ there are seven survivors from the last time @entity23 ’s met @entity24 in the 2009 @entity7 – @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 and @entity103 for the @entity14 , and @entity104 , @entity105 and @entity67 for @entity23 .			1
