by @entity0 last updated at 9:50 am on 19th october 2011 @entity2 and @entity1 outside @entity3 yesterday , for the trial of @entity5 @entity5 's mother wept in court yesterday as photographs were shown of her daughter 's dead body			2
until that point , @entity1 and her husband @entity2 had chosen not to be present during those parts of the murder trial when images of the 25 - year - old 's corpse were displayed to the jury			2
mrs @entity1 , 58 , broke down as a mortuary image of the landscape architect was shown on court screens before she and her husband both averted their eyes			2
the picture showed miss @entity1 lying in the foetal position with her pink top pushed up , exposing her bra			2
comforting his wife and holding both her hands tightly , mr @entity30 , 63 , then turned his head and glared for several seconds towards the dock , where his daughter 's killer , @entity5 , sat facing the floor with his hands clasped over his head			1
the jury was told that 33 - year - old @entity39 could have placed miss @entity1 's body inside a cover sheet he used to protect his bicycle before she was bundled into the boot of his car			1
lawyers for the defence suggested that traces of his dna found on his victim ’s breasts and jeans could have come from this ‘ bicycle bag ’			0
the same post-mortem examination images seen by @entity30 and mrs @entity1 had caused @entity39 , who admits manslaughter but denies murder , to cry when they were first shown to the jury last week			1
the pictures were displayed during evidence from a forensic scientist who had examined blood stains found on a wall next to the country road where miss @entity1 ’s snow - covered body was found on christmas morning last year			0
witness : chaplain @entity67 , left , leaves court after giving evidence for the trial of @entity5 , right the expert said the blood pattern indicated smearing rather than spattering , meaning it was unlikely that @entity30 had been assaulted at the spot on @entity74 in @entity75 , near @entity3			1
@entity76 told the jury : ‘ the presence of the blood on the top of the wall may indicate an attempt was made to deposit the body over the top of the wall			1
’ the court also heard that when @entity39 was arrested a month after his next - door neighbour @entity30 was announced missing , he appeared ‘ shaky ’ after the police ’s early - morning arrival at the friend ’s flat where he and his girlfriend were temporarily staying a couple of miles away			1
in the police station later on , the jury heard , two small wounds were seen on his left arm			0
@entity39 , who had been under 24 - hour supervision at @entity100 , was said to have told mr @entity67 of his plan to plead guilty three weeks after his arrest an artist 's impression of @entity105 giving evidence yesterday in the ongoing trial of @entity5 pictured with his head in his hands the 6ft 4in @entity110 told a custody nurse he had been taking sleeping pills and drinking more in the weeks after miss @entity1 died ‘ to help him relax ’			1
he was later interviewed several times by detectives , who questioned him about his activities on the night miss @entity1 was killed			0
the court heard that @entity39 refused to comment when police asked him a series of questions , including whether miss @entity1 had invited him into her flat in the @entity123 area of @entity3 , if he made sexual advances to her and if he had been inside her bedroom			1
the jury was also told that the @entity110 engineer claimed to police he had gone to take pictures of @entity123 in the snow on december 17 , before returning home and visiting a nearby @entity131 because ‘ he liked to be in large supermarkets at night ’			1
testimony : miss @entity1 ' bereaved boyfriend @entity105 walks into court yesterday the defendant said he had brought his car into the drive during the evening to defrost it and get it ready to collect his girlfriend from her work @entity141			0
he also said he had slipped over on the pathway to his flat – but did not mention having any contact with miss @entity1			0
@entity39 is said to have ‘ squeezed the life ’ out of his neighbour in a ‘ desperate ’ struggle at her flat just minutes after she arrived home alone , while her boyfriend @entity105 was away			1
@entity151 : @entity5 , seen here in newly released footage , visited @entity154 at 8.10pm on the night of her death final sighting : @entity157 in a @entity3 branch of @entity159 after leaving colleagues in a nearby pub to walk home on december 17 last year he is alleged to have driven with the body in the boot of his car to @entity131 , where he bought beer , rock salt and crisps			0
miss @entity1 sustained 43 separate injuries before being dumped in the snow			0
a couple walking their dog found her body , partially clothed , 100 yards down the lane , on christmas day morning			0
the trial at @entity3 continues			0
tribute : mr and mrs @entity1 lay flowers at the spot where their daughter 's body was found on @entity141			2
