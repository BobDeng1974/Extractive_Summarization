in less than a month , @entity0 will decide whether to become an independent country or remain part of the @entity3			1
uncertainty regarding the future normally slows down property markets , but in @entity0 the reverse has been true			1
data from estate agent @entity9 show that in the second quarter of this year , median house prices rose by eight per cent – almost double the figure for @entity14 and @entity15			1
and the market in @entity0 ’s capital has been particularly buoyant – for example , in the three months to april , the number of homes sold in @entity18 was 40 per cent up on the same period in 2013			1
popular area : a four - bed house in @entity18 's @entity24 recently sold for £ 1.17million in @entity0 , vendors of residential property are required to provide a @entity27 , which includes a professional survey and a mortgage valuation , and buyers submit sealed bids for the property			1
‘ a year ago , fewer than one in four homes sold in @entity18 achieved their valuation , ’ says @entity33 , business development analyst at the @entity34			1
‘ today , for the first time in four years , over half the homes sold in the capital achieve their valuation and one in 20 will exceed the valuation by ten per cent or more			2
’ while there is not a property bubble comparable to the one seen recently in @entity44 , @entity18 did not suffer the negative equity experienced elsewhere when the market crashed during the banking crisis			1
‘ the market here merely plateaued , ’ says @entity48 , senior partner in the property division of @entity50 in @entity18			1
selling well : a six - bed home on @entity54 in @entity24 , @entity18 , similar to the one pictured above , is currently on sale at £ 1.55million uncertainty regarding the future normally slows down property markets , but in @entity0 , and particularly in @entity18 , the reverse has been true this is hardly surprising			1
@entity18 is one of those places with a market that runs its own course , to some extent independent of the winds of change			1
in part , this is due to the foresight of the city elders in the 1760s who organised an architectural competition to develop the north of the city , partly to relieve the overcrowded medieval @entity75 and partly to attract the wealthy			2
the resultant @entity24 was built in stages up to the 1830s			1
it was the largest planned city of its time , with its grid of broad streets , elegant squares and neo-classical sandstone buildings			2
now part of a @entity86 , the @entity24 , with adjacent @entity87 , is the most sought - after sector for city living			1
on average , a three - bedroom flat here costs between £ 600,000 and £ 700,000			2
‘ there is always strong demand from well - to - do professional couples and families , ’ @entity48 says			2
‘ but the market for £ 1 million - plus properties is limited			0
’ changing @entity18 : @entity98 has been renovating properties for 15 years one @entity18 property for sale that has recently received a lot of interest is 13 @entity103 , an elegant , listed terrace house on the eastern edge of the @entity24 with four bedrooms and two reception rooms			1
it was designed by architect @entity109 in 1823 and is currently on sale through @entity50			0
the minimum price for offers has been set at £ 850,000 , but the house is expected to fetch more than £ 1 million			0
formerly architects ’ offices , it was bought last november for £ 710,000 by a foreign - based owner , who handed over its renovation to @entity98 , 42 , co-director of project management business @entity120			0
‘ there was everything to do , from listed building consent for even the most minor alteration to replumbing , rewiring and choosing all the designs and finishes , ’ says @entity98 , who met her @entity123 business partner , @entity122 , when they were members of the @entity3 @entity125			0
‘ there ’s been a great deal of interest , mainly from expat families returning to @entity18 , ’ says @entity98 , who has been renovating properties for 15 years			2
she started the business in her spare time while working for @entity141 , where she ended up as a detective inspector in counter-terrorism			0
@entity146 , on the other side of the @entity145 , is also desirable , as is leafy @entity147 , south of the centre , with large family houses			0
@entity48 says he recently sold a villa there valued at £ 800,000 for £ 910,000			0
in april next year , stamp duty in @entity0 will be replaced by the @entity154 – which may well prove popular as it will be on a sliding scale rather than kicking in at certain rates at certain levels			2
but how will the market fare come the referendum ? @entity33 expects the market to slow just beforehand			0
‘ in uncertain times , people delay major decisions , ’ he says			0
‘ but whichever way it goes , we ’re not going to see a flood of properties on the market			0
’ @entity48 adds : ‘ currently , the economic recovery has overridden concerns about the referendum			0
but if the result is no , we could see the market climb away			0
if it ’s a @entity176 , well , it ’s anybody ’s guess			0

median house prices in @entity0 rose by eight per cent last quarter
@entity24 is the most sought - after sector for city living in @entity18
experts say the future is uncertain is @entity0 vote yes in referendum
