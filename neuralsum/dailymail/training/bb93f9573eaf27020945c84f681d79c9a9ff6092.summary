an eight - year - old boy who was told he could have life - changing surgery to allow him to finally play football with his friends , has had the opportunity snatched away because of an ‘ @entity6 shake - up ’			1
@entity7 suffers from spastic diplegia , a form of cerebral palsy which affects his lower limbs and means he has to rely on a wheelchair			1
but he was given hope after being offered pioneering surgery - called @entity14 - on the @entity6			1
@entity16 ( with his mother @entity17 ) has spastic diplegia , a form of cerebral palsy which affects his lower limbs			1
he was told he could have surgery on the @entity6 but then got a letter saying the operation had been cancelled the operation would involve cutting the nerves in his spine to relieve the severe tightness in his legs			1
the procedure , which was only previously offered in the @entity29 , became available at @entity7 ’s local hospital , the @entity31			1
@entity7 ’s mother @entity32 , 36 , said : ‘ we were delighted			2
‘ we were starting to think about raising more than £ 50,000 to get to @entity29 to let him have the operation and then it became available just down the road			2
‘ we just could n’t believe our luck			0
’ but after assessments and consultations in which doctors helped @entity7 plan for his upcoming surgery , his hopes were promptly shattered by a letter delivered to his home in @entity50 , @entity51			1
as a result , @entity7 's family ( parents @entity52 and @entity17 , and sister , @entity54 ) were left with no choice but to try and raise the £ 20,000 needed for the surgery themselves the @entity59 , who had organised the operation , was abolished and @entity62 who took over shattered the hopes of @entity7 , and five other children , by cancelling their operations			1
mrs @entity32 said : ‘ one minute they were booking him in for the operation and @entity7 was looking forward to being just like his friends , and the next a bog standard letter came through the door saying it had been cancelled			1
‘ he was really upset , and it was heart - breaking to see			0
‘ he thought he had everything coming to him and it was taken away from him in a heartbeat			0
‘ we are desperately trying to raise the money so he can have the operation before his ninth birthday			2
’ @entity7 's story appeared on @entity82 on monday , at which point the family had raised half of the target			2
donations flooded in from generous readers and by wednesday they had reached the target the operation is now only available to @entity7 if his family stumps up a staggering £ 20,000 for the crucial surgery , as well as paying further bills for his post-operative treatment			1
they must try and raise the money in less than six months , as it is necessary for @entity7 to have the surgery before his birthday in january , while he is still young enough to benefit			1
@entity7 was born prematurely at 34 weeks by emergency caesarean when his mother could no longer feel him moving			2
at six - weeks - old , his parents were told he had suffered brain damage due to a lack of oxygen and he was later diagnosed with spastic diplegia			1
@entity16 needs to have the surgery before his ninth birthday in january or he will be too old to get the full benefits			0
he hopes he will eventually be able to play football with his friends he has a walker to help him get around but he struggles with it , and needs a lot of physiotherapy to keep his muscles as loose as possible			0
mrs @entity32 said : ‘ he loves watching football but he ca n’t run around and play football with his friends			0
‘ he ’s getting to the age where he ’s starting to notice he ’s different			0
he does n’t like sports day because he ca n’t compete properly to win anything and he feels left out when he does n’t get picked for things			0
’ the surgery would mean @entity7 could finally have complete movement in his legs			1
up until hearing about the surgery , families around the world have travelled to @entity130 in @entity29 where experts routinely carry out the operation			2
‘ trying to raise over £ 50,000 seemed like a very hard feat , and although £ 20,000 is obviously a big snip , it ’s still a hard task , ’ said mrs @entity32			1
‘ we ’re doing everything we can , and @entity7 is brilliant at thinking up fundraising ideas			2
he is having a game - athon soon to try and raise money			0
‘ we just want him to be able to run around with his friends and not feel like he is being held back			0
’ a spokeswoman for @entity62 said they did not discuss individual cases but added : ‘ @entity62 ’s current commissioning policy means that this procedure is not currently being routinely funded for patients in @entity62			0
‘ individual funding requests will continue to be considered where there are believed to be exceptional clinical grounds in an individual case			0
’ she said that @entity6 funding may be provided later this financial year for a small group of patients to evaluate the effectiveness of the treatment			0
@entity7 and his family can be supported in their fundraising at @entity159 @entity14 is a neurosurgical technique used to treat spasticity ( increased muscle tone ) in the lower limbs			1
the lower vertebrae are opened to reveal the spinal cord which contains the neurones of the central nervous system			0
these neurones ( bundles of nerve fibres ) channel messages between the brain and different areas of the body			0
electrical stimulation is used to identify and sub-divide sensory and motor nerves			0
this process continues until the specific nerves and nerve roots affecting the spastic muscles are identified and cut			0
due to the size of the nerves and rootlets , this is a very precise procedure and therefore the surgery can last several hours and requires a general anaesthetic			1
many months of physiotherapy are needed after the surgery to retrain the legs			2

@entity7 has spastic diplegia , cerebral palsy that affects the legs
he is totally *dependent* upon a wheelchair and a walking frame
he was told he could have a @entity14 procedure , which involves cutting the nerves in his spine that cause tightness in his legs
but his family were then sent a letter saying that due to an ' @entity6 shake - up ' , his surgery had been cancelled
his family now has to raise £ 20,000 in six months to pay for the operation
