the ' biggest national security threat ' to the @entity1 at this juncture is not terrorists abroad , says former defense secretary @entity4 , it 's @entity5			1
' it 's the total dysfunction in @entity7			1
the fact that so little can be done by the @entity5 , ' @entity4 told @entity10 's @entity9 on sunday during an appearance on @entity12			1
earlier in the broadcast @entity4 , the @entity14 chief from 2011 to 2013 , said @entity15 ' truly represents kind of a whole new face in the war on terrorism ' because the extremist group is well - funded , well - armed and ' has a strong command and control			1
' ' and as a result of that , i think that they can conduct the kind of offensive operations that can be very effective , ' he said , and therefore they must ' be met tooth and nail with everything we 've got			1
' the @entity1 needs to bolster its strategy in confronting @entity15 if it is going to achieve its mission of degrading and destroying the terror group , former defense secretary @entity4 said on sunday @entity15 , @entity4 told @entity10 's @entity9 , ' is a whole new chapter in terms of the terrorist threat to that area and to our country			1
' but the ' biggest ' threat to @entity1 national security is the dysfunction of @entity5 , he said @entity15 , he proclaimed , ' is a whole new chapter in terms of the terrorist threat to that area and to our country			2
' @entity4 said president @entity51 has the ' right pieces in place to try to confront @entity15 ' and noted that the @entity1 and its partners have ' made some important gains ' in stopping the territorial expansion of militants in @entity58			2
but even after prompting from fill - in host @entity9 , @entity4 would not say he agreed with @entity51 's claim last week that the @entity1 ' coalition ' is on the offensive ' and @entity15 ' is on the defensive			1
' the president 's ' strategy has to be bolstered in a strong way , ' he asserted			0
' we 've got to be able to ensure that we are committed every day of the week towards making sure that this strategy works , that we disrupt , dismantle and ultimately defeat @entity15			2
' @entity4 acknowledged , as he did in his memoir , released in october of last year , that @entity51 and his administration bungled its response to the chaos in @entity72 and that the @entity73 should have asked @entity5 for the authority to fight @entity15 at least six months before it did			1
the @entity1 has been carrying out airstrikes on @entity15 in @entity58 since august , @entity72 since september , but it did not make a formal request to @entity5 for power to go to war with the terrorist group and its affiliates until last week			2
the @entity73 has been relying on a 9/11 era document for its authority to carry out military operations in the two countries			0
it last week asked @entity5 to tear up a 2001 authorization of @entity86 and replace it was an updated ' right - sized ' resolution giving the president the ability to conduct an air and ground war against @entity15 in any country it invades			2
despite its close work with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle to come up with a draft that satisfied both political parties , legislators are dissatisfied with the president 's request for varying reasons			0
they have suggested they would not support the proposed @entity104 in its current form			0
in this photo taken last wednesday , president @entity51 ( center ) delivers a statement on the legislation he sent to @entity5 earlier in the day to authorize the use of military force ( @entity104 ) against @entity15 , while vice president @entity112 ( left ) and secretary of state @entity113 ( second right ) and then - secretary of defense @entity114 ( right ) listen			1
the following day @entity115 was confirmed by the @entity116 as @entity14 head , replacing @entity118 @entity4 lashed out at @entity5 on sunday for @entity120 ' unwillingness to put aside their differences to pass legislation addressing key problems			2
they ca n't ' resolve the issue of homeland security			0
they ca n't deal with budgets			0
they ca n't deal with immigration reform			0
they ca n't deal with infrastructure			0
they ca n't deal with other issues , ' he said , referencing a dispute over funding for @entity138 that must end by feb. 28 to avoid a partial shutdown of the department			0
' if they wind up not being able to deal with this war authorization , that sends a terrible message to the world , ' @entity4 warned			2
the former defense head and @entity148 director stressed that @entity15 ' is not an enemy that you can kind of stand aside and not confront			1
' ' if we stand aside , if we do n't get involved , if we do n't provide leadership , unfortunately , nobody else will , ' he claimed			1
' that 's why it 's important for us to take a leadership position ' in @entity58 , @entity72 and ' elsewhere in confronting terrorism , ' he said			0
@entity4 said he had ' tremendous confidence ' in newly confirmed secretary of defense @entity115 's skill set and ability to steer the president toward victory in the country 's battle against @entity15			1
' he 's very bright , ' @entity4 said			0
noting that @entity115 served as his no. 2 at the @entity14 , @entity4 said the new military chief knows the @entity14 inside out			0
but ' in the end , it 's the president who has to ultimately decide ' whether to take the advice of his top military advisers , he said , or not .			0

' it 's the total dysfunction in @entity7 . the fact that so little can be done by the @entity5 , ' @entity4 said during an appearance on @entity12
he said @entity15 ' truly represents kind of a whole new face in the war on terrorism ' ; they must ' be met tooth and nail with everything we 've got '
' if we stand aside , if we do n't get involved , if we do n't provide leadership , unfortunately , nobody else will , ' he claimed
