women 's colleges across the @entity2 are revisiting policies around enrolling transgender students as institutions of higher learning — single - sex , coed and those with religious affiliations — demonstrate varying degrees of acceptance for changing norms			1
@entity13 in @entity14 , @entity15 , recently became the first women 's college in the @entity2 to declare it would accept undergraduate applications from ' self - identified women ' and people ' assigned female at birth who do not fit into the gender binary , ' effective the semester that starts january 2015			1
@entity26 in @entity27 , @entity28 , followed with a similar announcement last week			0
administrators at other prominent women 's colleges also are weighing changes			1
as thoughts of gender are evolving , @entity2 colleges are revisiting their enrollment policies ( stock image ) the discussions are , in part , an acknowledgment that thoughts on gender are evolving			1
student activists have been steadily pushing for colleges to make changes , and some schools have altered applications to allow applicants to select ' transgender ' as a third option for gender or given them the option to discuss their gender identity in a short essay			2
' what it means to be a woman is n't static , ' says @entity59 president @entity58 , who announced the admissions policy change at the college 's convocation ceremony			2
' early feminists argued that reducing women to their biological functions was a foundation of women 's oppression			1
we do n't want to fall back on that			0
' other institutions , however , want to place limits on those students once they arrive on campus , including what sports they can play , which bathrooms they can use and where they can live			1
@entity81 , @entity79 and @entity80 are among the @entity83 colleges that have recently sought and received a religious exemption from @entity85 , the federal law banning gender - based discrimination in education			2
@entity58 says her college 's decision represents a counterpoint of sorts to those actions			2
' it 's part of a national conversation , ' she said			2
' when you have @entity98 with ( transgender actress ) @entity99 on the cover and the @entity101 running articles on transgender issues almost every week , it 's part of mainstream discourse			2
' but even within @entity59 's extended community , the policy shifts have not been fully embraced			0
some alumnae voiced their displeasure on the college 's @entity111 page following the announcement			2
' @entity59 is a women 's college , and it should admit women			1
full stop , ' wrote @entity117 , a @entity118 , @entity119 , resident who graduated from @entity59 in 1979			0
@entity120 a women 's college in western @entity28 , @entity120 recently said it is excluding financial aid documents from the list of materials it uses to affirm an applicant 's gender identity			1
now , only the application and official supporting documents are part of that review			0
officials say they are weighing further changes			0
@entity120 alumni include @entity136 and two recent first ladies			0
@entity138 @entity138 , a women 's college outside @entity140 whose alumni include @entity143 , says it will hold lectures , discussions and presentations this academic year on ' what it means to be a women 's college at a time when definitions of gender are expanding			1
' @entity152 @entity152 , in @entity153 , says it will hold similar campus conversations about transgender students at women 's colleges			1
officials say that in the meantime it , like some other women 's colleges , will be reviewing transgender applications on a case - by - case basis			1
@entity167 @entity168 's @entity167 has added an options question to its application meant to encourage applicants — in up to 250 words — to discuss their sexual orientation or gender identity			0
@entity175 @entity176 allows applicants to select ' transgender ' as a third option in its gender question			0
it also asks an optional question about sexual orientation			0
in a follow up email , she said : ' there are plenty of other places for people who are not women to go , and they should go there			0
do n't negate the reasons @entity59 was founded and for what it has been known since 1837 : providing a superlative college education — for women			2
' @entity58 acknowledged the detractors , but she said current students have been overwhelmingly supportive			0
@entity198 , a female senior and an organizer for @entity200 , a student group that had helped push for the admissions policy change , says she does n't believe excluding trans women from admission fits with @entity59 's mission			2
@entity207 , president of the @entity208 , said she expects many of the 47 women 's colleges in the @entity2 and @entity211 will eventually develop formal admission policies on transgender students			1
she dismissed the notion that such policies dilute the mission of women 's colleges , many of which were founded at a time when higher learning institutions were largely closed to women			1
' this is consistent with women 's colleges ' missions and historic willingness to address issues of diversity , inclusion and social justice , ' @entity224 said			1
transgender student activists are elated by the developments , which they say are long overdue			0
at the same time , they acknowledge there are bigger hurdles for their community overcome			0
' we must be wary of policies being thought of as actual change , ' says @entity242 , a transgender female at @entity244 in @entity245 , @entity15 , who says she might have considered applying to a women 's college had the admissions changes happened earlier			1
' no policy will change transphobic attitudes			0
' @entity250 , a transgender female who garnered national headlines last year when she disclosed that @entity120 had refused to review her application , says the debate over women 's college admissions , if nothing else , can help highlight the myriad challenges transgender people face			1
' hopefully this leads to changes in attitudes in general , ' said the @entity263 sophomore			0
' so that more people realize we do face employment discrimination and that we do have issues with legal representation and health care coverage			0

@entity13 in @entity14 , @entity15 , became the first women 's college in the @entity2 to accept undergrad applications from ' self - identified women '
some institutions want to place limits , including what sports they can play , which bathrooms they can use and where they can live
