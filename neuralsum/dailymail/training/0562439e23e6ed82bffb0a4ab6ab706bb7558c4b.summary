' determined to change her ways , in january 2013 she decided to try a meal replacement programme which limits your daily calorie intake to just 500 calories each day			1
' i knew i had to do something about my weight , ' she explained			0
@entity37 , nutritionist says : ' the diets are monitored and so are considered safe for that reason			0
' but very low calorie diets are not to be undertaken in the long term without supervision and also , importantly , clearance from your gp			0
' it 's what you eat after the diet has finished that 's vital and i recommend seeing a nutrition professional afterwards to learn how to eat , not how to diet			2
' ' i was absolutely massive and i was terrified i would have a heart attack			0
' not to mention how awful i looked in photographs next to my slim friends			0
' i was so jealous of all the fashionable clothes they got to wear , while i was stuck in frumpy t - shirts and baggy trousers			0
' after sticking to the plan for a year , @entity8 has shed 12 stone and gone from a size 28 to a trim size 12 in time for @entity19			1
' this year there will be no hiding at @entity19 parties for me , ' said proud @entity8			1

when she was in her teens she was a size 16 , then in 2007 after having her daughter @entity83 , now six , she piled on more pounds			2
this year she will be rewarded for her efforts and hosting her own @entity7 as a svelte size 12 she quit her job working in an office to become a full - time mother , but would spend her days sat on the sofa gorging on greasy take - aways , fatty chocolates and salty crisps			1
unsurprisingly , her 5000 calorie - a - day diet saw her weight balloon from 15 stone and a size 16 , to a massive 21 stone and a size 28			1
@entity8 says : ' it was disgusting how large i got , and i was no role model for my little girl			2
