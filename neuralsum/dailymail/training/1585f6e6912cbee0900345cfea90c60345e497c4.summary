so much golf history has been written at @entity1 it seems only appropriate that a landmark day for the @entity4 game has now moved firmly into view			0
if @entity7 can keep mind and sinew together in the final round of the 143rd @entity10 , he will become the first player from this continent to win three different majors since the @entity14 was founded in 1934			1
even the greats like sir @entity16 and @entity17 only won two of the four , so to add the @entity19 to the @entity20 he won in 2011 and the @entity21 the following year would be truly impressive			0
he would then have the chance to complete the career @entity25 - something only five golfers have achieved - at the masters next year at the age of just 25			0
' that would put me in really illustrious company			0
but i 'm taking nothing for granted			0
i came from seven back myself with a round to go to win the @entity45 at @entity46 this year , so i know it can be done , and i can not afford to get ahead of myself			0
' just like @entity30 before him , @entity7 is so good that when he plays his best , the rest are playing for second place			1
it was here in 2006 that @entity30 underlined that point and now @entity7 has the chance to put the finishing touches to what has been a 54 - hole masterclass in all aspects of his craft			1
the fact it has been delivered on a links course only adds to the achievement			0
remember @entity7 's frustrated words after being blown away at @entity63 's in 2011 , or being demoralised at @entity64 last year ? the previous best @entity7 had ever managed going into the final round of an @entity20 was nine shots behind			1
here , after adding a 68 to his two opening rounds of 66 , he will begin with a mammoth six - stroke advantage			0
fans ' favourite : @entity7 makes his way to the 18th before finishing with a magnificent eagle three the @entity74 has shown emphatically what he has learned regarding this form of the game , and while he undoubtedly got lucky with the draw over the first two rounds , you still have to possess the shots to be able to take advantage			1
mental strength never used to be one of his best qualities but the manner in which he lengthened his stride over the closing holes , after @entity88 had caught him at one point , was positively @entity30 - like			1
indeed , @entity30 comparisons abound , and there 's no greater compliment than that			0
only two men have won three majors at a younger age than @entity7 since the @entity14 was founded in 1934 , and they just happen to be @entity30 and @entity97			1
only @entity30 has ever won three majors by seven shots or more but , having won his first two by eight , that 's certainly within @entity7 's compass			1
like all the great ones he saved the best for last , and a towering drive and five - iron to the par - five 18th that finished just 11 feet from the hole			2
that second shot from 237 yards was as pure a golf shot as you will ever see and when he duly rolled in the putt , it meant he had played the last five holes in the following : birdie - par - eagle - bogey - eagle			1
he is now 11 under for the par fives alone			2
contender : @entity113 @entity88 is six shots adrift of @entity7 weather warning : electrical storms were forecast for saturday afternoon but they never materialised he 's not quite home and dry yet , as he said			1
@entity119 once lost a six - shot final - round lead at the masters and @entity7 lost one of four strokes there himself			1
@entity88 began six in arrears yesterday and caught him after 13 holes			1
so he will have plenty of reference points today to remind him that the job is not done			0
all the thousands of brave souls who donned their waterproofs and ignored the terrible weather forecast were regally rewarded , for this was a fantastic day 's play			0
thankfully , the bad stuff stayed away until just after the final putt dropped and a scoring festival broke out			0
the nightmare scenario when you 're owning a four - stroke halfway lead is a rain - sodden links , no wind , and a host of aggressive shotmakers in the rear - view mirror			0
for a while it was @entity150 and @entity151 who took dead aim to make inroads into @entity7 's lead			1
then came a foe who threatened to become a familiar one when he defeated @entity157 for the @entity158 three years ago with a birdie at the first play - off hole to claim his maiden @entity162 title			0
@entity88 disappeared thereafter but a rebuilt swing under the wise tutelage of @entity165 looks to be paying dividends			1
the putter , though , remains his most potent weapon , and he wielded it to such deadly effect he achieved parity with @entity7 at the 13th			2
hats off : could @entity150 mount a challenge on the final day at @entity174 ? struggle : @entity30 , the 14 - time major champion shot a 73 to sit three over and in 58th place the problem with gunslingers , however , is they 're prone to shoot themselves in the foot			1
@entity151 did it with three successive bogeys to close the front nine			0
@entity150 missed a tiddler that stalled his momentum			2
as for @entity88 , having climbed level with @entity7 , he promptly bogeyed three of his next four holes			1
@entity7 began tentatively with a bogey from the middle of the first fairway , but this is where experi - ence kicks in			2
he would have known that after two wonderful 66s it was almost inevitable things would n't go quite so smoothly for a third successive day			0
' even when @entity88 drew level i remained comfortable , ' he said			2
' i knew i had to be patient and there were some holes coming up where i could take advantage			0
' everything changed as @entity88 's rough patch coincided with inspired golf from @entity7			1
it was a 30 - foot birdie putt at the 14th , one of the tough par fours on the back nine , that got him going			2
at the 16th there was a three - shot swing , as @entity7 found the green in two and rolled in another long one , while @entity88 was running up an untidy bogey			1
as he came down the 18th the 7,000 spectators sitting in the first wraparound stand in @entity20 history rose to acclaim @entity4 's history man ( @entity217 - born @entity216 won three different majors in 1927 - 31 , but had become an @entity113 citizen when he won them )			2
' i wanted to give them something to cheer , because it 's a pleasure to play in front of people who are giving you so much support , ' he said , and he delivered			0
and so one of the great achievements in the annals of the @entity4 game has moved within touching distance			0
on the banks of the @entity234 , on an afternoon of promised sunshine , it looks like we 're about to see thrilling confirmation that @entity7 is fit to rank alongside any contemporary you care to mention as the leading sportsman of his time .			2

@entity7 carded two eagles and a birdie in his final three holes at @entity174
@entity74 is now 16 under par for the *tournament*
