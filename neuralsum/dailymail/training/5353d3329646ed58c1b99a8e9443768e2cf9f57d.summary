by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 13:26 est , 2 march 2014 updated : 13:50 est , 2 march 2014 should @entity3 remain in charge of @entity5 ? @entity6 feels under - fire @entity5 manager @entity3 owes a debt of gratitude to @entity11 midfielder @entity10 for turning the other cheek in saturday 's headbutt horror at @entity14			1
the @entity16 boss hailed @entity10 's responsible reaction to the weekend 's biggest talking point			2
' a lot of players may have reacted differently to @entity10 , that 's what i think			2
i think @entity3 will be pleased that it was @entity10 that he was dealing with , ' said @entity6			1
other players may have gone down			0
' his own club manager @entity25 ( @entity41 ) made reference to that			0
' i know @entity10 and i think overall he did very , very well , ' he added			2
pressed for his personal view on @entity3 's actions , @entity6 said : ' i think if you do n't mind i 'll probably steer clear of that			1
' it did n't look good			0
' @entity10 , who played for the @entity16 boss at @entity50 , is not the sort of character to allow saturday 's incident affect him , according to @entity6			1
' i do n't think that sort of thing will bother him			0
it does n't seem as if he has stepped out of line in any way , not at all , ' he said			0
@entity3 was left clinging to his job as @entity5 manager after the club fined him £ 100,000 and reprimanded him for the headbutt during an astonishing touchline bust - up			1
clash : @entity3 reacted in unprecedented fashion to being barged by the @entity67 international scuffle : the incident started after @entity10 pushed @entity3 out of the way with the ball rolling towards him @entity5 are disappointed with the actions of its manager @entity3 this afternoon ( saturday , 1st march )			1
his behaviour was unacceptable and is not the behaviour we expect from the manager of @entity5			2
it is most disappointing that this incident has taken the focus away from what was a fantastic performance by the team and an excellent result away from home which leaves the club in eighth place in the @entity87			0
sadly , the headlines tomorrow will not be focused on the result or the efforts of the players , but instead on the actions of our manager			0
@entity3 unreservedly apologised immediately following the game to the player , to @entity14 and its fans , and to the fans of @entity5			1
we have held discussions this evening with @entity3 who has offered his sincere apologies to the @entity14 and it is clear he deeply regrets his actions			1
@entity3 has accepted a formal warning from the @entity14 in relation to his behaviour today and also a @entity14 fine of £ 100,000			1
@entity107 is now drawing a line under this matter and will be making no further comment			0
the @entity5 manager was ordered to the stands in disgrace by referee @entity114			2
then , after his side ’s 4 - 1 victory , @entity3 expressed his regret and said sorry for his actions			2
hours later he was fined £ 100,000 by his club and formally reprimanded for ‘ unacceptable behaviour ’			1
but two of @entity5 ’s past heroes , striker @entity121 and ex-manager @entity122 , publicly branded @entity3 ’s position at the club untenable and insisted @entity5 owner @entity125 had every right to tear up the 52 - year - old ’s contract , which has six years to run			1
while his team celebrated victory , @entity3 , who has a history of touchline confrontations with opposition managers , said : ‘ i tried to ease him [ @entity10 ] away and i put my head in a forward motion			1
you just ca n’t do that			0
i apologised to him , to everyone at @entity14 and in particular to my own fans			2
‘ it was a heat - of - the - moment thing			1
i just wanted to get the guy away from me but it was a forward motion and you ca n’t do that			0
i am not stupid enough to think there ’s going to be no punishment			0
i just have to accept it			0
’ that punishment is almost certain to be considerable			0
the @entity149 are taking the incident very seriously and @entity3 faces a significant ban — quite possibly to the end of the season			1
off you go : @entity3 is sent to the stands by referee @entity114 opinionated : @entity121 , who managed @entity5 in 2009 , slammed @entity3 for his headbutt bittersweet : @entity122 also laid into @entity3 for his actions as @entity5 ran out 4 - 1 winners from above : @entity3 ( centre ) looks on from the stands as @entity5 secured a 4 - 1 win @entity163 's @entity162 calls @entity3 foolish for his headbutt on @entity10 , but insists more needs to be done about the referee 's control in the technical area			1
click here to read more @entity149 chairman @entity170 said : ‘ it looks serious and we will investigate			2
’ @entity121 , who played more than 300 times for @entity5 , called @entity3 ’s position at the club untenable			1
‘ what on earth can @entity3 say to his players when they misbehave ? ’ added @entity121			0
‘ i have never seen anything like that before , ever			0
‘ frankly i would n’t be surprised , and i do n’t think anybody will be surprised at all , if @entity3 were to resign over this			0
‘ even if he does n’t want to resign , the club might be saying to him , “ we might be doing you a favour — you resign rather than us sack you ” , because that will have to be in his thinking also			0
’ @entity122 added : ‘ that is a sackable offence			0
i ’ve been frustrated and upset by a number of things , but i ’ve never gone down that road			0
' november 2006 : @entity3 had earlier in the year criticised @entity194 boss @entity193 for failing to field an @entity196 player in the @entity198 match against @entity199 and matters came to a head in @entity203 's 1 - 0 win over @entity194			1
then @entity203 boss @entity3 's enthusiastic celebrations appeared to irritate @entity193 , who claimed he was ' provoked in a disrespectful way ' , with the pair having to be kept apart by the fourth official			2
on this occasion , it was the @entity210 boss who was fined by the @entity149 , with @entity3 cleared of all charges			1
march 2012 : in a @entity214 , it perhaps comes as no surprise that the tension boiled over , with @entity3 , now @entity5 boss , clashing with @entity6 following his celebration to @entity219 's late equaliser in a heated match			1
both managers pledged afterwards to keep their emotions in check in future			0
august 2012 : @entity3 came under severe criticism and then afterwards labelled his behaviour ' ridiculous ' when he shoved linesman @entity228 in the @entity230 ' season opener against @entity231 after disagreeing with the official 's decision to award @entity231 a throw - in			2
@entity3 once again apologised for his actions but the @entity149 took a dim view and hit him with a two - match touchline ban and a £ 20,000 fine			1
january 2014 : @entity3 became involved in another touchline row , less than a month after having heated words with @entity242 boss @entity241 , with @entity244 manager @entity243			0
television cameras clearly showed the @entity5 boss launching an expletive - laden volley at the @entity248			2
@entity3 was spared punishment but said later : ' it was a heat of the moment thing , words we always have as managers , to a degree			1
i 've apologised and i 'm fortunate that he 's accepted that			0

@entity3 fined £ 100,000 by @entity5 after headbutting @entity14 's @entity10
the 52 - year - old was sent to the stands and faces an @entity149 charge
