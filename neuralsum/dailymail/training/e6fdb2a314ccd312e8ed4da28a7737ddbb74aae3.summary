by @entity0 published : 10:56 est , 26 march 2013 updated : 02:35 est , 27 march 2013 award - winning @entity2 director @entity1 has received critical acclaim for his numerous hit films including @entity5			1
but the multi-talented director is also a passionate deep sea explorer who last year became the first person to descend to the deepest place in the ocean alone			2
he is now donating the submarine - called the @entity12 - he used for the trip to the @entity15 in @entity16 for scientific research			1
scroll down to watch the video @entity1 's dive took him to a part of the ocean no one has visited for 50 years - and he is the only human being to have travelled and returned solo gift : @entity1 pictured emerging from the hatch of @entity12 which he has now donated to the @entity15 in @entity16 @entity1 became the first to descend the 10.9km - almost seven miles - down into the @entity27 in the western @entity28 , for 50 years - and the only person to have ever done it alone			1
but he is now donating the submarine he used to achieve the incredible feat as he says cuts to funding for deep sea exploration is jeopardising research			1
the submarine parts will be used as add - ons for other vessels but the @entity12 could dive again in the future			1
@entity1 told the @entity41 : ' i 'd love to keep the @entity12 continuously operational			1
but i think that what i 'm going for right now is what i call " potentially operational "			0
' my hope is with the sub 's home now at @entity49 , there will be a residential team in place - and they will have the knowledge of how to bring that sub back online			0
' explorer : the @entity12 , pictured being tested off the coast of @entity56 , descended 35,756 feet to the @entity28 seafloor record - breaking : @entity1 became the first to descend almost seven miles down into the @entity27 in the western @entity28 for 50 years and if it does come back in service , @entity1 will the first queuing up to get behind the controls			1
he added : ' i 'd like to go dive the sub again			0
there are a number of really , really interesting science targets out there			0
i would love to see the @entity12 dive in the @entity68 , the @entity69 and the @entity70 ( a 10.7km - deep part of the @entity27 )			1
' when @entity1 travelled to the @entity27 , it took him two hours to reach the seafloor			1
he then spent several hours exploring the seafloor while @entity75 cameras captured images for a @entity78 film being released later this year			0
speaking after the dive , @entity1 said he had hoped to see some strange deep sea monster like a creature that would excite the storyteller in him and seem like out of his movies , but he did n't			2
all he saw were voracious shrimp - like critters that were n't bigger than an inch			0
@entity1 was the first person to ever make the descent alone and spent several hours exploring the sea floor protection : @entity1 commanded the sub from a spherical cockpit - the best shape for withstanding pressure he said : ' it was bleak			1
it looked like the moon			0
i did n’t see a fish			0
i did n’t see anything that looked alive to me , other than a few shrimplike amphipods in the water			0
' the only previous manned dive to the @entity27 was carried out by @entity104 lt @entity103 and @entity106 oceanographer @entity105 in a bathyscaphe called @entity108 in 1960			2
a series of dives - including @entity1 's - in the last year have helped discover several new species			2
the director told @entity113 : ' as an absolute minimum , ( there were ) over 68 new species - most are bacteria , some are amphipods , and there is possibly a new sea cucumber ... and that number may go way up			0
' there were also some quite interesting new species of giant amphipods that were 7 - 8in long when amphipods are normally 0.5 - 1in in size			0
' swinging above the docks in @entity130 's @entity129 is the @entity108 , the submersible that took @entity103 and @entity105 on the first and only successful manned dive to the bottom of the @entity27 precedent : @entity105 and @entity103 emerge from the bathyscaphe @entity108 following their successful manned descent to the bottom of the @entity27 in january 1960 now watch the video			2

@entity1 became first person in 50 years to descend almost seven miles down into the @entity27 in the western @entity28
he is now donating the submarine he used for trip - the @entity12
@entity15 will use it for scientific research
