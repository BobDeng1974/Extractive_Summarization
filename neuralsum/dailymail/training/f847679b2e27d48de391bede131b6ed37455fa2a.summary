by @entity0 published : 14:43 est , 24 february 2014 @entity2 : 15:32 est , 24 february 2014 the annoyance of missing a delivery could soon be over thanks to a new ' smart car ' scheme that would let delivery firms simply leave them in the trunk of your car			1
the system would allow deliveries to be made wherever you are , as couriers can track your car via @entity17			1
they can then simply open the trunk , leave the parcel and re-lock it			1
last year , 60 % of people shopping online had problems with the delivery of their item			1
failed first - time deliveries cost the industry an estimated € 1billion in re-delivering costs , @entity23 said			0
despite the rise of online shopping , research has also revealed that over a half of people are not at home to receive online deliveries , leading to further hassle and time wasted through failed deliveries			0
consequently , consumers feels significantly restricted , find their day to day significantly disrupted which results in unnecessary and avoidable constraints on the most precious of commodities , time			0
@entity23 showed off the system at the @entity51 in @entity52 , saying it will ' allow consumers to have their shopping delivered straight to their car , no matter where they are '			0
over half of people ( 60 % ) experienced delivery problems through online shopping last year and failed first - time deliveries cost the industry an estimated € 1billion in re-delivering costs , @entity23 said			1
the new ' digital key ' system allows car owners to choose their car as a delivery option when ordering goods online			1
via a smartphone or a tablet , they are informed when a delivery company wants to drop off or pick up something from the car			2
having accepted the delivery , they then authorise a ' digital key ' and can track when the car is opened and then locked again			1
once the pick - up or drop - off is completed , the digital key ceases to exist			1
the system is based on the functionality of the telematics app @entity81 , which , among other things , makes it possible to remotely heat or cool the car and see its position or fuel level via the mobile phone			2
the technology was trialled during a pilot programme of 100 people , 86 % of which agreed that ‘ roam delivery ’ saved them time			2
' by turning the car into a pickup and drop - off zone through using digital keys we solved a lot of problems since it ’s now possible to deliver the goods to persons and not to places , ' said says @entity106 of @entity23			2
' the test - customers also indicated that the service clearly saved time			0
' we are now further investigating the technology of digital keys and new consumer benefits linked to it , ' a @entity23 staff member showing off the system at @entity51 in @entity52 this week the firm said it hoped the connected car concept would lead to other ideas			0
' it 's all about finding solutions that are intuitive and easy to use and that create benefits in the everyday lives of our customers			0
' the important thing is to make these complex and advanced systems easy to understand for everyone , even behind the wheel			0
' deliveries directly to the car are just one first example of that , '			0
