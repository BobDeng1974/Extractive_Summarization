@entity0 have turned around their dismal start to the season by winning their last four @entity4 games in a row to rise to eighth in the table			1
fans ' unrest over manager @entity10 's tenure has quietened , but recent results do not disguise was has been a disastrous year in terms of results			1
we asked @entity16 's @entity15 his views on where the jury stands @entity10			2
we all know that the prime reason for @entity0 ’s existence , is that the club supplies regular entertainment for the rest of the country , journalists especially			2
in that respect , @entity0 rarely ever let anybody down			2
the club has regularly been referred to as a soap opera but i think circus is a more fitting description much of the time , though that does n’t necessarily then make all of the fans to be clowns			0
@entity10 has turned things around at @entity38 , but recent results can not disguise a terrible year @entity0 have won their last four @entity4 games to rise to eighth in the table the @entity0 supporters have n’t even been left in peace by the wider population to enjoy this surprising , but very welcome , run of five wins in a row			1
apparently we are fickle because we did n’t like getting beat every week and now like it when we win a few matches			0
meanwhile , without any criticism from the ‘ experts ’ , @entity50 fans call for @entity54 ’ head , only a dozen @entity4 matches since he came within a whisker of winning the title			0
similarly , every season @entity58 fans call for @entity60 ’s head whenever they fail to win two matches in a row , the @entity63 having to put up with only @entity65 football for the hundredth season in a row			0
@entity10 watches from the sidelines as @entity0 work towards a 2 - 0 victory away to @entity71 @entity73 stars @entity74 ( @entity75 ) and @entity76 react after earning a 1 - 0 victory over @entity50 played 30 won 9 drawn 5 lost 16 goals for 27 goals against 50 goal difference -23 @entity81 32 there is a lot of talk about whether @entity10 has ‘ proved ’ everybody wrong , though obviously what they are really referring to here is the body of @entity0 fans who finally snapped and vocally / visibly , called for change			1
accusations of fickleness ? @entity0 fans showed unbelievable restraint when they watched their team win only five @entity4 matches in ten months from @entity96 2013			1
the record of all @entity4 matches over the course of 2014 ( above ) reads like this for @entity0 fans , this is what we have ‘ enjoyed ’ from the turn of the year			1
@entity0 supporters rise from their seats as @entity10 pumps his fist during the game against @entity50 it was not too long ago that the @entity0 faithful was calling for their manager to be sacked for those of you good at maths , if you knock the recent run of four @entity4 wins out of four off these stats , you get won 5 , drawn 5 and lost 16			1
with 21 goals scored and 49 against			0
@entity10 might be showing @entity65 form over the last few matches but the end of the season is the only time to judge what kind of job has been done at any club			0
@entity0 are the third best supported club in the country and a constant in the top seven @entity4 turnovers			2
recent results have been buoyed by striker @entity128 who has scored three in his last three games anything less than seventh each season is failure for me and @entity0 are currently standing eighth place in the @entity4			1
fans will always support the players who wear the shirt but respect for the manager has to be earned			0
@entity10 has made a start in reclaiming that respect but he had better keep pedalling if he is going to inspire confidence longer term .			0

@entity0 have won their last four *consecutive* @entity4 games
supporters ' calls for manager @entity10 to be sacked have quietened
the jury is still out on the boss after only nine wins from 30 games in 2014
