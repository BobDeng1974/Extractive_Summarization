if you are the kind of person who will wrap yourself in the @entity5 's flag as you shout ' @entity6 ' at the tv this summer , the bulletin on @entity1 is good news			1
no doubt many @entity10 fans punched the air when it emerged that @entity1 had suffered a knee injury at @entity14 's training in @entity15 and might be out of the clash on june 19			1
' @entity1 is out of the @entity17 - get in ! ' ' i hope it 's a bad one			1
' ' right , all we need is @entity21 to break down now			0
' feeling down : @entity1 is an injury doubt for @entity14 's second group game against @entity10 sensational : @entity1 played a key role in @entity26 's title challenge this season with 31 league goals and on and on			1
any advantage to the team you support is always welcomed , whether that 's your star striker returning from injury , or your rivals ' no 9 pulling his hamstring			2
@entity10 vs @entity14 with @entity1 sitting in the stands is wholly more appealing to @entity10 fans than the same fixture with @entity1 walking out of the tunnel in his blue shirt			1
but what about the entertainment ? what about watching the stars ? what about those goals you 'll still be talking about in 30 years ? the @entity48 comes along every season and if your team gets to the final , they will play a total of 13 matches			0
so , even if a star player picks up an injury , you 're still likely to see him at some point during the tournament			2
now compare that with the @entity17			0
an unfortunate knee niggle - one diagnosis on @entity1 is that he 'll miss four to six weeks , another said he 'll be fit in three - can ultimately rule you out of a tournament that only takes place every four years			2
that 's what you call a bad break			0
stars : no - one would want to watch the @entity17 without @entity68 ( left ) or @entity69 whether you fall into the @entity68 or @entity69 camp , few would claim they are not excited about watching one or the other - or both - this summer			1
we want them to turn it up to 11 in @entity76			0
and it should be the same for @entity1			2
this is the man who enjoyed an exceptional season with @entity26 , scoring 31 goals as he took them to the brink of a first title since 1990			0
there 's no - one who watches @entity86 on a regular basis that was n't blown away by @entity1 at some point this season			1
taking that form into the @entity17 , he would be a joy to watch			0
you hope the same for @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 and the other leading figures of the game			0
the @entity17 has a history of high - profile injuries ( @entity100 in 1966 , @entity101 in 2010 ) and there are already a few decent players out of @entity76 ( @entity104 and @entity105 , for sure , and they may be joined by @entity106			0
) so , if you want to sit back next month and watch the best players in the best tournament , start crossing your fingers that @entity1 is an exceptionally quick healer .			1

if we want the best competitions we need the best players to be available
if @entity68 or @entity69 were out we would be *sad* , why are n't we for @entity1 ?
too many big names have already been ruled out through injury
@entity1 may never hit this sort of form again so we need to enjoy him
