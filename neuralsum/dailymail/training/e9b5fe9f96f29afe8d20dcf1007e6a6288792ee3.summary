by @entity0 published : 06:55 est , 31 may 2013 updated : 09:10 est , 31 may 2013 @entity1 became the first @entity3 airline to take delivery of the new ultra-green @entity6 plane today			1
after years of production delays and a grounding earlier this year on safety concerns , the plane touched down at @entity12 this morning			2
@entity1 had hoped to start flying the fuel - efficient , 290 - passenger @entity6 at the beginning of this month			1
touchdown : the @entity1 - liveried 787 @entity6 arrives at @entity12 today as the airline take delivery of their new plane arrival : another aeroplane takes off in the background at the @entity6 , the first to be delivered to a @entity3 airline , taxis on arrival at @entity12 arrival : the @entity3 's first registered and operated @entity6 sits on the tarmac at @entity12 disembarking : the @entity1 plane will fly with commercial passengers for the first time on july 8 arrival : @entity1 managing director @entity30 waves from the steps of the aeroplane after the 787 arrived in @entity12 today but earlier this year battery smoke emanating from two dreamliner planes operated by @entity36 carriers led to a grounding of the world 's 787 fleet and a halt to all deliveries			1
it was the first time since 1979 that every plane of a particular type was ordered to stay out of the air for safety reasons			0
this meant @entity1 had to scrap its dreamliner flights planned for may and june			2
with the plane given the go - ahead to take to the air again , @entity1 will begin @entity6 flights on july 8			1
initially , @entity1 is operating the state - of - the - art aircraft from @entity55 , @entity12 , @entity56 and @entity58 airports to @entity59 in @entity60 and to @entity61 in @entity62			1
crowd : people watch from the viewing area as the new plane arrives in the @entity3 for the first time			2
although the @entity6 has flown out of @entity69 before , this is the first one to be received by a @entity3 firm interest : plane enthusiasts take pictures as the airline comes into land at @entity12 this morning first : @entity1 is initially operating the state - of - the - art aircraft from @entity55 , @entity12 , @entity56 and @entity58 airports to @entity59 in @entity60 and to @entity61 in @entity62 @entity77 : the cabin is more spacious and the windows 30 per cent larger than on other aircraft flight deck : captain @entity82 ( right ) and captain @entity83 in the cockpit today after the 787 touched down at @entity12 crew : @entity1 managing director @entity30 ( front ) with the flight captains and crew who were on the 787 @entity6 seats : 210 to 290			1
range : 8,800 to 9,400 miles			0
@entity93 speed : mach 0.85 , about 650 mph			0
cargo volume : 4,400 cubic feet			0
maximum takeoff weight : 502,500 pounds			0
list price : $ 193.5 million ( £ 120million ) , although airlines often negotiate discounts			0
components : 50 per cent carbon fiber , 20 per cent aluminum , 15 per cent titanium , 10 per cent steel , 5 per cent other			0
engines : @entity105 or @entity106			0
next winter , @entity1 will fly the @entity6 direct to @entity108 in @entity109 and from next summer it will use the plane for flights to @entity113 and to @entity114 in @entity62			1
@entity6 had hoped that the plane would go into commercial service around 2008 but this date continually slipped as production difficulties dogged the plane			2
it was not until october 2011 that @entity36 carrier @entity120 operated the first @entity6 commercial flight			2
features include a state - of - the - art flight deck , with larger screens and electronic checks lists and ‘ smooth - wing technology ' to aid aerodynamics and wing efficiency			0
the cabin has dimmable windows , which are 30 per cent larger than similar - sized planes and operated using touch - button controls			2
a filtration process removes odours , bacteria and viruses from the air inside , helping to reduce dizziness , headaches , eye irritation and dryness			1
the 787 's cabin is pressurized to a maximum level of 6,000 feet - 2,000 feet lower than most other aircraft - and because passengers absorb 8 per cent more oxygen into the blood at this altitude this also reduce headaches , dizziness and fatigue			1
@entity1 managing director @entity30 said today : ' after much anticipation , we are very excited to welcome the @entity6 to our fleet and as the first airline in the @entity3 to take delivery we hope our customers will enjoy the unique experience of this revolutionary aircraft			1
' high interest : the 290 - seat plane is more fuel efficient than its predecessors , and more comfortable for passengers up close : the plane was originally due to be delivered to @entity1 around a month ago , but it was delayed as the 787 fleet was grounded ready for first proper take off : with the plane given the go - ahead to take to the air again , @entity1 will begin @entity6 flights on july 8 @entity1 is taking delivery of eight @entity174 in total , up to may 2015			1
@entity176 is due to receive the first four of 24 @entity174 this year , while @entity177 will get the first of its 16 in september next year			1
meanwhile , @entity1 's parent company , @entity179 , announced a commitment today to purchase 60 @entity182 aircraft , with the ability to purchase up to a further 90			2
the multibillion - pound deal is subject to shareholder approval , with the delivery of the aircraft scheduled to start in january 2018 and run for five years			0
the @entity6 has been plagued by problems since its launch in 2008 , even before two aircraft developed battery problems			2
fanatics : a whole line of people take pictures of the aeroplane landing at @entity12 interest : the plane arrived at @entity12 at around 11am this morning in january , all @entity198 was forced to cancel a domestic flight to @entity200 after a computer wrongly indicated a problem with the 787 's brakes			1
the day before , a fuel leak forced a 787 operated by @entity205 to cancel takeoff at @entity208 's @entity207			0
and a day before that , another @entity6 caught fire after dropping off 183 passengers and crew from @entity200 at @entity208 when a battery in the jet 's auxiliary power system overheated			1
nobody was hurt as passengers and crew had already disembarked			0
but those were not the only issues that have blemished the much - vaunted launch of air travel 's latest addition			0
last december @entity223 ' brand - new @entity6 , carrying 174 passengers and 10 crew , was forced to make an emergency landing in @entity227 due to a mechanical issue			0
in the same month , @entity229 grounded one of its @entity174 after several similar faults caused electrical problems			0
in july last year , debris from a brand - new @entity6 's engine sparked a fire at a @entity237 airport forcing emergency crews to close the @entity239 for more than an hour			1
and an incident in february 2012 saw @entity6 report signs of ' delamination ' occurring on a support structure in the @entity6 's rear fuselage , launching an inspection			0
troubled : a burned battery from the @entity6 which caused the fleet to be grounded earlier this year after they caught fire on two separate flights @entity251 : a line of @entity6 jets parked in @entity254 , @entity255 , after the planes were grounded in january this year			1

@entity251 grounded in january after batteries on two planes caught fire
@entity1 will begin @entity6 flights on july 8
crowd watch as the aircraft touches down at @entity12
@entity176 and @entity177 also have large orders of the plane
