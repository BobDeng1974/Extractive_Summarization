record numbers of @entity2 are unable to afford their homes , new data shows			2
housing is considered unaffordable when more than 30 per cent of the household 's income is spent on rent or a mortgage , and according to a report from the @entity11 at @entity12 , more than 40 million @entity2 families - 35.3 per cent - were in that category at the end of 2012			1
the proportion of renters who pay more than 30 per cent of their income on housing rose 12 percentage points over the past decade , reaching 50 per cent in 2010			1
crisis : despite a slight decline in 2012 , the number of households that pay unaffordable rents is high among them are 27 per cent of renters whose housing is termed a ' severe burden ' by the researchers , meaning they pay more than half of what they make on rent			1
this problem is especially severe for low - income earners			0
more than 80 per cent of households who made less than $ 15,000 in 2011 paid more than 30 per cent of it on housing - and 71 per cent paid at least half			2
those households also spent $ 130 less on food - 40 per cent less than those households without the housing burdens			2
' housing affordability is thus clearly linked to the problem of hunger in @entity2 , ' note the report 's authors , adding that these households also spend significantly less on healthcare and retirement savings plans			1
' these cutbacks seriously undermine the basic well - being of low - income households , ' the report says			0
nowhere to go : in the 1970s there was a surplus of affordable housing , but now there is a shortfall of 5.3 million between 2004 and 2013 , renting has increased across all age groups bar those aged 75 and older			0
@entity63 for households aged 30 - 64 are now at their highest in the last 30 years and expected to continue to grow , while families with children are almost as likely to rent as single people			0
and while in the 1970s there was a surplus of low - cost rental propertie , there is now a deficit of 5.3 million units			0
since the recession the number of households with very low incomes ( defined as not exceeding 50 per cent of area median income ) has increased by 3.3 million , but the number able to obtain housing assistance has expanded by only 225,000			1
presently , only 23.8 per cent of households who need assistance receive it			1
the crisis especially affects minorities			0
in 2012 , 27 per cent of black households , 24 per cent of @entity88 households and 21 per cent of @entity90 households were paying more than half their incomes for housing , compared to 14 per cent of white households			2
' for renters , this is indeed a crisis of affordability , ' says the report .			0

35.3 per cent of @entity2 households spend more than 30 per cent of their income on rent , a proportion that is considered unaffordable
the proportion of renters who pay 30 per cent more for housing rose 12 per cent over the last decade
among the 40 million households whose housing is unaffordable are 27 per cent who pay 50 per cent or more for their homes
presently , only 23.8 per cent of households who need housing assistance receive it
