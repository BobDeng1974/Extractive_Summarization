in a move that may ease — or exacerbate — spiraling tensions with @entity3 over a potential @entity5 nuclear deal , the @entity0 has decided against snubbing @entity8 's leading @entity7 lobby and will send president @entity10 's national security adviser @entity9 and @entity12 ambassador @entity11 to the annual policy conference			1
the @entity14 announced thursday that @entity15 and @entity16 would speak at its conference that begins this weekend , and the @entity0 's top spokesman confirmed their attendance at his daily briefing			1
the @entity0 's decision to name @entity15 as one of its liaisons is a tacit acknowledgement of its support for remarks she made earlier this week claiming that @entity0 speaker @entity28 and @entity3 prime minister @entity29 had ' injected a degree of partisanship ' into the relationship between the two countries when they planned a @entity36 visit for the world leader without first notifying the @entity10 administration			1
the @entity0 has decided against snubbing @entity8 's leading @entity7 lobby and will send president @entity10 's national security adviser @entity9 to speak to the group			1
the @entity0 's decision to name @entity15 as one of its liaisons is a tacit acknowledgement of its support for remarks she made earlier this week claiming that @entity0 speaker @entity28 and @entity3 prime minister @entity29 had ' injected a degree of partisanship ' into the relationship between the two countries @entity15 , appearing on a @entity48 program when she made the assertion , said the move was ' destructive to the fabric of the relationship ' between @entity3 and the @entity8			1
asked about her comments on wednesday afternoon , a spokesman for the @entity0 claimed @entity15 's comments were consistent with the administration 's past statements			2
@entity15 , a top national security adviser to the president , was simply making the argument that ' reducing the @entity8 - @entity3 relationship to just a relationship between two political parties is destructive to a relationship between our two countries , ' the spokesman , @entity59 contended			1
' the president himself has raised this concern			0
' moments later , @entity74 said , ' so what we hope is that we 'll continue to see leadership in this country and in @entity3 that will not allow the relationship between our two countries to be dragged down by party politics			2
' for generations ' both countries have succeeded in not allowing this critically important international relationship to get buffeted by those kinds of political arguments ' that the president believes could be harmful to both countries ' national security , @entity74 said			0
@entity15 , however , appeared to be engaging in the same kind of ' destructive ' behavior that the @entity0 has said it is seeking to avoid			0
@entity8 officials had floated the idea of sending a non-cabinet level official to the event to show the administration 's deep displeasure with @entity29 over his speech to @entity95 next week , in which he will argue against an @entity5 deal but decided against and on thursday said it would offer up @entity15 and @entity16			1
in their as - yet unscheduled appearances at the @entity14 conference that runs from sunday to tuesday , @entity15 and @entity16 will stress the importance of the @entity8 - @entity3 relationship and the administration 's commitment to @entity3 's security , according to @entity8 officials			1
but , they will also make the administration 's case for the ongoing negotiations with @entity5 before an audience of more than 16,000 pro-israel activists that is likely to be hostile to the talks and deeply concerned by growing animosity between @entity10 and @entity29 and their top aides over the prime minister 's speech and his opposition to one of the president 's signature foreign policy goals			1
in a break with protocol , the invitation for @entity29 to speak was orchestrated by @entity127 congressional leaders without input from the @entity0 or @entity129 , angering senior administration officials who believe it was politically motivated			0
@entity29 declined an invitation to meet privately with @entity134 members of @entity95 and a number of @entity136 have said they will not attend the speech			2
no senior @entity8 officials will meet @entity29 during his trip to @entity36			0
the administration has said the visit is too close to @entity3 's upcoming elections and it does n't want to demonstrate any favoritism			0
both vice president @entity144 and secretary of state @entity145 will be out of the country for the visit 's duration on travel that was organized only after the prime minister 's trip was announced			0
the @entity0 is also sending @entity12 ambassador @entity11 to the annual policy conference in an apparent effort to try to tamp down an increasingly vitriolic back - and - forth between the @entity8 and its top @entity155 ally			1
but , it is not at all clear if it will have that effect the administration 's choice of @entity15 and @entity16 to address the @entity14 conference , at which @entity29 will also speak , is an apparent effort to try to tamp down an increasingly vitriolic back - and - forth between the @entity8 and its top @entity155 ally			1
but , it is not at all clear if it will have that effect			0
after @entity15 's remarks on @entity168 's @entity48 program , @entity145 openly questioned @entity29 's judgment in opposing a potential @entity5 deal , recalling his support for the 2003 @entity173 war and prediction that it would bring stability to the @entity155			1
' he may have a judgment that just may not be correct here , ' the secretary told a congressional hearing			0
@entity0 spokesman @entity181 said wednesday that sending @entity183 members to speak at the annual policy conference was consistent with the administration 's participation in the past , other than the two times @entity10 spoke himself , and that scheduling the speeches this close to the conference was n't unusual			0
' certainly if it 's perceived by some as an effort to demonstrate bipartisan support for the relationship between the @entity8 and @entity3 , that would be great , ' he told reporters			2
at a @entity199 news conference on thursday , house speaker @entity28 rejected @entity15 's criticism , arguing that a ' bad deal ' with @entity5 would be counterproductive			2
' the president 's national security adviser says that it 's destructive for the prime minister of @entity3 to address the @entity95 next week			1
i could n't disagree more , ' @entity28 told reporters			0
' the @entity8 people , and both parties in @entity95 , have always stood with @entity3			2
nothing and no one should get in the way of that			0
' that 's why it is ' so important for the @entity8 people to hear what prime minister @entity29 has to say about the grave threats that they 're facing , ' @entity28 continued			2
' so i 'm glad the prime minister is coming and i 'm glad that most of my colleagues , @entity136 and @entity127 , will be there to hear what he has to say			0
' rep. @entity225 spoke to @entity29 earlier this month and suggested that he deliver his speech in the congressional auditorium behind closed doors , a venue that accommodates all lawmakers and would allow for any classified information that @entity3 might have on @entity5 's capabilities , according to a senior @entity0 lawmaker			1
that alternative was also presented to @entity3 ambassador @entity234 in private meeting earlier this month with a half dozen @entity136			0
so far , no changes to his speech have been made , however , and it scheduled to be broadcast to the public .			0
