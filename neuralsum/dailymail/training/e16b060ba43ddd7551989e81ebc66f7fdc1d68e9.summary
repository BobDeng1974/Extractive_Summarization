the man they call @entity2 is recalling his part in the last @entity5 tie between @entity6 and @entity7			1
he is picturing the coach journey through streets filled with people , the tense atmosphere and the celebrations that followed			2
it is 47 years since @entity14 sent a missile into the net to secure @entity6 a 2 - 0 victory and propel his team to their most recent piece of major silverware			1
that semi-final , in front of more than 60,000 fans , took place on april 27 , 1968 , at @entity25 , the stadium equidistant from these local rivals			1
@entity14 ( left ) and @entity27 pictured in the dressing room after the 1968 semi-final win over @entity7 the @entity2 , as @entity14 was known , scored a club - record 279 goals for @entity6 during a 17 - year spell on saturday they meet again , in the fourth round of the @entity5 at @entity34 ’s ; an encounter eagerly anticipated by both sets of supporters			1
‘ it brings back memories , ’ says @entity14			2
‘ since the draw we ’ve had @entity43 supporters saying they ’ll get their own back for ’ 68 — they have n’t forgotten			2
the city is very excited			2
’ in a club - record 720 competitive matches between 1963 and 1980 @entity14 , now 69 , scored a club - record 279 goals , despite operating in midfield			1
perhaps none will be treasured more than his rocket at @entity25			2
‘ @entity57 put me through at the edge of the box and i drilled an angled shot into the far corner			2
that settled it really , ’ he says with the same straightness as the shot was hit			2
the late @entity27 , another legendary figure for the club , had scored the opener			1
@entity14 adds : ‘ we had a free - kick just outside the box			1
@entity57 touched the ball to me and i drove it			2
the keeper dived and saved it , but parried it out and @entity27 followed it up			1
’ bomber poses with the @entity5 in front of a stature of himself at the @entity76 the bomber smashed home @entity6 's second goal during the semi-final win in 1968 @entity27 also scored the only goal in the final at @entity83 against an @entity85 side containing @entity88 winners @entity86 and @entity89			1
lifting that trophy remains perhaps the highest peak in the club ’s history			1
the win over @entity7 provided the perfect penultimate chapter			1
‘ it was a tremendous day , ’ says @entity14			2
‘ especially because it was a local derby			2
it was a sell - out crowd and there was all the ballyhoo of knowing @entity83 was the prize			1
it added an extra tingle to the game			2
‘ we all had to meet at @entity105 to get a coach that would drive us the short distance to @entity25			1
we passed through swarms of fans lining the way			2
it is a tremendous ground			2
‘ both sets of fans made the occasion			0
you could cut the atmosphere with a knife			0
we were nervous , too			0
i know we won 2 - 0 but they had better chances than us			1
@entity120 , their lad up front , had three or four but did n’t stick them away			0
fortunately @entity27 and i did			1
’ @entity14 says good fortune played a part throughout their run			0
‘ in the third round we had @entity127 away			0
they scored first and i equalised with a penalty			0
@entity14 is applauded by @entity6 players and staff at the unveiling of his statue last november @entity14 holds the @entity5 as he poses with @entity133 beside the statue at the @entity76 ‘ then , with about three minutes to go , they scored again and we thought we were out			1
@entity136 , our big centre half , kicked the ball out of the ground in disgust			0
but the referee for some reason disallowed it			0
even today our lads do n’t know why			0
we got them back to our place and won comfortably			0
‘ in the next round we were losing at home to @entity149 and i hit one from outside the box but never got a good connection			0
their goalkeeper went down on one knee to collect but the ball hit a divot , bounced over his shoulder and into the back of the net			0
we could easily have gone out			0
when we beat @entity160 in the quarter - final after a second replay we really believed it would be our year			1
‘ @entity14 nearly missed the final with a thigh injury — ‘ it was touch and go ’ — but recovered and was able to enjoy the day he had dreamed of as a schoolboy			1
‘ the first thing we did was take the @entity5 straight in the bath and drink champagne from it , ’ he says			1
‘ we stayed in @entity173 that night and went to the @entity174 , had a good sing - song			1
one thing that sticks in my mind was the manager @entity178 not letting the trophy out of his grasp			0
’ the @entity2 made a club - record 720 competitive appearances for @entity6 between 1963 and 1980 @entity14 's statue at the @entity76 , pictured before the match against @entity185 earlier in january @entity14 knows @entity186 craves a similar scenario , even if @entity189 survival is his primary mission			1
‘ he ’s said a couple of times in interviews that he likes the @entity5 and wants to do well in it — that ’s music to my ears			1
we ’ve had one or two managers in the past who have n’t really bothered about it			0
the priority nowadays is to stay in the @entity189 because that ’s where all the money is — that did n’t come into the equation through the years i played			0
@entity5 games were something special			1
‘ the youngsters must get all these stories about @entity83 from their parents and grandparents			1
i know it ’s a long way off but it ’s the dream the fans have — and players should as well			0
‘ i think it will be a really hard - fought game			1
@entity43 have picked up since @entity217 has come in			0
he ’s put a bit of spirit back into them			0
he ’ll be steaming into them , emphasising there is a big scalp here to be won			0
‘ i ’m sure @entity14 will have the lads up for it			0
what i ’ve noticed in these few games is that he plays every ball			0
his passion for the game is clear			0
you hope that gets through to the lads in the dressing room			0
i ’m sure it does			0
