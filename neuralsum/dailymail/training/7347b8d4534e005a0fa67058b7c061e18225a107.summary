he ’s not been in charge 24 hours , but @entity1 are already showing the standard @entity3 qualities			1
fight , grit and stubbornness ; it was like @entity3 had been in charge for years as the @entity1 produced a gutsy display to hold @entity9 to a draw at @entity11			1
perhaps , under sacked @entity13 , this @entity1 side would have crumbled after going behind after 10 minutes to @entity15 ’s header			1
no such chance with @entity3 at the helm , @entity18 securing a valuable point for the @entity21 club			1

goals : @entity18 42 manager : @entity70 and @entity71 7 referee : @entity73 attendance : 34,914 man of the match : lescott @entity78 marshalled @entity9 's midfield as the home side settled for a point at @entity82 here for our brilliant @entity84			1
@entity15 heads the ball past goalkeeper @entity51 to open the scoring for @entity9 @entity15 celebrates his and @entity9 's first goal of 2015 with defender @entity31 as the home side took the lead against @entity1 @entity9 's @entity15 has scored eight goals from just 14 shots on target in the @entity94 since arriving last summer			1
the @entity96 's appointment as @entity13 ’s successor was confirmed on thursday morning , and @entity98 , who has been out of football since leaving @entity101 in august , wasted no time getting into the swing of things			0
@entity3 , together with his assistant @entity104 , were in situ in the stands well before kick - off as they started the process of trying to safeguard their record of never being relegated			1
@entity70 and @entity71 were on the touchline for the @entity1 , but there was no escaping @entity98 ’ presence			2
‘ i ’m sure it ( @entity98 ’ presence ) had an effect , ’ admitted coach @entity71			0
‘ he introduced himself to the players this morning , he popped in at half time and after the game as well			1
‘ but he let us get on with it today			0
anyone who knows @entity13 [ @entity123 ] knows how organised he is , so we had an outline and we did most of the work on the team with @entity13			0
new @entity1 manager @entity3 watches from the stand alongside chairman @entity128 ( right ) @entity3 , who replaces @entity13 in the hot seat , signs an autograph for a fan before his new side kicked off at @entity11 ‘ @entity133 [ @entity104 ] let us get on with the organisation			1
he [ @entity104 ] came down to the touchline with one or two suggestions			0
‘ but the players are very professional so all the preparation was done beforehand			0
’ @entity3 , however , was powerless as he watched his new side fall behind as @entity15 glanced home @entity142 ’s cross from the left after an excellent @entity9 move			1
@entity51 prevented the visitors from falling further behind just two minutes later , saving @entity146 ’s fierce effort after the former @entity147 forward tormented @entity53			0
it was just the start @entity50 was after following two consecutive losses , albeit against @entity150 and @entity151			0
however , @entity1 could have drawn level in the 23rd minute with what would have been one of the goals of the season			2
@entity55 directed a brilliant first - time volley from @entity56 ’s cross straight towards the top left - hand corner , only for @entity25 to deny him with an excellent one - handed stop			0
@entity3 was taking note , gesturing to @entity104 and chairman @entity162 at regular intervals ; though he would n’t have been impressed by @entity60 ’s finishing in the 26th minute as the forward fired wide from a good position			2
however , he would have been heartened with the way the @entity1 fought back into the encounter after their dismal start			2
@entity9 had n’t pushed on following their early opener			2
indeed , @entity50 admitted after the game that his side were feeling the impact of playing three games in six days			0
@entity60 tries his luck with a rifled effort for @entity1 as the visitors pushed forward in the first half @entity70 took charge of @entity1 as caretaker manager for the final time as @entity3 prepares to take over @entity58 slides in to tackle @entity36 and wins the ball in one of the midfield exchanges at @entity11 @entity50 cut an anxious figure in his technical area , he had reason to be , too			1
in true @entity98 style , @entity1 were making life terribly uncomfortable for the hosts			2
and in the 42nd minute , they were level after a rapid counter attack which saw @entity60 travel half the length of the pitch before locating the unmarked @entity18 , who cooly fired past @entity25			2
the move had @entity98 applauding ; tangible evidence that in @entity18 , he has a bona - fide @entity94 goalscorer			1
and the striker picked up where he left off as the second - half got underway , his deflected shot from the edge of the box well saved by @entity25			0
@entity56 , two minutes later , had the visiting fans celebrating , rippling the net with a fierce angled shot – but the effort actually hit the side - netting			0
@entity15 lies injured after being foiled by @entity51 as @entity9 chased a winner in the dying stages at @entity11 @entity51 checks on the injured @entity15 after the pair collided accidentally in the penalty box as @entity9 pushed forward @entity15 grimaces as he leaves the field injured to be replaced by fellow striker @entity216 after their quickfire start , @entity9 were on the ropes			1
@entity50 threw on @entity37 in place of @entity36 in an attempt to re-invigorate his team and the move nearly paid instant dividends as the impressive @entity142 hit the post with a superbly executed 25 - yard free - kick			0
with 30 minutes left to play , @entity104 made his way down to the dug - out to pass on instructions to @entity39 and @entity71			0
if there was any doubt , the @entity98 era was already in full swing			0
had @entity15 , who moments later limped off with a back problem that leaves his place in @entity234 ’s @entity236 squad in doubt , converted @entity39 ’s low cross then @entity3 would have needed to devise a new game plan			1
but the @entity1 were defending doggedly , @entity54 and @entity53 pillars of strength in the heart of their back four			2
in the end , @entity1 held on , pretty comfortably , for a point as the home side were booed off			1
it seems @entity3 is already working his magic .			0

new @entity1 manager @entity3 watched from the stands as his side earned a point at @entity11
@entity15 headed @entity9 in front but @entity18 equalised for the visitors before half time
@entity9 *remain* sixth while @entity1 are one place above the @entity94 relegation *zone*
