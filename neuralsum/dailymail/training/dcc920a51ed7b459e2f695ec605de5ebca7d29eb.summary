by @entity0 and @entity1 follow @ @ kie1410 the @entity2 and @entity3 became the first teams to take a drinks break during this year 's @entity6 after temperatures in @entity8 reached @entity9			1
as temperatures rose in @entity11 , the teams were given official three - minute ' cooling breaks ' on the 30 and 75 minute marks to take in drinks at @entity14			1
the extreme heat , which saw fans retreat to the back of the stands to avoid the sun , prompted fears over the suitability of @entity22 as the 2022 tournament hosts , as temperatures there often approach @entity26			1
the three minutes , which also gave @entity3 boss @entity52 and @entity2 manager @entity53 time to talk tactics with the teams , were added to stoppage time at the end of each half			1
@entity59 claimed he used the second one to change his tactics and bring about his team 's eventual 2 - 1 victory			1
the @entity63 had come from a goal down against @entity3 , winning a penalty deep in injury time with the scores level			2
empty seats : many fans left their seats in an attempt to avoid the intense heat and scorching sunshine time : the water breaks gave @entity52 - still wearing his suit jacket despite the raging heat - three minutes to talk tactics with his players @entity78 scored from the penalty spot after @entity81 captain @entity80 was punished for his foul on @entity63 winger @entity83			1
the new @entity85 manager said : ' first i had changed to 4 - 3 - 3 and we created a lot of opportunities			2
' then i moved to plan b and yes i did that in the cooling break			0
that ’s a clever way of benefiting from these breaks			2
' this is the first @entity6 where cooling breaks have been used , with each venue 's medical teams monitoring the temperatures at pitch level and employing breaks if the mercury rises above @entity102			1
referees can decide when to stop play in order for the players to take on water and cool down			0
the breaks would certainly be needed in @entity22 , given temperatures can rise to a worrying 50 degrees between may and september , and has been as high as @entity109			1
winner : @entity78 scored from the penalty spot deep into injury time , taking the @entity2 into the @entity6 quarter finals it has been argued that such heat would prove dangerous for both players and supporters , while the area can also be subjected to sandstorms during the dry season			1
if the tournament was moved to the winter , as has been proposed , the temperature would be likely to be between the mid 20s and 30s			2
prior to yesterday 's match , both teams had been forced to switch training venues because @entity47 deemed the pitch at @entity14 unable to cope with two practice sessions and a match in two days			2
the @entity63 coach had warned before the last - 16 game that players may have hallucinated were they not allowed to take on water during the match			0
@entity135 too ! @entity136 took his own drinks break , taking to @entity138 to pose with his drink in the sun ‘ if we have to , we will take drinks and put bottles round the pitch			0
it is extremely important and that is why a dehydration element was included in training and friendlies , ' he said			0
‘ every player will become dehydrated			0
some lose four litres during the game			0
‘ they have to replenish otherwise they will start hallucinating			0
' elsewhere , though , former @entity157 and @entity85 defender @entity136 joined in , taking to social media to show off a selfie of himself taking his own drinks break			0
but one man who the seemed to not be bothered by the heat was @entity52 , who kept his suit jacket on throughout as he watched his team concede two goals in as many minutes to crash out			0
@entity52 , the least - paid manager at the @entity6 on £ 125,000 - a - year , coped well with the heat since the tournament began , leading @entity3 out of a tough group a at the expense of @entity169 and @entity170 .			1

referee @entity41 ordered breaks on the 30 and 75 minute marks
temperature reached a *sweltering* @entity177 in @entity11 at @entity14
supporters left their sun - *drenched* seats to find shade as temperatures rose
temperatures in 2022 venue @entity22 likely to reach *40* degrees or more
@entity2 beat @entity3 2 - 1 to reach quarter - final of the @entity6
