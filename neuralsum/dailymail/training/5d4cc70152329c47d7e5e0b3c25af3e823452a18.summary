it found that while many trusts regularly claim 98 per cent approval rates , patient surveys reveal nearly half are dissatisfied with the food			0
many hospitals spend just £ 3 a day on meals for in - patients , compared with £ 5 a day set aside for prisoners			1
regulations control the quality of food served in government departments , schools and prisons , but there is no such system in the @entity6			0
‘ surely patients … have the same right to good food as government ministers , school children and prisoners ? ’ asked the campaign ’s coordinator , @entity52 , who was at yesterday ’s reception			1
benefits : the prince , pictured alongside @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , said improving hospital food would speed up recovery times taste test : the @entity62 smells pesto sauce as he tours the kitchens of the @entity71 in @entity72 in 2008 the event at @entity27 was organised by @entity1 and the @entity19 , for @entity6 commissioners			1
it highlighted the @entity76 ( @entity77 ) , brought in last month , which allows commissioners to reward hospital trusts for delivering high quality food			0
in a speech @entity1 said it was important to ‘ see food as a medicine in itself ’			2
the prince said that what patients eat ‘ will feed enormously into improving not only people ’s health but also reducing the levels of malnutrition amongst the elderly ’			1
‘ you can imagine just how delighted i was that last month @entity92 launched an initiative @entity76 , which for the first time actually encouraged commissioners to make hospital food a clinical priority , ’ he added			2
the prince pointed to @entity99 , former catering manager at the @entity71 in @entity72 , as an ‘ inspiration ’			0
mr @entity99 persuaded hospital authorities to let him open its shut - down kitchens , hire an organic chef and link up with local farmers in @entity105 so that fresh seasonal produce could be supplied to the hospital			0

this kind of set - up , @entity1 said , created a ‘ virtuous circle ’ of sustainability , helping the local economy and ensuring better patient health			2
mr @entity99 said : ‘ i go for quality over cost each time			0
for too many years now hospitals have been using the meals they serve … as a means of cutting costs , putting pressure on outside catering companies to deliver cheap and frankly sub-standard food … i actually found it cheaper in many respects to make the food from scratch rather than buy it in			0
’ @entity134 , which also transformed its menu , was awarded a @entity137 mark by the @entity25 , of which @entity1 is president			0
catering manager @entity138 said the cost of food per head is £ 4 a day , adding : ‘ when you think that we are also sourcing all our food locally and in doing so benefiting the local economy … it ’s a very good deal			2

other areas of healthcare could benefit including malnutrition in the elderly
many hospitals are still spending just £ 3 a day on meals for in - patients
