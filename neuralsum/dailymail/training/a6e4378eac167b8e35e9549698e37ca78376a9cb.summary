as the hosts of the next @entity3 and @entity2 , @entity0 will soon be welcoming people from around the globe to its shores			2
but after visiting the country for a new @entity10 series that starts this evening , @entity7 has concluded it is not a place for the ' faint - hearted '			1
or indeed for those who believe women should not be treated as disposable sex objects			0
ms @entity7 was shocked by the popular television shows beloved by the nation that seemingly objectify and degrade women			1
ms @entity7 describes the contest as ' a spectacular feast of the flesh '			2
girls from every walk of life are whittled down by a public vote to 15 finalists by undertaking a range of tasks - all while wearing thongs that show off their derrieres			0
the final is a catwalk show where the women gyrate and parade in their skimpy bikinis while the cameramen take gratuitous rear and up - skirt shots			2
ms @entity7 said she felt awkward watching the final , adding : ' it 's a bit disconcerting being a woman here and not dressed in dental floss			0
' ' it 's humiliating but at the same time there is the status that comes with it so you end up forgetting about the humiliation because you are on tv ' she met one of the finalists , @entity21 , 23 , who has a degree in sports science but admitted she is happy to hide her intellect on the show in favour of flaunting her body			2
she said : ' in @entity0 , to work in tv and media we need to get in through the backdoor which means that first of all we need to show our beauty			1
once you have you foot in the door then you will be able to show your intellectual skills			0
' one male @entity0 journalist explained to ms @entity7 why miss @entity22 was such a popular tv show with both men and women of the country : ' @entity0 woman like to be , not exactly objectified , but they like to be admired			1
@entity0 women have the highest self esteem in the world			1
' bottoms up : the @entity30 contest is one of the country 's most watched tv shows ms @entity7 found another tv show that illustrates the country 's ' questionable fixation with women ' in @entity102 , is a @entity0 institution which has been on the air for the past eight years			1
ms @entity7 said : ' every week the show features the @entity106 , a troop of bikini clad women who compete in spectacularly pointless games			1
' ' as we are portrayed as only having a beautiful body we are kind of a disposable thing - so if you do n't agree with something you will get eliminated and someone else will replace you ' she noted that the games - including one where women in skimpy outfits boxed on roller skates and another where women pretending to be mice have to eat cheese despite being held back by elastic around their faces - can be as painful as they are humiliating			2
she met one of the retired ' @entity106 ' , @entity128 , 23 , who confided that she had found the experience humiliating but she did it for the fame			0
she said : ' being honest with you it 's humiliating but at the same time there is the status that comes with it so you end up forgetting about the humiliation because you are on tv and it has good ratings			0
' the @entity30 final involves a catwalk show where the women gyrate and parade in their skimpy bikinis while the cameramen take gratuitous shots @entity128 said during her six months on the show she did things such as mud wrestling another woman in bikini and plunging down a water slide naked to land in a tiny paddling pool			1
ms @entity7 observed of the show : ' it turns out that @entity155 can do whatever they want to young women in the name of entertainment			1
' @entity128 said she did have a limit to what she was prepared to do - but that ultimately led to her dismissal			0
she said : ' as we are portrayed as only having a beautiful body we are kind of a disposable thing - so if you do n't agree with something you will get eliminated and someone else will replace you			0
' there are so many things i refused to do and somethings i 'd never do , this is one of the reasons they decide to fire me from the programme			0
' ms @entity7 investigated tv shows in @entity0 as part of her new four - part series , @entity182 on @entity183 , that uncovers how ' television is the window into the soul of a nation ' by exploring what popular tv reveals about a county and its culture			1
in future episodes she will discover how @entity193 love to see terrified celebrities kidnapped at gunpoint in a popular prank show while in @entity198 dance shows rule the small screen			2
the @entity182 on @entity183 begins tonight ( monday 17 june ) at 10pm on @entity10			0
