family doctors are being told to prescribe a more active sex life to patients who need to get more exercise			1
new guidelines say @entity5 should also recommend dancing and mowing the lawn as part of a drive to routinely prescribe activities			1
patients could then be called or texted by their doctor afterwards to make sure they are sticking to the advice , says the @entity13			2
but campaigners said it was no business of @entity5 to pry into the sex lives of their patients and warned that the advice risked causing offence			1
the college stated that regular activity of all kinds reduces the risk of breast cancer by 25 per cent , dementia by 30 per cent , heart disease by 40 per cent and hip fractures by 50 per cent			2
yet latest figures show that more than half of @entity44 , 56 per cent , fail to achieve the @entity23 ’s recommended minimum amount of exercise of 30 minutes , five times a week			1
and a government - commissioned report last year warned that our average activity levels were the worst in the western world and directly responsible for one in six deaths			1
lead author @entity54 , a consultant orthopaedic surgeon at @entity55 in @entity56 , said even small amounts of exercise could make a ‘ huge difference ’			2
she said that for some illnesses , exercise was just as effective as drugs including for depression where it was often prescribed instead of @entity65			0
‘ it could be as simple as taking the stairs rather than a lift , kicking a ball about with your children or grandchildren			0
‘ we ’ve got to change what we think of as normal , because what we are seeing in our hospitals and surgeries up and down the country is that normal has become not enough exercise			0
’ ‘ too many of my patients are paying the price for that with broken bones and years of ill - health that could have been avoided by being more active			0
’ the @entity13 said regular activity of all kinds reduces the risk of breast cancer by 25 per cent , dementia by 30 per cent , heart disease by 40 per cent and hip fractures by 50 per cent although gps are already urged to prescribe exercise for obese patients , the latest guidelines go further by routinely telling all patients to be more active			1
the college , which represents 220,000 doctors , suggests patients are started off gently with daily brisk walks , using the stairs , dog - walking or having more sex			2
its guidance states : ‘ many activities can be promoted ; brisk walking , cycling , climbing stairs , dog - walking , using outdoor gyms and dancing – even sexual activity can bring some benefits			0
’ professor dame @entity115 , chairman of the @entity13 , said : ‘ this is about people and their doctors believing that the small effort involved is worth it because they are worth it			0
' there really is a miracle cure staring us in the face , one which too many patients and doctors have quite simply forgotten about			1
’ but @entity129 , of @entity130 , said : ‘ it ’s none of @entity5 ’ business to be talking about patients ’ sex lives			1
i would take amiss at that and i ’m sure many others would too			0
‘ this is particularly true as nowadays most patients do n’t even know their family doctor			0

exercise is an often overlooked ' miracle cure ' , says *healthcare* body
@entity44 ' average activity levels are the worst in the western world
*critics* says it *'s* no business of @entity5 to pry into the sex lives of patients
