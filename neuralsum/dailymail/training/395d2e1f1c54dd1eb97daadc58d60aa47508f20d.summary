@entity0 have confirmed that @entity1 will miss friday 's friendly against @entity2 as a result of the civil war blighting @entity6 rugby			1
@entity1 is stuck in limbo by the ongoing dispute between the @entity9 and regions and will now miss the opening match of pre-season at @entity13			1
the @entity15 captain is the only player centrally contracted to the @entity9 and can not be selected until a new participation agreement is reached between the warring parties			1
missing : @entity1 will not play for @entity0 against @entity2 on friday the @entity0 travel to @entity18 on august 29 for their final friendly before @entity21 action begins against @entity22 nine days later			1
' until the services agreement has been sorted we unfortunately ca n't pick @entity1 and so he wo n't be involved against @entity2 , ' @entity0 attack coach @entity23 said			1
' i 've been told by the region that , at the moment , he is unable to play for us			0
' until everything is signed and sealed that will be the case			0
as soon as it is done we will crack on			0
' @entity1 's inability to play will be particularly galling given that the @entity36 star is fit and available after recovering from the shoulder injury sustained during the @entity38 in march			1
there is little evidence to suggest the @entity9 and regions will reach an agreement any time soon , so flanker @entity1 is facing the real prospect of watching the start of the competitive season from the sidelines			2
tug of war : the @entity6 captain is in the centre of a war between the @entity9 and the regions ' @entity1 is training really well with us and this is probably one of the first pre-seasons he 's had in a long while , ' @entity23 said			2
' he 's been a big part of training with us this summer so hopefully things can get sorted and he can start playing			0
' @entity1 was rehabbing with us at the start of the summer and now is back in training			0
' i know ( @entity0 defence coach ) @entity61 has spoken to ( @entity36 coach ) @entity64 about him and there is a plan in place in terms of when he can play and things like that			2
' from a rugby point of view , we hope to start integrating that plan as soon as possible			0
