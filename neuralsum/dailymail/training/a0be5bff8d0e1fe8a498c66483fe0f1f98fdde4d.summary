by @entity0 last updated at 8:29 am on 2nd december 2011 intervention : @entity3 ambassador @entity2 has made an extraordinary defence of the @entity5 in two visits to mps ahead of a crunch vote on the @entity5 on monday mps were last night urged to defy @entity3 ‘ strong - arm ’ tactics and demand a complete overhaul of the unjust @entity5			1
the @entity3 ambassador was accused of trying to railroad @entity13 into sticking with the @entity5 – even though it is plainly skewed against the rights of @entity13 citizens such as @entity18 ’s sufferer @entity19			1
@entity2 ’s unprecedented intervention came ahead of a crunch @entity24 vote on monday in which @entity9 will be given a landmark opportunity to call for a change to the law			2
he launched an extraordinary defence of the @entity5 in the course of two visits to @entity31 , attacking what he claimed were ‘ myths and inaccuracies ’ about the lopsided treaty			1
but , even as he was fighting for the @entity5 , figures emerged showing more than twice as many people have been sent to the @entity3 from @entity13 as have gone the other way			1
mr @entity2 , who personally asked to appear before two parliamentary committees , used unusually blunt language to attack critics of the @entity5 – which is being used to try to extradite mr @entity19			0
it comes ahead of a crunch @entity24 vote on monday in which @entity9 will be given a landmark opportunity to call for a change to the law			0
@entity48 has decided not to impose a three - line whip on his mps – with scores of backbenchers now expected to vote to renegotiate the 2003 @entity3 / @entity13 treaty			1
in a sign of how rattled the @entity3 have become , mr @entity2 visited mps on both wednesday and yesterday afternoon			2
campaign : @entity19 with his mother @entity57			0
the @entity3 are attempting to use the @entity5 to force him to go to @entity3 to face charges over computer hacking he told the foreign affairs committee : ‘ the constant use of skewed arguments and wilful distortion of the facts by some to advance their own agendas remains of great concern to the @entity3			2
’ in what was considered an attack on the @entity19 campaign , he added : ‘ it would be wrong to view the extradition treaty through the prism of individual cases where sentiment and emotion can cloud reality and lead to misrepresentation			0
’ campaigners point to the mountains of evidence that the treaty is unfair			0
yesterday , @entity84 mp @entity83 uncovered figures showing that , between 2004 and july 2011 , 123 people of all nationalities were extradited from @entity13 to the @entity3 during the same period , only 54 travelled in the opposite direction			1
but , in a statement which appeared to place huge pressure on mps ahead of monday ’s vote , the ambassador warned : ‘ i believe that having signed the treaty , and having had it tested both through the @entity13 justice system and by independent experts , it is now incumbent on the @entity13 government to stand in support of it			1
’ it is extremely unusual for a foreign ambassador to make an appeal to @entity13 mps over how they should vote in @entity107			1
@entity108 , of the campaign group friends extradited said : ‘ why would the @entity3 ambassador look to strong - arm the @entity13 government like this – to prevent @entity107 improving safeguards for @entity13 citizens – unless the @entity3 / @entity13 @entity115 was so blatantly favourable towards @entity3 interests ? ’ mr @entity83 , who has secured monday ’s debate , said he had asked the @entity3 for its figures on extradition but these were not available			1
he said : ‘ it is regrettable that the @entity3 ambassador is accusing @entity13 parliamentarians of a “ wilful distortion of the facts ” without a few of his own			1
’ mr @entity83 , the mp for @entity127 and @entity128 added : ‘ @entity107 must stand up and protect @entity13 citizens from arbitrary and abusive fast - track extradition			2
visit : @entity130 confirmed that mr @entity2 had spoken to his home affairs select committee ahead of the debate			0
he added that he believed that a new treaty was needed ‘ it is vital to prevent a repeat of the kind of treatment we ’ve seen @entity19 subjected to			0
’ @entity130 , a joint sponsor of monday ’s debate , confirmed his home affairs select committee had also been visited by the ambassador			0
he told the @entity144 : ‘ extradition is an issue about which many members have strong feelings			0
it is essential that members have the opportunity to air these in public			0
we need a new treaty , it ’s as simple as that			0
’ monday ’s debate calls for mps to bring forward urgent laws to change both the @entity13 / @entity159 and the hugely controversial @entity160			2
the @entity162 leadership – mindful of the fact the party signed the @entity165 in the first place – is intending to vote against change			0
however , @entity9 will not be on a three - line whip , raising the prospect of a sizeable number of its mps supporting the motion			0
@entity175 ’s @entity174 are long - standing opponents of the @entity5			0
the debate is a major breakthrough for the @entity144 ’s affront to @entity180 , which was triggered by the case of mr @entity19 , 45			0
he faces being put on a plane to the @entity3 on charges of hacking into @entity186 and @entity187 computers – even though experts say he could take his own life			2
if mps vote in favour of the demand for ‘ urgent change ’ , mr @entity48 will find himself under huge pressure to renegotiate the deal with the @entity3			1
mr @entity2 was appointed as the @entity3 ambassador to @entity13 after raising more than £ 315,000 for @entity197			1
the 73 - year - old ex-investment banker had no previous diplomatic experience			0
the major criticism of the 2003 @entity13 / @entity3 @entity5 is that it gives @entity13 citizens inferior rights compared to @entity3			1
the @entity3 can demand a @entity204 ’s extradition without having to provide any evidence – but @entity13 has to all but prove its case in a @entity3 court			1
under the @entity5 , if the @entity3 government wants to extradite a @entity13 citizen it needs only to outline the alleged offence , the punishment specified by statute and provide an accurate description of the suspect sought			1
but to extradite an @entity3 from the @entity3 , @entity13 must prove ‘ probable cause ’ – which the @entity3 @entity217 ’s fourth amendment defines as ‘ information sufficient to warrant a prudent person ’s belief that the wanted individual has committed a crime ’			1
of the ambassador , we would ask this simple question : if the treaty is meant to be fair , why not allow the wording to be changed so that @entity13 citizens have exactly the same ‘ probable cause ’ protection as their @entity3 counterparts ? the fact that he is going to extreme lengths to oppose such a change suggests that — contrary to his protests — @entity13 are undeniably getting a very raw deal			1
so it is over to our elected mps			0
@entity9 have an opportunity to send an unequivocal message to politicians on both sides of the @entity243 that our unjust extradition laws must change			0
for @entity19 ’s sake , we urge each and every one of them to take it			0
read more here in essence , @entity3 are provided a protection by their own constitution to which there is no equivalent in @entity13 law			1
the @entity3 insists that , in reality , there is no difference between the way @entity3 and @entity13 citizens are treated			2
it is simply a different legal way of expressing the same point , in order to reflect the wording of the constitution , says @entity3			2
this view was shared by sir @entity268 ’s inquiry , which has been dismissed as a whitewash			0
the puzzle is that – if the @entity3 is so adamant that its wording offers no greater protection than the @entity13 version – why not allow the treaty to be changed ? at a stroke , those facing extradition from the @entity13 could be given the same ‘ probable cause ’ defence and much of the heat would be taken out of the debate			1
the fact the @entity3 is refusing to do so rather suggests that – contrary to the denials – its citizens do have the best deal			2
it ’s worth noting that the hugely respected @entity287 entirely disagrees with the position of its own government			0
@entity287 says : ‘ we are also concerned about the threats to the rights of @entity13 people and the unfair lopsided aspect of the treaty that means that while @entity3 have basic constitutional protections requiring the establishment of probable cause before extradition can be granted , under the treaty , @entity13 residents can be subject to extradition to the @entity3 without equivalent evidentiary requirements being made out			1
’ campaigners point out that , if a @entity13 citizen is wanted by the @entity3 , he has no right to an evidential hearing in a @entity13 court			2
if a @entity3 citizen is wanted by the @entity13 , he has a constitutional right to an evidential hearing in a @entity3 magistrate ’s court .			2
