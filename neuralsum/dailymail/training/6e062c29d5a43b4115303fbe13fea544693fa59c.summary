a woman diagnosed with @entity1 after losing the ability to walk claims her symptoms were actually the result of mercury poisoning from dental fillings			1
eighteen months after @entity9 had dental treatment , doctors told the 32 - year - old she had the lifelong crippling illness multiple sclerosis			1
they warned the then 29 - year - old the condition would leave her unable to walk and prepared her for a life on medication - crushing her dreams of becoming a mother			2
but mrs @entity9 , who is from @entity19 but lives in @entity20 , is now back to full health , having had the fillings she claims were responsible , removed			1
she was unable to walk , and was suffering vision loss and weakness in her hands , but tests revealed the then 29 - year - old had mercury poisoning mrs @entity9 said she has never been in contact with mercury , other than when she had the fillings fitted			1
@entity35 said amalgam fillings , which are made of mercury mixed with silver , copper and tin , are safe to use			1
the @entity41 has paid more than £ 400,000 since 2008 to have thousands of the fillings removed from patients who have suffered an adverse reaction			1
mrs @entity9 , who married her husband @entity25 , 36 , three years ago , left her home in @entity19 for a new life in @entity20			1
but her plans for a life abroad soon came crashing down , as her health deteriorated			0
she said : ' i started to feel such a strange sensation in my body			1
' i started to have pins and needles in my legs and then it started to happen in my hands			1
just 18 months later , i could hardly walk			1
' i started having panic attacks , collapsing in the street , lost the feeling in my hands , started losing my vision , began slurring my words , i could n’t concentrate on anything			1
i could n’t grasp @entity64			0
' i experienced palpitations , and i actually could feel like my brain was moving			0
' i started having hallucinations during the night			0
i could feel my body was breaking down and not working			0
i actually thought i was dying			0
' the 32 - year - old said she ' almost died ' and urged people with @entity1 to check their symptoms are not the result of a similar poisoning the interior designer said she wants to raise awareness of the similarity between the symptoms of mercury poisoning and @entity1 , to help prevent other people going through the ordeal she endured			1
for a year , mrs @entity9 was in and out of hospital as doctors tried to establish what was wrong with her			1
in october 2012 she was diagnosed with @entity1 she said : ' i was told @entity1 was a progressive disease and that i would get sicker and i would have to inject myself with meds every day for the rest of my life and eventually be in a wheelchair			2
' i had a tearful weekend after that diagnosis			0
i felt completely alone , although my husband was great and very supportive			0
' three weeks before mrs @entity9 married her husband in @entity19 , she had several mercury fillings inserted by an @entity35 dentist			1
she claims she immediately sensed something was wrong , tasting metal in her mouth straight after the treatment			2
' i brought this to the dentist ’s attention but i was informed it was nothing to worry about , ' she said			0
' for six weeks after that , i could n’t taste my food			0
' i arrived in @entity20 and i just got sicker and sicker			2
but i refused to believe that this was the end			0
i had only just married			0
' then one day , i found the missing piece of the jigsaw			0
i discovered that mercury poisoning has the same symptoms as ms. ' i found a doctor here in @entity20 who is a metal testing doctor			1
he did various tests and they came back confirming that my body was full of mercury			2
i did indeed have mercury poisoning			1
' after contacting @entity120 , mrs @entity9 received a letter expressing sympathy for her problems , but the health authority has not admitted responsibility			1
an @entity120 spokesman , said : ' we are very sorry that mrs @entity9 has experienced health problems and the impact it has had on her life			1
' the dental treatment she received was carried out under the @entity35 general @entity133 which recognise amalgam as the material of choice for prosterior teeth			2
' we have been contacted by @entity139 and have fully investigated and responded to her complaint			0
she has also been advised of the contact details for the @entity142 should she remain unhappy with our complaint response			0
' @entity145 has for centuries been used in medicine , to make amalgams - substances formed when mercury reacts with another metal			2
they are commonly used in dentistry to create fillings , when mercury is combined with silver , tin and copper			1
those who suffer high exposure to the metal can develop mercury poisoning			1
@entity145 is a heavy metal , which in all its forms , can produce toxic effects in high enough doses			0
severe poisoning can cause kidney failure , respiratory failure , damage to the brain and lungs , and even death			0
the symptoms of mercury poisoning include : children suffering mercury poisoning may also suffer : @entity145 poisoning is also thought to be linked to mental health problems			1
in the 1800s the phrase ' @entity179 ' originated after people realised hatters , who used mercury to process felt for hats , often suffered mental health issues			2
a @entity41 spokesman added : ' the @entity41 believes that amalgam fillings are safe to use , which is a view supported by the other @entity191 health departments and the @entity192			1
' if there is a proven allergic reaction to a constituent metal of an amalgam filling which is causing oral symptoms for the patient , a consultant may recommend replacement of the amalgam fillings			1
' this is quite rare and fewer than 0.04 per cent of the 1,007,169 fillings placed in 2012 - 13 were removed on the recommendation of a consultant			2
' mrs @entity9 , said : ' i was told by @entity120 that the ombudsman can not normally look at a complaint more than 12 months after you became aware of the matter			1
' i could n’t have been in touch before that or within 12 months because i did n’t know that my ill health was due to the dental treatment i had in march 2011			2
' mrs @entity9 said she wants to raise awareness of the similarities between the symptoms of @entity1 and those of mercury poisoning			1
she said : ' it ’s very interesting and terribly sad and worrying that the highest amount of @entity1 sufferers are seemingly in the @entity191			0
' @entity145 poisoning has the same symptoms as @entity1 , so maybe many men and woman are suffering like i was and it ’s not @entity1 at all , but mercury poisoning			1
' if anyone has @entity1 , i would be asking myself the question , do they have mercury fillings and if so , get them out			1
' however , it ’s crucial that mercury fillings are removed safely and that certain natural supplements are taken before the treatment			2
' and it ’s not enough to just get the black fillings removed , you then have to do a big detox and this is best done with the help and support of a professional			2
' the 32 - year - old , who is considering pursuing a course at a holistic college in @entity247 , said she and her husband 's plans to have children are now back on track			0
she said : ' it ’s now over three years since i got sick after my dentist appointment			0
' however , i have such a big awareness now of things i knew nothing about before			0
i eat differently and it ’s now extremely important to me what i put in my body			0
' i am just so sorry i ever accepted having mercury amalgam fillings to be put in my mouth			1
if i had only known then what i know now			0
i have removed all my mercury fillings from my mouth			2
' i have done a big detox and have n’t touched any medications			0
it ’s all been natural			0
all of those dreadful @entity1 symptoms have gone			2
' there is no time i was ever exposed to mercury other than when i was at the dentist			0
' i live and love every day of my life more than i ’ve ever done			0
