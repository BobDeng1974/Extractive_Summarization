tens of thousands of families will have their benefits slashed by up to £ 60 a week under a new welfare cap , @entity4 will propose today			1
households would be unable to claim more than £ 23,000 a year in handouts for housing and living costs if the @entity9 win the next election			1
and jobless youngsters would be stripped of benefits altogether under radical plans to save £ 300million			1
the prime minister will today issue a ‘ call to arms ’ to firms to train three million youngsters in an ambitious drive to achieve ‘ full youth employment ’ within the next @entity32			1
he will argue it is vital to make ‘ difficult decisions ’ over welfare to ensure youngsters ‘ have the skills to compete with the rest of the world ’			1
on a visit to a manufacturing plant , mr @entity4 will call for every @entity43 company , as well as hundreds of smaller firms , to take on apprentices with an injection of £ 1billion in funding			1
a clutch of household names have already signed up to offer training , including the @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 and @entity58			2
many of the apprenticeships will be at ‘ advanced ’ level – equivalent to ‘ a ’ levels , and around 15,000 of them will involve paid technical training up to degree level			2
mr @entity4 will say today : ‘ because of difficult decisions we will make on welfare , we will deliver three million apprenticeships by 2020			2
this is a crucial part of our long - term economic plan to secure a better future for @entity70			0
‘ it will help give us the skills to compete with the rest of the world			0
and it will mean more hope , more opportunity , and more security for our young people , helping them get on in life and make something of themselves			0
’ reducing the welfare cap from £ 26,000 to £ 23,000 – or around £ 440 a week – will save £ 135million per year , according to details revealed last night			1
it will affect 70,000 families			1
in addition , plans announced at the @entity9 conference to strip housing benefit from jobless 18 to 21 - year - olds will affect up to 30,000 youngsters and save around £ 120million			1
@entity93 said cutting benefits would stop people from becoming trapped in poverty as @entity97 , he often finds himself up to his neck in it			2
and even away from the pressures of @entity101 , yesterday appeared to be little different for @entity102			0
the 60 - year - old minister was close to going under as he plunged into a muddy pool while tackling a gruelling 10km assault course			2
he also hauled himself up climbing ropes and crawled under barbed wire as part of the fourth annual @entity110 endurance event in @entity111			0
organisers promise the charity event will ‘ push you to the limit and beyond ’			0
officials claim the rest of the £ 300million will be saved both from the benefits bill by getting young people into work , and by reducing reliance on classroom teaching in further education in favour of on - the - job training			1
the number of apprenticeships has doubled since the @entity128 took office – to more than 200,000 a year – but they are vastly oversubscribed with eleven applicants for every place			0
chancellor @entity93 said last month that his mission in cutting benefits was to ‘ change the welfare system so it does n’t trap people in poverty and a culture of dependency ’			2
he said the reforms had forced thousands to look for work			2
only claimants of @entity143 will be exempt from the new cap			0
around 40,000 of those affected will have their benefits capped for the first time , with maximum losses of £ 60 a week			1
youngsters between 18 and 21 will be forced to live with their families unless they have a job – unless they are leaving care , are estranged from their parents or have dependent children			1
and they would be given six months to find a job or training – after which their dole would be scrapped unless they take part in ‘ community projects ’ , such as cleaning up parks			0
@entity162 supports imposing a cap on the total welfare budget , rather than per household , but says levels of housing benefit should be set per region			0
the latest jobs figures put unemployment below two million for the first time since 2008			0
a @entity52 spokesman said : ‘ apprenticeships are a crucial part of the solution to our technology skills shortage			0
’ a spokesman for the @entity178 said : ‘ we applaud the ambition to dramatically increase the number of young people gaining apprenticeships , but the training they receive must be high quality and meet the demands of businesses			0
