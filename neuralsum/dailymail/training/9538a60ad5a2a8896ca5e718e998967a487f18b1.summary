by @entity0 scientists are still struggling to explain the appearance of a giant sinkhole in the @entity4 , a remote region of @entity5 that translates as ' the @entity6 '			1
so far theories have ranged from meteorite strikes to subsurface ice , and even @entity10 , but no solid answer has yet been found			1
a research team sent to investigate the phenomenon is hoping to unearth more information about the baffling feature			2
experts are unsure what caused a giant hole in @entity19 earlier this week , found in the @entity4 which is also known as the ' @entity6 '			1
the phenomenon was revealed in incredible footage from a helicopter , a still of which is pictured here one of the more popular theories is that the giant hole was caused by a phenomenon known as a pingo , illustrated below			1
this is a subsurface accumulation of ice that has been covered by land			2
when the ice melts it can leave behind a gaping hole that it once filled			1
the other favoured theory is that the hole was caused by an explosion of methane underground			1
the @entity4 is rich in natural gas , with its resources extensively tapped by @entity5 , and a mixture of water , salt and gas could result in an explosion			1
the other theory is that it was caused by a meteorite , but most experts have ruled this possibility out as the phenomenon does not resemble normal impact craters			1
remarkable video of the hole in @entity19 was reported earlier this week			1
aerial images suggest it may be up to 260 feet ( 80 metres ) wide but has an unknown depth			0
the predominant theory so far is that the feature is a ‘ pingo , ’ reports the @entity62			1
a pingo is a large chunk of ice that is located underground that can create a hole in the ground when it melts			1
‘ certainly from the images i ’ve seen it looks like a periglacial feature , perhaps a collapsed pingo , ’ dr @entity69 of the @entity70 said			2
‘ this is obviously a very extreme version of that , and if there ’s been any interaction with the gas in the area , that is a question that could only be answered by going there			2
’ others , however , have pointed to the abundance of natural gas in the region as a possible explanation for the hole			2
' it ’s certainly mysterious , ' geologist @entity90 , president of @entity93 - based geology business @entity91 , tells @entity94			0
the exact reason behind the hole is a mystery			0
it may have been caused by a pingo , illustration shown			2
when the ice eventually melts , it can leave a gaping hole in the ground ' i do n’t think that it ’s a “ sinkhole ” , which is a phenomenon caused by the downwards collapse of the land surface into an existing cavity in the ground			1
' he also adds it 's unlikely to be a meteor strike as it ' would not leave such a deep and steep sided hole , and the impact pattern would be different			0
' @entity90 continued : ' there is a ridge of material around the edge , so this suggests some kind of “ explosion ” out of the ground			0
' the reports i ’ve seen suggest that this is not an area of volcanic activity , though			2
' most likely it was caused by the explosion of a pocket of natural gas that had accumulated near to the surface , perhaps in an existing underground cavern system , that somehow either ignited - explaining the “ scorched ” edge - or expanded until it reached some critical pressure that it blew the permafrost surface off			1
' he added that the feature was ' unique , hence all of the head scratching ! ' the region , with the hole denoted by the marker here , is known for its permafrost and pingos , which could account for the formation of this bizarre phenomenon the @entity4 is a remote region of @entity5 that is rich in natural gas , which has led some experts to suggest that the hole may have been caused by the ignition and subsequent explosion of methane underground			1
the region is also known for its reindeer , pictured here one of the more popular theories is that the giant hole was caused by a phenomenon known as a pingo			1
this is a subsurface accumulation of ice that has been covered by land			2
when the ice melts it can leave behind a gaping hole that it once filled			2
pictured is a pingo in @entity172 , @entity173 , @entity174 other experts have also cast their opinion on the phenomenon			2
' i am not really familiar with the geological and climatic setting of the “ sinkhole ” location in @entity19 , however , it does appear to be in a very cold climate area therefore it is possibly a “ pingo , ” ' sinkhole expert dr @entity186 of @entity189 's @entity188 told @entity94			1
' these features are associated with very cold glacial landscapes where groundwater lenses freeze beneath a soil cover , for example , and as more groundwater is drawn into the freezing lens of water the ground above lifts to form small conical hills hundreds of metres across and high			0
' if seasonal climate change occurs then the frozen lens of water would melt and leak away reversing the hydraulic pressure and flow of water when the pingo formed			0
' the unsupported top of such a feature could then possibly collapse to create a crater as seen			0
' alternatively the chemistry of the groundwater being drawn in to the forming pingo may change ( for example , salty water instead of fresh water ) , which could cause changes in the ice volume			0
' there is clearly much speculation going on and really it needs people on the ground investigating the particular conditions and geology present to confirm what is happening			0
' he added that ' it appears unlikely to be a true “ sinkhole ” , in other words a ground settlement or collapse over a void formed in a soluble rock such as limestone , gypsum or salt			0
' dr @entity237 also added that climate change could pose a problem , saying : ' i guess that climate change causing the atmosphere to warm would lead to a lessening of the severity of the climate in glacial areas and therefore pingo collapse might become more commonplace in such areas in time			0
' we ’ll have to wait and see ! ' the mysterious hole is in the @entity251 , which is some 20 miles ( 32 kilometres ) from the @entity253 gas field at the time some thought it may have been caused by a meteorite but predominant theories now suggest it was a ' pingo ' or explosion from the natural gas			1
pictured is the road to the @entity253 gas field @entity263 has some of the world ’s largest natural gas reserves , which has led to extensive pumping of the region			0
this caused some experts to suggest the hole could be the consequence of a giant explosion underground			1
according to the @entity273 from the @entity274 thinks a mixture of water , salt and gas could have ignited such an explosion			0
the region is geologically quite young , at about 10,000 years , and its possible gas was trapped in ice beneath the surface , but global warming has melted the ice and released the gas , like popping a champagne cork			0
a spokesman for the @entity288 , meanwhile , previously ruled out the possibility of it being a meteorite impact crater to the @entity291			0
‘ we can definitely say that it is not a meteorite			0
no details yet , ’ they said			0
experts also say that the darkening around the inner rim of the crater indicates ' severe burning ' which scorched its edges			0
the expedition currently taking place is being organised by the @entity263 authorities and includes experts from @entity5 's @entity306 of the @entity307 , and also the @entity308 of the @entity309			1
they plan to take samples of soil , air and water from the scene and they will be accompanied by a specialist from @entity5 's @entity288 in an attempt to solve the mystery once and for all .			0

experts are unsure what caused a giant hole in @entity19 earlier this week
the phenomenon was revealed in incredible footage from a helicopter
it is in the @entity4 , also known as the ' @entity6 '
at the time some thought it may have been caused by a meteorite
but predominant theories now suggest it was a ' pingo ' or explosion
a pingo is an accumulation of ice underground that melts , leaving a hole
the explosion theory is based on the abundance of gas in the area
an expedition is currently taking place to learn more about the feature
