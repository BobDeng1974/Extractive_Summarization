by @entity0 published : 18:39 est , 7 april 2013 updated : 18:54 est , 7 april 2013 proposals : police chiefs are looking to ban the naming of criminal suspects under recommendations made by @entity6 fears were growing last night that a draconian crackdown on the public ’s right to know who the police are arresting was close to being finalised			1
police chiefs are looking to ban the @entity14 and public from being told the identity of a crime suspect who has been arrested			1
the @entity18 is drawing up the plans as it considers implementing a recommendation by @entity6 in which all police forces would be banned from confirming the names of suspects to journalists			1
critics yesterday called the plan an assault on open justice and said it threatened to turn @entity30 into a ‘ banana republic ’			1
they suggested that such a move could , in theory , lead to people being arrested and locked up in secret as is the case in brutal totalitarian regimes			1
the plan for ‘ secret arrests ’ is being opposed by the @entity40 , the government ’s own adviser on law reform			1
it believes that it is in the interests of justice that the police release the names of everyone who is arrested , except in very exceptional circumstances			1
it argues that there are cases of clear public interest in which arrests should be reported , and it opposes a blanket ban on releasing names			1
@entity59 , the lawyer representing @entity61 ’s victims , said the publication of a suspect ’s name helps to encourage other potential victims to come forward			1
‘ it is difficult to strike a balance , but if someone like @entity61 ’s name is not published , victims of sexual abuse would not have the confidence to come forward , ’ he said			1
@entity73 , of @entity74 , a civil liberties organisation , said : ‘ you can very quickly find yourself in a situation where you have secret arrests			1
we have a concept of open justice			2
‘ what is being proposed is very scary because if you do not know who has been arrested or why , people can be taken off the streets without anyone knowing and the police would not be accountable or properly scrutinised			1
‘ this sort of thing happens in other countries			2
people are arrested , they disappear and no one ever knows why			1
’ under current arrangements , police release basic details of a person arrested			1
in some cases police will confirm a name to journalists , but this practice varies from force to force			2
some forces have effectively introduced the new practice in the aftermath of @entity6 ’s recommendations			0
it has led to a situation where a well - known celebrity arrested as part of @entity111 , the investigation into the @entity114 scandal , can not be named by the media , although he has been widely identified on the internet			1
the 83 - year - old was arrested on march 28 in @entity118 on suspicion of sexual offences , but the @entity120 refused to release his name to the @entity14			1
by contrast , the names of other suspects accused of historical sexual offences have been published in the @entity14 after their names were confirmed by other forces or by lawyers			2
arrest secrecy : a lawyer representing @entity61 's victims said naming criminal suspects encourages other victims to come forward members of the @entity40 and @entity18 will meet in the coming weeks in an attempt to find common ground			1
yesterday law commissioner @entity137 , @entity138 , said : ‘ it is imperative that we have confidence that our legal process is transparent			0
‘ in drafting our provisional proposals , we considered freedom of expression under the @entity146 , which covers the press ’s right to report and the public ’s right to know			0
‘ clearly this has to be balanced with an individual ’s right to privacy			0
but it is not hard to imagine cases of clear public interest in which arrests should be reported			2
’ @entity158 , chief constable of @entity159 and the lead officer on media policy for @entity18 , disagrees with the @entity40 ’s position because it does not take account of the circumstances of a suspect whose reputation was damaged by identification but who was later found to be innocent			1
he said : ‘ it is not correct to say police are looking to keep arrests secret , but rather protect the public in line with @entity6 ’s recommendations			1
‘ a member of the public could be arrested and then have no further action taken against them			2
‘ an arrest does not mean someone is guilty and their release might not achieve the same publicity			0
‘ there will most likely be exceptions to this in the interests of justice and to prevent and detect crime			0
we are still in the process of drafting guidance and we are still talking to a range of parties and any decision will have to be approved with the @entity194			0
’ campaigner : @entity196 , head of @entity197 , was accused of giving false evidence to the @entity199 a staunch supporter of press regulation gave false evidence on oath to the @entity199 , it was claimed yesterday			0
@entity205 , head of @entity197 , a group campaigning against ‘ inaccuracy in the media ’ , told @entity6 that his organisation was ‘ constituted as a charity , and in the process of registering as a charity ’			2
he went on to say it operated ‘ under a statutory public benefit obligation ’			0
@entity6 drew extensively on @entity197 ’s evidence in his report , calling its work ‘ extremely important ’			0
he wrote : ‘ i am pleased to recognise that @entity197 can claim to be one of the organisations that does seek to “ guard the guardians ”			0
’ its submissions went to the ‘ very core of what i ’ve had to consider ’			0
however , seven months before mr @entity196 testified , @entity197 had been refused registration as a charity , according to the @entity226			0
in july 2011 a charity tribunal judge heard that @entity197 lacked the ‘ requisite objectivity ’ and was not ‘ established for the public benefit ’ , it was said			0
the judge denied the organisation charitable status , saying it was too political			0
mr @entity196 , 29 , is also a director of @entity233 , a pressure group leading the campaign for press regulation			0
@entity197 claims to specialise in exposing journalists who it says are ‘ playing tricks with the truth ’			0
it says the media ’s ‘ inaccuracy ’ proves that the press must ‘ be subject to additional constraints ’			2
however @entity243 , the @entity245 mp and former cabinet minister , who opposes state - backed press regulation , said : ‘ they do not seem to hold themselves to the standards they demand for others			2
’ mr @entity196 said : ‘ the position we gave is correct			0
i do n’t think we misled @entity6 and i do n’t think he will have felt misled			0
’ he added that @entity197 had not given up trying to register as a charity .			0
