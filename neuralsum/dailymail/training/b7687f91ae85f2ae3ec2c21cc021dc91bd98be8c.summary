@entity0 is always a gamble - there 's a fine line between comedy genius and complete social disaster			1
fortunately for us , despite years and years of practice , there will always be those who never get it quite right			2
whether it 's the parents trying to save a few quid by making the costumes out of bin liners , or the others who try and recycle a @entity18 costume , there are plenty of dodgy photos floating around in cyberspace			0
as the country gears up to celebrate @entity0 , @entity26 features some of the most embarrassing attempts at costumes over the years in other photo - friendly families , the urge to get a deal on a job lot of matching fancy dress proved too tempting			1
or there are the mothers and fathers who were tempted to create a real pumpkin costume for their baby as a last minute solution			0
video courtesy of @entity43 thankfully , those involved have seen the funny side afterwards and many have shared their pictures for others to see			0
we 've done a round - up of some of the best from @entity53 so the rest of the world can share in the laughs			0
do you have a eye - poppingly cringe - worthy family picture that you 'd like to share ? email us your photo and story @entity59 it 's hardly any surprise this baby looks shocked - no matter how long you stare at the picture , you wo n't be able to decide if this man only wore this costume for @entity0 farmyard fun , or is it ? none of their smiles reach the eyes this man paid a visit to his grandmother before heading on to a @entity76 , he may have borrowed a spare pair of tights in case of laddering too ever wondered what you 're going to look like when you grow up ? just take a look at your mother when the furniture looks spookier than you , it 's a definite @entity0 fail the woman in the middle might be dressed as a candlestick , but hopefully nobody lit a real match near this lot @entity0 makes people do some odd things			1
no wonder the woman at the back is trying to hide if you 've tried this hard to make your @entity0 costumes work , you must 've known people would want a photo it 's hard to tell if the child is crying about the costume or the prospect of being boiled alive credit goes to this woman for going the extra mile with her @entity0 photoshoot			2
hopefully this was after she returned home from the party , not beforehand this mummy costume would definitely have won first prize in the fancy dress competition , if only the child could have got to the venue you 're never too old for @entity0 , although even the man on the tv in the background appears to be questioning the silver bra this family did n't hold back on the cost of their costumes , so much so that there was no money left for the child you know you 've got a strong @entity0 costume when you 're the focal point in this room there will always be one child who is forced to wear the @entity18 fancy dress for @entity0 nobody could accuse these two of laziness with the outfits it does n't seem like either of these two are up for a night of crime - fighting these children were going for the sympathy votes on the trick or treat rounds yep , we 're all thinking what you 're thinking the little girl on the left has every right to be looking that smug the floating baby could well be the best @entity0 costume of all time we 're not even really sure if this is @entity0 choosing a pumpkin is meant to be fun did they run out of tin foil ?			1

@entity0 is always a gamble between comedy genius and social disaster
