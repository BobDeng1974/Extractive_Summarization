finding : being able to hear the tick - tock of a clock makes women quicken their desire to marry and have children , according to a new @entity6 study it is often said that women have an internal biological clock			1
but it seems the mere sound of the seconds ticking away can make them focus more on their fertility			0
a study found that being able to hear the tick - tock of a clock makes women quicken their desire to marry and have children			1
the subtle reminder that their fertility is finite may also lead to them lowering their expectations and settling for what they perceive to be a less successful man			1
researchers said that the idea that a woman ’s urge and ability to have a child are controlled by a biological clock is deeply engrained as such , females may unconsciously associate a ticking sound with their childbearing years slipping away			2
the @entity6 researchers completed two experiments to test the influence of the ticking of a small clock on men and women ’s reproductive attitudes			1
in the first , 59 men and women were asked questions about the age at which they would like to marry and start a family			1
in the second experiment , they were quizzed on the qualities they look for in husband or wife			0
they were also asked about how financially secure their childhood was			0
those women whose parents were poor were influenced by the ticking sound			0
the tick - tock led to them wanting to have children earlier and to place less emphasis on a man ’s social status and earning power			1
while it might seem odd that the women ’s childhood had an effect , previous studies have shown that a person ’s childhood affects how they act as an adult			0
in particular , those from rich and poor backgrounds can react very differently			0
the study , published in the journal @entity78 , also found that women whose parents were well - off became choosier about a mate when they could hear time ticking away			2
' engrained ' : researchers said the idea that a woman 's ability to have a child is controlled by a biological clock is deeply engrained			2
so , females may associate a ticking sound with their childbearing years slipping away interestingly , men ’s attitude towards settling down and having a family was n’t influenced by the ticking clock			1
the @entity98 researchers said : ‘ women ’s reproductive capacity is strongly constrained by their age			0
‘ unlike men , who can produce offspring until a very old age , women lose their ability to conceive children at menopause			2
‘ subtle clues that signal the passage of time – such as the perception of a ticking clock – may signal threats to a woman ’s reproductive potential			0
