news of the donation comes just days after @entity4 unveiled plans to cap private rents – a policy long demanded by @entity9			1
@entity23 money : @entity6 ( left ) has accepted £ 1.8million from @entity3 's @entity9 union @entity26 chairman @entity25 said the huge gift was proof that , whatever mr @entity6 claims , his party is still in hock to the unions			1
the figures , from the @entity32 , show that 75 per cent of the donations in the first quarter of this year came from unions			1
‘ @entity6 said he ’d stand up to his union paymasters like @entity3 – but he ’s failed and broken his promise , ’ said mr @entity25			1
‘ @entity6 is too weak to stand up to his union bosses and that means he ’s too weak to stand up for @entity40			0
‘ @entity23 bosses are still in the driving seat at @entity43			0
they are holding the purse strings , selecting the candidates and picking the policies			0
' we all know what this means - more borrowing , more spending and more taxes hitting families across the country			0
’ the commission figures show @entity4 lagging well behind the @entity8 in raising money , with less than a year to go until the general election			2

however , the @entity26 raked in £ 6.6million during the same period			2
@entity4 said the figures include only donations of £ 7,500 or more			1
a spokesman said that once small donations and party membership fees are included , union gifts make up only 32 per cent of the total			2
party fees account for 35 per cent			0
‘ we welcome the unions ’ support but it would be wrong to suggest that in any way it gains them undue influence over policy or that they are the sole source of the party ’s funding , ’ said the spokesman			2
the figures were released as @entity88 , @entity4 ’s former election coordinator , admitted that the party is having a ‘ judder ’ amid dismal poll ratings , and that some in the party ‘ predict disaster ’ for mr @entity6			1
the former minister pulled no punches about the mood of some in the party but , writing on a @entity4 website , he urged activists to be ‘ cheerful ’ ahead of local and @entity101 elections next week			1
he said @entity103 supporters were usually won over when they found out about the party ’s policies , including a flat rate of tax for everyone from bankers to cleaners , and proposals to break up the @entity112			0
@entity4 can also bank on a collapse in the @entity116 vote and having more activists than the @entity26 , he said			1

a controversial @entity26 donor has given £ 1.5million to the party just months after being granted a knighthood			1

many of them are hedge fund managers			0
@entity4 claims that the @entity153 has brought in £ 145million of tax cuts for hedge funds			2
