school safety experts have reported a ' worrying increase ' in e-terrorism , where threats are sent electronically - sometimes from thousands of miles away			1
the @entity5 - based @entity4 and @entity6 reviewed more than 800 school threats covered in the media during the first half of the 2014 - 15 academic year			1
researchers found that about one - third of cases involved violent remarks sent anonymously via text message , social media , email or other online means			1
law enforcement officers say the use of the modern technologies has made it much harder to determine if a threat is real and to find the culprit			0
worrying trend : in this january 13 , 2014 photo , students pass by @entity26 after being evacuated for the day after a bomb squad was called to remove a potentially explosive device in many cases , swift action is taken with lockdowns and evacuations			1
however , authorities say the majority of the time threats turn out to be hoaxes			2
indeed , just this week a 16 - year - old from @entity38 in @entity39 , @entity40 , was arrested for posting about a bomb threat on @entity42 because ' she was angry and did not want to go to school , ' according to the @entity44			1
complicating matters , the threats are n't just coming from within school walls or even a school 's neighborhood			1
last fall , @entity50 in @entity51 , @entity52 , was placed in lockdown and police responded after an email purportedly from the @entity57 group demanded ransom money and threatened to ' shoot and kill ' every @entity59 , according to a police report			0
a 14 - year - old student was arrested after admitting the email had been sent by her online friend ' @entity63 ' after she told him to ' swat ' her school because she thought it would be funny , police said			1
anonymous : law enforcement officers say the use of the modern technologies has made it that much harder to determine if a threat is real and to find the culprit ( stock photo ) ' swatting ' plays off the idea of issuing a threat that draws a swat team in response , disrupting activities at the target of the threat			0
it appears to have originated with pranksters in the online gaming community			2
in a separate case , a 14 - year - old in western @entity85 was ordered by a judge to pay nearly $ 8,000 in restitution to the @entity89 and the @entity90 for his involvement in a swatting incident that put schools in lockdown after a caller using computer - based technology made threats against the schools			1
authorities say the call was made by a person code - named ' @entity102 , ' whom the teen had met online			1
' @entity102 ' is believed to live in the @entity104 and is suspected in a string of similar incidents from coast to coast , according to law enforcement			0
' he will learn from this , ' the teen 's father said , according to the @entity112 in @entity85			0
the motivations of the threat makers vary , just as they did a generation ago when bomb threats were called in by pay phone : avoiding a test , revenge or simply to show off			2
with swatting , a motivation appears to be thrill - seeking , said capt. @entity121 with the @entity90			2
it 's not too difficult for students to figure out how to pull off such an incident , said @entity125 , a computer science professor at @entity126 who studies cybersecurity			0
' you wander to the wrong parts of the @entity130 and you can learn how to do it and not get caught , ' @entity125 said			0
with each incident , there 's a risk when authorities respond , said detective @entity136 , a digital forensics expert with the @entity138 in @entity52 who has been investigating a bomb threat case against a school in his community			2
' they could inadvertently get hurt when police are just trying to do their jobs based on the best information that they have , ' he said			0
applications such as @entity150 , @entity151 , @entity152 , @entity153 and @entity154 also have been used by students to make threats anonymously			1
in @entity85 , superintendent @entity157 of the @entity158 wrote to parents in december informing them about a posting on afterschool that said , ' bringing a @entity162 to @entity26			0
' the posting had been brought to the high school principal 's attention by a text message ; police quickly determined that it was not a credible threat			1
' i encourage you to ask you child to stop using this app and remove it from their phone , ' @entity157 said			0
every threat has to be taken seriously even though in most cases the called - in danger is not real , said @entity178 , superintendent of schools in @entity179 , @entity180 , and president of the @entity182			2
meanwhile , social media and other electronic means of communication are keeping parents informed about threats			1
mindful of past school shootings , they are demanding that children be pulled out of school even as school and law enforcement officials investigate			0
' the security of people has been greatly eroded in this country , as you know , just through awful things that have happened , ' said @entity199 , deputy superintendent at the @entity200 .			0
