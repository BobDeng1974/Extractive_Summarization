thousands of new mothers are being let down by inadequate gp appointments that are supposed to ensure they recover well from labour , a study has found			1
nearly half said their six - week post-natal check was not thorough enough , with one in five saying it lasted less than five minutes			1
almost a third ( 29 per cent ) claimed their gp did not ask about their state of mind , even though doctors are meant to check for post-natal depression			1
the consultations are offered on the @entity23 six weeks after labour to check that women are recovering physically and emotionally , and coping with caring for their babies			2
@entity27 are meant to weigh women , check their blood pressure , test their urine for kidney infections and ask a series of questions about their wellbeing			1
but a survey of 4,000 new mothers by the @entity37 found 45 per cent thought the checks were substandard			1
another 43 per cent said their gp did not understand their circumstances and 7 per cent wanted to talk about how they were coping emotionally but ran out of time			2

' another , @entity55 , from @entity56 , said : ' there was no consideration of the difficult labour i had gone through and impact it may have had on me psychologically			0
' @entity37 chief executive @entity61 said : ' the check - up is a key opportunity to spot potential problems			1
post-natal depression can develop from this stage , as well as other physical and psychological disorders			2
' so it is worrying that almost a third of women were not even asked about how they felt			0
identification early on is crucial			0
' common problems that should be picked up include difficulty in shedding pregnancy weight , or going too far the other way and developing eating disorders as mums try to regain their figure			0
the checks are also an invaluable opportunity for mothers to admit they are struggling with breastfeeding , or seek advice on how to settle their baby			1
@entity85 , editor in chief of the website @entity87 , said : ' the check is a vital safety net , but this system is n't working			0
investing a little more time and money could pick up serious emotional and psychological issues much earlier , saving the @entity23 millions in treatment costs later			0
