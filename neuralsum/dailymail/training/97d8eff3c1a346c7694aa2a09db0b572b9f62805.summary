by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 12:15 est , 15 february 2013 updated : 21:04 est , 15 february 2013 a scrabble - loving grandmother is poised to become a bestselling author after compiling a list of high - scoring ‘ wicked wee words ’			1
@entity6 , 76 , spent five years creating the list of little - known three - letter words , which include such examples as zek , pyz , and zho			1
these gems may be unfamiliar from everyday @entity12 , but they can reward players with up to 19 points – or far more if they are placed on squares giving double or triple scores for letters or words			2
loves letters : scrabble enthusiast @entity6 , 75 , sets up some of the high scoring three letter words she has compiled for her list mrs @entity6 , who has three grandchildren , began writing her favourite high - scoring words down in a notepad to help her remember them for fortnightly games at her pensioners ’ group			1
but word got round about mrs @entity6 ’s secret weapon and soon all her opponents were asking for a copy			1
at first she would print out the list for friends			2
now mrs @entity6 's list is to be published in a book ' wicked @entity36 ' however , it became so popular that eventually her printer broke down after it could take no more			1
it was then that mrs @entity6 sought out a publisher – and to her delight they snapped up her compilation			1
the book is entitled @entity45 : for @entity46			2
with millions of @entity51 players across the world , the book – published in paperback and as an e-book – is well - placed to be a bestseller on @entity54			2
the retired pharmacy technician from @entity56 , @entity57 , said : ‘ the book was a valuable tool for me and my friends but i am just glad that it will be a tool for every other @entity51 player too			2
’ mrs @entity6 , who lives with husband @entity63 , uses the same @entity51 set that she bought in 1963 to play			1
the mother - of - three said : ‘ i love @entity51 and have played it for as long as i can remember			2
‘ i started off with lists of words at home just for fun			2
' my memory is not what it used to be			0
i often find a brilliant word and think " i ’m going to remember that " but i often do n’t and this solves that problem			0
the book was a valuable tool for me and my friends but i ’m just glad it will be a tool for every other @entity51 player too			0
' to be honest i only win as many games as i lose and i ’m not the greatest @entity51 player in the world			0
for me its all about the enjoyment of playing the game			1
the most important thing if you want to win a game is a good night ’s sleep the night before			0
show off : ms @entity6 racks up the high - scoring word ' @entity90 ' which , just in case you were wondering , is the amino acid radical or residue of glycine ' initially i was printing out long lists of words for friends at home but i had so many requests that my printer gave up the ghost in the end			1
' when another one broke i just thought i would see if i could get the list published as a book and a publisher said they would take it			1
' i ’m quite old to have just published my first book but it is a thrill seeing the finished article			0
it was a bit of fun and i enjoyed compiling it even though i ’m not a creative writer			0
@entity116 ( 19 ) - another word for ejaculation @entity119 ( 19 ) - a tool similar to a hatchet @entity124 ( 16 ) - @entity123 camp slang for prisoner @entity127 ( 15 ) - alternative spelling of fizz @entity129 ( 15 ) - a type of hat from @entity132 @entity133 ( 15 ) - a church receptacle @entity135 ( 15 ) - a gifted person @entity137 ( 14 ) - to destroy or obliterate @entity138 ( 14 ) - an occupation or line of work @entity142 ( 14 ) - a type of plant ' i have no idea if it will sell well but @entity51 is as popular as ever , particularly in @entity147 , and i have got an @entity147 publisher			0
' we love @entity51 in our family and all of my friends love playing			0
but it is aimed at older players who might get a little bit forgetful - just like like me			0
' ‘ i liked writing down just short words but ones that scored very high			1
they ’re often very difficult to remember			0
i spent ages recording all the little words i could use			0
eventually my friends could see i was using the list and they wanted one too			0
’ unlike other @entity51 dictionaries , her book is searchable by any letter in a word , rather than just the first letter			0
focusing on short words that can be added to others on the board , it could be a vital tactical weapon for players			1

@entity6 , 76 , has been playing the board game for *70* years
would come up with words but kept forgetting them when she played again
began writing them down and her list has now been turned into a new book
