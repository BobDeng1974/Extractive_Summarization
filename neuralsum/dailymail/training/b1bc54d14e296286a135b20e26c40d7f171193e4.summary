a country life may sound idyllic , but experts have found a possible link between rural living and parkinson 's disease			2
analysis of more than 100 studies from around the world shows that exposure to pesticides , bug and weed killers and solvents is associated with a higher risk of developing @entity4			1
study author , dr @entity14 , said : ' due to this association , there was also a link between farming or country living and developing @entity20 's in some of the studies			2
' exposure to chemicals associated with country has been linked to an increased risk of @entity20 's disease researchers from the @entity28 in @entity29 , @entity30 , reviewed studies that looked at weed , fungus , rodent or bug killers , and solvents in relation to the risk of developing @entity4			1
proximity to these chemicals , due to country living , occupation and drinking water were also evaluated			2
the research found that being exposed to bug or weed killers and solvents increased the risk of developing @entity4 by 33 to 80 per cent			1
in controlled studies , exposure to the weed killer paraquat or the fungicides maneb and mancozeb was associated with twice the risk of developing the disease			1
@entity20 's is a chronic neurological disorder due a to deficiency in dopamine dr @entity14 added : ' we did n't study whether the type of exposure , such as whether the compound was inhaled or absorbed through the skin and the method of application , such as spraying or mixing , affected @entity20 's risk			1
' however , our study suggests that the risk increases in a dose response manner as the length of exposure to these chemicals increases			1
' @entity4 is a chronic neurological disorder , characterised by a deficiency of dopamine			2
this affects the way the brain co-ordinates the movements of the muscles in different parts of the body			0
the disease mainly develops in the over 50s			0
about 5 in 1,000 people in their 60s , and about 40 in 1,000 people in their 80s have the condition			0
the main symptoms are slowness of movement , stiffness of muscles and shaking			0
these tend to slowly worsen with time although the rate varies from patient to patient			0
there is currently no cure			0
the research appears in the journal @entity99 .			0

@entity30 researchers looked at studies involving exposure to weed , fungus , rodent or bug killers and solvents
results showed risk increased by 33 to 80 per cent
study suggests the risk is *dependent* on the dose and length of exposure to certain chemicals
