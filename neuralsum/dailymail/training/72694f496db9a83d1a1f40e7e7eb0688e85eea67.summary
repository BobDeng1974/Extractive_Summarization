if you have ever watched a child using an @entity2 with expertise eclipsing that of some adults , you may be forgiven for thinking young people are more tech savvy than ever before			1
but one engineer has dubbed young people a ‘ lost generation ’ , incapable of fixing gadgets and appliances because they have grown up in a disposable world			1
@entity12 from @entity13 said people under the age of 40 expect gadgets to ‘ just work ’ and consequently are useless if they go wrong , replacing them with new devices instead of mending them			1
lost generation : electronics engineer professor @entity12 ( pictured ) said that people under the age of 40 expect gadgets to ‘ just work ’ and consequently are useless if they go wrong , replacing them with new devices instead of mending them the professor of @entity25 is giving this year ’s prestigious @entity26 in @entity27			1
she claims most devices can be mended or repurposed with just a little knowledge of engineering and electronics and hopes to inspire television viewers who watch her lectures called : ‘ @entity34 will fly : how to hack your home ’ to make , do and mend			1
in the lecture series , beginning tonight at 8pm on @entity38 , professor @entity37 will examine three @entity41 inventions - the light bulb , a telephone and a motor			1
she will then show viewers how to transform them into extraordinary things , using everyday objects , as well as 3d printers , new materials and coding			0
the light bulb moment : airs tonight , december 29 , at 8pm pm @entity38 professor @entity12 will attempt to play a computer game on the windows of a skyscraper using hundreds of light bulbs			1
she explain how this is possible and show viewers how to send wireless messages using a barbecue , control a firework display with their your laptop and use a torch to browse the internet			0
making contact : airs on december 30 at 8pm , @entity38 inspired by @entity69 , professor @entity37 will try to beam a special guest into the theatre via hologram , using the technology found in a mobile phone			1
she will show viewers how to control paintball cannons with a webcam and turn their smartphone into a microscope , while also investigating a device that allows people to feel invisible objects in mid-air			2
a new revolution : airs on december 31 at 8pm , @entity38 dr @entity37 will attempt to use simple motors to build a worldclass robot orchestra			2
she will explain how these robotic and motor - driven appliances work and show how they can adapted to help us kick start a technological revolution as well as showing viewers how to turn a washing machine into a wind turbine , how @entity95 can solve a @entity96 and how the next @entity98 rover will traverse an alien world			0
professor @entity37 told @entity100 : ‘ we ’ve got a lost generation that has grown up with factory electronics that just work all of the time			1
‘ all of these things in our home do seem to work most of the time and because they do n’t break we just get used to them			0
the professor giving this year ’s prestigious @entity26 has dubbed young people a ‘ lost generation ’ who are incapable of fixing gadgets and appliances , because they have grown up in a disposable world			1
a pile of broken computer parts is pictured professor @entity12 is an @entity119 in the @entity120 at the @entity13 and a professor of @entity25			1
her first degree was in @entity123 and she then did a masters in @entity125 and phd in @entity127			0
she was a senior electrical engineer at @entity128 until 2006			2
professor @entity37 first became interested in engineering when she was given a telescope by her parents aged eight			1
' i would get up in the middle of the night to watch lunar eclipses			0
it was the first time i realised how mathematics and physics could be used in a practical and useful way and i knew immediately that this kind of hands - on investigation was what i wanted to do in life , ' she said			0
she now focuses on designing , testing and constructing instrumentation used in radio frequency and microwave communications systems by helping to design devices that transmit and receive huge volumes of information using radio waves , which is how mobile phones operate , or the much shorter microwaves , which is how satellite and deep space communications work			2
she is following in the footsteps of @entity157 and @entity158 by giving the @entity26			0
‘ they have almost become like @entity160 which never die			0
' and when they do we throw them away and buy something new			2
’ however , she said there is an emerging community of people that enjoy remaking and repurposing things , such as a man who uses leds on his bike to write messages to motorists			2
she hopes young people will realise that they can change the world by inventing new devices			1
and there has never been a better time , because technology is improving at an incredible rate and many components and gadgets are relatively cheap , she added			2
' today ’s generation of young people are in a truly unique position			1
they have never been more equipped to be creative and innovative , ' she said in a blog post			0
' i want young people to realise that they have the power to change the world from their own bedroom , kitchen table or garden shed			2
' if we all take control of the technology around us and think creatively , then solving some of the world ’s greatest challenges is only a small step away			0
' i believe everyone has the potential to be an inventor			0
' it was a present of a telescope from her parents at the age of eight that first made professor @entity37 appreciate how maths and physics can be used in a practical way			1
@entity213 , director of science and education at the @entity26 said : ‘ our aim is to bring to life the incredible ingenuity , innovation and creativity of engineering			0
’ the lectures , which were started in 1825 by @entity157 , have been taken by scientists including astronomer @entity223 and sir @entity158			0
professor @entity37 's first lecture , which is inspired by @entity226 inventor @entity225 who is most famous for inventing the incandescent light bulb , will see her playing a computer game on the windows of a skyscraper using hundreds of light bulbs			1
she will also show viewers how to send wireless messages using a barbecue , control a firework display with a laptop			0
and use a torch to browse the internet			0
in following lectures , she will attempt to beam a holographic special guest to the theatre in @entity27 , using a smartphone , and use simple motors to make a robot orchestra			0
other ‘ how - tos ’ will include how to turn a washing machine into a wind turbine , how @entity95 can solve a @entity96 , and how the next @entity98 rover will traverse an alien world			0
the first of this year ’s lectures airs tonight on @entity38 at 8pm , with three more following until @entity253			2
despite saying most people under the age of 40 have n't got a clue how to fix electronic devices and appliances , she said there is an emerging community of people that enjoy remaking and repurposing things and will show how coding ( illustrated ) and new technologies can be used to invent new objects , in her lecture			1

professor @entity12 , of the @entity13 will give this year 's @entity271
she hopes to inspire young people to fix and invent electrical devices
professor @entity37 thinks most under 40s ca n't mend their gadgets
this is because they *'ve* grown up in a disposable *society* , meaning they simply buy new devices rather than fix the old ones
