@entity0 has been handed the dubious chance to resurrect his athletics career after being sentenced to what could be as little as 10 months ’ imprisonment for shooting his girlfriend dead			1
although @entity0 was sentenced to five years for the manslaughter of 29 - year - old model @entity9 , his own legal team said he need serve only one sixth of the term behind bars			1
the double amputee could then be placed under house arrest at his uncle @entity15 ’s mansion — a former rectory — on @entity18 in @entity19 , a plush @entity20 suburb that housed @entity22 grandees in the apartheid years			0
@entity25 police escort @entity0 ( left ) to prison in the back of an armoured vehicle @entity0 is led to the police van after leaving the @entity30 to be taken to jail @entity0 pictured in november 2012 with girlfriend @entity9 , who he shot dead in their home unlike the cell at @entity20 ’s main prison where @entity0 spent last night , the high walls and electric fences at his uncle ’s house are there to keep the criminals out			1
some legal experts said @entity0 would be allowed to leave the house to train and possibly to compete			1
click here to read the full timeline of events in the case that stunned sport however , the @entity49 told @entity50 that the athlete could not run in their competitions until 2019 , when his full five - year term will have elapsed			0
an @entity49 spokesman confirmed : ‘ it is 2019 as far as we are concerned			0
the only way that could change is if he successfully appealed against the judgment			0
’ that means @entity0 will miss the @entity61 in 2016 , but could be free to take part in @entity63 four years later			1
@entity0 hands his watch to his uncle , @entity65 , as he is led down to the cells of the court the athlete turns to leave the dock after learning that he will serve a maximum of five years in prison by then he would be 33 — a year older than @entity72 when he won the 100 metres gold medal at the @entity74			1
neither the @entity75 — the governing body of athletics — nor the @entity78 would comment on the sporting implications of tuesday 's sentencing by judge @entity81			0
the @entity78 limited themselves to saying the case was a ‘ human tragedy for the family of @entity9 and also for @entity0 ’ and that they ‘ hope time will bring comfort to all those concerned ’			1
regardless of eligibility , @entity0 is unlikely to compete against able - bodied opponents again			1
it was remarkable that he did so in the first place at @entity93			0
then he was in his mid- 20s , and a repeat effort may now be beyond his mental and physical capabilities			0
@entity0 stands in the dock as his sentence is delivered at the high court in @entity20 on tuesday @entity0 , who was impassive as he stood to hear the sentence , is said by his management to think it too early to contemplate a return to the track			2
a disincentive to competing again — apart from the opprobrium that he would face — is the impossibility of ever earning anything like as lavishly as he did when he wore a halo : the back jacket of his autobiography hailed him ‘ one of the most inspirational figures on the planet — from immobilised child to world - class sprinter ’			0
at his peak @entity0 earned £ 300,000 from athletics and a further £ 1million from sponsorship annually			1
he had a £ 450,000 property portfolio , including the marble - floored bachelor pad on @entity20 ’s guarded @entity121 — the house in which he killed @entity9 with four shots through the bathroom door on february 14 last year			2
the ' @entity0 ' made history at @entity93 by becoming the first amputee to run at the @entity128 @entity0 runs during the 100m @entity129 round 1 at the 2012 paralympics at the @entity131 in @entity132 @entity0 has since sold all his houses and cars to pay his legal bills			1
his defence team called him ‘ broke and broken ’			0
deals with @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity140 and @entity142 designers @entity143 have all long stopped			0
however , his family ’s wealth from mineral mining means he is probably not destitute			0
the @entity147 , who charged @entity0 with premeditated murder , have 14 days to decide whether to appeal			2
but june @entity9 , the victim ’s mother , seemed to have had enough , saying : ‘ i ’m just so glad it ’s over			2
’ @entity65 , whose hands @entity0 clasped as he was led away at @entity30 , spoke for his family and nephew : ‘ we accept the judgment , ’ he said			2
‘ @entity0 will embrace the opportunity to pay back society			2

@entity0 sentenced to five years in prison for killing @entity9
athlete could serve as little as 10 months in jail say legal team
@entity25 wo *n't* be allowed to compete in @entity165 , but could take part in @entity167
but @entity0 unlikely to receive sponsorship again
