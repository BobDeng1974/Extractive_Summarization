following @entity3 's @entity2 announcement last week , the company has now updated its @entity5 software to add the hands - free options to iphones and @entity9			1
@entity3 is selling the product as a ' smarter , safer and more fun way to use an @entity12 in the car ' because it uses @entity15 voice commands to control entertainment and other in - car features - but safety campaigners are not convinced			1
researchers from @entity20 recently found that using voice controls to send text messages while driving - on software including @entity24 - is just as dangerous as texting with fingers			2
@entity3 's @entity2 uses @entity15 voice commands to control entertainment and other in - car features			1
researchers from @entity20 recently found that using voice controls to send text messages while driving - on software including @entity3 's @entity15 - is just as dangerous as texting with fingers the @entity33 's results confirm the recent findings from the @entity20 at @entity35			1
in april last year , @entity37 researchers found that using voice to send text messages while driving - on software such as @entity3 's @entity15 - is just as dangerous as texting with fingers			1
they found both methods impacted driver response times equally - but it often took voice recognition users longer to fix mistakes with their messages			0
@entity3 announced its @entity2 system last week after adding eyes - free technology to its @entity5 software last year			1
it updated the @entity5 software yesterday to make the @entity2 functions more widely available			0
a car equipped with the @entity2 technology lets a user connect their handset to the system and use their car 's built - in display and controls			1
the @entity63 - free tool lets users without @entity66 - compatible cars control the system in a similar , using voice commands			1
while a separate study from the @entity33 in the @entity70 , discovered that hands - free kits increase mental workload and distractions , causing reaction times to get slower and brain function to become compromised			2
this results in drivers scanning the road less and potentially not seeing items right in front of them , including pedestrians			0
cognitive distraction expert @entity84 and his research team at the @entity87 measured brainwaves , eye movement and other metrics to assess what happens to drivers ’ mental workload when they attempt to do multiple things at once			2
mr @entity84 fitted cars with mounted cameras that tracked the eye and head movement of drivers			0
a @entity99 device known as the ' @entity99 ' was used to record driver reaction time in response to triggers of red and green lights added to their field of vision			0
a special electroencephalographic ( @entity108 ) - configured skull cap was also fitted to the drivers ' head and was used to track the participants ’ brain activity so that researchers could determine mental workload			2
to measure the distractions , drivers were played an audio book			0
there brainwaves were also measured while they talked on the phone and while they listened to telephone conversations			2
the drivers were then monitored while voice - activated emails were played to them directly from their handset			2
@entity125 , right , from the @entity33 is fitted with an electroencephalographic ( @entity108 ) - configured skull cap by @entity128 , research assistant professor of psychology at @entity130 , left			0
the caps were fitted to drivers to measure their brainwaves and determine the risk posed by voice - activated technology drivers ' brainwaves were monitored while they talked on the phone and while voice - activated emails were played to them , in a system similar to that used in @entity3 's @entity2 , pictured			1
talking on a phone resulted in a moderate risk , but listening to voice - activated features was classed as an extensive risk researchers used the results of these tests to rate the levels of mental distraction drivers experienced while performing each task			1
these levels of mental distraction were represented on a scale , similar to the @entity153 used for hurricanes			0
tasks such as listening to the radio ranked as a category 1 level of distraction and were rated as a minimal risk			2
talking on a phone , both handheld and hands - free , resulted in a category 2 , moderate risk			1
surprisingly , listening and responding to in - vehicle , voice - activated email features increased mental workload and distraction levels of the drivers to a @entity153 - and was classed as an extensive risk			1
some 35 per cent of drivers admit to reading a text or email while driving in any given month , while 26 percent admitted to typing one , according to data from @entity33			0
@entity125 , pictured , had his brainwaves monitored while listening to his emails being read aloud to him from his phone			2
his mental workload increased and his reaction times were slower			0
researchers from the @entity33 concluded that voice - activated technologies pose an ' extensive risk ' to drivers @entity187 @entity186 software already has a special ' car mode ' , shown here , which lets users access commonly used functions via large buttons ' there is a looming public safety crisis ahead with the future proliferation of these in - vehicle technologies , ' said @entity33 president and ceo @entity197			1
' it ’s time to consider limiting new and potentially dangerous mental distractions built into cars , particularly with the common public misperception that hands - free means risk - free			1
' @entity33 presidents and ceo @entity204 added : ' these findings reinforce previous research that hands - free is not risk - free			1
; ' increased mental workload and cognitive distractions can lead to a type of tunnel vision or inattention blindness where motorists do n’t see potential hazards right in front of them			0
' as well as @entity3 's @entity15 , other voice - activated technology include the joyride app that lets you play trivia games using your voice , while driving			1
voice - activated assistant app @entity222 is also built into some @entity224 models			0
@entity187 's @entity186 software has voice - controls and a special ' car mode ' that allows users to access commonly used functions via large buttons			0
based on their research , the foundation is suggesting a number of initiatives to tackle the problem			0
@entity3 's voice - activated @entity15 tool lets you send and listen to emails and texts from your phone the joyride app lets drivers play trivia games while driving and has a built - in media player the @entity222 app is built into some @entity224 handsets and is a @entity15 alternative it wants to ' limit the use of voice - activated technology to core driving - related activities such as climate control , windshield wipers and cruise control , and to make sure these applications do not lead to increased safety risk caused by mental distraction while the car is moving			1
' the @entity33 wants voice - to - text technologies such as using social media or listening to emails and text messages disabled			0
' this study constitutes the most in - depth analysis to date of mental distractions behind the wheel			0
@entity33 is hopeful that it will serve as a stepping stone toward working in collaboration with automakers to promote our shared goal of improving safety for all drivers , ' said @entity197			0
' specifically , these increasingly common voice - driven , in - vehicle technologies should be limited to use for just core driving tasks unless the activity results in no significant driver distraction			0

@entity3 's @entity2 system links a smart car 's display with an iphone
the files and apps of the @entity12 are then shown on the display of the car
@entity2 is controlled using @entity15 commands and is compatible with @entity290
recent research found hands - free devices to be as distracting as texting
researchers measured brainwaves as drivers listened to an *audiobook*
listening to the radio was classed as a minimal risk , but listening to emails being read aloud caused ' extensive risk ' to drivers and pedestrians
