by @entity1 reporter last updated at 10:54 am on 4th july 2011 price battle : @entity5 @entity4 commissioner @entity3 says that mobile networks are making profits of up to 400 per cent on calls abroad the slow destruction of the great @entity11 mobile phone ' roaming rip - off ' continues today with call charges set to be slashed again for consumers			1
from today it will be 3p per minute cheaper to make a call while abroad , and it will cost no more than 10 per minute to receive a call			2
the @entity4 has said it would like to see differences in the cost of phone use at home and abroad to disappear altogether by 2015			1
the changes bring the @entity4 a step closer to making sure that within three years it will be the same price to use a mobile either at home or abroad			1
commissioners have taken action because network operators are making profits of an astonishing 200 per cent on calls made in @entity11 and a staggering 400 per cent on calls received			1
from today the maximum permitted charge people will pay must be no more than 32p per minute , excluding @entity35 , for calls made while abroad - down from 35p			1
the rules mean it will also be no more than 10p per minute for calls received while abroad in @entity4 countries			1
the cost of sending a text message remains at a maximum of 10p while it costs nothing to receive one			2
but despite this , existing rules to prevent bill shocks for using the internet on a mobile while abroad remain weak			0
operators must only apply an automatic 50 euros or £ 45 cut - off limit on accounts unless the customer explicitly agrees otherwise , but need not do anything else			0
operators must warn customers when they reach 80 per cent of their limit			0
the @entity4 's digital agenda commissioner @entity3 admitted today that despite the cuts , a lack of open competition means operators are still making massive profits on foreign calls and internet use			2
savings : the cost in euros of making and receiving calls while abroad has fallen slowly since 2009 still expensive : consumers arriving in @entity11 by air , sea or rail will have the cost of using their phone abroad cut but mobile internet prices are still very high ' these latest price caps will temporarily reduce retail prices for making and receiving voice calls when in another @entity4 country during the coming year , ' he said			1
' but we have to tackle roaming problems at the root with a long - lasting structural approach			0
' @entity86 will therefore be coming forward very shortly with comprehensive new proposals for long - term solutions to address the underlying problem of lack of competition in roaming markets			0
' making calls : 3p cheaper receiving calls : capped at 10p per minute sending texts : 10p max receiving texts : free data roaming ( internet ) : £ 45 limit * * unless requested			2
compulsory maximum roaming rates were first imposed on mobile network operators four years ago to tackle what the @entity86 called the ' roaming rip - off '			0
a legal claim by the networks that the @entity86 was exceeding its powers failed last year , and rates fell further			0
action by @entity110 against high roaming charges has been one of the most popular consumer - driven moves by the @entity4			2
on average there has been a 60 per cent cut in the maximum charges operators could levy on mobile users making or receiving calls while in another @entity4 country since 2007			1
tomorrow 's additional price drop means mobile roaming charges are about 75 per cent cheaper on average than they were six years ago when the @entity86 first urged operators to cut their rates voluntarily			0
the current roaming rules apply until june 2012 and the @entity86 is due to present its plans for the following period next week .			0

charges drop to 32p per minute , down from 35p
calls received while in @entity11 to cost no more than 10p per minute
@entity4 wants same charges at home and abroad by 2015
