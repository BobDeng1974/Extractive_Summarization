@entity0 has a new listed building – a brick shed in a grandmother ’s back yard that was once used by ‘ mad hatters ’			1
the outhouse in a terrace street in @entity8 has been given @entity9 listed status by @entity11 , placing it on a par with other local treasures including @entity0 ’s @entity14 and @entity15			1
the shed , bought by pensioner @entity16 and her late husband , @entity17 , for a three - figure sum in the 1980s , is believed to be the only known surviving example of a largely intact , two - storey planking shop and bow garret – a workshop used by @entity8 ’s prosperous hatting industry in the 19th century			1
@entity0 's newest listed building is a brick shed in a grandmother 's back yard			1
it 's at 66a @entity28 and is believed to be the bow garret of @entity30 , a hatter who lived at nearby @entity33 on @entity34 , now @entity35 it has been listed by conservation experts after mp @entity38 and local historians uncovered its history			1
mrs @entity16 , 74 , a lollipop lady , said : ‘ i ’ve not been into history before but i am now			1
it ’s quite exciting to know that you ’ve got something like that in your back garden when you thought it was just an ordinary shed			1
‘ i knew nothing of it until @entity38 came knocking on my door last year with a historian and asked to have a look			2
i had to rush off but obviously i trusted him so i gave him the key to my house and told him to lock it when he left			2
when i returned three hours later from my shift , they were still there			2
pensioner @entity61 was surprised to discover that the shed where she stored her late husband 's tools and lawn mower was actually a rare example of a shop where hatters plied their trade store room : pensioner @entity16 uses the building as a place to keep her husband 's old tools ' i had no idea of the shed 's history			1
my late husband @entity17 and i only used the shed to put his tools in			1
he used to joke that he was going to convert it into a granny flat for me one day			2
we had already owned the house for around 30 years when we enquired about the shed in the 1980s			1
we bought it for a couple of hundred quid from a man who lived nearby			2
there was only a big table in there and it was very dusty and we had no idea of its significance			2
' the building at 66a @entity28 is believed to be the bow garret of @entity30 , a hatter who lived at nearby @entity33 on @entity34 , now @entity35			0
the bowing process , which involved the cleaning of the fur , would have taken place upstairs where the light was better			0
the planking process would have been carried out on the ground floor of the two - storey shed			1
it involved fur hoods being stripped from the animal and boiled in a kettle of water before being dried - but the process used an orange - coloured liquid that gave off toxic mercury fumes – triggering the term ‘ mad hatter ’			0
@entity114 added : ‘ the shed has had its fair share of wear and tear			2
two years ago a group of pigeons managed to get in and made a right mess doing their business all over the floor			0
‘ we had to smash one of the windows just to get them all out and we have boarded it up			0
‘ mr @entity38 told me that the alley just next to the shed is where the horse and carriage would park up and make it 's deliveries , it really is fantastic to be part of history , i never want to sell it now			1
’ historian @entity138 searched in dusty archives for the documentation showing that lollipop lady @entity16 was the owner of a building that was once at the centre of the hatting industry historian @entity138 said : ‘ i ’d seen the building and thought that ’s what it probably was so i looked for the earliest records i could find and saw a structure on the 1841 @entity152 map near to @entity33			1
‘ i looked at the census and saw that a journeyman hatter lived there with apprentices and his family , so that indicated it was a working place and allowed me to make the link with the outhouse at @entity28 which has all the features of a bow garret			0
’ ' it is the last surviving evidence of a major industry and is incredibly important for our nation ’s history ’ @entity170 , @entity11 at its peak , @entity8 and neighbouring @entity171 were the centre of @entity176 ’s hatting industry			1
by 1840 , thousands of felt hats were being produced each week			0
@entity8 became known for better quality hats made from beaver and rabbit fur , which would have been processed in mrs @entity16 ’s bow garret			1
@entity182 , of @entity11 , said : ‘ it is the last surviving evidence of a major industry and is incredibly important for our nation ’s history			1
’ mr @entity38 said : ‘ i ’m grateful to @entity11 for recognising just how important this small building is			1
’ in the days before modern machinery eliminated the need for felt hats to be made by hand , an occupational hazard was to be sent mad			0
the reason was that hatters were exposed to chronic mercury poisoning because of prolonged the @entity196 from @entity198 's @entity197 exposure to the mercury vapours caused by the method of felting work			2
to get felt for hats animals had to be separated from their pelts and the hatters used an orange - coloured solution containing mercuric nitrate as a smoothing agent to remove the skins and stick them together			0
the resulting felt was then shaped into large cones , shrunk in boiling water and @entity214 worked in confined areas and as the felt dried it gave off volatile vapours			0
prolonged exposure could cause mental confusion , emotional disturbances , and muscular weakness			0
@entity222 could also suffer nerve and kidney damage as well as red fingers , toes and cheeks and lose their hearing , hair , teeth and nails as well excessive sweating and bleeding from the ears and mouth			0
they also became shy and irritable			0
eventually , governments stepped in and in 1898 , legislation was passed in @entity236 to protect hatters from the risks of mercury exposure			0
by the turn of the 20th century , mercury poisoning among @entity176 hatters had become a rarity			1
on july 4 , 1862 the reverend @entity198 and the reverend @entity244 took a five - mile boat trip on the @entity246 in @entity247 with three young girls – @entity249 , 13 , @entity197 , 10 , and @entity250 , 8 – the daughters of @entity252 , the vice-chancellor of @entity253 and @entity254 of @entity255			0
on the trip the @entity256 mr @entity198 told them the story of a girl named @entity197 who was after an adventure			0
the girls loved it and @entity264 asked him to write the story down for her			0
the story became @entity197 and the @entity256 mr @entity198 published it under the nom de plume @entity198			0
as well as @entity197 , the book contained a panoply of marvellous characters including the @entity196 ( who held a tea party ) , the @entity273 , @entity274 , a @entity275 and a @entity276 .			2
