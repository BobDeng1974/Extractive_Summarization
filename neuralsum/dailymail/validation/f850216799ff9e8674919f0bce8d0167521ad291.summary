playing for @entity0 is a ' dream ' @entity2 is putting to the back of his mind , such is the striker 's determination to propel @entity8 forwards			1
there were not many clamouring for the 21 - year - old to be in the @entity8 starting line - up at the start of the season , never mind the national team			1
now , though , @entity2 is one of the most talked about players in the country as his @entity18 rise continues apace			1
@entity8 striker @entity2 has insisted he is fully focused on helping the club progress this season @entity2 rounds @entity21 goalkeeper @entity20 to score his second goal in a 2 - 1 win on sunday at @entity24 @entity2 has now scored 26 goals in 41 appearances for @entity8 in all competitions so far this season saturday 's brace in @entity8 ' 2 - 1 win at @entity21 increased his goal tally to 26 in all competitions - a remarkable haul which is likely to earn a first senior call - up this month			1
@entity34 could not fail but to be impressed by @entity2 's latest display , but front man is trying not to think about the potential of facing @entity38 or @entity39 this month			1
' i 've always said , i 've got to keep doing what i am doing , ' he said			0
' there are still a few more games until the international break and i want to do the best i can for @entity8			1
' that 's what i am looking to do			2
i want to get some more wins from until then and , yeah , we 'll see what happens			0
' obviously , i 've just got to keep doing what i am doing			0
' i think any @entity52 player playing would love to play for @entity0			2
it would be a dream but there are a lot of great players in @entity0			2
' i just have to keep concentrating and doing the best i can for @entity8			1
we 'll see what happens			0
' @entity2 is widely being tipped for a call up to the @entity0 team following his impressive form for @entity8 @entity2 lashes a shot at the @entity21 goal only for @entity21 defender @entity65 ( left ) to get in the way that determination to continue impressing at club level is certainly helping @entity8 get over a disappointing few weeks			1
the north @entity71 ' @entity70 exit was compounded by defeat to @entity73 in the @entity75 final , but they responded impressively with back - to - back victories over @entity77 and @entity21			1
' that is massive , ' @entity2 told @entity79			2
' that is what we said			0
' we had a disappointing couple of weeks , going out of the @entity70 and obviously losing the final , so we knew we had to get back on it , build a bit of momentum and get as far up in the league as we can			0
' we have managed to do that with two very important wins and hopefully we can continue it			0
' this latest victory moves @entity8 within three points of the top - four , while it leaves @entity21 deeper in the mire			1
the west @entity71 have now lost seven of their last eight top - flight matches , with relegation edging closer by the week			2
again , though , manager @entity98 defended his players ' application and , in particular , @entity101			0
the former @entity0 international was culpable for both goals , leading to chants from the away end of ' it 's time to retire ' - something a smattering of home fans joined in with			1
' i think @entity111 's applied himself well , ' @entity98 said			2
' i 'm very pleased with the way he played			0
' in the position we 're in , when goals go in people will always get blamed or people look at some more than others			0
' for @entity111 to be the age he is and applying himself the way he is in training and in games , we need to encourage him			0
' it 's always disappointing when a goal goes in , and you can always break it down and analyse it to its finest points			0
the players involved will always be disappointed			0
' @entity21 defender @entity101 clears the ball ahead of the oncoming @entity136 @entity21 winger @entity138 ( right ) leaps highest to win the ball in midfield on sunday @entity8 ' @entity140 ( left ) tussles for the ball with @entity21 's @entity143 during the @entity145 game			1

@entity2 scored twice in @entity8 's 2 - 1 win over @entity21
the striker has *bagged* 26 goals in 41 appearances for @entity8 this season
@entity2 is widely being tipped for a call - up to the @entity0 senior team
but the *22* - year - old says he is concentrating on his club for now
