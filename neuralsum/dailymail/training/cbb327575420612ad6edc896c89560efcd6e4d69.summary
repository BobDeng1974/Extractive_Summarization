by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor @entity3 secretary @entity2 conceded wednesday that it 's ' possible ' convicted felons could become @entity7 ' navigators , ' gaining access to tax information and @entity11 numbers of @entity1 as they help them register for insurance coverage			1
her admission came during a @entity15 hearing , in a tense exchange with @entity18 @entity17 senator @entity17			1
' is n't it true that there is no federal requirement for navigators to undergo a criminal background check , ' @entity17 asked her , ' even though they will receive personal – sensitive personal information from they individuals they help sign up for the @entity7 ? ' @entity3 secretary @entity2 conceded that criminals could be helping @entity1 fill out health insurance applications , gaining access to the tax information required to determine their eligibility for government subsidies round two : @entity2 faced an unexpectedly harsh grilling at the hands of @entity40			1
last week , she got a similarly hostile welcome in front of congressmen ' that is true , ' @entity2 responded in a moment of nervousness			2
' @entity47 could add an additional – um – background checks and other features , but it is not part of the federal requirement			2
' ' so a convicted felon could be a navigator , ' an annoyed @entity17 followed up , ' and could acquire sensitive personal information from an individual , unbeknownst to them ? ' ' uh , that is possible , ' she said , shifting blame to the groups responsible for deploying navigators in the field			2
' @entity2 also mentioned ' a self - attestation ' that navigators are expected to sign , confirming their identities and their intentions			2
' but it is possible			0
' president @entity67 is headed to @entity90 , @entity18 on wednesday , where he will promote the navigator program , a feature of @entity7 that allows paid assistants , many from community organizing groups cast in @entity67 's historical mold , to help @entity1 with their enrollment			1
despite the administration promoting the navigators as an alternative means of registration to the program 's semi-functional website , they too must use the website to determine whether or not applicants are eligible for federal government subsidies			0
march to the gallows : @entity2 faced unusually tough questions from a typically more sedate @entity15 panel , with one member calling for her resignation under questioning from @entity115 @entity114 sen. @entity114 , @entity2 tried to qualify her startling admission about information security under @entity7			1
' the navigators must go through a minimum of 20 hours of training , ' she said			0
' a significant portion focuses on privacy and security issues			0
' she insisted that applying for insurance under the new law ' there is no personal health information ever collected or needed , so they do n't have access to that			0
' but @entity114 countered that ' to estimate the subsidy somebody 's going to get under the @entity7 law , you 'd have to know their income on their tax return			0
' ' are the navigators going to be able to use that information in order to make that estimate ? ' ' if a consumer chooses – yes – to share that information , ' she replied , ' they can give the consumer the information about what they qualify for			0
' sen. @entity75 , a @entity152 from @entity2 ' home state of @entity76 , called for her resignation over the botched @entity7 website rollout .			1

@entity3 secretary says there 's no background - check requirement for the thousands of community activists tasked with being enrollment helpers
@entity18 senator grills her on whether felons could qualify , and she says yes
@entity2 insists the ' navigator ' *volunteers* get information security training
senator from her home state of @entity76 calls for her resignation
