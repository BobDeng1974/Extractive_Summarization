by @entity0 an @entity2 family which fought tirelessly for nine months to save their pet from death row says the ending is ' bittersweet ' after the dog was released from the pound - but forced to relocate more than 1200 kilometres from home			0
after a long and expensive battle with authorities , and a groundswell of public support via an incredible social media campaign , @entity17 , an @entity18 whose breed is considered dangerous in @entity19 , was finally freed on wednesday			1
and despite a huge and emotional sigh of relief from his owner @entity22 , @entity17 is unable to spend the rest of his life with the family that loves him , a strict condition of his release			1
lucky to be alive : @entity17 the dog was sentenced to death for being a restricted breed in @entity19 , @entity2 , but thanks to a campaign to save him he will instead be relocated to the @entity34 , some 1200km away from home ms @entity22 said her dog was captured by the @entity37 after he was found by rangers ' wandering at large ' when he escaped their backyard last year			1
the family expected to have @entity17 returned and to pay a fine			2
instead , the council instead issued a destruction order for @entity17 - declaring he was part @entity18 , a restricted breed in the state of @entity19			1
his family had adopted him just seven months prior to his capture , but believed him to be a labrador / staffordshire terrier cross			2
after a long search for a vet willing to independently assess @entity17 ’ breed , he was named as ' a crossbred entire male dog ' who ' appears to have the physical characteristics more of an @entity56 than any other breed '			1
the veterinarian ’s certificate should have secured the dog ’s immediate release but the council stood by their classification of @entity17 as a @entity64 , which was later supported by a @entity66 - engaged assessor			2
the matter was then taken to court in january thanks to the @entity69 , who found a legal team willing to fight pro bono , but later adjourned to enable the parties to explore the option of re-homing @entity17 outside the @entity37 ’s jurisdiction			1
stressed out : @entity17 was forced to live in @entity37 's pound for nine months while his owners fought a destruction order in the courts in addition to fighting the death penalty , the family also was required to pay an impoundment bill of nearly $ 30 per day , which now totals more than $ 4500			1
but thanks to fundraising efforts from @entity19 and @entity89 - based advocacy group @entity88 , those costs were covered in full			2
@entity88 's founding member @entity90 said she launched a social media campaign called ' @entity92 ' after hearing of the family 's fight and the financial dilemma that might have prevented them getting @entity17 back			1
within hours of launching the campaign last friday , ms @entity90 said donations to help the family had totalled more than $ 2000 - well more than the $ 1500 required			0
ms @entity90 said determining a dog 's breed could be problematic , if not impossible			0
' we do n't know for sure if @entity17 is a @entity64 or not , it 's impossible to tell the breed of a dog or find out if he has any @entity64 in him			1
' that 's the biggest flaw with breed - specific legislation			0
' as a puppy , @entity17 was a playful and energetic dog and his owners hope he will be just as happy in his new home the council had told @entity17 's owners they would release the pet if they satisfied a range of requirements , which ms @entity90 said they did , and paid the impoundment costs			2
however , ms @entity90 said officers inexplicably changed their minds that same afternoon , deciding to keep @entity17 until the next scheduled court hearing in april			2
but after the fees and documentation was provided , the council finally chose to release @entity17 on wednesday - on the condition he be sent to the @entity34 , more than 1200km away from his home			1
ms @entity90 said relocating @entity17 to the @entity34 was their only viable option , with the territory the only place in @entity2 where the breed was not deemed illegal			1
' it 's a bittersweet ending , i guess , ' ms @entity90 said			0
' the family is really happy because they thought @entity17 was going to be put to sleep , and now he has a really loving home to go to			2
' despite being on death row , @entity17 was treated to a lot of cuddles and attention while in the pound ms @entity22 said saying goodbye was the hardest thing she 's ever had to do			1
' it 's hard to see the silver lining the day after saying my goodbyes with a night full of tears and mixed emotions , but yesterday was a beautiful sight ... he was so happy and so curious with all his forgotten surroundings , ' she said			0
' we all just need to try and keep our minds set on the good things that have come of this instead of his month after month long fear of his end			0
' her partner @entity156 and four - year - old daughter were also reeling over @entity17 ' relocation , devastated he would n't be coming back home			0
' my daughter knows that he is safe and will be going from his holiday to a new mummy where he will be safe and loved and have a lot of fun , though you can imagine her pain loosing her friend , ' she said			0
' my partner loved @entity17 , and the fact of loosing him from the beginning has seemed unbearable for him to think about			0
' but despite the pain , ms @entity22 said it was a happy ending for an animal she thought would be euthanised for doing nothing wrong			0
' luckily with all the support and followers we have we all have achieved something amazing , ' she said			0
' he is safe , he is free and he will be loved			0
