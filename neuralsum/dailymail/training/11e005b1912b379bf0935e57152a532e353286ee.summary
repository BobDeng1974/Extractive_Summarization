by @entity0 @entity2 @entity1 have unveiled a statue in @entity4 of their compatriot who triggered the @entity6 by assassinating the @entity8 crown prince there 100 years ago today			1
members of the @entity11 community in the mostly @entity13 city held a ceremony in their quarter to celebrate ' hero ' @entity18 ’s shooting of archduke @entity19			1
a young actor dressed as the assassin , who had hoped to free @entity2 from @entity23 control and join the @entity24 , ran on to the stage and fired two shots in the air			1
@entity53 , the president of @entity55 half of @entity2 , then unveiled the two - metre - high bronze statue yesterday			1
' @entity35 was a freedom fighter and the @entity8 was an occupier here , ' he said			1
' people who live here have never been on the same side of history and are still divided			2
' we are sending different messages and that says it all about this country which is being held together by international violence			2
' @entity2 people gathered to touch or kiss the statue of @entity35 , who they consider a freedom fighter the blood - soaked undershirt @entity19 was wearing on the day he was assassinated is also on display at the @entity42 in @entity43 archduke @entity19 's blood - soaked uniform is one of the star attractions at the @entity42 in @entity43 in the @entity4 they have a different view of @entity2 's future : to divide the country so that the @entity83 part can join neighbouring @entity83			1
underlining this division , at the other end of @entity87 , which is controlled by the @entity13 and @entity89 federation , the @entity84 will play an @entity48 - sponsored performance			2
it is planned as both salute to @entity94 integration and a symbolic start of a new century of peace where the emperor ’s heir was killed on june 28 , 1914			2
the assassination , which symbolically took place on the @entity102 ’s @entity101 , led the @entity8 to declare war on neighbouring @entity83			1
and , thanks to a series of alliances , @entity94 ’s major powers were all dragged into fighting an unimaginably bloody conflict that led to the slaughter of 16million people			0
yet what was really behind the war were the dark aspirations of @entity113 – which despite its greater military and industrial might – was an imperial minnow			0
ceremony : members of @entity120 @entity119 , left , president of @entity122 @entity53 , center , and local mayor @entity124 , right , uncover the statue of @entity35 @entity35 , who is considered a hero among @entity1 in @entity2 @entity113 , which erroneously believed @entity127 would remain neutral if it invaded @entity128 , essentially wanted to shift the balance of power in its favour			1
its military chiefs planned for a swift and crushing blow against @entity128 in which its army would reach @entity134 before the @entity128 or @entity127 had fully mobilized their troops			0
but the conflict - characterised by the stalemate of trench war and of lions led by donkeys as they were machine - gunned down for a few inches of land – would last until 1918			0
the war , which pitted also pitted @entity144 , @entity145 and ultimately the @entity146 against @entity113 , @entity8 and @entity147 , changed the face of the continent			1
ultimately , the @entity127 and @entity128 were victorious , but the @entity113 army was never defeated militarily			0
rather , their countrymen were being starved to death at home and the entrance of the @entity146 in 1917 made the @entity156 look unbeatable			0
this sense of a cheated military outcome – combined with harsh reparations ordered by @entity128 – is argued by many historians to have been a cause of @entity162			0
mounting @entity144 casualties during @entity6 also led to a @entity165 dictatorship that led to the deaths of millions in purges and careless tactics in the following war			0
yet all these tragic events might have been avoided if @entity19 ’s chauffeur had n’t driven the wrong way back on june 28 , 1914			0
@entity173 made a wrong turn past @entity4 ’s @entity176 ’s deli , where forlorn gunman @entity35 was dining after his earlier assassination plan failed			0
the @entity83 leapt out of the café and seized his chance – and wwo bullets later , both @entity19 and princess @entity181 , who was shot as she tried to cover her husband , lay dead			1
@entity19 was sitting in the back of this car with his wife @entity181 when they were shot dead by assassins in @entity4 one hundred years ago the car 's bodywork was pierced by incoming rounds as the @entity191 and his wife lay mortally wounded where the tide of history turned : tourists gathered on friday around a replica of the @entity198 car that archduke @entity19 and his wife @entity199 were riding in when they were assasinated by @entity35 - and at the spot where it happened , in front of the museum in downtown @entity4 the crucial chain of events : how @entity6 began			2

@entity18 is considered a hero among @entity1 in @entity2
he triggered *wwi* by shooting dead the @entity8 crown prince
@entity1 considered the @entity8 to be *unwanted* occupiers
