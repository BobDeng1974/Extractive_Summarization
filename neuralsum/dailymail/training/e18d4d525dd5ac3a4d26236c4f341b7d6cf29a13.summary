by @entity0 published : 07:52 est , 19 december 2012 updated : 10:01 est , 19 december 2012 parents who lose children in tragic accidents may be able to clone replacements within the next 50 years , a @entity2 - winning scientist has claimed sir @entity11 , the @entity12 scientist whose work cloning frogs in the 1950s and 60s led to the creation of @entity14 the sheep by @entity17 scientists in 1996 , said human cloning could happen within half a century			1
the biologist who won this year ’s nobel prize thinks that while any attempt to clone a human would raise complex ethical issues , people would soon overcome their concerns if the technique became medically useful			0
dolly the sheep was the first of several mammals to be cloned , including cc the kitten he explained that in - vitro fertilisation was regarded with considerable suspicion when it was first developed but became widely accepted after the birth of @entity34 , the first ‘ test tube baby ’ , in 1978			1
however , the vast majority of animal embryos cloned today are deformed so major improvements in cloning methods would have to be made , he added			1
speaking on @entity42 ’s @entity41 , the biologist said he had predicted at the time of his frog experiments that the successful cloning of a mammal would happen within 50 years , and that and that the same answer could be applied to human cloning today			2
he said : ‘ when my first frog experiments were done an eminent @entity50 reporter came down and said “ how long will it be before these things can be done in mammals or humans ? ” ‘ i said : “ well , it could be anywhere between 10 years and 100 years – how about 50 years ? ” it turned out that was n’t far off the mark as far as @entity14 was concerned			1
maybe the same answer is appropriate			0
’ sir @entity11 , who won the @entity61 in october , says human cloning could happen within 50 years the 79 - year - old former @entity63 added that cloning a human effectively means making an identical twin , and doctors would therefore simply be ‘ copying what nature has already produced ’			1
‘ i take the view that anything you can do to relieve suffering or improve human health will usually be widely accepted by the public – that is to say if cloning actually turned out to be solving some problems and was useful to people , i think it would be accepted , ’ he said			2
during his public lectures - which include speeches at @entity78 and @entity79 - he often asks his audience if they would be in favour of allowing parents of deceased children , who are no longer fertile , to create another using the mother ’s eggs and skin cells from the first child , assuming the technique was safe and effective			1
‘ the average vote on that is 60 per cent in favour , ’ he said			0
‘ the reasons for “ no ” are usually that the new child would feel they were some sort of a replacement for something and not valid in their own right			2
‘ but if the mother and father , if relevant , want to follow that route , why should you or i stop them ? ’ almost 35 years ago , ethical questions were raised over test - tube babies , but since the birth of @entity34 in 1978 the process of in vitro fertilisation has become commonplace , and is used by thousands of infertile couples around the world			0
initial fears about test tube babies faded after the birth of @entity34 in 1978			0
seen here with her mother , @entity116 ( left ) and as the @entity118 ( right ) announced the birth			0

*heartache* of losing a child could be eased , says @entity2 - winner
cloning of @entity14 was followed by a succession of other mammals
