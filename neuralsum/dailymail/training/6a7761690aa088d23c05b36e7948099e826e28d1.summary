by @entity0 published : 11:15 est , 24 october 2013 updated : 10:26 est , 27 october 2013 charging an electric car could be as simple as finding a place to park it , as early as next year			1
a pilot scheme being rolled out in @entity5 will see a handful of wireless charging stations , that look like manhole covers , for electric vehicles			1
the start - up , based in the city , aims to make charging electric vehicles faster and easier with its wireless technology and app for drivers			1
a pilot scheme being rolled out in @entity5 will see a handful of manhole covers transformed into wireless charging stations for electric vehicles @entity22 's manhole points use electromagnetic resonance to transfer electricity to the car 's charging coil			1
this negates the need for wires			0
@entity22 's technology claims to charge vehicles at greater distances than other wireless charging stations			2
they currently still take between eight and 12 hours to fully charge a vehicle			0
@entity36 has collaborated with @entity37 to bring the project to an area near @entity40 early next year			0
the company 's website says : ' the durable , embedded hardware unit will be deployed as a sustainable infrastructure device in city streets , parking lots and garages , motor pools , highways and other highly trafficked areas			0
' while electric vehicles charging points are gradually being rolled out in some @entity54 ( as well as in the @entity55 , ) it can take hours to charge a vehicle , which is not always practical			2
@entity22 's manhole points , which are coming to @entity5 early next year , use electromagnetic resonance to transfer electricity to the car 's charging coil - negating the need for wires @entity22 's manhole points use electromagnetic resonance to transfer electricity to the car 's charging coil - negating the need for wires - at greater distances than other wireless charging stations , although while they are faster , they currently still take between eight and 12 hours to fully charge a vehicle			1
while they might be suitable for long - stay car parks or driveways , the firm envisions that in the future the intelligent manhole covers could be placed in rows along a traffic lane to top up cars ' power while they are in motion			0
@entity22 's founder , @entity80 , told @entity81 there could be ' a small strip at every yard or so that has another wireless charging plate , so as you go down the street you 're collecting a charge '			2
the start - up 's website says : ' it is the aim of @entity22 today is to accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles through the deployment of our wireless charging network			1
' by offering a wireless charging option for electric vehicles , @entity22 will provide a safe , fast and cost affordable method of charging electric vehicles that eliminates the hazards and inconveniences associated with plug - in charging.â € ‹ ' a @entity22 app lets users find vacant parking spots in which to charge their cars as well as tell them the perfect position to park over the intelligent manholes ( centre ) so their car recharges in the most efficient way possible			1
it also tells them how much power their vehicle has the company said its ' green parking ' and ' green loading zones ' will give commuters access to reliable , premium parking locations and cost - competitive power , while the range of commercial fleets will be extended and reduce traffic congestion			0
there is also a @entity22 app that lets users find vacant parking spots in which to charge their cars as well as tell them the perfect position to park over the intelligent manholes so their car recharges in the most efficient way possible			0
a ' pay it ! ' feature allows users of the charging point to pay their electricity bill , while a power meter shows the vehicle 's charging progress so users can check on their car 's power remotely			2
' @entity142 provides the peace - of - mind and reliability of opportunistic charging to electric vehicle owners who are discouraged by range anxiety , limited public charging locations and higher associated vehicle costs , ' the company said			0
the young company is talking to @entity154 about the potential to create a system to charge its fleets of electric delivery lorries , placing charging points at loading zones to charge lorries when they are stocking up on supplies and making sure they do not have to deviate from their delivery routes , @entity152 reported			0

@entity54 start - up @entity22 's manhole points use electromagnetic resonance to transfer electricity to the an electric car 's charging coil
pilot scheme is rolling out by @entity5 's @entity40 next year
the company has also *developed* an app to help drivers find the charging points as well as how to park *precisely* over them
