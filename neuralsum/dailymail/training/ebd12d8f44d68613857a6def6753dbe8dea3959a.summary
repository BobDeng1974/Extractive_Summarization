by @entity0 published : 14:21 est , 17 june 2013 updated : 02:49 est , 18 june 2013 they have transformed their dull street into a glorious green garden and been lauded by the council several times			1
but the community - spirited residents of @entity7 in @entity8 have now been told by the same authority they must ditch the whole thing - because it is a ' health and safety hazard '			1
their efforts transforming the dull suburban alleyway have helped cut anti-social behaviour in the area , revitalised the street and got neighbours working together			1
uplifting : one resident said that the pathway had even helped the area overcome its anti-social behaviour problems defiant : @entity21 , who led the transformation , says he is ' absolutely livid ' street in bloom : @entity21 with his flowerpots , which are now deemed a health and safety risk haven : locals from all around @entity8 come to enjoy the flowers on @entity7 since residents began transforming the path six years ago , they have been awarded a number of community prizes by @entity34 council			1
in the prestigious @entity34 in @entity35 in 2010 they were honoured for ‘ best street effort ’ and just last year they won ‘ best community effort ’			1
in a sudden reversal , however , the council which awarded those prizes has now insisted the plant pots are dangerous and may obstruct people walking down the alley			2
those who have worked for years to maintain the beautiful ‘ secret garden ’ say it is ridiculous that it is being targeted by ‘ jobsworth ’ council chiefs			1
‘ this area has become a wildlife corridor and attracts butterflies , hedgehogs , bees and bats			0
children from the nearby nursery come here for nature walks , ’ said @entity50 , 55 , who led the transformation			0
‘ now the same council that gave us the awards wants us to remove the planters			0
’ haven : residents say the uplifting pathway has improved the whole area hard work : the residents of @entity7 have made a huge effort to make the street look well - cared for and attractive , spending thousands on their gardening well - maintained : thousands of pounds have been spent on maintaining the flowers , which will be removed unless residents change the containers they say if residents want to save the displays they must ‘ apply for grant funding ’ to find more suitable plant pots which comply with highways legislation			1
mr @entity82 , who has spent about £ 8,000 on the street displays , said locals are deeply upset and angry			0
‘ this community has put in a lot of effort to make the street look nice , ’ he added			2
‘ i have been putting out various planters and have spent a lot of money doing it			0
other residents have added to that and also look after their gardens well			2
all this has helped us to win awards			0
’ retired home carer @entity98 , said : ‘ this pathway has given so much pleasure to so many people			0
it has improved the area , which used to suffer from anti-social behaviour some years ago			1
it ’s like a little haven			0
’ fun for children : @entity109 , manager of @entity110 , centre , going for a walk with @entity113 , left , and @entity114 , right in jeopardy : residents have been told to apply for a grant for new plant pots if they want to hang on to their flowers obstruction : gardening organiser @entity21 pointed out that even if they do get new plant pots that will not over come the supposed access problems mother - of - two @entity125 , 32 , of nearby @entity127 , @entity8 , added : ‘ i bring my two children here all the time and they love it			1
we call it the secret garden			2
i think every street should be like this , ’ while local nursery manager @entity109 , 29 , said : ‘ we bring the children here and they love it			2
‘ they point out all the little features and flowers			0
it ’s a safe place to walk down here			0
’ despite the upset in the community , @entity143 maintained residents will have to apply for grant funding for new planters which meet ‘ required standards ’ and do not obstruct those with ‘ accessibility needs ’			1
a spokesman added : ‘ @entity143 appreciates the efforts of residents of @entity7 over the years			1
however , the number of planters has increased to an extent where they obstruct the pavement			0
‘ not all residents agree to the scale of this community effort and have concerns about impact on the pathways			2
‘ under highways legislation we have an obligation to protect the rights of the public at large			0

gardening *scheme* has brought local community together and cut anti-social behaviour
residents began transforming the path six years ago - and @entity143 honoured them for their work
but authority *backtrack* and insist the glorious garden is now a hazard
organiser @entity21 says he is ' absolutely livid ' after they are told to get a grant for safety - *compliant* flower pots
