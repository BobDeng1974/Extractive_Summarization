for most of the year it is a quaint seaside town , but the picturesque port of @entity2 in @entity3 took on an altogether more sinister air this weekend as thousands of @entity5 , steampunks , and fans of the macabre descended for a twice - yearly celebration of gothic culture , and all things that go bump in the night			2
fans travelled from across the globe to attend the famous @entity14 , donning their spookiest finery for the five - day extravaganza promising music , dance and shopping			0
the festival , which has been running since 1994 , is the largest of its kind in the world and is so popular that in 1997 is began running twice a year , in april and october - to coincide with @entity24			0
the town in @entity3 was chosen because it was where @entity27 author @entity26 wrote the gothic horror classic @entity30 , and it is filled with eerie landmarks such as @entity32 , which is said to be the inspiration behind the literary vampire 's castle			1

@entity267 has been running since 1994 and is the largest of its kind in the world
