footage from the september 29 incident shows @entity10 , who was off duty at the time , getting closer and closer to @entity10 's car hiding : @entity10 leaves court in @entity36 today with his face hidden after a short hearing into his role in the biker gang assault occupy jail : @entity10 , 32 , was held in custody for his alleged role in the biker gang beating			1
he has served with @entity68 for ten years and was allegedly undercover with @entity69 for five of those @entity71 , who told cops he was trying to stop the attack , was also included in the indictment			1
he ' was the voice of reason and was the most reasonable , courageous person there , to stand up to these people who he 's not friends with			0
he does n't know these bikers ' , his lawyer said			0
@entity10 was chased up the @entity83 and was pulled out of his car on w. 178th st. as his wife watched in horror with their young child in the back seat			1
a @entity24 video of the attack shows a rider fitting @entity10 's description in the main group chasing @entity10 's @entity15			1
at no point does he try to stop the pursuit			0
at around two minutes he surges from the back and positions himself to the left of the vehicle			0
his red bike - which looks like the one in @entity10 's online postings - is later seen right behind the suv boxing it in			1
when @entity10 stops for the first time the man has moved to its driver 's side and as one biker tries to open the driver 's door , he goes to get off his bike to assist , but @entity10 speeds off			2
then he is seen again at the end when @entity10 is set upon during the second , final confrontation			0
biker punk : @entity10 created a very alternative online persona and he cut his hair in a mohawk to look just like those he was mixing with the video shows the man believed to be @entity10 apparently pulling up alongside the right of the @entity15			2
his lawyers in court on october 9 claimed that he never went within 12ft of the vehicle but he is much closer than that as his bike comes to a halt by the rear window			0
@entity10 's defence also claimed in court that the window was already broken - but in the video it is still intact when he reaches it			1

the description from court appears to match him up in the @entity24 video			0
the police are said to have another video which shows him actually hitting the windscreen			0
@entity10 's lawyer @entity174 said that videos of the incident will exonerate his client who he said was being targeted because he was a detective			1
but despite the seriousness of the claims against him , a judge agreed with @entity10 's lawyer that pictures of him in court should not be allowed			2
mr @entity174 said that he was involved with the @entity68 intelligence division which deals with ' infiltrating various organizations ' and ' to disclose his identity would jeopardize his life , his families '			0

he attended demonstrations and lived like the protestors			0
@entity205 rousing : @entity10 tweeted occupy events including this ' spring training ' event in april , 2012 rogue ? it is unclear how much of @entity10 's online personalities were part of his cover or his genuine lifestyle full throttle : @entity10 showed off his bright red @entity167 on his social media accounts - the complaint against him says he was riding one at the time of the incident hurt : @entity10 needed stitches after he was attacked by bikers in @entity36 as he tried to protect his wife and child			1
