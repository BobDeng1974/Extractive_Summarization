by @entity0 former @entity2 defender @entity1 said wednesday 's draw with @entity4 showed why @entity5 needed @entity6 at the @entity7			1
the @entity9 defender is likely to be in @entity10 as a pundit for @entity12 after retiring from international football in 2012 in the aftermath of the @entity16 race row			1
experience : @entity18 says @entity2 could do with @entity6 in @entity10 @entity5 resisted calls for him to try and entice @entity6 back into the @entity2 fold and that decision could backfire with a shortage of defensive options			1
' @entity6 does n't look like a bad option now , ’ @entity24 told @entity26 after @entity2 's 2 - 2 draw			1
' @entity5 is likely to say ' it was an experimental side , he was pleased with a few things and unhappy with a few things and we move on to the next game '			1
' struggle : @entity2 defender @entity34 was at fault for @entity4 's first goal @entity37 and @entity34 struggled in the heart of defence , while using @entity40 at right back was exposed by @entity4 ’s left winger @entity41			1
@entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45 , before he went off injured , all took the chance to press their claims for a starting place			2
@entity24 added : ' one or two players did okay			2
we have shown when @entity2 give the ball away , it is not good enough , we are not organised enough			2
you have to be ready to defend			2
i am not sure enough of the @entity2 players are aware of that			0
impressive : @entity44 took the chance to stake his claim for a starting role at @entity7 finals ' @entity4 have aspirations of getting out of their @entity7 group with @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65			1
there is no real favourite to get out of that group but they have shown they are a decent side here			0
' @entity24 said @entity2 's @entity72 was unfortunate to be sent off following a late clash with @entity74			0
he said : it was a rash challenge by @entity72			0
he dived in , did n't get the ball			0
the ref could possibly have booked him			0
then @entity78 pushes him in the head , went to grab his throat but changed his mind			0
a red card for both is unnecessary			0
a yellow would have done both of them			0
' concern : former @entity88 and @entity2 defender @entity1 focused : @entity1 challenges @entity10 's @entity89 during 2002 @entity7 quarter - final			1

@entity5 was short of options for *friendly* against @entity4
@entity5 resisted calls to try and lure @entity6 out of international retirement
