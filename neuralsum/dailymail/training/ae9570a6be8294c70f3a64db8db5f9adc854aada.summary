by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity2 was hit by a second bout of freak sandstorms today , causing an estimated £ 50,000 damage to crops			1
farmers in @entity8 , @entity9 , had just spent a week clearing up after freak winds created 4ft high sand drifts on tuesday when more gales swept in , whipping up further sandstorms and devastating crops			1
barley farmer @entity15 said : ' there 's parts around my farm where the only thing showing above the sand is the top bit of the fence			1
' @entity44 in eastern @entity2 mobilised snowploughs to clear the roads , but today ’s winds were threatening to undo much of the work			1
@entity15 explained : ' the effect has been felt far and wide again now			1
i 'm hearing stories from all over the place that people are having exactly the same problems from @entity54 to @entity55			0
' @entity56 , the @entity57 branch secretary for @entity58 , @entity54 and @entity9 , said : ' it 's going to take some farmers several days to clear the sand away			1
' we might have lost 10 per cent of the harvest , and then again we might have lost 50 per cent			2
it 's too early to say at the moment			2
' the situation will only become apparent over the coming weeks when crops either grow or do n't			2
' bizarre sight : sand dunes , some up to 4ft high , in @entity15 's fields @entity71 fields : how the fields in @entity9 should look			1
mr @entity15 estimates that the sandstorms could cost farmers tens of thousands of pounds in lost crops temperatures are expected to soar to a glorious @entity77 ( @entity78 ) , with southern areas enjoying one of the warmest days of the year so far			1
if the mercury rises as high as predicted , it will be as hot as the city of @entity84 in @entity85 – and warmer than @entity86 , where it is expected to reach just @entity88 ( 66f )			2
but the country will have a north - south split			2
while southerners enjoy relatively balmy conditions , those in northern @entity92 and @entity2 will see temperatures dipping to zero at night			1
and the chillier weather is expected to spread south by the weekend , bringing clouds and rain to most places			1
forecaster @entity100 said : ‘ as we move into the middle of this week we could see one of the warmest days of the year so far , but only in a few places			0
‘ we will have a weather system that essentially cuts the @entity106 in half			2
temperatures in the upper half – northern @entity92 and @entity2 – will be around 9 - @entity110 ( 48 - 52f ) , which is n’t too far off normal for the time of year			1
‘ but in the southern half of the @entity106 we are likely to see fairly dry , fine weather , sunshine and temperatures that could reach @entity116 ( 70f )			1
’ low visibility : sandstorms swept across @entity9 covering roads and fields dangerous : driving conditions on the @entity122 near @entity8 in @entity9 were poor yesterday as gales sent clouds of sand racing across the land hazy : the sandstorms came less than a week after a first storm was cleared up by the council however , he warned the good weather would not last , adding : ‘ by the time we get to friday that band will have pushed its way to the south of the country			1
most of the country can expect a cool and showery end to the week			0
‘ we can expect highs of @entity110 ( 52f ) , which is average for april			0
and on saturday and sunday we ’ll have a band of rain from the north - west arriving in the south - east			2
' the warmest day of the year so far was april 14 , when @entity77 ( 72f ) was recorded in @entity142			1
but these glimpses of good weather are little comfort to businesses struggling to deal with one of the coldest springs in decades			2
in @entity151 , organisers of the @entity150 are being forced to import hundreds of thousands of tulips from @entity153 because of a shortage of @entity156 blooms caused by cold weather			2
manager @entity158 said there was ‘ very little likelihood ’ of getting enough homegrown flowers before the event on may 4			0
hayfever sufferers will feel the effects of the highest pollen levels for half a century , but the rest of us should enjoy a balmy few days - in which southern @entity92 will enjoy warmer weather than @entity170 ( where it 's currently around @entity88 ) before it starts to feel unseasonably cold again			1
hay fever expert professor @entity172 said the cold march and start to april means the period until june will see its highest pollen levels since 1962			1
peak pollen levels normally occur later in summer , but the bitter march delayed the start of the pollen season by a month , with tree pollen now soaring and the expected ' phenomenon of tree pollen colliding with grass pollen ' from mid-may			1
blossoming : gun salutes in honour of the @entity184 were postponed until today as her actual birthday , which is on april 21st , fell on a sunday flowers of spring : the @entity188 arriving in @entity189 for the 41 gun salute in honour of the @entity193 's 87th birthday meanwhile the extended wintry conditions mean that spring is blooming late , quite literally			1
last year @entity106 ’s gardens , parks and woodlands were awash with a stunning riot of colour , but this spring has yet to bloom after a bitter march followed hard on the heels of a cold winter			0
with spring delayed by over a month and no real signs of seasonal flowers such as tulips or bluebells , many will be wondering if @entity106 will ever burst into bloom			0
but garden writer @entity208 , a former @entity209 vice-chairman , says that with the arrival of warmer weather , we are likely to have a much shorter but more intense spring awakening			1
forecasters are predicting temperatures will remain higher than the seasonal average for the rest of the week – a boon for gardeners			0
mr @entity220 said : ‘ plants , particularly spring varieties , have a self - survival kit			0
' they wo n’t grow until the temperature is above @entity226 ( @entity227 ) degrees for a period of time			0
once warm weather sticks around they ’ll kick into rapid growth			0
' because of the bitterly cold march , we are running about a month late compared to a normal season : instead of it being a drawn - out spring , we are going to have an explosion of colour , but over a shorter @entity238 will soon be treated to a fantastically colourful bounty			0
’ after a pleasant , sunny weekend for much of the country , the @entity240 says temperatures will remain slightly warmer than the seasonal average this week – reaching @entity245 ( @entity244 ) by thursday in the south east			2
in bloom : a sea of daffodils set the scene for the @entity193 's birthday celebrations ' mixed bag ' : @entity240 forecasters are predicting a week of changeable weather but it is still too soon to pack away your winter woollens			1
at the weekend temperatures are due to plummet to a chilly @entity258 ( @entity259 )			0
may is almost upon us , but there were still patches of frost in parts of the @entity106 overnight between saturday and sunday , with a low of -2.7c in @entity267 , @entity268			0
while there will be some sunny spells across the @entity106 in the coming week , @entity106 are advised to keep their umbrellas and jackets close to hand along with their sunglasses			0
mr @entity274 described bands of rain moving in from the @entity277 , bringing wind and showers to the @entity106			0
' this week on the whole is on the unsettled side and quite changeable			0
' we 've got bands of rain moving in from the @entity277 , although it wo n't be a wash out			0
' ' a fair bit of cloud ' is also expected throughout the week , he said , with conditions likely to change from sunny to grey even ' within each day '			0
' temperatures in the south might manage @entity245 in the @entity290 later in the week , perhaps by thursday , ' said the forecaster , who added that current temperatures were fairly typical for the time of year			2
' so it will be warm at times in the south			0
broadly speaking we 've got a north - south split , with the north wetter and windier , but still with some sunshine			0
in the south it will be less wet and windy			0
' while temperatures dropped to @entity303 in @entity268 overnight , @entity301 in @entity2 recorded a low of @entity305 , in a ' flip ' of the typical pattern of warmer conditions in the south .			1

@entity2 *battered* again by second round of sandstorms devastating crops
farmer @entity15 in @entity9 says the sand is so high ' the only thing showing is top of fences '
@entity319 's @entity189 was full of daffodils to set the scene for the @entity184 salute
despite a mixed bag of weather , temperatures in the south may top @entity77 on *wednesday* : hotter than @entity328
hayfever sufferers braced for worst pollen levels for more than 50 years this spring
