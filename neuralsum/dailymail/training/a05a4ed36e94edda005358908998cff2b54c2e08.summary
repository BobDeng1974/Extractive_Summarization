they might have been waiting for @entity1 , the well - respected president of @entity3 , but @entity5 's @entity4 and @entity7 @entity6 only had eyes for each other			1
as they stood on the red carpet outside the @entity12 awaiting ms @entity1 , the couple , who married in 2004 , exchanged loving glances - and continued to do so long after the @entity15 premier had made her entrance			2
later , the pair stood side by side as they took a salute from the guard of honour laid on for ms @entity1 who was making her first visit to @entity5 since being elected president in march			1
in june , ms @entity1 , a socialist , was left beaming after prince @entity43 made a state visit to the country and met with her at the @entity46 in @entity47			1
this time around , the president , who seems to be at risk of becoming a monarchist , was left smiling after a chat with @entity4 , 46 , during which @entity6 , 42 , looked on			2
@entity6 herself is fresh from a successful trip to @entity55 where she made a speech at the @entity57 in @entity58			0
looking good : queen @entity6 was every inch the royal style icon in her grey suit and pearl earrings big moment : the royal couple look on as they take a salute from the guard of honour laid on for ms @entity1 pomp : the welcome ceremony at the @entity12 saw ranks of soldiers dressed in their best file past big arrival : ms @entity1 was making her first visit to @entity5 since being elected earlier this year first visit : prince @entity43 , pictured here in @entity47 , was the first royal to shake the hand of the @entity3 president delighted : ms @entity1 appeared almost as delighted to meet @entity4 as she was to meet prince @entity43 all smiles : president @entity1 waves to photographers as she 's escorted into the @entity12 by @entity7 @entity6 the speech , which was made partly in @entity83 and in @entity84 , was to art fans during the launch of an exhibition dedicated to the @entity5 artist , @entity88			1
@entity88 , who was born in 1599 , is best known for his 1656 work , @entity90 , which is usually housed in @entity92 's @entity91			0
the painting , which shows @entity94 surrounded by her maids of honour and servants , was commissioned by @entity98 - an ancestor of the current @entity4			0
@entity90 also has an @entity55 connection as @entity94 went on to become the @entity100 and wife of @entity102 who oversaw the running of his lands from the @entity105 in @entity58			0
it was also at the @entity105 that @entity94 died in 1673 aged just 21 , although not before she gave her husband four children , all of whom - @entity109 , @entity110 notwithstanding - died in childhood			0
on their way : president @entity1 appeared to be enjoying her visit to @entity5 - her first since taking office dramatic : the smartly uniformed honour guard formed a dramatic backdrop for the welcome ceremony esteem : unusually , the ceremony was held at the grand @entity12 instead of the @entity122 all smiles : after bowing his head for the @entity125 , @entity4 beamed broadly at the soldiers on parade despite the tragic story behind @entity90 , it remains one of @entity88 ' most famous paintings , if not the only one he did of @entity94			1
@entity6 , although not famous for her love of art , has made supporting her native culture a key part of her role , and , last week , joined @entity4 for the launch of a new @entity5 language dictionary			2
much of her time has also been spent travelling , with successful visits to the @entity142 in @entity143 and to @entity144 and @entity145 in the @entity146 alongside @entity4 , among her most recent trips			0
stylish : as is her wont , queen @entity6 cut a glamorous figure as she made her way down the @entity12 's steps @entity152 to meet you : queen @entity6 was greeted by @entity55 president @entity154 and his wife , @entity155 in @entity58 launch : she was in the @entity55 capital for the launch of an exhibition dedicated to artist , @entity88 striking : @entity88 ' most famous painting is @entity90 , which was created for @entity162			1
