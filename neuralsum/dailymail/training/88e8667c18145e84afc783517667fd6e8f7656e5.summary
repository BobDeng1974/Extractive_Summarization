families worried that their elderly relatives are being abuse by care home staff are to be given official advice on how to secretly install @entity6 cameras			1

crucial : @entity19 's son captured her abuse on @entity6			2
@entity21 was jailed for four months after he was caught abusing the 79 - year - old dementia sufferer the decision to publish official guidance helping concerned families install cameras was signed off by the @entity7 's board today			1
it is hoped that the vigilance of family members will help to maintain high standards of care for elderly and vulnerable people			1
the advice will also be aimed at managers who suspect malpractice among their staff			2
the @entity7 's chief inspector @entity38 , said : ' we know that exploring the potential use of hidden and public cameras in care homes and other care settings is a really sensitive issue – and one that provokes a huge range of debate and opinion			1
' the information we will publish for providers makes clear the issues we expect them to take into account – for example , consulting with people using the services and staff – if they are considering installing hidden or public cameras			1
' i hope the information we will publish for the public will help them make the right decisions in difficult circumstances and i look forward to making sure that this information is written in a way that is most useful for them			1
' smaller families , longer life expectancy and late parenthood in life mean the number of ' sandwich carers ' who have to care for or arrange the care of their parents as well as their children is growing but ms @entity38 added : ' i am clear that any form of surveillance can not be seen as the only way to ensure people are receiving safe , high - quality and compassionate care			1
we need enough staff , properly trained and supported who really care to ensure people get the services they have every right to expect			1
' care and support minister @entity88 , said cameras had ' helped to expose terrible cruelty and neglectful care '			1
he said : ' i welcome this new information			2
decisions about using surveillance are extremely difficult – there is always a balance to be struck between protecting people and respecting their right to privacy – but this information will help families to make the right choice for them			2
' we are committed to preventing poor care from happening in the first place and have introduced tougher standards for inspecting care services as well as measures to shut down those that are n't up to scratch			1
' @entity111 was jailed for carer ill treatment and wilful neglect after @entity115 secretly filmed @entity111 poking her mother @entity116 in the face the information from the health watchdog comes after a string of scandals in care homes which were brought to light by relatives ' undercover filming			1
in june @entity21 was jailed for four months after he was caught abusing 79 - year - old dementia sufferer @entity19 on a hidden camera installed by her son @entity128			2
he and two colleagues , @entity130 and @entity131 , were captured swearing at @entity132 and manhandling her at @entity133 , in @entity134 , @entity135			2

following the mistreatment mrs @entity116 died in may aged 92			0
the news comes as a survey found that choosing care for an elderly parent is one of the most stressful decisions we will ever make			2
it ranks higher than getting married , choosing a school , getting divorced or buying a house in terms of worry			0
smaller families , longer life expectancy and late parenthood in life mean the number of ' sandwich carers ' who have to care for or arrange the care of their parents as well as their children is growing			1
an estimated 2.4million @entity171 now have to juggle their responsibilities for both parents and children			0
some 84 per cent of the 259 men and women questioned by the poll , which was carried out by the @entity7 , said that deciding how to care for an elderly relative had been very stressful or quite stressful – making it the top choice			2
this decision could be about whether they are well enough to stay in their own home – or it could be about which care home will look after them best			1
financial worries , fears over the standard of care and guilt about putting a relative into a home were all likely to contribute to the mental turmoil			1
and many people are forced to sell their parents ' home to meet the high fees required to keep them in care			1
a care home worker was jailed and two of his colleagues received non-custodial sentences after they admitted ill - treating a 79 - year - old dementia sufferer			1
@entity207 was shown video showing a distressed @entity19 being pushed , shoved and pulled on a number of occasions , while subjecting her to a tirade of verbal abuse			0
the camera had been secretly set up by her son , who had concerns about her treatment			0
@entity21 , @entity130 and @entity131 can be heard calling the helpless pensioner a ' nasty aggressive bitch ' and telling each other to ' f * * * her ' , throughout the recordings			0
the camera placed in @entity19 's room revealed an appalling catalogue of abuse by workers at the £ 800 - a - week facility on one occasion @entity21 , 24 , attempts to force mrs @entity19 's eyes open , while on another pushes the clearly distressed pensioner onto the bed , while attempting to change her , before applying his weight on her legs to hold her down			0
@entity131 , 25 , while changing mrs @entity19 for bed , is shown to hold the nape of her neck before forcing her backwards into her chair by grabbing her chin			0
her son @entity128 set the device up to reassure himself the treatment his mother was receiving in the specialist @entity133 , in @entity134 , @entity135 , was unlike the horror stories he had read about			0
the men , who were suspended from their positions as soon as the evidence came to light , pleaded guilty to the abuse , which took place in october and december 2012			0
@entity21 , of @entity251 , was handed four months behind bars after admitting three counts of ill treatment or neglect of a person who lacks capacity , and another of theft after he was caught stealing mrs @entity19 's food			0
@entity131 , of @entity260 , @entity207 , who practised yoga while in the dock , was given two months in prison , suspended for two years after admitting three counts of ill - treatment			0

despite the sentences however mr @entity270 believes nothing will change until 24 hour cctv is placed in all homes			0
speaking afterwards he said : ' i wish i recorded nothing but good behaviour			0
that would have been the best outcome			0
' i had no reason to believe there would be problems , because she would n't have gone there in the first place			0
' i believe we 'll be seeing many more instances of the abuse of vulnerable individuals and know this will not improve until we see the implementation of @entity6 in these homes			0

public will be told how to best undertake secret surveillance of carers
official guidance will be issued in the @entity10 by care home watchdog
*campaigners* hope family members will help maintain high standards
