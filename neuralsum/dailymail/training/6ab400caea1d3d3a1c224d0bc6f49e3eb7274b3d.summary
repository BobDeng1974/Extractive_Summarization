but the idyllic landscape conceals an horrific past - a terrible massacre that took place in @entity9			1
excavations in @entity11 – at a vast ancient site near @entity13 - have unearthed evidence of a mass murder which could have involved thousands of people			1
excavated remains of the heads and necks of three late @entity20 individuals thrown into an enclosure ditch , discovered at @entity9 's largest @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity11 the excavations in @entity11 have dug up evidence of a mass slaughter involving hundreds , if not thousands , of people nearly 2,000 years ago human fingers found in rubbish dump			1
human remains from the ancient site near @entity13 have cut - marks , often in multiple rows , and at the ends of important joints more gruesome still , some of the slaughtered bodies had all the flesh stripped from their bones ( a practice known as ‘ defleshing ’ ) and were chopped up			1
this is suggested by the cut - marks , often in rows and at the end of major joints , found on the human remains			1
dr @entity46 , the @entity47 archaeologist , has headed a major excavation of @entity9 ’s largest @entity49 , @entity23			1
‘ what ’s uncharacteristic is the sheer quantity of them , ’ he said			2
‘ it ’s unusual to find this number of bodies on any archaeological site let alone from the @entity20			1
‘ it could not be more different to the hill fort ’s modern serenity of picnics and dog - walkers			2
’ archaeologists at the site say some of the bodies were even defleshed and chopped up a roundhouse entrance and two semi-articulated bodies in rubbish pits			1
@entity23 is so vast - the size of 123 football pitches surrounded by @entity20 ramparts - that only a small part has so far been excavated the remains are thought to date from the 1st or 2nd century @entity73 , although the site had been occupied for thousands of years the mutilation of the bodies suggests that they were ‘ trying to separate pieces of the body ’ , thought to date from the 1st or 2nd century @entity73 , according to dr @entity46			1
the excavation has uncovered a tiny percentage of a site that spans the equivalent of 123 football pitches , enclosed by @entity20 ramparts			0
‘ if you were to walk along the ramparts on the outside of the hillfort , you ’d be walking for over three miles , ’ @entity46 said			0
most hill forts date from the first millennium bc to the @entity92 and excavations are rare because they are protected , ancient monuments			0
however , an exception was made at @entity23 because the underlying stone is one of the most important building materials in southern @entity5 and is required for the conservation of historic buildings			1
@entity23 site contains one of the most important stone materials in southern @entity5 , used in the conservation of historic buildings in the region in return for the @entity110 being extended , an important archaeological investigation by the universities of @entity47 and @entity108 was funded			2
but the excavation has raised more questions than answers			0
the massacre is thought to have taken place around the start of the @entity118 invasion , and @entity118 weapons – sharp and heavy ballista bolts that would have been fired by catapult – were found among the bodies			2
‘ there was serious aggression on the hill , ’ said dr @entity46			0
one theory suggests that the @entity118 executed people to maintain order between indigenous tribes , but defleshing is rarely associated with them			0
instead , it was a cult of violence to the dead among @entity135 , who often put polished skulls in doorways			0
the archaeologists also excavated further into the interior of the fort , which will be open to the public for a day on saturday september 7			0
there , they uncovered evidence of domestic life , including @entity20 and @entity118 pottery and ritualistic burials , and even arrangements of human skulls			0
they also found black mustard seeds which , dr @entity46 said , are normally associated with the @entity118 : ‘ we ’re finding it in abundance			0
it means that a new food type is being cultivated and gathered ... either as a preservative or a spice			0

remains discovered @entity9 ’s largest @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity11
*experts* found evidence of mass slaughter almost 2,000 years ago
archaeologists say some of the bodies were even defleshed and chopped up
