@entity2 apps will now be scrutinised by @entity4 reviewers and come with age - based content ratings , the company has revealed			1
the announcement is a move away from the firm 's strategy to differentiate itself from @entity10 by allowing developers to immediately publish their mobile apps			1
but @entity4 added that it will not be adopting @entity10 's practice of only approving apps that meet its stringent quality standards			1
@entity4 is tightening supervision of its freewheeling play store , forming a special team to screen new apps for malware and sexually explicit material , and strengthening its age - based rating system the change underscores the growing importance of apps in the success of the companies ' rival mobile gadgets			1
@entity4 and @entity10 each manage online hubs with more than one million apps ranging from calendars to video games			1
@entity4 said in its official blog today that its expert team will screen each app submitted by developers to spot earlier anything that runs afoul of its rules			1
the developer policies exclude sexually explicit material , ' gratuitous violence , ' hate speech , gambling , ' dangerous products , ' spam and infringement of intellectual property			0
the new age - rating system will see @entity51 developers filling in a questionnaire about their app or game instead of simply choosing a rating @entity4 had only used automated technology for screening at the time of submission			1
the new process will not create bottlenecks , @entity4 said , promising that approved apps will become available on @entity2 within ' a matter of hours ' after submission			1
@entity10 does not disclose its app review period , but the website appreviewtimes.com puts the average wait time at seven days for @entity10 's @entity67			2
developers must answer special questionnaires about their apps to help independent ratings organisations assign age - based ratings , @entity4 said			1
millions of @entity51 handsets have been exposed to malware through malicious apps being offered on @entity2			0
the apps include the @entity78 card game , along with a history game and iq test , which combined have been installed more than 15 million times			0
the apps cause unwanted adverts to display on users ' phones and their abnormal behaviour sometimes does n't appear until a month after installation			0
the apps were discovered after @entity91 - based antivirus provider , @entity88 , received a user complaint			1
' this impression remains until you reboot your device and wait for a couple of days , ' wrote @entity97 , an @entity88 mobile malware analyst			0
' after a week , you might start to feel there is something wrong with your device			0
some of the apps wait up to 30 days until they show their true colours			0
' as well as @entity105 , the other other games included a @entity107 iq test with up to five million installs , and a @entity107 history app game , which has been installed up to 50,000 times by @entity51 users			0
these apps have now been removed from @entity2			0
' we know that people in different countries have different ideas about what content is appropriate for kids , teens and adults , ' @entity4 said in the blog post			2
' today 's announcement will help developers better label their apps for the right audience			0
' as of may , apps submitted without the questionnaire will not be published in @entity2 , and existing apps that do not seek a rating could be blocked in certain markets or for certain users , @entity4 said			2
@entity4 has also partnered with the @entity132 , the @entity133 and the @entity134 , to provide relevant ratings in various countries			2
until now , @entity4 has let developers rate their own apps using a system created by @entity4 .			2
