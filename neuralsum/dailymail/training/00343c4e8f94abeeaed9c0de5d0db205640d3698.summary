but how effective are the apps on offer and which will work best for you ? we asked @entity32 personal trainers @entity30 and @entity33 for their verdicts , then rated the apps for usefulness			1
best for the time - @entity38 the scientific 7 - minute workout £ 1.49 ; @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity20 an app based on groundbreaking research in the @entity45 last year that suggested a mere seven minutes ’ daily effort is enough to get you fit			1

you do each for 30 seconds , rest ten seconds , then move onto the next			0

verdict : great if you do n’t have time to go to the gym or prefer to work out at home			0
none of the moves requires equipment — all use your body weight			0
the potential for variety is limited and you might get bored			0
you would need to do this at least four to five times a week and combine with general activity such as walking for aerobic fitness			1

classes are live , but other participants ca n’t see you , though you can ask the instructor questions			1
if you miss a scheduled class , you can watch it on catch - up			1
verdict : good value compared with the price of a gym membership			0
however , people enjoy gym classes because of the social side , so the lack of contact could be crucial			1
plenty of options from beginner to advanced classes			1

verdict : excellent as a basic motivational tool and one of the simplest apps around , the detailed training maps and routes are really useful			2
much like a fitness tracker , it also calculates your pace in real time as well as working out your average and top speeds			2
@entity145 runners or walkers may want more tailored data , which costs £ 27.99 a year with the premium service			0

verdict : well - designed and simple to use , this app could prove effective for anyone who tends to lose interest after the first few weeks			2
the idea that you report back to fellow exercisers can be very motivational			0
however , it ’s targeted at the beginner and could quickly lose its appeal			0
7/10 best for yoga fans though targeted at all levels , even the more basic workouts assume some experience of yoga @entity201 yoga free ; @entity82 , @entity41 and @entity40 this provides a library of more than 50 classes with video demonstrations , music and 400 poses			1
plans come in a variety of intensities and durations			0
there are options such as ‘ office yoga to de-stress ’ and ‘ seated yoga ’ to be done at your desk or by people who are less mobile			0
verdict : though targeted at all levels , even the more basic workouts assume some experience of yoga			2
there ’s plenty of variety , but those wanting more advanced postures will need the ‘ pro ’ version of the app ( £ 22 a year )			0
yoga alone wo n’t improve all - over fitness , but it is a great adjunct to cardiovascular activities , such as running and cycling			1
5/10 @entity234 involves performing 20 seconds of an exercise followed by a ten - second rest best for the @entity238 @entity234 £ 1.49 ; tabatatrainerapp.com ; @entity41 and @entity239 @entity234 involves performing 20 seconds of an exercise — including lunges , squat jumps and press - ups — followed by a ten - second rest , repeated for four minutes in total			2

verdict : not suitable for beginners			0
there ’s also a risk that technique will suffer as you focus on speed and intensity , raising the risk of injury and muscle strains			0
these type of workouts could be demotivating or too challenging because , even though short , @entity234 is incredibly tough			2
6/10 best for indoor runners @entity267 £ 2.49 ; @entity41 and @entity82 treadmill exercise classes — done in a group — are set to be a big trend in 2015 , with gyms such as @entity272 launching them			2
this app prescribes individual running workouts set to music with varying speeds — slower for the warm - up ( which you can walk ) and faster for sprints and hill work			1
you can customise the intensity and it can be used outdoors			0
verdict : running to a beat has scientific backing — psychologists at @entity285 have shown many people find running to music easier			0
a good variety of tunes and you can add your own			0
it ’s all about running or walking , though , so you ’d need to add your own strength moves			0
