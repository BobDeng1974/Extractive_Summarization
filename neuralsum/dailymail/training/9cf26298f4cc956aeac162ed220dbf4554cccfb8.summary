equalities minister @entity2 lives in a £ 1.8 million family house in @entity7 , @entity8 , which commons authorities say is too close to @entity18 to qualify for the controversial second - home allowance			1
but mrs @entity2 is claiming the maximum amount to cover rent on a @entity4 flat because her @entity23 constituency , which is more than 40 miles from the family home , is outside the expenses ‘ exclusion zone ’			2
the arrangement has raised eyebrows because the @entity8 mp in whose constituency she lives – @entity33 @entity32 – makes the same journey as mrs @entity2 into the @entity35 , but is barred from claiming the second - home perk			1
last night mrs @entity2 , who was recently reprimanded for altering an employee ’s contract to cut his sick pay , said she was ‘ fully entitled ’ to make the claims			1
however , the revelations , contained in a @entity43 dispatches documentary due to be broadcast monday night , risks tainting the new intake of mps with the expenses controversy which erupted in 2009			2
mrs @entity2 , 50 , who entered @entity47 at the 2010 general election by winning @entity50 ’s old seat , was the first black woman selected to defend a @entity33 seat			2
the lawyer , regarded as a fast - rising @entity55 star , became a minister in the september reshuffle when she took on the dual roles of justice minister and women and equalities minister			0
the @entity43 investigation discovered that mrs @entity2 , who draws more than £ 26,000 a year from the solicitors ’ firm she established in addition to her £ 97,000 pay as mp and minister , does not have her own home in her @entity68 constituency			1
luxurious : @entity69 , home of @entity33 mp @entity2			1
it is just 19 miles from @entity47 plush : the home is worth £ 1.8million and is in the highly desirable market town of @entity7 in @entity8 instead , she travels the 19 miles from the house she shares with her husband and two children in @entity8 – bought 11 years ago for just over £ 1million , and now worth £ 800,000 more – and claims for a @entity81 flat next to @entity83 ’s headquarters			1
home number 2 : @entity2 's @entity85 flat , next to @entity87 s headquarters			2
it costs taxpayers £ 20,000 a year she has charged taxpayers the maximum £ 1,666 a month since starting to rent the property in march			0
last night , a spokesman for the @entity94 ( ipsa ) , which oversees @entity45 ’ expenses , said mrs @entity2 had acted within the rules on second homes			0
he added that it was ‘ up to mps to exercise their judgment as to how they claim their expenses ’			0
a spokeswoman for mrs @entity2 said : ‘ mrs @entity2 ’s constituency has been deemed by @entity94 to be a @entity106 constituency and she is therefore fully entitled to use her rental accommodation allowance either in @entity4 or in the constituency			0
’ earlier this month her constituency assistant @entity110 said he was disgusted after she altered his contract to cut his sick pay when he needed time off for a heart condition			0
mr @entity110 ’s contract said he was allowed up to two weeks ’ sick pay – instead of the 26 weeks he was entitled to receive			0
mrs @entity2 claimed the sick pay was docked to give taxpayers a ‘ fairer deal ’ , but the @entity35 authorities said his contract should not have been altered .			0
