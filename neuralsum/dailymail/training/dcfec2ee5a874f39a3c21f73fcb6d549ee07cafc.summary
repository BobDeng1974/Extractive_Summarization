they are a distinctive feature in @entity40 architecture and famously hold up the @entity41 on the @entity42 in @entity43			0
their elaborate hairstyles provide support to their necks that would otherwise be too thin and weak to support a heavy load			0
the @entity49 in the @entity40 tomb are made of marble and support an inner entrance into the burial plot			1

it may be the final resting place for a relative or senior official of the famous king			2
access to the third chamber was made possible after experts unearthed two sculpted female figures , known as @entity49 , last week			1
by removing a large volume of soil , behind the wall bearing the two sculpted female figures , they were able to uncover the next chamber			1
until now , experts had only partially investigated the antechamber of the tomb and uncovered a marble wall concealing one or more inner chambers			2
during initial observations , archaeologists found that the dome structure ( pictured ) has been weakened , as a result of losing a large amount of earth , and the researchers found the arched dome of the third chamber is on the verge of collapse , due to ' deep and extensive cracks ' clockwise from top right shows two headless , marble sphinxes found above the entrance to the barrel - vaulted tomb , details of the facade and the lower courses of the blocking wall , the antechamber 's mosaic floor , a 4.2 - metre long stone slab , and the upper uncovered sections of two female figures			1
the second and third chambers , not pictured , have not yet been explored during initial observations , the archaeologists found that the level of sandy soil in the third chamber is lower than in the previous two chambers			2
the dome structure has been weakened , as a result of losing a large amount of earth , and the researchers found the arched dome of the third chamber is on the verge of collapse , due to ' deep and extensive cracks ' on either side			2
before the discovery of the @entity49 , it was feared the ‘ incredibly important ’ tomb dating to the time of @entity28 had been plundered in antiquity			1
last week , archaeologists unearthed two sculpted female figures , known as @entity49 , ( pictured ) as they dug deeper at the site in the northeast of @entity4			1
the half - bodied statues made of marble have thick hair covering their shoulders and are wearing a sleeved tunic archaeologists excavating an ancient mound in northern @entity4 ( pictured ) uncovered the entrance to an important tomb some months ago			1
it is believed to have been built at the end of the reign of warrior - king @entity28 and prime minister @entity144 described the discovery as ' extremely important ’ @entity146 said that a hole in the decorated wall , and signs of forced entry , indicated it had been looted			1

last month , pictures emerged of a pair of sphinxes guarding the grave 's main entrance beneath a large arch and experts said that most of the earth around the mythical creatures had been removed to reveal part of a marble lintel with frescoes			0
chief archaeologist @entity197 said that the monument being uncovered is a unique tomb , not just for @entity4 but for the entire @entity201 peninsula , and described it as being of ‘ global interest ’			2
archaeologists were hopeful that an ancient mound in northern @entity4 could hold the remains of a senior official from the time of @entity28			1
they discovered that its entrance is guarded by a pair of sphinxes ( pictured ) but last month warned that signs of forced entry indicate it was plundered in antiquity @entity28 ( statue pictured ) was born in @entity217 , the ancient capital of @entity218 in july 356 @entity65 , and died of a fever in @entity220 in june 323 bc @entity28 of @entity221 was born in @entity217 , the ancient capital of @entity218 in july 356 bc. he died of a fever in @entity220 in june 323 bc. @entity28 led an army across the @entity226 territories of @entity227 , @entity228 and @entity229 claiming the land as he went			1
his greatest victory was at the @entity233 , now northern @entity234 , in 331 @entity65 , and during his trek across these @entity226 territories , he was said to never have suffered a defeat			0
this led him to be known as @entity28			0
following this battle in @entity233 , @entity28 led his army a further 11,000 miles ( 17,700km ) , founded over 70 cities and created an empire that stretched across three continents			0
this covered from @entity4 in the west , to @entity229 in the south , @entity246 in the north , and @entity249 @entity248 to the @entity250			0
@entity28 was buried in @entity229			0
his fellow royals were traditionally interred in a cemetery near @entity253 , far to the west			0
the lavishly - furnished tomb of @entity28 's father , @entity256 , was discovered during the 1970s			1
prime minister @entity144 added the discovery ‘ is clearly extremely important ’			0
@entity28 , who started from the northern @entity40 region of @entity218 to build an empire stretching as far as @entity249 , died in 323 b.c. and was buried in @entity229			2
his fellow royals were traditionally interred in a cemetery near @entity253 , to the west , where the lavishly - furnished tomb of @entity28 's father , @entity256 , was discovered during the 1970s			1
@entity4 's culture ministry said that earth around the sphinx statues has been removed to reveal part of a marble lintel with frescoes ( pictured ) but hopes of finding further treasures now seem to be slim the tomb is situated in @entity12 region of @entity13 in @entity4 ( marked )			1
archaeologists believe the grave may have belonged to a senior ancient official			1
while it looks largely undisturbed , there are fears that looting took place hundreds of years ago in @entity40 tradition , the mythical sphinx has the haunches of a lion , sometimes with the wings of a great bird , and the face of a human - usually a woman			0
it was described by writers as being treacherous and merciless			0
in many myths , including @entity292 , those who could not answer a riddle posed by the monster , would be killed and eaten			0
the sphinx described by the @entity297 was usually male and more benevolent			0
in both cultures , they often guarded entrances to temples and important tombs			0
the oldest sphinx found guarding a site was discovered in @entity305 and dates to 9,500 bc. but archaeologists believe the @entity12 grave , which is surrounded by a surprisingly long and well - built wall with courses of marble decorations , may have belonged to a senior ancient official			1
dr @entity197 argued the mound was originally topped by a large stone lion that was unearthed a century ago , and is now situated around 3 miles ( 5km ) from the excavation site			0
geophysical teams have identified there are three main rooms within the huge circular structure			0
in the past , the lion has been associated with @entity321 , one of @entity28 's military commanders who became governor of @entity228 after the king 's death			2
‘ the excavation will answer the crucial question of who was buried inside , ’ mr @entity144 said			0
archaeologists who fear that few treasures and clues to its owner may remain in the tomb , said that part of a stone wall that blocked off the subterranean entrance was found to be missing , while the sphinxes , which were originally six feet ( two metres ) high , lack heads and wings			2
excavator @entity197 has argued the mound was originally topped by a large stone lion that was unearthed a century ago , and is now situated around 3 miles ( 5km ) from the excavation site ( pictured )			0
the lion has been associated with @entity321 , who was one of @entity28 's military commanders			2

the tomb is situated in the @entity12 region of @entity13 in @entity4
its huge burial site is said to date back between *325* and 300 @entity65
this means it could have been built during the reign of @entity28
archaeologists have now entered the third chamber of the tomb
however , it is structurally weak and could collapse if they enter further
it is *unknown* if anything lies beyond the third chamber
two sculpted female figures , known as @entity49 , were found last week
it is thought they were *intended* to guard one of the tomb 's entrances
experts hope it holds the remains of a senior ancient official
