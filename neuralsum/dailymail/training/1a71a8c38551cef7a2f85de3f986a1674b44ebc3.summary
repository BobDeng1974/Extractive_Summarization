it ’s been almost 24 years since the body of @entity2 the iceman was unearthed , yet scientists are still discovering secrets about the 5,300 - year - old mummy			1
using a modified camera , designed to capture a range of wavelengths , experts have spotted a previously unseen tattoo on the ancient specimen			1
the markings were spotted near the ribcage on the lower right side of the body , and they are the first etchings found on the front of the torso			1
after processing the images , the researchers found unseen tattoos on @entity2 ’s lower right rib cage that are invisible to the naked eye ( original markings pictured left , scans shown right ) in total , the ancient hunter has 61 tattoos grouped across 19 body parts , which the archaeologists previously thought were used as a primitive form of acupuncture			1
however , they claim the new tattoo may contradict this theory			0
the team have mapped these tattoos in the @entity45			0
the recent scans of @entity2 ’s body were taken by @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , and @entity52 from the @entity53 of @entity54 and the @entity55			1
they used a @entity58 camera fitted with filters that captured wavelengths , including ultraviolet , visible and infrared			0
in total , the hunter has 61 tattoos grouped across 19 body parts			1
the archaeologists previously thought these markings were a primitive form of acupuncture			1
however , they now think the new tattoo may contradict this theory because it was n't found near a joint			2
the team have mapped these tattoo groups ( pictured ) this table shows the location and shape of the tattoo groups			0
they range from 1mm ( 0.03 inches ) and 3mm ( 0.1 inches ) thick and 7mm ( 0.2 inches ) and 40mm ( 1.5 inches ) long			0
the majority consist of lines running parallel to each other , but in two locations , including the right knee and left ankle , these lines form a cross using this camera , they found linear ink markings across the body , ranging from between 1mm ( 0.03 inches ) and 3mm ( 0.1 inches ) thick and between 7mm ( 0.2 inches ) and 40mm ( 1.5 inches ) long			1
the majority of the tattoos consist of lines running parallel to each other , between 2mm ( 0.07 inches ) and 8mm ( 0.3 inches ) apart			0

the right leg has seven groups of tattoos , the left leg has four , and visible tattoos are also found on the back of the lumbar region			2
the longest tattoos are around the wrist of the left hand , and many of these have been documented previously			0
however , using the modified camera , the researchers found a previously unseen group of tattoos that is barely visible			1
this tattoo was found in the lower thoracic , and shows four parallel lines varying from 20mm ( 0.7 inches ) to 25 mm ( 0.9 inches )			1
the right leg has seven groups of tattoos , the left leg has four , and visible tattoos are also found on the back of the lumbar region			2
the longest tattoos are around the wrist of the left hand , and many of these have been documented before			0
however , using the modified camera , the researchers also found a previously unseen group of tattoos that is barely visible to the naked eye			1
this tattoo was found in the right lower thoracic , and shows four parallel lines of length varying from 20mm ( 0.7 inches ) to 25 mm ( 0.9 inches )			1
‘ this is of particular interest , as this represents the first tattoo that was detected on the iceman 's frontal part of the torso , ’ explained the researchers			2
the ice man 's tattoos are largely seen on parts of the body that endured wear - and - tear , causing archaeologists to liken the practice to acupuncture			1
radiological images of the tattooed areas of the mummy show degenerative areas under the tattoos that could have caused pain			0
‘ in previous work on the tattoos of the iceman it was mainly believed that their application was done as a kind of treatment or diagnosis of health problems , in particular lower back pain and degenerative joint disease of his knees , ankle and wrist , ’ continued the experts			1
‘ the conclusion was drawn because basically all tattoos were located in morphological areas close to the underlying spine and joints , where degenerations have been identified based on earlier radiological studies			0
’ but , the newly identified tattoo is not located close to a joint , which has led them to question this theory			2
when the mummy was first studied , experts were shocked at @entity2 's tattooed skin as they had never seen real examples of @entity193 tattoos before			1
they were also surprised as it is popularly thought that acupuncture was invented more than 2,000 years later in @entity196			2
the ice man 's tattoos ( pictured ) are largely seen on parts of the body that endured wear - and - tear , causing archaeologists to liken the practice to acupuncture - an ancient treatment for joint distress			1
radiological images of the tattooed areas also show degenerative areas under the tattoos that could have caused pain @entity2 , ( artist 's impression ) was 46 when he died , and measured 5ft 2 inches			1
he had brown eyes , and tests have revealed he was lactose intolerant the 5,300 - year - old ' ice mummy ' known as @entity2 suffered from the world 's first - known case of @entity214 , a bacterial parasite spread by ticks , according to dna analysis			1
@entity2 , who was 46 at the time of his death and measured 5ft 2inches , had brown eyes , relatives in @entity221 , and was lactose intolerant			2
@entity2 was also predisposed to heart disease			0
recent research focused on the dna in the nuclei of @entity2 's cells , and it could yield further insights into the famous ice mummy 's life			1
@entity2 was unearthed in september 1991 by @entity231 tourists trekking through the @entity232 , after which he was named			0
researchers examining the contents of his stomach worked out that his final meal consisted of venison and ibex meat			0
archaeologists believe @entity2 , who was carrying a bow , a quiver of arrows and a copper axe , may have been a hunter or warrior killed in a skirmish with a rival tribe			2
researchers say he was about 159cm tall ( 5ft 2.5in ) , 46 years old , arthritic and infested with whipworm - an intestinal parasite			0
his perfectly preserved body is stored in his own specially designed cold storage chamber at the @entity55 in @entity250 at a constant temperature of -6 ° @entity252 can view the mummy through a small window			0
alongside his remains is a new @entity2 model created using 3d images of the corpse and forensic technology by two @entity261 artists - @entity262 and @entity263			2
the right leg has seven groups of tattoos , the left leg has four , and visible tattoos are also found on the back of the lumbar region			0
the longest tattoos are around the wrist of the left hand ( pictured ) @entity2 got his tattoos by enduring a series of small incisions in his skin , which were then rubbed with charcoal to make the marks			2
professor @entity280 , head of the @entity281 at the @entity282 , told @entity283 the tattoos were probably a combination of decorative art and therapy			0
archaeologists believe that judging by the clothing , tools and weapons found with the mummy frozen in the @entity293 on the @entity295 , @entity250 border two decades ago , @entity2 was a herder or a chieftain in @entity298			2
@entity2 's tattoos are the only known examples of real - life ancient tattoos , as all other examples are found in artwork at the time , and reveal how the marks were made in @entity298			1
@entity2 ( pictured ) got his tattoos by enduring a series of small incisions in his skin , which were then rubbed with charcoal to make the marks professor @entity280 said that while there might be a connection to suggest the tattoos functioned as a form of ancient acupuncture , it is difficult to see which ailments the mummy suffered from , so an indication of the marks being therapeutic is ' likely ' but can not be proven as there are not a number of similar bodies to study , found in the same location that are the same age			1
but , the @entity250 researchers are n’t ruling out that the new tattoo may have been used to treat pain as well			0
‘ it is known from previous studies that the iceman suffered from other pathological conditions that could have also caused pain in the chest area , such as gallbladder stones , whipworms in his colon and atherosclerosis			0
‘ therefore , it can not be ruled out that the iceman 's tattoos were indeed applied as a therapeutic treatment			1
’ the researchers now want to carry out further research into this tattoo and its relation to acupuncture points .			0

@entity2 's tattoos are largely seen on body parts that endured wear - and - tear
in total , 61 tattoos have been found grouped across 19 of @entity2 ’s body parts
experts used a modified camera to scan the ancient hunter 's body
they found a group of tattoos on the lower right of @entity2 's thoracic
this is the first markings found on the front of the 5,300 - year - old 's torso
experts previous thought etchings were a primitive form of acupuncture
but the latest tattoo casts doubt on this because it is not situated by a joint
