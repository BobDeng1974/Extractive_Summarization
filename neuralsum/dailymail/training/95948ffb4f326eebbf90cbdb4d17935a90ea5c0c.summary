escape : mrs @entity1 , pictured outside the inquest today , said she had grabbed kit and was trying to swim away from the boat when it caught her leg the widow of a senior television executive who died alongside their eight - year - old daughter in a bank holiday speedboat accident told his inquest of her ' big mistake ' in not using the vessel 's kill cord			1
@entity17 executive @entity16 , 51 , and daughter @entity18 had been on the boat in @entity19 , @entity20 , on may 5 , last year with the rest of their family when they were thrown into the water			1
the out of control boat continued to circle at high speed before hitting the family members , killing mr @entity16 and @entity18 , and injuring his wife @entity30 and their three other children			1
mrs @entity1 , 40 , today told the pair 's inquest in @entity35 that she regretted that neither she , nor her husband had been attached to the boat 's kill cord , a safety feature designed to cut the throttle in an emergency			1
she said mr @entity16 , the managing director of @entity17 ’s advertising sales division @entity42 who was known as @entity45 to his family and friends , had been wearing it around his ankle			1
however , when she took over the controls of the boat so that he could go to the toilet she had not attached it to herself , as they were heading back to the mooring			1
' i did n’t put it back on because i thought @entity45 was going to come back and take over , ' she told the jury at the hearing			1
' obviously that was a big mistake			0
' the @entity63 had been on holiday with their four children , @entity66 , 13 , @entity67 , 12 , @entity18 , and six - year - old kit , leaving their home in @entity70 , south - west @entity62 , for a @entity61 break just two days earlier			1
mrs @entity1 lost the lower part of her left leg in the incident , @entity66 suffered a cut hand , @entity67 a bump to her head , and kit serious injuries and needed 12 operations to save one of his legs			1
mrs @entity1 told the inquest that she had driven the speedboat - called @entity83 - about 20 times during 2012 and had completed her powerboat course on it			1
describing the build - up to the incident , she said : ' @entity45 said he needed a wee and put @entity83 into neutral and removed the kill cord from around his leg			1
i went up to the steering wheel and i had always done this to ensure that @entity68 did not interfere with the controls			2
' i stood by the steering wheel and @entity45 returned to the bow of the boat and started to play with the children			1
i was worried as the tide was going out and the boat was about halfway between @entity103 beach and @entity19 beach			1
' the sea was flat and calm and i decided to drive @entity83 back to the mooring			2
i did not put the kill cord around my leg because it was only a short distance to the mooring			1
' mrs @entity1 said she was persuaded by her children to do one last lap of the picturesque @entity112 but she protested that there was not enough room to turn			2
tragedy : @entity16 , 51 , and his eight - year - old daughter @entity18 ( left ) were in a speedboat with the rest of the family , @entity30 and children ( left to right ) @entity67 , kit and @entity66 , when they were thrown from the boat and hit by the out of control vessel as it continued to circle in the water @entity128 : the boat , seen being tailed by a local sailor attempting to bring it under control , hot the family after they fell into the water			1
mrs @entity1 said that neither she , nor her husband , had been attached to the boat 's kill cord ' as i started to drive back to the mooring , the children all called out that they wanted to go around again			1
“ @entity45 then said " turn right , turn right "			2
we were not going very fast and i did not think there was enough room to turn			2
he then grabbed the wheel with his right hand and accelerated with his left hand			1
@entity45 was standing on my left			0
' i remember the acceleration was not smooth and it jerked			2
@entity45 had never caused it to jerk in this way before			0
i remember feeling like we had hit a wall and we all fell out			2
it was so sudden , it all happened within seconds			0
' i thought afterwards maybe we had hit something to tip the six people out			2
my husband was 6ft 3in and 15 stone , something must have tipped us out			0
' i think it was the action of the boat that tipped us all out			2
it was just so sudden , we did n't have a chance			0
we were standing at one point , then the next we were in the water			0
' mrs @entity1 said her husband had tried to huddle the familit members together inside the boat 's turning circle so its propellers would avoid them			1
' we all fell into the water , ' she said			2
' kit was screaming as i grabbed him and @entity45 was telling us to stay together			0
' @entity45 was splashing about in the water , he was upset			0
he was saying ‘ stay in the middle , stay in the middle ’			0
' i could see the beach and started to swim with kit			0
the boat was going around us very fast and i think the accelerator was at its highest setting			0
“ i was not aware of where the others were but as i swam with kit the boat came straight towards me and hit me in the chest			2
it caught my leg and i saw lots of blood			0
' pausing to compose herself , mrs @entity1 continued : ' i knew i had to get out of the water			0
i did not know where anybody else was , other than kit			0
injuries : mrs @entity1 lost the lower part of her left leg in the incident , @entity66 suffered a cut hand , @entity67 a bump to her head , and kit serious injuries to his leg taking control : mrs @entity1 ( right ) told the hearing that her husband ( left ) had grabbed the wheel of the boat and accelerated , causing the boat to jerk help : a lifeboat crew , a passing boat and some canoeists , attempt to help the family in the water ' i did not see the boat hit anybody else			1
i remember a woman came to help			0
' prior to the accident i am not aware of anything to distract either of us			0
the route we took that day was one we completed every time we took the boat out and there was nothing out of the ordinary			0
' neither of us had ever made a manoeuvre when we felt unsafe or about to fall out			0
i would like to clarify that we never " wave jumped " in the estuary			0
' asked by @entity20 coroner @entity233 about falling out of the boat , mrs @entity1 replied : ' i saw the boat speed away from us - that ’s all i can remember - it all happened very quickly			1
hero : water sports instructor @entity239 risked his life by leaping onto the out of control boat after speeding to the rescue with a friend when they saw the family in the sea ' i thought maybe we had hit something			1
it was so sudden and we did n’t have a chance			0
one second we were in the boat and the next second we were in the water			0
' i was n’t aware where anyone else was			0
my survival instincts kicked in and i just grabbed @entity68 and decided to swim towards the beach			0
' earlier , the inquest heard evidence from pathologist dr @entity260			0
he said mr @entity16 died from ' significant ' head injuries , which would have been caused by either his ejection from the speedboat , impact with the water or blunt impact from the boat			1
asked about mrs @entity1 's evidence that her husband was able to shout to her while in the water , dr @entity268 replied : ' if @entity273 was in the water and moving his arms and talking and shouting , then that head injury would have occurred after that			2
' i would not have expected him to be able to do that if he had sustained that head injury during the ejection			0
' mr @entity16 was found to have 56mg of alcohol in 100ml of blood			1
the legal drink drive limit is 80mg per 100ml			0
dr @entity268 said @entity18 died from multiple injuries - particularly to her abdomen - which were also caused by her ejection from the boat , impact with the water or a blunt impact from the boat			1
the inquest heard that the boat 's propeller caused significant injuries to @entity18 but she would have already been rendered unconscious			1
' from that point of unconsciousness , she would have been entirely unaware of what was happening , ' dr @entity268 said			0
' the injuries to her abdomen were as a result of her ejection from the boat and whatever then happened to her afterwards would have been very rapidly fatal - those are not injuries she could have survived			1
