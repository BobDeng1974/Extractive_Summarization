a 21 - year - old woman has regular brushes with death and in one year was pronounced clinically dead 36 times			1
@entity4 was four years ago diagnosed with @entity7 orthostatic @entity5 ( @entity8 ) , a condition which makes her heart race while standing upright			1
she experiences rapid palpitations that regularly cause her heart to stop beating and her blood pressure to plummet to what doctors record as clinically dead			1
ms @entity4 said that she has contacted other people with the same condition , but none of those people 's hearts have stopped ' they ca n't give me cpr because cpr tires the heart out for no reason so it is pointless			1
when the heart fills up with blood again is when it begins beating again			1
' the blood tends to pool in my legs and the doors need to help feed it back to the heart			1
' ' i ca n't have oxygen because it prolongs the attack			2
' in fact it is just a case of leaving me there and praying			0
the only thing they can do is put me on a drip , ' she added			0
ms @entity4 , from @entity45 , said each time her heart stops medics have to inflict pain on her to shock her into coming back to life			1
she said : ' when it happens paramedics try and do anything to inflict pain to try and shock me into coming back to life			0
ms @entity4 lies in a hospital bed after undergoing one of her regular episodes caused by her heart condition @entity8 ( @entity8 ) can be a life altering and debilitating chronic health condition			1
simply standing up can be a challenge for people with @entity8 as their body is unable to adjust to gravity			1
@entity8 is characterised by what 's known as orthostatic intolerance - the development of symptoms when upright that are relieved by lying down			2
symptoms include headaches , fatigue , palpitations , sweating , nausea , fainting and dizziness			2
they are associated with an increase in heart rate from the lying to upright position of greater than 30 beats per minute , or a heart rate of greater than 120 beats per minute within 10 minutes of standing			2

on one occasion they ripped an acrylic nail off but that still did n't make me flinch			0
' ms @entity4 said that she has contacted people with @entity8 , but none of those people 's hearts have stopped			1
she also suffers joint hypermobility syndrome which means her joints are more prone to injury and dislocation			2
the two combined resulted in her visiting @entity101 a staggering 64 times in one year			1
' when i was still canoeing i had an attack in my boat and when i came around i was screaming before i knew it because i had somehow dislocated my shoulder and damaged my back while i was passed out			0
' but ms @entity4 - who has canoed for @entity108 - says she is determined not to let the conditions hold her back and is now trying to make a life as a burlesque performer			1
she said : ' there are signs before it happens - i 'll feel dizzy or sick and really tired and then i feel as though i 'm falling @entity116 can hear everything around me and feel as though i 'm trying to shout but nothing is coming out			1
' they say when you die your hearing is the last thing to go and that 's been my experience			0
after an attack i 'll wake up and my chest will be killing and i 'm really tired			0
' i get asked it quite a lot , but there is definitely no bright light			1
' you can still hear things and there is a voice in my head that is still active and still conscious and it is trying to communicate with those around me			2
i can remember what people are saying when i black out but have no other awareness of what 's going on			2
' she was told she could no longer take part in the sport and her dreams of joining the @entity147 were also left in tatters			0
even getting a job and and driving were affected by the condition			2
she added : ' i had 10 years of being out every weekend canoeing and being so active and it all came crashing down			0
i piled on the weight because i could n't exercise and was really upset			0
' all my dreams came crashing down , i ca n't even work at the minute because i would need a job that could be very flexible			0
then i was told i could n't drive , it was like everything was being taken away from me			0
' i lost a lot of friends , in fact i only have one friend from school			0
everyone seemed to be too busy with their own lives to bother with me when i was diagnosed			0
