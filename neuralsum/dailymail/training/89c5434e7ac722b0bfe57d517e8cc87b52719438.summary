a solid silver flute was also stolen but not recovered			2
after @entity11 admitted burglary at @entity44 , grandmother - of - three mrs @entity17 said : ‘ what that man did was downright cruel			1
‘ i feel violated that he had been rummaging about - especially after i ’d trusted him to do work			1
to think i paid him £ 400 and then he did this , it makes me sick			1
i have become quite cynical since this			2
‘ i would like to see him go to jail for what he has done			0
i want him to be punished but i fear he will get a slap on the wrist because of some personal problems he might have			0
’ the retired night care assistant added : ‘ that wo n’t stop him from doing it again and that ’s what bothers me , he could rob someone of a lot more			0
people like him are the lowest of the low			0
‘ i now do n’t trust anyone to come to my house anymore - and that ’s not fair on the honest people			2
reunited : grandmother - of - three @entity17 ( pictured ) , 65 , said she felt ' violated ' by the crime , which saw the theft of the @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity37 medals which were awarded to her grandfather ‘ it ’s sad that we live in this sort of world			1
i ’m sure my grandfather would have never have suspected this sort of callous betrayal back home when he was serving his country			1
’ medic : mr @entity28 ( right ) was dispatched to the @entity25 where he helped tend to the wounded on the battlefields and recover the bodies of the dead mr @entity28 , who fought during the @entity89 campaign against the former @entity90 , is believed to have joined the military at the outbreak of the @entity4 in 1914			1
he was dispatched to the @entity25 where he helped tend to the wounded on the battlefields and recover the bodies of the dead			0
after the war he opened a fish and chip shop in @entity97 with his late wife @entity98 and died in 1940 aged in his 60s			0
all of his medals were made of solid silver and had the surname ‘ lord ’ and initials ‘ @entity106 ’ engraved in the back of them - and had different coloured ribbons attached			1
they were kept in mrs @entity17 ’s bedroom			1
the theft occurred between march and april after @entity11 turned up unannounced at mrs @entity17 ’s home and offered to do some building work			1
she added : ‘ he did some roof work for me and fixed a gate and the back and front door			0
i suppose he was like a @entity118 - but on his van it said he was a roofer			2
‘ he came to me and said he noticed my back gate was falling to bits and the roof needed work			0
i had thought it was a @entity127 type thing , that kind of thing			0
‘ he obviously knew how to work it and i suppose i was a bit or perhaps a lot naive			0
i thought he was doing a good thing for me and working on and off for about six weeks			0
‘ on a couple of occasions he said he was going to the loo and i just did n’t realise at the time that the medals had gone and i was devastated when i found out they were missing			2
fought in @entity25 : mr @entity28 ( second right , on second - from - back row ) , who fought during the @entity89 campaign against the former @entity90 , is believed to have joined the military in 1914 ‘ these medals are very precious to me and were a vital link to the family past			1
thinking about what may happen to them makes me feel sick - especially as they had been won by someone who fought for his country			1
' what that man did was downright cruel			2
i feel violated that he had been rummaging about - especially after i ’d trusted him to do work ' @entity17 ‘ there were very sentimental to me and ( with the ) d - day commemorations , ( @entity154 ) feel sad that somebody would stoop so low as to steal war medals which had been won for great bravery			1
‘ when my grandparents were alive times were very different			0
people would not think of stealing from you - now it seems to be happening way too much			2
‘ when i got them back i was absolutely over the moon but i am very paranoid now about who comes into the house and i am always checking the locks			0
‘ i do n’t like leaving the house now			0
i used to go shopping , i liked to browse but now i make a list and get back as fast as i can			0
it has shaken me up and i feel very wary of strangers			0
medals : retired night care assistant mrs @entity17 said she no longer trusts anyone to come to her house ‘ i live by myself and it ’s made me feel uncomfortable			1
i hate being cynical but that ’s what it has driven me to			0
it ’s made me uncomfortable that someone can do that			0
‘ the man who stole his medals betrayed all those men that served in the war and sacrificed their lives to allow us all to live as we do today			2
i think most people appreciate the sacrifices they made			0
' people like him are the lowest of the low			0
i now do n’t trust anyone to come to my house anymore - and that ’s not fair on the honest people			2
it ’s sad that we live in this sort of world ' @entity17 ‘ many like my grandson are really interested in what happened			1
i would dread to think what my grandfather would have thought , having served his country , for his medals to be stolen by a horrible thief decades later			1
