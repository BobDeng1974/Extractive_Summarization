a killer who stabbed his partner and six - year - old son to death said money did not ‘ mean anything ’ to him and that ‘ happiness is the main thing in life ’ as he launched a legal battle to inherit his victims ’ estate			1
the family of @entity13 said they were ‘ very distressed ’ by @entity23 ’s claims as he attempted to use a legal loophole usually reserved for victims of domestic violence in a @entity19 bid for her £ 80,000 assets			1
@entity23 , 35 , knifed 40 - year - old @entity24 and their son @entity25 dozens of times at their family home in april last year			1
paranoid schizophrenic @entity23 has launched a bid to inherit the £ 80,000 assets of his partner @entity13 , who he stabbed to death - along with their six - year - old son - at their family home in april last year the paranoid schizophrenic was jailed indefinitely in a secure mental health unit after pleading guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility			1
by law , @entity23 is entitled to half the couple ’s £ 120,000 semi-detached house in @entity45 , @entity46 , which was largely bought with money @entity24 inherited on her mother ’s death in 2012			1
but he is battling to obtain miss @entity13 ’s half and other assets including a joint saving account and her pension fund			1
her family have described his action as a ‘ torment ’ for them			1
yesterday @entity23 gave evidence at @entity59 after being granted permission to leave the @entity62 unit near @entity63			1
wearing a crumpled red and white striped shirt and short blue tie , he said : ‘ it is not about benefiting			1
it is just obviously i have been portrayed in the papers that this is to do with money			2
i nearly took my own life			2
i have got about 20 injuries to myself and stuff			2
‘ this is to put to the courtroom that i was very unwell at the time			2
i have been through the worst that i could ever imagine			2
it ca n’t get any worse than i already have			2
‘ i have lost more than any money that can be given to me			2
i have lost more than that			2
i have not benefited in any way			2
i have lost @entity13 and i have lost my son @entity25			1
money can not take away from that			2
‘ money does not mean anything in life , happiness is the main thing in life			0
’ asked about his statement to police in which he admitted the stabbings , he added : ‘ i would never have taken the steps at all			0
it was not my hands			0
it was not me at all			0
at the time it was not my actions			0
‘ it was not me , that is all i can say			0
it was a place where i would n’t even wish it on my worst enemy			0
‘ i loved them to bits and whatever happens i have got memories of them no one can take that away from me , nobody			0
’ he later broke down in the witness box when asked about the injuries he inflicted on his son , which he insisted he had no memory of			1
representing miss @entity13 ’s family , @entity113 accused @entity23 of using the hearing to put ‘ his version of events ’ into the public domain			1
he said : ‘ it appeared from his evidence that he regarded these proceedings as a vehicle for him to put his side of the version of events			0
‘ the fact that he has brought this application for those reason in my submission counts against the jurisdiction being exercised in his favour			0
’ miss @entity13 ’s aunt @entity134 described the killings as ‘ brutal ’ and pointed out that @entity23 will still benefit from the sale of the house			1
she said : ‘ this has added to our distress			0
’ @entity23 is battling to obtain miss @entity13 ’s half of the home they owned together and other assets including a joint saving account and her pension fund			1
her family have described his action as a ‘ torment ’ for them before the hearing @entity23 made a bid to hold the proceedings in private			1
representing him , @entity155 , told judge @entity156 : ‘ he is concerned he has been portrayed as some sort of money - orientated individual who is callously in pursuit of funds to which he has no rightful claim			0
’ he said his client ‘ wanted to get something back in terms of recognition ’ that his actions did not reflect his character			0
judge @entity170 said the default position was of open justice , and it was ‘ in everybody ’s interests ’ that the case was heard in public			0
the court heard how @entity23 had been acting ‘ strangely ’ and appeared ‘ paranoid ’ in the week before the killings in 2013			1
he stabbed his partner of 11 years 32 times and his son 25 times on april 9 , before turning a knife on himself and falling down the stairs in a botched suicide attempt			1
a pathologist ’s report revealed both victims showed signs they had defended themselves and had smaller wounds that showed @entity23 had ‘ prodded ’ them with a knife while they were alive			1
his mother @entity194 called police after seeing miss @entity13 ’s body through the letterbox when she visited the house because the family had failed to meet her as planned			0
she told the hearing : ‘ i was shouting all their names and there was n’t a sound in the house at all			0
i was on the phone to the emergency services , the next thing i saw was @entity23 with a very white face falling down the stairs			1
’ after giving evidence , mrs @entity211 , who wept during her son ’s testimony , said : ‘ can i just mention that they were very loved and they all loved each other			1
she was like a daughter to me @entity13			0
’ the law states those convicted of murder or manslaughter can not inherit from their victims or profit in any way from their crimes			0
but under the @entity228 of 1982 , there is clause allowing this to be ‘ modified ’ due to exceptional circumstances in the conduct of the offender or deceased			0
for example , if a battered wife who has suffered years of violence at the hands of her husband suddenly retaliates , accidentally killing him , she may still be able to inherit his estate .			0

@entity23 is jailed indefinitely in a secure mental health unit
he is battling for control of the home and assets he *shared* with his partner
in april last year he knifed her and their son to death at their home
