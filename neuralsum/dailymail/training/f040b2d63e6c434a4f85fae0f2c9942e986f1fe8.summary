by @entity0 published : 05:41 est , 18 july 2012 updated : 06:23 est , 18 july 2012 the parents of a seven - year - old boy who has already beaten cancer once , are trying to raise £ 250,000 for further life - saving treatment because the disease has returned			2
@entity6 has such an aggressive form of cancer that treatment available in the @entity10 will only keep him alive for a matter of months			1
but a specialist has offered his parents @entity13 and @entity15 a lifeline – a place on a clinical trial in @entity19 which would improve @entity6 ’s chance of survival by 75 per cent			1
' incredibly brave ' : @entity6 has already battled neuroblastoma once @entity6 plays around in hospital			1
he has been battling ill health for three years the couple has just 33 days to find the cash to take their son abroad or he will lose his @entity29 , 40 , said : ' as a parent , you will jump through every hoop and do absolutely anything for your child			2
' @entity6 is an incredibly brave boy and he keeps us all strong			1
he is a happy , bright , energetic kid who is loving , caring and incredible in every way			2
he deserves a shot at life			2
' mr @entity6 , who was an environmental health technician with the @entity40 for 22 years , quit the @entity41 last year to spend more time with his children - @entity6 and sister @entity44 , three			1
he said : ' i want to spend every moment i have with them			0
i ca n’t contemplate life without them			0
' a fundraising drive has now been launched to help @entity6 get to @entity19 by august 20			1
it is being supported by his namesake chef @entity52 who has asked his two million @entity54 followers to dig deep			1
he said : ' you just look at his parents in admiration and wish them all the very best			0
@entity6 is gorgeous beyond belief			1
' @entity6 has the support of @entity52 who called on his two million @entity54 followers to help @entity6 with his parents and sister @entity44 in 2010 after first treatment was successful mr @entity6 said he was hopeful that they would get the money in time but added : ' the demoralising thing about the mission is that this is the second time we have been down this road			1
it is the second time we have had to ask for money because we ca n’t get the medical care we need from the @entity74			0
' @entity6 was first diagnosed with neuroblastoma when he was four			1
a hospital ultrasound revealed he had a large tumour in his abdomen and his devastated parents were told he had just a 30 per cent chance of surviving			0
but the couple refused to give up and after researching the condition , discovered they could get pioneering treatment in the @entity85 which would dramatically improve the odds			0
but again , it came at a price			0
they spent a year fundraising and managed to scrape together the £ 400,000 they needed to begin the antibody procedure in @entity93			2
' we never thought it was going to be possible to get that sort of money together , ' said mrs @entity29 , 37 , at the family home in @entity100			0
' what happened was that we received donations from people worldwide and it was truly humbling			0
' the treatment in 2010 started with eight courses of chemotherapy , an operation to remove the tumour and a kidney and a ninth high - dose course of chemotherapy designed to kill any remaining cancer cells and wipe out his white blood cells , which fight disease			2
stem cells that had been harvested from his body months earlier were then transplanted back into his body to rejuvenate his immune system before he could begin the actual antibody treatment in the @entity85			0
incredibly the treatment was successful			0
having fun : @entity6 with his mother @entity15 @entity6 's parents hope to get him onto a clinical trial running in @entity19 in august @entity6 ’s hair started to grow back , his smile returned and he even enrolled as a pupil at @entity132 , in @entity133 at the start of 2011			1
mr @entity6 , said : ' we were optimistic and with every month that he stayed cancer - free we felt more confident that we had beaten it			1
' but four months ago @entity6 started to complain about back pain and collapsed at the family home , unable to walk			1
he was rushed back to hospital and a scan revealed the cancer had returned			2
he had emergency surgery to remove a tumour from his spine but after discussions with @entity147 and @entity74 , the family were told that there was no treatment available in this country to tackle this type of relapse effectively and that they were not eligible for funds to get the treatment abroad			0
@entity6 ( left ) before he fell ill and during treatment ( right )			1
he has remained cheery throughout his ordeal mr @entity6 said : ' we begged them to help us get the £ 250,000 we needed to take @entity6 to @entity19 and had the full support of our doctor			1
it was heartbreaking when we were turned down			0
' unfortunately it means we are having to beg and borrow again			0
we took a year to get the money we needed when @entity6 got sick the first time but this time round we have just four weeks			1
it is particularly difficult to ask for help a second time round after people have already been so generous but we honestly believe this is our son ’s last hope			0
' dr @entity172 , medical director for @entity173 and @entity100 said : ' @entity174 makes decisions about whether to fund treatments that we do not routinely commission			0
' the panel , which consists of a range of professionals including doctors , takes into account the clinical and cost effectiveness of such treatments			0
the panel may decide to fund treatments under exceptional circumstances , depending on the evidence provided in support of the case			0
' we have a responsibility to ensure that we provide the best possible healthcare for the largest number of patients within the limited resources available			0
unfortunately , this means that we are not able to fund some specialist treatments for which there is limited clinical evidence to support their clinical effectiveness			0
' around 120 children a year in the @entity10 are diagnosed with neuroblastoma , a cancer that forms in nerve tissue			1
@entity208 for @entity209 @entity10 said : ' we know high - risk neuroblastoma is an incredibly difficult cancer to treat successfully , and no amount of money can secure a successful outcome			1
' at present , however , parents see a system that gives up on their children too soon , whilst there should still be hope			2
elsewhere such hope is supported by a system that continues to treat children long after the @entity10 has nothing to offer but palliative care			2
