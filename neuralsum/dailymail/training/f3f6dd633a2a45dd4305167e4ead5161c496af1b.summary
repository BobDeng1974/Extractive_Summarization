by @entity0 published : 09:08 est , 3 june 2013 updated : 12:41 est , 3 june 2013 it was meant as a small token of appreciation to mark 33 years of tireless service from a longstanding @entity6 employee			2
but the broadcaster 's bosses did not take kindly when a colleague tried to treat legendary football commentator @entity10 to a £ 36.65 bottle of champagne on his retirement			1
the corporation refused to sign off the expenses claim - which equated to little more than £ 1 for every year of work - made by senior broadcast journalist @entity16			1
falling flat : the @entity6 has been accused of a lack of common sense after refusing to pay for a @entity21 gift for retiring commentator @entity10 , pictured front left celebrating with colleagues the @entity6 's rather ungracious and mean - spirited treatment has provoked a backlash from staff , with mr @entity16 accusing senior executives of a lack of common sense			1
he said : ' the end of the football season marked the end of an era for @entity33			0
' our @entity35 commentator @entity10 retired after 33 years of following the team , home and away			1
' to mark the occasion - i wanted to make him feel special - i bought a magnum of champagne ( £ 36.65 - on special offer - a third off at @entity45 ) to present to him at the end of an hour - long interview about his time with us			0
thanks but no thanks : @entity6 bosses have come under fire for refusing to put on expenses a £ 36 bottle of @entity21 to mark the retirement of a longstanding employee ' as you can imagine , @entity10 was thrilled			1
' i was rather less so when i came to claim for the champers - it was refused on these grounds : ' 1.5.3 gifts for artists and contributors : if there is a valid business reason , gifts such as flowers ( but not champagne ) may be given to talent and the cost must be reclaimed through expenses			2
' ' so i could n't reward a valued contributor with a bottle of fizz that equated to approximately £ 1 for every year of his service to the @entity6			1
' can we not apply some common sense to the policy ? ' i understand why we ca n't be seen to be spending vast amounts on champagne ( although flowers appear to be fair game ) but £ 36.65 does n't seem too extreme			1
' the @entity6 decided to implement a ban on champagne after provoking a storm of criticism when it emerged that between 2007 and 2011 it splashed out on 9,000 bottles of champers , spending a total of £ 103,667 on bubbly			1
the vast sums included £ 200 on a bottle of @entity95 and more than £ 1,000 on 11 bottles of @entity97			0
during a five - year period , the @entity6 got through an average of 690 bottles of wine , 150 bottles of champagne or sparkling wine and 1,417 bottles or cans of beer or cider every month on one occasion , @entity6 staff splashed out £ 200 on a single bottle of premium champagne : @entity95 1995 it imposed a blanket ban on staff buying champers in 2012 - with none at all claimed on expenses by staff last year			1
banned : the @entity6 banned @entity21 after it emerged the corporation spent £ 103,667 on the drink in a few years mr @entity10 retired in april this year after commentating for @entity33 on every @entity35 game - home and away - for the past 33 years			1
the commentator had devoted his working life to the @entity6 covering matches for the @entity126 team since 1980			2
mr @entity10 was honoured by the club when he retired earlier this year by former @entity35 midfielder @entity128 , who played for @entity35 393 times between 1995 and 2005			2
mr @entity128 said in april this year : ' he 's wonderful fella and he 's got a real love for pools			0
' it 's sad that he 'll no longer be commentating on the games on the radio but you can bet he 'll be keeping a keen interest in the club so it 's great that they 've given him a @entity139			0
' he 's become part of the fixtures and fittings at @entity143 so it will be strange not seeing him in the press box or hearing him on the radio but i wish him all the best in his retirement			0
' a @entity6 source said today : ' the ban on champagne was imposed after 9,000 odd bottles were bought in five years , but that was mainly for lovvies and big bosses trading bottles with each other			2
' this guy has been working here for more than 30 years and deserves something for his devotion			0
ok , he got the champagne , but the poor sod who bought him it is out of pocket			0
' a @entity6 spokesman said : ' in the interests of delivering value for money for the licence fee payer we do not buy champagne for departing contributors or staff			0
' departments often arrange collections for contributors or employees who are leaving the @entity6			0
