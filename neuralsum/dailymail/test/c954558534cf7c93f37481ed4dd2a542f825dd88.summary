not one but two fast food eateries have announced major menu shake - ups , both in an apparent attempt to attract a new sort of crowd			2
@entity5 , which has launched its summer menu , has branched out from run - of - the - mill sundaes by offering a pina colada smoothie , while @entity9 has gone the whole hog and started serving sit - down dinners with wine			1
the @entity15 sandwich chain 's new concept is called ' @entity16 ' , and runs from 6pm until 11pm every night , but only ( for now ) at its branch on @entity19 in @entity20			0
wining and dining : @entity9 's new concept ( pictured ) is called ' @entity16 ' , and runs from 6pm until 11pm every night , but only ( for now ) at its branch on @entity19 in @entity20 @entity9 , which up until now has been solely a breakfast and lunch operation , allows customers to order at the tills but be served at tables decked out in smart crockery and silverware			2
diners can enjoy their meals along with a selection of wines and craft beers as atmospheric jazz wafts from the speakers			0
chef @entity37 told @entity38 : ‘ if [ customers ] come in and say “ we ’re in a real hurry we ’ve only got 20 minutes ” because they are going to the theatre we tell them they ’ve got plenty of time to order , sit down and have their meal			0
‘ but equally if someone ’s got a bit longer to have a glass of wine and spend an hour with us that ’s fine as well , we ’re pretty relaxed about it			0
' newcomers : @entity5 , which just launched its summer menu , has branched out from run - of - the - mill sundaes by offering a pina colada smoothie ( right ) grub : @entity5 's new party in the @entity62 menu consists of three new burgers , the @entity64 , the @entity65 and the @entity66 ( pictured ) evening dishes , which largely feature on @entity9 's lunch menu anyway , include spicy meatballs , flat breads and dips , and baked falafel , as well as @entity73 pulled pork and mac ‘ n ’ cheese			1
@entity5 's new party in the @entity62 menu consists of three new burgers : the @entity64 , the @entity65 and the @entity66			2
alongside its new @entity77 - essentially chip - shaped fried chicken - the fast - food joint is serving three new frozen drinks : the @entity80 , the @entity81 and the aforementioned @entity82 - which is alcohol - free			1
it comes shortly after @entity84 's announced its most extensive menu update yet , with new options including its @entity87 , a ' @entity88 ' made from beetroot , carrot and spiced yogurt dressing , and a @entity93 - inspired @entity92			0
@entity84 's also recently announced its most extensive menu update yet , with new options including a @entity87 ( bottom right ) , a ' @entity88 ' ( top right ) and a @entity93 - inspired @entity95 ( top left ) @entity9 is now in good company with its lead competitor , @entity98 , who in february announced the launch of its yet - to - materialize dinner menu			1
@entity101 , as it has been coined , will offer a range of hot and cold meals as well as wines and beers to customers , to be served from 4pm			0
@entity107 in @entity108 will be the first @entity15 location to offer the evening menu , with plans to expand the programme to additional stores			0
@entity98 @entity15 will also be launching an evening menu , offering ten types of wine plus hot and cold small plates options will include @entity119 , @entity120 and @entity122 cheese platter with oat cakes and aromatic plum chutney ( pictured ) @entity98 ' announcement - and no doubt now @entity9 's - did cause a bit of a stir with certain alcohol - related charities , who expressed concern that such a large firm is licensing some premises			1
@entity134 , of @entity135 , said : ‘ we hope @entity98 will take their responsibility as an alcohol retailer very seriously by ensuring the training of staff and under - age checks are adequate , and that responsible drinking is encouraged			2
' it ’s a bit disappointing to see another establishment now selling booze which will limit those customers who are in recovery or just wanting an alcohol - free environment			1

@entity5 is now offering alcohol - free pina colada smoothies
@entity9 has launched wine - accompanied sit - down dinners
@entity157 has introduced a *quinoa* salad and a posh new *coleslaw*
@entity98 is also *trialling* a dinner service with wine
