to be a competent radio newsreader takes a particular skill and talent but for @entity3 it is even more challenging with the hurdles of a vision impairment and little sensitivity in her fingertips			1
the 26 - year - old , from @entity10 , has an inconceivable four streams of audio feeding through her headphones during the three - minute live news bulletins on @entity15 which would be enough for anyone to throw in the towel			1
but @entity3 , who also writes and cuts her own segments , reads the live reports effortlessly like a true professional despite not being able to read braille due to her condition			1
the four different streams of audios when live on radio is a voice telling her what to say during the bulletin , her voice throughout the microphone reading out the news , the grabs that have been packaged before going to air , and finally a clock telling her exactly when to start and finish			2
' it has taken the better part of four years to get it down pat and it 's still not perfect - i can hear a voice telling me what to say so i listen and read at the same time , ' she tells @entity68			2
' i 've got to be careful not to lag too far behind - it 's got to be a split second after i hear it that i say it - so it 's not a perfect system but it works quite well for the most part			0
' needless to say by the end of a long working week , her ears need a well - earned rest from the sensory overload describing the experience as constantly stuck in ' busy traffic '			0
' there is a lot going on and at the end of the week i feel like i need some quiet time , ' she said			0
at just six months old , blood vessels burst in the back of her eyes which caused them to detach from the retina leaving her with only vision of shadow and light			0
to add to her difficulties , @entity3 struggled to grasp reading braille until it was discovered when she was ten years old that she has @entity99 - a delayed sensitivity in the hands and feet due to the nerve endings			1
' it was frustrating before being diagnosed because there was an assumption that i was lazy or not very intelligent , ' she said			0
' it takes a second for my hand to register it 's on a kettle that is hot or i will be walking along sand that is really hot but it might take my feet a little while to register			0
' @entity3 has always wanted to be a journalist since she was a child when she read newspapers @entity3 out on in the field interviewing the mayor in @entity30 , in rural @entity31 , a few years ago @entity3 insists she would still be the same driven personality if she had her sight but admits her impairment has pushed her to be that bit stronger			1
' to a certain extent i think fundamentally i 'm a pretty determined , enthusiastic , pushy person anyway so i do n't think that has really changed because of my vision impairment , she said			1
' but i 've obviously had a lot more to prove than other people had when they approached employers for a job			0
' when @entity3 first started looking for work while still at university she was met with a lot of negativity from potential employers			2
her tactic was she would n't mention in her application that she was visually impaired but would explain her situation if she received a call back			0
' the fact that i have a vision impairment is nothing to me - there 's no reason why i should n't be looked at but it 's something that other people have found a bit confronting so it 's nice to be able to get people come around to the idea , ' she said			1
she encountered negativity while looking for work at university but that did n't stop her from achieving her goal a keen jetsetter , @entity3 's dream job would be to work as a travel writer thanks to great persistence it only took @entity3 six months to look for a full time job when she landed a cadetship at the @entity33 in 2011 and has never looked back			1
following her 12 - month training across all mediums , she was sent to do regional post in @entity167 , in rural @entity31 , for a year before landing a role as a newsreader with @entity15 although she finds it surprising that people see her as an inspiration - she happily takes on that role			1
' i became a journalist because it 's what i love to do but it 's also nice to know i can help break that mould and hopefully get other people with disabilities employed as well , she said			0
she has always wanted to be a reporter since she was a child when she loved reading the newspaper			0
a keen jetsetter , @entity3 's dream job would be to work as a travel writer which some people might question as she ca n't describe what she is seeing on her adventures			1
' using vision as a form of travel is narrow way of looking at things , ' she said			2
' you can describe the food you ate , the kindness of the people , the smells around you and the feeling of the sand on your feet			0
' @entity3 said using vision as a form of travel is a narrow way of looking at things			2
