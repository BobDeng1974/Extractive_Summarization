hard - pressed businesses face costly bills after @entity3 judges controversially ruled that obesity can be classed as a disability			1
companies will be forced to make concessions for overweight staff that could include extra-large office furniture , medical advice or exercise facilities			1
firms could also face expensive compensation claims for discrimination if they sack someone for being overweight			2
critics warned it could encourage the overweight to avoid slimming down in the hope of securing a payout			2
companies could also face millions of pounds of costs to alter offices and factories , including providing : the @entity48 ( @entity48 ) ruled that obesity qualified as a disability if it ' hinders the full and effective participation of the person … on an equal basis with other workers ' when doing their job			1
health campaigners and business leaders criticised the ruling , binding across the @entity21 , with one saying it was the closest they had seen to the ' law being an ass '			0
@entity63 spokesman @entity62 said : ' this has opened a can of worms for all employers			0
they will be required to make adjustments to their furniture and doors and whatever is needed for very large people			2
it will cause friction between obese people and other workers			0
' the top @entity3 court was asked to rule on a case brought by unions and lawyers on behalf of 25st childminder @entity81 , 50 , who claimed he was sacked by his local authority in @entity23 in 2010 for being too fat			1
the council allegedly claimed his weight meant he was unable to perform basic duties and even required help from a colleague to tie children 's shoelaces			1
@entity23 asked the @entity48 to determine whether @entity21 law outlawed discrimination on the grounds of obesity , along with factors such as religion , belief , age or sexual orientation			1
if a person had long - term medical problems because of their condition , for example joint problems or diabetes , they would be protected by the @entity21 's @entity107			1
but mr @entity81 , who has a body mass index of 54 – almost twice the official obesity level – said he did not believe he was disabled			0
a quarter of adults in @entity112 are clinically obese			0
@entity113 , of the @entity114 , said : ' businesses will be looking for a common sense approach to this ruling , as employees need to be able to do their job			0
it is unclear from the ruling what it would be reasonable to expect employers to do , so the government will need to work with businesses to establish clear guidelines and avoid unfair costs being levied on firms			0
' though mr @entity81 claims his weight was mentioned in a meeting discussing his dismissal , his employers deny it was a reason for terminating his contract			0
the @entity23 court asked the @entity21 court to specify whether @entity21 law prohibits discrimination on the grounds of obesity and whether obesity can constitute a disability @entity143 , calculated from a person 's weight and height , is accepted as a reliable indicator of obesity			1
according to the @entity150 , the ideal @entity143 for most adults is between 18.5 and 24.9			0
if a person 's @entity143 is 25 to 29.9 , they are classed as overweight			1
at between 30 and 39.9 they are obese and 40 or over is very – or morbidly – obese			0
doctors say being overweight or obese can increase the risk of health problems , including heart disease , strokes , type 2 diabetes and some cancers			0
earlier this year the @entity48 's advocate general , @entity160 , who advises the court , suggested that very severe obesity – classified as a @entity143 of more than 40 – could be considered a disability			1
but yesterday 's ruling does not state what level of obesity would be classed as ' disabled '			1
it stated : ' it is for the national court to determine whether [ an individual 's ] obesity falls within the definition of ' disability '			1
' @entity174 , chairman of the @entity175 , said obesity should not be categorised as a disability			1
she said : ' i think the downside would be that if employers suddenly have to start ensuring that they 've got wider seats , larger tables , more parking spaces for people who are obese ... we 're just making the situation worse			1
' [ it is ] implying that people have no control over the condition , rather than something that can be improved by changing behaviour			0
' @entity193 , employment partner at law firm @entity195 , said : ' this ruling is a real problem for employers			0
it 's still not clear enough for them to be sure that they 're going to be on the right side of the law			0
' this test could mean that businesses face claims from obese staff for failing to make reasonable adjustments to their role if the job entails tasks where they would be on an unequal footing with other staff – tasks that require full mobility such as stacking shelves in a supermarket			2
' employers will need to consider whether they make adjustments for obese staff to protect themselves from discrimination claims			0
' weight loss expert @entity220 , who presents tv 's @entity221 , said : ' the world has gone crazy			2
it is an insult to those people who are genuinely disabled			0
' being obese is self - inflicted – when people fall into bad habits , we are ourselves responsible to take action to reverse that			0
' if we say being obese is a disability , there is a danger it will encourage people to stay fat to enjoy a life on benefits and celebrate the joy of getting a free car parking space			2
' according to the @entity150 , a person is obese if their body mass index – calculated using weight and height – is over 30			2
firms will not need to carry out alterations at work in anticipation of employing obese people , but would be expected to deal with individuals on a case - by - case @entity251 already states that businesses must pay for reasonable changes to the workplace to meet the needs of disabled employees , and this enjoys business support			1
a government spokesman said : ' today 's judgement does not change anything and does not mean someone can claim benefits simply for being obese			2
' the @entity48 in @entity266 , ruled that if obesity could hinder ' full and effective participation ' at work then it could count as a disability			1

the @entity48 ruled obesity can be classed as a disability
if a person 's weight hinders ' full and effective participation ' at work then it can count as a disability , judges today ruled
