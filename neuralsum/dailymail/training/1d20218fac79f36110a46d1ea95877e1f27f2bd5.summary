@entity0 will collect her 100th cap on sunday when @entity2 stages its first @entity4 women 's international against @entity5 but a far greater prize is locked in her sights			1
the playmaker has predicted @entity10 's team can win the @entity11 in @entity12 next summer , burying memories of their sorry @entity15 group - stage elimination			1
' i think so , ' @entity16 confidently told @entity18 , when asked if @entity4 could lift the trophy			1
@entity0 ( left ) with @entity20 ( right ) in 2013 , who played his 100th @entity4 game last week @entity0 is set for her 100th appearance when the @entity4 women 's team play @entity5 on sunday ' i believe we 've got a great squad , i believe we 've got a good manager and i believe we 've got a great support staff			1
we 're all moving in the right direction			0
' @entity16 , at the age of 27 , has already played five major summer tournaments for @entity4 , going closest to silverware in 2009 when after knock - out wins over hosts @entity34 and @entity35 the team bossed by @entity36 were overwhelmed 6 - 2 by @entity5 in the @entity38 final			1
@entity5 , who retained their @entity41 title last year , again pose the opposition in sunday 's friendly			2
the world 's second - ranked side , a sliver behind the @entity46 by @entity48 's reckoning , present @entity4 with their toughest challenge of manager @entity10 's reign , which began in december			2
@entity16 portrays the current squad as credible challengers to the world 's elite			2
' i think it 's a more rounded team , ' she said , ' and it 's in a stronger position mentally and physically			0
' if i get out there on the pitch it will be a special moment for me personally but i just think it 'll be a special moment for the team - to be the first @entity4 women 's team to play at @entity2			1
' @entity16 has appeared at an array of primarily @entity68 grounds in home @entity4 matches , with @entity2 out of reach until the @entity72 proposed this weekend 's showcase			1
targeting an attendance of 30,000 , the @entity72 reluctantly halted ticket sales once they soared to 55,000 a fortnight ago , mindful nearby @entity75 line closures could cause travel chaos			0
@entity16 ( centre ) celebrates scoring for @entity4 against @entity34 in @entity80 @entity81 ( second left ) with @entity82 ( left ) , @entity83 ( second right ) and @entity84 ( right ) at the @entity85 @entity16 would relish more @entity2 outings , having tasted the atmosphere when playing for @entity88 in the victory over @entity90 at the @entity85 , before over 70,000 fans			1
but as she recognises : ' that 's something we ca n't control			0
i 've had a great 99 games at other venues			0
hopefully there 's plenty more times that we can play at @entity2 and this wo n't be the last			2
' @entity16 made her international debut as a 17 - year - old , coming off the bench and scoring in a 4 - 1 win over @entity107 at the @entity108 in @entity109 in february 2005			1
' i remember it vividly , ' she said , ' from the warm - up to the moment i went on , to the song that was playing when i was warming up at half - time - @entity115 's it 's like that			0
' @entity117 prompting behind @entity4 's strikers has seen @entity10 label @entity16 an ' incredible football talent , in my eyes one of the best in the world '			2
as @entity16 puts it : ' he seems to have got the best out of me , and that breeds confidence - something i 've lacked in the past			2
' he 's given me the belief to go on the pitch and express myself and play to my strengths , and not to be too worried about weaknesses - literally just to go and have fun			0
i 've loved every moment i 've played under him			0
' @entity16 ( left ) in action against @entity107 on her @entity4 debut in @entity109 in 2005 at the age of 17 the desperate denouement of @entity141 's 15 - year reign in @entity142 last year may have been a necessary nadir			1
' everyone has to go through a transition period , ' @entity16 said			0
' hopefully we 've gone through ours and come out of it stronger			0
' we 'll give it our best shot against @entity5 and if we get the right result that 's fantastic , and if not we 've got six months to get it right for the @entity11			0

@entity0 will play her 100th @entity4 game on sunday at @entity2
she is targeting @entity11 *glory* in @entity12 next year with @entity4
