the latest triumph for @entity2 engineering – @entity4 ’ clinching of the @entity6 world constructors ’ championship – will earn each of the team ’s 700 staff a bonus of at least £ 10,000 each			1
everyone from the cleaners up to the superstar drivers , @entity15 and @entity16 , will be rewarded after @entity4 ’ blitz to glory at last sunday ’s @entity19			1
it is the first time @entity4 have won the constructors ’ title , and they did it in great style with nine one - two finishes and victories in 13 of the 16 grands prix , just shy of @entity28 ’s 1988 record			1
@entity4 trio @entity15 ( right ) , executive director @entity29 ( centre ) and @entity16 ( left ) all of @entity4 ' staff will receive a bonus fee believed to be in the region of £ 10,000 @entity15 is currently top of the drivers ' world championship standings ahead of his @entity4 team - mate 1			1
@entity46 - 0 their nearest challengers @entity38 , who also paid their staff £ 10,000 when they won the championship , are out of contention with three races remaining			1
although the base rate for the @entity4 staff is £ 10,000 , it is understood that figure could be even greater for some of the workforce			1
exactly how much more they pocket will be determined at an annual review in the new year			2
the total prize fund for winning the title is a massive £ 40million			2
much of the total amount will be ploughed into the budget for future years			2
@entity4 motorsport boss @entity66 and non-executive chairman @entity67 addressed the team 's employees at their @entity71 headquarters on monday with @entity15 and @entity16 , who are in direct competition for the drivers ' prize , expected to visit the factory on tuesday for a breakfast of champions - a bacon sandwich			1
@entity4 ’ win is another example of @entity2 ’s engineering hegemony in @entity6			1
most of the teams are based in the ‘ motorsport valley ’ in the @entity85			0
so the @entity4 bonuses represent a near annual boom time for the area 's bathroom , kitchen and carpet fitters			1
as well as the design of the winning car being carried out at @entity71 , their supreme engine is manufactured at @entity96 under the direction of @entity99 @entity98			0
the team was put together by @entity101 before he left as part of an ugly coup d’etat at the end of last season			2
the debt they owe @entity108 is considerable			0
@entity4 boss @entity66 ( right ) has lavished praise on former team principal @entity101 no wonder @entity66 paid a fulsome tribute to him			1
‘ i have to pinch myself sometimes that we are part of the @entity4 history			2
we won the first constructors ' title for @entity118 , ever , ' he said			2
‘ i feel proud and honoured to be part of the team			0
the foundations of the team were built by @entity101 , he played such an important role in the team			0
' the steps that were done in 2012 , the people that joined in 2012 , we 're important , and since then we were on an upward slope			0
’ however , @entity66 ’s words could be thought slightly hollow			0
it was he who controversially forced @entity108 out , having bought his way into the team			0
technical chief @entity29 was also drafted in behind @entity101 's back			0
@entity101 left @entity4 at the end of the 2013 @entity6 season but his influence is still evident @entity101 , who turns 60 next month , is lost to @entity6 , and indulging his love of fishing , though he has been invited to the team 's @entity140			1
the focus in the final rounds in @entity144 , @entity145 and @entity146 is now on a straight fight between @entity15 and @entity16			0
just 17 points separate the pair – next to nothing with the points at the last race on november 23 counting double			0
@entity38 ’s @entity153 , who was seventh in @entity154 , is 92 points behind @entity15			2
so big a gulf is that that his boss @entity158 has conceded his chances are close to zero			0
' @entity153 would have to win all three remaining grands prix and the @entity4 drivers not finish , ’ said @entity158			1
‘ it is just between @entity15 and @entity16 now			0

@entity4 clinched @entity6 world constructors ' championship on sunday
everyone from the cleaners up to the superstar drivers will be rewarded
nearest challengers @entity38 are out of contention with three races left
