the @entity1 are fourth in the @entity4 ahead of saturday 's trip to @entity6			1
boss @entity7 spent a reported Â£ 31million in the summer which was been dwarfed by the expenditure of @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13			1

@entity1 were fourth bottom on 14 points this time last year but @entity0 is revelling in being one of this season 's surprise packages			1
' it 's good , teams have spent a lot of money and people expected them to be in the top four because of what they 've spent but it does n't always work that way , ' he said			2

sometimes you see players coming to the @entity4 struggle to adapt			1
it 's a big plus for us			2
' @entity7 has transformed @entity1 from relegation candidates to a side pushing for @entity50 @entity51 scored twice as @entity1 beat @entity52 3 - 1 at @entity53 last weekend @entity54 and the @entity1 have shocked the top dogs during the first half of the season and @entity0 reckons breaking the ' big four ' stranglehold on the @entity60 spots is important			1
' i think it would be good for the league , ' he said			0
' if you looked at the league at the minute you 'd say it was false but we 're there on merit , we 've done well and we 've played some big teams and played them off the park on the day			0
' we 've beaten @entity13 and @entity73 and ground out a win against @entity75 , which we would have lost last season			0
we have shown good qualities			0
' @entity78 , who has netted seven times , has been a revelation since joining from @entity81 in the summer the @entity1 head to the @entity83 on saturday with @entity84 winger @entity0 insisting they can maintain their @entity50 challenge thanks to their extra quality			1
' we have to look at each game as it comes			0
it 's a big thing for us , @entity89 , hopefully we can get lucky with injuries and suspensions , ' said the 30 - year - old			2
' we had a difficult year last year , found it hard and were sucked in ( to the relegation scrap ) so this year we 're playing with confidence			0
