pope @entity0 has angered the @entity2 government by describing the mass - murders of up to 1.5million @entity4 in 1915 as ' the first genocide of the 20th century '			1
the pontiff made the comments at a 100th anniversary @entity8 on sunday , prompting @entity2 to summon the @entity10 's ambassador in @entity11 in protest			0
@entity2 told the @entity10 ambassador it was ' deeply sorry and disappointed ' in @entity0 , adding that his comments had caused a ' problem of trust '			1
today was the first time a pope has publicly used ' genocide ' to describe the massacre , although it is a term used by many @entity36 and @entity37 governments			0
in 2001 , pope @entity40 and @entity39 supreme patriarch @entity38 called it ' the first genocide of the 20th century ' in a joint written statement			1
@entity0 , who has disregarded many aspects of protocol since becoming pope two years ago , uttered the phrase during a private meeting at the @entity10 with an @entity4 delegation in 2013 , prompting a strong protest from @entity11			1
as the archbishop of @entity53 before becoming the leader of the world 's 1.2 billion @entity55 , @entity51 had already publicly characterised the mass killings as genocide			0
pope @entity0 listens as the patriarch of the @entity61 @entity60 speaks during a mass on the 100th anniversary of the @entity4 mass killings in @entity65 at the @entity10 mass : pope @entity0 greets the head of @entity4 's @entity68 , during an @entity4 - @entity8 on the occasion of the commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the @entity72 in memoriam : prelates take pictures as @entity0 during the mass in the @entity10 today in november , the @entity78 - born pontiff made an official visit to @entity2 as part of his efforts to solidify relations with moderate @entity84 states			1
this april marks the 100th anniversary of the massacre of an estimated 1.5 million @entity4 by @entity21			2
the anniversary of the mass killings in @entity89 will be commemorated by @entity4 on april 24			2
the killings in 1915 are regarded by many historians as the first genocide of the 20th century , and are said to have inspired @entity94 leader @entity93			1
@entity4 say up to 1.5 million of their kin were killed between 1915 and 1917 as the @entity21 was falling apart and have long sought to win international recognition of the massacres as genocide			1
@entity2 rejects the claims , arguing that 300,000 to 500,000 @entity4 and as many @entity2 died in civil strife when @entity4 rose up against their @entity21 rulers and sided with invading @entity103 troops			1
several @entity36 countries recognize the massacres as such , though @entity106 and the @entity107 , for example , have avoided using the term officially given the importance they place on @entity2 as an ally			0
last year , @entity2 president @entity112 issued a message of condolences to descendants of @entity4 killed and said @entity2 was ready to confront the history of the killings			1
more recently , @entity112 has accused @entity4 of not looking for the truth but seeking to score points against @entity2 , saying numerous calls from @entity2 for joint research to document precisely what happened had gone unanswered			2
at the start of the @entity4 rite @entity8 in @entity65 , @entity0 described the ' senseless slaughter ' of 100 years ago as ' the first genocide of the 20th century ' , which was followed by ' @entity126 '			1
' it is necessary , and indeed a duty , to honour their memory , for whenever memory fades , it means that evil allows wounds to fester			0
concealing or denying evil is like allowing a wound to keep bleeding without bandaging it ! ' he said			0
@entity0 's comments were also published by @entity4 president @entity141 's office on sunday			2
' we are deeply grateful to @entity143 for the idea of this unprecedented liturgy ... which symbolizes our solidarity with the people of the @entity149 world , ' @entity141 said in a speech at a @entity10 dinner on saturday evening			0
after @entity0 's remarks on sunday , @entity2 swiftly summoned the @entity10 's ambassador in @entity11 to protest and seek an explanation			0
' the pope 's statement which is far from historic and legal truths is unacceptable			0
religious positions are not places where unfounded claims are made and hatred is stirred , ' foreign minister @entity158 tweeted			0
the @entity163 in @entity11 later issued a statement conveying its ' great disappointment and sadness			0
' it said the pope 's words signaled a loss in trust , contradicted the pope 's message of peace and was discriminatory because @entity0 only mentioned the pain of @entity149 , not @entity84 or other religious groups			2
@entity0 also urged reconciliation between @entity2 and @entity4 , and between @entity4 and @entity178 over the disputed @entity180 mountain region of @entity181			1
the appeal came in a letter handed out during a meeting after the @entity8 to @entity141 and the three most important @entity4 church patriarchs present .			0
