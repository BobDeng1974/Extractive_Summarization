plaster casts have changed relatively little in the 300 years they have existed , but the treatment has just been given a 21st century makeover			0
a new 3d - printed cast has recently won an award for its innovative design because , quite apart from its slick look , it uses ultrasound to speed up healing too			1
the @entity9 is the product of four months of research by a @entity13 design student			1
droid medicine : the award - winning @entity16 medical cast pulses low frequency ultrasound directly on the arm ‘ conventional medical casts sacrifice ventilation for structural integrity , ’ @entity20 says in his paper proposing the design			1
‘ as a result they are itchy , they smell very bad and due to plaster ’s material properties they are bulky , heavy and they limit patient ’s exposure to water			0
’ @entity13 student @entity36 ( pictured ) won the 2014 @entity38 for his concept the @entity16 medical cast , he claims , tackles the problem by 3d - printing the cast to fit the shape of the patient ’s arm , and also providing ventilation holes			1
to perfectly fit the cast to a patient ’s arm , the injured area is scanned with a 3d body scanner			2
this data is then transferred to modelling software , which determines the overall size and geometry of the finished cast			0
once printed , a locking mechanism and algorithmically generated ventilation holes area added			1
according to @entity20 , from @entity59 , @entity13 , a low intensity pulsed ultrasound ( @entity62 ) bone stimulator is then placed directly on a patient 's skin when the design has been printed			1
the medical cast is combined with the @entity62 stimulator system to speed up the healing @entity70 company says that spending just 20 minutes a day hooked to the system , which plugs directly into the cast , reduces healing time by up to 38 per cent and increases the healing rate up to 80 per cent over traditional casts			2
later on additional locking mechanisms and algorithmically generated ventilation holes are added to the final data along with @entity62 probe adapters its maker claims that spending just 20 minutes a day hooked up to the mains could increase the healing rate for fractures and breaks by up to 80 per cent the ventilation holes also enable the @entity62 bone stimulator probes to be placed directly over the injured area			1
there is a thin layer of rubber fixed to the edges of the @entity62 adapters , which helps these pieces to fit on the ventilation holes of the medical cast			1
‘ the most difficult part was to come up with a fully functioning locking mechanism which is strong enough to protect the limb , ’ @entity20 concludes			0
it also had to be ‘ practical enough to put it on the fragile injured area and simple enough so that it does n’t disturb the general form of the medical cast			0
’ the product is still in its design phase so the date it will be on the market is not known but , when it does , it could revolutionise cast technology			2
as reported by @entity116 last year , @entity113 , a media design graduate from @entity115 , has worked with the orthopaedic department of the @entity118 to create a similar next generation cast			0
named the @entity121 , it uses 3d scans and x-rays to provide tailor - made support for an injury and once printed it easily clips on to the affected area			2
it is lightweight , ventilated , washable and thin enough to fit under a sleeve			0
the concept uses x-ray and @entity133 scans of a patient to generate a 3d model in relation to the point of fracture , which is then printed and worn .			0

a @entity13 design student has *unveiled* his revolutionary cast for patients
the 3d - printed cast enables injuries to be treated *faster* and more easily
ventilation holes on the @entity9 *prevent* itches and smells
an ultrasound system can also be be attached to the ventilation holes
when attached to the cast this system further speeds the healing process
