by @entity1 reporter published : 12:28 est , 30 june 2012 updated : 05:57 est , 1 july 2012 the start of the great @entity4 summer might typically see people seek shelter from the sunshine			1
but in one of the wettest , coldest and dullest june 's since records began , taking refuge under a sink from yet another downpour was all part of the start of summer for youngsters attending a @entity17 show			1
and elsewhere , the story was n't much different as storms and hailstones as big as golf balls were all scenes which unfolded due to june 's unseasonable weather			1
' @entity25 , can we go home now ? two youngsters shelter from the torrential downpour at the fair in @entity17 visitors to the @entity31 in @entity32 today had to put up with the unseasonal conditions for june average rainfall over @entity35 and @entity36 , including an estimated figure for today , was 157mm - more than twice the average for the period between 1981 - 2010			1
the wettest june recorded previously was in 2007 when there were heavy floods in the north of the country			1
previously , the second wettest june was in 1912 and the @entity44 said that we have already far surpassed the amount of rain that fell in that month			1
the equivalent figures for @entity49 were 104mm and 171 % of the normal amount of rainfall , and for 145mm , which is twice the typical amount expected in @entity53			0
as well as being amongst the wettest junes on record , the month has also been one of the dullest intense downpours have plagued much of the country as the unseasonal conditions have taken hold it has already been confirmed that this month has been the wettest june in @entity36			1
june 2012 was also the dullest since 1909 and the coldest since 1991			1
average sunshine over @entity35 and @entity36 , including an estimated figure for june 30 , was 123 hours , which is a mere 64 % of the 1981 - 2010 average			2
. in @entity49 , there were 123 hours of sunshine and in @entity53 , an unseasonable 136 hours			0
and it does n't look like the start of july will be much better as @entity68 , of forecasters @entity70 , said : ‘ next week looks unsettled again with lots of wet weather around			1
’ the torrential rain and fierce storms have been put down to a weather phenomenon known as the @entity77 plume , forecasters said			2
the pattern occurs when warm , moist air sweeping up from the south is lifted by a cold weather front from the west bringing prolonged and exceptionally intense downpours			2
riding the wave : a wave of flood water hits a police @entity87 as it struggles to drive through flooded streets in @entity90 hail : the ground looks like it is covered in snow in @entity93 , @entity94 , following a storm earlier this week @entity96 , senior forecaster at @entity70 , said : ' it is a pattern that when it sets up in the correct fashion will produce spectacular thunder storms			2
' the @entity77 plume was behind three rare ' super cell ' thunderstorms that swept across the @entity104 this week bringing hailstones the size of golf balls in some areas			0
the @entity109 due to take place in @entity112 's @entity111 over the weekend that was expected to attract more than 100,000 revelers has been cancelled due to the heavy rain			0
elsewhere , swathes of the @entity104 were hit by intense downpours , with some parts receiving almost an inch of rain in just an hour - a third of the average rainfall for the whole month of june			2
a flash thunderstorm in @entity123 this week turned the roads into rivers many homeowners were forced to remove ruined furniture from their homes after flash floods water , water everywhere : june 2012 looks set to be one of the wettest on record the dreadful weather this month also caused transport headaches for thousands			1
a landslide caused by a torrential downpour led to a freight train derailing , blocking the @entity140 line			0
the 24 - wagon train came off the tracks between @entity143 and @entity144 on the 28th june as a result of a huge influx of rain			0
the final figures for this month 's rainfall will not be released until june 2nd by the @entity44 , but it is anticipated that rainfall will be amongst the highest ever for the month			1
186.3mm of rain fell in the country beating the previous highest amount of rainfall for june - 183.1mm - which had been set in 1998			0
a store owner in @entity157 tries to put his livelihood back together after heavy rainfall caused severe flooding a landslip on the @entity162 in @entity163 , near @entity164 , caused chaos for travelers many rail passengers had their journeys disrupted due to adverse weather conditions more typical of other times in the year as well as having to put up with a higher than average amount of rain , people looking forward to enjoying the sun have also been disappointed this month			2
temperatures have been below average , with a mean temperature of 11.9c - 0.7c below average for june , and the @entity178 of @entity179 ( @entity180 ) was 0.9 degree @entity181 below the average for 1981 - 2010 - the lowest in june since 1991			0
as well as the @entity183 , one of the main factors behind the dull weather so far this month has been the position of the jet stream , which has been much further south than usual			2
this has led to low pressure systems ending up close to the @entity4 for almost the whole month			0
despite the mostly dreadful weather this month , however , june appeared to end with a slight and brief spell of more typical conditions for the month			1
yesterday saw a patch of hot and humid air pushed up into the country from @entity77 , which led to warm and muggy conditions			0
the temperature in @entity199 in central @entity200 even reached 28.4c			0
typically , the sunshine did not last in many parts of the country , though , and there were thunderstorms across the @entity4			0
@entity53 and @entity49 were worst affected by the sudden downpours and a staggering 1,000 lightning strokes hit the @entity4 during a five minute period yesterday .			0

the @entity209 confirmed that the period from april to june had been the wettest since records began
wettest ever june was in 2007 according to @entity44 but final count for this month has yet to be *announced*
