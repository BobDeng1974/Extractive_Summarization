but @entity0 has warned warm spell unlikely to continue into next week by @entity2 last updated at 7:16 pm on 19th november 2011 while leaves on the line is often used as an excuse for train delays , the unseasonably warm weather is now being blamed by operators who are cancelling services due to the wrong type of soil			1
@entity13 has cancelled @entity15 services between @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 because dry soil has caused the rails to shift			1
passengers expecting to use the services tomorrow and next sunday will be forced to use replacement buses while repairs to the tracks are carried out			2
cancelled : some @entity15 services have had to be cancelled as dry soil has caused the rails to shift a spokesman for @entity13 said : ' the closures are necessary because the ground on this stretch of track is drying out owing to a lack of rainfall in the area			1
' as a result of the dry weather , ground movement has caused the tracks to become out of direct alignment with the overhead lines used to power trains			1
' services have been running at a reduced speed to minimise the chances of any disruption and remedial work has been carried out			0
' it is absolutely essential that we carry out this work to keep the railway running efficiently and safely			0
' the mild temperatures are set to continue throughout the weekend and will mean @entity53 is hotter than @entity54			1
it will be unseasonably mild , according to predictions , with temperatures averaging 14c ( 57f ) across @entity53 , as the unexpectedly warm november weather continues			1
last thursday , temperatures in @entity60 , @entity61 , reached 16.2c ( 61f )			2
and today , they are expected to reach 15.5c ( 60f ) there – hotter than @entity64 , @entity54 , where the temperature is 13c ( 55f )			1
it is also set to be warmer than @entity67 , @entity68 , where it is 13c and match @entity70 , @entity71 , where it is 15c			2
the outlook is not entirely positive , though , as some areas will be cloudy and may see showers , according to forecasts			0
illuminated : the iconic @entity76 stands against a golden backdrop as the sun sets over the northern edge of rural @entity80 so far , temperatures this month have averaged 9.4c ( 49f ) – 3.5c above the november average of 5.9c ( 43f )			2
but it could soon be time to finally dig out those woolly jumpers , as the @entity0 has warned that the warm spell is unlikely to continue much past this weekend			1
@entity86 , a @entity0 forecaster , said : ‘ the first part of the month has been very warm			1
we have been seeing very mild temperatures of around 14 - 15c during the day which will continue into the weekend			1
’ the unseasonably warm weather is down to milder southerly winds blowing across from the @entity93 , according to the forecaster			0
@entity95 : the sun falls across @entity97 as a pelican prepares to fly across the park 's lake in central @entity101 take - off : the pelican sets off on its journey with the rays from the warm sun bouncing off the lake normally , @entity53 would be experiencing cooler westerly winds from across the @entity108			1
‘ the warm weather is also down to an area of high pressure over the @entity53 and that brings in the milder conditions , ’ she added			1
' as we move into next week , we will see temperatures return to normal for november			1
it will be quite cold , especially compared with the warmer weather we ’ve been experiencing			0
’ night - time temperatures this month , averaging @entity119 ( 44f ) over the first 15 days , have also been higher than the average of 4 - 5c ( 39 - 41f )			0
spring - like : a mallard at @entity122 has hatched a clutch of 11 ducklings , about six months later than usual and this november has been one of the driest on record , with 25.6mm of rain falling – 22 per cent of the monthly average of 116mm			0
but miss @entity86 said it would be difficult to predict whether it would be the warmest on record			0
the current record for november was set in 1994 , when temperatures averaged 8.8c ( 48f )			2
tomorrow : dry and cloudy with sunny spells across the bulk of @entity136 , @entity137 and northern @entity138 , although morning mist and fog will be slow to clear			0
elsewhere , mainly cloudy , with occasional rain or showers			0
@entity144 : 14c ( 57f ) low : 9 ( 48ft ) @entity145 : high : 16c ( 61ft ) low : 8c ( 46ft ) monday : rain in many places lingering in the east on @entity150 : 12c ( 54ft ) low : 8c ( 46ft ) @entity145 : high : 12c ( 54ft ) low : 10c ( 50ft ) tuesday : brighter conditions push into the west but wo n't last long resulting in a chilly to start to @entity155 - high : 11c ( 52 ft @entity152 : 10c ( 50 ft ) @entity156 : 13 ( 55ft ) low : 11c ( 52ft ) while the warm weather might seem like a blessing to most of us , it has left wildlife confused			2
swallows , whose arrival usually marks the beginning of summer , have been spotted on @entity167			0
frogs have begun mating and in @entity101 , a duck has hatched a clutch of 11 ducklings six months earlier than usual			0
the ducklings , which would normally be born between april and june , could be seen paddling on the entrance lake at the @entity122 , in @entity175 , yesterday			0
@entity176 , of the @entity177 , said : ‘ fortunately , the mild weather means there is still a fair bit of greenery out there for the ducklings to nibble on			0
’ the balmy conditions that @entity53 has been experiencing look set to continue into next week			1
it has also left forecasters admitting that - despite being so close to @entity187 - there is still no sign of winter			0
forecaster @entity190 of @entity191 added : ' the mild southerly winds causing this unusually - mild autumn are proving incredibly stable and difficult to shift , with no imminent arrival of winter ahead			2

dry soil has caused train tracks to shift resulting in cancellations
