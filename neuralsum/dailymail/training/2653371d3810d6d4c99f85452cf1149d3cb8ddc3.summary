with the current president a product of an interracial marriage , it 's easy to forget how recently miscegenation was taboo in the @entity5 and how mixed - race couples still face hardships today			2
photographer @entity8 illustrates the modern challenges facing these couples in new book ' @entity13 '			1

" frames " photographer @entity22 first started intermarried in 2009 , inspired by family photos she encountered interviewing a former opera singer who had married outside her race at a time when the practice was banned in 20 states ' her late husband @entity30 , was a piano player , and from the many family photos in her apartment , i realized they were intermarried			1

when @entity43 started to take shape , @entity36 asked @entity19 about her marriage to @entity30 in the 1950s , when interracial marriages were banned in more than 40 @entity5 states			1
' in response , she put on her great smile and told me that they always did things their way			2
' unfortunately , @entity36 was never able to sit down with @entity19 for a long interview about her marriage since she passed away soon after			2
thankfully though , @entity36 was able to speak with many more couples , starting by first contacting a parenting group in the @entity59 neighborhood of @entity60			2
many of the couples identified themselves as mixed and allowed @entity42 into their homes to take pictures of their families and the spaces they shared together			2
for some , the act of marrying someone outside of their race or religion meant offending their family			1

' while both families were concerned about the religious background of any possible grandchildren , it was little @entity126 's birth in 2006 that actually brought them together in the end			0

' despite our upbringing across the world , there were a remarkable number of similarities			0
it is pretty scary how similar out parents are and how similar our experiences were growing up , ' @entity164 said			0
overall , @entity36 hopes her latest book will create a ' platform for thinking and talking about issues that are very personal but have cast social and political implications '			1
