by @entity0 published : 06:42 est , 31 may 2012 updated : 08:54 est , 31 may 2012 @entity1 was fighting to keep his job today but it appears he has cycled himself into even more trouble by breaking the law three times and risking £ 3,000 in police fines during one short bike ride			1
in just 13 minutes and two miles of peddling the beleaguered culture secretary was snapped riding through a red traffic light and twice down one - way streets as he wobbled home from work on his bike			1
dressed in jeans and a casual shirt , he was not only flouting the highway code but also acting illegally , with each offence carrying a maximum penalty of £ 1,000			1
and to top it off he was n't wearing a helmet , which is not against the law , but will anger safety campaigners			0
no stopping him : @entity1 simply ignores the red traffic light and rides off on his merry way still going : he does n't stop to look for traffic and just ploughs on across a @entity27 street @entity28 , of the @entity30 ' @entity29 told the mirror : ' all road users should respect the rules - and ministers , especially , should set an example			2
' the exercise fanatic , who is also known to be a keen runner , was sweating for another reason today as he was today grilled at the @entity41 over his handling of @entity44 's £ 8 billion takeover bid of @entity45			1
he is battling to keep his job because he is accused of being ' too cosy ' with the @entity48 empire and urging @entity49 not to block the deal despite needing to be independent			0
no entry : the beleaguered culture secretary next takes his journey the wrong way up a one - way street , which is also illegal and another : he also travels through another no entry sign as he travels back from the office and his law - breaking cycle ride started on sunday at around 7pm just after he left work near @entity60 for his plush @entity62 home in @entity63			1
by 7.10pm he approached a red light and despite a queue of traffic at the t - junction he followed two other cyclists through it			2
two minutes later he flew down a one way street , and then at 7.15pm ignored another stop sign before arriving home and chaining up his bike			0
one witness told the mirror : ' he did n't seem to care about the rules , but it 's not fair on other people			0
he could have caused an accident			0
' nearly there : mr @entity1 arrives at his home after the two - mile journey unaware he has been spotted breaking the law			0

the culture secretary flouted the law three times on his journey back from work on sunday
running a red light and ignoring a one way sign are offences which carry a fine of up to £ 1,000 each
sweating minister also feeling the heat at the @entity41 today
