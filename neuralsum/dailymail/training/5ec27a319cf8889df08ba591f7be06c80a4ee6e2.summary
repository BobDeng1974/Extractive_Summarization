by @entity0 for many children , the new school year means a reinvention of playground style , with cooler schoolbags and brighter pencil cases replacing last year 's tired trends			0
the majority of discarded attire is forgotten about for years to come , as are the once loved fictional figures who were proudly paraded on the front of lunchboxes			2
but one man is pleased to remind the world of times gone by , with an astonishing collection of metal lunchboxes in @entity19 , @entity20			1
@entity43 since 1991 the world 's largest lunchbox museum reminds visitors of the things they loved as children , to the delight of curator , @entity27			1
mr @entity27 , 79 , fell in love with the colourful metal boxes when he saw two at a flea market as a child , after using a brown paper bag to carry his own lunch to school , he told @entity57			1
after purchasing the @entity59 and @entity60 boxes , he went on to amass the shop 's collection over 30 years , before deciding to open the museum in 1991			2
he told @entity64 : ' i 've always had a passion for lunchboxes			0
' around 1989 i took a trip to @entity69 to view the collection of a man who had died ' among his hoard of 80s classics are @entity74 , @entity75 and @entity77 boxes which help remind visitors of things they once loved metal lunchboxes went out of fashion in the 1980s when plastic models became more popular ' his widow was selling the lunchboxes which had attracted collectors from @entity86 and @entity87 and all over the place			1
' mr @entity27 said he knew he did n't stand much of a chance at getting his hands on the boxes with other such experienced enthusiasts there			2
' i knew it would be hard for the widow to be selling them			0
footage courtesy @entity57 ' so i gave her my word that if she sold them to me , i would use them as the foundation for a museum , and dedicate my book to her late husband , ' which is exactly what he did			0
his @entity107 of @entity109 was published in 1992 with a dedication to mr @entity111 on its front pages			0
mr @entity111 's collection of 750 lunchboxes was the beginning of the museum which is now home to more than 2,000 lunch boxes , thermoses , and related memorabilia			2

unsurprisingly , designs were a little simpler back then , with drawings of trains and boy scouts proudly shown where the @entity74 and @entity143 stood later			0
