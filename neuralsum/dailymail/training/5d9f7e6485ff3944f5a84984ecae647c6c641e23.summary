airline food is notoriously bad , with most passengers forcing it down because at 30,000 feet , there are simply no other culinary options			0
so the idea that some would actually want to consume it at ground level - where a huge variety of delicious , fresh , non-mystery meat options are available - is a surprising one			0
nevertheless , @entity14 food delivery website @entity12 has launched @entity15 in collaboration with @entity18 ' caterers , delivering an aeroplane meal once a week to customers			1
airplane food on the ground : a new @entity14 delivery service provides meals from the plane in your home a class above : unlike the unidentifiable dishes in economy though , the meals are the same as those offered to @entity34 passengers but far from the unidentifiable meats , bland sauces and soggy vegetables the average economy flyer is begrudgingly accustomed too , the meals are actually from @entity34			1
just like on the plane , you can choose from the regular or vegetarian option			0
every wednesday , customers will receive delivery of the same meal being served to passengers sitting up front on @entity18 that week			1
familiar : this is the sort of meal the average flyer is usually faced with on flights options : customers are given a choice of regular or vegetarian options the full meal costs € 9.99 ( approximately £ 7.85 ) per week and € 8.99 ( approximately £ 7.05 ) for vegetarian			1
the food arrives cold and needs to be cooked in the oven before consuming			0
it is also suitable for freezing			0
on the menu next week is ' @entity63 @entity62 ' , and ' @entity64 ' for the vegetarian options			0
cutting down on waste : catering company @entity67 reduces waste by using the surplus business class meals not ordered by passengers on board other upcoming dishes include ' @entity73 with @entity74 ' or ' @entity75 with @entity76 ' , and ' @entity77 with @entity78 ' or ' @entity79 with @entity80 '			2
the service is much like any other ready meal delivery , except only one meal per week is currently available			2
the idea also cuts down on food waste for @entity67 , the catering company behind the service , as the surplus meals not ordered by @entity34 passengers are used to fill orders , rather than being thrown out .			1

@entity15 delivers one plane meal per week to customers for £ 7.85
collaboration with @entity18 caterers @entity67
meals match those served each week in @entity34
