exclusive as the decision over the future of the @entity6 edges ever closer , one of @entity3 ’s most famous fans has called for the east @entity8 club to be named as the anchor tenants of the venue			1
@entity12 actor @entity11 has pleaded for ‘ common sense to prevail ’ as the @entity3 wait to find out who will be named as the preferred bidder by the @entity16 ( @entity16 ) on wednesday			1
the @entity18 club are up against @entity20 side @entity19 , a football business college and a group keen to bring @entity23 racing to the @entity24			1
but @entity11 exclusively tells @entity25 there can only be one winner ... i was born in @entity29 and spent my early years living in @entity30 so i grew up in the area where the @entity32 were held			1
i loved living in east @entity8 and we are a special bunch of people where community spirit and passion form a major part of who we are			1
but i ’ve watched how the area has changed over time and know only too well that it has needed rejuvenation for many , many years			1
the fun and games of the @entity32 are over now and we have a golden opportunity to really change the perception of the area and put the pride back in east @entity8			1
decision time : the future of the @entity6 is set to be decided like most other @entity53 , i ’m a lifelong supporter of @entity3 and i feel so passionately about my club and the area i grew up in that wanted to share my thoughts on how i think the @entity6 can be used to help make that change			1
as many people know , the club are currently going through the process of trying to become tenants at the @entity6 , a process that could be concluded soon			1
i keep hearing this word ‘ legacy ’ but i think it ’s been overused to the point where people do n’t really know what it means			1
for me , the word legacy is simply about what we are going to leave for our future generations			1
i remember when i was a boy my @entity74 used to take me to the cinema in east @entity8 every wednesday and i used to watch the actors on the big screen and thought ‘ i want to do what that geezer does ’			1
it ’s exactly the same for the kids around us today			1
we need to give them something to aspire to			1
@entity3 ’s vice-chairman @entity85 has said that if the club are chosen , they are determined to create an arena that can be used for athletics , football and the community			2
this means that young kids will be able to follow in my footsteps and see their idols and role models up close every week , while also getting involved in skills coaching that the @entity3 community department provide			2
it ’s the perfect match			2
@entity99 plans : @entity3 's vice-chairman @entity85 ( r ) has said that if the club are chosen , they are determined to create an arena ( below ) that can be used for athletics , football and the community for me and for thousands of other @entity107 , the one consistent focal point of the area is our football team			2
i think the club have something like half a million supporters in @entity8 and @entity113			2
as the population of @entity8 has expanded , people who were born and bred in east @entity8 have slowly started to move out into places like @entity113			2
but the main reason we have for coming back is @entity3 ; it ’s our roots and it ’s about where we are from			2
it ’s in our blood from the day we ’re born			2
so i think the fitting legacy for this area and the rest of the country would be to allow @entity3 to help fulfil the dreams of the people of @entity8 and become tenants of the @entity6			2
yes it would bring a great future for the club , but more importantly it would rejuvenate the area as well			0
the prestige of having a @entity18 club playing in that @entity6 would keep the focus of the world on @entity138 for generations and long after the memories of the summer ’s spectacular sporting moments have faded away			0
legacy : after the success of the @entity145 ( above and below ) , athletics will play an important part in the stadium 's future - but so can @entity3 , argues @entity11 although athletics must have a future at the stadium , a key question for me is ‘ do we want to see the @entity6 used maybe once or twice every six months by just having athletics there ? ’			0
having @entity3 there would bring tens of thousands of people from all over the country to the @entity24 every other week and keep that lively atmosphere we saw during the summer			0
it would also bring new jobs to the area , not just working at the @entity6 , but also the surrounding areas			0
the club alone have promised to create over 700 new positions			0
people will want to bring their businesses back , which will rejuvenate this area			0
if you go around some parts of east @entity8 at the moment all you see are shops that are closed and people having to go somewhere else to find a job			0
i think that @entity3 moving into that stadium would help bring some of that buzz back			0
hammer time : @entity3 want to leave their @entity175 ( below ) home to start a new , exciting era in @entity138 on the football side , it would be good for the club and it would attract great players who would want to play in a great stadium			0
it is the way forward for @entity3			0
the way the club has been run over the past two years by the people who run it proves they are more than capable of taking @entity3 into that @entity6 and turning them into a very successful club both on and off the field			0
they also genuinely care about @entity8			0
we are not @entity193 or @entity194 but we are a big club with a proud history			0
we won the @entity196 by the way			0
we are a famous name , a name that has n’t been realised to its full potential yet , but i think at last we are in good hands to realise that potential			0
being offered the chance to play in the @entity6 would be the icing on the cake			0
it 's time for common sense to prevail			1
' common sense must prevail ' : the @entity209 and @entity210 ( below ) star says @entity3 are the only option			1
