but she and her husband @entity9 , 56 , appeared in @entity10 ’ @entity11 charged with four counts of causing unnecessary suffering to their horses and two charges of failing to ensure the animals ’ welfare			1
neglect : @entity5 , 61 , has been banned from keeping horses after being found guilty of causing unnecessary suffering to her animals @entity22 inspector @entity21 visited the couple ’s stables in @entity25 , near @entity10 , on june 14 2011 after the @entity26 raised the alarm			1
he said : ' when i turned up on the day i thought offences had been committed as did the vet and our independent prosecutions department			0
' the investigation found that two of the horses at the stables were suffering from the foot disease laminitis , while another had severe dental problems			2
suffering : a grey stallion had been so neglected it was put down immediately squalid : the accumulation of litter meant the horses ' heads were nearly touching the ceilings of their stables an accumulation of dirty litter meant the horses ’ heads were almost touching the roof of their stables			0
a grey stallion , called ‘ @entity54 ’ , had to be put down at the scene			0
two other horses were signed over to the @entity22 - an @entity58 cross mare and a grey mare - and both were put down on veterinary advice			2
a fourth horse , an @entity58 cross stallion named @entity64 , has n’t been signed over by the couple but is currently in @entity22 care			1
it has had to undergo six months of treatment on its hooves			0
the @entity70 pleaded not guilty to causing unnecessary suffering to an adult female @entity58 cross by failing to seek professional veterinary attention for chronic laminitis , and to causing unnecessary suffering to a grey stallion by failing to seek professional veterinary attention for chronic laminitis			1
prolific : @entity5 has written a number of books on horses			2
her latest , ' understanding the @entity7 ' was written during the period the @entity22 say the neglect took place - between 14 may and 14 june 2011			0
they were also charged with causing unnecessary suffering to an @entity58 cross stallion by failing to seek professional veterinary attention for overgrown hooves , and with causing unnecessary suffering to a grey mare by failing to seek appropriate veterinary care to address dental problems			1
the couple also pleaded not guilty to failing to meet the needs of the four horses by not ensuring their need for a suitable environment and failing to meet their needs by failing to protect them from pain , suffering , injury and disease			2
the @entity70 , of @entity102 , @entity103 , were found guilty of all the charges which took place between 14 may and 14 june 2011 following a four day trial			2
survivor : an @entity58 cross stallion named @entity108 ( pictured ) , had to have treatment for overgrown hooves their solicitor , @entity110 , argued that any ban on keeping animals should relate only to horses because there was no evidence that the couple had ever neglected their other animals			0
she said : ' these people are in their late fifties , early sixties and there is no suggestion that they have neglected any other animals			0
' they have dogs and cats at home , i ask that they can keep the dogs and cats bearing in mind it is the first offence and bearing in mind the difficulties they have had			0
' put to sleep : a grey mare called @entity140 ( pictured ) was put down because of dental problems the court had previously heard that mr @entity70 suffers from bipolar and post-traumatic stress disorder and that the pair were suffering from flu when the bedding became too difficult to clear out by hand			0
presiding magistrate @entity149 banned them from keeping horses indefinitely and imposed a deprivation order in favour of the @entity22 , meaning that a fourth horse will stay under the charity ’s care			1
the couple were also ordered to pay £ 250 each towards court costs			1
pain : @entity160 ( pictured ) also had to be put down , so advanced was its chronic foot disease speaking after the sentence , @entity22 inspector @entity163 said : ' we are really pleased with the sentencing , we strove for a ban , that is what we took them to court for and that is what we have got			0
' the fact that it is an indefinite ban is really good news to protect animals from suffering in their hands in future			0
' @entity22 inspector @entity21 said : ' these are people who are supposed to know how to care for horses , so it is even more unacceptable that they left these animals in such poor conditions			1
' by banning the defendants from keeping horses the court has recognised how important it is that no other animals are made to endure the same fate			1
