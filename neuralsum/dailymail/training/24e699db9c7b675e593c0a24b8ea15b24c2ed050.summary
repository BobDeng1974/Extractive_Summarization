the number of medics seeking help to deal with unwanted advances has risen by a third ( file picture ) medics are even finding themselves in danger of being struck off after being falsely accused of having a relationship with a patient who is infatuated with them			0
dr @entity29 , of the @entity6 , which provides legal advice and insurance to doctors , said : ‘ the trend towards patients making unsolicited advances to their doctor is not a new one			1

’ in one case , a male gp began to receive letters and gifts from a patient with mental health problems			0
the woman was told the contact was inappropriate but continued to send letters and also sent repeated friend requests on @entity3			1
although some flirtations are said to quickly fizzle out , in the worst cases police are being called and injunctions taken out ( file picture ) after her care was transferred to another doctor in the practice , she told the @entity73 she had had a sexual relationship with the first gp			1
the doctor denied this and was cleared of any wrongdoing – but only after a six - month investigation			0
in another example , a female gp was asked out for a drink by a male patient as she left her surgery			0
when she declined , the patient pestered her via @entity3 , and sent her lilies , after reading on the site that they were her favourite flower			1
on the @entity6 ’s advice , the doctor changed the security and privacy settings on the site , so that only a few chosen friends could see the information she had posted			1
