by @entity0 published : 07:13 est , 23 october 2012 updated : 20:09 est , 23 october 2012 the two muddy patches at the side of the street were crying out for a little love and attention			0
so when gp @entity7 spent her own time and money making them look attractive by planting some shrubs , neighbours were delighted			1
but days later a letter arrived from the council saying the work had been done without its approval			0
' licence to cultivate ' : angry gp @entity7 and local councillor @entity17 by the spruced up muddy verge in @entity19 with the small number of plants she put in , in front of them dr @entity7 , 47 , was told she had to apply for a ‘ licence to cultivate ’ – a process that involved submitting a detailed plan and paying an £ 84 fee			1
she reluctantly agreed to the demand but yesterday criticised the ‘ tick - box culture ’ that threatens to stifle public - spirited behaviour			0
dr @entity7 , who was yesterday resigned to paying the fee , has demanded a rethink on the 30 - year - old rules she claims leave no room for common sense			1
' it does n’t make sense to be discouraging the local community from beautifying the neighbourhood , ' she said			2
dr @entity7 planted the greenery on council - owned land at the end of her driveway in @entity19 in the last week of september			1
the land on each side had been churned up into a muddy mess by residents and visitors to a nearby gp surgery as they parked their cars			2
@entity53 neighbours commented on how lovely it looked after dr @entity7 ’s efforts			1
dismal : the @entity16 put in a measly number of shrubs into this bed , and one across the road from it , to stop illegal parkers and make her area look nicer , but @entity65 say she has broken the law and must pay £ 84 to them @entity69 : a map drawn by @entity7 to show where she had planted a peppering of pretty plants but her local authority have hit the roof but on october 10 , a letter from @entity65 arrived saying she had breached the @entity77 , under which local authorities control planting on public land			1
in the plan she had to submit , dr @entity7 explained how the planting ‘ replaced a weedy , bald area of ground ’			1
letters outlined what greenery had been planted and where – including lily of the valley bush and hardy geranium			0
the council ’s highways department has now approved her application			0
local councillor @entity17 said no one who tries to improve their neighbourhood should be treated like a criminal			0
he added : ‘ this action is both unnecessary and petty compared to the damage that is done all year round by parking on verges			0
’ the council insisted the application for a licence was standard practice			2
a spokesman said : ‘ the fee covers the cost of inspecting the site and agreeing a planting scheme			0

dr @entity7 put in shrubs to put off illegal parkers in @entity19
residents *welcomed* the move but council *accused* her of breaking law
they demanded she pay for a ' licence to cultivate ' tiny *scraps* of land
' so many *people* litter the streets and are n’t brought up for it , but if you are beautifying the streets you have to pay extra money , ' @entity16 said
