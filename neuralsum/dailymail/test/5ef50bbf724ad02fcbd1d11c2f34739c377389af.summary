when most think of @entity0 , its ubiquitous @entity1 spring to mind			1
but in a bid to shed its image as the home of the mundane run - around , the company has launched its very own supercar			0
with the first models already shipped to @entity10 , the @entity11 , will be unrolled across @entity12 next year			1
while @entity0 has refused to officially confirm its price , bosses have indicated it will run alongside the £ 260,000 @entity15			2
to herald its launch , the company 's design team have created a stunning light sculpture which showcases how they came about creating the prototype			2
@entity0 showcased its £ 260,000 gt in a stunning light installation in the heart of @entity24 as the first models are shipped to @entity10 the light sculpture was unveiled in the @entity25 on tuesday as part of @entity27 planted in @entity24 's @entity25 , it walked through the steps of rendering to give insight into the car 's conception			1
in the heart of one of the world 's most design - savvy cities , many were surprised to learn the piece had been produced by car designers and engineers , said bosses			1
' ( having an artwork ) is something new for us but really it combined everything that we do everyday , ' said @entity49 , @entity0 's vice president of design			1
' the model making , the technology - all of that was done in house so it 's just taking what we do and presenting it in a different way			0
' ' we , generally , are a car company that talks to car guys but we wanted to reach a wider audience			0
' we 've had people approaching the installation and asking " this is @entity0 ? ! " which is just great			2
' people were shocked that we were doing this and that 's what we wanted to hear			0
' alongside the modern artwork , @entity0 has released some of the first impressions of what the @entity71 will look like			0
the artwork was composed by @entity0 designers who worked on the concept for the £ 260,000 @entity11 the interactive installation was placed in @entity24 's @entity25 where it remained throughout design week with its exterior a combination of aluminium and carbon - fibre , the compact two - seater has all the hallmarks of its ultra-sleek competitors			1
and earmarked at around the same price as the @entity15 , the @entity11 is a far cry from the much - loved models which keeps the company afloat			2
but despite a drive towards luxury , bosses insist the company is not trying to breakaway from its most reliable consumer			0
' as long as i 'm around , the mum on the school run will remain important - but design is important for her too , ' added mr @entity49			0
speaking at @entity24 's @entity97 - an annual showcase of the world 's leading furniture and light designers - he continued : ' generally we are a car company that talks to car guys but we want to reach a wider audience			1
' design has always been important but we 're finding you need to expand your audience			0
' the model was showcased for the first time at the @entity111 in @entity112 earlier this year ( above ) the car has up - swinging doors and 600 horsepower			1
it was unveiled in january in @entity112 to a rapturous reception the first images of the interior of the @entity11 have been revealed after 100 of the supercars were shipped to @entity10 while the vehicle wo n't reach @entity12 markets until next year , bosses say they have been ' pleased ' with the reaction the car while the gt is priced out of most 's grasp , another of its most advanced vehicles could be brought to the masses , he added			1
@entity0 's version of a driverless car is in the final stages of production with just safety legislation and measure standing between it and the open road			1
' we have autonomous cars that we 've been working on for the past 20 years in @entity112			0
a lot of the technology is there for about 90 per cent of driving , ' added mr @entity49			0
' what we 're working on now is that extra 10 per cent which will take into account whether there are road works or if there 's been an accident ( and it 's not registered )			2
