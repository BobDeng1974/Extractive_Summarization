@entity1 fashion chain @entity0 has been left red - faced after it forgot to airbrush a naked bather from a promotional photograph for its children 's clothes			1
the image , which appeared for several hours on its website today , showed a group of four children running on the sand			2
but , in the background , a naked man can clearly be seen wading behind them up the sea - shore			0
one tweeter labelled it a ' @entity25 ' while another highlighted the ' @entity27 ! '			0
@entity0 immediately apologised for the mistake , but its website has now come under intense scrutiny from users who also discovered a spelling mistake on one of its t - shirts			1
instead of having ' @entity35 ' written on the garment , it actually says ' @entity37 '			0
faux pas : one of @entity0 's t - shirts has @entity40 rather than @entity35 printed on it the bather 's identity has not yet been revealed , but he has already sprung to fame across the web with a series of mocking images being produced			1
some keen photoshoppers have cut and paste famous people into the original image , which has seen president @entity50 and his wife @entity51 , and even late @entity53 leader @entity52 , taking his place			0
others have placed a cut - out of the naked man in other situations , including a music festival and in someone 's house .			2

photograph appeared on @entity0 's website for several hours
*internet* users also spot spelling mistake on one of firm 's t - shirt
