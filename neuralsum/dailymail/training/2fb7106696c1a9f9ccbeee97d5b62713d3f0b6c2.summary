disturbance : rioting prisoners barricaded themselves in a wing at @entity13 for a staggering nine hours , it has been revealed			1
around 20 inmates damaged cells and threatened prison guards during the protest scene : the riot took place between 5pm yesterday and 2am today at the jail ( pictured ) in @entity14 however , no staff were injured during the riot - with only one prisoner being treated for minor injuries			1
earlier reports had claimed that up to 40 inmates had taken two guards hostage in d wing , before demanding @entity39 's meals were brought to their cells			1
at the time , one prisoner , who did not wish to be named , revealed : ' there are 40 people who have barricaded themselves in with pool tables			0
' they ’re making silly demands like wanting @entity39 's brought to their cells			0
' first class ' : justice secretary @entity48 recently praised the facilities at @entity13 ' they ’ve taken two prison staff hostage and there are loads of police here trying to get it under control , but they have n’t			1
' however , @entity8 and the @entity10 have since dismissed the claims as ' completely untrue '			1
a joint statement read : ' the disruption , which was confined to one wing of the category c prison for male prisoners , began just after 5pm on sunday as prisoners were out of their cells on association , and involved around 15 - 20 prisoners , who threatened officers and caused damage to cells and prison property			1
' a number of prisoners returned to their cells voluntarily			0
the @entity10 was informed immediately , and standard procedures were initiated to deal with the incident , with rapid response teams deployed			1
staffordshire police were also informed			0
' owing to damage caused to cells , a number of prisoners were moved to other wings and to other prisons in the area			0
' the incident was brought under control just after 2am without injury to any prison officers , although one prisoner has been treated for minor injuries			2
' reports of prison staff being taken hostage are completely untrue			2
the safety of our personnel and those prisoners in our care is our top priority , and we are grateful to our colleagues who were able to help us bring the incident to a close safely , and effectively			0
' established incident procedures were followed correctly and worked as they were meant to			0
' untrue ' : earlier reports claimed that inmates had taken two guards hostage , before demanding @entity39 's meals were brought to their cells			1
however , @entity8 and the @entity10 have since dismissed the claims as false ' as an investigation has now commenced into the reasons for this disruption , as well as a criminal investigation , it would be inappropriate to comment further at this time			1
' during the riot , prisoners are believed to have used pool cues to overpower guards			0
standard procedures were initiated to deal with the incident - with rapid response teams and officers from @entity76 deployed to the prison			2
@entity13 - the largest prison in @entity123 and @entity124 - opened in april 2012 as a training prison next to the existing @entity126 and @entity126 near @entity14			2
shock : tonight former home secretary @entity128 ( pictured ) called mr @entity48 's comments about @entity13 ' astonishing ' it houses more than 1,600 category c prisoners and was the the scene of a number of rooftop protests last year			1
the disturbance comes weeks after justice secretary @entity48 defended @entity13 as a ‘ first class facility ’ despite a string of problems , including a damning report from @entity140 of prisons			1
the document , published in october , had reported inexperienced staff and high levels of violence and self - harm at the jail - with chief inspector of prisons @entity150 warning there were ' real risks if matters were allowed to drift '			0
inspectors also revealed that hard drugs were ' easily available ' inside the prison , that inmates brewed their own alcohol in their cells and that hardcore pornography was allowed to be displayed on prison walls			0
at the time @entity8 said improvements were being made but admitted launching the prison was a ' complex and challenging operation '			0
@entity8 - well - known for its botched handling of its @entity167 security contract - has been under review by the government following revelations it overcharged for criminal - tagging contracts			0
the government has since announced that electronic monitoring will handed to another firm on an interim basis at the end of the financial year			0
tonight former home secretary @entity128 said the @entity178 is likely to demand an investigation and called mr @entity48 ’s comments about @entity13 ‘ astonishing ’			1
he told the @entity181 : ‘ i know the @entity178 will want to investigate what has happened , not least because @entity8 have been banned from taking on other prison service contracts that have recently been put out to tender			2
‘ it ’s astonishing that @entity48 should have made his comments less than eight weeks ago			2
i think he will be regretting having been so effusive			0
’ the @entity187 mp , who served as home secretary under @entity189 ’s @entity169 , added : ‘ i think that all the signals about @entity13 have been there to provide sufficient warning that contrary to what the justice secretary believed , management did n’t have a grip on the situation			2
‘ sometimes there are unforeseen eruptions in prisons , often due to overcrowding , but that is quite clearly not the case at @entity13			0
‘ therefore , there are some very important questions to be asked as to who has taken their eye off the ball and who should be held to account for what ’s clearly a danger to prison officers and a breakdown of discipline in relation to those in prison			0
