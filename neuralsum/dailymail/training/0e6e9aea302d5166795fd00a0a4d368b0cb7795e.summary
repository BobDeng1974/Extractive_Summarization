actress @entity0 is currently in @entity1 performing in new @entity4 show @entity2 she forgot her lines — at least five times — and managed to fluff her only major speech of the play			1
the audience laughed but it was at her , sadly , not with her			2
as an ambitious @entity12 secretary called @entity13 in a new @entity4 production of @entity15 ’s @entity2 , @entity0 spends a lot of the play staring into a book she hopes to turn into a film			1
when the audience is left wondering whether the tome was just a prop or actually contained her lines , it ’s a fairly desperate state of affairs			2
as the cast and crew of the @entity29 production absorbed the audience feedback yesterday , you have to ask whether this was all part of the script			1
cynics have always wondered why the play ’s producers and director offered the only female part — in a cast of just three people — to an actress so mired in notoriety and incompetence that her ‘ performances ’ nowadays tend to come from @entity44 police stations , courtrooms and rehabilitation clinics			1
was it a brave attempt to give a second chance — or a third or fourth — to a 28 - year - old @entity12 actress who once showed great promise ? or was it the most cynical exercise yet in hanging a production on a star name , encouraging punters to come and experience whatever the theatrical equivalent is of ‘ car crash tv ’ ? to be fair , it was n’t complete carnage — most agree she improved after a nervous and shaky start — and @entity0 had prepared everyone not to expect her to be perfect			1
she admitted recently she was having trouble learning her lines after so long out of acting and that , apart from a childhood @entity67 , she ’d never been on stage			2
hardcore ‘ lilo ’ fans in the audience were predictably enthralled by her performance although for others , initial amusement at the slip - ups soon turned to annoyance			1
many made their views clear on @entity80 , congratulating the unseen woman prompter who was feeding @entity0 her lines or noting how the actress laughed every time she got something wrong			1
a critic from the online newspaper @entity87 reported how , halfway through the second act , ‘ the audience was openly laughing at @entity0 ’s struggle to grasp @entity15 ’s sharp , trademark dialogue ’			2
when one of her fellow cast members told her ‘ you have done a fantastic job ! ’ , many onlookers could n’t help but titter			2
the same happened when — in a moment of supposedly tragic introspection — @entity0 ’s character admitted : ‘ i know what it is to be bad , i ’ve been bad			2
but @entity0 insists she wants to be good now			2
in interviews she has confided how she sees moving to @entity1 for the play as a new phase in her life — adding that it could become a permanent move away from the temptations she has succumbed to in @entity110 and @entity111 , and from the constant public scrutiny she has endured			1
she says she wants people to ‘ focus on the fact that i ’m in this industry because i ’m an actress and artist , and not just someone you take photos of ’			1
she is regularly being photographed emerging from @entity1 ’s hottest restaurants and nightclubs in shimmering party dresses when she might have been tucked up in bed with a cocoa learning her lines			1
@entity0 has reportedly racked up as much as £ 300,000 , according to one source , on clothes , hotels and bar bills since she came to @entity1 in july to start rehearsals for the play			1
she ’s understood to be living in a private flat in @entity144 after initially staying at various expensive hotels , and has been a regular late - night fixture at the trendy celebrity haunt @entity148			1
@entity0 ’s image certainly was n’t helped either after a @entity151 magazine in march published a long list of lovers that the actress had written down , supposedly to impress friends during a boozy night out			1
among the 36 names were actors @entity158 , @entity160 , @entity161 , @entity162 and @entity163			0
@entity0 claimed she had compiled them as part of her therapy at the @entity168 addiction clinic			0
@entity0 arriving at the @entity29 in central @entity1 for her first performance of @entity2 we have n’t heard much about her on the men front during her @entity1 soujourn — or on women for that matter , as @entity0 reportedly went through a lesbian spell in @entity110 with @entity177 dj @entity176			1
but she insists that ’s because she ’s so intent on reviving her acting career			1
‘ being here in @entity1 is all about me this time , ’ the red - headed actress said earlier this month			1
‘ yeah , @entity183 guys are cute , but it ’s not about the boys			0
it ’s about getting away from @entity111 and @entity110 and starting afresh , which is all very exciting for me			0
i love @entity1 and lived here for eight months once before , so it feels like home			1
’ the transatlantic move has certainly meant a break — so far — from the endless headlines about her arrests for drunk - driving , shoplifting and assaults , coupled with her court appearances , stints in rehab and even spells in prison			1
even by @entity12 ’s high standards , few stars could hold a candle to @entity0 when it came to drugs and drink binges , on - stage tantrums and no end of dysfunctional , diva - like behaviour			1
it was as a sweet - faced , freckled 11 - year - old that she came to prominence , playing a set of twins in a remake of the sister - swap film @entity125			1
roles in teenybopper films such as @entity218 and @entity219 followed			0
she was hailed as the next big thing , and became a role model for countless teenage girls			0
but like many child stars , the pressures of fame began to tell			0
she was soon banned from nightclubs for unpaid bills and wild behaviour			0
a string of convictions followed			0
she was arrested for driving under the influence of drink or drugs , possession of cocaine and for stealing a £ 1,600 necklace from a shop			1
sometimes she turned up to her court hearings — sometimes she did n’t bother			0
a year ago , it emerged she was broke and living in her teenage bedroom at her mother ’s house on @entity243 , @entity111			1
her last major acting venture , a 2013 erotic thriller called @entity246 , attracted such notoriety that her re-emergence in any dramatic endeavour is a small miracle in itself			0
in a @entity254 article headlined ‘ this is what happens when you cast @entity0 in your movie ’ , a reporter who had sat in on the entire film - making process told how @entity0 had brought the low - budget film to its knees with her continual absenteeism , screaming fits and feuding with cast and director			2
@entity0 confirmed the report was ‘ pretty accurate ’			0
critics said the shambles illustrated how a cynical @entity12 was ready to exploit a clearly damaged and troubled young woman willing to do almost anything to revive her career			1
the film ’s tawdry , nudity - filled script was about a group of decadent young people desperate to break into films			2
@entity0 had to act alongside a porn star , playing her rich boyfriend , who invited men and women to his @entity282 mansion to have sex with her			0
the role meant full nudity as well as being filmed in a foursome with three porn actors			0
most actresses would have run screaming from such a prospect , but when the film ’s producer contacted her agent , @entity0 jumped at the chance			0
she made clear she believed the role could have been written for her , even though she was paid only £ 63 a day with a share of any profits			0
‘ we do n’t have to save her , ’ @entity298 , the film ’s director , cynically told members of the crew appalled by the notoriously unreliable @entity0			0
‘ we just have to get her through three weeks in july			0
’ @entity0 starred alongside @entity304 , @entity305 and @entity306 in 2004 's mean girls the @entity254 reported how @entity0 was so poor at turning up to rehearsals that @entity298 pretended to sack her			2
she sat outside his hotel room in tears pleading for a second chance , but her behaviour veered off track again when filming started			0
when the time came to film the ( simulated ) four - way sex scene , she shut herself away in a walk - in closet where she drank with a friend for two - and - a - half hours			2
when she eventually emerged , she refused to take off her dressing gown until the director , in desperation , stripped off himself to persuade her to go naked			0
even the final day ’s filming proved disastrous after @entity0 hit the town with her pop star friend @entity324			0
when she turned up three hours late after having had next to no sleep , @entity0 ’s personal doctor suddenly turned up on set			0
he declared her too ill to continue working and sent her home			0
her porn actor co-star , @entity329 , compared @entity0 ’s behaviour — sometimes refusing to come out of her dressing room — to a ‘ child lashing out ’			0
it was n’t entirely her fault , he added generously , as she had been ruined by a @entity12 system that had left her lost and confused if she was n’t instantly indulged			1
for all her naked , bed - hopping endeavours , the film played in just a handful of cinemas before going straight to video			2
it would be surprising if @entity0 was able to get away with anything like that sort of behaviour in the @entity4 , but then despite her struggling performance on wednesday night , she does appear to have raised her game			1
she has proved she can get to the theatre on time , deliver most of her lines and accept a bouquet at the curtain call without hurling it at anyone			0
by @entity0 ’s standards , that is progress .			0
