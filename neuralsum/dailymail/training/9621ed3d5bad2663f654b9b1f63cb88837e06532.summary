by @entity0 in @entity1 published : 11:10 est , 24 january 2014 updated : 17:41 est , 24 january 2014 former virginia governor @entity3 and his wife @entity4 are facing a slew of federal corruption charges , but as they appeared in court for the first time today , reports emerged that the @entity11 politician once rejected a plea deal that would have spared his wife entirely			1
they pleaded not guilty and federal magistrate @entity15 released them without bond on friday , but ordered them not to leave the country			1
the @entity21 ' lawyer said in court that his clients have already surrendered their passports			0
trial was set for july 28			0
the @entity26 were charged tuesday with accepting more than $ 165,000 in gifts and loans from the head of @entity30 , a health supplement company , and then bolstering the company 's image through the prestige of @entity36 's top political official			1
indicted : former governor @entity3 and wife @entity4 were released without bail after surrendering their passports on friday but most of that money flowed to mrs @entity41 in the form of expensive clothes , and gifts that she later gave her husband			1
among the items that the @entity21 may have to return - all listed in a federal government 's 14 - count indictment - are a silver @entity50 engraved watch , two sets of golf clubs , two iphones , two @entity56 dresses and @entity58 merchandise including shoes , a purse and a wallet			1
mr @entity3 , the first @entity36 governor ever to face a criminal indictment , insists that he has done nothing wrong , and his attorney paints a picture of a governor blindsided by his wife 's poor judgment			1
the indictment includes an email she sent to one of the governor 's senior staffers , explaining why she accepted one of the @entity56 gowns from @entity30 ceo @entity77			1
' i need to talk to you about inaugural clothing budget , ' she wrote			0
' i need answers and @entity3 is screaming about the thousands i ’m charging up in credit card debt			1
' ' we are broke , have an unconscionable amount in credit card debt already , and this inaugural is killing us ! i need answers and i need help , and i need to get this done			0
' @entity90 could be preparing a defense the would essentially blame his wife for all of the gifts - which could get both of them off the hook , since she did n't wield official power the ex-governor has held fast to his insistence that he 's innocent			1
' i did nothing illegal for mr @entity77 in exchange for what i believed was his personal generosity and friendship , ' mr @entity3 said tuesday in a statement			2
' i never promised – and mr @entity77 and his company never received – any government benefit of any kind from me or my administration			2
we did not violate the law , and i will use every available resource and advocate i have for as long as it takes to fight these false allegations , and to prevail against this unjust overreach of the federal government			0
' he later said in a televised statement that ' i come before you this evening as someone who 's been falsely and wrongly accused			0
' the plea agreement mr @entity3 rejected last year , according to the @entity123 , would have required him to acknowledge only that he filed an incomplete mortgage application when he failed to list money he had borrowed from mr @entity77			2
for mr @entity3 , once considered a possible presidential running mate in 2012 , a political future hinges on a complete exoneration			2
@entity41 wrote in emails that she was worried about money and affording new clothes in her position as first lady - which accounted for the designer gifts so he refused to take the deal , which would have spared him and his family any public hint of corruption charges			1
but now he and his wife face serious criminal counts that allege a conspiracy to trade his official influence for valuable gifts – and for the loans that kept his house from slipping away			1
the @entity21 are a rarity in @entity149 politics , a political family without wealth			0
their attorney is reportedly preparing a legal strategy that will lean on mrs @entity41 and lay most of the blame for their interactions with mr @entity77 at her feet			0
while that may sound callous , it would likely clear both of any criminal wrongdoing , since a governor 's wife does n't technically have the official power to help generous donors or gift - givers			2
' it ’s almost like ships passing in the night			0
where he says , " i did n’t know what she was doing			0
" and she says , " i had no idea what he was doing , " ' former federal prosecutor @entity178 told the @entity123			0
' and the jury is left to decide what ’s reasonable			0
it 's an interesting wrinkle			0
' if it 's determined that the governor himself was unaware of the extent to which mr @entity77 was opening his wallet to subsidize his wife 's expensive tastes , he 'll be off the hook – and @entity11 will be able to crow that his prosecution was ham - fisted and politically motivated			2
democrat @entity192 won the governorship in november , beating @entity194 , @entity3 's state attorney general			2
@entity36 's top three offices – governor , lieutenant governor and attorney general – are all in @entity200 hands at the same time , something that has n't happened since 1989 .			1

couple pleaded not guilty to all charges and were released without bond
@entity3 and wife @entity4 were charged earlier this week with 14 counts of trading influences for gifts they received from ceo of @entity36 firm @entity30
items include @entity56 dresses and @entity58 dresses shoes and handbags for former @entity36 first lady
@entity3 could be planning defense that blames all gifts on wife @entity4 – which could get them both off
