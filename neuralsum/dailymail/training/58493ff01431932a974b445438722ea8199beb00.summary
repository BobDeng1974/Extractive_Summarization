' curmudgeonly ' : the host o @entity2 ’s today programme revealed his daughter had nominated him for the challenge - but has dismissed it as a ' stunt ' it has been embraced by pop stars and politicians and raised millions for charity			1
but @entity13 presenter @entity12 has criticised the @entity14 as a ‘ stunt ’ , saying we should give because we want to help good causes , not because of fads			2
the host of @entity2 ’s today programme revealed his daughter had nominated him for the challenge – in which people donate money after filming themselves being doused in ice water , before nominating someone else			1
famous participants include former @entity29 president @entity28 , pop star @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity33 star @entity32 , raising more than £ 60million for @entity29 motor neurone charity the @entity35 , and more than £ 3million for @entity36 in the @entity37			1
but mr @entity12 , 71 , said : ‘ it ’s certainly been hugely successful at raising awareness of the hideous motor neurone disease and it ’s undoubtedly raised a lot of money			0
‘ but as someone who set up his own modest charity a few years ago , i have mixed feelings about persuading people to support a charity with stunts			1
‘ is it too sanctimonious to say that charity should be about giving because it ’s a worthwhile cause that we really want to help ? ’ writing in @entity54 , he added : ‘ still , it ’s preferable to all those appeals from people who ask for your help for something they ’re madly keen to do anyway			2
‘ we ’ve all had the letters : “ i plan to raise loads of money for my local cats ’ home by cycling around @entity64			2
please help ! ” ‘ i ’m always tempted to reply : “ if you really want to help your local cats ’ home , why not stay home and give them all the money it will cost to send you on a lovely holiday ? ” mr @entity12 – who has a son and daughter with his first wife @entity77 and a 13 - year - old son with @entity13 presenter @entity79 – set up the @entity80 in 2005			1
its purpose is to raise money for other small charities that do not have their own fundraising arms , and it is opposed to ‘ charity as big business ’			2
mr @entity12 admitted his views might seem a little ‘ curmudgeonly ’ , but he said he was dismayed when his editor on today recently joked that he would be expected to complete the @entity14 on air			1
describing his immediate reaction , he said : ‘ unwelcome and , given a moment ’s thought , unlikely – but just about plausible			0
i should be so plucky : @entity96 completes the @entity97 alongside her designer friend @entity99 ‘ it would n’t be the first time we ’d done something daft on today and , given the relentless tide of dire news over the summer , maybe the audience needed a bit of a break			0
‘ but not this ! not on today ! surely my editor was winding me up			0
crisis and potential presenter rebellion averted			0
’ he added : ‘ the problem is , charity has become big business and fundraising is all about clever marketing			0
pity they ca n’t let the cause speak for itself			0
