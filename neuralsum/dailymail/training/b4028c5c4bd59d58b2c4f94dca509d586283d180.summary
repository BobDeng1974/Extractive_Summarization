and it would appear the couple threw themselves into the idea , with the bride looking genuinely petrified as the huge machines dwarf her and her wedding party			1
and now for the sequel ! the pair could n't resist their bridal party getting chased by a squad of @entity33 the menacing @entity20 can be seen stomping through a city in pursuit of the terrified party - and the bride and groom really committed to the picture the groom is in danger of being outrun by a posse of bridesmaids clad in pink - but even in times of panic they have all managed to hang on to their bouquets			1
the image was taken by @entity54 - based @entity53 photography after an image of a bridal party being followed by the huge @entity3 went viral , io9 reported			1
