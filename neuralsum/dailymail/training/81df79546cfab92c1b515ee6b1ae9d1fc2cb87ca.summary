by @entity0 published : 12:58 est , 3 january 2013 updated : 12:59 est , 3 january 2013 the @entity1 has made an urgent appeal for @entity4 blood donors after the early norovirus outbreak and the festive period caused a drop in donations			1
the @entity9 ( @entity9 ) said it had increased stocks of the blood type before @entity12 but high demand meant it was running low			2
more than one million people are believed to have been affected by the vomiting bug outbreak , which led several hospitals to close their doors before @entity12 in a bid to contain its spread			1
an urgent appeal has been made for donors as stocks of @entity4 blood are in low supply an @entity9 spokesman said : ' blood stocks can often dip around holiday time as people get distracted and ca nâ€™t always attend their sessions			1
' in addition , the recent outbreak of norovirus has led to a dramatic increase in the number of people correctly cancelling their appointments			0
' non-attendance by @entity4 donors increased by 50 per cent just before @entity38			1
' donors with @entity4 blood make up around seven per cent of the population and are known as the ' universal donor ' as their blood can safely be given to patients with a different blood group			1
this can prove vital in an emergency situation where there may not be time for an immediate blood group testing to be carried out			0
about 100,000 people were struck down with the winter vomiting bug over @entity12 according to the latest figures , with the number of confirmed cases 72 per cent higher than this time last year			1
the dramatic rise was attributed in part to an early outbreak of the illness which closed dozens of hospital wards as it swept across the country			0
1.1 million people are said to have been affected by @entity63 ( shown here under a microscope ) during the two weeks up to december 30 , there were 29 hospital outbreaks reported , compared with 70 in the previous fortnight , bringing the total for the season to 590			0
a total of 3,877 laboratory - confirmed cases of norovirus have now been recorded in @entity74 and @entity75 - up on the 2,255 of last year			0
but the @entity76 ( @entity76 ) said that for every reported case , an estimated 288 were not flagged up , meaning about 1.12 million people could have contracted the illness this season			0
blood stocks are also needed for patients being treated for diseases like cancer and leukaemia , with anyone aged 17 upward who is in generally good health a potential donor			2
@entity89 , assistant director of marketing for @entity91 , said : ' we would like to urge all @entity4 negative donors to walk into their most convenient donor session to give blood to help rebuild stock levels			2
' we are always grateful to donors who respond to calls such as this and appreciate that in doing so they do give up some of their precious time			0
' waiting times may vary in the next few days as we try to accommodate all donors			0
' demand for blood never stops and @entity4 negative donors can help to ensure healthy blood stocks in the upcoming weeks , by giving blood now and in the next few days			1

stocks of @entity4 blood - which can be given to people of different blood groups - are in low supply
non-attendance by donors increased by 50 per cent just before @entity38 *due* to winter vomiting bug
