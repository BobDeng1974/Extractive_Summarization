the @entity10 reported that the ranking @entity11 on the @entity12 would see charges filed in his native @entity3 , citing people familiar with the @entity16 's investigation			2
the allegations against @entity2 involve claims that he used his office to promote the business interests of a @entity7 donor and close friend in exchange for personal gifts			0
@entity2 has denied any wrongdoing , vowing that he is ' not going anywhere			0
' but a grand jury probe that has lasted for two years coudl complicate his future			2
the senator : sen. @entity2 , a @entity3 @entity11 , may soon face criminal charges related to alleged corruption politics : ( l - r ) @entity2 , donor @entity33 , @entity35 minority leader @entity34 , and her husband @entity36 , posed in february 2012 at a @entity37 gala @entity2 , 61 , has seen pressure from the @entity41 administration over his positions on @entity43 and @entity44 , leading some republicans who share his foreign policy views to suspect that the @entity35 is exacting retribution on him			1
but more troubling are the ethics questions lingering about @entity2 's relationship with @entity50 eye doctor @entity33 , a wealthy and prolific donor			1
the senator 's aides admitted in 2013 that he had intervened a year earlier with the acting chief of the @entity54 on his friend 's behalf , pushing back against accusations of overbilling the @entity54 system by $ 8.9 million			1
@entity2 has also repaid @entity33 $ 58,500 for the value of plane trips he took on the doctor 's private jet , mostly to the posh @entity62 resot @entity63			1
but his spokeswoman fiercely denied he has done anything illegal even as a conservative group is calling for him to resign and face the music			0
@entity68 , @entity2 's communications director , told @entity69 in a statement earlier this month that ' we believe all of the senator 's actions have been appropriate and lawful and the facts will ultimately confirm that			2
' ' any actions taken by @entity77 or his office have been to appropriately address public policy issues and not for any other reason			0
' ' the senator has counted dr. @entity33 as one of his closest personal friends for decades , ' @entity68 said			1
' the two have spent holidays together and have gone to each other ’s family funerals and weddings and have exchanged personal gifts			0
' @entity90 : attorney general @entity91 would n't talk on friday about whether charges are forthcoming for @entity2 , saying ' i ca n't comment ' she called the investigation 's beginnings ' suspect , ' referring to ' false allegations ' that have been ' discredited ' in the past			0
meanwhile , the conservative activist group @entity100 has called on @entity2 to resign his office			0
on a new website called @entity104 , the group claims he ' unethically , and likely criminally , compromised his ability to represent the people of @entity3			0
' @entity107 reported that the investigation into @entity2 is reaching a crescendo , with prosecutors under pressure to complete their work before the statute of limitations runs out on some charges			0
attorney general @entity91 , according to the network , has already given his approval			0
but he insisted ' i ca n't comment on that ' when a reporter asked him about the report friday afternoon after @entity41 gave a speech in @entity123			0
@entity2 's first high - level meeting at @entity125 related to @entity33 's @entity54 troubles occurred on june 7 , 2012 , according to court documents seen by the @entity128			1

the senator , now the ranking @entity11 on the @entity12 and its chairman until two months ago , has become a thorn in the @entity35 's side by taking positions that grate on president @entity41			0
@entity2 opposed the presdient 's rapprochement with @entity43 strongman @entity159 , saying in december that his actions ' have vindicated the brutal behavior of the @entity43 government			2
' he has stood in the way of the @entity165 's negotiations with @entity44 , threatening to lead @entity166 in imposing new sanctions on the @entity168 if it does n't shelve its nuclear ambitions			0
the @entity35 has insisted the @entity44 can be trusted to keep their end of any bargain			0
' i have to be honest with you , ' @entity2 said during a january 21 @entity176 hearing			0
' the more i hear from the administration and its quotes , the more it sounds like talking points that come straight out of @entity181			0
' while he is not among the senate 's super-rich elites , the @entity3 legislator will likely have the capital on hand to fight the charges : his legal defense fund has already collected , and spent , more than $ 1 million			2
last week two of his @entity12 aides tried to avoid testifying before the federal grand jury in the case , arguing that the senator 's actions , and theirs , are protected by the @entity197 @entity196 's ' @entity199 ' clause			1

the x-ray machines are used by customs and port security officials to screen cargo for narcotics and other contraband			2
@entity247 - politics : dr. @entity33 controlled a company that wanted a @entity62 ports contract to sell x-ray equipment used to screen cargo containers for drugs			1
@entity2 allegedly helped ensure the @entity197 would n't provide the machines for free in 2013 @entity16 agents and investigators from @entity125 raided @entity33 's @entity256 , @entity50 medical office , @entity258			1
over a period of nearly 24 hours , then executed search warrants and came out with dozens of boxes containing whatnews reports later described as medical and billing records and computer files			0
the @entity265 reported at the time that @entity125 auditors had raised red flags over the large number of eye surgeries and laser treatments @entity33 's practice billed to @entity54			1
