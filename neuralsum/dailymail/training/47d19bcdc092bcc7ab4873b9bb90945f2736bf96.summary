spanking and whipping should not be banned in @entity3 - made online porn videos , @entity0 have demanded			1
backbench mp @entity4 attacked rules revealed last week which ban a host of erotic acts considered ' harmful ' by ministers			1
the new laws aim to bring ' video - on - demand ' online porn into line with videos sold in licensed sex shops			1
it means around 10 acts - ranging from spanking to strangulation , aggressive whipping and being tied up – are now banned from web porn sold in the @entity3			1
mr @entity4 has tabled a @entity21 motion calling for the new rules – laid down in the @entity23 – to be annulled			1
mr @entity4 , mp for @entity25 , said the new rules ' mean that all video - on - demand services that originate from the @entity3 ca n't show various acts , such as spanking '			1
he said : ' it seems to me to be very odd to say that this - assuming it is consensual - is acceptable for somebody to do in their own home , for them to photograph it , film it , but not to look at it online if it comes from the @entity3			2
' to me the case for banning things should be driven by issues around consent , and around genuine risk , not about whether we happen to like things or not			0
' banned content includes ' the portrayal of sexual activity which involves real or apparent lack of consent ' and ' the infliction of pain or acts which may cause lasting physical harm '			0
this effectively outlaws acts including physical or verbal abuse ( whether or not it is consensual ) , physical restraint , caning and strangulation			2
a government spokesman said : ' the legislation provides the same level of protection to the online world that exists on the high street in relation to the sale of physical dvds			0
' in a converging media world these provisions must be coherent and the @entity77 classification regime is a tried and tested system of what content is regarded as harmful for minors			0
' but critics argue the change not only damages the country 's porn industry , with online viewers still able to access content banned in the @entity3 by watching videos filmed abroad , but amounts to ' arbitrary censorship '			2
a number of ' @entity92 ' style sex acts have been banned from online porn made in the @entity3			1
a movie based on the erotic novel is currently being made staring @entity96 and @entity97 ( pictured ) spanking and whipping , which are featured in the saucy novel @entity92 , are on the banned list , as well as : aggressive whipping physical or verbal abuse ( regardless of if consensual ) strangulation @entity102 , founder of anti-censorship campaign @entity103 , told @entity105 : ' r18 is a strange thing			1
' it 's a set of weird and arbitrary censorship rules decided between the @entity77 , the police and the @entity111 ( @entity111 )			0
' there appear to be no rational explanations for most of the r18 rules - they 're simply a set of moral judgments designed by people who have struggled endlessly to stop the @entity3 people from watching pornography			0
' the @entity23 2014 came in to effect on monday			0
erotic film director @entity121 told the @entity122 : ' with this legislation , the @entity3 is in danger of finding itself back in an age where porn is simply the boring , unrealistic , male fantasy of bimbos eagerly pleasing men as if it is their duty , where women are submissive and lack ownership of their sexuality			2
' women in the industry will now fear the loss of their livelihoods as well as their sexual independence			0
