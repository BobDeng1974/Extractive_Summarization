@entity0 deserved their victory at @entity2 on sunday and there were two players at the heart of it all			1
@entity7 was fantastic but @entity8 was the best player on the pitch			1
on saturday , i said his battle with @entity12 would be key to the game			2
there ’s no doubt who won that one			0
he put in an all - action display and ran the game			0
he looked like the player we all felt he could become when he emerged at @entity23			1
as for @entity27 , for a young man to play like that on his first visit to @entity2 was magnificent			1
@entity7 , @entity8 and @entity28 celebrate as @entity0 reached the @entity30 final @entity8 shoots and scores against @entity33 goalkeeper @entity32 to put @entity0 ahead at @entity2 he is quick but has a languid style , like @entity35			1
when he drops his shoulder he sends defenders so far the other way they almost have to pay to get back in			1
@entity39 has done a brilliant job with @entity0			1
i was at @entity2 and their fans turned up with a sense of expectancy , something they have not had in a long time			1
@entity39 deserves huge credit for that			1
he has ignited that team and got their passion and excitement back			1
@entity8 and @entity27 , pictured with @entity52 inside the dressing room , impressed at @entity2 @entity27 is quick and has a languid style similar to former @entity33 and @entity55 star @entity35 @entity57 home advantage could be key april 25 - @entity58 ( a ) apr 29 - @entity59 ( @entity60 ) may 2 - @entity61 ( @entity60 ) may 9 - @entity62 ( @entity60 ) may 16 - @entity63 ( a ) may 24 - @entity64 ( @entity60 ) of the three promoted teams fighting for their lives at the bottom , @entity65 look the most likely to stay up			1
they are the form team down there right now			0
when you ’re in a relegation scrap , nothing boosts your confidence quite like goals			0
that ’s why @entity65 have been able to drag themselves off the bottom of the table			1
they have scored 10 in their last four , including three at @entity82 in a game they were unlucky to lose 4 - 3			1
now they have won three games in a row - a winning streak only @entity88 ( 8 ) and @entity59 ( 4 ) can beat			1
they have good pace up front with @entity91 , and @entity92 finally found his shooting boots with a goal against @entity95			0
the key for @entity65 now is that , of their six remaining games , four of them are at home			1
that home advantage could be the difference between staying up or going down			1
@entity92 celebrates with @entity65 team - mate @entity103 during the foxes win over @entity95 que sera , sera of course , for sentimental reasons i wanted @entity107 and @entity33 to get to the final			1
what better way for one of @entity33 ’s greatest ever players to depart the club than with an @entity30 win ? it is a shame he wo n’t be there but he has probably achieved more at @entity33 than he would ever have dreamed of			1
and if there ’s anybody who thinks about the team rather than himself , it ’s @entity120			0
he will be devastated not to make the final but for the club ’s sake , not his			1
@entity107 looks dejected after @entity33 's @entity30 semi-final defeat to @entity0 on sunday @entity33 captain @entity107 will be devastated at not reaching the @entity30 final but for the club 's sake , not his winning the @entity30 would have been the perfect send off for @entity107 who is leaving @entity33 for @entity128 @entity59 just do what 's needed 1 - @entity59 have lost just one of their last 13 @entity132 home games against @entity133 ( 3 - 2 in oct 2012 ) , winning eight and drawing four it 's difficult to be critical of a side like @entity59			1
they have an incredible record at home and an uncanny ability to win the big games			1
that ’s exactly what happened against @entity133 on saturday			0
people say it was a tactical masterplan to play @entity146 in midfield to stop @entity148			0
i ’m not so sure			0
yes , @entity148 has been effective in recent weeks but i do n’t think we ’ve got to the stage where he needs to be man - marked			0
@entity59 are a good enough team to beat @entity133 without resorting to that			0
but you can not argue with the results			0
@entity59 have developed a ruthless , efficient style			0
since losing to @entity82 on @entity156 they are unbeaten in the league			0
in their last two games they have had three shots on target			2
two of them have gone in and they have won both games 1 - 0			2
that ’s how to grind out a title			0
the @entity133 game was @entity168 ’s 102nd clean sheet out of 190 games in the @entity132			2
he knows exactly what ’s needed to bring home the trophies			2
no wonder @entity174 looked so delighted after the final whistle			2
@entity146 ( right ) and @entity148 battle for the ball during @entity59 's 1 - 0 victory over @entity133 @entity59 manager @entity168 knows how to grind out a title and has kept 102 clean sheets in 190 matches @entity59 owner @entity174 shows his delight in the stands at @entity184 during saturday 's win pressure 's on for @entity88 i ’m sure most neutrals wanted to see @entity88 play @entity33 in the @entity30 final , and plenty of @entity88 fans will be happy to see @entity0 there instead			1
but they will have to be careful			0
against @entity193 and @entity194 last year , and @entity195 this time around , @entity88 have made hard work of these games			2
the pressure will be all on them and they will have to compete with the energy of that @entity0 midfield			1
it will certainly make for another absorbing final			2
@entity88 celebrate during the win over @entity195 but will have to be careful against @entity0 in the @entity30 final @entity58 must keep believing april 25 - @entity65 ( @entity60 ) may 2 - @entity205 ( a ) may 9 - @entity194 ( a ) may 16 - @entity206 ( @entity60 ) may 24 - @entity0 ( a ) for @entity208 and his side , their season starts now			1
@entity58 have been on a poor run and another defeat this weekend has added to their worries			0
they have only scored one goal in their last seven games , although that was a significant winner against @entity216			1
but that is a desperate drought that has seen them sink right to the bottom of the table			0
their top scorer @entity221 has not scored since february though it has been difficult for him — i ’m sure he ’s got other things on his mind with so much speculation about his future			2
he has had a decent season but he has suffered from a lack of support and that is a problem			0
@entity58 's top scorer @entity221 has not scored since february and has not suffered from a lack of support only two other @entity58 players have scored more than twice all season - @entity241 and @entity240 with five each			1
it ’s hard to see where their next goal is coming from			0
but for @entity208 the fixture list has been kind			0
some of their relegation rivals have still got to face the top sides but the highest - placed team @entity58 have to face are @entity206 in ninth			0
@entity208 and his team only have five games left but there ’s no reason why they ca n’t get something from each one of them			2
@entity58 players look dejected following saturday 's 1 - 0 defeat at @entity259 and are not bottom of the table awards season @entity262 is only the fourth @entity82 player to score 20 + goals in a @entity132 season after @entity264 , @entity265 and @entity266			1
i have said throughout the second half of the season that the @entity271 award will be between @entity272 and @entity273			0
@entity274 , @entity275 and @entity276 have all done well but those two have been consistently excellent			0
over the last six games there ’s no doubt @entity272 ’s performances should have that contest wrapped up			2
he has been nothing short of brilliant in the games that really matter			2
@entity262 has been the best thing about @entity82 ’s season			0
he has rescued their front line and i would be amazed if he does n’t win @entity289			0
i prefer watching attacking players doing exciting things and he has done that all season			0
he came from nowhere and he has been one of the stories of the year			0
the @entity271 award will be between @entity59 's @entity272 ( left ) and @entity82 's @entity273 ( right )			2

@entity8 and @entity7 impressed for @entity0 at @entity2
@entity0 captain @entity8 scored to send @entity39 's men to @entity30 final
@entity27 is a similar player to former @entity55 star @entity35
@entity0 boss @entity39 has got the club 's passion and excitement back
@entity65 look the most likely of the promoted clubs to stay up
the foxes have six games remaining , four of which are at home
