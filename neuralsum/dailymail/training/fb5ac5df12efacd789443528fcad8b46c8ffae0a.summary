by @entity0 older men who take statins to combat high cholesterol are less likely to exercise regularly , a new study has found			1
researchers in @entity6 have raised fears about a decline in physical activity among men who take the medication - one of the most widely prescribed in the world			1
statins are credited with saving thousands of lives a year by preventing heart attacks and strokes			0
older men who take statins to help combat a high cholesterol are less likely to take regular exercise , a study has found the study could not pinpoint why men who took statins exercised or not			1
rather , they confirmed a link between those that take the drug and a lack of physical activity			0
scientists said possible causes could include muscle pain that can be a side effect of taking statins			0
lead author of the study , @entity34 , an assistant professor in the @entity35 and the @entity36 and @entity37 , said : ' physical activity in older adults helps to maintain a proper weight , prevent cardiovascular disease and helps to maintain physical strength and function			2
' we 're trying to find ways to get older adults to exercise more , not less			2
it 's a fairly serious concern if use of statins is doing something that makes people less likely to exercise			1
' he said five to 30 per cent of people who take statins complain of suffering muscle pain , while some report feeling less energetic , weak or tired			1
in a study of 3,071 men aged 65 or older , from six geographic regions in the @entity58 , researchers found that men who took statins averaged about 40 minutes less of moderate physical activity over a one - week period , compared to those who were not taking the medication			1
researchers said a link between taking statins and experiencing muscle pain and fatigue could be a reason for a lack of physical activity in those taking the drugs			1
file picture dr @entity34 said it would equate to the loss of 150 minutes a week of slow - paced walking			0
he said : ' for an older population that ’s already pretty sedentary , that ’s a significant amount less exercise			2
' even moderate amounts of exercise can make a big difference			0
' the @entity6 study also found that new statin users had the largest drop in physical activity			1
an increase in sedentary behaviour , which is associated with all - cause mortality and death from cardiovascular disease , was also found in those taking the drugs			2
' given these results , we should be aware of a possible decrease in physical activity among people taking a statin , ' @entity34 said			0
' this could decrease the benefit of the medication			0
' if someone is already weak , frail , or sedentary , they may want to consider this issue , and consult with their doctor to determine if statin use is still appropriate			2
' the study focused on older men and researchers highlighted it may not be pertinent to apply the same theory to older women			1
; last month an eminent @entity112 heart surgeon declared that everyone over the age of 40 should take cholesterol - busting statins			0
professor sir @entity116 , who has carried out more heart transplants than anyone else , said the benefits of taking the controversial drugs ‘ massively ’ outweigh the risks and to not make them more widely available is ‘ lunacy ’			0
sir @entity116 , professor of cardiothoracic surgery at @entity126 , also believes statins should be available without a prescription .			0

study in @entity6 found older men on statins are less likely to exercise
statins are widely prescribed to help combat high cholesterol
in the @entity58 around a third of older people take the medication
researchers urged doctors to consider if frail , weak or sedentary older men are *suitable* to be prescribed the drugs
