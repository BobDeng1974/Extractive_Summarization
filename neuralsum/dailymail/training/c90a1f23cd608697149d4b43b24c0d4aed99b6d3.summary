the @entity1 - controlled @entity0 voted tuesday to condemn president @entity2 for failing to give 30 - day notice to @entity4 about the exchange in may of @entity7 prisoner @entity6 for five @entity9 leaders held at the @entity7 prison at @entity11 , @entity12			1
the vote was 249 - 163 , with 22 democrats — many locked in tough re-election races — breaking ranks and backing the nonbinding resolution			1
' by setting free five top @entity9 commanders from @entity7 custody , the @entity2 administration made @entity7 less safe , ' speaker @entity19 said in a statement			1
a @entity36 report last month also reached that conclusion			0
' the administration deprived @entity4 of the opportunity to consider the national security risk or the repercussions of negotiating with terrorists , ' @entity39 chairman @entity38 said			2
five senior @entity9 were released from the @entity7 prison at @entity11 in exchange for the @entity31 sergeant who had disappeared from his post in @entity48 in eastern @entity49 on june 30 , 2009			1
the five @entity9 men are to remain in @entity51 for a year			0
@entity1 lawmakers and some @entity14 were angry with @entity2 and members of the administration for failing to notify them about the swap even as 80 to 90 members of the government knew of the exchange			1
the administration has offered a number of explanations for keeping @entity4 in the dark , including concern about @entity6 's health and safety required speedy action and concern that lawmakers would divulge details of the deal and scuttle it			2
@entity2 has said his constitutional authority as commander in chief superseded the law to apprise lawmakers			2
rep. @entity75 of @entity76 , the top @entity77 on @entity78 , said the president should have notified @entity4			0
but the resolution passed by the @entity0 was a partisan attack by a @entity1 on a @entity14 president , said @entity75 , who has claimed @entity1 president @entity83 repeatedly violated the law with post- sept. 11 warrantless wiretaps and indefinite detentions			1
awkward : the @entity0 passed the resolution as president @entity2 , center , was meeting with @entity4 leadership , including speaker of the house @entity19 ( 2nd - left ) , senate minority leader @entity91 ( left ) , senate majority leader @entity92 ( 2nd - right ) and @entity0 minority leader @entity93 , in the @entity94 at the @entity0 @entity14 rep. @entity95 suggested that the @entity0 vote on the measure less than two months before the election was simply an effort to appease core @entity1 voters			1
meanwhile , rep. @entity101 of @entity102 , a @entity14 congressman who faces a challenging re-election this fall , backed the resolution , complaining that @entity2 negotiated with terrorists and treated @entity4 as an afterthought			1
some in @entity4 have said @entity6 was a deserter and the @entity7 gave up too much for his freedom			2
several lawmakers have cited intelligence suggesting the high - level @entity9 officials could return to the @entity49 battlefield			0
the @entity0 resolution , which lacks the force of law and wo n't be considered in the @entity115 , ' condemns and disapproves of the failure of the @entity2 administration to comply with the lawful 30 - day statutory reporting requirement in executing the transfer of five senior members of the @entity9 from detention at @entity122 , @entity11 , @entity12			1
' the measure says these actions ' have burdened unnecessarily the trust and confidence in the commitment and ability of the @entity2 administration to constructively engage and work with @entity4			1
' the resolution does express relief that @entity6 has returned safely to the @entity7			0
the @entity131 has unanimously supported the exchange and contend that the @entity7 has a sacred commitment to men and women who serve that it will never leave anyone behind on the battlefield			0
army gen. @entity139 , the chairman of the @entity131 , said the swap in may was ' likely our last , best opportunity ' to free @entity6			0
@entity6 is performing administrative duties at @entity144 in @entity145 while an investigation into how he was captured by the @entity9 is conducted			0
the vote castigating @entity2 on tuesday came at a crucial moment for the administration as it sought to rally international and congressional support for steps to combat the rising threat of islamic state militants in @entity154 and @entity155			2
the debate and vote coincided with a @entity0 meeting in which the president discussed his strategy to defeat @entity161 with @entity0 and @entity115 leaders			0
it also came on the eve of @entity2 's address to the nation			0
' what poor timing for a resolution , ' said @entity14 rep. @entity169 .			0

the vote was 249 - 163 , with 22 democrats — many locked in tough re-election races — breaking ranks and backing the nonbinding resolution
