the whistleblower who caught an mp playing @entity4 during a @entity6 meeting will face no punishment , a @entity1 watchdog revealed today			1
a leaked photo showed @entity10 @entity9 playing the game on his taxpayer - funded @entity12 when he was supposed to be listening to evidence on pensions and insurance			1
but instead of investigating the mp , who remains on the @entity17 , @entity6 officials launched a probe into who leaked the photo			1
footage of the meeting , held last monday , showed a male and a female sound technician sitting behind mr @entity9 who both appeared to be using mobile phones			1
however , it was not clear if one of them was responsible for filming him or whether another person off - camera captured his gaming on film			2
a @entity6 spokesman insisted the investigation was ' standard procedure ' because it is against parliamentary rules to film inside @entity56 without permission			2
those who break the rules can be barred from the parliamentary estate , which includes @entity62 ' offices and meeting rooms			1
today , just a day after the probe was launched , it was confirmed the whistleblower will face no further action			1
distracted : the mp for @entity69 in @entity70 was spotted closely studying his @entity12 and swiping the screen with his finger as he attempted to complete levels of popular app the @entity4 apology : mr @entity9 vowed he would not play the game - popular even with @entity77 - in meetings again a @entity80 spokesman said : ' it is standard procedure that any breach of the filming and photography rules brought to the attention of the @entity80 is investigated			1
' the @entity87 has concluded the investigation into this breach and has issued a reminder of the current rules ; no further action will be taken			0
' the @entity87 , a post which dates to the 1400s , has scope to impose low - level punishments while ' serious breaches ' are reported to the @entity98			2
the spokesman could not confirm whether the whistleblower was actually tracked down or whether the ' reminder ' was a general one			2
mr @entity9 , who is defending a majority of just 536 in @entity69 , initially told @entity104 he would ' try ' not to be distracted by the game again			1
he later issued a full apology , saying : ' i apologise unreservedly for my behaviour at the committee meeting and realise it fell short of what is expected of a member of parliament			2
addictive : candy crush is incredibly popular - with more than 700 million games played on mobile devices ‘ i guarantee it will not happen again			0
' it is a fantastic privilege to represent @entity69 and i hope constituents will continue to support my campaigns			0
' @entity121 , a @entity122 councillor in his constituency , said : ‘ i think it ’s disgusting			0
he ’s an mp and i find it very worrying			0
’ more than a billion people every day play the ' addictive ' game @entity4 , in which players have to line up at least three sweets of the same colour in a row on a constantly - shifting grid			0
@entity77 – himself a self - confessed games addict – defended mr @entity9			1
‘ i know him well , he fights very hard in his constituency for people in @entity70 , he works very hard in @entity140 , ’ the prime minister said			0
‘ i ’m sure he will be embarrassed and he will work even harder in the future			0
’ mr @entity77 previously admitted to being addicted to mobile games @entity143 and @entity144			0
asked what level the @entity137 had reached on @entity4 , his spokesman said : ‘ on that line of questioning , @entity147			0
