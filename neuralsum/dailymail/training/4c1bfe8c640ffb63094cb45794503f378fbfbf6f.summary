by @entity0 published : 18:52 est , 11 november 2013 updated : 18:00 est , 12 november 2013 they are the cream of @entity4 's academic crop			0
but when it comes to extracurricular activities , these @entity6 students appear to have hit rock bottom			1
the ten undergraduates - five female and five male - have taken risque photographs of their behinds in a bid to be crowned ' @entity16 '			1
cheeky : @entity18 , from @entity19 , poses naked in a library in a bid to be crowned ' @entity16 ' not camera - shy : @entity22 , left , and @entity23 , right , have no qualms about posing for these risque photographs they can be seen posing naked in a range of locations around the institution - including a library , a laundry room and university halls			1
they have submitted the photos - using only their first names - to independent student website @entity37 as part of its ' @entity16 ' competition			1
one image shows @entity18 , a second year student at @entity19 , standing naked in a library while looking down at a book			1
another depicts @entity22 , from @entity45 , posing nude in front of a row of washing machines			1
contest : the ten undergraduates have submitted the photographs to independent student website @entity37 one girl called @entity53 , a student of @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56 , is depicted in what appears to be her room in @entity59			0
while @entity23 , who is reading @entity60 at @entity61 , is pictured with a ' keep off the grass ' sign - and not much else - in the university grounds			0
another entrant called @entity65 , from @entity66 , can be seen standing naked in front of one of the institution 's historic doors			2
all of the undergraduates are completely naked from the waist down - with the exception of @entity74 who is pictured in a pair of pink knickers			2
hope : @entity78 , left , and @entity79 , right , are among the contenders hoping to scoop the title of ' @entity16 ' on show : all of the students are naked - apart from @entity84 , right , who is pictured in a pair of pink knickers an ' interesting fact ' accompanies each photo on the website - with @entity23 's comment claiming she wrote her entire dissertation in the nude			1
the competition has been split into ' male ' and ' female ' individual contests - with all entrants posing naked ' voluntarily '			1
organisers are encouraging other students at the prestigious academic institution to vote for their favourite rears			2
@entity100 all : @entity102 , who is reading @entity103 at @entity104 , bares all for the camera the winners will gain free entry to the @entity108 , worth a paltry Â£ 2			0
however , not everyone is supportive of the competition , which is being run for the second time despite strong opposition from women 's groups last year			0
@entity115 , women 's officer at @entity117 , has condemned the online poll as ' irresponsible '			2
in a joint statement with @entity120 , from @entity121 , she said : ' this is an example of immature , blind and irresponsible behaviour on the part of @entity37 editors			0
' i sincerely hope they will take responsibility for the harm caused , not only to the women depicted but also to the broader community , for reinforcing sexism and exclusion			0
' @entity37 should immediately remove the photos , publish an apology and mandate that all future publications can not include the misuse and appropriation of women 's and other minorities ' bodies			2
' however , one female student involved in the stunt - who wishes to remain unnamed - has spoken out in support of the competition			0
' my bum is in its prime , it 's only downhill from here , ' she said			0
' it was now or never really			0
" a male contender for the ' @entity16 ' title added : ' i 'll be very upset if i do n't win			1
' the @entity37 has declined to comment on the poll , while @entity6 officials have said they will not be speaking to the website 's editors about the competition .			1
