@entity0 is a big bear of a man			1
big beard , big hands , big build			2
by his own admission he is ' the spitting image ' of his father @entity8 , and thinks his dad would be his size if he had n't spent much of his life on a @entity14 diet			1
both men love to eat			2
@entity0 loves nothing better than to cook huge macho meals			1
he 's big on meat			1
in fact his new book @entity24 , with its instructions on how to build a barbecue from scratch , is possibly the most macho cookbook ever written			1
the menu has years of experience behind it and a secret ingredient of homeliness he says he inherited from his mother , former cheerleader @entity43			2
@entity0 wants a new generation of men to get out there and barbecue for a crowd			1
' i want to inspire people who 've done it before and give them something more			2
most of the recipes in the book are for eight to ten people , and i have great memories of sitting around big tables with lots of food and a little too much to drink			2
i wanted to reproduce those experiences			2
' @entity0 , at 46 , is the eldest of @entity8 's four children ( two by @entity43 , two by his second wife , screenwriter @entity64 )			1
his parents ' 14 - year marriage fell apart when @entity0 was about 12 , just as @entity8 was starting to make it as an actor ; for most of @entity0 's childhood his father was a carpenter			1
in the past @entity8 has blamed his split with @entity0 's mother on his new - found fame , and it was while he was going through that first divorce that he met his second wife			1
@entity8 with his first wife @entity43 ( @entity0 's mother ) in 1977 their marriage lasted 18 years before he met @entity80 , who played @entity81 , in 2002 and they married in 2010			1
@entity0 says that his father and @entity80 often come to his restaurant with @entity80 's 13 - year - old son @entity85 – @entity8 loves the food – and they all get on very well			1
' but there were n't so many celebrity friends when my parents were together , ' he adds			2
' as the eldest son i missed out on the fun			2
my father was doing a lot of carpentry back then , and he only started to find success as i was becoming a teenager			2
@entity99 was always fixing up the house , and he 'd often take me to building sites , show me the floor joists , how everything fitted together			2
seeing how meticulous he was at his craft has stayed with me as a chef			1
' as you might expect from the life - changing times when he became @entity110 in @entity111 , my parents split up			2
but i had a wonderful stepfather in @entity113 , who was a director of shows like @entity115 and @entity116 and loved to cook			2
i feel like i got the best of it , it was a good situation			2
' @entity0 with his father and stepmother @entity80 @entity8 's career began to take him all over the world – he 's in @entity124 at the moment , of course , shooting the new @entity111 film ; he broke his left leg on set last month – but @entity0 says the two were never estranged			1
' my father was definitely around when i was growing up			2
he was a constant , and he likes to cook too			0
i gave him a copy of my book for @entity134 , so i hope he 's cracked it open and is experimenting for summer , but it 's difficult for people to enjoy food in @entity14			1
i 'm a much bigger version of my dad , so i understand what it takes for him to look like he does			0
i cook all the time			0
' @entity0 grew up wanting to play baseball professionally until a serious knee injury put paid to his dreams and he switched careers at a time when chefs thrived on a culture of aggression in the kitchen			1
' it was hard at first , ' he says			0
' i had a couple of instances where i had to work for tough , belligerent chefs			0
it 's fiercely competitive if you 're working anywhere worth its salt			1
it takes a particular kind of muscle , which is something i find a lot of satisfaction in because not everyone can do it			0
you 're on your feet 14 , sometimes 16 hours a day , six days a week			0
it 's a lot of sacrifice			1
' it certainly takes its toll on the personal life			0
' yes , ' he nods wearily			0
his first marriage to tv news producer @entity172 produced a 13 - year - old son , @entity174 , and he has four - year - old @entity175 from his happy second marriage to @entity177 , who works in his restaurant business			1
growing up with a famous parent can open doors but it can also create a lot of pressure			0
' i found it more difficult than rewarding at times , ' he admits			0
@entity0 's cookbook , taming the feast contains some of @entity0 's most manly meaty recipes ' you want to be one of the guys you 're working with , but sometimes that was hard for me			1
also there was less trust in my commitment to the profession			0
people thought , " he does n't need it as much as the next guy			0
" it has its advantages too			0
it would be silly to shun the attention			0
but when i was younger i felt unworthy of that attention			0
' @entity0 says he 'll always remember when his father first started making money and they had a fancy holiday in @entity212			1
he saw a whole pig being cooked on the beach and it was a pivotal moment for him			0
a whole roasted pig is now one of his signature dishes			0
he got his passion for roasting when he came to visit his father shooting @entity220 at @entity221 in @entity222			0
' they were shooting so many films there at that time			0
wandering around the sets would be fun , there was @entity228 and @entity229			0
at weekends we always seemed to go to someone 's home , never to a restaurant , for a sunday roast			1
' @entity0 was one of the first to offer whole - animal cuisine – now in vogue – at his first restaurant back in 1999			1
he was also one of the first restaurateurs to employ foragers , who gather wild ingredients from hedgerows and woods , which is ultra-chic in @entity36 right now			1
but none of it would have happened , he says , without his mother 's cooking			1
' when i was growing up my mum would make a simple roast chicken but it was the best i 've ever had			0
i still ca n't reproduce it after 28 years of trying			0
she still makes the roast chicken , ' he says sadly			0
' she has @entity256 and it 's progressive			1
' at times it 's seemed as though the nurturing force of his mother 's chicken has got the family through her health crisis			1
' food is more of a nurturing force in my mother 's house than in my father 's			1
my mum is a very special person			0
she and my father are still friends			0
that she was able to stay friends for her children says how special she is			0
' i get the impression that however competitive @entity0 is , he does n't ever want to make a roast chicken better than his mother 's			1
