@entity8 is a new app which lets you add enemies to your @entity1 profile - including real victims from your friends list , or from other users of the app. you can also declare war on any product , person or company that has a presence on @entity1			1
@entity1 's @entity23 hq : @entity8 lets users of the social network add ' enemies ' to their profiles , including people , pages and groups as soon as you have declared someone - or something - an enemy , they appear on your profile on your enemies list , visible to other users of the app. its creator , @entity39 of the @entity41 at @entity42 , describes the app as ' social media blasphemy ' - and predicted that @entity1 would remove the app. a petition signed by three million people called for an ' unlike ' button on @entity1 , but so far the social network has yet to offer such a facility			1
at time of writing , five users had opened hostilities with the twilight series of films , two had declared their opposition to tomatoes and one person had made an enemy of @entity60 - winning @entity62 author @entity61			2
' when i saw the first friends list at the beginning of the social media era , i thought where ’s the enemies list ? ' says @entity69 is an attempt to further define relationships between users and other entities across @entity1 ’s social graph			1
' most social networks attempt to connect people based on affinities : you like a certain band or film or sports team , i like them , therefore we should be friends			2
but people are also connected and motivated by things they dislike			0
' ' we give them a couple of weeks at best before they shut us down , ' says @entity39			0
' a few people have asked us about the potential for misuse			0
if you are not friends with someone , or not a user of the app , or generally not famous , you can not be listed as an ' enemy '			0
we will also monitor the app closely for abuse			0

@entity8 lets you declare people , pages or groups to be enemies

maker says it is ' social media blasphemy '
