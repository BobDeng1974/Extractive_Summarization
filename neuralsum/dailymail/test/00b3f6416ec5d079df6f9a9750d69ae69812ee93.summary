@entity0 made a triumphant return to @entity2 to nudge @entity3 one step closer to the @entity5			1
an academy product and @entity10 ’ youngest captain since @entity8 before moving to @entity6 for £ 2million in january 2012 , @entity0 marked his first game back at his old club by making the breakthrough in the 57th minute to keep @entity15 ’s side in the automatic promotion places			1
the 26 - year - old had already endured taunts of ‘ cheat ’ from the home fans after winning a first - half penalty when he was bundled over by current @entity10 skipper @entity22			1
@entity0 ( 8 ) refuses to celebrate after putting @entity3 ahead early in the second half the midfielder smashed home to put his side in control and continue their automatic promotion charge @entity30 hammered his spot - kick against the underside of the ball and then wasted another opportunity moments later , although he made amends with @entity3 ’s second goal in injury - time			1
@entity0 struck when @entity37 poked the ball across to him just inside the box , guiding it with the outside of his right foot beyond a despairing @entity42 and inside the far post			2
if his celebration was a little muted , the same could not be said for @entity15 and his staff on the touchline as they sensed a fifth straight win			0
@entity30 ( right ) sealed the tie with a late goal and made up for his late penalty miss @entity52 : @entity42 6 ; @entity53 6 , @entity54 6.5 , @entity22 5.5 , @entity55 6 ( @entity56 85 ) ; @entity57 6 ; @entity58 5 ( @entity59 71 , 6 ) , @entity60 6 , @entity61 7 , @entity62 6 ; @entity63 7			1

‘ i told the players at half - time that we had three - and - a - half games left			2
the next 45 minutes could be the turning point of the season to get us over the line or it could cost us			0
‘ @entity0 is a model professional			2
i know @entity10 mean a lot to him but ultimately he ’s done his job tonight ( tuesday )			2
’ it still needed a magnificent block by @entity73 to deny @entity53 and @entity70 ’s flying save from @entity61 to preserve @entity3 ’s lead before @entity30 made sure of victory , burying his shot from 15 yards after a fine run and cutback from @entity79			1
@entity10 head coach @entity112 said : ‘ the ball was a yard out of play so it ’s a bit harsh on us			2
’ with @entity3 , @entity119 and @entity120 all winning , the pressure is now on @entity121 to do the same when they visit @entity123 on wednesday night			0
it also raises the stakes even higher when @entity3 entertain @entity120 at @entity6 on friday battling for a £ 120m ticket to the top - flight			0
@entity30 ( centre ) smashed a first half penalty against the crossbar but later spared his blushes @entity60 ( left ) attempts to tackle @entity37 during the first half in the @entity134 clash ‘ each game gets bigger and bigger , and for us and @entity120 , it wo n’t get much bigger than this game on friday night , ’ said @entity15 , who kept his players in the north to prepare for this game after they snatched an injury - time winner at @entity139 on saturday			1
‘ my mindset before the game is that we do our job , we do n’t pay attention to others			0
with all three of us winning tonight , @entity121 have got a job to do tomorrow but that ’s for them to worry about			0
‘ we ’ve worked so hard to get here			0
the games are coming thick and fast , and mentally it ’s tough			0
but we ’re well up for the challenge , this is what you ’re in football for			0
‘ looking at @entity139 and @entity10 , on paper , they were two extremely difficult games and the fact we ’ve managed to pick up six points says a huge amount about the character in the squad			2
’ @entity60 fires a free - kick into the @entity3 wall as @entity10 lost their fourth game in five in the championship			1

@entity0 scored against his old club but refused to celebrate
@entity30 missed a first half penalty when it smashed the crossbar but made up for it by sealing the tie late on at @entity2
@entity3 are closing in on automatic promotion to the @entity5
@entity10 have lost four out of their last five games in the championship
