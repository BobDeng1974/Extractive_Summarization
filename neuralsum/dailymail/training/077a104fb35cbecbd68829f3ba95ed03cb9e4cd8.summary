the family at the centre of a row over a note left to gay waitress on receipt for a meal have hit back claiming the whole episode is a hoax			2
@entity9 , a former marine , hit headlines last week when a picture of a receipt she allegedly received from a family at the @entity14 in @entity15 , saying they did n't ' agree with her lifestyle ' was posted online and went viral			1
on it she claimed the customer had written : ' sorry , i can not tip because i do not agree with your lifestyle and the way you live your life			1
' scroll down for @entity25 proof ? the controversial receipt ( left ) shows exactly the same price , time and date of the meal as the family 's copy ( right ) - but does not have the $ 18 tip the family swear they left bringing the total to $ 111.55 hoax : the family at the center of the controversy of whether or not they tipped a gay waitress at a @entity43 restaurant have denied they are bigoted and more importantly can prove they did tip the waitress confirmation : this credit card statement the family possess allegedly proves that they paid a tip and their bill came to a total of $ 111.55 as shown on their receipt and that something has gone wrong at the @entity43 restaurant bemused : @entity9 denied any impropriety at all - claiming that someone had written that note and not provided her with a tip and that the handwriting was not hers - while the father of the family denies any inference of homophobia miss @entity9 said she felt offended and upset by the comment branding the couple ' ignorant ' and received thousands of messages of support online			1
but now a @entity43 family have come forward claiming to be the customers involved and producing a receipt printed at the same time on the same date , for the same amount , except with an $ 18 tip. they contacted @entity77 after seeing news reports of miss @entity9 ' story and claim the whole thing is hoax designed to provoke reaction			1
to prove their point they also produced a @entity85 bill , which indicated their card was charged for the $ 93.55 meal plus the tip , for a total of $ 111.55			1
upset : @entity9 , pictured left while a marine and right , said she was offended and hurt by how the couple , with two small children , treated her while she served them at @entity14 in @entity93 the husband said far from being homophobic he actually refused to vote for @entity43 governor @entity95 because the governor opposes same - sex marriage			1
' never would a message like that come from us , ' he protested			0
@entity9 announced last week she would donate thousands of dollars in gratuities from supporters to the @entity103			0
but the wife countered this gesture of apparent good will saying : ' i just felt like people have a right to know that - it 's fine if people want to donate to her or to the @entity112 but they 're doing it under a false pretense			0
the restaurant reportedly could not produce the original receipt nor explain why the family was charged for the tip amount for the meal last wednesday			0
suspicious : a reporter from @entity122 @entity121 went to confront the owners of the restaurant as to why their customer was billed - including their tip - but their gay waitress received an abusive message and no tip it told the station it was aware of the couple 's claims and that an internal investigation is ongoing			2
@entity9 claimed that she felt judged by the family began as soon as she introduced herself			0
the mother , shocked by her short hair , allegedly exclaimed , ' oh , i thought you were gon na say your name is @entity141 ! you sure surprised us ! ' she sent the receipt for the meal to have a @entity145 and the @entity146 posted it online , where it garnered hundreds of supportive comments			1
in an email at the time @entity9 said she was upset she 'd served in the marines to protect such ignorant @entity152 and was concerned about the example the couple were setting for their children			2
still working : @entity9 has not been fired while an investigation is underway			0
she was also given thousands of dollars by well - wishers which she said she 'd give to the @entity161 charity ' never in a million years did i think this would happen , ' she told have a @entity164			0
' i am thoroughly offended , mad , p * * * ed off and hurt that this is what her kids will grow up learning and that i served in the @entity169 to keep ignorant people like them free			0
' sorry lady but i do n't agree with your lifestyle and the way you 're raising your kids but you did n't see me throwing that in your face and giving you shitty service			2
' @entity9 ' story was met with an outpouring of support online , with a heterosexual @entity184 user commenting , ' as a member of the heterosexual community , i beg your forgiveness for these ignorant people ' and another wrote ' i hope those parents get publicly humiliated enough to never leave their house again ! i feel sorry for their kids			1
' @entity9 later responded that it took every fiber of her being not to spit in the couple 's food , but her faith in humanity was now restored			2
' you all have put the biggest smile on my face tonight and made me realize that there are more good people in the world than bad , ' she wrote .			0

@entity9 said she was hurt by how the couple , with two small children , treated her at @entity14 in @entity15 , @entity43
she sent the receipt to have a @entity145 and @entity146 posted it online , where it garnered hundreds of supportive comments
she claims after commenting on her short hair , the mother wrote on the $ 93.55 check , ' sorry , i can not tip because i do not agree with your lifestyle and the way you live your life '
but the couple have told @entity77 that they never wrote a note and did tip her $ 18
they have branded the whole thing a hoax and say they are n't in anyway homophobic
