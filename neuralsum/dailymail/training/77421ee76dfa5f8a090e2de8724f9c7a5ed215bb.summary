a 12 - year - old boy had a lucky escape after a glass table close to his bed spontaneously exploded			1
@entity4 had just left his bedroom in @entity6 in @entity7 to go for breakfast when the table exploded , leaving thousands of sharp shards of glass embedded in the wall and door			1
the table was near the boy 's bed and next to a radiator which may have caused it to spontaneously shatter through a reaction known as ' thermal shock			2
when he heard the loud bang mr @entity4 went up to the bedroom and saw thousands of pieces of glass , most of them sharp and measuring up to half an inch , embedded in the wall and door of the room			1
' all of a sudden there was a terrific bang - like a gunshot , ' said mr @entity4			0
' we went up to have a look and there was glass everywhere			0
' the glass was still crackling like a log on a fire			0
' there was glass embedded in the door and wall			0
' mr @entity4 said a computer monitor , keyboard and printer had been placed on the table and none of the items were very heavy			2
he had bought the @entity60 table for his son about a year ago for £ 60 from @entity60 in @entity62 in @entity63 , @entity7			2
it had taken two people to lift and position the hefty piece of furniture close to a radiator in his bedroom			0
mr @entity4 said had his son been in the room he would probably have been hurt by the sharp pieces of glass ' if it had happened at night , in the dark , and my son had woken up and got out of bed without shoes on , he would have suffered cuts , ' added mr @entity4			1
it is thought the table may have exploded because of thermal shock , where temperature changes over time can cause parts of an object to expand by different amounts			2
@entity60 agreed to pay the family £ 100 in compensation			1
the family bought the table for £ 60 last year and have been offered £ 100 in compensation after it exploded a spokesman said : ' the safety of our products is always the highest priority and our entire range is tested rigorously			1
' whenever we learn of a possible fault with the design , material or manufacture , we investigate immediately and thoroughly			0
' we have already been in contact with mr @entity4 to apologise and are investigating the matter further			0
