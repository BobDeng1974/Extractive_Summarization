a teacher has been banned from the classroom after he let pupils change their exam answers invalidating his whole school 's @entity5 results			1
@entity7 asked pupils to make changes to the the national curriculum tests for 11 - year - olds , which assess @entity13 , maths and science at @entity16 in @entity17 , @entity18			1
this was despite the exam session finishing , a conduct panel heard			2
@entity7 asked pupils at @entity23 in @entity24 , pictured , to make the changes to their sats exam answers the 31 - year - old also altered a number of the pupil 's exam answers himself before the papers were sent off			1
after the suspected breach of exam rules , school officials were tipped off , resulting in an investigation being launched in june			1
the probe by the local education authority found that some pupils taking a test had changed answers outside exam conditions and that @entity7 had done the same			1
it then led to the @entity43 annulling all sats exam results for the entire school last year , the hearing was told			0
@entity7 was later forced to give up his job at the school and had since admitted the allegations and accepted it amounted to unacceptable professional conduct			2
the @entity43 annulled the whole school 's @entity52 's results after a probe by the local education authority ( file picture ) however , he insisted in a statement that he did not ask the pupils to change their answers , but to make them more legible			1
but the panel , run by the @entity62 , said that no changes of any kind should be made to exam scripts outside test conditions			1
panel chair @entity67 said , although the teacher ’s conduct had been dishonest , it fell short of fraud or serious dishonesty			0
but he added : ' whilst the panel accepts that mr @entity7 may have felt under pressure to achieve good results for himself and the school , that can in no way excuse his behaviour			2
' it is clear to the panel that he deeply regrets his conduct and the panel also considered that he was forthcoming in explaining what he had done when it was investigated by the school and local authority			0
' @entity86 , acting on behalf of education secretary @entity85 , banned @entity87 from the classroom for at least two years			2
he said : ' his actions had a serious impact on the school as their sats results were annulled for 2014			0
' mr @entity7 ’s actions were deliberate and he was not acting under duress			0
' in all the circumstances , i agree with the panel ’s recommendation that a prohibition order is an appropriate and proportionate sanction			0
' mr @entity7 has shown remorse and insight and he deeply regrets his actions			0
' he was given 28 days in which to appeal against the decision to the @entity105 .			0

@entity7 , 31 , allowed pupils to make changes outside exam conditions
he also made changes to the pupil 's work before the papers were sent off
@entity116 was launched after officials were tipped off he breached exam rules
a *disciplinary* panel has now banned @entity7 from teaching for two years
