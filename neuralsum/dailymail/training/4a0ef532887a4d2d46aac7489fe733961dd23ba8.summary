by @entity0 published : 05:17 est , 11 april 2012 updated : 19:01 est , 12 april 2012 caught out : radio presenter @entity1 has hit out over the @entity3 's move to @entity4 many @entity3 staff have never made a secret of their disdain for their new northern base			1
but one presenter has taken the sniping to a new level ... by making an on - air joke accusing the @entity14 ’s neighbours in @entity4 of being light - fingered			2
the gaffe came when @entity17 breakfast show host @entity1 was interviewing @entity20 cycling hopeful @entity18 , who won two gold medals at the @entity22 in @entity23 , about her success			1
but when miss @entity18 , 19 , joked about accidentally leaving the medals in her car , miss @entity1 quipped : ‘ what ? around here ? ’ the suggestion that the car was at risk of being broken into caused fury among radio listeners in @entity4 , who help to pay 35 - year - old miss @entity1 ’s wages through the licence fee and say the city is being unfairly reviled as a crime hotspot by @entity3 staff			1
@entity38 , a legal worker , said of tuesday ’s interview : ‘ it ’s time presenters like @entity1 kept their prejudices to themselves rather than airing them to listeners			1
she is employed to do a job , not pass snide remarks about an area which she knows little or next to nothing about			2
’ @entity48 , 29 , a clerical worker , said : ‘ it ’s just ignorance really			0
@entity4 does have a reputation as a hard city but so has @entity53 – they need to get a grip			0
’ @entity4 mp @entity56 said of @entity57 , where the @entity3 is based : ‘ i go down there on a regular basis and there ’s always a lot of activity			1
it seems like a safe place to be			0
in any urban environment you get the odd incident			0
’ this week it emerged that @entity3 managers have offered staff in @entity4 personal security guards to escort them to their cars and tram stops from their studios			1
however , crime rates for @entity76 ’s @entity75 , home to the @entity3 ’s @entity79 @entity53 headquarters , are higher than in @entity4 , and its figures for violent crime and robbery are way above the national average			1
furthermore , recent figures show that although @entity4 remains slightly above the national average for violence and robbery , crime there has dropped			0
the @entity3 ’s move to @entity91 in @entity57 – where about 1,600 staff are now based , has been riddled with gaffes and controversy , with many presenters refusing to move			1
@entity98 presenters @entity96 and @entity99 both refused to make the change and have since been replaced			1
left behind : @entity18 , centre , with her gold medal following at the @entity22 in @entity23 , @entity103 @entity105 presenter @entity104 blasted the @entity3 ’s move last year , describing @entity4 as ‘ a small suburb with a @entity108 and a canal with ducks on it ’ and said that he would resign if the motoring programme was moved north			1
miss @entity1 , a mother - of - three , last year said she was ‘ excited ’ by the prospect of a move to the @entity115 and a new base in @entity4			0
but she revealed she and her partner would not be selling their four - bedroom @entity53 home in @entity120 , valued at £ 650,000			1
‘ @entity53 prices are likely to rise faster than other parts of the country so we want to hold on to it and let it out , ’ she said			0
double winner : @entity18 with her @entity128 after winning the women 's omnium during day four of the 2012 @entity130 @entity22 in @entity23 , @entity103 she added that she was looking forward to settling in an upmarket @entity132 village with good schools and an easy commute to @entity4			0
she said : ‘ i was surprised prices in @entity132 are n’t much cheaper for a similar - sized house to our home , although the gardens are larger			0
it may not be easy to find a home that ticks every box so we are likely to rent first			0
’ a spokesman for @entity145 said : ' during a light - hearted moment at the end of the interview with @entity18 , an off - the - cuff remark was made			0
no offence was intended and we ’re sorry if anyone was upset			0
' @entity1 's remarks follow reports that a number of staff have been warned over their safety following the move to @entity4			2
corporation chiefs have offered personal security guards to escort men and women to their cars and tram stops from the studios			1
and an extraordinary email intended to reassure staff about on - site security will serve only to increase fears , with a @entity3 executive admitting she has been looking at site security ‘ following a couple of incidents ’			1
in a move costing an estimated £ 1.5billion , the @entity3 has relocated 2,500 staff across five departments including @entity177 , @entity178 to the @entity91 site			1
@entity98 made its @entity4 debut on tuesday , while @entity181 and @entity182 are among the programmes which air from the futuristic complex			0
fears : the @entity3 's £ 200m @entity91 development in @entity4			1
staff were told that it was a ' different kettle of fish ' from @entity53 incidents there over the past year include : the offer of personal security applies particularly for those working late at night or early in the morning			2
in a leaked email intended to reassure staff about on - site safety , @entity199 , head of development for @entity178 and @entity202 , said the measures had been tightened after incidents affecting staff			2
‘ i ’ve been looking at on - site security on 5 @entity17 ’s behalf following a couple of incidents – and also the reality that @entity91 is a different kettle of fish to @entity211			0
’ the @entity3 ’s buildings at @entity79 have private car parks manned by security and which require a pass to enter , while the tube station is yards away			1
concerned : @entity199 , left , head of development for @entity218 5 live and @entity202 , said @entity4 was a ' different kettle of fish ' to west @entity53 and there has been an offer of personal security for those working late by contrast , the @entity57 area has open access as a number of businesses operate in the area and is relatively deserted after normal working hours			0
the site is patrolled by security guards on foot and on segway electric two - wheeled vehicles			2
in the same email , @entity236 , the head of security for @entity238 – which owns and polices the site – said he could ‘ arrange for escorts ’ for frightened staff			2
mr @entity236 also reassured staff that the site had 300 cctv cameras , guards on constant patrol and a 24 - hour control room			1
in spite of these precautions , however , a wide range of crimes were reported by @entity3 employees since last year including assault , spray - paint damage and thefts			1
@entity255 , head of communications for @entity238 , said that the @entity4 complex includes more than 50 commercial businesses – including @entity259 , @entity260 and @entity261 – and 378 apartments			2
he said : ‘ from day one our policy has been to , on request , offer escorts to people who want to get to their cars or the tram stop , particularly late at night			1
’ the crime rate has dropped in @entity4 in recent years but remains slightly above the national average for violent crime and robbery			0
upping sticks : @entity275 and @entity276 present @entity98 , just one of the programmes that has been forced to relocate to the north leafy : @entity281 in @entity79 , west @entity53 , where staff had previously been based before the move to @entity4 last year a student staying at a hotel in @entity57 was shot dead in what police described as an ‘ unprovoked attack ’			2
however , crime rates for the @entity76 ’s @entity75 area around @entity79 are higher than @entity4 and its figures for violent crime and robbery are well above the national average			0
@entity295 , leader of @entity296 , yesterday pointed out that crime was not unique to the city			0
‘ this is just scaremongering , ’ he said			0
‘ it is not unusual for complexes like @entity301 to have high levels of security , whether in @entity4 , @entity53 or any other city			0
’ @entity98 presenters @entity276 and @entity275 were teased yesterday over their move to @entity4			2
@entity307 , of the @entity308 , said : ‘ i only live four minutes away ... great to have you on in the @entity115			0
’ when @entity307 started asking @entity275 where exactly in @entity132 he would be living , the presenter replied : ‘ careful ’ , acknowledging that the travel and residential arrangements of @entity3 broadcasters in the @entity115 are intended to be kept off screen			1
@entity275 then joked : ‘ all back to @entity307 ’s for some breakfast – he ’s closest ! ’			2
