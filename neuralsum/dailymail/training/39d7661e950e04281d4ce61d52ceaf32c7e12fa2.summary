by the time @entity1 has finished you do wonder if there will be any meaningful record left in @entity4 that does n’t have his name attached			1
the bar appeared to have been set forbiddingly high with sir @entity9 ’s six majors and @entity11 ’s remarkable tally of eight @entity12 , but the @entity13 is now so far ahead of the game even these storied records will surely not survive the passage of time			0
@entity9 and @entity18 were both 30 years old when they first started on their twin pillars of achievement			2
@entity1 has sealed another race to @entity24 victory with the season 's climax still to come the world no 1 has earned more than twice as many points as his closest competitors on the tour at just 25 , @entity1 is two - thirds of the way to @entity9 ’s total and on sunday was formally declared the winner of the race to @entity24 for the second time in three years			1
the latter is the modern - day equivalent of the @entity12 but might also have to be renamed if @entity1 keeps winning it before the race ever gets within view of the @entity40			1
with more than twice as many points as the man in second place , @entity1 actually lapped the field despite not playing for the past six weeks and there ’s no reason to think this will not happen again and again over the next decade , just as it did in @entity48 with @entity49			1
one smidgeon of hope for the rest might be if he concentrates on the @entity53 but his schedule this year suggests the opposite will be the case			2
@entity11 ( left ) and @entity9 had set the bar high , but @entity1 looks set to rise to the challenge look at what happened			1
after a year ’s absence , @entity1 played in the @entity61 in february and admitted it had been a mistake leaving it off his list			1
in may , his previous ambivalence towards the @entity66 at @entity67 was dismissed with a series of statements where he declared it is the event all @entity4 should compete in			1
the @entity71 is now run by his own charitable trust , while the @entity73 can surely look forward to @entity1 ’s support for the foreseeable future after this year ’s event proved such a valuable dry run for his victory at @entity79 the following week			1
he also turned up at the @entity80 in @entity81 in october			0
if he continues at this rate @entity1 could dominate @entity4 the way @entity49 did in @entity48 one criticism of the race to @entity24 is that you can win it almost without setting foot in @entity4 , given winnings from the @entity48 majors and @entity92 events all count			1
well , @entity1 not only won more money than anyone else on the @entity97 ’s international schedule , he also won more than anyone else if you just counted events in @entity4			1
i ’m told it might be nine months before we know the name of @entity106 ’s successor as the tour ’s chief executive			0
whoever it proves to be , what a stroke of fortune to have a world no 1 on board who is both fully committed to playing his part and set to dominate for years to come			1
@entity118 closes in on rookie prize it took 49 years for an @entity48 to win the sir @entity124 award on the @entity97			2
now , following @entity127 ’s success last year , it appears almost certain his great friend @entity118 will become the 50th			2
@entity118 is almost certain to become the second @entity48 in two years to be @entity130 @entity118 ’s victory over @entity132 at the @entity133 on sunday was the most rewarding part yet of their wonderful three - year road trip			1
forsaking the chance to establish themselves in their homeland , the two great buddies set out in 2012 to see the world and earn their playing privileges far away from home			2
they started out on the @entity144 and have graduated so spectacularly they ’re now claiming prestigious prizes on the main circuit			0
@entity118 played brilliantly to beat @entity132 to last week 's @entity133 in @entity147 in particular , 24 - year - old @entity118 ( left ) looks ready to add his name to the crop of driven young @entity48 who are going to make the next @entity151 an awful lot closer than the last one			2
quote of the week ‘ the last psychiatrist i spoke to recommended taking up golf to relieve stress — and that ’s a bad idea			0
@entity158 ’s more stressful than combat			0
’ it might sound like a bad joke from a second - rate comic but the eye - catching remarks actually belong to @entity165 , the @entity166 who shot dead @entity168			0
he was speaking to the @entity170			0
on @entity175 ’s own website , the par - four ninth on the @entity173 course is described as a spectacular par four but it ’s clearly not enough for @entity177 , who recently bought the @entity79 venue on the @entity180 coast			0
@entity177 wants to make the picturesque course even more spectacular by tranforming the ninth hole the tycoon has declared his intention to turn it into a breathtaking par three			0
to be fair , from the back tee over the rocks to a green perched just the other side , with the fabled lighthouse adjacent , you can see what he is envisaging			0
his hopes are naturally understated			0
‘ it will be the most spectacular short hole in the world , ’ he said .			0

@entity1 has sealed his second race to @entity24 in three years
@entity1 is on the way to becoming @entity4 's greatest ever player
