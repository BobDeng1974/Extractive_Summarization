@entity0 took pot - shots at president @entity2 – and at his own @entity4 party – on thursday during a speech to a conservative family - valies group in @entity7 in his remarks to the @entity12 , the anti-abortion , anti-gay marraige @entity9 governor blasted his fellow @entity14 , without naming them , for being ' cheaper democrats			1
' @entity0 is on a tear this year , castigating proponents of ' @entity18 , ' the @entity2 administration 's plan to nationalize education standards and take control away from local governments			1
some moderate @entity4 , most notably former @entity25 gov. @entity24 , have embraced the plan			1
@entity24 , now a 2016 front - runner , faces a difficult road ahead convincing social conservatives that he 's right			1
@entity9 gov. @entity0 is road - testing a laundry list of rock - ribbed conservative positions in advance of deciding whether to run for president , but his passion is battling ' @entity18 ' federal education standards ' @entity37 ' : @entity0 bashed moderate republicans with swipes that seemed aimed at former @entity25 gov. @entity24 ' @entity41 of the federal government into every corner of our lives , ' @entity0 said thursday to applause , also railing against the @entity49 insurance system and ' government elites			1
' ' i have more faith in the moms than i do in any collection of bureaucrats , ' he said			0
' they think they know better than you			0
they think you 're not smart enough to educate your children			0
' he could ride the @entity18 issue far into the 2016 primary season , hitting @entity24 over the head with it at every turn			1
but is he in the race ? ' look , we 're thinking about it			0
we 're taking a serious look at it , ' @entity0 told @entity74 during a post-speech press conference in which @entity4 and president @entity2 took turns as his punching bag			1
' my wife and i are praying about it			0
we 'll make that decision in the next couple of months			2
' if he ran , he said , his campaign ' would be about standing up to the left			0
' @entity0 reserved harsher words for @entity4 , baiting them in a way that seemed to forehadow the 2016 presidential primary race			1
@entity90 , he said , do n't want ' for us to be cheaper , paler versions , weaker versions of the other party			1
' ' if all we are is cheaper democrats , if all we are are @entity95 - lite , we do n't deserve to be the governing party			1
we do n't deserve to win the election			2
we do n't deserve to have a majority in the @entity100 or the @entity101			0
' ' if this election was all about getting bigger and better office space for @entity105 and for senator @entity106 , let 's give the office space back , ' he blasted			1
no compromise : @entity0 insists that @entity90 will vote for an ' authentic ' conservative ' @entity111 ' : @entity113 @entity112 sen. @entity112 would attract slings and arrows from @entity0 if he entered the 2016 @entity101 contest because of his obama-esque views on immigration @entity0 drew lines of comparison between the @entity121 and some republicans who have softened their opposition to the @entity49 over time			1
' you need to repeal and replace the entire thing ( but ) that 's not what many @entity4 are saying here in @entity7 ' he said			1
' they say , " oh , no , there 's a new baseline			2
that means that if we just replace some of the taxes , or some of the spending , that 's progress "			2
' ' that 's nonsense , ' @entity0 nearly barked in mid-crescendo			0
' when they were campaigning , they talked about repealing and replacing all of @entity49			0
' @entity0 favors scrapping the system and replacing it with standardized income tax deductions that would permit @entity90 to spend money on whatever insurance plan they chose , and would possibly lower prices across the board by letting @entity90 buy policies issued in any of the 49 states where they do n't live			0
@entity121 have opposed those measures since the 1990s days of @entity152 , am even more sweeping overhaul than @entity49 , which was proposed by then - first lady @entity154			1
@entity155 : @entity0 says @entity4 who ran with promises that they would repeal the @entity49 need to follow through , lest they become a ' second liberal party ' ' i think we 've had enough of on - the - job training with our current president , ' @entity0 said of @entity2 @entity0 fears that the @entity49 will calcify in place , and that the @entity4 will go along – virtually erasing the policy differences between @entity4 and @entity121			1
' we do n't need two liberal parties , ' he told @entity74 during a q&a			0
. ' we have $ 18 trillion of debt			0
we have @entity49 interfering with the relationships between patients and doctors			0
we 've got a middle class suffering in his economy , ' @entity0 exclaimed			0
' we need in the @entity4 leaders who have the courage , the honesty to tell us the truth , to stand up to the left			2
' ' i think we 've had enough of on - the - job training with our current president , ' he said later			2
' let 's elect someone who 's actually balanced a budget and run a state government			2
' that 's a massive hint that he has a bias toward governors , rather than members of the @entity190 , winning the @entity101			0
' the advantage of having a governor is that they 've got a track record , ' @entity0 said , analyzing gov. @entity24 's chances next year			1
' they 've had to govern with results , ' @entity0 said			0
' this president , ' on the other hand , ' gave some good speeches , and that 's all he 's given			2

@entity9 governor says he 's considering a run for president
seemed to be bashing @entity24 and other moderate republicans who have embraced @entity18 education standards and other policies that make the tea party *furious*
without naming @entity24 , he lashed out at @entity4 who are ' cheaper @entity121 ' and ' @entity95 - lite '
' if this election was all about getting bigger and better office space for @entity105 and for senator @entity106 , let 's give the office space back '
