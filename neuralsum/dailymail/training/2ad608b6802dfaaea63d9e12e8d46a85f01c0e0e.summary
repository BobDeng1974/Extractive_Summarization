their damning report accused the marriages – often between ‘ away - day brides ’ from @entity17 and men from outside the @entity19 – of making a ‘ mockery ’ of our legal system			0
officials are called in over bogus wedding ceremonies near four times a day , reveals a new report ( file picture ) and it said the @entity8 is hopelessly unaware of the ‘ alarming ’ scale of the scandal , which represents a ‘ significant threat ’ to immigration control			0
it is thought that as many as 10,000 out of 173,000 civil weddings each year in @entity35 and @entity36 are fake			1
a sham marriage does not just allow a @entity40 national the right to stay in @entity3 , but also their children , grandchildren , parents and grandparents – piling extra pressure on public services			1

the number arrested for taking part in a fake union more than tripled from 221 to 725 over the same period			1
but remarkably , an ‘ absurd ’ legal loophole means that two people living in the @entity3 can be married by proxy , without any ceremony actually taking place in this country			2
this means they can technically get married without leaving the @entity3 , as long as they are ‘ represented ’ at their overseas wedding ceremony , usually by a family member			2
warning that the situation was ‘ spiralling out of control , ’ committee chairman @entity65 , a @entity66 mp , said : ‘ there is an industry of deceit in the @entity3 which uses sham marriages to circumvent immigration control			1

we can not afford for any town or city to become a back - door entry to our country			0
’ last year immigration officials carried out 1,338 raids connected to sham marriages in the @entity3 he added : ‘ it is absurd that we accept marriages where the two parties do not attend the ceremony			1
this allows an easy ticket into the @entity3			2
this proxy marriage loophole must be closed immediately			2
’ sham marriages are increasingly popular among immigrants because anyone who enters a bogus relationship successfully can use it to stay in @entity3 for five years and eventually obtain citizenship			1
under @entity101 rules , they can then apply for permission to bring in their extended family			0
officials have found a growing number of @entity17 women are being paid to visit @entity3 for a few days and supposedly marry a man , then return alone to their home countries			2
their fake husbands are mainly from @entity111 , @entity112 , @entity113 and @entity114			0
the report calls on home secretary @entity116 to start routinely publishing figures on the number of sham marriage reports , interventions , arrests , prosecutions and eventual deportations			1
it also suggests that the @entity8 should write to the embassies of @entity17 nationals commonly involved in sham marriages , warning them that it could lead to a criminal record and being booted out of @entity3			1
the report demands beefed - up enforcement teams and more efforts to encourage reporting of suspected sham marriages			0
and it urges the @entity8 to give registrars extra training so that they are better qualified to recognise scams , as well as giving them more power to stop marriages they believe are suspicious			0
a @entity8 spokesman said : ‘ we are taking ever tougher action , including through the new @entity145 , to crack down on those who try to cheat our immigration system by abusing marriage laws			0
’ but sir @entity149 , of @entity150 , said : ‘ @entity151 marriages are a huge cost to the taxpayer			0
this is a very serious loophole in our immigration controls and must be part of our renegotiations with the @entity19			0

@entity160 , who comes from @entity161 , wed 29 - year - old @entity163 national @entity162 in @entity164 in 2009 to get the right to live in the @entity3			1
he was paid to join in with the pretence			0
photographs seized by investigators showed the pair smiling together and looking every inch the happy couple after the ceremony			0
