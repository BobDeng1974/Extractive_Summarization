by @entity0 for @entity1 every day , thousands of people are joining are uploading videos of their attempt at the ice bucket challenge to join the social media craze			0
but with so many clips dominating @entity8 feeds , users are thinking of ways to stand out			0
so when mechanic @entity13 received his nomination , he decided to ditch the ice - and instead opted for engine oil			1
within hours of thinking up the idea in the pub , mr @entity13 and his colleagues at @entity37 in @entity23 had already raised more than £ 1,000			1
garage owner @entity40 said : ' we were in the pub talking about the craze and @entity13 made a throwaway comment that he 'd do it with car oil			1
' i said to him ' i 'll give you £ 300 if you do it ' and he said he would , as long as the money goes to @entity26			2
' his mum @entity50 passed away earlier this year after a long - term battle with cancer so he wanted to raise money for that cause			2
' we already had £ 700 by the time we left the first pub , @entity56 in @entity57 , as there was an 18th birthday party in the back room			2
soaked : mr @entity13 jokingly said he would use engine oil instead of ice at the pub , with his friends jumping on the idea			1
within hours they had already raised more than £ 1,000 ' on the same night we moved on to the @entity68 in @entity69 , the @entity70 in @entity71 and the @entity72 in @entity19			1
by the time we got home we 'd already raised £ 1,100 in sponsorship			1
' the total amount raised has now topped £ 1,200 and representatives from @entity77 will be visiting the garage on monday to collect the cash			0
mr @entity40 added : ' the sponsorship support was phenomenal , everyone wanted to donate			0
@entity13 spends most of the day covered in oil anyway so it was n't that different for him after the challenge			2
' he took it in good spirits and was back in the pub again within the hour			0
he 's chuffed to have raised that much money			0
' we are so grateful for the support and would particularly like to thank @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 and @entity94			0

@entity13 , from @entity19 , @entity20 , had 30 litres of oil poured on him
co-workers covered the 46 - year - old at @entity22 , @entity23
his colleagues agreed they would all donate in memory of his late mother
within hours he had raised more than £ 1,000 for @entity26
