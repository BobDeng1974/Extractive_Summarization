@entity22 : hackers targeting a @entity25 - enabled road sign in downtown @entity12 managed to change a message warning of possible traffic delays to say ' read a f * * * * * * book ' instead a spokesman for @entity31 , which is in charge of the sign , confirmed that it had been hacked and had its initial message about possible journey delays changed			1
the spokesman said it is possible to connect to the sign over @entity25 , so the hacker could have been using a laptop or smartphone to change the message			1
a second sign further down the road was also changed to carry the same offensive message but she added that it was also possible to walk up to the sign and change the message manually			1
journalist @entity50 , who initially tweeted an image of the sign , confirmed that another one a few blocks away had also had its message changed			1
however the offensive message has now been cleared from both of the signs			2
hackers have been hitting the headlines recently after a series of high - profile attacks hit corporations and government agencies			2
@entity1 had a set of confidential employee details and embarrassing email exchanges between senior staff leaked in the run - up to @entity70			2
the hack , which means @entity73 's network is still out of action , was though to be carried out by cyber-spies working for @entity76			2
the movie - house was in the midst of launching @entity79 , a film depicting the assassination of dictator @entity81 , when the attack took place			0
on christmas day @entity1 was targeted again , along with @entity84 , by a group known as the @entity86 , who knocked the @entity89 and @entity3 online networks down for several days			0
the anonymous group brought the systems down just as millions of gamers were trying to play on the new consoles they had just been bought for @entity70			0
