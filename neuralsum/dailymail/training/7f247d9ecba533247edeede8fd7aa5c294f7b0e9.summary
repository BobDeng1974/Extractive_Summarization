@entity1 boss @entity0 has labelled reports linking him with the @entity5 manager 's job as ' disrespectful ' to current incumbent @entity6			1
the pressure cranked up a notch on the under - fire @entity10 chief on saturday as his team were humbled 4 - 0 by former club @entity12 , prompting the 53 - year - old to skip the post-match press conference at @entity16 's			2
but @entity0 , all too familiar with managerial life in the north - east after an ill - fated stint at @entity20 from 2009 to 2011 , said talk of him taking over at @entity22 was out of order			1
@entity0 has backed up under - fire @entity5 boss @entity6 after he was linked with the @entity25 job @entity6 looks on as his @entity5 side are thumped against @entity12 on saturday @entity6 looks down after seeing his @entity5 side get thumped at @entity12 on saturday he told @entity29 's @entity28 programme : ' it is n't nice - it 's a horrible sunday morning for him and i find it very , very disrespectful that i 'm linked with somebody else 's job when he 's still in a job			1
' it 's a hard enough job we 've all got			0
we all know what it 's like now in football management			0
' that part of the game will never change , but for me at the moment i 'm just concentrating on the game against @entity45 ( on monday night ) and leaving all that aside			0
' @entity0 , who guided the @entity47 to their first @entity49 final last term , added : ' after what happened to me at @entity20 , it 's similar to what @entity6 is going through now			1
i know how difficult the north - east is			1
' i 've been here for a couple of years			0
@entity1 gave me that chance to get back up and running again and for that i 'll always be grateful			2
' i 've only been here a couple of years , and we 've had a really good couple of years			0
' the match at @entity16 's could scarcely have gone worse for @entity6 , whose side looked extremely vulnerable in defence			2
@entity5 fans vent out their frustration towards @entity6 following their defeat against @entity12 @entity5 fans make their feelings clear on @entity6 ahead of the game at @entity16 's on saturday fans held up a ' @entity68 ' banner in the away section of the ground , with club owner @entity71 attending the match in person			1
@entity6 told @entity74 on saturday : '' it is not easy to digest and not easy for the players either to play under those circumstances , so we have to be strong and try and tough it out this week and come back next week			0
' we just have to put ourselves on the line , really , and be brave			0
certainly , we have a bit more quality than we showed today , for sure , and we need to get that on the pitch			0
' @entity6 famously signed an eight - year contract with @entity5 just under two years ago , having led the @entity10 to fifth place in the 2011 - 12 season			1
the club 's fortunes have waned significantly since then however , and @entity6 's position came under great scrutiny in march when he headbutted @entity1 's @entity92			1
@entity5 fined him Â£ 100,000 and gave him a formal warning over that incident , while the @entity96 handed down a seven - match touchline ban .			2

the @entity1 manager says the reports linking him with the @entity5 job is *unfair* on under fire @entity25 boss @entity6
@entity0 is the *favourite* to take over at @entity106 if @entity6 is given the boot
@entity0 has been heavily linked with the north - east club in the past
@entity5 *remained* *rooted* to the bottom of the @entity112 after taking just two points from their first four games
