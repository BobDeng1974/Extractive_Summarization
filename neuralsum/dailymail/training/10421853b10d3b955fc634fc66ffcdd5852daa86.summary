but when it was @entity17 's turn to step up , the 40 - year - old failed to offer a hand to the @entity2 , clutching them close to his chest			1
@entity2 appeared to have been briefed on the situation , because she did not offer her hand either			0
the incident threatened to overshadow a glittering night for @entity42 , which enjoyed its most successful day of the @entity43 so far with seven gold medals			0
the @entity1 delegation in @entity46 have not been available to comment on the incident , but according to the @entity49 , they have told games organisers @entity17 was not making a political statement			1
it 's believed the athlete was merely conforming to @entity1 cultural convention , forbidding men from shaking hands with unrelated women			1
a spokesman for @entity28 has revealed the @entity2 was briefed beforehand and warned not to offer her hand to @entity17			1
presentation : @entity2 hands over the medal , left , and @entity17 claps his hands to his chest , right end of the presentation : @entity2 of @entity4 moves away from the athlete the @entity66 rules about touching apply to @entity67 and non-muslims			1

' many male athletes from @entity66 countries do not shake hands in public with women they are not related to for cultural and religious reasons , ' the palace representative said			1
the palace added @entity24 was ' honoured ' to get the chance to present the medals , particularly to a @entity93 champion in @entity9			1
it put @entity11 in second place in the medal table , with 54 in all			2
the @entity1 have said that had the medal been presented by a man @entity17 would have shaken his hand			1
likewise , had the @entity2 presented the medal to a female @entity1 they would not have hesitated to shake hands			1
however , it 's not the first time the @entity1 custom has caused controversy			2
last year the @entity1 volleyball team had to apologise after several team members shook hands with a female referee after a game against @entity113			1
the gesture provoked outrage and @entity1 ’s state - owned media described the players ' behaviour as ' stunning and inappropriate '			2
beaming : @entity2 of @entity4 smiles as she hands the gold medal to @entity9 of @entity11 shaking hands : the pair have no such issues as @entity9 enjoys his moment of glory podium : @entity17 poses with gold medallist @entity9 and third placed @entity12 of @entity13 earlier on sunday , @entity24 cheered with delight as @entity93 's mixed coxed fours crew - @entity128 , @entity129 , @entity130 , @entity131 and cox @entity132 - pulled away from their @entity134 rivals and crossed the finish line first at @entity137			1

@entity153 stayed away in apparent protest as the gold she had been presented with on friday was awarded to @entity13 's @entity165			0
the 23 - year - old was demoted to silver and the place on the podium reserved for the second - placed athlete remained empty			0
