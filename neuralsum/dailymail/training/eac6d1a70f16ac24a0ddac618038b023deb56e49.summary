by @entity1 reporter a woman began to scream hysterically on an @entity4 flight bound for @entity5 screaming ' @entity6 your my saviour ! ' in a video posted to @entity11 , the woman who was traveling from @entity13 to @entity5 repeatedly screamed over and over leaving passengers around her deeply unsettled			1
as she shouts , ' @entity6 , you ’re my savior ! @entity6 , you ’re my savior ! ' she flips through a magazine with one hand and taps restlessly on her cellphone with the other			1
initially she asked people sitting nearby to pray for her because her mother who had recently died - then the yelling began			1
although flight attendants did n't restrain the woman , they did ask passengers to intervene if she headed towards the back of the plane and attempt to open the doors			1
get me out of here : the woman in the aisle seat ca n't get off the plane fast enough the video , uploaded to @entity11 last october , has had well over 690,000 views , and shows the woman going crazy as the plane lands in @entity5			1
shot by @entity56 , the video shows the man sitting next to the hysterical woman trying to calm her down			2
his failure to calm her elicits an exasperated shrug of the shoulders			0
‘ she ’s been freaking out for the last 20 minutes , ’ mr @entity56 explains over the shouting woman			0
‘ she started off by telling everyone to pray for her mother who just passed away			0
‘ she went up and down the aisles telling everyone to pray for her mother , ’ mr @entity56 further explains as the woman ’s tirade shows no signs of slowing down			2
‘ ' the flight attendant has asked me that if she tries to head to the back door of the plane , i 'm to block her			2
' a man in the seat next to her appeared to be trying to calm her down , patting her arm and attempting to soothe her			0
‘ i do n’t know if this guy next to her knows her or not , ’ mr @entity56 further narrates over the unending barrage of proclamation , ‘ but he ’s been trying to calm her down the whole time			0
’ other jittery travelers stared into space and tried not to pay attention to the woman			0
the man ’s efforts to calm the woman finally incense her , as she points and yells ‘ do n’t f * * king touch me ’ at him before repeating her mantra and apologizing to @entity6 for cursing			1
she then goes right back into repeating ‘ @entity6 you ’re my savior and fast and loud as she can			1
clearly distraught : the crazed woman asked passengers to pray for her recently deceased mother before launching into her repetitious rant eventually , she appears to run out of steam , finally quieting down , mr @entity56 explains the flight attendant asked him to make sure the woman does n’t make a run for the plane ’s door			1
‘ if she tries to go back , we ’re going to block her , ’ mr @entity56 said as the woman ’s meltdown caught a second wind			2
though not as loud and fast as before , the mantra is repeated over and over			0
it is not clear what the woman ’s ultimate fate was , she has not been publicly identified			0
then , like a voice from the heavens , an automated message advised passengers to ‘ remain in their seats ’ until the aircraft arrived at its gate			0
