by @entity0 published : 06:10 est , 28 august 2013 updated : 06:14 est , 28 august 2013 a man who reached out to cuddle his girlfriend in bed was shocked to wake up and find he was holding a fox in his arms			1
@entity6 , who works from his suburban home , was enjoying a lie - in after his partner got up and went to work without him knowing he felt a furry creature climb into the bed and nuzzle into his neck - and assumed it was the couple 's cat @entity14			1
but when he turned around to give his girlfriend a hug he realised the animal had coarse hair - and he opened his eyes to see he was holding a fox			1
couple : @entity6 and @entity23 were terrified when an urban fox entered their home intruder : it consultant mr @entity6 managed to snap a photo of the animal before it ran away the fox had apparently entered the house in @entity33 , @entity34 through the catflap ahead of the incident on august 7			1
mr @entity6 , 30 , quickly whipped out his phone to capture photographic evidence of the intruder - but then man and fox entered a 10 - minute stand - off			1
the vermin only ran off after the it consultant charged at it shouting			2
' i just thought it was the cat , so i thought nothing of it , ' mr @entity6 said			2
' it had walked up my back and was licking my neck for a good couple of seconds			0
' i pushed him off and rolled over for a cuddle , forgetting @entity23 was already at work			1
fear : ms @entity23 is worried the vermin will return to the couple 's home in @entity33 , @entity34 mistaken identity : mr @entity6 initially assumed the animal nuzzling him was the couple 's pet cat @entity14 ' when i touched what i thought was the cat , it was all rough and not like @entity14 at all			1
' i could n't believe it			0
it was so calm - it just stared at me			2
then it went to the end of the bed and that 's when i grabbed my phone to take the picture			0
' it went to the door and just sat in the doorway , still staring			0
' the animal was apparently not looking for food , as it walked past the kitchen on its way up two flights of stairs to the second - floor flat			2
his partner @entity23 , who was commuting to her job at a transport company at the time of the incident , initially laughed when she saw the photo of the fox - but now she is worried it will return			1
bedroom : the it consultant reached out to hug his partner , not realising she had left for work , and found himself holding the fox instead gaining entry : the fox apparently got in to the house through the catflap and then ran up the stairs ' when i saw the fox i thought it was hilarious at first , ' the 28 - year - old said			1
' i thought , " @entity108 serves you right for laying in bed			0
" ' but then i put the picture on @entity112 and a lot of my friends said they would have been terrified			0
' if it had got into bed with me , i do n't know what i would have done - maybe hide under the covers and scream and cry			2
' i 'm really scared now that it will come back , i 'm really jumpy			0
i am really paranoid when i am alone in the house that it will come and get me			0
an @entity123 spokesman said : ' foxes by nature will tend to avoid human contact and incidents such as these are rare			0
' we would encourage people to use humane deterrents to discourage foxes from their gardens , the most effective of which is removing or preventing access to what attracts them - for example food			0
