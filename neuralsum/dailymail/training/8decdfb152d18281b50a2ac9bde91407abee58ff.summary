patients who smoke or are very obese are being denied routine operations by cost - cutting @entity3 managers			1
bosses in @entity5 , @entity6 and @entity7 said the measures are ‘ urgent and necessary ’ to help recover a £ 14.5 million debt			1
under a policy to be introduced this month , morbidly obese patients will have to lose a certain amount of weight before they will be put forward for any non-urgent operations			1
the restrictions will apply to patients requiring non-urgent operations and are ‘ urgent and necessary ’ to help recover a £ 14.5 million debt , say hospital bosses in @entity20 these patients have a body mass index of 40 or higher which is equivalent to a 6ft man weighing just over 20 stone			1
the @entity25 – which covers a population of 900,000 – has yet to decide how much weight they must lose but it could be several stone to bring them down into the ‘ obese ’ or ‘ overweight ’ range			1
similarly , it is demanding that smokers give up for at least six weeks before being put on the waiting list for all non-urgent surgery			1
but experts accused managers of ‘ prescriptively ’ rationing vital treatment from patients just because of their lifestyle choices			0
@entity39 , of the @entity40 , pointed out that operations such as hip and knee replacements would be hugely beneficial for the obese in helping them exercise			1
‘ this is a prescriptive and cost - cutting measure			0
’ ‘ such operations would be hugely cost effective in the long term and highly beneficial for patients			2
‘ it ’s just rationing			0
’ the organisation said it had no choice and needed to ensure there was enough money to care for patients during the busy winter months			2
but it is not the first time managers have resorted to such arbitrary measures to cut costs			0
smokers will have to give up for at least six weeks before being put on the waiting list in 2012 it emerged that a quarter of trusts were restricting at least one procedures from the obese or smokers – although in most cases it was ivf			1
at the time , managers pointed out that surgery can be riskier and less effective for patients who are very overweight or who smoke			0

hip and knee replacements tend to be less successful in the obese and there is also evidence they benefit less from @entity69			0

they will have to meet certain criteria before being eligible which might include a certain amount of sight loss or having restricted movement			0
patients who have a body mass index of 40 or higher - which is equivalent to a 6ft man weighing just over 20 stone - will be targeted @entity103 , the @entity25 ’s chief officer , said : ‘ we must act to protect essential services through our busiest winter months and ensure that care is there for our patients when they really need it , ” she said			1
‘ the @entity25 has already begun to implement a series of measures designed to improve efficiency in the system and encourage patients to contribute to improving their own health outcomes			2
‘ these measures bring the @entity25 into line with similar organisations in the @entity3			0
