by @entity0 @entity2 star @entity1 has come to his homophobic father 's defense in an impassioned speech , branding him a ' @entity7 prophet ' who is being punished for speaking ' truths '			1
following in the footsteps of his father 's religious rants , @entity1 , the oldest son of @entity9 , made the comments in an address at the @entity15 on the @entity17 conference in @entity18 last week			1
he explained that the outcry at his father 's december interview in @entity19 - in which he likened homosexuality to bestiality - had not changed his views			1
' it has n't changed us one bit , who we are , what we believe and what we teach other people			0
and it wo n't , ' he told the audience in a video of the speech			0
' my dad , @entity9 , has the heart and the mindset of a prophet … long hair , long beard , naturally camouflaged , he ate off the land and he pointed people to @entity59 , ' @entity1 said , @entity49 first reported			1
' [ @entity60 ] also lost his head for speaking the truth in a culture that really was n’t prepared to hear truth			0
' and yet , you know what - that does n't change dad 's view at all			1
prophets tend to not care about their public image , they tend to talk about judgment as if it ’s real and they speak what @entity74 gives them to speak and that 's what my dad does			1
he is in that sense a @entity7 prophet			2
' in hot water : @entity1 , 68 , was briefly suspended from @entity2 last december following an interview @entity1 was a pastor for two decades before he went back into the family business making duck calls			1
he and his wife @entity86 joined his parents and siblings on @entity2 last year			2
@entity1 despite @entity89 briefly dropping @entity9 from the show after the scandal in december , he has not kept quiet about his homophobic views			1
just last month , he was filmed giving an @entity94 sermon at @entity95 in his hometown of @entity97 , @entity98 on april 20 , according to a video on @entity100			1
in the footage , the 68 - year - old expresses his anger at the outcry over his december interview			1
' they were mad at me , ' he tells the congregation in the video			0
' you say , " why 'd they get mad at you ? " @entity113 instead of acknowledging their sin , like you had better do , they railed against me for giving them the truth about their sins			0
' rant : in an @entity94 sermon at his @entity98 church , @entity2 patriarch @entity9 complained about the outrage against him following his homophobic comments last year it emerged just five months after @entity1 , a born - again @entity127 , gave the controversial @entity19 interview			1
' everything is blurred on what ’s right and what 's wrong			2
sin becomes fine , ' he said in the interview			2
' start with homosexual behavior and just morph out from there			0
' @entity136 , sleeping around with this woman and that woman and that woman and those men ... neither the adulterers , the idolaters , the male prostitutes , the homosexual offenders , the greedy , the drunkards , the slanderers , the swindlers - they wo n't inherit the kingdom of @entity74			0
' his homophobic comments also included such insights as : ' it seems like , to me , a vagina - as a man - would be more desirable than a man 's anus			1
' that 's just me			2
i ’m just thinking : there ’s more there ! she 's got more to offer			2
i mean , come on , dudes ! you know what i 'm saying ? but hey , sin : it 's not logical , my man			2
it 's just not logical			0
' on the show : @entity1 , a former pastor , is pictured renewing his parents ' vows in season four of @entity2 family : @entity1 is the only non-bearded member of the @entity9 family , who made their millions from duck calls he also grouped homosexuals with terrorists , saying , ' we never , ever judge someone on who 's going to heaven , hell			1
that 's the @entity185 's job			0
we just love ' em , give ' em the good news about @entity187 - whether they 're homosexuals , drunks , terrorists			0
we let @entity74 sort ' em out later , you see what i 'm saying ? ' after the interview emerged , @entity1 was put on indefinite hiatus from @entity2			1
while his removal was lauded by gay rights organizations , fans of the show denounced it as a violation of his right to free speech			0
conservative supporters included @entity205 , who wrote in a @entity207 post : ' free speech is an endangered species			0
those intolerants ' hatin ' and taking on the @entity2 patriarch for voicing his personal opinion are taking on all of us			0
' @entity89 initially said his views were ' disappointing ' but two weeks later , they announced that @entity1 would be included when they began filming again in the new year			1
uncertain future : @entity2 ( the cast is pictured ) has seen lower ratings since the tirade last year ' after discussions with the @entity1 family , as well as consulting with numerous advocacy groups , @entity89 has decided to resume filming @entity2 later this spring with the entire @entity1 family , ' the network said in a statement			1
@entity1 also released a public apology saying , in part : ' i would never treat anyone with disrespect just because they are different from me			2
' we are all created by the @entity185 and like @entity232 , i love all of humanity			0
we would all be better off if we loved @entity74 and loved each other			0
' whether or not this latest rant will affect his position on the show - which has suffered falling ratings since the first tirade - has yet to be seen			0
the show is scheduled to begin its sixth season on june 11			0

@entity1 , a former pastor , spoke in @entity18 last week and said outcry at his dad 's homophobic comments had not affected his views
