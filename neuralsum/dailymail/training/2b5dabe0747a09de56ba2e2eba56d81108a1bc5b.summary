a woman has overcome a five - year battle with depression which saw her sectioned and try to end her own life , and is now determined her experience will help others			1
during her darkest period @entity6 , 23 , from @entity7 , had to be forcibly medicated in hospital , following two attempted overdoses and was placed on a ventilator			1
but now , having come through the other side , @entity6 has launched an online blog to help other sufferers of mental health problems by showing it is possible to recover and move forward			1
@entity17 hopes sharing her story on her blog will give hope to others struggling with mental health problems @entity6 , who has been diagnosed with a personality disorder , was first sectioned at the age of 18 , beginning a five - year battle with her mental health			1
the professionals who treated her believe the mental health problems which swamped her were sparked by sexual abuse she suffered in her teenage years			1
@entity6 's downward spiral was so great that she became determined to end her life			1
she attempted suicide twice through an overdose , once in june 2012 and again in october 2013			2
on both occasions , when she refused the treatment needed to save her life , she was sedated and placed on a life support machine under the @entity37			2
even once she was off the ventilator , doctors had no option but to deliver her medication forcibly through tubes , and @entity6 would often try and pull out her drips			1
an overdose saw @entity17 placed on life support			2
during her stay in hospital she attempted to pull out the lines giving her medication in a further attempt to end her life but less than six months later , the 23 - year - old is looking to the future after getting her own flat and starting over again			1
she said : ' i had got used to the idea that i would end up killing myself and that i would n't grow old			2
' i wanted to die so much , i was using my toes to try to pull out the treatment tubes when i was in hospital			0
' but i feel really positive now			0
i ca n't believe i have come this far			0
' i think it 's important for people to know there is always hope and you can get better			0
' @entity6 's problems began when she endured six months of sexual abuse by a man she knew			1
so terrified she would not be believed , the then - schoolgirl never reported the attacks to police			0
however , the mental scars stayed with @entity6 throughout her teenage years			1
and as she sat her a-levels she said she began to hear voices in her head			0
at the beginning of december @entity6 moved into her own flat , and as well as writing her blog ( left ) has begun volunteering for a charity that helps blind veterans as the stress of exams and her undiagnosed condition got on top of her , @entity6 began taking high doses of prescription medicine in an attempt to block out her feelings			1
then one day she passed out and was taken to hospital			0
she was eventually sectioned for two weeks at the @entity86 mental health hospital in @entity87 , @entity88			1
' it all happened so quickly , ' she said			0
' one minute i was revising for my exams and the next i was in a mental hospital			1
i had no idea about mental health problems			1
i just thought i must be going crazy			0
' because i was 18 i had to go on an adult ward and i was with people who had been really unwell for a long time			0
' @entity6 spent the next three years in and out of hospital , attempting suicide twice , and in 2011 was diagnosed with @entity100			1
personality disorders typically emerge in adolescence and persist into adulthood			1
@entity100 is best understood as a disorder of mood and how a person interacts with others			0
many people with the condition self - harm and attempt suicide it is estimated that 60 - 70 % of people with @entity100 will attempt suicide at some point in their life			0
@entity100 can cause a range of distressing symptoms and patterns of abnormal behaviour , including : source : @entity123 ' they had to give me the drugs through tubes because i just wanted to die , ' @entity6 said			2
in july 2012 @entity6 was transferred to a specialist hospital in @entity129 , and began her journey to recovery			1
as she recovered she decided to tell people what had happened to her for the first time , writing of her experiences on a blog			0
entitled i 'm not disordered , @entity6 's honest account of her battle with mental illness has now been viewed more than 62,000 times			1
' i started it two years ago , while i was in hospital , ' she said			2
' at first i did n't have much faith in it and i did n't realise how big it would become			0
' but i have now had so many positive comments			0
i had kept my mental health problems a secret for all these years			1
' no one talks about mental illness			0
' even when celebrities do come forward they are always quite guarded about what they say			0
' @entity6 was discharged from the @entity129 hospital last september			1
' almost as quickly as it started it ended , ' @entity6 said			2
' all of a sudden i did n't want to kill myself			0
' i wanted to live my life and recover			0
' on her blog she explains : ' as i progressed through my recovery from @entity100 , i 'd like to think that my blog now also provides people with hope , and determination			2
' that people read it and see that you can feel completely and utterly worthless and hopeless to the point where you think the only way to get any relief is to end your life , and you can come back from that ; you can be happy again			2
you can enjoy being alive again			0
' being in recovery does n't mean my life runs smoothly			2
it does n't mean i do n't feel how i used to or have those thoughts again			0
and it does n't mean i 've forgotten how hard life used to be , or how much hard work i 've had to put in			0
' at the beginning of december last year @entity6 moved into her own flat in @entity7 and has begun volunteering for a charity that helps blind veterans			2
