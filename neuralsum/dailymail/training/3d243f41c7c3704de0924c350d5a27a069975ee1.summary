by @entity0 as @entity3 and @entity4 prepare for their first clash of the new season , relationships between the two clubs could barely be more strained			1
the two @entity8 giants face each other on wednesday night in the @entity10 , @entity12 's equivalent of the @entity13			1
@entity4 's 80,000 seater @entity14 is already sold out , and while the trophy may not be the most prestigious , the ongoing conflict between the two clubs is sure to make the game a heated affair			1
@entity4 chief executive @entity19 wrote to @entity3 this weekend , confirming that he and his colleagues will not be sharing a meal with their @entity23 counterparts on the day of the game			1
the @entity24 had invited both clubs to eat together , but @entity26 claims that ' the deep running disharmony ' between the two clubs would make such a gesture ' pointless '			0
this prompted @entity63 @entity62 to tell @entity56 to ' keep his mouth shut ' , before his opposite number at @entity66 responded by saying ' no one can put a gag on us '			1
this is not the first conflict between the two clubs who , in recent years , have dominated @entity8 football			0
the touchline scrap between @entity75 and @entity36 in the spring of 2013 remains fresh in the memory , and with @entity3 having signed @entity78 and @entity79 from their rivals since then , any civility between the two clubs has disappeared			1
some see the mutual distaste between the two sides as a positive though			0
@entity85 , who managed both teams to respective @entity49 titles , told the @entity88 on sunday that ' the verbals do n't harm the @entity90			0
i think they 're actually quite good			0
they liven up the league '			0
switching allegiance : @entity79 ( left ) and @entity78 ( right ) have moved from @entity4 to @entity3 bitter : @entity78 ( right ) switched clubs in 2013 and @entity79 ( left ) followed him across the divide this summer rivalry : @entity35 will watch his @entity3 team take on @entity4 in a game that promises to be whole - hearted as for @entity4 's indignation over the @entity104 affair , @entity85 was also quick to defend @entity3			1
' there 's no reason for @entity3 to say ' we wo n't buy any more @entity4 players '			1
@entity3 want the best team they can get , so they 'll sign the best players			2
besides , @entity4 signed @entity29 from @entity112 in exactly the same way			1
they used a release clause , just as it seems @entity3 will do next summer '			1
with every man and his wife sticking their oar in , wednesday 's game promises to be an emotional one			2
on the field , both teams are on the back foot			0
@entity35 will be missing several players through injury , including @entity126 , @entity127 and @entity128			0
the @entity3 players who won the @entity130 with @entity12 , meanwhile , have only just returned to training			0
' some will come back quickly , for others it will take longer ' said @entity35 , ' i will ask the doctor who is fit , and make my decisions on that basis '			0
video i 'm a doubt for the @entity139 - @entity138 undercooked : @entity3 's @entity130 winning stars may not be fully fit after a long summer campaign new arrival : @entity3 have signed goalkeeper @entity143 from @entity144 and he could feature absent : @entity128 ( left ) is among the @entity3 stars who will miss the @entity10 through injury after @entity138 was nearly injured during @entity3 's pre-season tour of the @entity149 , though , the @entity147 will be unwilling to risk too much on wednesday			1
the @entity10 has often been used to try out younger players - @entity144 's @entity151 played for @entity3 in the fixture two years ago			1
reports suggest @entity35 may even give a competitive debut to 17 year old @entity155 this time around			0
@entity4 , meanwhile are looking to recover from a humiliating , if meaningless , 4 - 0 drubbing to @entity144 at the weekend			2
@entity36 told @entity158 that the defeat was merely a case of ' playing the wrong opposition on the wrong day ' , and said he was confident that ' we will find our rhythm , and then the energy will return too '			0

the supercup may not be the season highlight , but with @entity4 and @entity3 having contested the last three encounters , it is important if only in the context of their ongoing fights			2
with @entity19 having just extended his contract at @entity4 until 2019 , and @entity3 showing no signs of calling a truce , it is a fight which will go on for a long while yet			2
humiliation : @entity4 were drubbed 4 - 0 by @entity144 at @entity183 at the weekend in a pre-season friendly in shock : @entity4 boss @entity36 looks on as his side are humbled 4 - 0 by @entity144 at @entity183			2
