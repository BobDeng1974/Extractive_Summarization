' a spokesperson for @entity76 , who carried out the survey , said : ' all the women voted for in the top ten are beautiful without make up and absolutely deserve to be there			1
' it ’s nice to see celebrities looking natural now and then just so we can remind ourselves they are actually human too , it ’s also a great thing for the younger generation to see so they can understand make - up is n’t always necessary			2
' first , there was the @entity91 , just as we all learned how to keep outstretched arms out of the shot , the healthie - where celebrities shared snaps of themselves exercising - became the latest slightly smug trend favoured by the famous			0
now comes the turn of the barefaced selfie , with stars from @entity51 to @entity99 and @entity100 choosing to broadcast what they look like without their slap			2
however , while some of them genuinely look like us post-workout or early in the morning ( thank you @entity108 ) , the majority of those choosing to post bare - faced snaps just seem to be , well , showing off			0

it is arrogant , over-confident one - upmanship			0
’ @entity149 casually drapes herself over the back of a boat - note makeup - free yet dewy complexion @entity47 famously loves her selfies - and the make - up loving star has even posted a few bare - faced snaps model @entity157 reminds us how hard she works out to maintain her perfect figure - and still manages to look beautiful when sweaty and red - faced @entity159 is probably too young and fresh faced to need this bleached - out lighting however , the negative reaction has done little to stem the tide of barefaced selfies and it is hard to find a celebrity nowadays who has n't posted one to prove their good looks remain once cosmetics have been stripped away			2
these celebrities have either won the genetic lottery or employed the softest of lighting - but a few have actually had the courage to post pictures where they look less than perfect			0
@entity108 , @entity99 and @entity176 have all bravely shared their red blotches , dark circles and un-perfect pores with us , to prove that you can still be beautiful - even with your flaws on display to the world			0
