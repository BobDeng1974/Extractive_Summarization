hospital staff in @entity1 are turning away sick people on a frigid thursday morning because they ca n't determine whether their @entity4 insurance plans are in effect			1
patients in a close - in @entity8 suburb who think they 've signed up for new insurance plans are struggling to show their december enrollments are in force , and health care administrators are n't taking their word for it			1
in place of quick service and painless billing , these @entity16 are now facing the threat of sticker - shock that comes with bills they ca n't afford			1
' they had no idea if my insurance was active or not ! ' a coughing @entity28 told @entity29 outside the @entity31 facility in the town of @entity33			1
she was leaving the building without getting a needed chest x-ray			1
' the people in there told me that since i did n't have an insurance card , i would be billed for the whole cost of the x-ray , ' @entity28 said , her young daughter in tow			1
' it 's not fair – you know , i signed up last week like i was supposed to			0
' the x-ray 's cost , she was told , would likely be more than $ 500			1
she asked @entity29 not to publish a photograph of her face @entity29 spoke to patients outside hospitals in @entity1 's @entity8 suburbs , many of them confused about the state of their insurance coverage @entity28 said she enrolled in a @entity64 bronze plan at a cost of about $ 450 per month through @entity66 , three days before @entity67			1
' no one has sent me a bill , ' she said			0
@entity72 secretary @entity71 testified in a december 11 congressional hearing that the federal government ca n't say how many new enrollees have written checks for their first month 's premiums			1
' some may have paid , some may have not , ' she conceded			0
it 's unlikely that a valid insurance card would have changed @entity28 ' fortunes , however			2
fifty - nine percent of @entity82 told @entity84 pollsters that they have had negative experiences with the @entity4 , according to the public opinion giant 's latest survey			1
just 39 per cent said their experiences were positive			0
only 7 per cent called their @entity4 journeys ' very positive , ' but 29 per cent said their interaction with the new system has been ' very negative			2
' @entity84 interviewed 1,500 uninsured americans in december , 450 of whom said they had visited health insurance exchange websites			0
as dismal as those numbers are , they represent a slight improvement : in november , @entity84 found that 63 per cent of uninsured @entity82 had negative experiences with the president 's new health care overhaul			0
her @entity64 plan , identified on the @entity4 website as @entity105 , carries a $ 5,500 per - person deductible for 2014 – an amount she would have to pay out - of - pocket before her coverage would apply to medical expenses			1
the @entity31 radiology department would n't speak with @entity29 , and @entity64 did not respond to a request for comment			2
a similar situation frustrated @entity116 , an @entity117 small businesswoman who asked @entity29 not to publish her last name			2
she was leaving the @entity119 in @entity120 , @entity1 with two family members			0
' i had chest pains last night , and they took me in the emergency room , ' @entity116 said			1
' they told me they were going to admit me , but when i told them i had n't heard from my insurance company since i signed up , they changed their tune			2
' she told @entity29 that a nurse advised her that her bill would go up by at least $ 3,000 if she were admitted for a day , and her doctor told her the decision was up to her			1
no x-ray for you : this patient left a @entity1 medical facility without receiving a test her doctor recommended ' should i be in the hospital ? probably , ' she said			1
' maybe it 's one of those borderline cases			0
i have to think that if i were really in danger , they would n't give me the choice			0
but what if i think i 'm covered and i 'm really not ? ' ' the emergency room bill is going to be bad enough			0
' no card , no service : hundreds of thousands of @entity82 are likely in health - insurance limbo with no proof of insurance as the new year begins the @entity4 system has suffered from a long list of setbacks since its october 1 rollout , starting with an inoperable website and ending with rampant uncertainty about whether @entity82 who enrolled are actually covered			1
' we 're telling consumers if they 're not sure if they 're enrolled they should call the insurer directly , ' @entity167 press secretary @entity166 old reporters on december 2			2
the @entity168 reported that day that because of computer glitches in the ' back end ' of @entity66 , enrollment records for as many as one - third of new insurance customers were corrupted or otherwise contain errors			2
given the @entity177 administration 's latest claim that 2.1 million have signed up nationwide , that means as many as 700,000 @entity82 might falsely believe they have a current health insurance policy			0
@entity116 and others like her , who took the time to enroll but may not follow the daily flood of news about @entity4 , likely do n't know one way or the other			2
' why is this so complicated ? ' she asked			0
' i had my own private insurance last year , but they cancelled me in november			0
i 'm not sure which end is up			0
' private industry estimates put the number of policy cancellations as high as 4.7 million in the last quarter of 2013 , mostly involving health care plans that did n't meet the @entity4 's strict minimum standards			2
democrats serving on the @entity196 dispute that number , saying in a new report that no more than 10,000 will wind up without affordable insurance options after losing their old policies			0
the @entity31 in @entity33 , @entity1 offers free valet parking , but if you want to see a doctor you 'll need proof that you 've paid your @entity4 premium still working : emergency services are still being provided at @entity1 hospitals , whether or not patients can prove they 're covered -- but getting a bed in a hospital ward could come with a tremendous sticker - shock president @entity177 has attracted widespread criticism , and a ' lie of the year ' award from one newspaper 's fact - checker , for promising that @entity82 who liked their health plans would be allowed to keep them			1
dr. @entity220 , a @entity221 gastroenterologist , told the @entity222 on thursday that he is seeing ' tremendous uncertainty and anxiety ' among his patients who signed up for @entity4 plans but do n't have insurance cards			1
' they ’re not sure if they have coverage , ' @entity220 said			0
' it puts the heavy work on the physician			0
' ' at some point , every practice is going to make a decision about how long can they continue to see these patients for free if they are not getting paid			0

@entity29 spoke with patients who were told they would have to pay their bills in full if they could n't prove they had insurance
one was faced with a $ 3,000 hospital room charge and opted to leave the hospital after experiencing chest pains
' should i be in the hospital ? probably , ' she said
another , coughing in the cold , *walked* out without receiving a needed chest x-ray
consumers face sticker - shock from medical costs under the new @entity4 system , made worse if they ca n't prove they 're insured
as many as one - third of new enrollees ' *applications* have seen *problems* when the government transmits them to insurance companies
