' we wanted to copy the natural colour , which is pink , so they would stay pink longer			2
then we tried and tested with other colours and they have now become the most well - known products we have			0
' the dying process is unique and has been refined enough for the farmers to produce over 3 million flowers each year in 29 acres			0
they now export to the rest of @entity67			0
