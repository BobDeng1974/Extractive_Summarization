@entity0 knows his second coming at @entity2 will be a whole lot tougher than his first after this @entity5 derby			1
where previously he commanded players the calibre of @entity10 and @entity11 in a league shorn of @entity13 , his squad now are not at that level and @entity13 reign supreme			0
he returned to the @entity17 dugout , where he won three @entity19 titles and two @entity20 before his sacking in may 2008 , more experienced from his time at @entity23			1
he will need all his nous to send @entity2 to the summit once more			1
in his first match since taking over from @entity27 , @entity0 oversaw a 1 - 1 draw here , in an encounter that was low on quality			1
5 ) , @entity54 6 ; @entity33 7.5 ; @entity55 ( @entity56 73 , 5 ) goal : @entity33 23 booked : @entity48 , @entity50 manager : @entity59 6 @entity2 : @entity38 6.5 ; @entity60 6.5 , @entity61 6 , @entity62 6.5 , @entity63 6.5 ; @entity64 6.5 , @entity65 6.5 , @entity40 7 ( @entity66 72 , 6 ) ; @entity67 7 ( @entity68 90 ) ; @entity69 4.5 ( @entity70 89 ) , @entity71 6 booked : @entity40 , @entity62 manager : @entity0 6.5 ref : @entity73 7 mom : @entity33 att : 79,173 it did include a wonderful goal from @entity33 in the 23rd minute			1
the @entity77 international applied a cushioned volley of exquisite technique to @entity54 ’s cross to send the ball past @entity38 with pinpoint accuracy			0
credit to @entity51 for the clever pass that unleashed @entity54			0
@entity40 found an equaliser that @entity0 ’s side deserved in the second half , to leave both @entity5 teams with a point that neither will really savour			1
rather like @entity92 versus @entity93 on saturday evening , this was a match between two once proud title challengers reduced to hopefuls for their country ’s final @entity97 place			0
it was eighth versus ninth , each far back from leaders @entity13 , who look likely to run away with this scudetto as they did the last			2
@entity2 won most recent of their five successive @entity19 titles ( the first awarded when @entity13 were stripped due to the @entity105 scandal ) in 2010 , when @entity106 left for @entity107			1
they have had six permanent managers since but zero trophies , now turning once more to @entity0			1
@entity5 last won the @entity110 under @entity111 in 2011 and this year replaced @entity112 with his former teammate @entity59 following poor results			1
neither @entity5 club finished in the top four last season			1
but while the football may not be what it once was , the atmosphere remains fearsome			0
rival ultras at either end of this shared stadium produced impressive banners before kick - off and kept the flag - waving and noise going throughout the match			0
inside the first three minutes , each set of supporters bayed for a penalty			2
@entity2 cried loud as @entity69 fell , @entity5 when @entity51 went down			1
the cat calls were sent @entity69 ’s way in the eighth minute when the @entity2 striker missed a glorious chance			2
@entity40 's exuberant celebration went on as he capped off a nice move to slot home to level the scores @entity33 's team - mates piled on top of him after the @entity77 gave the hosts the lead with his measured finish @entity52 , who played in @entity2 ’s 2010 @entity97 final success , must have thought he still wore @entity5 blue rather than red – carelessly placing a pass straight to the 21 - year - old @entity146 that allowed him bear down on goal			1
but as @entity69 approached the area his confidence seemed to ebb away and @entity45 , an experienced goalkeeper , managed to block his tame finish before @entity48 scrambled the ball clear			0
dozens of @entity5 fans in the @entity155 raced from their seats to mock their rival player nearby			2
@entity69 would fare no better nine minutes after the interval , when the ball came his way in the area after a goalmouth scramble that should have seen @entity2 equalise , only for him to balloon the ball high over the bar			1
with 12 minutes remaining @entity69 found space in the area to arrive onto a cross from the right but sent his shot onto the top of the crossbar			0
he was not the only striker who struggled , however			0
@entity171 continues to perform with nothing like the drive and ruthlessness that characterised his glory years at @entity176			0
escaping from @entity178 on loan , this was supposed to offer the freedom he never really found at @entity181			0
there was little evidence of that			0
at one stage in the first half he had the chance to run at @entity189 defender @entity62 but lacked conviction and was easily dispossessed			0
the @entity191 was replaced by @entity192 after 72 minutes			0
@entity0 waves to the gathered group of photographers ahead of the @entity5 derby in his first game back in charge at @entity2 @entity199 enjoys derby return @entity54 reacts after missing a presentable opportunity to put his side ahead late in the game @entity189 defender @entity63 ( left ) ca n't prevent @entity5 's @entity46 whipping in a cross during a lively first half former @entity178 midfielder @entity51 ( right ) vies for the ball with @entity2 's @entity40 @entity69 ( centre ) attempts to prod a ball beyond @entity45 with former @entity209 man @entity52 in tow @entity5 coach @entity59 - famed for his goalscoring exploits at the club - directs his side during the @entity19 clash @entity215 ( right ) hooks a dangerous bouncing ball away under the close attention of @entity54 @entity59 dishes out strict instructions to his @entity77 defender @entity46 during a feisty encounter @entity171 struggles to keep his balance during an aerial duel with opposing skipper @entity61 @entity51 tries to fend off the interests of @entity2 defender @entity62 with captain @entity61 close by even @entity227 , who @entity171 used to terrorise in @entity228 , would have fancied his chances had he made it from the bench			1
that the former @entity93 captain failed to feature here undermines to some degree the accusations his departure from @entity236 was shocking mismanagement			0
@entity2 were the better side up until @entity5 took the lead but found an equaliser just after the hour mark			1
@entity40 wriggled past @entity51 on the edge of the area and swept a left foot shot that angled inside the far post and beyond the dive of 6ft 5in @entity45			2
no such composure from @entity54 in the 75th minute			0
@entity33 seized on a heavy touch from @entity62 to send the @entity5 winger clean through but , at the same end where @entity69 missed , he lifted his finish too high and the ball clipped the crossbar and went over			1
at the death @entity53 almost won it for @entity5 but his deflected shot trundled just wide			2
@entity0 could head down the tunnel with a smile			2
@entity260 shows multiple live games from @entity262 ’s @entity19 every week as part of a @entity265 football line - up including @entity266 , @entity268 ’s @entity267 and @entity77 ’s @entity269 .			2

@entity0 had a @entity5 derby first up in his second spell in charge of @entity2
the pair met at the @entity17 in @entity19 and @entity33 gave @entity5 an early lead
@entity40 levelled the scores on 63 minutes as the *visitors* clawed their way back into the game
