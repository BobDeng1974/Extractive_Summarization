' fake ' autographs : classical singer @entity1 has called in trading standards classical singer @entity1 has called in trading standards officials to investigate a company for selling allegedly fake signed photos of her			1
the 34 - year - old mezzo - soprano posted on @entity8 yesterday that @entity9 in @entity10 , @entity11 , was selling the pictures - adding : ‘ i did not sign these ’			1
but the company claimed to @entity14 today that it obtained the four signed images and a @entity17 cd from a supplier who bought them at a charity auction in 2012 after they were donated by her management			2
miss @entity1 tweeted yesterday : ‘ want to warn you that @entity9 is selling “ authentic ” photos signed by me			1
i did not sign these and we 're reporting to trading standards			2
’ however the company said it was ‘ aggrieved ’ that @entity30 had taken to @entity8 to report a problem with the pictures before members of her management had got in touch			1
a spokesman told @entity14 : ‘ we 're quite annoyed she tweeted without anybody contacting us first , so that we could do something about this			0
as soon as we were aware of it , we immediately removed them			0
‘ we only had three or four photos and a @entity17 cd signed by her			0
i 've gone back to the guy who bought them from a charity auction , and [ he said ] they were donated by her management in 2012			0
’ it was tonight still unconfirmed where the photographs came from , but miss @entity1 's management insisted that she ' obviously knows her own signature ' and ' did not sign ' them			1
took to @entity8 : miss @entity1 is concerned about a company selling allegedly fake signed photos of her autograph session : miss @entity1 is pictured signing copies of her new album at @entity59 last november he added : ‘ if anybody contacts us , whoever it is , we 're always responsive and immediately take action			1
we 've certainly had no disgruntled customer about it			0
it 's come completely out of the blue			0
’ miss @entity1 's memorabilia would usually sell for £ 20 to £ 30 , the company said , adding that it had not yet been contacted by trading standards - but would keep the items available for inspection			1
but miss @entity1 ’s manager , @entity75 , told @entity14 : ‘ we tried to contact the company			1
@entity1 also hardly ever signs her photos “ @entity1 ” so you can quite clearly tell someone is forging them			2
‘ @entity1 spends hours and hours of time to sign things herself and that 's why she was particularly upset as she does n't want her fans to be ripped off			1
she regularly tweets that people can send in anything as she is happy to sign them for free			2
happy couple : miss @entity90 with her partner , film director @entity92 , whom she married last year ‘ it was brought to our attention as a fan had purchased one which had a certificate of authentication and had asked @entity1 to personalise it			1
' @entity1 obviously knows her own signature and realised straight away she did not sign it			1
‘ we still have this in our possession as proof and when on further investigation we looked at their website they themselves had four or five different forms of @entity1 's signature			2
we also emailed autograph trading standards and they are assisting			0
' autographed @entity114 insists on its website that all signed items are supplied by ' an established music and media industry employee , a person that we 've known both personally and professionally for many years '			0
the firm - which is is run from a £ 350,000 four - bedroom detached house - also claims to be a member of the @entity126 , although it is not listed within the @entity129 - based organisation 's official dealer directory			0
website : @entity9 claimed it obtained the four signed images and a christmas cd from a supplier who bought them at a charity auction in 2012 after they were donated by her management the @entity139 confirmed tonight that it was investigating the complaint , but this could take months – and it was normal practise to ask trading standards to get involved			0
an @entity146 spokesman said : ‘ @entity1 's management company contacted us to say that there was a company called @entity151 selling autographs of her that were not authentic			1
‘ we had a look at it , and there were probably about half a dozen that @entity1 said were n’t her signature			2
they do have a lot of quite unique stuff			0
it ’s not a company that we ’ve heard of before			0
’ an @entity164 spokesman said : ‘ the @entity164 ’s trading standards team has not received complaints about this company and is not currently pursuing any investigation into this matter			0
