' androgen insensitivity syndrome ( @entity9 ) is when a person who is genetically male ( who has one x and one y chromosome ) is resistant to male hormones ( called androgens )			1
as a result , the person has some or all of the physical traits of a woman , but the genetic makeup of a man			0
it is caused by genetic defects on the x chromosome			0

most people with this condition are not diagnosed until they do not get a menstrual period or they have trouble getting pregnant			0
incomplete @entity9 is often discovered during childhood because the person may have both male and female physical traits			1

' the way that we took care of things in the past ... where there was a fair amount of secrecy , where there was surgery done in the infant state , and potentially irreversible surgery , is probably not the best way to go about things , ' said dr. @entity214 , who runs the two - year - old sex development disorders program at @entity8 's @entity216			0
