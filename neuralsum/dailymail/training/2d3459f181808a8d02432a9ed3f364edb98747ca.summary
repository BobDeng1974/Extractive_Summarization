by @entity0 published : 19:05 est , 2 february 2014 @entity2 : 19:49 est , 2 february 2014 an art - loving businessman faces the prospect of seeing one of his treasured paintings thrown into a furnace to be destroyed after it featured on a @entity8 show about fakes and forgeries			0
@entity12 bought what he thought was an original work by @entity16 - born artist @entity15 in 1992 for £ 100,000			1
more than 20 years later his son called in experts from @entity20 's @entity19 to examine it			1
@entity12 , who has been told a painting he paid £ 100,000 for will be burned after it was ruled a fake , at home in @entity26 with his wife @entity27 and son @entity28 the ' @entity15 ' painting bought by @entity30 businessman @entity12 for £ 100,000 which has now been ruled a fake viewers of tonight 's show will see the watercolour , a nude said to date from 1909 - 10 , undergo a series of scientific tests in an attempt to prove whether it is genuine before it is finally sent to the @entity38 in @entity39 for examination			1
but the committee , which is run by the artist 's grandchildren to protect his reputation in the art world , said it is a fake and told the show that under @entity49 law they will have the painting burned			2
the show 's host , @entity51 , said : ' a decision like this forces the owner of any painting to play a kind of @entity16 roulette with their precious artwork			0
' the only way for @entity12 to authenticate his painting was with the @entity38 , he had no other choice			2
master : @entity16 - born artist @entity15 , pictured in 1933 @entity12 bought what he thought was an original work by @entity15 in 1992 ' but it was never made clear to him that if they did n't like the look of his painting that they would burn it			1
how can anyone ever approach this committee with a painting again if this is how they react ? ' mr @entity12 , 63 , a property developer from @entity26 , has asked the committee to mark the painting as a forgery and then return it or give him a guarantee he will be reimbursed if it is later ruled as genuine but is still waiting for a reply			2
he said : ' i had no idea that anyone would take such a draconian view			0
they say they want to counter forgery but i think this will have the opposite effect of deterring honest people like myself from coming forward			0
' @entity15 , who died in 1985 , is regarded as a pioneer of modernism and his work can sell for millions of pounds .			0
