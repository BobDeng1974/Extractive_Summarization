our solar system had a close encounter with another star 70,000 years ago , new research has revealed			1
the recently discovered star passed just 0.8 light years away from our own sun and was so close it passed through the icy cloud of outer comets that encircles our solar system			1
this makes it the closest a star has come to our solar system - five times nearer than @entity15 , our current closest stellar neighbour			1
@entity18 star , shown in the artists impression above as behind its brown dwarf companion in the foreground , passed within 0.8 light years of the @entity23 ( shown as the bright star on the left ) around 70,000 years ago since that encounter , the star , which is known as @entity18 's star , has moved off at high speed and is now thought to be around 20 light years away			1
far beyond the orbit of @entity34 , trillions of comets left over from the formation of the solar system lie in wait in a region known as the @entity40 cloud			2
here they are kept in relatively stable orbits around the sun , posing little threat to @entity45 save for the occasional icy rock that ventures inwards			0
but in the blink of a cosmic eye that could all change , as stars have been found that could pass near our solar system in 240,000 years - and it they might shower us with thousands of deadly comets			2
according to dr @entity58 from the @entity59 in @entity60 , @entity61 , there are several stars that could pose a danger to our solar system			0
as our sun performs its cosmic dance around the @entity68 , it comes closer to and further from other stars in the vicinity			2
astronomers discovered the star 's flyby by tracing its movement through the sky and found it would have passed within the outer @entity78 of comets			1
dr @entity80 , an astronomer at the @entity81 who led the study , said that it is unlikely the star would have caused much disturbance to the scattered icy comets that orbit the outermost reaches of our solar system			2
however , he said it raised the possiblity that other close encounters with stars in the future could have a far greater impact			0
he said : ' using the best available astrometry , our simulations suggest that the probability that the star penetrated the outer @entity78 is ∼ 98 %			1
' while the flyby of this system likely caused negligible impact on the flux of longperiod comets , the recent discovery of this binary highlights that dynamically important @entity78 perturbers may be lurking among nearby stars			2
' @entity18 's star was first discovered in 2014 by @entity18 but unlike other stars around it , it appeared to have an unusual motion in the sky			1
a team of scientists from the @entity118 , @entity119 , @entity120 and @entity121 used observations of its motion to trace back its trajectory			0
they found that the star is moving away from the @entity45 at great speed and came alarmingly close 70,000 years ago			1
the @entity78 is a region filled with icy comets around our solar system , as shown in the graphic above they calculated that the star , which also has the catchy name @entity136 , passed five trillion miles away from our sun ( 0.8 light years away )			1
@entity15 , our closest neighbour , is 4.2 light years away			1
however , even this close it would have been impossible to see the star from @entity45 with the naked eye as it is far too dim			2
the scientists believe it is an active red dwarf star that is about 8 per cent the mass of our own sun. it is part of a binary star system and is accompanied by a brown dwarf - a failed star that was too small to spark into life			0
even when at its closest to @entity45 , @entity18 's star would have been 50 times fainter than what can normally be seen with the naked eye			1
instead the star would only have been visible with a telescope - technology far beyond our ancestors 70,000 years ago			1
however , the star may have occassionally flared and become brighter for a few minutes			0
for any of our ancestors who glanced upwards during such a flare , they would have seen it in the area around the @entity166			0
the astronomers , whose work is published in the journal @entity170 , calculated that @entity18 's star 's path would have taken it through the outer areas of the @entity78			1
the @entity40 cloud is a vast and mysterious region that is thought to surround our solar system			0
it contains trillions of comets left over from the birth of the universe - and possibly larger objects like dwarf planets as well			0
it begins at about 0.08 light - years from the sun - 170 times the orbit of @entity34 - and extends out to about 0.8 light - years			2
occasionally , comets from the region make their way into the solar system , known as long - period comets			0
one of the most famous this year was comet @entity195 , which brushed past @entity196 on 19 october			0
however , apart from these brief visitors , not much is known about the @entity40 cloud			0
it has never been directly observed , and it is not exactly known how large it is - although it is thought to define the gravitational influence of the sun. the @entity40 cloud ( illustrated ) is a vast and mysterious region that is thought to surround our solar system			0
it contains trillions of comets left over from the birth of the universe - and possibly larger objects like dwarf planets as well			0
long - period comets originate here , while short - period comets come from the @entity215 large comets in this icy region of space give rise to the comets that enter the innner solar system if their orbits are disturbed			0
simulations of the trajectory of @entity18 's star showed that while it passed through this area it is unlikely to have triggered a comet shower			1
until now , the top candidate for the closest flyby of a star to the solar system was the so - called ' @entity235 , which was predicted to come close to our solar system in 240,000 to 470,000 years from now			2
however , @entity80 and his collaborators have also demonstrated that the original distance to @entity239 was likely underestimated by a factor of ten			0
at its more likely distance – about 200 light years – @entity244 85605 ’s newly calculated trajectory would not bring it within the @entity78			1
at its closest , @entity18 's star would have been moving across the sky at an 70 arcseconds per year - at this speed it would have moved the distance of the @entity251 in the sky in 26 years			1
dr @entity80 said : ' the small tangential motion and proximity initially indicated that the star was most likely either moving towards a future close encounter with the solar system , or it had ‘ recently ’ come close to the solar system and was moving away			2
' sure enough , the radial velocity measurements were consistent with it running away from the @entity23 ’s vicinity – and we realized it must have had a close flyby in the past			0

@entity18 's star was discovered in 2014 but appeared to have an odd motion
astronomers traced its path through the sky and found it is moving away
they found it came closer than any other known star 70,000 years ago
it passed so close that it passed through the outer @entity78 of comets
our current nearest star is @entity15 around 4.2 light years away
the @entity287 's star came five times closer but is now 20 light years away
