@entity7 and her two - year - old daughter @entity36 sleep on a sofa bed in the lounge alongside three - month - old twins @entity54 and @entity38 , who lie in @entity56 baskets			1
@entity8 , meanwhile , beds down wherever he can find a space			1
problem solved : @entity8 with his daughters @entity33 ( left ) , @entity30 and his son @entity34 in their one bedroom , which they have now moved out of complaint : the family said they had no room for their family			1

' i 've been here ten years but i 've wanted to move since i had my first child and she 's eight now , ' mrs @entity7 said			1
complaints : the fertile pair say the pill , condoms , arm implants and an injection have all failed to stop them conceiving no fun : the lack of space meant the family have had to pay for storage for belongings and toys ' i had the twins this april and the council knew i was pregnant because i went and told them			2
' i bid for a house and they said i was top priority but another person had been on the list longer so she got it			0
squeezed in : the parents , who have n't worked since 2005 , say they can not understand why the council wo n't rehouse them ' my girls are literally always arguing because they want their own space and my son has a pink and yellow room			1
' the four - bed homes are like gold dust			2
i 've been told i 'm a main priority but then they are given to someone else			0
' i reckon they should build more four bedroom houses because all the ones they have are full			0
' all my friends and family say it is disgusting and that i should n't be in this situation			0
' i just have to keep bidding if i 'm going to be given a move			0
' she was working in telesales when she first moved into the one - bedroom council flat in 2003 by herself			2
the following year she married labourer @entity8 and their eldest child @entity30 was born in 2005 - and the couple have n't worked since			1
the 26 - year - old says she begged her doctor to be sterilised but was told she was too young to be considered			1
she added : ' i had contraception for all the children apart from my first one			2
' i had the needle , i took the pill , i had the implant and for the twins i was taking the pill and had an implant			0
' the doctor just said i was really fertile and they do n't know what to do			0
' i am too young to get sterilised and @entity8 tried using a condom as well			1
' the house has no space for storage so i have to spend £ 137 a month for a storage space on a industrial estate			0
' costly : the family rely on a total of £ 27,000 in benefits paid out to them and their six children , who are all under the age of eight @entity7 's midwife , health visitor and local @entity171 mp @entity170 have all written to the authorities about the family 's plight			2
@entity175 said they would not move a family into a new home if there was still going to be an issue with overcrowding			0
a spokesman said : ' housing associations do not accept nominations for houses where applicants would be classed as overcrowded so applicants with a four - bed need are advised not to bid on three - bed houses			0
' social housing is scarce and bids made through the @entity192 website are considered by the waiting time on the housing register			0
' where families have a need for large homes , they are offered support with looking for a house in the private sector and given information on a mutual exchange swap			0

@entity7 and husband @entity8 have not worked since first baby in 2005
mrs @entity7 says she is ' super-fertile ' - which makes contraception fail
she says she has begged her doctor for sterilisation but is too young
they say the council has ignored their demands for a new home for 8 years
