@entity2 governor @entity1 's campaign strategy , described by one insider to @entity4 as becoming ' everyone 's second choice , ' is paying dividends early with poll numbers that put him out front nationally among @entity9			1
a @entity11 survey released tuesday found @entity1 is the clear favorite of one in four @entity9 voters , with both moderates and the tea - party right wing giving him high marks			1
that 25 per cent showing is well ahead of former @entity20 gov. @entity19 , whose 17 per cent showing is a poor indicator of any public - opinion muscle his gargantuan fundraising advantage might earn him			1
even dr. @entity26 , an outsider who only brought on a campaign finance chairwoman this week – former @entity29 fundraising coordinator @entity28 – placed one point ahead of @entity19 , with 18 per cent support			1
@entity32 , me ? @entity1 gov. @entity1 has emerged as an early @entity9 favorite in the first lap of a very long 2016 race @entity36 : former @entity20 gov. @entity19 is lagging behind the leader despite a presumed massive fundraising advantage the numbers tell an early story , with the @entity9 ' nominating convention still 17 months away in @entity42 , but will do wonders for @entity1 's ability to attract high - dollar donors and earn critical media exposure among a crowded field as the race begins to take shape			1
in a separate poll published tuesday , @entity1 drew into a statistical dead heat for the lead in @entity53 , where his 19 per cent showing was just one point lower than that of home - state favorite sen. @entity56			1
that @entity59 / @entity58 poll showed @entity56 with a commanding 25 percentage point lead over all other potential 2016 presidential nominees just four months ago			2
in tuesday 's numbers , @entity1 atracted support from twice as many @entity64 as the state 's outgoing governor @entity65			1
@entity56 was near the bottom of the pile in @entity11 's national sample , with just 5 per cent support			1
former @entity72 gov. @entity71 , who ended his @entity74 weekend talk show last month to explore his options , placed behind @entity1 , @entity26 and @entity19 at 10 per cent			1
@entity77 gov. @entity76 tied with @entity56 at 5 per cent			1
@entity79 sen. @entity78 registered 4 per cent support in the @entity11 poll ; @entity65 and @entity20 sen. @entity82 came last , tied at 3 per cent			1
' @entity1 is climbing fast in the polling because of his appeal to the most conservative elements of the @entity9 electorate , ' @entity11 noted			2
he crushes the field among @entity9 voters who identify themselves as ' very conservative , ' winning support from 37 per cent of them			2
next - best among ' very conservative ' @entity90 is @entity26 with 19 per cent for @entity26 , then @entity19 with 12 per cent and @entity71 with 11			1
' there are two times more @entity9 primary voters who identify as " very conservative " than there are ones who identify as moderates , ' reports @entity11			2
some @entity19 insiders say the former governor aims to raise as much as $ 100 million by the end of march in a ' shock and awe ' financial blitz designed to intimidate his potential opponents			0
but the poll numbers show he has yet to make serious inroads with the @entity106 crowd			0
just 37 per cent of ' very conservative ' @entity9 say they have a favorable impression of him , compared with 43 per cent who say they have an ' unfavorable ' opinion			0
those ' under water ' numbers could spell trouble for @entity19 on the eve of the @entity116 , a three - day event where he has opted for a more laid - back q&a with @entity74 moderator @entity120 instead of a more traditional speech			0
while @entity19 is seen as an establishment fundraising behemoth , his 37 – 43 showing indicates a distrust he 's earned from right - wing partisans who fear the prospect of pitting a political moderate against @entity128 , the @entity129 ' all - but - inevitable nominee			2
by comparison @entity26 's approve / disapprove numbers among the most conservative @entity9 voters are 73 - 2 , @entity1 's are 68 - 3 and @entity56 's are 68 - 8			1
' the party is either going to win with a conservative next year or lose with @entity137 2.0 , ' one @entity135 political consultant told @entity4			0
' the base senses that , and the story of 2016 will be whether all of @entity19 's money is enough to buy his way in to the winner 's circle			2
' but a @entity9 national committeeman countered that ' gov. @entity19 is one of the party 's most reliable conservative voices , and ultimately the far - right snake - oil - sellers will shoot themselves in the foot			2
it 's a long campaign , and we need someone steady at the helm			0
' neither man agreed to be identified			0
@entity157 : retired pediatric neurosurgeon dr. @entity26 placed one point ahead of @entity19 in the latest national poll of @entity9 primary voters in the hunt : former @entity72 gov. @entity71 had a 10 per cent showing in the @entity11 survey a @entity1 insider outlined one of his campaign 's strategies a week ago in a conversation with @entity4 online , predicting that the party would fracture by the end of 2015 ith @entity19 on one side and tea party stalwarts like @entity56 , @entity65 and @entity26 on the other			1
becoming ' everyone 's second choice , ' the adviser said , is @entity1 's most likely path to victory – especially in a contest with more than a dozen credible contenders			0
' the tea partiers are goign to love @entity56 , and they 'll all wish they could elect @entity26 , ' the aide explained			0
' the rest of the voters will feel safe with @entity19			0
' but neither camp is thought to have the ability to overwhelm the field , potentially setting up @entity1 as a consensus choice next year			0
the governor is treading carefully in the early going , telling reporters three days ago in @entity191 that if he forally runs for president , ' i ’m not going to go out and attack my opponents			0
' but monday night at a convention of @entity198 broadcasters , he carved out some distance between himself and @entity19 with a story about his hardscrabble family history			0
' i realize that unlike some out there , i did n't inherit fame or fortune from my family , ' @entity1 said			0
' i got a bunch of things that were a whole lot better than that			0

@entity11 found the @entity2 governor is favored by 25 per cent of @entity9 voters
outsider @entity26 is second with 18 per cent , one point ahead of fundraising leader @entity19 's 17
@entity71 at 10 per cent , gov. @entity76 and sen. @entity56 at 5 , sen. @entity78 at 4 , and gov. @entity65 and sen. @entity82 at 3
a separate poll in @entity53 shows @entity1 in a statistical dead heat with in - state favorite @entity56 , closing a 25 - point *gap* since *october*
