by @entity0 for years tv gardeners like @entity2 have advocated putting broken terracotta pieces , or ' crocks ' , in a pot to protect a plant			1
but the long - established gardening trick , which is supposed to help water drainage , has been rubbished by experts who claim it can actually harm them			1
the method , passed down through generations of gardeners , is said to stop the soil becoming too waterlogged			1
tradition : the method , which involves covering holes at the bottom of plant pots , has been rubbished by experts who claim it could actually saturate the plant now a team of experts at which ? magazine have undermined the claim having carried out a series of controlled tests			1
they used 40 10 - litre pots and planted five ' @entity30 ' in each one			0
the perennial plant was chosen because it is known to get root rot in very damp soil			2
half of the pots were plastic and half were made of clay , and 50 per cent of these had crocks added to them			2
some were also put on saucers the idea of placing pieces of broken terracotta pots or polystyrene over the hole at the bottom of containers is believed improve drainage and stop waterlogging			1
soil scientists , hydrologists and environmental engineers have however suggested that when water reaches two different textures , a coarse layer and a fine layer , the flow can change in peculiar directions			2
the difference between crocks and the soil is similar to the way sand works on a golf putting green			2
putting sand below the surface helps compact the water while also assisting in drainage			2
however , the water sometimes does not travel between the two layers because of capillary forces			0
this leaves what scientists call a ' perched ' water table above where it should be			0
this means when there is heavy rain , the plant will remain dry for a short time , but will eventually become saturated			0
each container was regularly watered and when the plants had bloomed there was found to be no difference between the pots with crocks in and ones without			0
@entity90 , editor of which ? gardening , was part of the team behind the test			0
she said : ' despite six - in - ten of gardeners telling us they always use crocks in pots , we found that this made no difference to how well the plants did in our tests			1
' in fact , in wet summers crocks can prevent water draining out of the pot and do more harm than good , so think twice before you follow this commonplace habit			1
' @entity2 was not available to address the new research but has previously advised gardeners to use crocks on the @entity116 gardening website			1
he states : ' cover the base of the pot with a layer of crocks ( ask at the garden centre they usually have a few broken pots ) and cover with a 5cm ( 2in ) layer of gravel			0
' this improves drainage and prevents soil washing out of the container			0
' @entity130 , group plant buyer at @entity133 garden centre in @entity134 , @entity135 , insists that crocks do help container planting			1
he said : ' at the bottom of most pots you have a large hole or three or four smaller holes			0
' if you lay broken terracotta , rubble , or polystyrene on top of the hole , when you put the soil in it wo n't clog up the hole			0
' when the plant is watered , the water can then drain through the crocks and out of the hole			1
' we have always put crocks in our pots at @entity133 and will continue to do so			0
' in january and february they made a big difference because we had so much rain and they helped to stop the plants getting waterlogged			0
' myth ? the practice , being demonstrated by @entity161 at @entity162 in @entity135 , may prevent the water from effectively draining from the pot rubbished : tests to prove if the method works showed that if there was heavy rain , the plants would become waterlogged common : the practice was advocated by gardeners including @entity2			1

tv gardeners like @entity2 advocated method to stop waterlogging
but experts at which ? have rubbished claims after a series of tests
claimed that when it rains , the crocks prevent water draining from the plant
but a buyer from @entity188 insists they help with plant life
