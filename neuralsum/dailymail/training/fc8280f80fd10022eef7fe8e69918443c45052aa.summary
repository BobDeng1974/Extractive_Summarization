by @entity0 published : 10:55 est , 1 march 2013 updated : 10:56 est , 1 march 2013 researchers have revealed the surface of @entity3 was once covered with a vast ocean of magma			1
scientists analysing data from a spacecraft orbiting the plan have been baffled by odd readings that showed unexplained chemical differences between rocks			0
now they say the differences may have been caused by a vast ocean of magma that created layers of crystals , which melted then erupted			2
the spacecraft 's seven scientific instruments and radio science investigation are unraveling the history and evolution of the planet closest to the @entity35 during its one - year primary mission , @entity36 acquired 88,746 images			0
it is now in an extended mission , during which plans call for the acquisition of more than 80,000 additional image			0
scientists at @entity45 have proposed that @entity3 may have harbored a large , ocean of magma very early in its history , shortly after its formation about 4.5 billion years ago			1
the scientists analyzed data gathered by @entity36 , a @entity52 probe that has orbited the planet since march 2011			0
scientists analyzed x-ray fluorescence data from the probe , and identified two distinct compositions of rocks on the planet ’s surface - but were baffled by the differences			2
the mit team used the compositional data to recreate the two rock types in the lab , and subjected each synthetic rock to high temperatures and pressures to simulate various geological processes			2
from their experiments , the scientists came up with only one phenomenon to explain the two compositions : a vast magma ocean that created two different layers of crystals , solidified , then eventually remelted into magma that then erupted onto @entity3 ’s surface			1
' the thing that ’s really amazing on @entity3 is , this did n’t happen yesterday , ' said @entity78 , a professor of geology at @entity45			2
' the crust is probably more than 4 billion years old , so this magma ocean is a really ancient feature			1
' the team translated the chemical element ratios from the surface into the corresponding building blocks that make up rocks , such as magnesium oxide , silicon dioxide and aluminum oxide			1
the researchers then consulted what @entity92 refers to as a ' pantry of oxides ' — finely powdered chemicals — to recreate the rocks in the lab. ' we just mix these together in the right proportions and we ’ve got a synthetic copy of what ’s on the surface of @entity3 , ' @entity78 says			1
the researchers then melted the samples of synthetic rock in a furnace , cranking the heat up and down to simulate geological processes that would cause crystals — and eventually rocks — to form in the melt			0
@entity111 flows from @entity113 volcano : experts say magma may have once covered the surface of @entity3 , explaining the strange chemical composition of rocks on the surface ' you can tell what would happen as the melt cools and crystals form and change the chemical composition of the remaining melted rock , ' @entity78 says			1
' the leftover melt changes composition			0
' after cooling the samples , the researchers picked out tiny crystals and melt pockets for analysis			0
@entity78 found the two compositions were too different to have originated from the same region , and instead may have come from two separate regions within the planet			0
the easiest explanation for what created these distinct regions , @entity78 says , is a large magma ocean , which over time likely formed different compositions of crystals as it solidified			1
this molten ocean eventually remelted , spewing lava onto the surface of the planet in massive volcanic eruptions			2
the images reveal giant craters on the surface of @entity3 seen in unprecedented detail			2
this basin 's outer rim is about 306 km in diameter and the inner ( peak ) ring is about 140 km in diameter @entity92 estimates that this magma ocean likely existed very early in @entity3 ’s existence — possibly within the first 1 million to 10 million years — and may have been created from the violent processes that formed the planet			1
as the solar nebula condensed , bits and pieces collided into larger chunks to form tiny , and then larger , planets			0
that process of colliding and accreting may produce enough energy to completely melt the planet — a scenario that would make an early magma ocean very feasible			1
' the acquisition of data by spacecraft must be combined with laboratory experiments , ' @entity170 says			0
' although these data are valuable by themselves , experimental studies on these compositions enable scientists to reach the next level in the interpretation of planetary evolution			0

surface *believed* to have been covered in large magma ocean which remelted several times
team recreated @entity3 rocks in the lab to test their theory
