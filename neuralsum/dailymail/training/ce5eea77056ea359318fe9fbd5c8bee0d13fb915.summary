by @entity0 for @entity1 for most people , the prospect of eating @entity4 dinner while holed up in the garden shed would not be an enticing one			2
but for @entity7 , 62 , the experience last year was one of luxury after he transformed his lean - to into a precise imitation of the dining room found on the @entity13			1
the railway engineer , from @entity15 , @entity16 , has spent up to Â£ 10,000 turning the tiny structure into a replica of the lavish room - made famous in the 1997 film about the doomed ship			1
@entity7 , 62 , is so pleased with his replica of the @entity13 's dining room that he even ate his @entity4 dinner in there last year the railway engineer , from @entity15 , @entity16 , has spent thousands turning the tiny structure into an exact copy of the lavish room - made famous in 1997 film @entity13 he has claimed that his creation could be worth ten times that to the right collector			1
the corrugated - iron shed features wooden panels , chairs and dining sets from the ship 's sister liner , the @entity41 - all of which mr @entity7 has collected over 25 years			1
@entity47 completely by hand , the idea for the project first came about after he was gifted an original blanket handed to a rescued passenger when the ship sunk in 1912			1
mr @entity7 was at a library researching a family who had been on the @entity13 when an elderly man sitting next to him recognised the name of a survivor he was reading about - @entity56			1
the same name was printed on an old blanket that the man unwittingly had at home - which he had acquired through inheritance			0
as soon as the man mentioned the link , mr @entity7 offered to buy the blanket			2
speaking about the various trinkets he has collected over the years , he said ' it 's history - i buy it all because it 's close to my heart mr @entity7 said : ' he said i could have it			2

' the blanket was heavily stained and in a state of disrepair but has since been professionally cleaned			0

' mr @entity7 has spent thousands of pounds renovating the lean - to ( pictured left ) after being inspired by the gift of a blanket ( right ) which was originally given to a survivor of the @entity13 upon being rescued mr @entity7 has since researched the story of @entity56 - the woman who first owned the blanket			1
she had been married to @entity101 - nephew of @entity102 of @entity103 - who died when the ship sank in 1912			0
mrs @entity56 had been one of the lucky ones to get a space on a lifeboat and was ultimately rescued by the crew of the @entity110			0
many of the items found in the renovated shed have come from the @entity13 's sister liner , the @entity41 people were given blankets to prevent and combat hypothermia and mrs @entity56 kept this with her for the rest of her life			1
after she died , her blanket was inherited by the anonymous man who @entity7 met in the library			2
unaware of its significance , he was close to throwing the blanket away before @entity7 offered to buy it			2
