by @entity0 published : 12:35 est , 9 april 2012 updated : 20:14 est , 9 april 2012 supermarkets have seen a massive drop in the use of plastic bags when they charge for them , it emerged yesterday			1
since a 5p levy was introduced across @entity9 last year , @entity7 ’s has reported a 90 per cent reduction in their use there			0
co-op says it has seen a fall of 86 per cent , while @entity14 is down 60 per cent			0
a thing of the past ? the 5p ' bag tax ' appears to be changing shoppers ' habits as they ditch disposable bags like these for reusable options the major supermarkets ’ figures suggest the policy has led to a huge reduction in the 350million plastic bags previously used annually in @entity9 supermarkets			1
it is a major victory for the @entity31 ’s @entity30 campaign , which was launched in 2008 and received enormous support from readers , anti-litter campaigners , the @entity35 , the @entity36 and many other groups			1
in @entity9 , shops are now legally bound to enforce a 5p charge – and then pass on the cash to charities			1
scourge : the effects of disposable bag use are plain to see on the banks of the @entity46 , near @entity47 , @entity48 shops that continue to provide free carrier bags face a fine of up to £ 5,000			0
the success of the @entity9 initiative is bound to increase pressure on @entity55 to ‘ banish the bags ’ as shoppers switch to bags - for - life to cut down on waste			2
from next year shoppers will have to pay 5p for their plastic bags in @entity63 , increasing to 10p in 2014 , while @entity64 is considering a similar plan			1
ministers are understood to be considering adopting a charge throughout @entity55 amid evidence that voluntary measures by stores have failed to deliver promised reductions			2
plastic bags are often used only for about 20 minutes , but take up to 1,000 years to rot away , littering the landscape and causing devastation to marine animals and birds , which suffer long painful deaths after ingesting or becoming entangled in them			0
the @entity31 launched its @entity30 campaign four years ago after the @entity31 launched its @entity30 campaign four years ago , @entity80 introduced a 5p charge on all food carrier bags , prompting a huge drop in the number handed out to customers			2
but last year , large retailers in the @entity87 gave out 6.4billion carrier bags , an increase of 333million in a year			1
@entity90 has said the recent increase is unacceptable and has warned retailers that government intervention to reduce numbers is possible			0
last month it emerged that a ban on free plastic bags across the whole of @entity98 is being considered by @entity99			0
the way forward : more customers are opting for reusable cotton bags , while @entity80 set an example with their own decision to charge 5p per bag			0

pressure mounts on the rest of the @entity87 to follow suit after major supermarkets show *remarkable* results
income from the charge has already raised *hundreds* of *thousands* for charity
@entity63 is next in line
