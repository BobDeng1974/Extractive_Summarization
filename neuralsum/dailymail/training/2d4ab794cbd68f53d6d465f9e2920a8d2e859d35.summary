@entity5 , 51 , and @entity6 , 55 , advertised fake cars on websites including @entity9 and made potential buyers pay upfront for cars which never arrived			1
they were jailed this week at @entity14 for the fraud , which they used to fund their life of luxury			1
@entity5 ( left ) pleaded guilty to fraud and @entity6 ( right ) to money laundering @entity21 pleaded guilty to fraud , and was jailed for four years , while @entity22 pleaded guilty to money laundering and received a sentence of eight months			1
the couple , from @entity26 , @entity27 , using a string of false names , and would agree prices with buyers over the internet			0
they even arranged deliveries of the cars - which would never arrive			2
@entity22 would then make excuses to their angry victims , before eventually ending contact altogether			2
the money from the fake cars funded them ‘ living the high life ’ in luxury rented homes and hotels			1
they spent months on the run , leaving a trail of unpaid bills and furious customers			0
the coucple used the website for @entity53 to con used car buyers the fraud began with a company the pair founded called @entity58 , which offered vehicles in the @entity61 area and made them £ 46,891			2
they listed their non-existent cars in the specialist section of the @entity66 website , where it is common practice for buyers to pay up front for cars			2
even after police arrested the couple in july last year , they brazenly set up another fraudulent website , @entity53 , while on bail , claiming they ’ will not be beaten on price , quality and service ’			0
the site said : ' for fantastic offers and great choice @entity53 is your number one secondhand car dealer			2
' here at @entity53 we pride ourselves on sourcing and offering a fantastic range of cars to suit every need and pocket			2
' then in october and november of last year they returned to @entity9 , and pulled off six more bogus sales for between £ 4,500 and £ 10,500			0
they went on the run before being arrested again in @entity94 this may			0
they claimed to be legitimate traders with years of experience after the sentencing , detective constable @entity98 of @entity99 said : ‘ victims of this crime lived all over the @entity103 and have been left out of pocket by these people			1
‘ this couple took advantage of the trust that most motor dealers place on each other and have left many feeling like they committed a schoolboy error			0
‘ they were living the high life staying in luxury houses and hotels all paid for by the money they stole			1
’ @entity5 and @entity22 agreed price online and arranged deliveries , but the cars did not exist but police believe the fraud could have been even larger than expected , as many victims may not yet have come forward			1
in an appeal released while the pair were on the run , a spokesman said : ‘ the fraud has been carried out systematically and there are probably victims out there that we are not aware of			0
it is a large amount of money and that ’s just what we know about			0
this might be the tip of the iceberg			0
‘ cars were advertised via the trader ’s section of @entity9 , and apparently it is quite common for traders to ask for payment up front			1
because it is through the traders ’ section there is a degree of trust			0
‘ it could be that there are more victims and people might not have come forward through embarrassment , because there ’s some degree of error on the victim ’s part for paying up front for goods they have not received			1
’ auto trader said it advises all customers not to part with cash until they have seen the vehicle , and to carry out thorough checks on the vehicle before agreeing to a deal .			0
