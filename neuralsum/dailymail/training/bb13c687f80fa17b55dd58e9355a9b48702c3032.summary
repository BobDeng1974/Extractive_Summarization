on your marks ... one week to go before the hold button is pressed on normal life			0
seven days of dreams and expectation followed by a month of ecstasy , agony , and the tricky job of fitting in three games a day round sleeping and eating and doing the occasional bit of work			0
so here are ten reasons why the @entity16 could be the best , yet			1
well – @entity17 ( the place ) , obviously the land of coffee , smiley beautiful people and samba football			1
it would be hard to pick a more glamorous host nation			0
no kid grows up wanting to play for @entity26 ( unless you ’re @entity28 , of course )			0
every kid ( even @entity28 ) wants to be @entity31			0
tricks and flicks are copyright @entity17 , after all			1
the stage is set : two @entity36 icons , the @entity38 statue and the @entity39 , venue for the @entity16 final on july 13 finishing touches : a sand sculpture marks the start of the @entity16 on @entity45 in @entity36 up for grabs : the famous @entity16 trophy next to the @entity49 ball on the pitch at the @entity39 @entity51 with all the furore over the @entity56 - @entity55 rivalry , it has been easy to overlook the @entity17 with the dodgy haircut , who has had an up - and - down season at @entity59			1
only now he is back home , a stage on which he has tended to excel			0
the signs are that @entity17 will play a pragmatic game			1
big @entity66 is not a flamboyant manager			0
but @entity51 has a box of tricks at his disposal and the tendency to do his own thing			1
should be fun to watch			0
back home : @entity17 's @entity51 is predicted to be the star of the @entity16 shine a light : the @entity59 star is a stylish @entity17 player in a pragmatic team led by @entity66 @entity56 v @entity55 difficult to ignore but the constant comparison of @entity81 ’s @entity80 and @entity59 ’s @entity82 is beginning to wear a little thin			1
the common perception is that @entity56 has had a disappointing season when the truth is that he has not had a stand - out one			1
@entity87 has a @entity89 medal and will be looking for as many reasons as possible to rip off his shirt and display his six pack to the world			0
he does know he will get booked , does n’t he ? @entity95 turn : @entity56 knows it 's time to perform on the greatest stage for @entity99 put your shirt on him : we 're bound to see more of @entity55 's six pack during the @entity16 no vuvuzelas and no @entity106 band an over-riding memory of @entity108 four years ago was the loud ( ok , deafening ) sound of a million angry hornets courtesy of the vuvuzela			1
@entity112 decided that this year ’s official ‘ noise maker ’ would be a caxirola – for sale at all good @entity16 outlets			1
there is just one flaw			0
the caxirola has been banned from all 12 stadiums because it doubles up as an aerodynamic missile			0
still , it ’s not all bad news because the ban on anything musical means the @entity106 brass band is silenced for the first time since @entity128 1998			1
silenced : we will at least be spared the infernal racket of the vuvuzela out in @entity17 not today , thank you : the @entity106 band will be absent from the tournament after the ban on musical instruments @entity137 i know			1
@entity106 coaches tend not to be flavour of the month during big tournaments but @entity137 has brought reality to the whole crazy national expectation			2
he talks sense , does not give a damn how he is portrayed in the media and it looks like he has convinced the players too			0
lest we forget , this is a man who was drummed out of @entity152 because he was not regarded as ‘ big enough ’ for @entity153 and , supposedly , the players			0
the @entity156 mob with @entity106 seem fine with him			2
unfazed : @entity137 leads @entity106 into the @entity16 with expectations pretty low the 3 cs – @entity45 , @entity159 , @entity160 bare - footed boys playing football on the sand , watched by bikini - clad beauties			1
it can mean only one thing – welcome to the @entity45			2
here ’s a prediction ... we ’ll be seeing a lot of the most famous stretch of beach in the world over the next month			0
here ’s another prediction , just like @entity175 ’s at @entity176 , @entity106 ’s hostelries are likely to be offering the deadly caipirinha – a cocktail with a sting in the tail			2
to those lucky enough to be out there , coxinha - a deep - fried chicken and cheese delight – is the equivalent of your meat and potato pie			0
@entity17 dream : a local player perfects his bicycle kicks on the soft sand of @entity45 in @entity36 golden days : a game of football in progress on @entity196 in @entity36 , with the silhouette of @entity199 mountain in the background @entity201 no stranger to our screens at @entity16 time but the @entity208 host ’s wonderfully laconic style tends to set the tone for the rest of the @entity212 team			1
he ’s been there and done it as a player and he ’s been there and done it as presenter			2
as an added bonus , he will be tweeting too			0
laconic : @entity201 will be fronting the @entity212 's coverage of the @entity16 no wags it might be two @entity224 ago now , but the image of @entity226 is not yet erased from the memory banks			1
footballers ’ wives do nothing for a football tournament other than act as magnets for paparazzi			2
taking the missus / mister to work tends not to go down that well in most jobs and that ’s what the @entity106 team are doing , after all			2
never again : @entity241 out and about in @entity226 , @entity26 during the 2006 @entity16 @entity31 three - time winner , four - time finalist , the greatest player to grace the game			1
and the @entity16 will be in his manor , which means lots of excuses to show nostalgia clips of the ‘ old days ’			2
@entity31 in his pomp will be a reminder to the new generation just how high he set the bar			0
legend : we 'll hopefully be seeing plenty of @entity31 when the tournament kicks off in @entity17 @entity259 @entity224 are all about fairytales and no - one deserves a happy ending like the @entity106 and @entity153 skipper			1
this is likely to be his last tournament and only the coming weeks will show whether the effort – mental and physical – of last season will prove too much for the midfielder			0
but whatever happens to @entity106 , let ’s hope @entity259 flies home with his head held high			2
captain , leader ... will there be a fairytale ending for @entity259 and @entity106 at the @entity16 ?			1

playing in a @entity17 @entity16 is a dream come true for every player
@entity51 has the potential to gain *immortality* by guiding hosts to glory
@entity56 vs @entity55 rivalry will reach new heights
@entity106 enter the tournament with low expectations
there will be no vuvuzelas or wags , just the @entity45 and cocktails
