new drug : @entity1 can extend life by more than six months , but has been turned down by @entity3 women are to be denied a revolutionary new drug for breast cancer on the @entity7 – the eighth such treatment to be turned down in three years			1
the rationing watchdog will confirm today that it will block routine use of the drug – which can extend life by more than six months – for those with the most aggressive form of the disease			1
experts reacted with dismay to the decision , which means that eight consecutive therapies for advanced breast cancer have now been turned down since 2011 because of the cost			1
@entity1 is the first medicine designed to attack cancer cells while dramatically reducing side - effects such as hair loss			1
the treatment costs almost £ 6,000 a month , totalling £ 90,000 for 15 months treatment , which the @entity3 ( @entity3 ) insists is too expensive			2
the @entity7 was offered a discount scheme by manufacturers @entity28 , but @entity3 wanted the price cut by 60 per cent			1
@entity28 said yesterday it would appeal the decision , which it said showed the system was ‘ not fit for purpose ’ and would put @entity35 breast cancer treatment behind that of other countries in @entity38			1
dr @entity40 from the firm said : ‘ despite @entity28 offering a significant discount we are once again disappointed that @entity3 has not shown any flexibility on access to @entity1 , a drug with qualities that @entity3 chief executive sir @entity48 described on live television as “ impressive ”			1
@entity3 ’s decision to block the routine use of @entity1 has been condemned by @entity57 , professor of cancer medicine at @entity58 , @entity59			1
he led trials for the drug in the @entity35 which were funded by drug manufacturer @entity28			0
professor @entity57 said the drug ’s special mode of action – which seeks out and destroys cancerous cells while sparing healthy tissue from unnecessary damage – made it a ‘ truly revolutionary drug ’			0
he added that @entity3 ’s rejection was ‘ a real blow ’ to women with advanced breast cancer			1
professor @entity57 said : ‘ for the first time in 20 years as a consultant i ’m seeing people with advanced disease taking an effective drug with little toxicity			0
the two do n’t usually go together			0
‘ @entity1 tackles the disease in a different way to any other breast cancer medicine and provides women with valuable extra time with their families and loved ones – time that you can not put a price on			1
‘ @entity1 is able to deliver significantly increased efficacy to patients without the toxic side - effects associated with potent chemotherapy drugs – ultimately meaning that patients can live for longer with a better quality of life			1
this is achieved through the innovative way that @entity1 works			2
because its action is so precise , a normally toxic form of chemotherapy can be used but healthy tissue is spared from unnecessary damage			0
‘ it represents a significant step forward in the fight against a particularly aggressive and notoriously difficult - to - treat form of the disease			0
@entity3 ’s decision not to fund the drug for routine @entity7 use serves as a real blow for all those involved			1
‘ while patients in @entity117 can access the drug via the @entity119 , we need to work towards a solution to ensure long - term access to this truly revolutionary drug			2
’ ‘ refusing patients access to this drug is an incredible injustice and tantamount to turning the clock back in cancer research and development			2
we plan to appeal this decision , ’ dr @entity40 added			0
@entity1 – also called @entity1 – combines the original ‘ wonder ’ drug herceptin with a potent chemotherapy agent which acts only when it reaches cancer cells			1
it attaches to tumour cells and blocks signals that encourage the cancer to grow and spread			0
it then breaches the outer defences of the cell and releases a payload of chemotherapy to destroy it from within			0
because its action is so precise , healthy tissue is spared from unnecessary damage			0
at the same time the cancer is delayed from returning and side - effects from chemotherapy such as diarrhoea and hair loss are significantly reduced			1
trial results show it provides six months ’ extra life on average , but some women having once - monthly infusions are living far longer			0
up to 1,500 women a year in @entity35 with @entity157 positive breast cancer that has spread could benefit			1
the decision by @entity3 means the drug will not be transferred to the @entity7 budget			1
patients in @entity117 can still apply to get it from the @entity119 set up to fund medicines not routinely available on the @entity7			2
but the @entity119 does not work elsewhere in the @entity35 , and is due to be wound up in 2016			0
dr @entity163 , clinical director of charity @entity164 , said : ‘ @entity1 being rejected from routine @entity7 access will come as another devastating blow to women with @entity157 positive advanced breast cancer , denying them the chance of a longer and much better quality of life			1
‘ @entity3 , the @entity172 and the pharmaceutical industry must work together to identify a new way forward that takes into account both human and economic impact			2
’ @entity3 chief executive sir @entity48 said : ‘ although @entity28 proposed a discount , it made little difference to its value for money , leaving it well above the top of our specially extended range of cost effectiveness for cancer drugs			1
‘ we are really disappointed that @entity28 were not able to demonstrate more flexibility to help us make a positive recommendation			0
the company is well aware that we could not have recommend @entity1 at the price it proposed			2
’ @entity191 has been granted precious extra time with her four children thanks to @entity1			0
mrs @entity191 , 33 , was told she had advanced breast cancer in july 2011 , after months of being misdiagnosed			1
by this time the cancer had spread to her liver and she was told she had just eight months to live			0
at first she was given two courses of chemotherapy , but she said the brutal treatment ‘ stripped her out ’			0
she lost her hair and suffered many side - effects			1
minimal side - effects : mother @entity191 was given eight months to live in july 2011 , but has now survived long enough to complete six cycles of @entity1 she was moved on to different chemotherapy but again suffered severe side - effects , developing cracks in her feet that prevented her from walking			1
mrs @entity191 , who lives in @entity209 with husband @entity48 and her children aged 13 to three years , then heard about @entity1 and insisted on a second opinion at a @entity213 cancer centre			2
it was approved through the @entity119 in february			0
she is on her sixth cycle of the drug and the tumours on her liver and lungs are now stable			0
she said : ‘ i ’ve had minimal side - effects			2
we ’ve had a really nice summer with the kids and been to @entity224 @entity223			0
i could n’t have done that on the other drugs			0
‘ i do n’t know how long i ’ve got , it ’s incurable but i feel well and every month is a bonus			0
’ she said she is devastated by the @entity3 decision to deny women like her the chance to have the drug			2
‘ these decisions seem to be made without emotion , but that ’s what ’s important , ’ she added .			0
