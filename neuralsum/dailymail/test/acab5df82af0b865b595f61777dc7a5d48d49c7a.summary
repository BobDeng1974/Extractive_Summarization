a remarkable farming couple have devoted their lives to adopting disabled orphans - taking in more than 40 children over the last 26 years			1
@entity5 , 65 , and his wife @entity6 , 60 , found their first child in a box on the roadside and gradually took more and more disabled children into their two - bedroom home in rural @entity14 province , central @entity15			1
but the couple have faced a great deal of heartache over the years , and are only now living comfortably with 12 of the children with the help of donations by kind - hearted people , according to the @entity23			2
big family : @entity5 and his wife @entity6 have adopted 40 disabled children over the past 26 years			1
nine of the children can be seen here , enjoying a family meal together working hard : the @entity29 can now afford to send their children to school , but it has n't always been this way the couple , who live outside of @entity35 , found their first child - a baby girl - on the side of the road one day in 1989 and carried her home , despite not having much to live on themselves			1
@entity5 said he immediately felt an emotional connection with the child : ' this baby girl was in a cardboard box			1
she was so tiny and skinny			0
both of her legs were weird and you could tell at first glance that she was disabled			0
' ' when i saw this baby girl , i felt like i had been through the same things			1
’ difficult life : all of the children were disabled and many had been abandoned by their biological parents devoted : @entity5 says he was desperate to help and began to take more and more children into their home ever - growing : the couple said that even the local authorities began sending children to their home he suffers from a genetic eye condition , and says that this made him desperately want to help disabled children			1
eventually , nearly 20 children were sleeping on the floor in their 20 square metre farmhouse			0
the couple themselves had barely any space to lie down			0
they would take it in turn to wake up three or four times every night to feed the babies and change their nappies			0
the couple did not even have a washing machine , and @entity6 was forced her laundry in icy water that was often -20 degrees @entity80			0
even the local authorities began to send disabled children to the @entity29 , but unfortunately the government subsidy for foster parents only covered the cost of milk powder			1
the couple gradually used up all their savings , making them fear for the future of their children			2
caring : @entity5 , feeding one of the babies above , found a baby girl in a box on the side of the road grief : sadly nine of the children died			1
the parents still visit their tombs to carry out religious rituals the children needed constant medical treatment , which became extremely expensive			0
the couple went with various children to the doctor twice a week and every day during flu season			2
the healthiest child had a cleft lip and palate			0
sadly , nine of the children died and another 12 were adopted by other families			1
none of their neighbours were willing to help and it became too much for the eldest son - who decided to get up and leave			0
but a short online film telling the story of the @entity29 has changed their lives forever			0
the documentary called ' fading flowers ’ gained a huge amount of support and nearly £ 14,000 was raised to buy the family a new 500 square metre home			0
the children have also been able to receive proper medical treatment , and five of them have had their disabilities corrected			0
today , the couple have 12 children living with them - the eldest is 16 , and the youngest is 6			2
@entity6 said it 's all been worth it : ' as long as we live , we will care for the children			2
’ happier times : 12 children still live with the couple and can now receive proper treatment due to generous donations from the public new home : a short film telling the family 's story received tremendous support online , raising £ 14,000 good education : the couple still hope to send the children to school in the city			1
