by @entity0 published : 11:12 est , 2 may 2012 updated : 18:10 est , 2 may 2012 @entity1 stressed that the possibility the second part of the inquiry may not go ahead has not affected his approach to the first part @entity1 yesterday hinted he may ditch the second part of his inquiry into the @entity8 , which was due to look specifically at @entity10 phone hacking			1
he said waiting for the conclusion of any potential criminal trials meant it would be ‘ very many months , if not longer ’ before his inquiry could begin			2
he suggested consideration should be given to the value of his investigation , which he said would involve ‘ enormous cost ’ to the taxpayer and would simply ‘ trawl over ’ previously heard material			1
although he did not rule out pressing ahead as planned , @entity1 said it was ‘ in everyone ’s interests ’ to allow the first part of his inquiry to go ‘ as far as it possibly can ’ in case the second part is abandoned			1
when the prime minister announced the inquiry , at the height of the controversy over phone hacking in 2011 , he said @entity1 should conduct his investigation in two parts			1
the first was to examine the ‘ culture , practices and ethics ’ of the media , including contacts and relationships between the press , politicians and police , and make recommendations for a new regulatory regime			2
@entity45 at the @entity46 last week			0
when @entity47 commissioned the probe in the wake of revelations about phone - hacking at the @entity10 in july 2011 , he gave @entity1 a remit to carry out an inquiry in two parts the second was to investigate the ‘ extent of unlawful or improper conduct within @entity57 , other newspaper organisations and , as appropriate , other organisations within the media ’			1
@entity62 mp @entity61 , whose phone was hacked , told @entity64 's @entity65 : ' all i ever wanted ... was an inquiry into what went on at the @entity10 ' it would also look at allegations of corrupt payments to police and allegations that the police failed to respond properly to the initial phone hacking allegations			2
last night @entity77 , a lawyer acting for some of the hacking victims , said : ‘ it would seem very likely that , in the course of the ongoing criminal proceedings , much of the evidence as to unlawful or improper conduct at @entity57 will be addressed and findings made			0
in those circumstances , it would make at least aspects of any part two redundant			0
’ the board of @entity91 last night dismissed claims by members of the @entity94 that @entity45 is ‘ not fit ’ to run his global media empire			0
their unanimous vote of confidence came as @entity62 and the @entity98 piled pressure on broadcasting regulator @entity100 to speed up a report on whether mr @entity45 is a ‘ fit and proper person ’ to control @entity102			0
@entity100 yesterday insisted it would not be ‘ rushed into a knee - jerk reaction ’ .			0

lord @entity1 : ' a *[* further *]* inquiry will involve yet more enormous cost , both to the public purse and the *participants* '
