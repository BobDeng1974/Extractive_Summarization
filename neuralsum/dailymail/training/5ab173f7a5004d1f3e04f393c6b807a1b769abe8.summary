two @entity1 agents on president @entity3 's detail has been reprimanded after trying to force himself into a woman 's hotel room to collect a bullet that he had left there after meeting her hours before in the hotel bar			1
@entity11 , who works as a senior supervisor in charge of more than 20 agents , was investigated by his superiors after a hotel staffer reported his unusual behavior			0
the ensuing investigation also found that he and another agent , @entity19 , were sending sexually suggestive emails to a female subordinate			1
both men have now been suspended from the @entity1 and the incident remains under investigation			0
scandal prone : the latest @entity1 incident happened in may of this year when an agent ( not one of those pictured above ) tried to get a bullet that he left in a woman 's hotel room scene : the agent was off duty when he met the woman in the bar of the @entity36 just one block from the @entity38 and he spent time with her in her hotel room the latest scandal comes a year after the agency came under fire when one agent got into an argument with a prostitute in @entity46 and a dozen others became involved with the incident and resulting cover up			1
the @entity49 has revealed that the backlash that resulted from the @entity52 scandal was not enough to scare the @entity1 agents straight because this latest incident took place in may of this year			0
the may incident began when @entity11 met a woman in the bar of the @entity36 and they went back to her hotel room			1
the @entity36 is a luxury hotel located just one block from the @entity38 , making it â€™s bar a popular hangout for agents and other government workers			2
the president and his family has also stayed there , and he hosted a dinner there earlier this year when he was trying to reach out to @entity69 over budget negotiations			0
brushing past it : the report says that the agency does not have institutional issues but just problems with certain agents who were found to solicit prostitutes and drink with locals while prepping for presidential visits close : one of the two agents who is the subject of the investigation was a favorite of former first lady @entity84 ( seen here with other agents in 2002 and not necessarily @entity87 , who is the one from the latest scandal ) during the ensuing investigation , @entity11 took the bullets out of the state - issued gun that he had with him even though he was off duty			2
when he left later that night , he realized that he had left one bullet inside the room and asked her to let him back in			2
the woman , who has not been identified , would not allow him back in so he went down to the front desk of the hotel identifying himself as a @entity1 agent and asking to be let into the room			1
the clerk at the desk thought that the request seemed strange and the hotel contacted the @entity38 to report the suspicious behavior			0
officials then launched a probe into @entity11 's activity and read through his emails on his government - issued @entity111 where they found that he and @entity19 had been sending sexually suggestive emails to another @entity1 employee			1
international incident : in may 2012 , a @entity1 agent who was in @entity46 ahead of the president 's visit to the country got into an altercation with a prostitute woman in the middle : @entity125 was identified as the prostitute involved in the @entity128 scandal the @entity49 says that the female agent 's name has not been revealed because she has not be reprimanded in connection to the emails			1
' we have always maintained that the @entity1 has a professional and dedicated workforce , ' @entity1 spokesman @entity133 told the paper			0
' periodically we have isolated incidents of misconduct , just like every organization does			0
' @entity11 has been pulled from his position , while @entity19 has been moved off the detail to a separate part of the division , people familiar with the case told the @entity49			0
@entity19 was given the prestigious promotion to the president 's detail four years ago , but @entity11 has had close contact with the first family for longer			1
restoring trust : even new @entity1 head @entity152 thinks that the report is flawed since it is based on an anonymous survey of agents who were effectively asked to report ' rumors and gossip ' before being added to the president 's detail himself , the @entity49 reports that he was in charge of the agency 's @entity162 office and then returned to the @entity164 and was tasked with leading @entity84 's detail while her husband was president			1
in her memoir , mrs @entity84 specifically thanks mr @entity11 for keeping her safe in the aftermath of the september 11 attacks			0
the new investigation was revealed as part of an inspector general report that began in the wake of the @entity128 scandal which lead to the then - director to step down			0
president @entity3 then promoted @entity152 to head the agency , making her the first ever female director of the department .			2

@entity1 supervisor @entity87 has been removed from the president 's detail following an altercation at the @entity36 in @entity182
he met a woman at the bar when he was off duty and went back to her hotel room and *emptied* the bullets from his gun while inside
when he left , he realized that he left a bullet and tried getting back in
hotel staff *alerted* the @entity1 and they began investigating him
found that he and another agent , @entity19 , were sending sexually suggestive emails to a female subordinate
now @entity19 has also been put in a different division of the *service*
comes more than a year after a different agent got in a fight with a prostitute over a *fee* while in @entity46 ahead of president @entity3 's visit
