@entity1 executives were seriously divided at their meeting in @entity3 over @entity6 ’s @entity5 corruption report , despite their later pretence that there was unanimous support for publication of the document			1
some @entity13 members were upset @entity6 mentioned in his resignation statement that the 25 - strong committee had reported him to the @entity1 disciplinary committee for breaking ethics rules after he spoke out in favour of transparency around his findings			1
then @entity22 ’s @entity21 , one of three @entity13 members under investigation over @entity5 bid conduct , astonished colleagues in @entity27 by admitting he alone had made the complaint about @entity6 and wanted the minutes altered accordingly			2
@entity6 's report into the @entity5 bidding process has divided @entity1 whatever the findings of the report , the @entity31 will go ahead in @entity34 only @entity36 's health can prevent the @entity1 president from running for another term @entity40 @entity39 , one of the @entity1 modernisers , also ensured previous @entity13 meeting minutes were changed to reflect that a number of the committee had wanted full publication from the start — which he felt president @entity36 had not made clear			1
meanwhile , @entity36 ’s health is now the only factor likely to stop him standing for a ludicrous fifth term			0
and @entity36 , 79 in march , is said to be ‘ invigorated ’ by persuading the @entity13 to accept full publication of the @entity6 report			2
a split exco on this issue would have made life very difficult for him before the election in may			0
certainly the relentless global travel to prop up his support does not seem to be weakening him			0
@entity36 told @entity61 that his entourage feel the pace more than him			0
@entity65 presenter @entity64 has been approached about becoming president of @entity67 @entity70 's new @entity69 - based ownership consortium have approached soccer saturday presenter @entity64 , who promotes his team at every opportunity , to become president			1
and the @entity65 man ’s acceptance of the ambassador role is sure to go down better with supporters than convicted rapist @entity80 being linked with the @entity82 ’s bottom club			2
the @entity13 may have agreed to publish — where possible — the full @entity6 report into @entity5 bid corruption but the governing body are braced for the @entity40 lawyer , who has resigned from his @entity1 ethics role , to have plenty to say			1
his explosive missives , which could derail @entity1 at any time , come via his @entity91 law firm in @entity92 without warning			2
there is obviously something very wrong with the way the @entity98 nurture talent when friends say 21 - year - old @entity100 , who was the @entity102 boys ’ champion just three years ago , now intends to quit the sport			1
@entity100 , a former @entity102 boys ' singles champion , is considering leaving the sport @entity105 's qatar love in @entity110 's racecourse ’s extraordinary , decade - long festival sponsorship with the @entity111 , worth at least £ 2.5million a year , highlights the contrast between football ’s suspicion about @entity34 ’s @entity5 bid and the way @entity118 racing has embraced the country ’s massive patronage			1
@entity122 chairman @entity121 said the @entity110 deal transcended racing and was great for @entity118 sport and trade			2
but @entity121 also summed up racing ’s insular culture when he said football ’s difficulties in accepting the wholly unsuitable @entity34 as a @entity5 stage was a ‘ bit like a sideshow ’			0
@entity110 launched their @entity34 association at the top of @entity136 ’s @entity135 , which is also owned by the money - no - object @entity34			0
@entity110 has struck up a lucrative festival deal in association with the money no object @entity34 @entity140 , the tv rights wizard behind the last five @entity143 auctions , has left @entity144 to set up another company — @entity146 — having previously sold @entity147 to @entity144 three years ago			1
but the combative @entity140 will still be acting as chief adviser to @entity143 ceo @entity149 in the current tender , which could bring £ 10m a game and nearly £ 5bn overall			0
the manifesto of secondary ticket - selling firm @entity156 effectively describes culture secretary @entity157 and minister for sport @entity158 as ‘ our slippery representatives in @entity162 ’ , adding that @entity156 has ‘ no intention of slithering out of our manifesto promise ’			0
this is the same @entity156 who are strongly lobbying mps to ditch proposals added by peers to the @entity170 that will protect fans from internet touts .			0

@entity6 's @entity5 corruption report has divided @entity1
@entity176 have approached @entity65 presenter @entity64 about becoming the club 's president
