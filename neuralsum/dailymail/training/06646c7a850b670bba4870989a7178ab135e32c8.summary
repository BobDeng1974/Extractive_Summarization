by @entity0 @entity1 is n’t the first so - called luxury player to find himself edged towards the periphery of a new manager ’s plans			1
yet the attacking midfielder ’s current plight at @entity8 is unique in two senses			1
firstly , @entity1 is the reigning @entity11 and @entity12 player of the year			1
lifting those two individual prizes in may hardly taxed him to the point of exhaustion			0
secondly , it almost always follows that a manager believes he can make do without the talent of such a player because he has others in the team who will compensate			2
@entity38 ? no track record whatsoever at that level			0
had @entity22 been able to call upon a seasoned @entity43 9 capable of playing the lone striker role at that level to good effect , commons ’ omission would have been less glaring			0
similarly , had his fellow @entity48 seemed capable of providing the offensive spark commons showed in the corresponding fixture against @entity51 a year ago , there would not have been such a kerfuffle			2
but of the four forward thinking players @entity22 started with , only the ever - improving @entity54 looked a decent bet to hit the @entity56 where it hurt			2
with such a powderpuff look to the attack , little wonder @entity58 was @entity22 ’s most potent threat in the final third , with that only materialising in the dying embers of the match			0
nightmare : last year 's @entity11 and @entity12 player of the year did not even start against @entity28 last week it begs the question – what exactly has commons done wrong ? the answer though is very little – aside from having a face that seemingly does n’t fit into the manager ’s preferred 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 model			1
the tacit message @entity22 ’s team selection spelled out against @entity28 was that if you are n’t prepared to run , press and scrap to retrieve the ball in the final third like your life depends on it , then it ’s going to be a struggle to accommodate you			0
@entity22 will argue that he has n’t yet cast the 30 - year - old on the scrapheap			1
given he has featured to some degree in all bar one of @entity8 ’s nine competitive games this season , his argument holds some water			1
but it ’s the game - time afforded to the former @entity97 international in the past three matches – or rather the lack of it - that has given rise to the notion that he ’s increasingly surplus to requirements			2
an unused sub in @entity28 last week , @entity1 had the dubious privilege of playing the entire 90 minutes at @entity109 last saturday – a day for the jersey - fillers , if ever there was one			1
his worst fears were confirmed an hour and a half before kick - off on tuesday – another place on the bench - and eventually a replacement it would transpire for @entity119 at the half - way point			2
exit : commons could be heading for the exit with @entity124 , @entity125 and @entity126 all interested @entity127 yesterday revealed that that player is considering his future as a result of the latest demotion – and it ’s believed he sought an explanation from @entity22 on the night			1
he is unlikely to have been comforted by what he heard			0
now in the last year of his contract , the 30 - year - old ’s thoughts are no longer about securing the long - term extension – with one foot in the coaching camp - that was muted last season			1
unless matters change radically , the temptation to explore options back in @entity143 even before monday ’s transfer deadline may prove tempting			0
if he does go either now or in january ( @entity126 , @entity125 and @entity124 are all watching the situation ) there will be much angst among the fans			1
upon signing for @entity8 from @entity151 for £ 300,000 in january 2011 , @entity1 scored 15 goals in half a season			1
form : despite some poor sspells , @entity1 has matured with age , and managed 30 goals last season the following term – his very own annus horribilis – saw him hit the net just once and face - off with humour rumours of a bust - up with @entity164 by training in bandages and a neck brace			1
it proved to be no more than a blip : in 2012 - 13 he hit 19 goals then smashed 31 last term to sweep up the individual awards			0
statistics that suggest he ’s a ‘ luxury player ’ well worth making allowances for			0
commons may be a yard shy in pace of ever being classed as absolutely top drawer but , despite his retirement from @entity97 duty last year , he remains an international class footballer			0
together with @entity58 and @entity184 , he is the closest thing @entity8 have to a star man these days			2
@entity22 ’s devotion to his system and insistence upon boundless energy is admirable to a degree but when it ’s so slavish that a player of commons ’ ilk can not be accommodated within it questions are naturally asked			0
if the player is handed another watching brief at @entity197 on sunday , he will at least feel he has the answer to the most pressing query in his mind			0
with the transfer window closing the following evening , he may be of a view to seek a swift resolution to a growing problem .			0

@entity1 could be on his way out of @entity8
@entity25 does n't seem too keen on the @entity11 and @entity12 player of the year
@entity124 , @entity126 and @entity125 all keeping tabs on the 30 - year - old
