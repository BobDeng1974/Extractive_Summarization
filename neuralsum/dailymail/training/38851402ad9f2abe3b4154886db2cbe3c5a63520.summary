by @entity0 @entity1 has issued a defiant response to the perception in @entity4 that @entity5 will be lambs to the slaughter by declaring : ‘ we are not a rubbish team			1
’ @entity10 ’s tourists have been installed as 16/1 underdogs by local bookmakers for saturday ’s first test in @entity14 , with an expectant public eager to toast a resounding @entity4 victory			1
the statistics make for frightening reading			2
@entity4 are chasing a 15th successive victory , have won every match at @entity21 since 1994 and have lost just once since lifting the @entity22 in 2011			1
defiant response : @entity1 insists @entity4 should give @entity5 respect ahead of the first test in contrast , @entity5 are hamstrung here by the absence of key players from @entity31 finalists @entity32 and @entity33 , and an injury list that has accounted for four @entity35			1
it is against this backdrop that the tourists are being billed as victims in waiting , but may insists saturday ’s outcome is no foregone conclusion			1
‘ we have nothing to lose but at the same time we have great players in our team , ’ said the @entity43 wing			2
‘ we are going forward as a team			2
we are not a rubbish team , we have good principles , we have good structures and everyone is buying into that			1
we are a tough outfit to play against for anyone , irrespective of the new players that have come in , because of the culture we have created as a team and the way we play			1
it is easy for players to jump into it			2
‘ we are underdogs for this game			2
people have written us off but that ’s not an excuse			0
we put pressure on ourselves , we want a performance and we will go out there and give it everything			0
' @entity5 experienced mixed fortunes on tuesday with the news influential @entity4 @entity75 will miss the first test due to concussion being offset by @entity79 ’ absence from training once again			1
the loss of @entity82 , the @entity83 ’s player of the year , will be keenly felt while a doubt hangs over prolific @entity4 wing @entity85 , who is struggling with a knee injury			1
ruled out : @entity75 ( left ) will miss saturday 's first test with @entity5 after suffering with concussion @entity5 have been gifted their team talk for saturday ’s first test after blundering @entity4 @entity92 failed to correctly name a member of @entity10 ’s squad			1
asked if he knew any of the tourists , @entity92 responded ‘ a couple ’			0
when pressed for a name , the second row said ‘ @entity99 ’			0
@entity92 was referring to @entity100 , who is unavailable			0
@entity5 will find the gaffe galling as @entity92 was in the @entity4 side that lost 38 - 21 @entity103 in 2012			1
@entity5 ’s plans have been disrupted yet again with @entity79 ’ inability to take part in the final session before @entity109 names his team tomorrow night			1
the 25 - year - old from @entity43 , who has been sidelined since may 3 because of an ankle problem , is set to be replaced by @entity115 ’s @entity114			0
of some comfort to @entity109 is the good health of may , whose enthusiastic running in the @entity120 ensures he will continue on the left wing when @entity5 ’s schedule resumes on saturday			1
may is yet to cross the try - line in internationals but understands the reasons for that			0
‘ during the @entity120 i learnt @entity129 rugby is a big mental jump - the pressure , accuracy and intensity are higher , but i thought i came out of it a better player , ’ he said			0
‘ we were n’t great at @entity43 at the end of the season but i went away and worked on things and i feel more confident in myself			0
‘ in the @entity120 i noticed a couple of times i could have backed myself a little bit more on the outside			0
that ’s a confidence thing , being involved in that for the first time			0
i have gone back to club level and worked on that			0
‘ it was frustrating coming off the pitch thinking , “ i could have gone for it then ”			0
it was n’t quite there but i ’ve learnt from it			0
’ up in the air : all @entity4 trio @entity155 ( left ) , @entity156 and @entity157 ( right ) practice lineout drills			2

@entity5 face @entity4 in the first test on saturday
may insists @entity5 ' are not a rubbish team ' ahead of clash
@entity75 will not play after feeling the effects of a concussion suffered in *april*
