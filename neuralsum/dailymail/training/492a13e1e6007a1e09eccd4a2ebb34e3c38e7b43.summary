@entity0 may be known for his accuracy with a club , but even he will have to concede that one of his latest shots was a fluke			2
after teeing off in @entity6 , @entity7 , 25 - year - old @entity0 watched in disbelief as his ball drifted to the right , hit a tree and then bounced into the pocket of a spectator			1
the man was forced to stand still underneath the tree until @entity0 and a @entity17 official could make their way down and decide what to do next			2
from the rough the @entity46 then fired an impressive second shot on to the green and within 12 yards of the pin			0
he then went on to complete a five - under - par round of 65 to keep himself in the hunt for both the @entity23 title and the @entity53			0
fortunately for @entity0 , golf rules state that if a ball is moved , deflected or stopped by an ' outside agent ' - for example a spectator or animal - then the ball may be replaced and played without penalty the official placed a marker underneath the spectator 's right pocket , where the shot hand landed , and after @entity0 had dropped the ball back into play he took his second shot under the rules of golf , a player incurs a one shot penalty if a ball they played is moved , stopped or deflected either by themselves , their partner , their caddies or their equipment			1
a player may continue without penalty if a ball they hit is moved , deflected or stopped by an ' outside agency ' , for example a spectator or animal , then it can be replaced without penalty			1
if the ball is moved or lifted , then a player marks the spot where the ball landed , before dropping it back into play			0
not to be put off the 25 - year - old landed his second attempt within 12 yards of the pin , then went on to hit a round of five - under - par to keep himself in the running for the title			0

@entity0 , 25 , was playing tee shot at @entity99
ball drifted to right of green , hit a tree , then fell into spectator 's pocket
@entity0 allowed to drop ball back into play and continue without penalty
