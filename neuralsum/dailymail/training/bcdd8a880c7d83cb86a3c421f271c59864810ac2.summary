by @entity0 published : 09:34 est , 14 june 2012 updated : 02:40 est , 15 june 2012 a giant asteroid that astronomers have compared to the size of a city block flew past @entity5 in the early hours of this morning			1
the chunk of space rock - dubbed 2012 @entity8 - is up to 700metres wide and passed our planet at 2am gmt. it was 3.35million miles away , roughly 14 times the distance between @entity5 and the moon			1
but as it was less than 4.65million miles away and more than 150metres wide , the asteroid was still classified as potentially hazardous			1
it was spotted four days ago by astronomer @entity24 when he was looking through the @entity26 telescope at @entity27 in @entity28			2
scientists have now been able to calculate its orbit and claim it will again pass through @entity5 's orbit in 2016			0
two weeks ago , a 16ft - wide asteroid narrowly missed @entity5 by a mere 8,900 miles when it hurtled past our mortal coil at 38,000 miles per hour			1
at its closest , that fly - by was about the same distance as a flight from @entity41 to @entity42			0
scientists were n't worried , though			0
@entity46 , as astronomers dubbed it , likely would have burned up in the planet 's atmosphere before ever getting a chance to wreak havoc on the surface			2
but @entity53 's @entity52 said the asteroid was the 6th - closest miss on record			0
it was the second hunt of hurtling space rock to come near the planet in two days			1
the day before , a 64 - foot asteroid flew past @entity5 about 32,000 miles away			0
watch a time - lapse video of the fly - by as captured at the @entity62 :			0

space rock dubbed 2012 @entity8 is up to 700metres wide
