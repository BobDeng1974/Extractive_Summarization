and when a crate was removed from the kitchen three live mice jumped onto the floor , a court heard			0
inspectors were also ' overcome ' by the stench of rotting mice in the store 's warehouse when they carried out an inspection in march 2012			2
and the shop was littered with mouse droppings - with up to 70 found inside the in - store bakery alone			1
the alarm was first raised on march 21st last year by customers who complained mice were scurrying around the aisles			0
in the three months prior to that @entity51 heard pest controllers @entity53 had made 31 visits			0
however , despite this the store did not hire proper pest control			0
the store failed a first inspection on march 23rd			0
and no cleaning had taken place before a second inspection on march 26 following a further complaint by a member of the public			0
@entity66 , for @entity67 which carried out the inspection , said : ' there was extensive evidence of mouse droppings , extensive quantities of raw chicken found in a walk - in fridge which had been gnawed by mice and live mice were seen running from crate to crate of raw meat products			1
' there was also evidence of nesting in the insulation of pipe work			0
' mr @entity66 said mouse droppings were also found near pastry , on food packaging and at a pick ' n ' mix counter			1
he continued : ' upon entering a dairy walk - in fridge one of the environmental officers was overcome by a terrible smell which turned out to be a dead mouse			2
' alarmingly bags of chicken were found which were well past their sell by date with no indication that the chicken would not be used for sale			1
' @entity1 claimed that particular chicken was for waste only and never intended for human consumption			1
however , mr @entity66 said out of date chicken was stored next to in date meat which still presented a high contamination risk			1

as staff had not fixed loose tiles , pipes and doors , mice had access to food crates throughout the @entity126			0
and poor pest proofing meant the suspended ceiling was often used by mice in the building as ' runways '			0
after repeated failures to deal with the pest problem , officers forced the branch , which was used by 55,000 shoppers weekly , to close as an emergency measure			2
it remained shut for 13 days			0
@entity1 later admitted six food hygiene breaches at @entity140 where the maximum fine they could have received was £ 30,000			1
but magistrates ruled the offence was so serious it should be sent to the crown court for sentencing as it was ' clear the company had not placed its customers first			0
' sentencing the supermarket , judge @entity148 said : ' on march 21 last year a member of the public noticed a mouse in @entity1 and reported it to @entity67			1
' two days later two environmental officers visited the store and found a number of unsatisfactory features			2
' one might have expected the company to react vigorously but it did not			0
' nothing was done over the weekend when the manager was away and when officers returned on the monday following a further complaint by a member of the public the situation was the same , if not worse than it had been			0
' it is remarkable that something like this could occur within an organisation such as @entity1 which has to be so careful with its reputation			1
' but i am satisfied it is a local and specified failure of management and one that has been dealt with			0
' he also ordered the company to pay £ 11 , 822 court costs			1
as well as droppings , rodent hairs were also discovered on bags of chicken			2
as staff had not fixed loose tiles , pipes and doors , mice had access to food crates throughout the @entity126 store it is thought the mouse got so big after gorging on protein such as @entity29 and @entity29 chicken wings , ribs , sausages and chicken legs inspectors were also ' overcome ' by the stench of rotting mice in the store 's warehouse when they carried out an inspection in march 2012 the supermarket chain , which was also caught up in the horsemeat scandal , has been fined three times for breaching hygiene standards in the last five years			1
in october 2008 they were fined £ 8,000 plus £ 8,000 in costs after pleading guilty to selling a chocolate caterpillar cake that was unfit for human consumption at a @entity209 store as it had been gnawed by mice			1
@entity211 fined the supermarket £ 17,000 plus £ 57,000 in february 2010 after it was convicted of eight further food hygiene breaches relating to pest control at its @entity216 branch in @entity217 , @entity218			1

@entity226 , representing @entity1 , said the @entity11 store 's manager had since been replaced and staff retrained			1
he added : ' i make an unreserved apology on behalf of the company			0
' as can be seen from the photos the conditions in the store were unacceptable			2
' its 3,000 stores generally maintain very high standards			0
' share what you think the comments below have been moderated in advance			0
@entity243 , @entity244 , @entity245 , 2 hours ago another good reason as to why i never shop at @entity1			1
from the @entity248 , where @entity249 once stood , 2 hours ago @entity12 , employing " locals "			1
enough said @entity251 , @entity252 , @entity245 , 3 hours ago i reckon teaco will claim it 's a ' baby rat ' if their food labelling is anything to go by ! @entity258 , @entity12 , @entity245 , 3 hours ago £ 57,000 seems like loose change to such a big organisation , and for repeated failings			1
honey bunny , @entity263 , @entity245 , 3 hours ago hope the mouse has a bank account ... ... ...			2
i assume that money was his compensation for getting to fat on tesco food			0
vicious pixie , @entity272 , 3 hours ago i do not use @entity1 , however , individual managers are responsible for their own units , stores etc. it has therefore been allowed to get in such a state by someone who really does not give a hoot about their own job , or indeed for their employers , hence that person has been sacked			2
what i am more surprised with is the lack of higher management not being involved with that branch			2
i do not work in the food industry , but our showrooms are spotless , and you could eat your lunch from the floor @entity295 , @entity296 , @entity297 , 3 hours ago this situation is very serious as it is a recipe for leptospirosis , a disease which is caused by the urine of mice and rats			0
something needs to be done about it			0
where are the @entity308 inspectors ? @entity309 , @entity310 , 4 hours ago beats me why people still use this awful supermarket			2
find yourselves a good farm shop , there are so many around			0
they are cheaper than the supermarkets and most likey free range and organic			0
@entity320 , @entity12 , @entity245 , 4 hours ago disgusting ! ! ! ! @entity321 , @entity322 , @entity245 , 4 hours ago that @entity323 works well on mice			2
