by @entity0 a seaside village has been snubbed by its millionaire benefactor , after she was so upset they protested her beach cafe that she cut the village out of her will			2
millionaire @entity7 had intended to leave her shares for a massive 750 acre estate to the village of @entity11 in @entity12 when she died			1
but when the locals in the village objected to the estates decision to let a food bus use the beach car park , she became so upset she adjusted her will before she died in november last year			1
the beach is a popular tourist spot for those who enjoy surfing and sandy beaches , but the villagers took exception to commerce on the quiet beach @entity11 is a small village in @entity12 , whose land is mostly owned by @entity29 and the @entity31 family @entity31 was one of the five directors of @entity29 , which includes most of @entity11 village , as well as surrounding farmland , and a long beach			1
her husband @entity36 , 74 , said she had devoted her life to the betterment of the village , and had been keen to leave the village ' several million pounds ' as a trust fund when she died			1
but she changed her mind after @entity45 ' decision to allow a food truck to use the beach car park provoked outcry , including several angry letters of complaint , from the villagers			2
when the food truck turned up at the beach , the villagers began uproarious protest against it intended to give visitors a chance for refreshment when visiting the beach , the @entity56 soon garnered angry reaction from the villagers @entity7 , millionaire benefactor to the village , became so upset at the reaction to the food truck that she cut the village out of her will the estate had charged fees for the @entity11 beach car park , but otherwise had been completely free from commerce until four years ago , when the estate allowed a surf school and a food bus to use the beach			1
@entity31 said the aim was to help the villagers and visitors by offsetting costs with commerce , while also allowing them to buy refreshments when visiting the beach			0
mr @entity31 said : ' @entity85 's life 's work was to look after @entity11			0
but one of things people asked for is whether they could get some food or drink on the beach			0
now that the intent for the estate is to sell it , the people living as tenants in the village are worried about the state of their tenancy if the new owners decide to change the conditions of the village ' so they introduced a @entity56 to avoid putting in some great big cafe , because they thought it would be environmentally friendly			0
' the idea for the @entity106 provoked an enormous reaction from a small number of villagers who objected to commercialisation of the area			0
' she was deeply upset by the suggestion that she and her fellow directors , having looked after the estate for all these years , would do something that was against that policy of preserving the estate			0
' her idea of leaving her company shares on the estate on trust for the village disappeared overnight			0
' before , the estate had a strict no vendors policy to keep the beach and its surrounding farmland free of clutter , but they decided on instituting an official food truck for financial reasons , hoping it might better visitor trips to the beach he added that there had been no specific plans for the trust fund , just that it should be used for the benefit of the village			1
@entity144 , one of the opponents of the @entity56 , said he was ' saddened ' that the trust fund had been dropped by mrs @entity7			2
he said : ' both @entity36 and @entity147 did a huge amount of work to preserve what we have here and it is to their credit			0
' it is sad but my personal opinion is that the community people have clearly stated that they want to preserve whatever @entity159 said should be preserved			0
' @entity29 had previously decided to begin commerce on the beach to offset costs of parking to visitors , such as a surf school the @entity11 estate has been owned by mrs @entity7 's family for nearly 100 years , and is now due to be marketed in may , with no official reason given for the sale			1
the village have raised concerns about what effect a new owner will have on the area , especially on the tenants of the 21 @entity29 - owned homes , with many villagers worried about losing their tenancies			2
villagers in @entity11 are now left worrying about their future was established as port selling tin to @entity183 during @entity185 times later became centre of pilchard trading industry lt cdr @entity188 , @entity7 's grandfather , bought the estate in 1922 @entity29 ( 1956 ) @entity190 is the private , family - owned company that owns 750 acres including @entity11 beach , rented houses , an 18 - hole cliff - top golf course and the village shop now the people in the rented houses are worried about the future of their tenancy , due to the land being sold			1

@entity7 's family owned the estate around @entity11 village
had intended to leave a vast amount of money to the village as a trust fund
@entity212 reaction to a food truck on the beach caused her to get upset
she cut the village out of her will before she died in november last year
the food truck was apparently to offset costs of parking on the beach
villagers now worried the sale of estate might *affect* them *negatively*
