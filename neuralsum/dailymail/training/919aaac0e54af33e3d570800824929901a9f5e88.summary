prosecuting , @entity29 told a jury at @entity32 that @entity2 had used the ‘ prohibited weapon ’ on december 23 , 2012 , in a way that was not ‘ necessary , lawful or proportionate ’			2
‘ mr @entity13 had been taken to a police station in @entity16 , where he was placed in a cell and subjected to a strip search , ’ mr @entity29 said			1

mr @entity13 allegedly punched @entity2 during his arrest and repeatedly kneed @entity48 in the groin - claims he strenuously denies			1
the officers , of @entity51 , then took mr @entity13 to @entity16 , where he was booked into the custody suite			1
a strip search was authorised and began in a police cell , with @entity2 - who had taken the taser from his holster and placed it behind his back - and two other officers attending			1

mr @entity29 said the use of the @entity38 did not amount to ‘ reasonable force ’ , as @entity2 was accompanied by two officers , with others yards away in the custody suite			2

mr @entity13 , who was the first witness in the trial , told the jury he had been assaulted by @entity2 and @entity48 during his arrest and pushed down into a puddle on the street			1
inside : officers took mr @entity13 to the police station , where he was booked into the custody suite ( file picture ) he also insisted @entity2 had overly tightened his handcuffs , causing him pain in his wrists			1

i was annoyed at him			0
’ mr @entity13 said he received no warning that @entity2 was armed with a taser and that he was prepared to use it			1
