wrapped up against the cold and clutching one of his favourite toys , brain cancer patient @entity0 waved from his wheelchair today after his final session of proton therapy treatment			1
but the five - year - old , who has been treated in @entity8 for six weeks , will not return to @entity9 because his parents do not feel ' safe ' enough to return			1
the @entity11 sparked an international manhunt when @entity0 was taken from @entity13 because they believed @entity15 treatment would have left him deaf , blind and brain damaged			1
they were traced to @entity17 where at the request of the @entity9 authorities @entity0 's parents were put in a prison and the five - year - old held in hospital under armed guard with no family allowed to see him			1
his father @entity26 said today : ' at the moment we do n't feel 100 per cent safe contemplating being in @entity29			0
' there is so much still at stake			0
we would n't want to lose @entity0			1
it would probably never happen but just having that small risk that you do n't have to do anything wrong to have your children taken away and be thrown in prison '			0
brave : @entity0 waves as he leaves the thirtieth and last of the proton treatment sessions at the @entity42 in @entity8 , @entity43 today proud : @entity0 's mother @entity44 smiled as her son posed for pictures outside the @entity43 hospital unit care : paramedics lifted the five - year - old into an ambulance and is set to start a new life in @entity17 because @entity9 is not ' safe ' , his parents say @entity0 was eventually allowed to be treated at the @entity43 @entity53 ( @entity42 )			1
doctors today said the five - year - old has responded well to therapy but has not fully recovered as he took the last of 30 sessions of the therapy at a clinic in @entity8			1
but mr @entity0 said today they will head to @entity17 , not back to @entity61			0
fears : mr @entity0 , holding his son , said that they fear the authorities would take @entity0 from them speaking while holding his son , mr @entity0 told @entity67 : ' after some time we decided that perhaps it was best to return to @entity17			1
' we have a property there so life can be established quite easily for us			0
' at the moment we do n't feel 100 per cent safe , i suppose you would call it , contemplating being in @entity29 until perhaps they do this investigation into how everything was conducted for us			0
' once that has been established then we can think about going back to @entity29			0
but for the time being we have been in contact with a doctor in @entity17 so we are continuing with ( @entity0 's ) treatment in @entity17 instead of @entity29			2
' @entity86 from the clinic told @entity67 : ' we always thought @entity0 would benefit from the specialist treatment here at the @entity42			2
' and whilst he is still not fully recovered , he 's responded very well to the proton beam therapy and there is no reason that he will not continue to get stronger once he leaves here			2
' i do n't know if you remember the pictures when he was transported here - just lying on his bed in the ambulance			0
' now he can sit on his own , he can play with the toys and his motorics improved dramatically			0
he can also react to his surroundings			0
' the treatment is a more targeted way of destroying cancerous cells than conventional radiation using photon beams , but @entity15 guidance does not recommend it as the best form of treatment			2
last treatment : @entity26 and @entity110 with their son @entity0 , 5 , who will have his final round of proton beam therapy at a clinic in @entity8 today five - year - old brain cancer patient @entity0 was filmed on an outing to the park in a touching family video posted by his brother five - year - old cancer patient @entity0 was seen for the first time since undergoing brain tumour treatment - on a family trip to a pizza restaurant with his older brother @entity125 @entity0 was recently filmed on his first outing to the park with his family since he started his treatment in the @entity43			1
the little boy can be seen smiling as he is gently lifted out of his pushchair in the @entity8 playground by his older brother @entity125 , who then sits with him on a rocking toy while carefully supporting his head			2
the footage , uploaded by @entity125 , 20 , then shows him playing with a giggling @entity136 on a toy digger - much to the little boy 's delight			0
it is apparently the first time that the seriously ill boy has been able to go to the park with his family since he started being treated in the @entity43			2
he was also pictured at a pizza restaurant clutching a favourite toy and looking healthier than he has done for weeks in an image also shared by his older brother			0
@entity0 's parents removed him from @entity13 without the permission of doctors and took him to @entity17 where they planned to sell a holiday home to fund the alternative treatment			1
@entity26 and @entity44 claimed that they were threatened by the authorities about seeking alternative treatment			0
after his treatment in @entity8 ends today they are unlikely to return to the @entity9 and continue his treatment in @entity17			1
poignant : @entity0 clutching his favourite toy as he started another round of treatment in @entity8 @entity13 have repeatedly said they absolutely refute the suggestion that the @entity0 family was threatened			1
after being tracked down they were arrested and thrown into a @entity164 jail for three nights			0
they were released following a public outcry and reunited with @entity0 who had been removed and put into a hospital in @entity169			2
@entity0 previously had major surgery to remove a brain tumour on 24 july and a further operation on his brain on 22 august			0
mr and mrs @entity110 faced a legal battle to get their child to @entity8 after removing @entity0 from hospital on august 28 , with a high court judge approving the move after they had been released from police custody in @entity17			1
@entity0 's 30 visits to the @entity42 had 13 treatments focusing on the brain and spine , to ensure the tumour he had removed has not spread , and the remaining 17 to irradiate where the brain tumour once was .			1

@entity0 , 5 , had the last of his 30 treatments in @entity8 this *morning*
but he will not return to @entity9 because parents fear authorities will take him
this week was seen smiling on first visit to a park since treatment started
@entity200 : ' there is so much still at stake . we would n't want to lose @entity0 '
@entity43 doctors say he has benefited from treatment but not ' fully recovered '
parents removed @entity0 from @entity13 hospital and sparked manhunt
claim @entity15 treatment would have left him deaf , blind and brain damaged
