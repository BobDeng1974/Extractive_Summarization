by @entity0 published : 21:00 est , 20 december 2012 updated : 15:36 est , 21 december 2012 without wishing to sound too smug , i think we can predict the menu for the next five years at @entity6 ’s ‘ @entity11 ’ @entity5 hideaway : tinned beans , tinned beans , bottled water and more tinned beans			1
the same goes for thousands of others who had expected to be the only remnants of today ’s scheduled termination of the human race			1
like @entity6 , a well - known ‘ survivalist ’ and online prophet of doom , they have been leaving nothing to chance			1
but it ’s always the same with this blasted @entity25 business			2
you take all the right precautions , you abandon your job and go to an enormous amount of trouble to set yourself apart from the common herd in the confident expectation that you are a @entity33			2
bubble wrap : @entity36 @entity35 is selling air - purifying masks amid predictions the world will end and then , well , you end up looking a prize twit the following morning			1
those blasé neighbours who never bothered to stockpile so much as a box of matches give you a patronising wave as they set off to work as usual			2
what ’s more , you ’ve got a garage full of baked beans , bottled water , spare batteries and duct tape			2
you can usually console yourself with the thought there ’ll be another catalclysmic prophesy along soon			2
better have another flick through the works of @entity58			2
today ’s end of the world comes courtesy of the ancient @entity62 ( or ‘ @entity63 ’ as the @entity64 likes to call them )			1
for almost 2,000 years before @entity67 , they ruled much of what is now @entity69 , @entity70 and @entity71			2
and they followed a calendar which had been carefully mapped out from @entity74 to december 21 , 2012			1
now , the @entity62 did not get into hours and minutes and so did not spell out our precise closing time			2
perhaps , it may come to pass later today , in which case i will be the one feasting on humble pie ( posthumously , of course )			1
but if you ’re reading this , the chances are that we have not been vaporised or consumed by some omnivorous intergalactic black hole			2
floating @entity87 : @entity88 prepares the old @entity90 lifeboat he keeps in his back garden in @entity92 , @entity93 close encounters of the @entity96 kind : one local in @entity97 is hoping to make any invading aliens who emerge from the nearby mountain feel at home pod almighty : @entity102 with one of his steel and fibreglass balls which , he says , can enable 14 people to escape any sort of apocalypse i have yet to fathom quite why we should be so alarmed by the navel - gazing of @entity114 elders for whom human sacrifice was the height of sophistication			1
but as much as ten per cent of the world ’s population are said to have been ‘ anxious ’ that today would be their last			1
yet the mood is surprisingly upbeat in @entity69 where the tourist board of @entity124 state has been promoting ‘ @entity119 ’ tourism to its spectacular @entity126 ruins			1
a small fortune has been spent on a new museum of @entity126 culture which has yet to open — suggesting that these particular @entity126 aficionados are not expecting annihilation today			1
down in @entity136 , another part of the old @entity126 empire , crowds have been gathering near the ancient city of @entity138 where several @entity126 temples still stand			1
the last time @entity138 had this much excitement was when film director @entity141 shipped his entire @entity143 production down there and used the temples as the location for the fictional planet , @entity147 4			0
yesterday , locals reported an intriguing blend of @entity126 disciples and @entity143 enthusiasts descending on the site			1
few places have been busier than the tiny @entity96 village of @entity97 on the edge of the @entity156			1
the @entity62 had never even heard of the @entity156 and yet @entity157 is supposedly the best place to dodge extinction because of the strange mountain which looms over it			1
according to assorted @entity163 shamans and internet conspiracy theorists , the @entity97 is housing a collection of ufos and aliens who were supposed to emerge today , gather up any locals and whisk them off to a new life as @entity171 implodes			1
‘ i ’m here to welcome the great alien monarch who will rise from the mountain when the world ends , ’ explained @entity172 , 43 , from neighbouring @entity173 , ( but born , he says , on @entity174 )			0
‘ anyone who wants to be saved must come to @entity157			1
’ grab and go : @entity179 has been doing a roaring trade in buckets of freeze - dried food at his @entity183 store in @entity184 , @entity185 around the village , @entity187 prophets are outnumbered by international camera crews who have come from as far as @entity191 and @entity192 to gawp			1
@entity196 , owner of the @entity195 restaurant , is enjoying a busy trade in apocalyptic wine with the label : ‘ @entity119 — i was there ’			0
another favoured spot for riding out the global storm is the @entity204 hill town of @entity205 , singled out by @entity163 mystics for its ‘ positive energy ’			0
and the @entity62 have been great for manufacturers of survival kit			0
in @entity210 , farmer @entity102 has produced a set of steel and fibreglass balls which , he claims , can each accommodate 14 people through every sort of @entity217 eventuality			0
in @entity219 , @entity220 , @entity218 has seen a last - minute run of orders for his £ 46,000 bomb - proof survival shelters , complete with leather sofas and plasma screens ( tuned in to what , one wonders ? )			1
and in @entity96 , survivalists have been restoring old @entity230 bunkers			1
these concrete fortresses might have failed dismally when they were supposed to keep the @entity232 out in 1940			0
but there are those who believe they will keep the @entity236 at bay in 2012			1
while a lot of the @entity25 talk is tinged with comedy , it is worth remembering that apocalyptic forecasts can have tragic consequences			0
two months ago , @entity245 police foiled an end - of - the - world suicide attempt by 100 members of a doomsday cult , moments before the killer cocktail was to be handed round			1
the situation is certainly tense in some parts of the world			0
while @entity258 socialites are paying $ 1,000 - a - head for tickets to an apocalypse - themed party in an old @entity263 bunker near the @entity264 , many provincial @entity256 are terrified			2
line of defence : @entity267 historian @entity266 at the @entity230 's @entity269 bunker in @entity270 , which will need to do better than it did in 1940 there have been reports of panic - buying , especially of torches , thermos flasks and kerosene lamps			1
the city of @entity278 has seen a run on salt while the @entity282 city of @entity283 has enjoyed a roaring trade in ‘ survival kits ’ which include rope , bandages and a can of sprats			0
even president @entity290 has stepped in to calm things down			0
‘ i know when the end of the world will come , ’ he told a @entity258 press conference yesterday			2
‘ it will be in 4.5 billion years approximately			0
’ explaining that the sun will eventually run out of steam , mr @entity290 continued : ‘ everything will end and the reactor will go out — that will be the @entity119			2
’ other voices of international calm have included the @entity304 ’s official astronomer and the space agency , @entity306			0
‘ i hear from kids who say they ca n’t eat , they ca n’t sleep , they ’re considering suicide , ’ said @entity306 ’s @entity307			0
quoting a poll which suggested that 25 million @entity36 do not expect to see @entity311 , he went on : ‘ i worry about those people			0
there ’s nothing that ’s going to happen to the @entity171 , no cosmic catastrophe			0
it ’s a little scary to think of millions of people who are storing up guns and machetes			0
i just hope they stay in their hole and do n’t come out and make a mess			0
’ in @entity210 , the authorities have arrested more than 600 members of the ‘ @entity329 ’ cult for spreading rumours of an upcoming catastrophe			0
one leaflet reads : ‘ advice before catastrophe : @entity334 ’s men will be extinct			0
only the @entity329 can save man			0
anybody who resists @entity329 will go to @entity337			0
’ for many end - of - the - worlders , though , it is simply a case of ‘ always look on the bright side of life ’			1
dating websites have seen a surge in people seeking apocalyptic dates and even ‘ @entity347 ’			0
as @entity350 model @entity349 has informed the @entity351 , she plans to go out with a party and , she hopes , a romantic encounter : ‘ if i die , i do n’t want to die on a dry spell			0
everybody should go out feeling satisfied			0
if the world ’s gon na end , why hold back ? ’			2

the ancient @entity126 calendar comes to an end on today 's date - 21st december 2012
doomsday prophets have descended on @entity157 in @entity96 - said to be the best place to dodge extinction
