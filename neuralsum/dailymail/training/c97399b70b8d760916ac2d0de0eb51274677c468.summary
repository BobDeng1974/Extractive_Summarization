referee : @entity92 ( @entity93 ) @entity37 helped himself to a brace while @entity3 goalkeeper @entity67 found his own net with a comical own goal before @entity52 strolled into the box to slot in a seventh as if it was a five - a - side game			1
as if @entity67 ’s day was n’t bad enough , it came to a premature end on the hour mark when his boss , @entity104 , decided to replace him			1
he was given a standing ovation by the home support as he departed for substitute @entity107 , and it was understandable			0
these @entity2 fans know what it ’s like to see their side hammered like this			1
@entity114 came to the @entity116 capital during the previous @entity118 qualifying campaign and hit @entity119 for six			2
the bad news for @entity3 ? the world champions are in @entity122 alongside them			2
they have now conceded 14 goals in their opening two fixtures , @entity2 matching @entity128 ’s 7 - 0 victory last month , and it looks as if it will be a long year ahead			2
it took @entity6 just six minutes to break the deadlock and ease any nerves of being frustrated by the visitors			0
@entity52 had all the time in the world to turn and pick out his pass for @entity49 on the right wing			0
the @entity138 star then provided his captain with an easy finish from six yards			0
ten minutes later and @entity52 was once again the creator			0
this time his chest control and first time ball for @entity6 sent the 34 - year - old bearing down on goal			2
the @entity13 is advancing in years but he remains deadly when given the chance			0
@entity6 turns to celebrate after scoring the opening goal for @entity2 after just four minutes @entity6 celebrates with @entity37 ( left ) and several other of his team - mates @entity119 's @entity149 ( right ) harries @entity3 's @entity74 for the ball in the early stages and the captain scored the second just eight minutes later at the @entity42 in @entity13 he stands arms aloft to celebrate in front of the adoring @entity116 crowd the @entity116 record goalscorer pumps his first to celebrate his lightning - fast hat - trick and 65th goal for his country he did n’t waste this one and calmly slid the ball down the side of @entity67			1
the hat - trick was completed from the penalty spot after in the 18th minute and maybe if it was a few years earlier he would have thought about celebrating with a cartwheel			1
and @entity2 showed their ruthlessness after the interval			0
less than 30 seconds in and @entity37 tapped home from close range after @entity6 turned provider			1
the fifth had more than a hint of tragicomedy about it when @entity67 kicked into his own net after @entity69 blocked @entity52 ’s initial effort on the line			1
there was no let up from the home side and @entity37 and @entity52 both helped themselves to boost the goal difference for @entity185 ’s side			1
it means , for now , they top @entity122 @entity6 and @entity37 celebrate getting @entity2 's fourth of the afternoon @entity2 's stars celebrate while the @entity3 players stand despondent @entity2 's managerial pair @entity30 ( centre ) and @entity185 ( second from right ) watch on from the touchline @entity37 nets his brace for @entity2 to make it six after @entity3 's @entity67 netted an own goal @entity52 makes it seven in under an hour for the @entity116 and he celebrates with his team - mate and captain @entity6 as it became a rout @entity3 's keeper @entity67 was subbed for @entity107 on the hour mark after letting seven past him @entity3 manager @entity104 looks on disconsolately as his side are thrashed			1

@entity6 nets in sixth , 14th and a penalty in the 18th minute as @entity119 thrash @entity3
@entity37 adds two more either side of an own goal by @entity3 goalkeeper @entity67
