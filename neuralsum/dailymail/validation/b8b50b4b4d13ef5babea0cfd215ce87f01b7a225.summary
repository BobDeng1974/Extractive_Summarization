@entity0 , the new host of @entity1 , has spoken out in defense of himself following a social media backlash over comments he made about women and @entity6 in tweets dating back to 2009			1
the @entity9 comedian , who is little - known in the @entity10 , rocketed to national fame on monday after he was named as longtime host @entity13 's replacement on the satirical news program			1
however , the excitement surrounding the announcement was tinged by hundreds of internet users accusing the 31 - year - old - who is a quarter @entity6 - of @entity20 for his ' offensive ' posts			1
but in a tweet on tuesday , @entity0 told his two million followers : ' to reduce my views to a handful of jokes that did nâ€™t land is not a true reflection of my character , nor my evolution as a comedian			1
' it comes as @entity33 , which hired @entity0 as a correspondent on the show just three months ago , has defended its newest star as a ' provocative ' comedian who ' spares noone , himself included '			1
' it added : ' @entity0 is a talented comedian with a bright future at @entity33			1
' @entity0 , the son of a half - @entity6 @entity73 mother and a @entity75 father , was a trending topic on @entity60 on monday night as he drew fire for jokes that were described as tasteless , hateful , and unfunny			1
the controversial tweets were posted between 2009 and 2014			0
in may last year , @entity0 tweeted : ' behind every successful rap billionaire is a double as rich @entity6 man			1
' a year earlier , he posted : ' note to self - @entity83 are not @entity6 prawns			1
' meanwhile , during a soccer match in january 2012 , he joked : ' @entity86 gets the ball and the real players try foul him , but @entity86 does n't go down easy , just like jewish chicks			0
' he also slammed the @entity10 ' midsection in a 2013 tweet , writing that ' when flying over the middle of @entity10 the turbulence is so bad			0
it 's like all the ignorance is rising through the air			0
' and in 2009 , @entity0 , who can speak an impressive six languages , wrote : ' almost bumped a @entity6 kid crossing the road			1
he did n't look b4 crossing but i still would hav felt so bad in my german car ! ' on tuesday , the tweets were being posted online by enraged bloggers , who slammed @entity0 as ' racist '			1
one said : ' @entity13 , born @entity107 , wo n't be happy about these highly antisemitic tweets			1
' @entity109 was among those calling out the comic , who has a global following and two million @entity60 followers , writing : ' u should cease sexist & anti semitic ' humor ' about jewish women & @entity120			2
' meanwhile , a blogger posted @entity0 's tweets in an article , with the comment : ' @entity0 , the racist , hack taking over for @entity13 is also quite the anti-semite too			1
@entity128 and progressive liberals really will love this guy			0
among some of the skits that @entity0 came up with was the @entity132			2
' however , one @entity60 user , @entity133 , had a different opinion on the matter			0
he tweeted : ' seriously who reads through six years of tweets to try and find something to be offended about ? # @entity140 # @entity139			0
' viewers have lamented the end of @entity13 's 16 - year stint on the show regardless of users ' opinions , the tweets showed a different side to @entity0 than the picture painted by @entity33 and the comedian himself just a day earlier			1
in a phone interview on monday from @entity153 , where he was traveling on a comedy tour , @entity0 - who is no stranger to tackling controversial issues on - air - likened himself to @entity155 - born @entity13			1
he said : ' one thing we both share : we are both progressives , ' adding : ' traveling the world i 've learned that progressives , regardless of their locations , think in a global space			0
' @entity0 , who joined @entity1 just three months ago and speaks an impressive six languages , was being pitched by @entity33 as reflecting a new age of global multiculturalism			1
he is ' a citizen of the world , ' in the words of @entity169 , the network 's president			0
his dry , cutting humor was also singled out by producers as the winning formula to win over viewers			2
successor : the 31 - year - old @entity9 comedian ( pictured in 2012 ) has been named successor to @entity13 , 52 , who will step down from his role on the show this year appearance : in 2012 , @entity0 became the first @entity9 stand - up comedian to feature on @entity183 's @entity182 ( pictured )			1
in 2013 , he became the first to appear on @entity185 's @entity184 @entity0 was named as the program 's new host a little more than a month after @entity13 unexpectedly announced he was leaving @entity1 following 16 years as its principal voice			1
according to the @entity189 , a slew of better - known potential replacements chose to move on to competing networks			0
however , the reaction to his appointment was overwhelmingly positive			0

but by tuesday , some opinions were already forming			0
weighing in on @entity0 's selection , a @entity232 column compared his vetting to that of @entity236 as a running mate for presidential candidate @entity238			0
the choice of a new host for @entity1 is a critical decision not only for the satirical - news program , but for the network , whose identity has largely been forged by the @entity1 franchise , which for years was followed by the likewise signature @entity248			2
by the end of this year , @entity33 will have completely remade this programming block			0
