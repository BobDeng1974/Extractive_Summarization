by @entity1 reporter last updated at 6:05 pm on 7th july 2011 appeal : @entity3 has been granted a civil retrial over a high court ruling that said he was responsible for the @entity7 bombing the families of @entity7 bomb victims have pledged to continue their legal battle after two men successfully appealed against a high court ruling which found them responsible for the outrage			1
@entity3 and @entity14 were both granted appeals by @entity16 today , with @entity3 set for a civil retrial			1
@entity14 could also face similar proceedings			1
while @entity3 and @entity14 were successful , challenges lodged by convicted @entity21 leader @entity20 and fellow senior republican @entity22 over their liability for the attack were dismissed by a panel of three judges			1
while no one has been successfully convicted criminally for the 1998 bombing , all four men were held responsible in a landmark civil action taken by some of the families two years ago			1
outside court @entity33 , whose son @entity35 was killed , said he accepted the findings of the appeal court but insisted he would see the retrial process through			1
' we are disappointed , we have to accept the ruling of the court , which we do , but we are disappointed , ' he said			2
' it has been a long struggle for the families , almost 10 years , it looks like this work will continue for a number of years forward			2
' it is not something that we look forward to but if we feel it is the right thing to do we will continue to do that			2
' @entity50 , who lost his wife @entity51 , said : ' we will fight on to the bitter end			2
' continuing their fight : @entity33 , right , @entity50 , centre , and his son @entity56 said they were ' disappointed ' but would ' fight to the bitter end ' he said he accepted it was unlikely anyone would ever be jailed for the attack and reiterated family demands for a cross-border public inquiry into the bombing and the subsequent police investigation			2
' it has taken us a long time to get here , all we are asking for is the truth , ' he said			2
lord justice @entity71 heard the appeal in january with fellow lord justices @entity73 and @entity75			1
delivering their reserved ruling to the court , @entity76 directed a retrial of the claims against @entity3 , from @entity82 , @entity83 , and said the court would hear arguments on a potential retrial of @entity14 , from @entity87 , @entity88 , in the autumn			0
the three judges questioned evidence surrounding emails from @entity94 undercover agent @entity93 in allowing @entity3 's appeal			1
' the paucity of the email evidence , the lack of consistency in the emails or at least ambiguity , the possibility of initials referring to someone other than @entity3 and the fact that they refer on occasions to double hearsay considerably weakened the emails as evidence , ' they said			0
" the judge 's ( mr justice @entity110 's ) conclusion that it was cogent evidence is not sustainable			0
" dismissed : challenges lodged by @entity21 leader @entity20 , left , and fellow senior republican @entity22 over their liability for the attack were rejected by the panel of three judges			1
on @entity14 , they said mr justice @entity110 appeared to have taken into account evidence that should have been excluded and seemed to have given weight to inadmissible evidence of a past conviction			0
' accordingly , his appeal will be allowed , ' they said			1
twenty - nine people , including a woman pregnant with twins , died when the @entity21 car bomb ripped through the @entity130 market town in august 1998			1
more than 200 were injured in the blast			0
in @entity16 two years ago , mr justice @entity110 , now @entity134 's lord chief justice , found the four men liable and ordered them to pay Â£ 1.6 million in compensation			0
a separate bid by the families for that award to be increased was also rejected by the appeal court today			1
atrocity : 29 people , including a woman who was pregnant with twins , were killed in the attack during august 1998 not all the bereaved relatives have backed the legal challenge and @entity148 , whose wife @entity149 died , said it had been a waste of time and money			0
' at the end of the day it does not matter if the people are found guilty or not			0
they are not going to serve one minute ( in jail ) , ' he said			0
' with regards to compensation , people will not get any money , it is a waste of time			0
' only one man has so far faced a criminal trial over the outrage			0
in december 2007 @entity168 , from @entity169 , @entity170 , was cleared at @entity171 of murdering the 29 people			0
he was acquitted of 58 charges , including some not directly linked to the bombing .			0
