near a church in the small @entity2 town of @entity3 stands a bust of @entity6 ’s father - in - law , a fitting testament to his civic good deeds			1
the deputy prime minister spoke warmly of @entity10 in his conference speech last week and mentioned with some pride that he was the town ’s first democratically elected mayor			1
mr @entity6 is not the first political leader to use inspirational family members to ram home a message			2
and the point he was making to @entity19 in @entity20 was that ‘ rights and values should never be taken for granted ’			0
@entity10 , @entity23 's father , was mayor of @entity3 in @entity2 which has a statue of him but @entity26 has learned that mr @entity10 ’s triumph in local elections is only part of the story of his political career			1
what mr @entity6 neglected to mention was that mr @entity10 was already mayor at the time , having been appointed – not elected – during @entity35 ’s 36 - year dictatorship			1
@entity35 seized power during the @entity37 and ruled subsequently with an iron fist , executing thousands of opponents , banning political parties and demanding unquestioning loyalty			0
it was against this background that mr @entity10 , a headteacher , entered politics in the early 1970s			1
at the time , as with the rest of @entity2 , @entity3 ’s civic leaders were selected by @entity35 ’s regional representative , the provincial civil governor			1
@entity48 , who has written a history of @entity3 and served as a socialist councillor , explained : ‘ he became deputy mayor and later mayor some months before @entity35 died in 1975			1
‘ he would have sworn allegiance to the regime , as all local politicians did			1
there were no elections , though			0
no one could question his authority			0
there was no debate , no democracy			0
the people did what @entity63 told them to do			0
mr @entity6 is not very well informed			2
’ @entity6 ( pictured left with his wife @entity66 ) used his speech at the @entity19 conference to praise his father - in - law who may have been placed in power by fascist dictator @entity71 ( right ) during @entity2 ’s transition to democracy after @entity35 , mr @entity10 remained mayor , but was only elected in 1979 , by which time , according to mr @entity48 , his political stance had softened to match the mood of the people			1
mr @entity48 said : ‘ he did do all the things mr @entity6 said he did – improve schools , housing and get people jobs – and in many ways he was a good mayor			2
' but much of what he did only came about much later when he was elected as a national senator as well as mayor			2
’ mr @entity48 believes fervently that in the early days , mr @entity10 – a ‘ tall , well - dressed , charismatic figure ’ – was a @entity35 ‘ sympathiser ’			1
he claims it would have been ‘ practically impossible ’ for him to have been appointed mayor during the dictatorship had he been anything else			1
it must be said , however , that it is not a view shared , publicly at least , by older residents of @entity3 , where mr @entity6 ’s wife @entity66 was born in 1968			1
and neither can mr @entity48 produce hard evidence to support his claim			0
‘ he was not a sympathiser , he was a good man who did fine things for this town , ’ insisted 91 - year - old @entity99 , as he sat in the town square yesterday			2
grief : @entity6 's mother - in - law ( right ) and wife mourn the death of mr @entity10 who was killed in a car accident in 1996 aged 58 a senior political figure in the town said she too did not believe that mr @entity10 ‘ truly ’ believed in the @entity114			1
‘ the only people who would know would be his family and @entity10 himself , ’ she said			2
mr @entity10 died in a car accident in 1996 at the age of 58			1
yesterday a spokeswoman for mr @entity6 conceded that mr @entity10 had first been appointed mayor during the @entity35 era but said any suggestion he had any sympathy with the regime was ‘ utter rubbish , offensive and untrue ’			1
she added : ‘ he was part of the administration before and during the transition to democracy simply because he was head of the local secondary school			0
‘ he was then elected as the first directly elected mayor and remained the elected mayor for the rest of his life			2
’ but mr @entity48 questions why anyone who was opposed to @entity35 would wish to seek office as his representative , even at local level			0
‘ his political style was certainly very dictatorial , ’ he said			0
‘ he had me expelled from several council meetings and once had the police throw me out when i accused him of favouring another town over @entity3 in a debate about a new school			1
‘ he adapted to democracy like a lot of people who served under @entity35 and continued in public life			0
but there is no doubt he was a product of @entity35 ’s time			0
’ for mr @entity6 , his wife ’s father remains an inspiration			0
he told his party conference : ‘ he was hugely proud of being the first mayor to serve his community through the ballot box			0
‘ he sadly died some years ago , and there ’s a small statue of him today outside the church in @entity66 ’s village			2
‘ our small boys see that statue every holiday			0
and they always ask about why he was elected and no - one before him			0
we teach them that democracy and freedom are a fragile and recent thing in many parts of the world			0

@entity3 historian says that @entity176 swore allegiance to regime
claims he was appointed mayor years before he was elected
others do not agree , *remembering* a kind man who helped their town
mr @entity10 died in 1996 in a car accident aged 58
