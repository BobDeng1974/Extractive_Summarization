by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 07:44 est , 14 june 2013 updated : 11:42 est , 15 june 2013 @entity2 and @entity3 are plotting a @entity5 showdown with @entity6 over his support for @entity9 dictator @entity8			1
the move comes as the prime minister said there was ‘ credible evidence of multiple attacks using chemical weapons in @entity9 , including the use of the abhorrent agent sarin ’			1
he and mr @entity3 will warn the @entity19 president they are prepared to contemplate military action in @entity9 unless he pulls the plug on the @entity8 regime			1
in a pointed reference to @entity19 , one @entity36 source said : ‘ the pressure is building now – and not just on @entity8			2
’ mr @entity2 and president @entity3 were due to finalise their tactics in a phone call last night			2
the prime minister will then host mr @entity6 for what are expected to be tense talks in @entity45 tomorrow , ahead of next week ’s two - day summit in @entity47			1
the diplomatic push comes amid growing revulsion at the @entity8 regime , and revelations it has been using chemical weapons – a development described by president @entity3 as ‘ crossing a red line ’			1
the @entity55 says the @entity9 government used the nerve agent sarin on two occasions in @entity59 on march 19 and april 13			0
@entity55 ambassador @entity60 detailed the attacks in a letter to @entity64 secretary - general ban ki - moon			0
a ring of steel surrounds the @entity67 golf resort in @entity68 , @entity47 , where @entity5 will be held @entity70 security measures are being taken to protect the world leaders attending the @entity5 next week police water cannon head towards the @entity67 resort in preparation for the meeting which starts on monday razor wire fencing surrounds the resort where the @entity5 leaders will spend two days in discussion security guard patrol a reinforced metal fence ahead of the @entity5 conference , where @entity9 will be high on the agenda but in an ominous sign , mr @entity6 ’s senior foreign police adviser , @entity83 , hit back at the claims			1
he said : ‘ i will say frankly that what was presented to us by the @entity55 does not look convincing			0
it would be hard even to call them facts			0
’ the @entity55 said it would provide ‘ direct military aid ’ to @entity9 ’s rebels in the light of the new evidence			0
the @entity55 is also reported to be considering imposing a no - fly zone along @entity9 ’s southern border with @entity97 to protect civilians and rebel forces there from bombing raids by @entity8 ’s forces			1
mr @entity2 said yesterday that ‘ no decision ’ had been taken about whether @entity36 would send weapons to opposition forces in @entity9			2
but he added : ‘ in our world today there is a brutal dictator who is using chemical weapons under our nose in a conflict where almost 100,000 people have already died			2
we must work with our allies and friends in the region to do everything we can to bring this dreadful conflict to an end			0
policing the skies : the @entity120 is now planning a no - fly zone over @entity9			1
@entity30 jets ( pictured ) enforced a similar zone over @entity124 in 2011 @entity36 and the @entity55 will put pressure on @entity9 's president @entity8 's ally @entity6 , right , next week ‘ there are concerns about some of the opposition , but if we do n’t engage with elements of the opposition and encourage those that do have a positive , pluralistic and democratic view about the future of @entity9 , we wo n’t be able to influence the shape of that opposition			1
’ but intelligence officials have warned mr @entity2 that @entity36 could suffer ‘ unacceptably high ’ loss of aircraft during the early stages of any air strikes to enforce a no - fly zone			1
they say @entity8 has sophisticated anti-aircraft systems supplied through @entity19 and @entity147 – far superior to anything faced in @entity124			0
@entity149 , one of dozens of @entity151 mps voicing fears about arming the rebels , said sending in more weapons ‘ can only create more suffering ’			0
he said : ‘ the @entity36 does not have to follow the @entity55			0
good friends sometimes say to each other , “ look , you ’re making a mistake ”			0
injured : a video posted on @entity160 and @entity161 appears to show victims of a @entity9 regime assault on @entity59 foaming at the mouth horrific : experts believe that the injuries shown in the video are consistent with those sustained after a chemical weapon attack tension : @entity9 rebel fighters belonging to the ' martyrs of @entity173 ' battalion leave their position after a range of shootings today death toll : at least 93,000 people , including over 6,500 children , have been killed in @entity9 's civil war , the @entity64 said on june 13 , 2013 , warning that the true death toll could be far higher			2
