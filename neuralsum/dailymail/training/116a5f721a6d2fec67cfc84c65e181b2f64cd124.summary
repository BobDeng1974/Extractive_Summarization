by @entity0 published : 06:37 est , 27 february 2013 updated : 08:44 est , 27 february 2013 a hip @entity2 cafe is giving customers a chance to make sweet - sized gummy replicas of themselves to give to women they have a crush on			2
the @entity9 in @entity10 , @entity11 , is offering the unique service for the upcoming @entity13 on march 14 , when men traditionally give presents to their lovers			1
for around £ 40 ( 6,000 yen ) customers will have their bodies mapped using a 3d scanner , with the resulting file used to @entity20 print a mould for the one - of - a - kind product			0
and they call it gummy love ... a @entity2 cafe is offering male customers the chance to have themselves moulded as gummy - bear like sweets to give to their lovers on @entity13 bowled over : on @entity13 , men and boys in @entity2 and other @entity33 countries offer gifts in return to women and girls who have given them presents for @entity38 the same establishment previously held a successful @entity38 event where ladies were invited to create a chocolate replica of their face to give to their partners			1
in @entity2 , @entity38 is typically observed by girls and women presenting chocolate gifts to boys or men as an expression of love , courtesy , or social obligation			2
on @entity13 , the reverse happens			0
men who received a honmei - choco ( ' chocolate of love ' ) or giri - choco ( ' courtesy chocolate ' ) on @entity38 are expected to give gifts in return			1
the name of the @entity9 , which opened last year in @entity11 's fashionable and vibrant @entity10 district , has something of a double meaning			1
one the one hand , it is , obviously , a contraction of the word fabulous ; but it is also a less obvious contraction of the word fabrication			0
two day workshop : for around £ 40 ( 6,000 yen ) customers will have their bodies first mapped using a 3d scanner , then the resulting file will be used to @entity20 print a mould for the one - of - a - kind product high demand : spaces for the workshop are strictly limited that 's because the tiny coffee shop is equipped with a powerful laser cutter which any customer can use for a fee to cut out designs in @entity89 files			1
it also has 3d printers and other tools that designers can use to quickly prototype designs and products			2
the gummy bear workshop takes place over two sessions			0
the first , this saturday , will be for men to come in and have their bodies 3d scanned in whatever pose they choose			0
by the next session , a week later , @entity9 staff will have @entity20 printed the moulds for the gummy gifts and returning customers will be able to make their gummy counterparts to take to their @entity13 sweethearts			1
designers ' hangout : the @entity9 , which opened last year in @entity11 's fashionable and vibrant @entity10 district , has a laser cutting machine and 3d printers that customers can use for a fee a post on the cafe 's site reads ( courtesy of @entity117 ) : ' we have prepared a plan to use high - spec 3d printers , 3d scanners again , they make a gummy whole body of you who do not lose the impact of the chocolate face			1
' please try to express the feelings of loved ones with the whole body			0
' spaces are strictly limited			0
