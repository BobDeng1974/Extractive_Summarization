the @entity1 activist who sparked an uproar with a planned lecture on honour killings wo n't say if he believes they are justifiable , telling critics they will have to wait to read his writing on the topic instead			1
@entity9 , spokesman for @entity10 , was due to speak at the @entity11 in august on whether honour killings could be morally justified , but it was cancelled within hours of being announced due to public outrage			1
mr @entity9 said the backlash against his slated @entity17 talk said more about bigotry in @entity19 than it did about him			1
' people want to say “ hang on , there is freedom ( of speech ) , you can say what you want , but that was just beyond the pale ”			0
' the reality is i had n't even opened my mouth … words were shoved in my mouth , the position was assumed			0
' mr @entity9 did not choose the lecture title but said he was consulted by organisers			1
@entity10 spokesman mr @entity9 , said ' hysteria ' won out after the @entity11 back flipped on plans for a public talk on honour killings during its @entity17 on august 30 ' i , in fact , suggested a more direct topic about @entity53 and secular liberalism ... something like ' the @entity57 needs saving by @entity53 ' … but the organisers insisted on this topic , which i think is still a worthy topic of discussion , ' he wrote on @entity62			1
' the suggestion that i would advocate for honour killings , as understood in the west , is ludicrous and something i would normally not deem worth of dignifying with a response			2
' the @entity11 would not answer questions about who decided on the title of the talk , while festival co-organisers the @entity72 did not respond to a request for comment			0
' the point of the speech was to question some of the assumptions on the issue of honour killings , ' mr @entity9 said on wednesday			1
' in the end , the issue is not about violence towards women or anyone else , but it 's about cultural and political imposition , imposing liberal values in third world countries			0
' mr @entity9 would n't be drawn on the central question - whether he personally believed honour killings , a term usually used to mean the killing of women deemed to have ' shamed ' their families , could ever be justified			1
' wait for my opinion piece , ' he said			0
but he did say @entity53 opposed violence against women and has previously hit back at suggestions he would advocate honour killings as ' ludicrous '			2
mr @entity9 's decision to speak out came after federal and @entity101 politicians @entity99 , @entity102 and @entity103 , as well as high - profile radio broadcaster @entity104 , slammed the lecture plans			1
' in this current period where there is so much concern about home - grown jihadists , the last thing we need is a debate like this , ' ms @entity102 told @entity114			0
' it is a truly dangerous idea			0
' in a statement on its @entity62 on tuesday , the @entity11 said : ' @entity117 is intended to be a provocation to thought and discussion , rather than simply a provocation '			0
' it is always a matter of balance and judgement , and in this case a line has been crossed ... it is clear from the public reaction that the title has given the wrong impression of what mr @entity9 intended to discuss			1
' neither mr @entity9 , ( festival organisers ) the @entity72 , nor @entity11 in any way advocates honour killings or condones any form of violence against women			1
' mr @entity9 's defence comes as it was revealed the prime minister 's plan to stop extremists fighting in the @entity144 from returning to @entity19 was in legal limbo			2
prime minister @entity146 has been faced with a legal problem in the wake of news that most @entity19 fighting in the middle east are @entity19 - only citizens the government , who had been determined to strip the rights of jihadists on dual citizenship from entering and exiting the country , will not have the same powers to do so with those on a single citizenship			2
under constitutional law , it is illegal to withdrawal a person of their citizenship rights if it renders them stateless			0
@entity168 reported that immigration minister @entity169 told a @entity171 party - room meeting on tuesday the majority of the 150 people involved in extremist activity in the @entity144 are believed to be @entity19 citizens only			2
foreign minister @entity99 had previously said she vowed to continue canceling the passports of @entity19 suspected of being a threat to national security , including those thinking of going abroad to fight			0
