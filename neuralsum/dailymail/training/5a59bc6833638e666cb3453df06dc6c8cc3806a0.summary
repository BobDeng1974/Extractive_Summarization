a former @entity1 assistant press secretary has lashed out at the @entity1 taking specific aim on the @entity3			1
@entity4 has written an article for @entity6 criticizing the overly structured way that @entity9 's team handles her schedule and even the way the @entity12 herself deals with her staff			1
he said that in addition to the internal politics that comes with a group of eager staffers trying to curry favor with mrs @entity9 , a good deal of the drama comes as a result of ' the exacting but often ambivalent leadership style of the first lady herself '			1
' there ’s no barometer : the first lady having the wrong pencil skirt on monday is just as big of a f * * * - up as someone speaking on the record when they did n’t mean to or a policy initiative that completely failed , ' one anonymous former aide said			1
@entity4 first started his career with the @entity58 during the president 's first campaign in 2008 and then once he was elected , @entity4 went on to work as an assistant press secretary			1
he came into the spotlight with the launch of the @entity64 but told @entity65 that he felt ' pretty burnt out ' and has now left to work as a reporter			0
in his latest piece for @entity6 , the 32 - year - old zones in on the @entity69 , where @entity9 's initiatives are so intricately planned and plotted - in his view , to their own detriment			2
' unlike her husband , who derives visible satisfaction from his ability to improvise , mrs. @entity9 depends on structure to support her public warmth — the ease with which she ’ll pick up a hula - hoop , say , or do the @entity82 with school kids , ' he writes			0
' ( the ) first lady ’s office can be a confining , frustrating , even miserable place to work			0
jealousy and discontentment have festered , as courtiers squabble over the allocation of responsibility and access to mrs. @entity9 , both of which can be aggravatingly scarce			0
' as examples of the inefficiency , he cites let 's move launch campaigns that were met with less than overwhelming receptions and successful initiatives like mrs @entity9 's partnerships with celebrities like @entity105 and @entity107 star @entity106 that were almost waved off before they even started			1
close : @entity4 , seen here with the president and his former advisors @entity112 and another advisor , left the @entity1 in 2011 and has launched a career in journalism former @entity69 employees explained that the @entity12 's nationwide popularity extends into the guarded compound at @entity1 as well			0
' they do n’t want to work for her ; they want to be friends with her , ' the unidentified individual said			0
another explained how ' every meeting was like an identity crisis ' as they stressed about whether they were being invited to the daily meetings in mrs @entity9 's private office			1
@entity4 gives examples of how mrs @entity9 is seemingly aware but unmotivated by the attention from underlings , opting to place most of her trust in just a few people who have been working with she and her husband for years			2
' chief among the decision - makers are ( @entity1 chef @entity137 and ( advisor @entity138 — old family friends who enjoy rare access to the president and first lady ’s ultra-secluded living quarters , and to mrs. @entity9 ’s private thinking , ' @entity4 writes			2
that dependence on longer - term staffers to stick around because of their connection with mrs @entity9 has led to some territorial infighting issues as well			2
he cites the june departure of @entity151 , the @entity12 's former communications director who thought up the celebrity partnerships that proved so successful			0
when the @entity154 got word of the positive effect of ms @entity151 's initiative , president @entity9 's staffers began to approach her about possibly transferring to their side of the building			2
careful planning : mrs @entity9 's team has had some less - than - stellar public launches for some of her let 's move initiatives , and some criticize her for being overly cautious ( seen on tuesday during her trip to @entity167 ) when rumors about her possible ' promotion ' hit the @entity69 water coolers , people were reportedly not supportive of the step up but immediately skeptical , questioning whether or not ms @entity151 had asked the @entity12 's permission to be perusing other options			1
in the end , she left politics altogether and now works as the head of communications at @entity179			0
the article describes how parts of mrs @entity9 's personality conflict with the way that the office is run : while she is known to be very detail - oriented and demanding when it comes to having every aspect of her public appearances planned , the same level of scrutiny does not extend to the way that the @entity69 is run			1
one former aide described the mentality in the office as being one of ' how can we be the caliber that we ’re expected to be with no attention and no resources and being an afterthought ? ' for their part , the @entity69 issued a statement saying that the @entity12 has been pleased with her successes in the areas of military family support and improved nutrition , even though they used a now - discredited statistic about a drop in obesity rates to justify her work			0
' @entity212 is laser - focused on moving the needle wherever and whenever possible , ' the statement reads .			0

former assistant press secretary @entity4 has written an article about the inefficiencies and lack of leadership in mrs @entity9 's office

' @entity212 having the wrong pencil skirt is just as big a f * * * - up as a failed policy initiative , ' one former aide said
