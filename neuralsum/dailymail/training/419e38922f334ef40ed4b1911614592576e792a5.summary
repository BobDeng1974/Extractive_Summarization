@entity0 has reversed its policy on what happens to a person 's page once they die			1
from today , the page will retain the same settings as when the person was alive			0
previously , the ' memorialised ' pages were only visible to the deceased 's friends			1
the @entity0 team said they decided to make a dramatic change to their policy to reflect a user 's privacy settings in life @entity0 said it was making the changes after consulting with users			1
' some of the people who reach out to us are grieving the death of a friend or family member , and they usually ask for their loved one 's timeline to be memorialized			0
' over the past several months , we 've been thinking about and working on better ways for people to remember loved ones			0
' as we continue to think through each aspect of memorialization , we ask ourselves questions that have no easy answers : how might people feel ? are we honoring the wishes and legacy of the person who passed away ? are we serving people who are grieving the loss of a loved one as best we can ? ' the team said they decided to make a dramatic change to their policy			2
' up to now , when a person 's account was memorialized , we restricted its visibility to friends - only			2
' this meant that people could no longer see the account or any of its content unless they were @entity0 friends with the person who passed away			1
' starting today , we will maintain the visibility of a person 's content as - is			0
' this will allow people to see memorialized profiles in a manner consistent with the deceased person 's expectations of privacy			0
@entity0 said it was making the changes after consulting with users who had suffered bereavements ' we are respecting the choices a person made in life while giving their extended community of family and friends ongoing visibility to the same content they could always see			1
' the firm also said it would offer families the opportunity to see a person 's “ @entity80 ” video			1
' in recognition of our ten - year anniversary , a group of our engineers created personal movies for people using some of the posts and photos they had shared over the years			0
' for one man in @entity92 , the look back video he was most desperate to watch was one that had not yet been made			0
' @entity94 reached out to ask if it was possible for @entity0 to create a video for his son , @entity97 , who passed away in 2012			2
' we had not initially made the videos for memorialized accounts , but @entity94 's request touched the hearts of everyone who heard it , including ours			0
' since then , many others have asked us to share the look back videos of their loved ones , too , and we 're now glad to be able to fulfill those requests			1
' @entity0 said it was planning to improve the way it deals with deceased user in the future .			2
