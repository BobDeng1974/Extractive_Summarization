president @entity0 said during a thursday press conference that his administration does n't have a plan worked out yet for defeating the @entity4 in @entity5			1
' i do n't want to put the cart before the horse , ' @entity0 said at the @entity9			2
' we do n't have a strategy yet			0
' ' we need to make sure we 've got clear plans , and we 're developing them , ' he said			0
' at that point i will consult with @entity16 and make sure their voices are heard			0
' ' what i 've seen in some of the news reports suggests that folks are getting a little further ahead of where we 're at than we currently are , ' @entity0 cautioned			0
but ' there 's no point in me asking for action on the part of @entity16 , ' @entity0 told the press corps , ' before i know exactly what it is that is going to be required for us to get the job done			2
' the president , clad in a muted tan suit that drew as many comments on @entity61 as the content of his remarks , emphasized that he is mainly focused now on pushing back @entity4 in @entity31 , where @entity30 military jets and drones have executed more than 100 airstrikes this month			1
but he boasted that @entity30 could put down the @entity4 threat in @entity5 – at least in the short - term – at a time of his choosing			1
' as i 've said before – i think i said it in the previous press conference , ' he said , ' our military is the best in the world			0
' ' we can rout @entity4 on the ground and keep a lid on things temporarily , he insisted , referring to @entity4 by the @entity9 's preferred name			1
' but then as soon as we leave , the same problems come back again			0
' ' my priority at this point is to make sure that the gains that @entity4 made in @entity31 are rolled back and that @entity31 has the opportunity to govern itself effectively and secure itself , ' the president said			1
the vicious terrorist group has its most comfortable stronghold in @entity5 , leaving open the possibility that defeating them in @entity31 could leave them more entrenched one nation to the west – in a country that shares a hotly contested border with @entity99 , a key @entity30 ally			1
the administration has green - lighted surveillance flyovers across portions of eastern @entity5 in recent days to assess @entity4 's numbers and evaluate potential military targets			2
@entity9 aides have leaked to a variety of news outlets the idea that @entity0 is considering striking @entity4 in @entity5 despite objections from the country 's dictator , @entity111			1
@entity5 is in general disarray as rebels from a range of moderate and militant @entity117 groups have fought a civil war for more than three years with the aim of taking over the country			1
@entity4 is among the groups that oppose @entity111			2
crushing them could strengthen the barbaric regime in @entity124 , and vice versa			0
horror : @entity126 emerged thursday showing @entity4 militants marching 250 @entity5 soldiers , lad only in their underwear , to a mass execution near the key northern @entity133 air base gathering strength : @entity4 captured this munitions warehouse in @entity36 , @entity5 on sunday dealing with that conundrum ' is going to be a long - term project , ' @entity0 said			1
' it 's going to require us to stabilize @entity5 in some fashion ' but identifying moderate @entity140 who can govern the country			0
expanding his @entity31 campaign to a second country , though , could highlight his administration 's failure to intervene a year ago after @entity0 warned @entity111 about the consequences of crossing a ' red line ' by deploying chemical weapons against the rebels			1
he said thursday that he has directed defense secretary @entity151 and the military 's @entity152 ' to prepare a range of options ' for him			0
a @entity157 poll released thursday found that 54 per cent of @entity30 believe @entity0 is n't tough enough with foreign adversaries			2
they rank @entity4 among the top foreign threats to the @entity30 ' while overall his job rating has remained stable this year ( currently 42 % approve , 50 % disapprove ) , ' @entity157 reported , ' he gets his best rating for handling race relations and more negative ratings for handling policy toward @entity99 , the situation in @entity167 and @entity168 , and @entity31			2
' nearly half of @entity30 , 48 per cent , told pollsters that @entity30 ' is a less important and powerful world leader than it was 10 years ago , ' according to @entity157			0
just 15 per cent said its importance globally has grown during the @entity0 administration , a number that is near a 40 - year low .			0

questions loom about what the @entity9 will do to combat @entity4 terrorists in @entity5 even it the @entity30 defeats them in @entity31
@entity0 said he has asked his generals for a plan but has n't *adopted* one yet
' we can rout @entity4 on the ground and keep a lid on things temporarily , ' he said , ' but then as soon as we leave , the same problems come back again '
the president said four times that he would seek advice – not *necessarily* approval – from @entity16 before ordering airstrikes in @entity5
crushing the @entity117 militant group inside @entity5 would *end* up aiding dictator @entity111 , since @entity4 is among the rebel groups fighting him
