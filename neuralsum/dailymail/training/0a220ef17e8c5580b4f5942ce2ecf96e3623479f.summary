gymnastics coach @entity0 walked free from court after he admitted a string of sexual abuse charges , spanning 40 years , against girls he was tutoring			1
now the @entity5 is planning to appeal the sentence victims of a paedophile gymnastics coach who abused performers as young as six over a 40 year period have spoken of their disgust after he was spared jail			1
@entity0 , 66 , admitted abusing girls in his charge during practise sessions at schools and gyms across the country , but was given a suspended prison sentence earlier this month after a judge said he had shown remorse			1
now the @entity5 backed by victims and police who investigated the crimes have begun proceedings to appeal the ' lenient ' sentence , after those affected have spoken of its impact			1
one witness in the case who was not called after @entity0 admitted his campaign of abuse said she could not believe the judge had effectively ' let off ' the sex offender			1
the woman , who asked not to be named but was a member of one of @entity0 's gym clubs , said : ' for the judge to say he had shown remorse was just wrong			1
he did n't show remorse			2
he foiled the judge completely			2
' if you abuse people for 40 years , you do n't care what you are doing			2
i was disappointed that he took into account what he had been through since			0
it was like they did not take into account the victims at all			2
' internationally renowned @entity0 , 66 , has published books on gymnastics , taught at schools across the @entity59 and was a former @entity60			1
he also served on committees planning the @entity62 and was chief coach of the @entity65 gym and dance display team			2
@entity0 was also awarded the ' @entity67 ' , a @entity69 citation for adults ' distinguished in their love , care and aid of children '			2
but he admitted a string of sexual abuse charges , spanning 40 years , against girls he was tutoring			1
he was spared jail at @entity79 by a judge who said he had demonstrated ' genuine remorse '			1
a @entity5 spokesman said : ' under the @entity83 the @entity5 has referred the sentence in the case of @entity86 to the attorney general for him to consider			1
' the attorney general will now decide if this is an appropriate case for him to make an application to the @entity91 asking that the @entity91 consider whether this sentence was unduly lenient '			1
@entity0 's outraged victims slammed the justice system in a statement after he was handed the suspended sentence			1
they said : ' this sentence says you are allowed to go into a primary school and touch young girls and you will not be punished for it			2
' this shows everything that is wrong with the @entity59 justice system			0
he has had to live with this for two or three years , but the victims have had it hanging over them their whole lives			0
' @entity0 , who shook uncontrollably throughout the hearing , admitted touching three children while working at a south @entity113 primary school in the 1970s			1
he offered help to three of them with groin injuries , and after removing their clothes he groped them			0
he touched the daughter of a friend after offering her private tutoring , and another had her thigh stroked when she was invited to his home			0
judge @entity125 handed @entity0 a 15 - month sentence , suspended for two years , at @entity79 ( pictured ) he also admitted touching two teenagers in offences between 1998 and 2004 , on the pretext of helping them perform a routine			1
judge @entity125 handed @entity0 a 15 - month prison sentence , suspended for two years , and banned him from working with children			1
she said : ' these were not specimens of a course of conduct , but actually single offences which you engaged against these girls			0
' it does seem to me that this is a case where the punishment has in effect already begun , in the effect this had on you , for the loss of your standing and the strain of waiting to find out what would happen			0
mercy : judge @entity125 said @entity0 had shown remorse even though he blamed victims when questioned for a report ' accordingly , i have come to the conclusion that this is one of the cases where punishment may be tempered with mercy			1
' after denying the claims for months , @entity0 suddenly came clean , pleading guilty to eight of 17 charges just two weeks before he was due to stand trial			1
@entity0 , from @entity164 , south east @entity113 , admitted seven counts of indecent assault and one of sexual touching			1
a further nine charges were left to lie on the court file			0
in a joint statement some of @entity0 's victims who attended court said : ' you get six months in prison for taking your husband ’s speeding points , but you ’re allowed to touch a child under their clothes and you get a suspended sentence			1
' when asked if they believed his remorse was genuine they said : ' he stopped shaking soon enough when he realised he was n't going to prison			2
' another victim said this week : ' i was pleased when he admitted it but when he pleaded guilty his supporters said he only did it to get a shorter sentence and they still do n't believe that he committed these crimes			2
' what @entity0 did was a lot worse than the sentence suggests and he should go to jail for what he 's done , he should go to jail for at least two years looking at what other people have been sentenced to for similar offences			1
' when he walked into court i cried			0
he looked like he was on the verge of a nervous breakdown , he was shaking			0
as soon as they told him he was not going to jail he stopped shaking			0
it was all an act , definitely			0
' i 'm pleased that the sentence is being appealed			0
i want him to go to jail for what he 's done			0
i just want it to be over now			0
' in a probation report @entity0 backed down from his admissions , denying the touching was sexual and passing the blame onto his victims describing the impact on the victims , prosecutor @entity217 said : ' one of the victims from the 1970s had excelled in sport , and it had become for her a place of sanctuary where she felt she could express herself			1
' she said mr @entity0 destroyed that place by what he did			1
since that incident , and over the years since she has felt unable to trust people in positions of authority			0
' the impact of that breach of trust has dogged her for years , she says she does not trust easily , does not let people into her circle , and it has seriously affected her marriage and her relationship with her children			0
' she described two sets of allegations , the first in the 1970s , and the second in the 1990s and early 2000s			0
she said : ' the offences would not have occurred but for the position of trust held by the defendant as a gymnastics coach , which gave him access to the victims who were young and therefore vulnerable			2
' @entity0 was due to stand trial in september after pleading not guilty to a number of offences in april last year			1
however , the second set of allegations came to light after the victims read news reports of the pending court case and contacted police			0
@entity0 admitted eight of 17 charges against him , involving seven victims as young as six years old			1
however in a probation report he backed down from his admissions , denying the touching was sexual and passing the blame onto his victims			2
his lawyer @entity269 said : ' he has had great difficulty coming to terms with the shame of what he has done , and this is demonstrated by what he has told the probation officer , trying to deny his actions , pass them off as inappropriate not sexual , and blame the victims			2
' but he said his client 's remorse was ' genuine ' , and asked the judge to ignore the comments in the report			2
sentencing him , the judge said : ' you were one of the most highly regarded gym coaches in this country and much of your life has been spent doing good to others in particular young people			0
' at the same time , for the seven young women , who at the time were primary school children who had come to you for coaching on the basis of your reputation and the work you had done , for them you were anything but a good influence			0
' it is clear that the effect of what you did has followed at the very least three of your victims throught their adult lives			0
' detective constable @entity304 , of the @entity305 , said : ' i was shocked at the sentence and i do n't think it will bring closure to the because i saw how upset they were			0
' we must pay tribute to @entity0 ’s victims who had the courage to come forward			1
' his abuse has affected them into their adult lives			0
' @entity0 taught at schools across the capital , and it is possible that he abused other victims who have not yet come forward			1
' we would urge anyone who was assaulted by him to contact their local police station in the first instance			0
the @entity326 can be reached on 101			0
