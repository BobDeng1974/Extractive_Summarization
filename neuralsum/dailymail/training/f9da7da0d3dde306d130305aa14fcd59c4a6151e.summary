large swathes of the @entity2 population may be immune to the deadly ebola virus , ravaging the region			1
the current outbreak , the worst on record since the virus was discovered in 1976 , has claimed the lives of 4,493 people , infecting 8,997 , the @entity5 said yesterday			1
but a team of scientists in the @entity13 believe the ebola virus may be silently immunising a significant portion of the population , who never fall ill or infect others , protecting them from future infection			1
these people will never show the tell - tale signs of the disease , the high fever , headaches and flu - like symptoms			0
@entity43 members are pictured removing the body of an @entity46 victim from his home @entity48 , 35 , died in his home			0
@entity43 volunteers move his body from the house in @entity33 , @entity29 the @entity13 experts urged the world 's health authorities to focus efforts on identifying those people with natural immunity , saying it could help slow the spread of the disease they will never succumb to the extreme vomiting , diarrhoea , nor the deadly internal bleeding			1
if this immunity can be confirmed and identified , it could , a team of researchers from the @entity64 and the @entity65 say , change the strategy for fighting the disease			2
they suggest those found to be naturally immune to @entity46 could help slow the spread of the disease in two important ways			1
firstly they can be recruited to work as health workers and caregivers , helping treat the most contagious patients and high - risk communities			1
and secondly their natural immunity may make them prime candidates for donating blood for transfusions to help treat victims			1
dr @entity83 and dr @entity84 of the @entity65 , have called on public health authorities conduct studies in @entity87 , @entity29 and @entity88 - the three worst - affected nations			2
that research would aim to determine how commonplace it is for people to be infected with @entity46 without ever developing the symptoms , or spreading the disease			2
then , they say , it can be established whether those individuals will be protected from future infection			0
dr @entity99 said : ' ultimately , knowing whether a large segment of the population in the afflicted regions are immune to @entity46 could save lives			2
' if we can reliably identify who they are , they could become people who help with disease - control tasks , and that would prevent exposing others who are n't immune			0
' we might not have to wait until we have a vaccine to use immune individuals to reduce the spread of disease			1
' led by @entity116 , the team , which also included @entity118 , an assistant professor at the @entity64 , looked at studies conducted in the aftermath of past outbreaks			0
one showed 71 per cent of people who had close contact with an @entity46 patient and tested positive for the virus did not fall ill. another revealed 46 per cent of people who came into close contact with a victim and did not get sick , had evidence of infection with the virus			1
dr @entity118 added : ' we want to know whether people who are infected without getting sick become immune			0
' if these people are protected from future infections , this would open up new opportunities for controlling the disease			0
' people with natural immunity could be recruited as health workers , helping to treat victims of the disease and the scientists said those with natural immunity could pave the way for people to offer blood transfusions to those infected with the virus a healthcare worker is sprayed with disinfectants after working at a treatment centre in @entity155 , the capital of @entity87 health workers wear protective gear before entering a treatment centre in @entity155 , @entity87 she added : ' if infection without disease protects people from future @entity46 infections and illness , the epidemic should decline sooner than currently predicted and affect a smaller number of people			1
' but it is not yet known whether such infection provides immunity			0
the scientists conclude that resolving the question of whether asymptomatic infection provides immunity could be critical			0
the outcome , and subsequent identification of naturally immune individuals , could help shape public health efforts to contain the disease , as well as allowing for accurate estimates for the likely spread of the disease			1
professor @entity182 said : ' understanding the prevalence and immunological effects of these silent @entity46 infections is critical to making reliable epidemic projections and improving control efforts			0
' we believe that we can and should investigate this phenomenon as soon as possible			0
' dr @entity118 added : ' if we can take advantage of natural immunity within the affected communities , we may be able to impact the course of the epidemic even before a vaccine becomes available			2
' even if current projections overestimate how big this epidemic will become , its effects are devastating , and a global effort to control the spread of @entity46 within @entity2 remains imperative			2
' the scientists ' published their thoughts in a letter which appeared in @entity206 medical journal on tuesday .			0

experts in the @entity13 say a study into a past @entity46 outbreak found 71 **%** of people who had close contact with a victim and tested positive never fell ill
another showed 46 **%** who came into close contact and did not get sick had evidence of infection with the ebola virus
team at universities of @entity37 and @entity38 believe the virus is silently immunising a significant portion of the @entity2 population
if they can be identified it could be vital in helping stop the spread of disease
they could be recruited as health workers to care for the sick
natural immunity could mean they can offer blood transfusions as treatment
dr @entity83 said : ' we might not have to wait until we have a vaccine to use immune individuals to reduce spread of the disease '
the current outbreak has killed 4,493 people , infecting 8,997 , the @entity5 said
