compromise : @entity1 told mps the deal has protected the principle of a free press from statutory regulation @entity1 , @entity7 and @entity8 yesterday unveiled a cross-party agreement on press regulation after ‘ shambolic ’ all - night talks – only to see the deal immediately opposed by senior @entity13 and challenged by key elements of the newspaper industry			1
all three party leaders tried to claim victory after 20 months of wrangling in the wake of the phone hacking scandal ended in an agreement by the prime minister to set up a media watchdog			1
it would have the power to require front - page apologies and issue £ 1million fines , under a @entity27			1
the campaign group @entity28 , which represents celebrities and other victims of press intrusion and had four representatives at cross-party talks , warmly welcomed the deal			1
by contrast , there was no - one present at the early hours negotiations from the newspaper industry – which was not informed the talks were taking place			1
and last night there were doubts over whether major newspaper publishers would agree to recognise the new watchdog , while some @entity46 @entity2 warned it constituted a serious threat to three centuries of press freedom			1
four newspaper groups , the @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54 , publishers of the @entity56 , and the @entity57 , as well as the @entity58 and the @entity59 , said they had not been consulted over the final package and there were ‘ deeply contentious issues ’ to consider			1
the @entity58 represents 1,100 regional papers			1
@entity65 mayor @entity64 , a former journalist , telephoned mr @entity1 yesterday and expressed ‘ serious concern ’ about a proposal to hit publishers who refuse to sign up to the new watchdog with ‘ exemplary ’ damages in libel cases			1
‘ he made that clear to the prime minister			0
he has enormous concerns about it			0
he does n’t see how , if proprietors and editors do n’t sign up to it , you can start hitting them			0
that is something that concerns him greatly			0
’ former @entity46 cabinet minister @entity93 went further , telling mps the new regulator would act as an orwellian ‘ @entity96 ’ and urging media organisations to follow the example of @entity99 , which has indicated it will refuse to recognise the body			1
there was wider concern on the @entity46 benches at the chaotic nature of the discussions at which the deal was brokered			0
actor @entity107 lead the @entity28 campaign for tougher press regulation mr @entity1 pulled the plug on cross-party talks on thursday , claiming @entity112 had produced fresh demands , apparently prepared in close co-operation with @entity28			1
but over the weekend , facing a commons defeat as @entity112 and the @entity117 threatened to join forces , the prime minister reopened discussions with mr @entity8			0
his chief negotiator , cabinet office minister @entity120 , was then dispatched to talks in @entity112 leader @entity7 ’s office in the @entity123 on sunday night			1
deal done : culture secretary @entity125 claimed to have averted @entity112 's ' extreme version ' of press law , but @entity112 deputy leader @entity128 claimed it was a deal which victims of phone hacking could be ' pleased ' with four representatives of @entity28 , which has campaigned for a draconian crackdown on media excesses , were present			1
a deal was finally reached at 2.30am yesterday			0
@entity136 denied that mr @entity1 had been asleep , insisting he had been in touch with mr @entity120 regularly throughout the night , with their last contact at 3.20am			0
@entity46 mps expressed private amazement that the @entity142 had allowed talks to take place in mr @entity7 ’s office , or with hacked off present – but no - one from the media industry			1
deal : @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity1 launched a new round of late - night negotiations on the issue in the @entity123 later the prime minister said a @entity153 law had been avoided – although he conceded there were ‘ two very important but relatively small legislative changes ’ needed			1
they include a clause allowing more punitive libel damages to be awarded against publishers who refuse to recognise the watchdog			1
a separate clause was passed last night to ensure that the @entity27 for the @entity153 can not be amended unless two - thirds of mps and peers and all three main party leaders agree			1
mr @entity1 made a number of concessions to secure the deal , dropping an effective veto for the industry over the regulator ’s membership and agreeing that the regulator should have the power to ‘ direct ’ newspapers on the prominence of apologies and corrections			1
recommendation : @entity181 called for a new press regulator underpinned by statute a @entity112 mp yesterday demanded that the editor of the @entity186 be sacked after the newspaper paid damages for accessing a stolen mobile phone			1
immigration spokesman @entity190 called for @entity191 to quit after his reporters read messages from a mobile belonging to fellow @entity112 mp @entity195			0
the @entity186 accepted there had been ‘ a serious misuse of miss @entity195 ’s private information ’ after her phone was taken from her car in @entity65 in october 2010			0
@entity186 , which was not accused of stealing the phone , offered an unreserved apology and miss @entity195 said she was paid £ 50,000 damages by @entity205 after the hearing , miss @entity195 said that she felt very uneasy after being told in 2012 that the paper had appeared to have ‘ acquired her mobile phone ’			1
the regulator was also given the power to appoint the committee which writes the editor ’s code , dismantling the one part of the existing system that is agreed to work well			0
mr @entity1 told @entity2 : ‘ this system will ensure upfront apologies , million - pound fines , a self - regulatory body with independence of appointments and funding , a robust standards code , an arbitration service that is free for victims and a speedy complaint handling mechanism			1
we can put all of this in place without the need for statutory regulation			2
’ broadcaster @entity234 , chairman of the @entity235 , warned : ‘ the two - thirds block on any changes to the @entity27 could be abused in the future – not least when today ’s emerging consensus shows that the parties can come together in both houses to agree on press regulation			1
’ mr @entity93 said : ‘ we are giving a body the right to decide what is fact and what is true			2
at worse , it is going to be establishing a sort of mini self - appointed @entity96			2
‘ we note that no similar powers are taken with respect to the @entity252			0
’ mr @entity93 added : ‘ i hope personally that when this is established quite a lot of media organisations will have the courage to follow the @entity257 and stand aside from this body and remain free while hopefully adopting the highest standards in the way they publish and treat the public			2
’ conservative mp for @entity264 said : ‘ today is a milestone			0
@entity153 now answer to quangocrats			0
awful , awful , awful			0
the mps have produced a press regulatory regime of fiendish complexity , with layer upon layer of bureaucracy			2
the process begins with the political parties themselves who , by devising the terms of yesterday ’s @entity27 , have interfered in the workings of the free press for the first time in 300 years			1
as we show in the flowchart , the first step to be taken under the charter they have produced will be the establishment of a @entity287 ( shaded red , on the bottom right - hand side )			2
handpicked by @entity291 mandarin sir @entity289 , the current @entity292 , none of the four members can ever have been a newspaper editor			2
in turn , as the arrow on the diagram shows , this panel will then appoint a @entity300			0
this will contain up to eight members , none of whom , the politicians have decided , can be an editor , publisher or a member of the @entity123			0
crucially , it will have sweeping powers to oversee the new independent press regulator			2
the @entity300 will carry out regular checks on the regulator and will pass judgment on whether or not it is working			0
a negative verdict could take @entity316 back to the drawing board			0
this brings us to the regulator itself – which , as we show in the boxes coloured blue , is being established under a separate , hugely complicated process			0
the first move in setting this up will be the establishment of a six - strong @entity328 ( bottom left ) appointed by the newspaper industry and headed by ex-president of the @entity332			1
the group ’s job is solely to set up a @entity335 , which will contain five members – an independent chairman , two other independent members , an editor and one other industry member			1
this panel ’s job is two-fold			0
first , it must pick the 12 members of the @entity345 ( coloured purple ) of the new press regulator , which will be independently chaired with six other independent members			2
the five industry members on the @entity345 – a minority – can not include serving editors			2
the @entity287 will also establish the @entity352 , an off - shoot of the regulator containing the @entity345 ’s chairman , six independent members and five industry figures , none of whom can be a serving editor			1
the @entity352 will decide if the new code on journalistic conduct and ethics has been breached in individual cases – which could lead to the @entity345 ordering the publication of prominent apologies and corrections			2
drawing up this new code will require the establishment of yet another panel – the @entity370 – featuring five independent members , five journalists and five editors			0
it will be appointed by the @entity345 , raising concerns that it will be acting as judge and jury on rules it has itself written			0
to this galaxy of committees will then be added two other new bodies , which are offshoots of the new regulator ’s main board			0
the first , the standards and @entity387 , will have the power to investigate potentially systemic problems at a newspaper , such as phone hacking , and impose huge fines			1
meanwhile , the @entity393 will set up a panel to adjudicate on civil complaints against newspapers , without the need to go to court			2
if a member of the public wins a case , the newspaper involved must pick up their costs			2
but , if the person loses , newspapers will not be able to recover their own legal fees – potentially leaving regional newspapers , in particular , with crippling bills			0
there are also concerns about the system being swamped by compensation - seekers			0
to get this @entity412 system of regulation off the ground will require countless meetings involving dozens of panel members and independent experts			0
the danger is that it will collapse under its own complexity .			0

press watchdog will issue £ 1m fines and demand front page apologies
body will be created by @entity27 instead of being set up by legislation
