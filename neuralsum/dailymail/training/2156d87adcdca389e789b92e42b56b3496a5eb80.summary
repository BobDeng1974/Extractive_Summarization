there was a time when no childhood was complete without experiencing the fizzy - pop explosion of a @entity4 dropped into a bottle of @entity6			2
the liquid would erupt into a fountain of brown froth , spewing soft drink in all directions as it reacted violently with the chewy sweet			0
but what happens when you dress a grown man from head to toe in @entity17 and drop him into a giant vat of @entity6 ? they 're not @entity20 for that ! the stunt , created by makers of @entity25 channel @entity24 to promote their upcoming tv show , shows an apparently willing participant in the ' @entity29 ' smile nervously for the camera before donning a scuba mask and snorkel this group of @entity35 pranksters could n't wait to find out after spending hours painstakingly creating a ' @entity20 suit ' and stocking up on bottles of coke			1
the stunt , created by makers of @entity25 channel @entity24 to promote their upcoming tv show , begins with an apparently willing participant in the ' @entity20 suit ' smiling nervously for the camera before donning a scuba mask and snorkel			1
he is next seen perching precariously on a chair balanced above the tank of dark liquid			0
suddenly a tennis ball flies into shot and hits a switch , sending him into the drink with explosive effect			1
a powerful reaction ensues as foam shoots in all directions			0

any carbonated beverage will produce a similar effect , but @entity6 became the most popular after it was found to produce the best results			2
in 2006 , tv show mythbusters concluded that the potassium benzoate , aspartame , and co2 gas contained in the @entity6 , in combination with the gelatin and gum arabic ingredients of the @entity17 , all contribute to the formation of the foam			1
only diet will do : any carbonated beverage will produce a similar effect , but @entity6 became the most popular after it was found to produce the best results although some scientists claim it is not a chemical reaction , rather a purely physical one			1
however , the makers ' decision to use fruit mentos instead of mint ones caused some controversy online			0
@entity115 journalist @entity114 wrote : ' @entity17 are more eye - catching , but they have an outer coating that seals in the @entity118 and makes the reaction less explosive			2

shows man in ' mentos suit ' *falling* in vat of @entity6 with explosive effect
the reaction is *believed* to be a result of nucleation , whereby pores on @entity17 *catalyze* the *release* of carbon dioxide in the @entity6
