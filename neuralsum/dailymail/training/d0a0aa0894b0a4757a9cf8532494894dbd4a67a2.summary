by @entity0 for the @entity1 follow @ @ @entity2 harlequins have been in inquest mode this week after their mauling by @entity6 , but @entity8 ’s reduced role has not been among the items on the agenda			1
the @entity12 captain is back in the ranks at his club , after the decision was made by director of rugby @entity16 to relieve him of the leadership job , so he could concentrate on his own game in this @entity21 season			1
@entity22 has taken over as @entity3 skipper but it has been a turbulent start to his tenure , with a yellow card in week one of the @entity28 season — a 20 - 15 win at @entity30 — and a 39 - 0 home defeat against @entity6 last friday			1
@entity8 has been relieved of his role as captain of @entity3 @entity8 , right , during @entity3 's 39 - 0 mauling by @entity6 on 12 september 2014 @entity8 ’s removal from a post he had held for four years has met with a mixed response			1
one school of thought is that the @entity12 captain should be at the sharp end of the decision - making process week after week , in readiness to take on the responsibility at @entity44 , yet the 28 - year - old flanker is happy for @entity22 to have the arm - band , with all it entails			1
however , he does concede that no longer calling the shots has been a culture shock			0
‘ i have spoken to @entity22 and he knows i am right behind him , ’ @entity8 told @entity49 yesterday			1
‘ but of course , on the pitch , i have to remember that i ’m not captain now			2
it is a bit strange not leading the guys out , as i have done for four years at the club			1
‘ i am always ready to offer advice , whenever it is needed			0
even when i watch a game , i am always thinking about what i would do in different situations			2
‘ i will still have opinions and thoughts , and if i feel strongly about something then i might have a quiet word			0
but @entity22 is the one who is making the decisions and i ’m just there to back him up			1
’ @entity8 releases the ball before a challenge during @entity3 match against @entity6 tempers flared between both sides as @entity8 of @entity3 has a word with @entity73 of @entity6 captaincy brings with it a significant additional workload			1
the enhanced status comes with myriad ambassadorial duties attached , and @entity8 is quite glad to pass those on , in order to spend more time on personal priorities , or just unwinding			1
‘ i think it has made a difference already , ’ he said			2
‘ i ’m not having to do all those extra things that come with being captain , like i was last year , which means you are still busy when everyone else has gone home to relax			2
it helps when you just want to have a bit of down - time			2
‘ i remember after the @entity92 game last year , when we lost , that was one of the hardest defeats of my career , but i had to come straight back to the club , get the club going and help get the players ready for the next game			2
that had to happen , whatever the hangover was from the previous game			0
‘ that sort of situation was the reason for this decision			0
now it means that i am taken out of that position so i can just focus on myself			0
sometimes you just go from big game to big game to big game with your country and your club , so it ’s about having that breathing space when you really need it			0
’ @entity8 , left , of @entity3 is tackled by @entity116 of @entity6 @entity8 , right , loses the ball after being tackled by @entity118 of @entity6 with the @entity121 a year away , the fact that @entity8 is no longer acting as club captain has been identified as a potential threat to his leadership of the @entity12 team			1
but he is reassured by the fact that national coach @entity126 was consulted and endorsed the decision			0
‘ @entity128 , @entity126 and @entity16 were all involved in this decision , ’ he added			0
last friday , @entity8 was out - played by his opposite number at @entity6 , @entity118 , who is emerging as a strong challenger for his test place , along with @entity135 ’s @entity134 , if he can return to fitness			1
@entity126 has publicly invited these younger opensides to put pressure on his skipper , but the incumbent takes the situation in stride			0
‘ they always say that it ’s tough to earn the shirt , but even tougher to keep the shirt , ’ he said			0
‘ that ’s definitely true			0
there is a lot of competition for that no 7 shirt , but that ’s what you want ; you want that competition for places to raise standards in all positions			0
‘ it means you have to strive to get better and try to raise your game weekly			0
’ a dejected @entity8 ( middle ) looks on with fly - half @entity161 ( right ) during a torrid match against @entity6			1
