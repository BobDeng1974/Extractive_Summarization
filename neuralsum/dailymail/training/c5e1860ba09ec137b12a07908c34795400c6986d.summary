the high street magnate said the deal will help his group expand @entity3 and @entity4 brands further across the @entity16 and internationally			1
deal : sir @entity5 , pictured with daughter @entity22 , has agreed to sell a 25 % stake in his successful @entity3 and @entity4 business expansion : the deal will help fund sir @entity5 's planned expansion of the popular high - street brand internationally sir @entity5 is the multi-billionaire ' @entity30 of the @entity32 ' who commutes to work by private jet from the tax haven of @entity35			1
and his tax affairs were brought into the spotlight in 2010 when he was appointed by @entity38 as a government spending tsar charged with finding @entity41 savings			0
sir @entity5 , who left school at 15 to go into business , lives in @entity45 hotels during the week			1
but his business empire is mostly owned in the name of his wife @entity48 ( pictured together above ) , who lives in the tax haven , where sir @entity5 spends his weekends			1
the couple moved there in 1998			0
in the past , he has joked that the vast sums paid into his wife 's bank account are ' housekeeping money '			0
this set - up will have saved himself £ 125million in tax , experts have claimed			2
he remains a @entity62 taxpayer because he spends more than 90 days a year here running his businesses but he ensured that when he bought @entity11 in 2000 and @entity9 in 2002 , the transactions were in his wife 's name			0
mrs @entity67 has long been @entity35 based with their children @entity70 and @entity22 , meaning she escapes the tax rules for citizens living in the @entity62			0
there is nothing illegal in the set - up but he arrangement is thought to have saved the couple tens of millions of pounds in tax over the years			0
he famously paid his family a £ 1.2billion dividend in 2005			2

' i 'm a @entity62 taxpayer , i work here every week , we employ 45,000 people in the @entity62 and we have got a £ 500 million payroll			2
' @entity3 - popular with budget shoppers and fashionistas alike - has been steadily increasing its international footprint in recent years and has 615 franchised shops across 39 countries			2
sir @entity5 signalled a potential spending spree to come as he said the cash from the sale will remain in the @entity9 , leaving it debt - free and offering the ' flexibility to look at other opportunities '			1
he added : ' this is a very exciting time for the @entity9 , with a clear strategy now in place for @entity3 / @entity4 to become major global players			2
' the £ 500million cash injection from the share issue , which waters down @entity5 's controlling stake , will go straight into the company 's coffers for expansion			2
sir @entity5 's business empire is mostly owned in the name of his wife @entity48 , who lives in @entity35 - where he spends his weekends			1
so had the family shares been sold this money would have gone into her pocket with little or no tax paid			0

shops in @entity153 , @entity154 , and @entity155 in @entity156 have also recorded strong opening performances			0
but the wider @entity9 saw like - for - like retail sales fall 3.2 % in the year to august 25 as it endured " very challenging " high street trading			0
the sales disappointment was offset by moves to sell less discounted stock , which helped improve margins and grow underlying full - year profit by 25 % to £ 166.9 million from £ 133.1 million the previous year			0
trading since the summer also picked up , with comparable store sales up 0.7 % , including @entity167 , in the 10 weeks of its new financial year			0
@entity3 and @entity4 have become one of the biggest successes on the @entity62 high street , partly as a result of a lucrative collaboration with supermodel @entity175 who designed her own clothing collection for the store			1
the launch of her line in 2007 saw the biggest single day of trading @entity181 had ever seen			0
the chain has also been hailed for its skill in spotting the latest fashion trends and quickly getting them on to its shelves			0

sir @entity5 , who employs 45,000 people through @entity9 , says he always pays his tax in full			1
