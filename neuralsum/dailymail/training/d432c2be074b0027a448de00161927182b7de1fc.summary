by @entity0 published : 06:52 est , 2 august 2013 updated : 06:52 est , 2 august 2013 from mysterious disappearances to rape allegations and even murder , cruise ships are no stranger to crime			0
but until recently , operators have been reluctant to reveal details of incidents for fear that the revelations will damage their standing among travellers			1
now three of the largest @entity15 - based cruise lines have come clean on crime at sea and released data that reveal the extent and nature of onboard incidents in full			1
coming clean : @entity22 is one of the three cruise lines to have released data on incidents onboard while crime levels at sea remain low , the data released by @entity27 , @entity22 and @entity28 show that more onboard incidents have happened than previously believed			1
although the @entity33 , to whom serious crimes at sea are reported , has logged just 31 allegations since january 2011 , figures released by @entity22 and @entity28 reveal a total of 114 alleged incidents since october 2010			1
most of the complaints focused on allegations of rape and sexual assault , followed by thefts			0
" we are doing this voluntarily to remove all doubt about the relatively low level of crime on cruise ships , especially when compared with comparable land - based crimes , " @entity27 spokesman @entity45 told @entity46			1
" the majority of these are never substantiated as actual crimes after the initial investigation			0
" crimes at sea are unusual , although there have been a spate of disappearances in recent years			2
among them was @entity63 , 63 , who vanished during a @entity65 cruise in 2011 and @entity66 , 24 , who went missing during a cruise from @entity68 to @entity69 the same year			0
tragic : @entity66 was 24 when she disappeared while holidaying on a @entity71 cruise ship in march 2011 full disclosure : carnival will reveal details of incidents in the hope that it will erase doubts about crime at sea although figures offered by dr. @entity82 of @entity83 reveal that 200 people have vanished at sea since 2000 , they represent a tiny fraction of the 1.7 million cruise passengers who embark each year			1
nevertheless , bodies such as the @entity90 group have long campaigned for greater transparency from the cruise industry over incidents at sea			2
@entity95 , chairman of the @entity90 group , said : " i think it 's a step in the right direction			0
" the question is , is it accurate or is it a public relations move ? this is something they have resisted forever			0
" if they really are serious , then they will support the new law [ the @entity15 recently implemented the @entity106 and @entity107 ] so that everybody does it on a consistent basis			2

@entity22 , @entity27 and @entity28 to release data
@entity15 - based operators have been under *pressure* from *authorities*
hope revelations will erase passenger doubts about *safety* at sea
