' in the separate section for parents , staff seek to explain why children like to use the app so much , saying : ' it 's been ( rightfully ) drummed into their heads for years that photos and videos you share are on the @entity51 forever and are really hard to take back , so @entity2 's a relief in a lot of ways			1
' @entity2 is incredibly popular among 13 to 25 year olds , but the technology has been hit with bad publicity since its inception for the amount of young people who use it to exchange sexy pictures			2
in the new guide , @entity2 reveals that the majority of people using the app do n't exchange x-rated images			1
many parents are concerned that their children are using @entity2 for inappropriate reasons ( picture posed by models ) addressing concerned parents , the writer says : ' though there 's nothing inherently dangerous about @entity2 , early news coverage fairly predictably associated disappearing photos sent on phones with " sexting			1
" ' many assume @entity2 's biggest draw is the temporary nature of its messages , which encourages people to share racy images without worrying about the repercussions			2

they use it because it ’s fun			0

just as in physical settings , people generally react , interact and share things in a friendly way on @entity2 too			2
' [ @entity108 ] who to share with - @entity2 was originally designed for sharing with friends in " real life " – or at least people in your phone contacts			1
' context is key - a positive experience on @entity2 truly depends on the situation being snapped and the relationship you have with the friends you 're sharing with			2
' the new guide teaches parents about how to use @entity2 ( @entity123 posed by models ) it finishes by comparing teaching your children how to use @entity2 with helping them learn how to swim			1
the pamphlet says : ' there ’s no need to panic every time you hear a media report about something awful happening in social media			0
' the reason the news media cover awful situations is because they ’re rare			0
' how often do you see headlines about planes landing safely ? we only hear about the ones that crash			0
' of course kids can get into trouble using @entity2 or any other service , but the same can be said for swimming pools			2
that ’s why we teach them how to swim			0
