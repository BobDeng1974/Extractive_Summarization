by @entity0 published : 09:49 est , 1 november 2012 updated : 21:11 est , 1 november 2012 dame @entity1 said women were excluded because ' politics is so driven by networks that women looking after children could not break in ' an ‘ @entity11 clique ’ around @entity12 has helped exclude women from top government posts , a former mandarin has claimed			1
dame @entity1 said @entity14 politics was driven by powerful groups that women could not break into because they were too busy with children to network like men			1
in a talk with students at @entity20 she appeared to attack the prime minister ’s ‘ network of friends ’ and bemoaned the lack of women running @entity27 departments			1
the former permanent secretary at the @entity29 quit earlier this year after a 33 - year @entity27 career			1
‘ if you look at the current government , not necessarily back to the @entity33 days , but @entity12 , it is true , it is well known , has a clique , a network of friends – the friends he made at school , friends he made at university , ’ she said			1
‘ that kind of clique network was reinforced in @entity12 ’s case by the people who worked for him in opposition , the people who supported him in his leadership bid			2
’ mr @entity12 ’s inner circle includes @entity11 chief of staff @entity49 and ‘ gatekeeper ’ @entity52 , who met mr @entity12 at @entity54			1
the prime minister recently made @entity11 sir @entity56 his chief whip and @entity59 ’s chief adviser @entity58 is a former head boy at @entity60			2
dame @entity1 told members of the @entity63 politics society : ‘ the fact that politics is so driven by networks does impact on women			1
‘ women do n’t network			2
it is actually quite difficult for a woman to get in as part of an @entity11 clique			0
‘ they are far too busy doing other things , like bringing up their children , looking after their constituency			2
that kind of networking is actually a harder thing for women to do			0
’ she said that , despite a ‘ magical moment ’ in 2006 and 2007 – when half of the heads of @entity86 departments were women – top jobs at the @entity90 and the @entity91 were ‘ still going to men , which i regret ’			0
she added : ‘ female cabinet ministers do a bit of networking among themselves but the other networks in governments are often much , much more powerful – whether it ’s the @entity101 clique or the @entity102 or the @entity103			0
’ talks : @entity12 is pictured at @entity105 tonight with @entity107 president @entity106 and @entity109 president @entity108 following a @entity112 @entity111 panel meeting @entity105 reacted angrily to the comments reported by the @entity114			2
officials pointed out that mr @entity12 was surrounded by high profile and powerful women , including his press secretary @entity118 and @entity119 , who masterminds his public appearances and travels with him everywhere			2
others observed that dame @entity1 quit the @entity29 after falling out with home secretary @entity122 , only the second woman to hold that senior @entity91 post			1
after the comments were denounced by the prime minister ’s official spokesman as ‘ not true ’ , @entity1 issued a carefully - worded clarification			0
she said : ‘ it is entirely false to say that i suggested that i think @entity12 surrounds himself by @entity129 – or that he has too few women in his team			2
a cursory look at the important roles around him reveals it is simply not the case			0
’ but the @entity114 stood by the story , saying it had a tape of dame @entity1 ’s comments			1
she did not deny the quotes attributed to her			0
dame @entity139 , who retired as permanent secretary of the @entity29 , claimed @entity12 ' has a clique ' of friends from school which it is difficult for women to break into the observations are potentially damaging to mr @entity12 because they strengthen the view held by many mps that he has a ‘ woman problem ’ and he is loyal to a fault to friends from school , university and his time in the conservative research department			1
in his september reshuffle , he kept the number of female cabinet ministers at four but let the proportion of female ministers fall			0
just last week , the @entity160 ’s annual @entity159 revealed @entity161 had slipped down the global league table as a result of the shake - up			0
he has also faced criticism for dismissive comments to female mps in the @entity168			0
the @entity126 told @entity170 frontbencher @entity169 to ‘ calm down dear ’ and dismissed @entity172 backbencher @entity171 as ‘ frustrated ’			0
miss @entity171 said last night : ‘ dame @entity1 is quite right			1
girls do not get to go to @entity60 and it ’s still a boys ’ club in @entity14			0
’ @entity176 , @entity170 ’s spokesman for women , said : ‘ dame @entity1 ’s comments about the prime minister ’s @entity60 clique are one more reason why women do n’t get a look in and why the government is out of touch			1
‘ his attitude to women is of a different era			0

dame @entity1 quits as @entity29 permanent secretary with a *devastating* attack on the @entity126 **'s** top team
claims @entity105 is packed with @entity12 **'s** old friends of @entity60 and @entity54
women are excluded because they are too busy bringing up children to network , @entity1 says
