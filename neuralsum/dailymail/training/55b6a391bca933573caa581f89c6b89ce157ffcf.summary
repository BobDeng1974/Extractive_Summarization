playing video games in @entity1 can immerse players in an environment like never before			1
but a study has claimed that in so - doing , the violence in violent video games is amplified			2
this can cause anger in players more so than those who just played in @entity10 , suggesting the immersive effects of @entity1 gaming could be dangerous			1
a study by the @entity14 asked people to play violent games in @entity1 ( stock image shown )			1
they found that the effect of @entity1 could be too immersive for some the research was carried out by professor of communication and psychology @entity20 at the @entity14 and published in the journal @entity23			1
participants were 194 college students , about two - thirds of whom were women			0
all of the students played the video game @entity28 for 15 minutes			0
@entity29 were instructed to play violently - kill as many people as possible in the game - and half played non-violently - they went bowling			1
playing quick - paced action video games such as @entity35 or @entity36 can boost your ability to learn new motor skills , researchers have found			2
they say regular players seem to learn new sensorimotor skills , such as riding a bike or typing , more quickly than non-gamers do			0
and they say the skills are highly in demand , and useful for many careers - such as advanced surgery , for instance			0
the study was conducted by @entity50			0
they played on a 17 - inch @entity10 screen , a 96 - inch @entity10 screen or on a 96 - inch 3d screen while wearing appropriate 3d glasses			2
later , all participants reported their mood on a variety of dimensions , including anger			0
for example , they were asked to rate how angry , annoyed and furious they felt on a scale of one to five			0
results showed that for those who played non-violently , it did n't matter if they played in @entity10 or @entity1 - their levels of anger were relatively low and unchanged			1
those who played violently showed higher levels of anger than nonviolent players no matter how they played , 2d or @entity1			0
but those who played violently on @entity1 were significantly angrier than those who played violently on the 2d systems			0
when people were asked to act violently in the game , they felt more angry in real life as well			1
and the effect was more apparent when playing in @entity1 rather than @entity10			1
the study did not examine other forms of entertainment such as 3d movies			1
shown is an image of someone using 3d glasses with the @entity86 after playing the games , participants were asked several questions measuring how immersed they were in the game			1
for example , they were asked to rate on a scale of 1 to 7 how much they felt they ' were really ' there ' in the game environment ' and how much they felt like other characters in the game were real			2
results showed that people who played in @entity1 felt more immersed in the game than did those who played in @entity10 , and that immersion was related to the increased anger felt by those who played violently			1
' 3d gaming increases anger because the players felt more immersed in the violence when they played violent games , ' said professor @entity20			1
' as the technology in video games improves , it has the ability to have stronger effects on players			0
' he added : ' the combination of violent content and immersive technology like @entity1 can be troublesome , ' @entity20 said			2
' this is something that needs to be considered by everyone involved - electronics manufacturers , video game developers , consumers , parents and content ratings agencies			0
' participants were 194 college students , about two - thirds of whom were women			0
all of the students played the video game @entity28 for 15 minutes			0
half were instructed to play violently - kill as many people as possible in the game - and half played non-violently - they went bowling			2
