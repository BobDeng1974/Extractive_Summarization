a man was left with three of his best friend 's teeth embedded in his knee after a bizarre accident on a trampoline			1
@entity6 , 29 , from @entity7 , @entity8 , was lying on his trampoline playing with an @entity10 when @entity11 jumped up to join him			1
the pair began play - fighting , but mr @entity11 suddenly crash - landed onto mr @entity6 's leg and was knocked unconscious			1
then , when he looked down , he realised his friend 's missing teeth had been planted into his own flesh			2
but medics manage to leave the teeth lurking in mr @entity6 's knee when they sewed up the gaping wound			1
mr @entity6 said : ' he jumped on and jokingly tried to kick me			1
i pulled his leg away and his face smashed into my knee and he blacked out			0
' he was probably out for a couple of minutes			0
he was face down and i saw blood coming out of his mouth and teeth missing so i thought it was quite bad			0
' i tried to stand up and then collapsed because of my leg			0
' after mr @entity11 came around , mr @entity6 managed to call a taxi and drag the pair to the @entity45 at @entity46			1
but he said medics failed to fully remove the teeth , causing a severe infection			1
mr @entity6 , from @entity7 , @entity8 , was left with a badly gashed knee ( left ) and still struggles with swelling ( right ) worried the wound had not been properly cleaned , mr @entity6 went to the @entity53 at @entity54 , @entity55 , the next day , where doctors removed the remnants of his friend 's teeth			1
he said : ' when i got to hospital , the doctor took me into a cubicle and i said to him : " there 's still teeth in my leg "			2
' he took me off to x-ray and he said there 's only a bit of bone cartilage , nothing to worry about			0
' they gave me two stitches and sent me on my way			0
' the 29 - year - old says he is still suffering knee swelling following the incident in march			2
he is now suing @entity46 for allegedly failing to remove the teeth			2
mr @entity6 , who works in scaffolding , has employed a solicitor to file a negligence claim against the hospital for failing to spot that parts of the teeth remained in his leg			1
he added : ' it 's really bad			0
since it happened my legs stiffens up and i have to strap it up when it gets really bad			0
' i 'm very grateful for the treatment i got at @entity54 's but not to the man who treated me at @entity46			2
' a @entity46 spokesman said : ' we can not comment in detail on individual cases due to patient confidentiality			0
' patients in our care are advised to contact us again after treatment if their condition persists or worsens			0
we would encourage mr @entity6 to contact us if he has any concerns about his care			1
