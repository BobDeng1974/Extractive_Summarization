by @entity0 every year the @entity1 proudly honours the fearless servicemen who were brutally executed during @entity3			2
but modern times have now caught up with tradition and yesterday airmen were ordered to wear high - visibility vests over their fatigues due to health and safety reasons as they took part in a march to mark 70 years since the daring escape			1
the bright yellow jackets are being worn by 50 @entity1 personnel as they march from the site of the @entity17 prisoner camp to a war cemetery in western @entity19			1
a source involved with the march said : ' it is common sense			0
and there are some really bad @entity19 drivers			0
our war heros would be turning in their graves			0
' in four days , the @entity50 airmen are to walk more than 100 miles to the @entity50 war cemetery in @entity52 , where the ashes of those executed were buried after the war			1
@entity56 , director of the @entity57 near @entity58 , said the @entity50 group started in pouring rain from a monument marking the place where 76 prisoners of war emerged			2
during observances this week , they have met two @entity50 former @entity68 inmates , retired @entity1 airmen @entity69 and @entity71 , who were held at the camp after the time of the @entity3			1
one onlooker said : ' it 's bonkers - they are trying to honour daring and secrecy by ticking all the health and safety boxes			2
our war heros would be turning in their graves ' one of a group of some 50 members of the @entity1 , carrying a picture of an executed @entity50 airman the plot became the inspiration behind the classic war film @entity3 starring @entity87 legend @entity86			1
a group of about 250 prisoners , started to digging tunnels , in which they were going to escape the 59 - acre site , which had five miles of perimeter fencing			2
more than 600 prisoners were involved in the construction of three tunnels - codenamed @entity97 - at the camp in the @entity100 @entity99 , 100 miles southeast of @entity101			0
@entity97 and @entity102 had to be abandoned with @entity103 becoming the focus of their escape route			0
time for a change ? a mock - up of what the @entity109 would look like if they decided to wear a high - vis jacket over their red uniform if the concept of wearing a high - vis jacket was deployed across all units it could look like this			2
left , a patrol searching for ieds and @entity123 fighters and right , the @entity125 at @entity126 left : a mock - up of what prince @entity103 would have looked like if he had been made to wear a high - vis vest during his time in @entity130 and left , how @entity86 would have looked in @entity3 if he too had fallen victim to the health and safety zealots it was approximately 300ft long and 28ft deep			1
only 200 of the higher ranking captives , those who could speak @entity100 and had put a lot of work into digging the tunnels , would have time to escape in the plan			0
but there was a series of problems on the night of the escape			0
the main issue was that the @entity147 came up short and in close proximity to a guard tower			0
the plan : 250 officers spent 11 months building @entity103 , a 300ft tunnel out of the camp in @entity58 , @entity19 the site 100 miles south of @entity101 was built to hold 10,000 prisoners of war during @entity157 this is a shot of the entrance of the @entity160 which captured the hearts of the world when it emerged a commemorative stone has been laid over the track listing the names of the men who concocted the idea as the 77th man exited the tunnel , they were spotted by a guard who alerted the rest of the camp and 73 of the escaped prisoners were captured			1
fifty of those were shot			0
an @entity1 spokesperson said : ' there are 50 current serving @entity1 personnel currently walking towards @entity52 , which is the final resting place for @entity182 @entity181 , who was the mastermind for the @entity3 ; when these personnel are walking on busy main roads , which are not closed to traffic , they are wearing hi - vis jackets to ensure they reach their destination safely			1
