@entity8 designer @entity7 has grown the entire alphabet - on his face			1
his incredible beard has all the letters of the alphabet plus a full stop and a comma			1
the only thing missing is a mous - dash			0
after carefully sculpting each letter he would have to shave it off and wait two weeks before attempting the next typeface : after carefully sculpting each letter he would have to shave it off and wait two weeks before attempting the next mr @entity7 took on the challenge to grow an ' alphabeard ' after a dare from friends and has finally completed the letters after two years			1

mr @entity7 , who works for a @entity30 branding agency , said : ' i 've been amused by the huge beard trend in the last couple years and by interesting and irregular facial hair styles			2
' the idea for @entity35 came from a joking conversation among friends until i started thinking of it as a real design problem			0
the full a to z : here 's mr @entity7 's beardy alphabet in full ' i quickly sketched the ways i could make letterforms with the limitations of beard growth , including the bald patches , the gap around the mouth and amateur grooming skills			1
' i wanted to have a consistent photograph for each letter , so i decided that profile shots and other angles were off limits			0
' the first letter i tried was the upper - case a. i found it so amusing , i had to try another on my next shave			2
the mark of z : how mr @entity7 grew the last letter of the alphabet educational : the facial hair letters without mr @entity7 's face ' a few weeks letter , i carved in stages the @entity67 , @entity68 , and l from a single beard			1
each time i shaved , i 'd have to wait a few weeks before i could shave the next one			0
' some people have given me way too much credit for the time and dedication it took to complete it , but really it just added a few minutes to my regular shaving routine			0
' i would occasionally ask my six - year old son if he could recognise the letter i had created , or ask my wife if she 'd like me to wear that letter for the day			0
' i continued until the end of 2013 when i finally crafted the last letter , the elusive @entity85 with some regret i must say i did not walk around in public wearing the @entity35 letters			0
' this project began back in 2011 and i finally completed the 26 character alphabet at the end of 2013			0
