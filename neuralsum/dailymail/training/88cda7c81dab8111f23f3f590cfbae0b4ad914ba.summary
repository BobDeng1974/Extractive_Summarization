@entity0 have broken their transfer record to sign striker @entity2 in the hope that the @entity4 will score the goals to help keep them in the @entity7			1
it 's a calculated gamble from the foxes , who have weighed up the £ 9million fee paid to @entity12 against the cost of relegation back to the @entity15			1
it 's not the first time that a team in trouble has spent big in january			2
here , @entity20 looks at five other attempts by @entity7 clubs to spend their way to safety			1
@entity2 arrives at @entity0 , where he 's signed in a deal worth £ 9m pending a work permit @entity2 scored 28 goals in 31 games for @entity12 this season ahead of his @entity0 move @entity30 to @entity31 ( £ 12million ) the @entity33 international came to @entity31 on deadline day in january 2014 from @entity35 , and the west @entity37 club had high expectations after paying a reported club record £ 12m			1
prior to joining , @entity30 had scored 17 goals in just 19 matches for the @entity33 champions , including a hat - trick in the @entity44			1
@entity31 pinned their hopes of survival on the 6ft 2in striker , and he made his debut as @entity31 drew 1 - 1 against @entity49 , coming on as a substitute for @entity51			1
however , due to various fitness issues , @entity30 only made two further appearances for the club , and one was off the bench			2
after his dismal first term at @entity58 , @entity30 was loaned back to @entity35 for the whole season , where the 26 - year - old has once more , shown he is a top marksman , hitting 10 goals in his 18 appearances so far , including scoring the winner against @entity65 champions @entity64 in the @entity44			1
@entity31 paid £ 12million to @entity33 champions @entity35 for @entity30 in january 2014 the @entity67 international made just three appearances for the west @entity37 club before going on loan @entity72 to @entity73 ( £ 5million ) with @entity73 desperately in need of a striker to help prevent relegation , manager @entity74 turned to @entity78 's @entity72			1
the former @entity80 man had a decent record in his first season in the top flight , scoring 12 goals			0
however , in his second season with the @entity87 club , he scored just three times in 18 appearances			0
with @entity78 ready to offload the forward , @entity73 spent £ 5m on the 29 - year - old but things did not go @entity72 's way			1
the known - @entity95 supporter was booed by @entity73 fans on his debut after coming on as a substitute against @entity99			2
and @entity72 never found his feet at the @entity101 , failing to score a single goal in 12 league appearances			0
the following season , he was loaned out to @entity7 rivals @entity104 , where he only managed one goal in 18 appearances			1
loans to @entity15 sides @entity107 and @entity108 followed , but @entity72 is yet to rediscover the form that earned him his @entity7 status			1
@entity72 was booed on his debut for @entity73 because of his known support of @entity95 and @entity72 endured a torrid time with the @entity73 , failing to score in his 13 appearances for the club @entity116 to @entity117 ( £ 12.5million ) after previous success in @entity119 with @entity120 , and after a difficult period in @entity122 with big - spending club @entity123 , @entity116 earned a move back to @entity119 with @entity117			1
however , the fee of £ 12.5m and his reported wages of £ 100,000 per week meant great pressure on his shoulders to keep the struggling hoops up			2
unfortunately for him , some of performances , especially in the 3 - 2 defeat to @entity31 , came under considerable criticism and scrutiny			2
he was unable to shore up the west @entity37 's defence or save them from relegation to the championship			0
he was sold back to @entity123 for £ 12m			2
@entity117 boss @entity139 said upon signing him : ' @entity140 is just what we need			0
great in the air , quick , a leader , strong , fantastic in both boxes , hard as nails			0
he 's a proper centre - half			2
' unfortunately for @entity116 , that 's not quite how he 'll be remembered by the @entity150 faithful			0
@entity116 enjoyed success with @entity120 but was less impressive for @entity117 @entity116 fails to prevent then - @entity154 striker @entity153 from scoring at @entity150 @entity155 to @entity117 ( £ 4million ) with @entity117 languishing just above the relegation zone when @entity158 took over in january , goals were a necessity			1
so he looked to @entity162 striker , @entity155			0
the former @entity164 striker went on a great scoring run in west @entity37 , finding the net six times in eight appearances			0
however , his time was blighted by two red cards in his first five matches , with @entity117 going on to lose those fixtures			0
the @entity117 secured safety on the final day of the season , with a goal from @entity155 , but despite his prolific start to his @entity117 career , the following season , he only managed three goals in 18 appearances , and was loaned out for the remainder of the campaign to @entity182 club @entity181			2
@entity155 celebrates scoring against @entity183 on the day they won the @entity7 @entity155 was prolific when he first arrived at the club but the goals dried up in his second season @entity187 to @entity31 ( £ 2.5million ) @entity31 were struggling in the league , especially defensively , so a defender was a must for @entity191 , whose side were in 18th place when he took over			1
the answer was to be the @entity196 man mountain , @entity187 , signed for an undisclosed fee on 18th january			0
he formed a good partnership with fellow centre back @entity199 , as they fought to keep the west @entity37 club up			0
he would stay with the @entity202 for another six years , resisting temptations to move elsewhere when ' bigger ' clubs were rumoured to come calling			0
on his debut at @entity206 , he was voted man of the match and until the beginning of this season , he was at the heart of the @entity31 defence			0
@entity187 challenges @entity214 's @entity213 in the season @entity31 were relegated hangeland , signed for the club by @entity191 , spent six years with the @entity202			0

@entity0 paid @entity12 £ 9m for @entity4 forward @entity2
the foxes will be hoping the 23 - year - old can fire them to safety
