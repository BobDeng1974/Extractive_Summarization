this two - year - old boy was meant to be in a wheelchair for the rest of his life			2
doctors claimed little @entity5 would never walk , roll , crawl or even swallow food and he would see life out as a vegetable			1
but now he is remarkably defying the experts and slowly overcoming the debilitating symptoms of his cerebral palsy with the help of alternative therapies			1
he spent two weeks in the @entity23 at @entity24 with his parents , @entity26 and @entity27 , before he contracted both a blood and chest infection that caused him to lose about 40 percent of his brain cells			1
' he lost brain cells mostly on the left hand side , which is responsible for motor skills ... they said he will be a vegetable in a wheelchair , ' ms rooms told @entity37			1
' they said he would n't even be able to hold his head up , swallow food or drink water			1
' he started the alternative therapies on the @entity42 when he was eight months old and his parents say he has improved immensely prior to the @entity45 therapy , @entity5 could n't sit up , roll over or even extend his limbs			1
but the two - year - old was able to reach out for a toy after just one week of treatment but it took just one successful breast feeding attempt after a three month stint in hospital to convince @entity5 's parents he could defy the doctors			1
his parents started to counteract the effects of his cerebral palsy with early intervention using alternative therapies			1
' in the first year he did n't develop at all			0
he could n't roll over and i could n't put him on his tummy because he went blue , ' ms rooms said			2
his parents , @entity26 and @entity27 , then flew the two - year - old to the @entity64 for two months to undergo extensive therapy ' he could n't straighten his arms or unclench his fists			1
he could n't move or do anything - his limbs started to slowly deform			2
' ms @entity70 found a therapy called @entity72 , which is popular in her native @entity73			1
' we started when he was eight months old			2
we came to the @entity42 from @entity24 for one week to see the only @entity72 therapist in @entity77 , ' she said			0
' after one week , @entity5 opened his hand for the first time and reached out for a toy			2
he rolled over three times and we thought that was a miracle			0
' he spent two weeks in the @entity23 at @entity24 before he contracted both a blood and chest infection that caused him to lose about 40 percent of his brain cells he spent three months battling in hospital after doctors told his parents he was unlikely to survive the family moved to the @entity42 soon after so @entity5 could undergo the therapy everyday			1
after hearing about another therapy available in @entity64 known as the ' therasuit ' , @entity5 and his parents spent two months overseas for treatment			1
' when we brought him back from @entity64 … he could hold his head upright and the rolling became consistent			2
he also started commando crawling			0
it was just another miracle , ' ms @entity70 said			0
' for us he is becoming more and more mobile , so that means when you look at @entity5 you ca n't immediately see he has cerebral palsy any more			1
' even the eating has changed			0
before he could only eat liquid and he struggled putting weight on			2
now , today he ate half my toast with avocado			0
' ' he can now see the world while sitting instead of laying flat on his back			0
' @entity5 has now started eating solid foods after surviving on a liquid diet because he could n't swallow properly it took just one successful breast feeding attempt after a three month stint in hospital to convince @entity5 's parents he could defy the doctors due to the therapy 's success , the @entity117 and five other families pitched in to hire a therapist from the @entity64 program to come to @entity77 for 10 weeks			1
' the next step for @entity5 is crawling on his arms and legs			2
he just wants to stand up and walk , but we need to teach him to use the right muscles first , ' ms rooms said			0
' i think he will walk eventually , although i 'm not sure if it will be with an aide			0
we know it will still take a long time , but he surprises us every single day			0
' he does the therapy every day for three hours			0
if i went to the gym for that long , i would be narky and sore			0
but he does it with a smile , so it 's just amazing			0
' his mum @entity26 says she 's hopeful @entity5 will walk in the near future , but they are trying to teach him to use the right muscles first @entity5 undergoes three hours of therapy every day and his parents say the results have been remarkable the two - year - old 's family moved to the @entity42 so @entity5 could undergo the therapy everyday as for the doctors who said @entity5 would not be able to move , ms rooms said they 're gobsmacked			1
' the doctors were very amazed			0
when we used to go to the doctors , they would just prescribe medication or equipment			0
but we were always against , ' she said			0
' now they keep saying , " whatever you ’re doing keep doing it "			0
' fellow @entity161 @entity160 , 3 , has undergone the same therasuit treatment in the @entity64			2
diagnosed with cerebral palsy in 2010 , @entity160 has had similar success to @entity5 - he can now roll over and sit up on his own			1
