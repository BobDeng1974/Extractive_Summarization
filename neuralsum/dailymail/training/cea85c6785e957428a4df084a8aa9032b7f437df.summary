engineers at @entity1 have designed a breakthrough gadget that ' harvests ' background microwave radiation and converts it into electricity , with the same efficiency as solar panels			1
the development , unveiled on thursday , raises exciting possibilities such as recharging a phone wirelessly and providing power to remote locations that ca n't access conventional electricity			2
and the researchers say that their inexpensive invention is remarkably versatile			2
it could be used to capture ' lost ' energy from a range of sources such as satellite transmissions , sound signals or @entity22			1
the future : the device that is capable of harvesting microwave signals from the air consists of five fiberglass and copper conductors wired together on a circuit board the @entity1 engineers used metamaterials , which their press release describes as ' engineered structures that can capture various forms of wave energy and tune them for useful applications			1
' they say the device harvested microwaves with an efficiency of 36.8 percent , similar to modern solar cells that capture light energy			1
a report that will appear in the journal @entity47 in december states that this invention is capable of converting microwave signals to enough direct current voltage to recharge a cell phone battery			1
the gadget , created by undergraduate engineering student @entity53 , graduate student @entity54 and lead investigator @entity55 , consists of five fiberglass and copper conductors wired together on a circuit board			0
it is capable of providing @entity60 of electricity			2
as the press release points out , current usb chargers provide around @entity64			0
@entity53 said : ' we were aiming for the highest energy efficiency we could achieve			0
we had been getting energy efficiency around 6 to 10 percent , but with this design we were able to dramatically improve energy conversion to 37 percent , which is comparable to what is achieved in solar cells			0
' proud : @entity54 ( left ) and @entity53 ( right ) pioneered the breakthrough			0
' it 's possible to use this design for a lot of different frequencies and types of energy , including vibration and sound energy harvesting , ' said @entity54 his colleague , @entity54 , added : ' it 's possible to use this design for a lot of different frequencies and types of energy , including vibration and sound energy harvesting			2
' until now , a lot of work with metamaterials has been theoretical			0
we are showing that with a little work , these materials can be useful for consumer applications			0
' possible uses for the new technology include building metamaterial into homes to ensure @entity22 signals are not just lost			1
electrical products could also have a device attached to increase efficiency by ensuring that excess power is not wasted			2
in theory , the invention could also be used to beam signals from phone towers that could then be converted into electricity			1
electronic devices could be recharged wirelessly or electricity sent to remote areas without power cables			1
power : the device harvested microwaves with an efficiency of 36.8 percent , similar to the solar cells installed on this @entity118 home in a file photo the researchers explained that a series of the power - harvesters could even capture signals from satellites passing overhead			1
this could allow for electricity in hostile environments such as mountaintops or deserts			1
@entity55 said : ' our work demonstrates a simple and inexpensive approach to electromagnetic power harvesting			0
' the beauty of the design is that the basic building blocks are self - contained and additive			0
one can simply assemble more blocks to increase the scavenged power			0

device captures microwaves and converts them into electricity
future versions could harvest satellite , sound or @entity22 signals
technology could be used to recharge phones without cables or beam electricity to mountaintops
