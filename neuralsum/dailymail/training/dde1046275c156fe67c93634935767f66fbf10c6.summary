it 's a huge weight off @entity2 's shoulders - or , to be more accurate , off his formerly swollen midsection , which until not long ago helped him tip the scales at 26 - stone			1
that 's nine - stone more than during @entity2 's dozen seasons in the @entity8 , where he played for the @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12			1
on thursday 's edition of ' @entity14 ' , @entity2 reveals his current physique - just 17 - stone on his 6ft 6in frame			1

' i get a new wardrobe , and they even cut my hair , ' @entity2 said wednesday in a phone interview			1
' i look pretty darn good			2
' that 's a self - appraisal the 47 - year - old @entity2 would n't have voiced a few months ago			1
' i really struggled with my weight during my playing career , ' he recalled , having routinely gained 15 to 20 pounds each off - season that he had to lose before each season began			2
' when i retired in 2001 , there were no more football seasons to get ready for			0
i had worked out because of my job , and after retiring i kind of resented exercise because of that			0
so i just slowly put on weight			0
' by the time ' @entity14 ' came calling , @entity2 had reconciled himself to being fat the rest of his life			1
@entity2 weighed 366 pounds ( 26 - stone ) before joining the @entity19 television programme to lose weight @entity2 pictured on the programme with bowls of fatty foods in front of him but how long would that life be ? by then he was in precarious health , he said - a borderline diabetic suffering from sleep apnoea and high blood pressure even so , he agreed to take the ' @entity14 ' challenge filled with dread			1
besides the physical demands he knew lay ahead , he was living with shame he neither wanted to confront nor share with an audience of millions			0
' you have no idea how terrified i was , ' he said			0
' pro athletes do n't have emotional issues - or are n't supposed to			2
you ca n't show any kind of weakness			2
there 's no crying in football			0
' along with the exercise and nutritional regimen , he tangled with emotional issues he had long held at bay			0
' once i got there , they said , ` you 're gon na lose weight , but you 'll gain it all back unless you figure out why you gained it in the first place			0
' @entity2 ( second from the right ) with the other contestants on the television show quarterback @entity2 while playing for the @entity10 in 1997 ( left ) and 1998 ( right ) and , yes , he cried			1
in particular , he recalled a morning hike when ' i just lost it - i sat down on the trail and sobbed uncontrollably , about how in my life i was focusing on the things that brought me pain and sorrow , and how that was a big part of why i gained weight			1
i did n't want to deal with it			0
' i realised i had shut myself off emotionally , and when i opened myself up , there was a lot more to me than i was giving myself credit for			0
i told myself , " you 're a great guy , @entity105 , and you have a great life "			0
' @entity2 calls the experience ' beautiful , wonderful , lifesaving			2
and the hardest damn thing i 've done in my life			0
' harder than his rough - and - tumble football days ? he laughed			2
