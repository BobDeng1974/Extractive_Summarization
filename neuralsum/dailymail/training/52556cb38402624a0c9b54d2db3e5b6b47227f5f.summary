by @entity0 published : 06:32 est , 6 september 2013 updated : 07:55 est , 6 september 2013 gardeners have been rubbing their hands for weeks at the prospect of bumper harvests of everything from carrots to courgettes after the long , hot summer			1
but a hotel in @entity10 is about to clean - up with what it is expected to be its biggest ever crop - of loofahs			1
contrary to popular belief , the back scrubbers , which are popular in bathrooms up and down the country , are not related to sea sponges at all			1
@entity51 has been growing @entity53 's only crop for the past five years at its 32 - acre home , which is located - naturally - just outside @entity55			2
plant your loofah seeds in pots in a warm environment in early spring and wait for them to germinate			1
once the seeds have sprouted , transfer the plants to the greenhouse			0
@entity64 , which grow on vines , will largely take care of themselves			0
as they mature their skins will become tough and rubbery			0
they will be less tasty to eat , but will make a better bathroom implement			1
once they have matured , pick the loofahs , peel off their skins and remove the seeds			1
try to squeeze out as much of the flesh as possible			0
leave the fibrous husk in the sun to dry			0
after about a week your loofah will be ready to be moved to the bathroom			1
such has been this year 's success with weather that has brought the wasps out in their droves , the hotel will be holding a @entity84 next month			1
head gardener @entity85 added : ' this year they 're bigger than ever			1
we 've had a few whopping big loofah well over 15 inches long			1
' they are from the same family as cucumbers , but they 're different			0
you can eat them when they are young , but i have n't dared to give it a go yet			0
' vegetable gardener @entity98 added : ' they 're actually not that tough to grow , but they are tough to eat			2
' we start them in pots in february before planting them in the greenhouse in may			0
' they 're kind of like growing tomatoes			0
once you 've got them out of the pots and planted up they pretty much look after themselves			2
' loofahs are fibrous vegetables with dark green skin that get increasingly tough and rubbery with age			0
the mature fruits are harvested and left to dry until all the soft flesh has gone , leaving only a network of fibres which become the familiar bathroom sight			2
they are eaten in their native @entity46 and also commonly used in bathing			0
drying process : vegetable gardener @entity98 inspects the loofah harvest at @entity51 unique : @entity51 has been growing @entity53 's only loofah crop for the past five years on its estate harvest : this year 's heat wave has provided the perfect growing conditions for @entity22 's loofahs guests of the hotel are spoiled with their very own loofahs , which are grown on the estate			1
mr @entity85 said : ' once we 've peeled off the skins and emptied out the seeds we wash them and squeeze out as much flesh as possible			2
' they 're quite slimy			0
they feel like they 're full of soap			0
' once they have been thoroughly cleaned , we hang them up for a week or two , and then bang - you have yourself a loofah			2
' tough : fibrous dried loofahs ( left ) make useful bathroom implements , but can be tough to eat ( right ) ripe : @entity64 will be harvested in time for a festival due to take place at the hotel next month			1

' we 've had a few whopping loofah , well over 15 inches long , ' says gardener
@entity10 hotel is expecting to pick its biggest harvest yet next month
the bathroom scrubber is actually a type of gourd , not a sea sponge
