prince @entity14 , an international relations consultant to the president of the @entity0 committee , told @entity19 sports website @entity17 that he could see the country bidding for the @entity4 with another @entity22 state			1
' it has a hard time accepting that women can compete in sports , especially in swimming			2
' wearing sports clothing in public is not really allowed			0
for these cultural reasons , it is difficult to bid for certain big international events			0
' but @entity14 maintained a compromise was possible , proposing an arrangement with another @entity51 country such as @entity13			2
he said : ' we could envisage it with @entity13			2
' we have always had a form of cooperation with that country			0
' @entity13 would hold the women 's events , we would hold the men 's competitions			1
' @entity61 was meant to compete for @entity0 at @entity26 before her horse got injured @entity0 sent female athletes to the @entity4 for the first time at @entity26 , caving in to pressure from the @entity30 after the only other countries never to field women competitors , @entity68 and @entity69 , agreed to do so			1
@entity0 conservatives denounced the country 's two female competitors in @entity73 , 800 - metre runner @entity24 and judoka @entity74 , as ' prostitutes ' on social media			1
@entity24 finished last in her heat , some 45 seconds behind the winner , while running in a hijab and @entity81 - compliant sportswear			0

the opening ceremony at the @entity89 in east @entity73			0
@entity0 sent female athletes to compete at the games for the first time hard - line religious clerics in @entity0 are often uncomfortable with women exercising , warning that it may expose them to licentiousness and blur gender boundaries			1
judoka @entity74 was just 16 when she competed for @entity0 at @entity26 female athletes have a hard time finding facilities to train and are not allowed to attend matches in stadiums			1
the @entity30 swiftly dismissed @entity14 's suggestion for a segregated games			0
committee president @entity105 told the @entity106 : ' a commitment to " non-discrimination " will be mandatory for all countries hoping to bid for the @entity4 in the future			0
' this was made very clear in the @entity113 2020 reforms and will even be in the host city contract			0
' if this is not applied , the bid would not be admissible			0
countries like @entity0 must really work to allow female athletes to freely participate			1
' @entity14 said in his interview that a @entity0 - @entity13 joint candidacy would be allowed under the @entity113 2020 reform package approved by the @entity30 in @entity122			1
the changes opened the door to holding events outside a host city or country , as well as possible joint bids by cities , neighboring countries or regions , but only in ' exceptional cases '			0
but @entity30 spokesman @entity133 added : ' you can not simply " outsource " certain issues to another territory , ' when asked about the @entity0 suggestion .			2
