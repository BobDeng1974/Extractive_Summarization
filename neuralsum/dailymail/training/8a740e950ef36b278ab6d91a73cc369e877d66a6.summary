would you like to know your medical future ? in five years most @entity2 will be able to find out if they will develop cancer , diabetes , heart and other diseases , through a medical breakthrough - genomic testing			1
@entity2 will no longer need to send their blood samples overseas for genomic testing , as the @entity10 , one the country 's largest medical research institutions , will soon have the analysis available to patients			1
in five years most @entity2 will be able to find out if they will develop cancer , diabetes , heart and other diseases , through a medical breakthrough - genomic testing @entity2 will no longer need to send their blood samples overseas for genomic testing , as the @entity10 , one the country 's largest medical research institutions , will soon have the analysis available after registering through the @entity22 , within the next 12 months genetic testing will be available to @entity2 seeking the analysis			1
professor @entity23 , executive director at @entity10 , said that ' once in a generation something comes along that completely changes society ' ' once in a generation something comes along that completely changes society ' , professor @entity23 , executive director at @entity10 , told @entity30			2
' this is the equivalent of the introduction of vaccination in the twentieth century			0
' the first @entity2 to benefit from these tests will be cancer patients , with oncologists now able to send samples for genomic testing within twelve months			1
but genome testing has only been made possible after the @entity10 received their last ten illumina gene sequencing machines , cutting the cost of genome sequencing down to $ us1 , 000			1
these cuts have allowed the institute to be able to financially afford the tests , with genome testing costing them under $ au2 , 000 , professor @entity23 said			2
he also believes that if a large amount of people seek out these tests then the price may possible reduce to just several hundred dollars within the next five years			1
now @entity10 is submitting a request to get @entity54 funding , providing evidence that genome testing may save the health system millions			1
patients with pancreatic cancer have been found hard to treat , who according to @entity10 has the same genetic mutations that cause breast and bowel cancer			2
this discovery could be life saving - along with the genome testing - with cancer no longer being described by the organ it appears in , but by the genetic mutation that causes it			0
@entity70 's @entity72 hospital has already begun trailing out genome testing , in the hope to find out the cause of intellectual disabilities in children			0
after registering through the @entity22 , within the next 12 months genetic testing will be available to @entity2 seeking the analysis nearly 80 per cent of these problems can not be not known with the use of traditional diagnostic procedures			1
' we ’re spending thousands of dollars on unproductive diagnostic odysseys trying to find out what ’s wrong and many parents never get an answer , ' professor @entity23 said			0
with the introduction to genome testing in @entity2 , genetic and rare problems in children may see a possible treatment after a common problem is mapped out			2
but this breakthrough does not go without practical and ethical difficulties			0
people may find it hard knowing they have a life threatening problem , especially when it comes to employers and insurers discriminating against them			0
but the @entity103 insist that health insurers are not able to refuse insurance to anyone who is predisposed to a fatal condition			0
people who chose to have a genome test down , must report it to their health insurance			0
@entity70 's @entity72 hospital has already begun trailing out genome testing , in the hope to find out the cause of intellectual disabilities in children			0

genomic testing will be made available in @entity2 within the next 12 months
@entity10 have registered the tests through the @entity22 of @entity122
@entity2 will no longer need to send their blood samples overseas for genomic testing
in five years time , it could cost as little as a few hundred dollars for a genomic test
