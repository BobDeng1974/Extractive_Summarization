by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 09:37 est , 4 july 2012 updated : 06:55 est , 5 july 2012 a frail 84 - year - old @entity3 's sufferer was put in handcuffs because a policeman feared for his own safety			2
@entity7 became confused and frightened when health workers made a decision , without his family present , to put him in hospital			1
terrified and alone , he was then strapped into a stretcher and handcuffed			2
@entity13 : @entity3 's sufferer @entity7 , from @entity15 , @entity16 , pictured with his nephew 's wife @entity17 , was put in handcuffs because a policeman feared for his own safety police later said the decision was taken to protect mr @entity7 , the police , ambulance staff and the public			1
but last night the force 's chief constable said the presence of an officer was ' inappropriate '			1
the degrading treatment was yesterday described by his family and experts as ' inhumane ' and ' unforgivable ' and they say the stress of the incident may even have contributed to his death the following month			2
at mr @entity7 's inquest on monday , coroner @entity38 attacked pc @entity40 for his heavy - handed approach , telling him : ' this is totally ridiculous , officer , it beggars belief			1
mr @entity7 was an elderly , frail and frightened man with little understanding of the world around him and what would happen to him			1
' the nightmare for the retired design engineer began in march last year at his home in @entity15 , @entity16			2
at the time , mr @entity7 's wife , @entity52 , was in a care home and he lived alone			1
mr @entity7 received regular care from local health workers but they decided his condition had deteriorated to the point where he needed to be sectioned			1
his daughter , @entity58 , 52 , a local trading standards officer , had been due to accompany her father to hospital but the meeting was moved forward by 24 hours and mrs @entity58 was unable to attend			2
' little understanding of the world around him ' : mr @entity7 , pictured in 2008 with wife @entity52 and daughter @entity58 , had been sectioned under the @entity65 when he was handcuffed by police upset : mr @entity7 's daughter , @entity58 ( pictured ) , who was absent when her father was sectioned , has criticised the way he was treated no support : health workers had been due to meet mrs @entity58 at mr @entity7 's home ( above ) to discuss his health , but the appointment was moved forward 24 hours and she was unable to attend health workers went ahead with their decision to send mr @entity7 to hospital without mrs @entity58 present			1
instead , he was left in the hands of medical staff he did not know increasing his fear and agitation			0
once inside the back of the ambulance he was strapped to a stretcher causing him more distress			2
as mr @entity7 attempted to free himself , the officer on board handcuffed him claiming he feared for his safety , the medical staff on board and members of the public			1
mr @entity7 was taken to @entity93 , @entity16 , on march 3 last year where he stayed for six days before being transferred to the @entity95 in @entity96 where he suffered a fall			1
he eventually died in april last year			2
' @entity98 , kind and honest ' : mrs @entity58 , pictured with her father on her wedding day in 1986 , said he was treasured by his family an inquest was required because he fell at the hospital			0
at the inquest , mr @entity38 added the decisioon to section mr @entity7 without his daughter , @entity58 , being present was ' ill considered '			1
he said he would write to the chief constable over the training of officers in dealing with mental health patients , in particular in the use of handcuffs			1
speaking after the inquest at @entity116 court where a verdict of accidental death was recorded , mr @entity7 's daugter said the way in which her father was treated was ' deplorable '			1
mrs @entity58 said : ' i believe his death was partly down to the stress of what happened			0
not only the excessive use of force , but to send a policeman to accompany him was unbelievable			0
' when i went to see him in hospital he was black and blue			0
i could n't believe the state of him and he could n't tell me what had happened			0
he was approaching 85 and only weighed around seven stone			0
' i 'm really angry about the whole situation			0
the manner in which the mental health workers and the police came in showed no consideration for him or me			1
' they kept saying it was for his own well - being but they caused him so much distress and anxiety by removing him from his home of 62 years			0
' mrs @entity58 said : ' there was no need to handcuff him			0
my dad was so frail			0
why on earth did they handcuff him ? to send a policeman to accompany him was unbelievable			0
' the way my father was treated was inhumane and i will stand by that for the rest of my life			0
it 's been deplorable from the minute the mental health people started dealing with my dad			2
i will never ever forgive them for what happened			0
' detective chief inspector @entity159 , of @entity160 , said : ' handcuffs were used to prevent mr @entity7 harming himself , the police officer , medical staff in the ambulance and members of the public on the road			1
' anybody would have got into a panic if they were suddenly handcuffed , least of all someone with @entity3 's			0
' @entity172 , patient concern ' due to mr @entity7 's demeanour and age , attempts at physically restraining him may have led to mr @entity176 sustaining serious injuries , therefore handcuffs were deemed the safest and most reasonable option in the circumstances			1
' but yesterday sir @entity181 , chief constable of the force , admitted a police officer should never have been present to restrain mr @entity7 describing what happened as ' inappropriate			1
' @entity185 , of @entity186 , said : ' the moving forward of a meeting by health workers which in effect excluded mr @entity7 's daughter would suggest this was a serious contributing factor to the appalling treatment he was subjected to			1
family members need to be involved and listened to at all times			0
' the tragic story regarding mr @entity7 and his family shows that there is still continuing widespread lack of education and understanding around dementia			1
' it also highlights a number of mistakes , not just in the totally inappropriate handcuffing by the police			2
' @entity172 , of @entity173 , said : ' this is absolutely disgraceful			0
i ca n't imagine how this happened			0
' people with @entity3 's need calming down and they need to have people they know around them			0
i ca n't understand why they did n't wait for the daughter to get home			0
@entity216 would have got into a panic if they were suddenly handcuffed , least of all someone with @entity3 's			0
' @entity220 , medical director for @entity221 said : ' arrangements were in place to assess mr @entity7 with his daughter present but due to a rapid deterioration in his health , the assessment was conducted earlier to prevent further harm			1
' @entity229 is a specialist mental health unit providing care and treatment for older people suffering with mental health issues and as such , was an appropriate place for mr @entity7 to receive the care he needed			1
' earlier this year police were condemned after they fired tasers at terrified @entity3 's sufferer , @entity240 , 58 , who struggled when he was being taken to hospital			2
six officers were called and to his @entity245 home and he was shot with several taser stun rounds , before being manhandled to the floor .			0

@entity7 was tied to stretcher in an ambulance after being sectioned
when he became distressed and tried to escape , a pc restrained him
coroner tells officer : ' this is totally ridiculous . '
he will write to @entity160 about its treatment
but chief constable hits back over ' inappropriate ' use of police
coroner also blasts decision by @entity266 to section mr @entity7
mr @entity7 died at a mental health unit weeks later after an unconnected fall
