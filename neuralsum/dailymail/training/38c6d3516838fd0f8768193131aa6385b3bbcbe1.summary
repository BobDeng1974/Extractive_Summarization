by @entity0 published : 22:39 est , 7 november 2013 updated : 03:32 est , 8 november 2013 @entity1 is to close some bank branches and move them in to @entity4 supermarkets in a new ‘ open all hours ’ approach			1
eight will be switched during 2014 , while more will follow in a policy that is expected to be taken up by the other mainstream banks			1
the move will save @entity1 a fortune because it will be able to sell off existing buildings , however it could upset and disrupt many loyal customers			2
at the same time it could harm existing high streets , where retailers would lose the passing trade associated with people visiting bank branches and cash machines			1
closures : @entity1 is to close eight branches across the @entity23 next year with more to follow ( stock image ) there also concerns that the range of services , particularly to small businesses , will be curtailed			1
on a positive note , the new supermarket bank branches will open for the same hours as the supermarket , seven days a week , which is longer than normal			1
staff will only be on duty during normal bank hours , however there will be machines in place at other times to allow people to do simple things like pay bills and pay in or take out cash			1
@entity1 also insisted that services to small businesses in terms of paying in a large number of cheques , or withdrawing large cash sums will be maintained			0
the move by @entity1 follows an earlier decision by the @entity50 to move many of its outlets in to branches of @entity54 , which has not been entirely successful			2
customers have complained of a lack of staff and long queues at some outlets			0
the first @entity1 branch to go is in the @entity62 shopping centre in @entity63 , where services and staff will move to a nearby @entity4 in february			1
the next three to close will be in @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 street , @entity70 , @entity71 , and @entity72 , @entity73			0
@entity74 , @entity75 and @entity76 said the change will help people to shop and bank at the same time			0
longer hours : the closed branches will be relocated in @entity4 stores and will operate the same opening hours as the supermarket ‘ we ’ve spoken to our customers who use our everyday and business banking services in our branches and they ’ve told us their time is precious so would benefit from being able to multi-task , park easily and visit branches with longer opening hours , ’ he said @entity4 ’s @entity96 , said : ‘ this is the next step in the evolution of how we continue to make our stores relevant to our customers ’ everyday needs , giving them access to banking services to use at their convenience – when they want , and how they want it			1
‘ access to banking services is an under - rated but important asset to any community but in many areas , these services just are n't available to families			0
in partnership with @entity1 , we ’ll trial banking services in our stores for the communities which need it the most			0
’ the campaign for @entity118 fears high streets could lose out once the branches close			2
director , @entity121 , said : ‘ if relocation to an @entity4 is the alternative to losing the branch altogether it has to be welcomed and clearly will reduce costs for @entity1			2
‘ however , a big question is whether the in - store outlet will provide the same transactional services to small businesses and charities as the conventional branch			0
‘ also , location is important and many large supermarkets these days are sited away from the traditional high streets			0
what we see when banks pull out of local high streets is serious loss of business by other retailers as people and businesses from the surrounding area no longer come into the high street to bank and therefore no longer spend locally			1
’ previous experiments with moving banks in to other retailers have not been successful			0
@entity150 tried it with @entity4 between 1997 and 2002 , while @entity152 did something similar with @entity154			2
all the outlets subsequently closed .			0

eight branches will be switched during 2014 with more to follow
the new @entity4 bank branches will open for the same hours as the supermarket , which is longer than normal
but retailers fear the move could harm the high street
