the campaign staff running his @entity4 feed posted two pictures of both mr @entity3 and mr @entity5 in the midst of a water gun battle			1
in the first photo , president @entity3 is in a baseball cap and shorts , running around a pool and wielding an orange and white gun			1
in the second , mr @entity5 is taking aim at an unknown target while wearing sunglasses			2
it appears that he is at a children ’s birthday party			0
straight shooter : vice president @entity5 tweeted two pictures of he and president @entity3 , pictured , playing with water guns outnumbered : @entity5 is seen surrounded by water gun - toting children mr @entity5 ’s tweets – which are run by the @entity3 2012 campaign staff , unless specifically noted – begin with several tweets of his schedule			1
then came the tweet with the @entity39 photos			0
along with the pictures , he writes : ‘ @entity42 photos , volume one			1

put ' er there ! mr @entity5 tweeted a picture of him and the president high - fiving in a gymnasium only yesterday , the internet took to scrutinising mr @entity3 ’s seemingly diminished frame			2
an image of him topping @entity67 said under it that mr @entity3 was ‘ thin and wasting away			0
’ @entity70 - eyed @entity4 users were quick to come up with snarky comments			0
@entity73 ’s @entity72 responded : ‘ @entity74 lets ( @entity3 ) run around the pool ! ? ! ’ @entity78 ’ @entity77 took it one step further , incorporating the popular meme of @entity82 texting with her sunglasses on , and writing : ‘ for the last time , you are not @entity86			0
