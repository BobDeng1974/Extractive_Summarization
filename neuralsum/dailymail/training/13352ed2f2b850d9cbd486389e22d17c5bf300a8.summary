by @entity0 a new survey has revealed the most costly regions around the country in which to hire a babysitter , with @entity6 at the top of totem pole , closely followed by @entity9 and @entity10			0
@entity11 , a site which allows parents to source local babysitters , polled more than 7,000 families across nine large metro city areas and concluded that the national average wage for babysitting one child is $ 14.97 per hour			1
@entity6 fork out hourly wages of around $ 15.34 for one child , running up to $ 18.74 for three children , whereas in @entity22 , it 's more in the region of $ 10.84 for one child and $ 14.24 for a trio			1
expensive night out : a study by @entity26 has revealed that @entity6 babysitters charge the most , an average of $ 15.34 an hour for one child , compared with @entity22 , where $ 10.84 an hour is more the norm @entity30 , a social media director and mother - of - three , tells @entity33 she pays up to $ 25 an hour for ' quality ' sitters , who wo n't just stick her kids , all under the age of five , in front of the television			1
the busy working mom was in for rather a surprise , however , during a recent family trip to @entity43			0
' we found a babysitter based on a friend ’s recommendation			0
they only paid around $ 8 or $ 10			1
my husband and i looked at each other and said , " oh my gosh , " because we pay double that for our kids ' , she says			0
the same study also found that 26 per cent of parents polled hire a babysitter once a week or more , and that nearly half are spending upwards of $ 1,000 a year on the privilege			1
how much for @entity61 ? the 24 star , ( left ) famously revealed he used to babysit actress @entity63 ( right ) way back in the day when she was a pre-teen it might just be a factor in the trend that more women now choose to be stay - at - home moms than at any other time in the past two decades , according to a recent @entity70 report			0
and mothers who do work are paying more than ever for childcare ; both for daycare - a 70 per cent increase nationwide since 1985 , inflation taken into account - and for irregular babysitting			1
again , costs for full - time daycare vary quite significantly according to where you live ; @entity6 unsurprisingly topping the list again at a cost of $ 12,355 annually , and @entity9 coming in cheapest at $ 9,240			1
and all that does n't take tipping into account , with over 70 per cent of parents in @entity26 's survey saying they tipped their babysitters			1
' you ca n’t really put a price on people taking care of your kids ' it appears families are n't sticking with their sitters for very long either , with a high turnover rate reported , and less than six per cent of families saying they 've kept the same sitter for more than five years			1
interestingly , for the platinum credit card wielding parents of @entity6 , it seems many are actually uncomfortable when prices seem too low			1
@entity105 , founder of @entity26 , admits the service was initially free when it launched , which led @entity6 to be suspicious			0
' when we started charging [ from $ 8.35 a month ] , our numbers actually went up in @entity6 , ' she told @entity109 last year			1
ultimately , for ms jimeson , the mother willing to pay up to $ 25 an hour for good service , the prices are worth it			2
' it ’s pretty incredible just how high [ the costs are ] here , ' she remarks			0
' at the same time , you ca n’t really put a price on people taking care of your kids			0
@entity6 $ 15.34 $ 18.74 2			2
