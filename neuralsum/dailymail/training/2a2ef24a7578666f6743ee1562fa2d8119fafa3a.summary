she said : ‘ once you would have an argument with your boyfriend on the phone in the hallway and then you would have to get back to chatting with your family where you could think things over			0
now with @entity37 , @entity38 , snapchat and smart phones it is 24/7			0
' there is no let up and no natural break to think			0
often people feel down and do n’t vocalise that for fear of being marked as mentally ill. it means they can take themselves off in a moment of darkness and do what they do			2
’ @entity10 took her own life in december last year on an ' act of impulse ' after becoming concerned it would be difficult to have the same friends as her ex-boyfriend if either of them was to start dating another person the teenager ( pictured when she was younger with her father @entity65 ) was a popular schoolgirl with a keen interest in sports miss @entity10 's parents , @entity69 and @entity65 ( pictured left with @entity10 ) , are now raising money for the charity @entity71 which campaigns to reduce the stigma associated with suicide			1

she was an out - going capable person with good upbringing and we just did n’t expect this			2
‘ one of our neighbours put it aptly “ if @entity10 could do it , then it could happen to any family			2
” but sadly , like a lot of young people she took a temporary problem and gave a permanent solution to it			0
‘ this is the nature of her age group who often tend to see things as black and white when they have n’t got the maturity to deal with things troubling them			0
in a moment of darkness they act irrationally			0
’ she said talking about being suicidal is wrongly a ‘ taboo ’ topic			0
‘ being able to say you feel down or feeling like you might do something silly should not have the stigma surrounding it that it currently does			0
‘ for @entity10 , all rational thought had gone			2
all it might have taken was to speak to someone about what was bothering her			0
something needs to be done to remove the stigma that says it is odd just to say “ i am feeling down			0

‘ before @entity10 had done what she had done , i was completely unaware of this - but the reality is it has never been a comfortable thing for humans to talk about			1
it seems people feel so black that they see no options			0
