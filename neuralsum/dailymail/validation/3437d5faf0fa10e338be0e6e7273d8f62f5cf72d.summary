as the second @entity2 training session of the week wound down on tuesday , a number of giddy international footballers lined up at the edge of the penalty box for a bit of shooting practice			1
@entity12 , showing no ill - effects from the thigh injury which had threatened his involvement , made a beeline for the head of the queue , while @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 all waited their turn to receive a pass from @entity25 and fire a volley at one of the four goalkeepers in the squad			2
taking his place at the end of the line was new boy @entity33			1
@entity33 celebrates his goal against @entity35 during @entity37 's 3 - 0 victory on saturday the 25 - year - old has bided his time to reach this juncture in his career , so he could wait another few moments to take on @entity43 between the sticks			1
up he stepped and , with his new teammates watching on , the @entity37 star found the net			1
it was greeted with roars of delight and the shots kept coming			2
@entity33 may have been happy to take his place at the back of the queue but he will put his best foot forward to earn a place in @entity57 's plans for @entity58 on sunday			1
' i 've been picked because the manager was impressed with the way i play and if i come here and i 'm not confident , then i wo n't show the best of my ability , ' explained @entity33			1
' so be yourself , that 's what you 're picked for			0
' it was a little bit nerve - wrecking meeting the lads for the first time but i 've settled in really quick and they made me feel welcome			0
as much as it 's daunting the first time , as soon as you find your feet and introduce yourself it 's normal really			0
' @entity74 defender @entity73 competes for the ball with @entity76 forward @entity77 in @entity78 @entity2 assistant manager @entity79 watches on during his side 's session on monday @entity2 manager @entity57 ( sixth left ) addresses his squad in @entity83 on monday @entity57 had a brief chat with his latest recruit before the session to see if he knew any of those involved in the squad , but @entity33 is coming in with no previous relationships built up			1
he is n't a total outsider , though			0
the @entity92 - born midfielder , whose grandparents hail from @entity94 , represented @entity95 at @entity96 and @entity97 level and always pined for the green jersey over the three lions , despite advances from @entity102 to join their underage set - up when he was a promising academy player at @entity104			1
' i chose my country then and that was to stay with @entity2			1
they gave me the opportunity to play at international level at 15 and i was really thankful for that			2
i learned a lot from that experience and from then on i was always going to stick with @entity2			1
' on his last appearance for the @entity116 in 2007 , he was sent off against @entity117 , and his club career also took a nose dive when he was released by @entity104 and dropped out of the @entity120 to rebuild his confidence with @entity122			0
' playing international football was out of the question			0
in my head , it was n't even something i spoke about , ' @entity33 , who has a solid sounding board in brother - in - law and former @entity102 international @entity130 , remembered			2
then he signed for @entity37 five years ago and the club have risen to top of the @entity132 with @entity33 a key component of their midfield			1
@entity37 midfielder @entity33 ( left ) holds off the challenge of @entity35 's @entity136 on saturday ' realistically , i think this is the best time for me to come			1
it 's the best time i 've been ready for the opportunity			0
as much as it was at the back of my mind a few years ago , it was something i was hoping for in the recent months			0
' @entity33 's experience of life in the doldrums has helped shape his current outlook on the game and fighting his way back from obscurity means he is now relishing rather than fearing the next stage in his career			2
' there are probably loads of players who go to non-league and end up staying there			0
' it 's easy , when you 're down at that level , to blame other things or point the finger at other people as to why you are there , but there 's a reason for it , you have failed at the level you were at and you have to prove yourself again			2
' one thing i felt i had to do was work hard , and i am doing that now , working hard to try and achieve my goals			0
the key to success is working hard			0
' ' @entity176 is a top player and he 's at the level that i want to eventually get to , ' he continued			2
' these players have earned the right to play in the @entity180 and have the international experience which i have n't had yet			0
i still have a bit of learning to do			0
