in order to become a policewoman , a candidate must be aged 17.5 - 22 years , follow a religion , be at least 5ft5in , not need glasses and : be a virgin			0
female force : @entity2 wannabe policewomen must be aged 17.5 - 22 years , follow a recognised religion , be at least 5ft5in tall , not need glasses and , astonishingly enough , be a virgin ' in addition to the medical and physical tests , women who want to be policewomen must also undergo virginity tests , so all women who want to become policewomen should keep their virginity , ' the @entity2 police states on its website			1
however , according to a report by @entity35 , a number of applicants were only told of the test moments before it was about to take place			2
' i felt embarrassed , nervous , but i could n't refuse , ' a 2013 applicant told the @entity35 according to @entity40			0
' if i had refused , i could n't have become a policewoman			0
' according to another female applicant , the tests have seen the aspiring police officers undress in front of 20 other candidates before being led into a room without a door , in pairs			1
there , in the company of the other applicants , the women were subjected to internal examinations to determine if they were virgins			2
humiliating : female applicants were forced to undress in front of 20 other candidates before being led into a room without a door in pairs , where the ' virginity tests ' took place ' the @entity62 's use of virginity tests is a discriminatory practice that harms and humiliates women , ' said @entity66 , associate women 's rights director at @entity35			1
' applicants who failed the test were not necessarily expelled from the force , but women described the test as painful and traumatic			2
' the practice , which is supposed to determine if the candidate 's hymen is intact , has been widely discredited as unscientific and degrading			0
a spokesman for the national police confirmed virginity tests still happened but that there was no requirement for female candidates to be virgins			2
' there is a complete health test for both female and male candidates including checking reproductive organs and the virginity test for women will be a part of that routine , ' said @entity91			1
' but there has never has been a rule that requires policewomen to be virgins , so there is no discrimination			0
' one candidate , who had undergone the test and asked to remain anonymous , said she agreed with it in principle			0
' i do n't have a problem with the test ... but the way in which it was conducted , with many people in one room , violated our privacy , ' she said .			0
