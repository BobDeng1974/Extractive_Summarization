standing in a public shower cubicle with my screaming 15 - month - old son , i was starting to wonder whether i truly was a @entity3 type of person			2
my hazy memories of similar family holidays as a child were of slow days spent on pine - scented campsites , punctuated by trips to sun - soaked beaches			1
but here i was , a fully - fledged father , some quarter of a century later wondering what had gone wrong			2
our journey to @entity15 on @entity18 ’s @entity17 coast went without a hitch , despite being in the minority of travellers flying , then hiring a car , rather than driving all the way			1
but the fatal decision was to try and wash the children , toddler @entity26 and five - year - old @entity27 , after arriving in a tired and tetchy state at @entity29			2
@entity30 stayed at @entity31 with his wife , @entity33 , and children , @entity26 and @entity27 families congregated around the pools every afternoon for relief from the august heat it was at this point i discovered that we did n’t have any hot water and the baby bath had a big hole in the bottom and no plug			1
with stubborn determination i slung the youngest over my shoulder , grabbed some towels and trudged off to the shower block			0
minutes later he had showed me the error of my ways in the way that only toddlers can			0
and this was something i was left to chew over , as we quickly realised neither stubbornness nor determination have a place in this land of dappled sunlight , flip - flops and fresh baguettes			0
the children spent plenty of time in the pool , playing with the many new friends they made @entity26 wears oversized sunglasses while relaxing by the pool at @entity31 in @entity15 instead over the next 10 days we threw ourselves at the mercy of campsite life , simply taking the path of least resistance			1
with hindsight , we should , of course , on that first night have just thrown the children into bed – dirt and all – and gone swimming first thing			1
@entity81 ( which has since absorbed @entity82 under its banner ) , and its stable of mobile home accommodation , provide everything you need to make a great success of simple pleasures like these			0
things have come on a long way since i was a foot shorter and my family holidayed every year in tents across the south - west of @entity18			1
the @entity97 family made several trips to the pleasant @entity15 beach with its mountain backdrop multiple swimming pools , a kids club , swings and a bakery kept the @entity106 busy during their stay lugging jerry cans of water back to our tent with its zip - up compartments and constant procession of ants had its charm , but so does double - glazing , a fully - fitted kitchen and air conditioning			1
we stayed in a @entity122 three - bedroom mobile home			0
it ’s not huge , the bedrooms have the feel of a ship cabin , but it ’s all there			0
the shower is decent with plenty of hot water – once the boiler has been sparked into life by a handy courier – and you ’ve got your own loo and a decent size fridge			2
two sets of doors lead out on to a deck , equipped with a gas - fired barbecue and , in our case , a permanent al fresco bath for @entity26			0
camping @entity29 's biggest selling point is a fantastic swimming pool complex , including two water slides @entity81 offer sites for all types and tastes , and @entity149 is probably quite typical of a modern @entity18 campsite			1
this is certainly not your isolated enclave where you spend the evening listening only to the cicadas and warm wind rustling through the trees			0
instead , you are likely to be able to hear the distant sounds of a @entity158 murdering a 1980s pop classic at karaoke night at the bar			0
but it ’s a trade - off if you want somewhere lively and family orientated , which this campsite certainly is			2
in @entity29 ’s case , the biggest selling point is the fantastic swimming pool complex , including two water slides			1
there is even a heated pool with a retractable roof , under which we spent a memorable afternoon sheltering from a thunderstorm that rolled in from the @entity173			1
@entity26 and @entity174 , pictured with dad @entity30 , enjoyed the kids club , run by a team of dedicated workers families congregated around the pools every afternoon for relief from the august heat and @entity27 became an almost permanent fixture in the water , playing with the many new friends she ’d made on the site			1
so the pool became a mainstay of our pleasant daily routine , which began with picking up freshly baked bread from the campsite bakery and ended with drinks and snacks on the deck			2
we quickly made use of the kids club , run by a small team of dedicated and enthusiastic couriers			0
four hours of varied entertainment is on offer for children aged five to 12 , six days of the week , and during our stay those in charge worked hard to build a rapport with their young charges from @entity207 , @entity208 , @entity158 and @entity209			0
@entity30 and @entity33 get into the spirit at @entity213 's campsite ' @entity211 ' for children @entity27 enjoyed games , crafts and an x-factor - style talent show as the club proved a hub for families staying with @entity82 and its sister company @entity81			1
the two tribes were ultimately set against each other with an evening campsite ‘ @entity211 ’ , at which i am sad to report @entity81 cleaned up			0
but not before our children had soaked their couriers to the skin in a bizarre game involving body paint , shouting and many , many bottles of water			2
as the days went on we settled into a pleasant routine , padding about the site between the bakery , kids club , swings and swimming pools			2
we did venture off site most mornings , making the 10 - minute walk to the pleasant @entity15 beach with its mountain backdrop and host of accessible cafes , bars and a mini-supermarket			1
when the @entity106 were n't in the pool they spent time on the beach in the stunning port of @entity253 a little further afield was the stunning port of @entity253 , once a magnet for artists including @entity257 and @entity258			1
it really is a picture postcard place , with a little bay and beach perfect for swimming , surrounded by traditional @entity18 cafes , restaurants and arts and crafts boutiques			1
we went back twice to make sure we had n’t missed anything in its winding maze of pretty streets			0
once my wife and i found a new rhythm we pretty much all agreed that we could be @entity3 kind of people			0
we vowed never to force @entity26 to take a shower ever again though – at least not until he is big enough to take himself			0
@entity30 and his family stayed at @entity149 , @entity15 , for 10 nights with @entity278 ( www.eurocamp.co.uk or 0844 406 0319 ) , which now operates under the @entity81 banner			1
@entity81 offer self - catering holidays at more than 160 sites across @entity283 , including popular regions like the @entity285 , @entity209 and central @entity286			0
from may 25 , 2015 , a seven - night stay in a two - bedroom @entity289 mobile home at @entity149 starts at £ 427			0
peak season flights with @entity291 to @entity292 from @entity293 start at £ 65 each way , plus baggage			0
@entity30 hired a car with @entity297 , which cost around £ 250 for 10 days , including two child seats and unlimited mileage .			1

@entity30 travelled with his family to @entity15 , @entity18
it offers water slides and a heated pool with a retractable roof
@entity308 , located *nearby* , has a beach perfect for swimming
