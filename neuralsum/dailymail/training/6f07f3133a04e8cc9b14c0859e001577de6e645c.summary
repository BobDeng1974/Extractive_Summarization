' it scared me because i absolutely saw and knew my entire future			0
' the @entity52 - born designer , who was only 25 at the time , told out magazine in 2011 that it was ' love at first sight ' and that he decided he would marry mr @entity3 , then 38 , ' in the length of an elevator ride , ' following their whirlwind first few encounters			1
