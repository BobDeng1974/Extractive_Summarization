long months followed until the seven - year - old 's body was found in a field the following @entity24			1
it was worse than could have been expected : she had been choked with a wire and stabbed			2
her family hoped that the killer would be brought to justice quickly but in the end they had to wait - an astonishing 55 years for justice			2
the coldest case in @entity10 history was finally closed in 2012 when @entity37 's killer was convicted using a deathbed confession by his mother that had re-opened the investigation			1
her family had to wait from 1957 until 2012 to see the case closed convicted : @entity1 ( left as a teenager ) was 73 ( right in a police mugshot ) when he was jailed for the murder of @entity1 55 years previously			1

' @entity65 ' , based on a book of the same name , will be shown tonight ( @entity68 ) on the @entity69			0
it stitches together the events that took place in @entity45 , @entity9 , a tiny farming community of 7,000 people that would never be the same again after families and friends turned against each other in the hunt for the killer			1

he said : ' it 's an epic story of crime and family that spans five decades			0
what 's extraordinary is how this single event changed so many years so many years later			0
' people alive in @entity45 , @entity9 in 1957 remember the night @entity37 was kidnapped the way the rest of us remember where we were on 9/11 , or , for an older generation , the @entity105 assassination			1
it 's with you forever			0
' beyond that , the case made legal history			0
never before had a criminal case from such a distant past ever been brought to justice in a criminal court in @entity10			2
' @entity86 , who is also executive producer of @entity115 , added that the case was so compelling because it ' opened the door ' to @entity45 's dark past			1

but there were all these secrets			0

another 14 years passed until 2008 when the @entity9 state police finally reopened the case at the request of @entity83 's half sister @entity199			1

during his lifetime he also been in the @entity183 , the @entity205 and worked as a @entity52 state police officer			0
in 2012 @entity37 's body was exhumed and his trial went ahead , heavily relying on witnesses who tried their best to recall events more than half a century old			2
long road : @entity212 and @entity213 , the brother and sister of @entity37 , who had waited 55 years for their sibling 's murderer , @entity83 , to be brought to justice and said : ' now @entity37 is at peace			1
' serviceman : @entity83 served in the @entity183 and @entity205 and went on to be a @entity52 policeman			2

it was almost certainly taken after he murdered @entity1			0
portrait of a killer : @entity83 was painted nude in the 1980s for this image , around 30 years after he murdered the seven - year - old @entity1 the key testimony came from @entity149 , a childhood friend of @entity37 's who was with her until moments before she disappeared			1
she was shown an old photograph of @entity83 and identified him as ' @entity20 '			0
she recalled how she ran up and down the snow covered street before dashing home to tell her family : ' @entity37 's lost ! i ca n't find @entity37 ! ' now 63 , @entity149 was just eight at the time it happened			2
@entity199 also told the court about her mother 's confession and after @entity83 refused to give evidence he was found guilty			1
before the sentencing prosecutor , @entity251 said that @entity83 had ' left a lifetime of emotional wreckage in his wake '			0

now there was a true boogeyman living among them			0
he is the definition of evil			0

but speaking after the hearing , @entity37 's older brother @entity213 said he was ' satisfied ' with the sentence			0
he said : ' this is all we could expect			0
now @entity37 is finally at peace			0
' the conviction also gave observers a chance to look again at the missed chances to prosecute @entity83 which could have brought about justice sooner			2
@entity86 told @entity88 that the case took so long to come to court because it was a ' mess ' from the beginning			0
he said : ' the original investigation was afflicted by police dysfunction and incompetence			0
there were issues of jurisdiction			0
' who was in charge ? the @entity64 ? the state police			2
? the local authorities ? ' everybody found it hard to believe that the crime could have been committed by a local boy			0
' interest : @entity63 , then @entity293 , ( left ) and president @entity163 ( right ) were both reportedly updated on the case of the missing seven - year - old , reflecting the shock felt in 1950s @entity10 at the crime @entity297 reported : the story was headline news not just in @entity300 , @entity9 , but across the country earlier this year @entity83 , now 74 , filed an 80 - page appeal saying there was no forensic evidence tying him to the crime			1
he says that since it happened so long ago there was no way the witnesses could remember what they saw			0
the appeal states : ' the evidence against @entity1 , was so unreasonable , so improbable , and so unsatisfactory as to create a reasonable doubt that he was responsible for a 1957 murder , kidnapping , and abduction of an infant			2
' the hearing will be held on december 3 - with deep irony , 57 years to the day since @entity37 went missing .			0
