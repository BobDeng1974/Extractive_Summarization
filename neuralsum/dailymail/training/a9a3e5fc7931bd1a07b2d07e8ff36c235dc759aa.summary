ten @entity1 and five majors but will @entity0 ever be captain ? with a record like that , nobody gets overlooked normally but i understand the mood among @entity8 officials was undiluted fury after his public questioning of @entity13 ’s stewardship on sunday night			1
the mind went back to the @entity15 and sir @entity17 ’s weird stint as captain			0
when he came in for understandably hostile questioning at a press conference afterwards , @entity19 leapt to his defence			0
@entity0 was clear and specific in his criticism of @entity25 @entity24 captain @entity13 on sunday @entity0 ( centre ) looks despondent after @entity27 collect the @entity24 trophy against @entity25 on sunday this was the same @entity19 dropped by @entity17 from the saturday afternoon session			1
he was on his way to equalling @entity33 ’s record of 12 matches unbeaten when he was told on the 10th tee that he would not play after lunch			0
you can imagine what he thought privately about that crass piece of timing			0
yet did @entity19 use that as a stick to beat @entity17 in public ? not in a million years			0
sadly , @entity0 ’s ego could not cope with being dropped for two saturday sessions			1
yes , he should have played in the afternoon ; yes it was one more daft thing @entity13 did			1
indeed , everything @entity0 said in the most dramatic press conference imaginable made sense but you can not humiliate your captain in such a setting			1
it was a terrible act of betrayal			0
it left @entity57 , the @entity8 president , with his head in his hands at the back of the room			0
he should have been leaping to his feet in defence of the man he chose to lead the team			0
indeed , you kept waiting for one player or official to speak up and say this was not the time or forum to be conducting an inquest			0
it said much about what the players felt about a captain who was foisted upon them by @entity57 and who was hopelessly out of touch			1
at 65 , who would not be ? @entity0 , speaking in a press conference after @entity27 has secured victory at @entity85 , claimed @entity25 captain @entity13 had ' strayed from a winning formula ' and compared his unfavourably to 2008 leader @entity88			1
he said : ' there were two things that allowed us to play our best that @entity88 did			1
' first , he got everybody invested in the process			0
he got everybody invested in who they were going to play with , who the picks were going to be , who was going to be in their ' pod ' , when they would play , and they had a great leader for each pod			0
' the other things that @entity88 did really well was he had a game plan for us - how we were going to go about doing this , how we were going to go about playing together , if so - and - so is playing well , if so - and - so is not playing well			1
' those two things helped us bring out our best golf			0
we use that same process in the @entity111 and we do really well			0
' unfortunately we have strayed from a winning formula for the last three @entity1 and we need to consider maybe getting back to that formula that helped us play our best			1
' asked if he believed his comments were disloyal to @entity13 , he replied : ' i 'm sorry you 're taking it that way			2
i 'm just talking about what @entity88 did to help us play our best			2
' @entity13 responded to the claims by suggesting that the format should be changed in future years @entity0 says the @entity25 should return to the tactics which helped @entity88 's team win in 2008 @entity0 was spot - on when he intimated the @entity25 display was a car crash you could see coming a mile off			1
how many times did you read in these pages in the lead - up to the event about how @entity13 seemed dogged by bad luck and bad judgment ? it started when he went against his own philosophy of picking in - form wildcards by choosing the hapless @entity137 over the impressive @entity138			2
the brilliant performance of @entity140 in the @entity141 , another on the outside looking in , was one more psychological blow in the build - up when @entity25 could not afford any			2
@entity13 capped it by dropping @entity146 and @entity147 from friday afternoon ’s foursomes after their morning performance had electrified the @entity25			1
@entity1 are all about momentum and that killed it stone dead			2
there are some things the @entity25 must get right if they are to end their run of eight losses in 10 matches			2
for a start , the @entity141 should be used to identify the hot players going into a @entity24			1
they have also got to pick a @entity163 captain in touch with his players and prepared to put in the hard graft to get the fine detail right			2
@entity168 would be perfect but because he has not won a major and does not sell tickets when you are announcing wildcards with a @entity173 - style production , he probably has no chance			0
the @entity25 look glum as @entity27 stormed to victory at @entity85 with a confident set of singles matches @entity13 was congratulating @entity27 before five o'clock as the hosts secured the win early on @entity25 have also been served wretchedly by their two star players , @entity0 and @entity181			1
contrast their approach with that of @entity184 , who said on sunday he was more pumped - up for the singles than he had been for the final round of his two major wins this year			0
emerging players such as @entity146 and @entity147 actually get it but the @entity25 must pick the right captain and the @entity8 has to react to @entity0 ’s mutiny			1
start there and they will be on the right road to hosannas at @entity195 in 2016 .			0

the @entity25 lost heavily despite having the *higher* *ranked* players
@entity0 was dropped by @entity13 on saturday
@entity0 said @entity13 should have been more like the last @entity24 winning captain @entity88
@entity25 have lost three @entity1 in a *row* and last won away in 1993
*rookies* @entity147 , @entity146 and @entity205 offer some hope
