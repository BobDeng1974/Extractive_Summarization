the blue light emitted by phones , tablets and energy efficient lightbulbs are known to disrupt sleep , but @entity7 engineers claim to have developed a solution			1
named @entity9 , the led reduces the amount of blue light that is traditionally emitted from a modern bulb , and also fades to darkness gradually to mimic sunset and even moonlight			1
by changing light levels slowly , the company claims the $ 29 ( £ 17 ) bulb promotes relaxation and increases levels of the sleep hormone melatonin			1
the @entity9 costs $ 29 ( £ 17 ) and reduces the amount of blue light emitted compared to phone screens and other energy efficient bulbs			1
in midnight and @entity28 mode , the light gradually fades over the course of 37 minutes , pictured , to mimic a sunset and help people get to sleep naturally research shows that almost six in ten people are not getting enough sleep - a 50 per cent increase on just a year ago			1
experts blame the rise on growing numbers of us using smartphones , tablet computers and other gadgets in bed and in the hour or two before turning in			0
the blue light emitted by the screens reduces drowsiness and so makes it harder to fall asleep			1
psychologist professor @entity47 said : ‘ the blue light from these devices suppresses the production of the sleep - inducing hormone melatonin and so it ’s important to avoid them before bedtime			1
’ according to the firm ’s website : ‘ falling asleep is highly dependent on behaviour			0
‘ our bodies do n’t adjust well to abrupt changes			0
having an easy transition from waking to sleeping helps prepare you for sleep			0
’ the @entity9 was designed to fade over 37 minutes , which is the average duration of a sunset			2
it comes with three modes , all controlled via a light switch on the wall			0
in @entity73 mode , the switch is used in the same way as a standard light			0
to activate midnight mode , users flick the switch twice			1
the bulb then blinks to confirm the setting has been activated before fading to dark gradually			1
the @entity9 comes with three modes			0
in @entity73 mode , the switch is used in the same way as a standard light			0
to activate midnight mode , users flick the switch twice and the bulb fades to dark gradually			1
by flicking the switch three times , the bulb activates @entity28 mode and fades to low light in 37 minutes by flicking the switch three times , the bulb will blink twice to activate @entity28 mode and fade to low light in 37 minutes - ideally used as a night light for children			1
makers @entity97 claim the @entity9 has an average lifespan of 30,000 hour - 30 times longer than incandescent bulbs			2
it also replaces @entity102 incandescent bulbs with @entity104 versions , meaning it saves energy too			0
this will vary depending on where the person lives and how often they use the bulb , but figures state using the bulb eight hours a day in the @entity7 will save an average of $ 11.28 ( £ 6.65 ) per year , per bulb			2
the initial stock of lights has sold out			0
it is available in the @entity7 direct from @entity97 ’s website , or outside the @entity7 via @entity119			0
makers @entity97 claim the @entity9 , pictured , has an average lifespan of 30,000 hours - 30 times longer than incandescent bulbs			2
it also replaces 40w bulbs with @entity104 versions , meaning it saves energy too			0

*studies* claim blue light from smartphone screens can *affect* sleep
the @entity9 costs $ 29 ( £ 17 ) and reduces the amount of blue light emitted
daylight mode works like a regular bulb but with low levels of blue light
in midnight mode the bulb gradually fades to dark to mimic a sunset
to create a night light , the moonlight mode fades the bulb to low light
by fading slowly , the bulb naturally increases melatonin needed for sleep
