healing : mothers have reported powerful properting from eating their placenta			1
pictured : a smoothie there is a tall glass of something very red and rather alarming on the kitchen counter when i meet @entity9 at her three - bedroom home in @entity11			1
more scary still , she appears to be drinking it			2
fortunately it soon becomes clear that my suspicions are unwarranted , as the substance in the tumbler is nothing more troubling than plain old fruit juice			2
but i am here because @entity9 is a national expert in the art of the strange foodstuff , and one very disconcerting product in particular			1
the 41 - year - old mother - of - two is part of a rapidly growing cottage industry that prepares fresh placenta for new mothers			1
along with some 60 other specialists in this country , she whizzes it into smoothies , or grinds it into pills for women convinced of its health benefits			1
mothers have reported powerful healing properties , saying that eating their own placenta ( the blood - filled organ that supports the foetus in the womb ) has helped to increase their milk supply , reduce post-natal bleeding , stabilise blood pressure , and , crucially , provide them with more energy to care for their babies			1
celebrities who have eaten their own placentas include @entity55 actresses @entity53 and @entity56 and @entity58 singer @entity57			2
@entity9 has had no reported cases of food poisoning among her clients			1
nor , for that matter , has any other practitioner in the 70 - strong @entity64 ( @entity64 ) , of which @entity9 is a member			1
@entity64 estimates that between 4,000 and 5,000 women have used the service since it started in 2010 , the majority in @entity68			2
yet @entity9 is in despair , having found herself at the centre of a storm which could not only destroy her own business , but help put an end to placenta - eating across the country			1
they have already taken half her essential kit , including a grinder and a pill - maker , meaning she can no longer provide her service			2
she said : ‘ it does seem like a witch - hunt			0
why should they be doing everything they can to stop me providing a service which i believe helps new mothers ? yes , some people might be squeamish about it , but that does n’t give the council the right to just close me down			2
’ @entity64 director @entity105 lost her court battle against @entity107 in @entity108 last year			0
she believes the legal action is part of a national move to shut down the industry			2
three other @entity64 businesses have also faced opposition from local authorities			0
benefits : mothers say eating placenta has helped to increase their milk supply and reduce post-natal bleeding			1
pictured : placenta capsules it was in march that the council took action against @entity9			1
health bosses claimed that dangerous microbes would multiply while the placenta was being processed in her kitchen – with the risk of poisoning the mother			0
last month , @entity11 failed to convince a magistrate to grant a hygiene emergency prohibition order against @entity9 , who contested the order			1
despite noting her various food - safety certificates , and failing to advise how she might satisfy their health risk concerns , the council is trying again and she will re-appear in court in may			0
@entity9 says of the council ’s inspection : ‘ it was clear they did n’t know how a maternity ward works			1
they had the impression that placentas were just falling out of women all over the floor and being put into buckets with other placentas			2
it ’s just not the case			0
’ @entity9 provides her clients – mostly well - educated , professional women – with a large zip - lock bag into which the placenta is placed			1
the bagged organ is then put into a large leak - proof plastic box , which goes into a cool bag packed with ice packs ready for @entity9 to collect			1
celebrities who have eaten their own placentas include @entity53 star @entity53 ( left ) and @entity58 singer @entity57 ( right ) if the mother has requested a £ 20 placenta smoothie at the birth , @entity9 blends some with fruit and apple juice using a hand - held blender			1
she takes the remainder home and either steams the organ with lemon , ginger and green chilli , or dries slices of placenta in a dehydrator before grinding the pieces into a powder which she makes into capsules			2
this service costs £ 150			0
@entity9 , a former primary school teacher turned birth ‘ doula ’ – a non-medical supporter for expectant mothers – became interested in placenta consumption after watching chef @entity183 flambee one on tv			1
she added placenta processing to her birth doula business in march 2013 after a day - long @entity64 training course			0
she obtained certificates in food safety for manufacturing , infection control , and @entity197 , a food safety management system			0
a @entity83 spokesman said : ‘ preparation of foodstuffs using human placenta in this way can present a number of potentially serious health risks to those who consume them			0
we are legally obliged to investigate and take whatever steps are necessary to protect consumers			0
’ a key genetic mutation could explain why some children who catch flu are left fighting for their lives in hospital – while others just need a day or two in bed			0
scientists discovered the mutation after studying a two - year - old @entity221 girl who nearly died from the flu			0
they found she was particularly vulnerable because she had inherited a rare double genetic mutation from both of her parents which meant she was unable to produce a protein called interferon			0
@entity230 , which is commercially available , helps the immune system attack flu and could now be used to save young victims			0
professor @entity234 - @entity233 , from the @entity235 in @entity236 , and the @entity237 of @entity238 at @entity239 in the @entity240 , said : ‘ this finding suggests that one could treat severe childhood flu with interferon			0
’ the girl , who was critically ill with flu in 2011 , has not had the virus since , after being vaccinated annually			0
the researchers ’ findings have been published in the journal @entity250 .			0
