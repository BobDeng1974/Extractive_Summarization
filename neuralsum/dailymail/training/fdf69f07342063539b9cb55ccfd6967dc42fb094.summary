the @entity11 , which reputedly slows down ageing , is selling so fast at retailers including @entity14 and @entity15 that suppliers have had to increase stock twenty-fold to keep up with demand			2
and its unique selling point is that it tastes nothing like broccoli and is in fact sweet , a trick @entity24 mother @entity23 came up with when she invented the drink in the 1980s in order to encourage her children to eat their green vegetables			1
the life - giving broccoli drink that hails from @entity32 country @entity31 @entity33 , left , have become a surprise hit in middle - class @entity10 supermarkets because parents are delighted at finding a new way to encourage their fussy children to eat broccoli and other vegetables , right the project began when @entity23 was diagnosed with an iron deficiency during pregnancy 27 years ago in @entity31			1
her doctor advised her to drink a blend of spinach and apple juice , so @entity23 set about juicing a mixture of vegetables and fruits			2
she loved the taste so much she has been developing and juicing her recipes ever since , convincing her children to love vegetables via her delicious drinks			0
in 2011 , @entity23 and her son @entity56 - who was curious as to why he could never find smoothies as good as his mother 's - decided to bring the secret recipe into the mainstream @entity56 took the old family recipe and developed a cold - pressure machine to crush the vegetables using 90,000lbs per square inch , the equivalent of being crushed by a herd of elephants			0

in blind taste - test carried out before the product 's launch , 98 per cent of those asked to guess what they were tasting could not detect broccoli			2
that has helped make it popular with parents trying to find new ways to encourage their children to eat more leafy green vegetables when they often can not stand the taste			0
unlike many other smoothies , the @entity11 ingredients do not need to be heated and pasteurised in production - a common process which prevents decay but sees fruit and veg lose much of their nutritional value			0
