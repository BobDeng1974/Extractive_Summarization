by @entity1 reporter last updated at 12:35 pm on 29th november 2011 it may be 65 years old but classic @entity3 has beaten all its modern rivals to be nominated @entity7 's favourite @entity6 film			1
the 1946 movie , which stars @entity9 as @entity10 a man who plans to kill himself on christmas eve until a guardian angel intervenes , picked up almost a fifth of the 3,000 votes cast			0
the online poll , carried out by @entity15 , longlisted 50 films set on or around @entity6 and asked people to pick their favourite			0
golden oldie : it 's a wonderful life from 1947 starring @entity9 and @entity21 has been voted @entity7 's favourite @entity6 film the second most popular was @entity23 which picked up 10 per cent of votes , followed by the @entity26 film @entity27			1
a slightly less obvious choice was @entity28 which took eighth place			2
the film , which stars @entity32 as off - duty cop @entity33 battling a building full of criminals on @entity36 , took 4 per cent of the vote			0
@entity39 master : @entity40 with co-stars in 1992 's @entity23 which was voted second favourite romantic : love actually starring @entity43 came in at number three @entity45 film editor @entity44 said : ' as it is the season to be jolly , i wo n't disguise my rosy - cheeked joy that the poll named @entity28 one of the top 10 @entity6 movies of all time			1
' @entity28 may come up short in terms of snowfall , but it earns its place			2
a high - octane , 18 - certificate hostage thriller whose publicity features a perspiring man in a white vest , it was not exactly marketed as a festive family treat , and in any case , arrived in cinemas in july 1988 in @entity66 and february 1989 here			0
@entity67 's finest : elf starring @entity69 and @entity70 with @entity71 came in fourth and fifth respectively ' but , set on @entity36 , it 's just as capable of producing festive tingles as the more traditional , december released @entity23 or the cocklewarming @entity27 , which was literally giftwrapped in 2003 with a lovely red ribbon tied around its twinkling poster image			1
' meanwhile , i 'm dreaming of a white - vested @entity6 , specifically @entity79 's master thief in @entity28 , @entity80 , deadpanning the phrase ' @entity82			0

the @entity23 was voted into second place
@entity26 's @entity27 was third
