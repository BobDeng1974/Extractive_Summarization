by @entity1 reporter published : 04:54 est , 23 january 2014 updated : 09:20 est , 23 january 2014 links : the four horses are believed to have some link to legendary gambler and former trainer @entity7 bookmakers were estimated to have lost millions in just a few hours yesterday after four heavily - backed horses won at races across the country			1
one bookie has estimated the losses could be as high as £ 15million , but other industry estimates have suggested about £ 2million could have been lost			1
each of the horses were believed to have some link to legendary gambler and former trainer @entity7			1
bookmakers had been on red - alert from early morning after latching on to the well - backed quartet , all of which were returning from lengthy absences and struck at @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27			1
a @entity29 spokesman told @entity30 the @entity32 bookmaker believed the industry could have lost £ 15m			1
but @entity34 , of @entity35 , said : ' it was a bad day at the office , nothing more and nothing less			2
' we dodged most of the early morning frenzy but you ca n’t stop moving trains and we got caught up in some of it as the day panned out			2
' suggestions of a multi-million pound bloodbath are probably wide of the mark so we ’re not going to lunge for the violins just yet			2
' our decision not to price the @entity27 races up until as late as possible helped protect us from the worst of it and we certainly were n’t exposed to any of the overnight business where most of the fancy prices were snapped up			1
' we are satisfied that the systems we have in place at our end are sufficient to protect us as best we can from circumstances like today			2
' ultimately we have a responsibility to keep on top of the rumours and trade accordingly , which we managed to do			2
' well backed : @entity61 - ridden by @entity62 - wins over the jumps at @entity26 on wednesday @entity65 ’s @entity64 said : ' although we avoided laying some of the larger prices overnight , we did see a number of multiple bets featuring these four horses both online and in shops , and throughout the day this number increased as word of the gamble that was taking place gathered momentum			1
' victory for all four horses has cost us a six - figure payout , and based on our losses we would estimate the industry has been hit for something in the region of £ 2million , which although still costly , is perhaps lower than some claims			1
' @entity84 for @entity85 said : ' we had one punter who took £ 100k out of us before we slashed the odds			1
so it was a bad day , but not horrific by any stretch			2
' @entity90 priced up the races early , and any punter who got on with a £ 1 accumulator bet at the reported prices relating to the four particular horses linked to @entity7 could have expected to pick up around £ 13,000 , although not all firms marked up the races in the morning or overnight			1
@entity7 could not be contacted by @entity98			1
the first horse to win was @entity100 at @entity25 , who went off at @entity103 favourite having been at 20 - 1 the previous evening			1
strong runner : @entity105 , ridden by @entity106 , wins the @entity107 at @entity27 he had not run for 481 days and had not beaten a horse on his last four runs			2
he was previously trained by @entity7 but is now in the care of @entity112 , who trains at a @entity7 - owned stable in @entity113			1
mr @entity112 , who denied any knowledge of the bets placed on @entity116 , said : ' we have had him seven months and have had problems with him but he is a genuine horse			0
' ' suggestions of a multi-million pound bloodbath are probably wide of the mark so we ’re not going to lunge for the violins just yet ' - @entity34 , of @entity35 the @entity25 stewards held an inquiry into the apparent improvement in form of @entity100			0
officials heard from mr @entity112 , who stated that the horse had been in his care for seven months having previously been trained by @entity7 and its absence from the track was due to back problems and a near fore tendon injury			1
having heard his evidence , and received comments from the handicapper , the explanation was noted and @entity100 was ordered to be routine tested			0
like @entity100 , the @entity141 - trained @entity140 was a former @entity7 inmate and won its race at @entity26			1
the 9 - 4 favourite , which had been off the track since finishing third in a novice event at @entity148 in june , won by a length and a half under jockey @entity151			0
ms @entity141 ’s husband , @entity152 , told @entity153 : ' he ’s bandaged in exercise and when he ’s in his stables and we just have to mind him very carefully , that ’s why he ’s got so few miles on the clock			0
' i did n’t ( have any money on )			0
someone just said that ( there had been a gamble )			0
he was 7 - 2 , 4 - 1 in the paper anyway and @entity166 ’s was very well fancied and that was a non-runner , so i ’m not sure about that			0
' mr @entity112 also trained the third leg of the accumulator , @entity171 , who was sent off at 4 - 6 favourite on his first run for 700 days			0
he had also been available at 20 - 1 the night before the race			0
mr @entity112 said : ' he only just scrapped into this race with his mark of 45 and i ran him here last year and he pulled way too hard			0
he has always shown ability but we were lucky the second just turned it in			0
' he was also interviewed by the @entity27 stewards , stating that @entity171 had been trained on his own following a year ’s break , as he was known to be a hard puller in his previous races , and was better suited by being dropped back to six furlongs			2
the explanation was noted and the gelding ordered to be routine tested			0
the gamble was completed by @entity188 - trained @entity105 at @entity27 who was returned the 7 - 4 on favourite on his first start since finishing seventh of seven over two miles at @entity193 last february			0
quizzed by the stewards , mr @entity188 stated that @entity105 had been gelded since its last run and had benefited from the drop in class			0
his evidence was noted and the horse routine tested			0
@entity201 said it saw trickles of money for some of the runners on tuesday night , coupled with new accounts opening and various permutations attempted across the group of runners , but estimated only a £ 200,000 group - wide pay - out			1
@entity213 spokesman @entity212 said : ' we were aware of , and have been monitoring , the situation today			0
in the cases of those horses who have shown an improvement in form an inquiry was held by the stipendiary stewards and all horses were routine tested			2
' it is @entity213 policy not to comment on specific investigations or speculation surrounding potential investigations , however an investigation would only occur if there is any evidence of @entity232 being breached			0
' @entity100 20 - 1 evens £ 200 @entity140 7 - 1 9 - 4 £ 70 @entity171 20 - 1 4 - 6 £ 200 @entity105 7 - 1 7 - 4 £ 70 meanwhile , a £ 1 accumulator bet with @entity90 , who priced up the races early , at the reported prices could have expected to pick up around £ 13,000 .			1
