the grace of @entity1 , the power of @entity3 , the pained determination of @entity5 — all broadcast free to @entity8 ’s legion of armchair fans			1
in an ideal world the @entity10 would like it to stay that way , which is why they moved quickly on tuesday to scotch suggestions that any move towards subscription channels was imminent			0
responding to a report that there had been talks between the @entity22 and @entity23 about possibly sharing coverage , a @entity8 spokesman said that they were committed to their near 80 - year broadcasting partner			1
tv presenter @entity28 hosts the @entity22 's coverage at the @entity30 recently the @entity22 has had to cut or share its broadcasting rights for many live sporting events			2
lost shared the ‘ crown jewel ’ events that must be shown on free - to - air tv : @entity37 ; football @entity38 and @entity40 ; @entity41 final ; @entity43 final ; the @entity45 ; the @entity46 ; @entity8 finals ; @entity48 final ; @entity51 final			1
‘ there has definitely not been contact with @entity23 , ’ he said			2
the @entity22 never comment on rights negotiations and , in any event , their deal to cover @entity59 ’s @entity58 event runs for another three years			2
the good news for the millions who look forward to watching the summer fortnight of tennis without having to pay anything beyond the licence fee is that no drastic change will happen in the short - to - medium term			0
however , the media landscape is being reshaped so rapidly , and such are the questions hanging over the future budgets available to the public service broadcaster , that the status quo may not last forever			1
the @entity22 has been around at @entity8 almost as long as the @entity74 , having started in 1937 with brief flashes of coverage growing to the enormous and slick operation that now hits the screens for two weeks every year			1
ties between the two institutions run deep and , ever pragmatic , the @entity10 , which hosts @entity8 , continues to recognise the power of terrestrial television			2
@entity84 ’s triumph over @entity85 in the @entity86 , for example , was arguably partly down to the driver ’s feats being screened for free far more often than those of the golfer			0
but however much @entity8 ’s fondness for the @entity22 is reciprocated , the corporation is living in more straitened times , and with budgets limited there may come the time when the appeal of sharing costs with a wealthy partner proves irresistible			1
@entity5 with the @entity8 trophy after winning the @entity30 in july 2013 a @entity22 cameraman records the tennis action on @entity74 at the @entity10 in 1999 such arrangements are already in place with @entity106 over @entity108 coverage , and something similar exists when it comes to the @entity41			1
of course the nature of a short @entity58 is different , and in tennis specific terms it is more instructive to look at the new deal that began this year for coverage in @entity117 of the @entity118			0
@entity118 is covered in its first week exclusively from 11am to 3pm by @entity119			0
then @entity120 , the equivalent of the @entity22 , joins in , so if you want to watch the day ’s play in full you have to sign up to a package that includes its broadcast partner			0
in time it is conceivable that this could happen at @entity8			0
the decision on who broadcasts @entity8 is @entity8 ’s , although the finals weekend is considered one of the nation ’s sporting ‘ crown jewels ’ that must be shown free to air			1
the @entity22 television edit suite showing all the courts during the @entity138 and 90 per cent of tournament profits go to the @entity140 for the growth of the sport , so there are no shareholders baying for absolute profit			2
the @entity10 need to make substantial amounts to pay for its latest phase of development , although this will be covered by the event ’s remarkable commercial success			0
among the contributory factors to that is the 12 - year - deal with @entity156 broadcasters @entity155 that started in 2012 , reputedly worth £ 300million			0
it is notable that when the decision to drop co-hosts @entity161 was announced , all @entity159 chairman @entity158 stated that a major attraction was having one broadcaster covering the whole thing			0
yet with the world changing so fast , nothing can guarantee there will not end up being a third party in this longest of marriages between @entity8 and the @entity22 .			1

@entity8 said on tuesday that there had been no contact with @entity23
but the long - term future is *uncertain* with questions hanging over future budgets at the @entity22
only the finals weekend must be shown on free - to - air television
