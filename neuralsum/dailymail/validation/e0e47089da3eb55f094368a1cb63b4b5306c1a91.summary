@entity0 may like his martini shaken , not stirred , but the fictional spy has n't had to contend with zero gravity when sipping his favourite tipple			0
making cocktails in space is a difficult business , but now there ’s a specially designed ‘ glass ’ in the pipeline that promises to force liquid to stay put			1
grooves in the 3d printed vessel will let astronauts enjoy the aroma of a beverage and keep the fluid in place so they can drink in a way they are used to on @entity21			1
@entity38 once developed ‘ parabolic sherry ’ and astronauts have been known to have a swig of vodka , but drinking from a conventional glass is difficult			1
this is because liquid becomes sticky and clumps together in blobs in zero gravity			2
if a glob of water is broken , for example , it splits into many smaller blobs that scatter everywhere and are hard to clean up			0
to solve this problem , liquid is typically kept in bags with attachment for straws , but while this is practical , it ’s not an elegant solution and means astronauts ca n’t smell the liquid , which is naturally less pungent and tasteless in zero gravity			1
the start - up chose to @entity63 print the cup so the complicated design can be refined quickly – with each design taking around 15 hours to print			1
because there is already a printer on the @entity70 , the idea is that glasses could be printed off straight away , without the need to transport the delicate vessels			1
image shows early versions in the 1979 film , @entity76 , @entity0 , played by @entity77 ( a poster is shown ) , has a space adventure but does n't attempt to drink his signature martini in space the first step is drop the glass inside a 102ft - tall lift at @entity86 , to produce two seconds of weightlessness , so that the durability of the glass and how different fluids react , can be tested			2
experts will use a high speed camera to look at what is happening and refine the design			0
researchers will then conduct live tests with humans on a parabolic aircraft or ‘ vomit comet ’			0
one unofficial test has already taken place			0
the ultimate goal is to @entity63 print a ‘ glass ’ on the @entity70 ‘ the @entity105 is a fluid dynamics and lifestyle experience design experiment , ’ the company said			1
‘ we are creating an open air drinking container that allows you to enjoy the aroma of the drink , yet keep the fluids under control			0
‘ your mouth completes the connection like a straw and you can suck the drink into your mouth			0
’ the ‘ glass , ’ which is said to ‘ combine the beauty of a classic martini glass with the physics of space science ’ has grooves that force liquid to flow towards the drinker ’s mouth , in one direction			1

‘ the @entity105 is a fluid dynamics and lifestyle experience design experiment , ’ the company said			2
it hopes that products including the glass could be used by astronauts as well as future space tourists and colonists in the future researchers at the @entity150 and @entity151 at @entity86 recently unveiled a zero gravity espresso cup , which has a series of channels to simulate pouring			1
' its geometry is the ' smart ' part , which provides the fluids - control system without requiring pumps or centrifugal forces , ' said @entity161 , who developed the system			0
' the shape of the container can passively drive fluids to desired locations without moving parts — exploiting the passive forces of wetting and surface tension			0
' researchers at the @entity150 and @entity151 at @entity86 recently unveiled a zero gravity espresso cup ( pictured ) , which has a series of channels to simulate pouring the new design makes possible the enjoyment of espresso and other drinks in the low - gravity environments of spacecraft			2
without the pull of gravity , fluids behave very differently than on @entity21			0
instead of ' pouring , ' a liquid retains a more globular shape held together by its own surface tension			0
this phenomenon complicates even the most basic of maneuvers such as drinking a cup of coffee			2
drinks have typically bee consumed in plastic pouches in space			0
this image shows a pouch of coffee attached to the @entity70 ' new espresso machine the 3d - printed espresso cup is designed to cheat low - gravity by channeling liquid along a specifically - calculated contour in the vessel to exploit capillary forces that simulate the action of pouring			1
experiments related to the development of the zero - gravity cups have been officially dubbed the @entity208 by @entity38			0
related tests to be performed onboard @entity70 this year include simple drinks such as clear juices , to complex drinks such as cocoa and peach mango smoothies			2
last year one @entity217 astronaut took an @entity219 machine with her to perk up the crew			0
it ’s one of several projects planned by the group who envisage its lifestyle products could be used by astronauts as well as future space tourists and colonists			1
‘ we are hoping to inspire the idea of a future when space hotels are in orbit and settlements are on other planets that people can relax and enjoy the experience of a quality drink , no matter what the gravity , ’ the company said			2
it has created a @entity243 campaign to continue developing the cup and raise $ 30,000 ( £ 20,000 ) to eventually print it on the @entity70 ‘ this campaign will help us test the glass in real weightless environments , which is very difficult to simulate on @entity21 , ’ @entity32 said			1
there have been many attempts to create cups capable of drinking liquids normally in space			0
here , astronaut @entity253 uses a hose to blast droplets of water into his mouth the ' glass ' can be pre-ordered from the crowd funding website for $ 400 ( £ 263 ) and $ 500 ( £ 329 ) for a colourful version , and is due to ship in february next year			1
earlier this year , researchers revealed a @entity63 printed design that will let astronauts sip coffee from a strangely - shaped cup			1
it too uses a series of channels to simulate the pouring needed to create the perfect drink			0
while a martini glass may be useful , arguably champagne and carbonated drinks remain the final frontier in space drinks because bubbles are n't buoyant in zero gravity conditions as they are on @entity21 and so behave in a strange way			2
they remain randomly distributed throughout a fluid – even after someone has swallowed them and small bubbles can join up to make large ones , resulting in digestion problems .			0

@entity105 in @entity24 is developing the ' glass '
it has carefully positioned grooves to keep liquid in the drinking vessel
ridges act to guide liquid towards a drinker **'s** mouth in zero gravity
@entity63 printed cup can be pre-ordered on @entity243 from $ 400 ( £ 263 )
it **'s** intended for astronauts and one *day* , space tourists and colonists
@entity307 aim it to @entity63 print a version on the @entity70
