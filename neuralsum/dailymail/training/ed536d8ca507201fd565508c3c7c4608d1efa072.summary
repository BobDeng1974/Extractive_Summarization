@entity0 vs @entity1 sunday , 11.30pm gmt @entity2 , @entity3 the eccentric @entity1 defend their @entity5 title against @entity0 in @entity3 , @entity6 looking to become the fist team to win back - to - back title since the @entity0 in 2004			1
in his record sixth appearance in the @entity12 ’s seasonal showpiece , will @entity9 join the likes of @entity14 and @entity15 in winning four rings , or will @entity17 make it back - to - back victories ? here is our ultimate a to z list ahead of this sunday 's blockbuster in @entity6			1
@entity6 hosts its third @entity5 on sunday			1
the @entity0 have unfinished business in the @entity6 after being denied a perfect season by @entity28 ’s unfancied @entity27 ( and @entity30 ’s infamous helmet catch ) seven years ago			1
in other news , the @entity31 won their third title in four years with a 27 - 17 victory over the @entity35 in @entity36 in 1996			0
the state of @entity6 will be hosting the @entity5 for the third time in it 's history this weekend the helmets of the @entity0 and @entity1 laid out in the @entity6 desert @entity42 @entity42 may not talk to the media , but his rumblings on the field are as loud as anything in the @entity12			1
the heart of this @entity17 team , the bruising , angry 157 yards he accrued against @entity50 in the nfc championship game propelled the @entity1 into consecutive @entity5			1
he ’s nigh - on impossible to stop , but if the @entity0 can contain him , that will go a long way to deciding the destination of the @entity55			2
@entity42 has stole the show this week in press conferences , despite saying very little commercials cost an eye - watering $ 4.5million for a 30 - second slot ; a $ 500,000 increase on last year			1
as a consequence , @entity62 has struggled to sell and after last year ’s blowout the breaks during the first quarter are the most desirable			0
here is @entity68 and @entity69 's @entity5 1992 famous commercial ... deflate-gate @entity72 linebacker @entity71 intercepted a @entity9 pass & thought something was amiss during the @entity0 ’ rout of @entity76 a fortnight ago			1
as a consequence , the @entity12 is currently investigating the @entity0 for using under - inflated footballs in the first half of the afc championship game			1
depending on where you stand on @entity84 ’s regime , they ’re either win - at - all - costs cheats or unfortunate victims of an @entity12 sting			0
the investigation concludes after the @entity5 , with a fine and lost draft picks dished out if found guilty			2
@entity0 's victory over the @entity72 is under investigation for the use of deflated balls @entity94 , @entity95 a quarterback at college , the @entity0 wide receiver and punt returner has also turned his hand to video editing			2
@entity0 wide receiver @entity94 during team practice in @entity6 this week first downs will be key			1
@entity0 already has 57 this postseason in only two games			2
the @entity1 have more than 20 fewer at 36			0
for more stats , click here @entity107 , @entity108 finally healthy for a @entity5 , @entity0 fans have to hope he ’ll leave the kittens at home and give the @entity1 a ' @entity113 to remember ’			1
he ’s redefined the tight end position and is arguably the best of all - time , such is the impact made during his five - year career			1
he could be set for a monster afternoon as 11 of the 17 touchdowns @entity17 conceded through the air this season were scored by tight ends			0
his alma mater is the @entity126 , so expect antics galore if the @entity0 win			0
@entity107 has been fitter and healthier this season than he has for a long time for the @entity0 hoody , the ahead of an unprecedented sixth @entity5 trip , regardless of the result , @entity84 ’s reputation as one of the @entity12 ’s best ever coaches is unquestioned			1
but there ’s a huge difference between 3 - 3 and 4 - 2 in @entity5 , and the gnarled , stony - faced warrior will be desperate to win			2
@entity0 head coach @entity84 addresses the media this week in @entity139 , @entity6 @entity140 , @entity141 nobody has defended more passes since 2007 , so it is little wonder that the @entity0 plucked shutdown corner @entity141 from free agency			1
is he better than @entity148 ? seahawks receiver @entity150 is n’t convinced , saying : ‘ i 'm going to bring my sunblock , my shades , and a hat and i 'm going to go to @entity141 and see what i can do			0
and i 'll let you know after the game			0
’ @entity0 cornerback @entity141 addresses the media in the lead up to the @entity5 @entity159 a strangely unheralded piece of the @entity0 ’ strangely underrated linebacking corps			2
the second - year @entity163 graduate is a versatile chess piece whom @entity62 analyst @entity165 said can be as good as any player in the league			0
from lining up inside , blitzing , rushing the pass from outside and inside , he can do it all			0
@entity171 performing the half - time show at the @entity5 with the eyes of the world watching is one of the biggest moments of any musician 's career			1
over the years the likes of @entity180 , @entity181 and the @entity182 have graced the stage , but this weekend the honour will fall to @entity171			0
the 30 - year - old @entity187 superstar will headline the half - time show at this year 's @entity5			1
since bursting onto the scene with hit single @entity189 in 2008 , @entity188 has had nine no 1 singles in the @entity193 as well as two no 1 albums			0
she promised that there will be nothing deflated about her performance on sunday			0
@entity171 will headline the half - time show this weekend at the @entity2 @entity181 gave a lights - out performance in the @entity201 during the @entity202 legion of boom despite losing @entity204 , one of its founder members , to the @entity0 in free agency , @entity17 ’s secondary is as fearsome as they come			1
the little and large safety pairing of @entity209 and @entity210 are almost without fault , while @entity212 has slotted in perfectly opposite @entity148 , the self - confessed ‘ best corner in the game ’			0
meanwhile , nickel corner @entity215 showed his credentials by scoffing at @entity107			0
’ i do n’t think he ’s that good , actually , ’ he uttered			0
@entity148 , one part of the mighty ' @entity203 ' in practice this week in @entity36 , @entity6 @entity221 a little - known linebacker called @entity223 won the accolade - and a @entity226 pick - up truck - a year ago			2
@entity9 is a two - time winner in 2002 and 2004 and has a chance to match @entity15 in winning his third this @entity229 crown this weekend			2
@entity9 has a chance to win his third @entity229 title this weekend in @entity3 the @entity0 have been practicing all week in @entity36 ahead of sunday 's showpiece @entity233 , @entity108 a reincarnation of @entity237 , the @entity0 ’ linebacker / defensive end / playmaker always seems to be near the ball when it counts			1
overtime no @entity5 has ever gone into a fifth quarter			0
those in the know are predicting the tightest of encounters , so could that be about to change ? @entity245 went 27 - 21 in his three - year stint in @entity0 , but in 2010 , @entity17 chose to take a punt on the enthusiastic coach after nine years at @entity249			2
last year , he became the third coach to win a college national championship and a @entity5			2
victory in @entity255 will see him becoming the seventh coach to win consecutive @entity5 , joining an elite club of @entity258 , @entity259 , @entity260 , @entity261 , @entity262 and , of course , @entity84			0
@entity1 head coach @entity245 talks to @entity264 during team practice @entity266 , @entity267 hailed as a defensive genius and a player ’s coach , @entity17 ’s @entity268 is off to replace @entity272 as the @entity273 ’ next head coach			0
@entity1 defensive coordinator @entity266 is interviewed on media day in @entity255 referee eight years after suffering an aortic dissection and being told he would never again officiate an @entity12 game , @entity279 is the man in the white cap on sunday			2
and the @entity1 are 5 - 0 in games officiated by the accountant			2
@entity283 referee @entity279 at a press conference in the build - up to the game @entity148 , @entity148 he ’s brash , loud and a mathematics graduate from @entity288			1
he also injured his elbow in the nfc championship game and expect @entity9 to work him over early			0
tickets got $ 5,700 spare ? come along … @entity2 with a retractable roof and a field which moves in and out of the stadium on 500 steel wheels , it is an architectural specimen and one of the loudest stadiums in the @entity12			0
the @entity2 has the finishing touches applied ahead of the game on sunday @entity302 with the 21st pick of the @entity304 , the @entity0 chose a franchise legend			1
alongside @entity9 , @entity302 is the only survivor from the @entity307 - winning side and could call it curtains if he claims his second ring			0
@entity302 is one of only two members of the @entity0 remaining from their 2004 @entity5 - winning team @entity264 , @entity264 like @entity9 , @entity264 was underrated in the draft and eventually went to @entity17 in the third round			1
the parallels do n’t stop there : both reached two @entity5 in their first three @entity12 seasons , with @entity9 ’s @entity0 going 40 - 12 , while @entity264 's are 42 - 13			1
@entity264 ’s 82 touchdowns and 31 interceptions beat @entity9 ’s 75 and 41 , with the @entity17 man throwing for 11,591 yards , putting @entity9 ’s 11,523 in the shade			0
quarterback @entity264 and his @entity1 team - mates practice in @entity36 , @entity6 @entity283 the 49th instalment of the @entity5 promises to be a classic			1
but we said that last year			0
you still mad , bro ? the last time the @entity1 and @entity0 met , @entity17 announced themselves as a force in the @entity12 with a 24 - 23 victory			1
@entity148 made a beeline for @entity9 after the game and later tweeted his adversary to further rub salt in the wound			0
the @entity1 beat the @entity0 24 - 23 when the teams last met in october 2012 @entity336 , @entity337 played at quarterback for the @entity0 under @entity245 but he has also enjoyed some memorable moments as the team ’s colour commentator			1
perhaps none more so than this from 2013 .			0

@entity0 take on @entity1 in @entity5
@entity5 takes place on sunday in @entity3 , @entity6
the game is one of the most - watched *sporting* events of the year
