by @entity0 published : 10:12 est , 16 december 2013 updated : 10:24 est , 16 december 2013 an art college has refused to take down a ' disgusting ' painting showing @entity3 dressed as a knight in shining armour			1
the image , painted by a former student , is hung prominently in @entity8 where it can be seen by the college 's students			1
but despite complaints from a member of staff , and concerns expressed by pupils , the college defended exhibiting the image and said it is ' ironic '			1
savile the knight : the painting shows @entity3 , thought to be @entity20 's worst ever peadophile , dressed in shining armour the image , which shows @entity3 standing in front of the @entity25 's @entity24 , with his trademark cigar hanging out of his mouth , is hung up in an exhibition space at a campus in @entity30 , @entity31			1
the viewing space , known as the @entity34 gallery , is open to members of the public as well as students at the college			2
students at the college today said that the work has ' split opinion ' in the college , while an art lecturer has claimed the piece is ironic , and said a caption will be added to ' explain the thinking behind it '			1
tutors at the school refused to remove the painting after a cleaner complained when the painting made it on to the walls			1
@entity54 , 24 , first saw the image in storage last week at the college 's Â£ 3million @entity59 facility , and spoke out when it was put on display			1
prominent : she said : ' i first saw it when i was cleaning an art room and it was stacked in a corner			2
' i was offended but i did n't say anything because it was in a closed - off area , but after they moved it to a public area i felt i had to say @entity71 was disgusted when i saw it up there			0
' the head of art wo n't say who did it because they are a student			1
he wo n't take it down and says it is a piece of art and people will interpret it in different ways			2
' i worry what affect it could have if a young person who 's being abused themselves saw it			0
they have n't portrayed @entity3 as a nasty paedophile but as a kind of hero wearing a suit of armour			0
' he is not a hero or icon - he 's a serial abuser of children and to show him as anything else is wrong			0
' today students at the college said that the painting ' split opinion ' and should be taken down			2
notorious : since @entity3 died in 2011 , dozens of victims have come forward to say he abused them one , who did not wish to be named , said : ' it does split opinion in the college			0
some people think it 's distasteful but some think it 's interesting			0
it causes a debate and i guess that 's the point of art in many ways			0
' another said : ' i think they probably should take it down now everything has come out about him			0
it 's in the corridor not even in a room so you ca n't avoid it if you go to the art department			0
' they say @entity3 had hundreds of victims so it 's possible a family member of someone affected by him will come to this college			0
i do n't think they would want to see a giant portrait of him grinning like that			0
' however , the college defended its decision to display the painting by saying that it is intended to be ironic			1
it released a statement saying : ' the artwork in question is intended to be an ironic comment on organisations that ignore or cover up important issues , going some way to explain why @entity3 's abuse continued undetected for so many years			1
' it has received a number of positive comments on this basis and one expression of concern , from a member of @entity8 's non-teaching staff			2
controversial : the exterior of @entity8 's campus in @entity30 , where the portrait is on display ' the person in question has now had the opportunity to discuss the artwork and the college has assured her that the well - being and safeguarding of its learners are at the very heart of its activities , indeed this is one of the concepts behind the painting			1
" mr @entity177 , an art lecturer at the college , added : ' the purpose of exploring these issues is in enabling discussions to take place rather than allowing them to be swept under the carpet			2
' as an additional safeguard we are creating a caption for the piece which will explain the thinking behind it			1
' @entity31 college , which was given a ' good ' rating in its last @entity193 inspection , has around 6,000 students across its four campuses and caters for leaners as young as 14			0
the gallery - named the @entity198 - is said to exhibit the work of ' professional artists and emerging designers			0

@entity8 has displayed the portrait , by a former student
the former @entity25 presenter stands in armour in front of @entity24
@entity54 , 24 , a cleaner at the school , complained to the head of art
but the college said that the painting is ' an ironic comment ' and will stay
they instead plan to add a caption ' to explain the thinking behind it '
