@entity20 has demanded an inquiry to ' get the full truth out ' about the ' horrific ' allegations that police tried to sully the family of @entity4			1
denial : former met commissioner sir @entity8 's time at @entity9 was dominated by the murder of @entity4 , and he said today he never ' authorised or condoned ' a bid to smear @entity4 's family anger : @entity20 with @entity32 , mother of @entity4 , as the prime minister demanded an inquiry by @entity9 into whether police were trying to undermine the family this afternoon the home secretary announced @entity9 had called in the @entity38 ( @entity38 ) to consider whether undercover officers had worked to undermine the @entity40			1
mrs may told @entity42 that the claims would be considered by @entity44 , the inquiry into the undercover operations of the @entity48 - a covert unit set up to combat protests against the @entity50 in 1968 and funded by the @entity51 - in @entity52 in the 1980s and 1990s			1

the home secretary said she would be ' ruthless ' in purging the @entity2 of any misconduct and made clear that prosecutions could follow the conclusion of the inquiries			2
but she resisted calls to hand the investigation into undercover policing over to the @entity38 , telling mps that chairman @entity71 did not believe this would ' enhance the investigation '			2
worried : the prime minister said today that @entity9 must investigate the damaging claims @entity76 , the father of the murdered teenager , said he was ' dismayed ' at the spying disclosures and called for a judge - led inquiry into the latest allegations			1
mr @entity4 , in a statement issued by his solicitors @entity85 , said : ' i am dismayed about the new information that has come to light as a result of the @entity91 investigation			0
i 've always felt that my family was under greater investigation than those guilty of killing my beloved @entity4			0
' it is unthinkable that in the extremely dark days and months after my son 's murder that my family were subject to such scrutiny			0
' i 've worked with the police since @entity4 's death in good faith to bring the perpetrators to justice and help the police learn the lessons set out in the @entity107 report			0
i feel betrayed by this latest news and it has taken away the faith i had started to build in the police			0
' i understand that the home secretary has announced that she will extend the inquiries of @entity61 and @entity44 , i would like to make it clear that i find this completely unsatisfactory			0
' i am convinced that nothing short of a judge - led public inquiry will suffice and i have no confidence that the measures announced today will get to the bottom of this matter			1

in a statement , @entity8 said such actions - and the keeping of them from the @entity159 into the case which found the @entity2 guilty of institutional racism - would be ' clearly wrong '			1
' i am shocked and dismayed by the allegations made by the former undercover police officer @entity12 , ' he said			2
' i am aware how distressing these allegations must be for @entity12 and mrs @entity32 , and i am anxious they should know the truth as soon as possible			2
' throughout the time i was commissioner i was never aware of , nor did i authorise or condone any police officers being tasked to smear @entity12 and mrs @entity32 in the way suggested by @entity12			1
' i am anxious that the truth of these allegations should be established as soon as possible and i will do all in my power to help that process '			2

speaking at 10 @entity197 , mr @entity20 said : ' let 's be clear , these are absolutely dreadful allegations and we can only think of the @entity4 family , who have suffered so much already from the loss of their son			2
family : @entity4 's mother @entity32 and ex-husband @entity76 , @entity4 's father ' to hear that , potentially , the police that were meant to be helping them were actually undermining them - that 's horrific			1
' we have investigations under way			0
the home secretary will be making a statement to the @entity214			0
' we must make sure those investigations get rapidly to the bottom of what 's happened and we get the full truth out			1
' asked whether he was concerned that lower ranking officers may have been acting on their own initiative , after former @entity2 commissioner @entity8 said he was not aware of any order to target the @entity40 , mr @entity20 said : ' this is worrying and that is why two investigations , one of them being led by the chief constable of another police force , are under way			1
' the home secretary has acted swiftly to make sure that these investigations cover all of the potential allegations and we get to the bottom of this as rapidly as possible			0

mp @entity258 said a public inquiry is necessary to probe the police 's use of undercover agents @entity52 mayor @entity263 condemned as ' utterly disgraceful ' the activities described by mr @entity12 , who says he was told to dig up ' dirt ' shortly after the 18 - year - old was killed in a racist attack in april 1993			1
' i think it is utterly disgraceful that the @entity2 were engaged in this kind of activity whether it is surveillance or trying to discredit the campaign to vindicate the memory of @entity4 , ' he said			0
' it is very important that the family of @entity4 get answers to what i think is an absolutely deplorable series of allegations as soon as possible			0
' anger : metropolitan police commissioner sir @entity235 said : ' if these allegations are true , it 's a disgrace ' @entity258 , chairman of the @entity284 , said the time has come to look seriously at a public inquiry into the police 's use of undercover agents			1
the @entity291 mp , addressing mrs may said : ' when the select committee published our report on march 1 into undercover police officers , we expressed deep concern that @entity44 had taken 20 months , cost Â£ 1.2 million , involved 23 officers but nobody had been arrested			0
' chief constable @entity54 is a full - time serving chief constable			0
' frankly with 50,000 documents to look through it 's going to take them years to resolve this matter			0

a @entity2 spokesman said : ' the claims in relation to @entity4 's family will bring particular upset to them and we share their concerns			1
' he added : ' the @entity2 must balance the genuine public interest in these matters with its duty to protect officers and former officers who have been deployed undercover , often in difficult and dangerous circumstances			0
