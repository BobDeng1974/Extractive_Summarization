watchdog ? @entity0 gave his first interview since outing himself famously as the @entity4 leaker			1
in it , he called out the @entity7 media for being complacent toward government power grabs in his first interview since he outed himself as the source of leaked @entity4 documents , @entity0 said the media has given the government a free pass to grow unchecked power ever since the attacks of september 11			1
‘ [ it ] ended up costing the public dearly , ’ the 30 - year - old newly minted @entity18 resident told the @entity20 in a q&a published tuesday			0
@entity0 ’s interview focused on journalists and the media , which he said need to wake up to the realities of surveillance			1
‘ any unencrypted message sent over the @entity31 is being delivered to every intelligence service in the world , ’ he said			1
@entity0 ’s @entity21 was , of course , done through encrypted emails			0
@entity36 , the documentary filmmaker who helped @entity0 spill his secrets , served as intermediary , having won the former @entity4 contractor ’s trust months ago			1
‘ @entity36 was more suspicious of me than i was of her , and i ’m famously paranoid , ’ @entity0 told @entity20 reporter @entity41			1
@entity36 may have reason to be suspicious			0
@entity0 , in describing his methods for choosing a reporter to work with while searching for a way to tell the world what he knew , said that basically all emails are possible targets for government surveillance			1
middle man : @entity36 helped @entity0 leak what he knew			2
she also acted as intermediary between the @entity20 and @entity0 , who claimed nearly all emails from the media wind up in the hands of government agencies those from news organizations , he suggested , are all the more likely to be read			1
' assume that your adversary is capable of a trillion guesses per second , ' he wrote to @entity36 at the start of their work together , a relationship the @entity20 documents alongside the @entity0 interview			0
‘ in the wake of this year ’s disclosures , ’ he said , invoking the information about the @entity4 he himself leaked , ‘ it should be clear that unencrypted journalist - source communication is unforgivably reckless			2
’ but @entity0 , who had his @entity7 passport revoked in june and was recently granted asylum by the @entity18 government after weeks in territorial limbo , simultaneously faulted media outlets for being too permissive about government misdeeds in the post- 9/11			2
' assume that your adversary is capable of a trillion guesses per second ' : while saying media has dropped the ball , @entity0 warns that they , too , are being watched ‘ the most important news outlets in @entity7 abdicated their role as a check to power , ’ @entity0 told the paper of record , ‘ for fear of being seen as unpatriotic and punished in the market during a period of heightened nationalism			2
from a business perspective , this was the obvious strategy , but what benefited the institutions ended up costing the public dearly			0
’ but for all their complacency , @entity0 says , big media organizations are slowly returning to the way they once were			0
‘ the major outlets are still only beginning to recover from this cold period , ’ he said			0
@entity0 ’s own actions , meanwhile , have surely hastened the process .			0

' i *'m* famously paranoid ' : the @entity4 leaker claims every unencrypted email sent by journalists is delivered to the world *'s* intelligence agencies
he said *mainstream* media is only just beginning to question government surveillance *tactics* , a *change* his actions have likely helped speed up
