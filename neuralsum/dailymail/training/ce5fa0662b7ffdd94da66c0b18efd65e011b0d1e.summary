the news comes as the @entity14 recruits foreign doctors in record numbers , many of whom have ‘ little or no knowledge of @entity4 culture ’			1
quotas mean that top students are forced to study medicine abroad – and fund their own education – or choose another degree			2
for 2013 - 2014 , @entity27 universities were allowed to recruit just 6,071 medicine students , even though the @entity29 registers 13,000 doctors each year and the @entity14 struggles to recruit enough staff			1
an estimated 6,000 newly - registered doctors each year are foreigners who trained overseas			1
experts have warned this practice puts lives at risk , because many of these doctors have poor @entity27 and are not always familiar with drugs used in this country			2
despite these concerns , thousands of school - leavers who received their a-level results this month have been turned down for medicine			0
they include @entity2 , 18 , who got straight @entity46 but was rejected by every university she applied to			0
@entity48 , former chairman of the @entity49 , said : ‘ the situation is bonkers			0
the system needs a complete overhaul			0
’ dr @entity54 , a leading @entity55 cancer surgeon , added : ‘ the government needs to take urgent action to help more students study medicine in the @entity4 by increasing the number of places on courses			1
‘ most applicants are rejected despite having the required grades			0
we encourage them to become doctors , then we slap them back for want of places			2
‘ having to go abroad and fund their own studies is a massive disincentive and means many will choose other degrees instead			0
until then , patients remain at risk from foreign doctors who have poor language skills and may not have been trained to our high standards			1
’ medical emergency : despite universities turning away @entity4 medical students , the @entity14 are taking in a record number of foreign doctors dr @entity54 recently attacked the government for limiting the number of ‘ expensive ’ places at @entity4 medical schools in an article for the spectator			1
it costs around £ 250,000 to put a student through medical school			2
with a grades in maths and chemistry and an a * in biology , @entity2 seemed like the ideal medical student			2
but despite her stellar a-level results , the 18 - year - old ’s plans were dashed when she was turned down by four @entity4 universities			1
despite having excellent grades – and work experience at a hospital , an optometrist practice and an overseas blood clinic – she was rejected outright by @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 and @entity111			2
@entity2 , who was head of her house at @entity114 , was also unsuccessful when she tried to find a place through clearing			0
she was , however , offered a place at @entity118 , after coming ninth out of more than 100 applicants in an entrance exam			0
now her parents face the prospect of selling their home , near @entity124 , to fund her studies in @entity126			0
fees for the six - year course will be £ 60,000 – and @entity2 is unable to apply for a student loan , as she will be a foreign student			1
i do n’t know what more i could have done , ’ she said			0
‘ i did n’t expect all those rejections			0
‘ for the next six months my parents are going to see how they can finance my studies			0
‘ i feel bad because if i went to university here they would n’t have to help me			0
’ ‘ i ’m lucky because , although the course is in @entity27 , when you go into a clinical environment you need to speak @entity126 and i am fluent			0
’ her father @entity139 , a chartered surveyor who is married to @entity140 , a chemistry and maths teacher , said : ‘ despite all she has achieved in life , she has been rejected to study in her native country			0
’ those reading medicine in @entity148 pay tuition fees of up to £ 9,000 per year – the same as students of the majority of other subjects			1
however , medicine courses last five or six years , depending on the university			0
students accepted on @entity14 - funded places are able to apply for means - tested bursaries to help fund their course , while all students are eligible for a non-means tested bursary of £ 1,000 in their fifth and sixth years			1
dr @entity54 wrote : ‘ most readers will be surprised to learn that every year , we import 40 per cent of our doctors because of insufficient training places in @entity4 medical schools			1
so , 40 per cent of doctors starting work in the @entity14 every year have little or no knowledge and experience of @entity4 culture or of our health service – and this in the most people - centric occupation of all			1
’ universities ’ medicine courses are vastly oversubscribed – but the @entity181 quotas block them from taking on more undergraduates			2
in one example , the @entity184 had 4,000 applicants for its three medicine and surgery courses this year but just 232 places – enough for just one in 17			2
the @entity191 had 2,500 applicants but could accept only 334 undergraduates			0
the applicants to these two universities alone could have filled the entire country ’s quota for the year			1
a @entity181 spokeswoman said : ‘ we have worked hard to make sure that we have enough places in medical schools to become a self - sufficient @entity171			2
‘ there is a cap on the number of @entity205 students that can attend medical education in @entity148			1
’ a recent @entity29 survey found foreign - trained doctors were four times more likely to be suspended or struck off than those from the @entity4			1
@entity211 , 70 , died in 2009 after @entity213 locum dr @entity214 gave him ten times the normal does of diamorphine			0
