@entity0 still has a chronic shortage of doctors – and experts warn that the situation is putting patients ’ lives at risk			1
despite recruitment drives , the @entity0 has one of the lowest numbers of practising medics per head in the @entity13			2
only @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 have fewer physicians , a study by the @entity15 found			1
shortage : @entity0 has one of the lowest doctor - to - patient ratios in the @entity13 , says a new report ( file photo ) @entity0 has 2.8 doctors per thousand people – less than the @entity13 average of 3.4 and below other major economies including @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32			1
even former communist states such as @entity34 and the @entity35 have a greater proportion and @entity37 has more than twice as many doctors per head than the @entity0			1
experts say the shortage in the @entity42 is most acute among @entity43 and @entity45 doctors			1
last night dr @entity46 , president of the @entity47 , which represents @entity45 doctors , warned the shortage was risking patients			1
‘ when you have shortages of doctors in some areas it means longer waits , ’ he said			0
‘ in @entity45 that ’s not really an option , so it means doctors work harder and harder ; it means there is a greater chance of mistakes , and ultimately it means risks to lives			1
‘ this has been going on the last three or four years – we can not carry on like this			0
’ long wait : @entity45 departments are under strain the report found that the number of doctors in the @entity0 has increased more rapidly than in any other @entity13 country since 2000 , rising by over 50 per cent between 2000 and 2012			1
the rise was set in train by the @entity76 government , but has continued under the @entity77 even since the economic crash			0
‘ as a result , the @entity0 had 2.8 practising physicians per 1000 population in 2012 , up from 2.0 in 2000 , ’ the @entity15 report said			1
‘ this nonetheless remains below the @entity13 average of 3.4 doctors per 1000 population			0
‘ while most of the increase in the number of doctors in the @entity0 in the early 2000s came from the entry of foreign - trained doctors , the situation changed just before the economic crisis with most of the increase now driven by a strong rise in the number of graduates from domestic medical education programmes			2
‘ this reflects a deliberate policy in the @entity0 to reduce its reliance on foreign - trained doctors to meet its own needs			2
’ @entity0 ’s proportion of doctors – 2.8 per 1,000 head of population in 2012 – is much lower , however , than @entity37 on 6.2 , @entity108 on 4.9 and @entity34 on 4.4			1
among our major @entity111 partners , @entity30 ’s rate is 4.0 , @entity31 is on 3.9 , @entity113 is 3.8 and @entity32 is on 3.3			0
the @entity13 average is 3.4 per 1,000 population			0
only four countries are below us – with the lowest being @entity19 on just 2.2			2
the @entity15 said @entity0 ’s rapid rise over the past decade had led to fears that doctors were being trained in the wrong specialisms – meaning they may have to be lain off in future years			1
‘ a growing number of doctors will improve access to health care , but will also put pressure on future health care budgets as more graduates enter the medical workforce , ’ the report said			0
‘ there are now concerns that there might be surpluses of certain categories of doctors in the years ahead			0
this has led to recommendations to reduce slightly student intakes in medical schools or post-graduate training for certain specialties			0
’ dr @entity46 , from the @entity47 , added : ‘ we have been warning for some years that we have got fewer doctors than most parts of the developed world			0
‘ when there are n’t enough doctors to go round , they can pick and choose speciality and because of the levels of burnout in @entity45 , that means many are walking away , creating even greater shortages			2
‘ we have now got 500 @entity45 doctors trained in this country working in @entity158 – that ’s the equivalent of two full years of trained doctors			2
dr @entity161 , chairman of the @entity162 , said : ‘ the @entity42 is under incredible pressure from rising patient demand and flat - lining funding			0
‘ the government ’s announcement of additional resources in the autumn statement for the @entity42 is a step in the right direction , but it will not solve the long term under - doctoring of many parts of the @entity42 that is hindering patient care			0
‘ key specialities such as emergency care and gp services are facing particularly acute shortages			0
