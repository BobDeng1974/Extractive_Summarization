a new list out tuesday reveals that @entity2 ’s wealth is n’t just for the coastal elite by showing just how rich each state ’s most monied top dog really is			1
from @entity7 , where real estate mogul @entity8 reigns supreme to @entity9 , where @entity11 chairman @entity10 looks out onto his outerwear empire , these are the richest in each			0
and while the ten richest , topped again by @entity16 ’s @entity15 and his $ 70.8 billion , have n’t changed since last year , their wealth certainly has			1
scroll down for full list ... @entity16 & @entity2 's richest : @entity15 remains @entity2 's richest person			1
he also hails from the @entity16 , making him the @entity20 's wealthiest individual pricey pad : the @entity24 founder 's compound in @entity25 was built with all the fanciest gadgetry , took 7 years to construct and cost over $ 60 million despite a sluggish economy , these elite among the elite are making even more this year than last			2
together , their combined $ 362 billion makes up 67 percent of the combined wealth of all 50 people on the list compiled by wealth analyst firm wealth - @entity35 the firm was n’t able to pin all of @entity2 ’s billionaires and almost theres to a specific state , so for the ones who ’ve renounced their citizenships like @entity44 ’s @entity43 or only live in their home states in spirit like @entity48 heir @entity47 , they ’ve used the person ’s primary place of business as a guide			1
the worth of the wealthiest 7 percent of households in @entity2 has gone up by around 28 percent since the financial crisis , reports @entity56			0
@entity57 : the @entity58 may not have the most interesting home state , but he 's still the richest man in @entity60 prairie home : @entity58 's @entity60 home is largely unadorned , much like his agricultural home state			1
but , with $ 59.8 billion to his name , @entity64 can certainly afford to vacation elsewhere @entity68 people are everywhere , from the more prosperous states like @entity70 -- home to @entity73 's mayor @entity72 and his $ 21.4 billion -- to the poorer states like @entity75 , where @entity48 heir and bank ceo @entity47 and his $ 31.1 billion calls home			2
@entity16 @entity15 : $ 70.8 billion @entity24 ceo @entity60 @entity58 : $ 59.8 billion @entity81 ceo @entity83 @entity82 : $ 46.4 billion @entity85 ceo @entity87 @entity86 : $ 41.5 billion executive vp @entity88 @entity75 @entity90 : $ 37.1 billion @entity48 heir and @entity93 ceo @entity95 @entity94 : $ 32.2 billion @entity97 ceo @entity70 @entity72 : $ 21.4 billion @entity99 owner @entity101 @entity100 : $ 20.1 billion part - owner @entity102 @entity105 @entity104 : $ 16.9 billion president of @entity107 @entity109 @entity108 : $ 16 billion @entity111 ceo @entity113 @entity112 : $ 14.7 billion @entity115 chairman @entity117 @entity116 : $ 13.7 billion @entity119 founder and chairman @entity122 @entity121 : $ 13.4 billion @entity124 founder @entity126 @entity125 : $ 11.4 billion @entity128 / @entity127 board of directors @entity130 @entity129 : $ 10 billion @entity132 chairman @entity134 @entity133 : $ 9.8 billion @entity136 financial chairman @entity138 @entity137 : $ 9.2b @entity140 chairman @entity142 @entity141 : $ 7.9 billion @entity144 president and founder @entity147 @entity146 : $ 7.4 billion ceo of @entity149 @entity151 @entity150 : $ 7.3 billion @entity153 founder @entity154 @entity43 : $ 6.6 billion @entity44 chairman @entity157 @entity156 : $ 5.9 billion carnival chairman and ceo @entity161 @entity160 : $ 5.6 billion founder of the @entity163 and co-founder of the @entity160 and @entity165 @entity167 @entity166 : $ 5.2 billion chairman and ceo of @entity169 @entity170 : $ 4.8 billion board of directors of medical device firm @entity172 @entity174 @entity173 : $ 4.4 billion founder of @entity176 @entity178 @entity177 : $ 4.1billion founder of real estate firm @entity180 @entity182 @entity181 : $ 3.8 billion founder of @entity184 @entity186 @entity185 : $ 3.8 billion ceo of @entity188 @entity190 @entity189 : $ 3.8 billion owner , @entity192 @entity194 @entity193 : $ 3.2 billion founder of @entity196 , the @entity196 @entity198 @entity197 : $ 2.6 billion chairwoman and ceo of chemical manufacturer @entity201 @entity203 @entity202 : $ 1.9 billion former owner of @entity205 @entity207 @entity206 : $ 1.6 billion founder of @entity209 @entity101 @entity210 : $ 1.6 billion owner of @entity212 @entity214 @entity213 : $ 1.5 billion ceo of @entity216 @entity218 @entity217 : $ 1.5 billion widow construction and energy mogul @entity221 @entity223 @entity222 : $ 1.3 billion owner of @entity225 and @entity226 @entity229 @entity228 @entity227 : $ 1.3 billion owner of @entity231 and board co-chair of @entity233 @entity235 @entity234 : $ 1.2 billion ceo of @entity234 @entity238 @entity237 : $ 1.1 billion founder of @entity240 @entity242 @entity241 : $ 900 million founder of the @entity244 @entity246 @entity245 : $ 800 million chairman , @entity248 @entity9 @entity10 : $ 800 million chairman of @entity11 @entity251 @entity250 : $ 800 million president and ceo of @entity254 @entity7 @entity8 : $ 700 million founder of the real estate company @entity256 @entity258 @entity257 : $ 600 million chairman of @entity260 @entity262 @entity261 : $ 600 million chairman of @entity264 @entity266 @entity265 : $ 400 million president and ceo of @entity254 @entity268 @entity267 : $ 300 million chairman and ceo of @entity270 the biggest winner of that crisis is also @entity2 ’s second wealthiest man @entity58 , whose current $ 59.8 billion worth had an unbelieveable $ 10 billion boost thanks to the @entity58 ’s smart investments while the market slumped in 2008			1
this means @entity58 is literally worth over a million times more than the average yearly household income in his home state of @entity60 , which is a mere $ 50,000			0
less surprising than number 2 ’s origins on the prairie , is number 3 ’s home state of @entity83 where the @entity284 has truly lived up to its name for @entity85 ’s @entity82			0
@entity82 is currently worth an estimated $ 46.4 billion			0
easy going : @entity85 ceo @entity82 is the thrid richest man in @entity2 and the richest man in @entity83			2
@entity82 's signature @entity289 , @entity83 pad is modeled after an ancient @entity292 emperor 's residence and cost about $ 70 million			0
and with his $ 46.4 billion , he 's also somewhat of a collector of homes kansan : @entity86 is the richest man in @entity87 but he 's more likely to be seen gallivanting around @entity296 or @entity297 with his many billions clocking in at number 4 is @entity86 , half of the noted politically active @entity86 brothers who hail from the state of @entity87			1
@entity86 ’s fortune alone is $ 41.5 billion			0
and from one of the poorest states comes the fifth richest @entity2 — @entity48 heir and ceo of @entity93 @entity90 , worth $ 37.1 billion			1
while his primary residence is listed in @entity307 , @entity75 , @entity47 is more likely to be seen on the golf courses of @entity297 , @entity157 or the @entity309 , where he also owns homes			0
equally less at home in his home state , or perhaps more so , is @entity43 , who took his $ 6.6 billion , renounced his @entity2 citizenship , and fled to @entity314 in 1994			0
@entity316 , his business holdings peg him as @entity154 ’s richest man , according to @entity35 @entity318 : like the @entity86 brothers , billionaire @entity94 has been known to use his money to sway national politics , though he hails predominantly from the state of @entity95 , where he owns the @entity324 hotel made of money : despite being a college drop out from the @entity327 , @entity94 has made around $ 32.2 billion as a casino magnate in @entity329 , @entity95 and around the world			2

@entity2 's richest man remains @entity25 's @entity15 , who is worth $ 70.8 billion
but wealth resides outside the coastal states , with the top ten richest in @entity2 also hailing from *landlocked* @entity75 , @entity87 , and @entity60
