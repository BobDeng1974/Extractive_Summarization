by @entity0 a training program designed to test a woman 's compatibility as an office secretary in 1959 has been unearthed by @entity6 blog			1
the 25 - point list , which was compiled for an unknown company in @entity9 , @entity10 , reveals the skills you 'd need to fit right in to ' the business world ' as a woman in mid-century @entity15			1
' is my voice pleasing and well modulated ? ' is among one of the more amusing requirements			0
' when people bore me , do i conceal it ? ' perfect poise : a 25 - point checklist , unearthed from the @entity24 , reveals what it takes to be a secretary in 1959 , and some of the requirements are somewhat hilarious and although it would be entirely unacceptable to print some of these phrases on a job application in this day and age , it goes without saying that some of these sentiments will still serve you well today			1
' do i control my impulse to meddle in other people 's business ? ' it asks , ' do i avoid gossiping ? ' some self - evaluational questions come off as a little more controversial to the modern eye			1
if you happen to be intelligent , or possess a mind of your own , for example , you 'd better not show it			0
' do i refrain from showing off how much i know ? ' it begs			0
' do i refrain from talking about myself ? ' the list in full : a score of 80 per cent reveals a ' good personality rating for the business world ' , and falling short of this requires you to ' work towards personal improvement ' and , reasonably enough , the list certainly seems to be eking out any sort of cattiness in the workplace			0
' do i avoid making fun of others behind their back ? ' it asks			0
' do i refrain from making sarcastic remarks ? ' many of the requirements on the list compare easily to the current job description for a secretary on @entity69			2
am i always on the alert to improve my vocabulary , pronunciation , and grammar ? the 1959 list poses the questions : ' do i smile readily and naturally ? ’ and ‘ can i talk to the boss as easily as to the office boy ? ' @entity78 suggests an applicant should be ' friendly and polite ( manners cost nothing after all ) ' , ' @entity83 ' and the owner of ' a bright and positive attitude			2
' having said that , no job description today would stretch as far as : ' am i always on the alert to improve my vocabulary , pronunciation , and grammar ? ' and if you assumed , with the advance of technology , that secretaries were now a dying breed - think again			2
according to the @entity94 , the most common job for a woman in today 's @entity15 is - drum roll - a secretary , followed by a cashier , a teacher and then a nurse			1
and of the four million secretaries employed in 2010 ; only 4 per cent of them were men			0
not a dying breed : according to the @entity94 , the most common job for a woman in today 's world is still a secretary , and this shows no sign of changing additionally , according to the @entity112 projections , it 's a category that is on the up , and set to grow 12 per cent between 2010 and 2020			1
@entity114 , spokesman for the @entity115 told @entity116 last year : ' [ @entity117 ] every time a major new technology showed up , there were always predictions that this would spell the end of secretaries			0
' you saw that with the development of electric typewriters , the personal computer and the internet , but every time technology gets more efficient ... you continue to need people who can use those tools			0
' perhaps in the future , we will look back on today 's job descriptions and chortle ; but in any case it would seem , long live the secretary .			1

the 25 - point requirement list for a secretary role has been revealed in a 1959 training manual
