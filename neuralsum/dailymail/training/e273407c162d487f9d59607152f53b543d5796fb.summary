by @entity0 published : 15:01 est , 16 october 2013 updated : 16:41 est , 16 october 2013 all grandparents dream of greatness for their grandchildren - but one man 's bet that his baby grandson would one day play international football has paid off in spectacular style			1
when sixteen - year - old @entity11 @entity10 ran out on to the pitch against @entity13 last night for his national side , he made history as the youngest - ever player for @entity17			1
but he also made his grandfather £ 125,000 , and an early retirement , after @entity20 , 62 , bet £ 50 in 2000 that his grandson , aged just 18 months , would one day represent his country			1
long - shot : @entity20 won £ 125,000 on odds of 2,500 - 1 when his son played his first game for @entity17 the odds of 2,500 - 1 did nothing to stop mr @entity20 making the confident bet , and last night 's appearance as a substitute confirmed his excellent talent - spotting abilities			1
mr @entity10 , who plays in @entity33 's under - 18s squad , came on in the 87th minute last night before the game concluded as a 1 - 1 draw between the @entity37 and @entity38 teams			1
mr @entity20 , who services electrical cables for a living , said he retired immediately when his grandson took to the field , while he watched the game on his ipad from his caravan in @entity45			1
he works away from his home in @entity47 , @entity48 , most of the year and sees his wife @entity50 , 58 , just once a fortnight			0
but he was able to retire early thanks to his winnings , which he says will be used in part to support mr @entity10 's development as a professional footballer			2
he said today : ' i 've retired one year early			2
i have come home now and will not be going back			0
not bad for a daft bet			1
record player : mr @entity10 is @entity17 ' youngest - ever national player , beating the record previously held by @entity61 ' i retired immediately			1
i told my manager yesterday that if @entity10 plays i would n't be coming back			2
' he said he put on the original bet on a whim after seeing how @entity10 liked playing with a football even as a toddler			2
' he used to chase the ball around the front room on his hands and knees even before he could walk , that 's what gave me the idea			0
but i hoped the bet would come up			0
' young talent : mr @entity10 can be seen being prepped for action by @entity17 manager @entity77 last night mr @entity10 plays on the left wing , the same as @entity61 , the @entity79 superstar whose record as the youngest @entity37 player he beat last night aged just 16 years 207 days , compared to mr @entity61 's 16 years 315 days			1
@entity82 said : ' it was a historic moment and very a proud one for the whole family			0
' we 're delighted for @entity10 and of course @entity20 's bet makes it all the better - we had the champagne out last night			1
' we all knew @entity10 would make it one day but no one expected it was going to be quite this soon			2
warming the bench : mr @entity10 , right , came on as a substitute in the 87th minute			2
he had previously sat out a game against @entity96			0
' it 's great that he 's broken the record set by @entity61 - they are some really big boots to fill			0
' he 's such a talented boy - he was kicking a football as soon as he was standing up			0
' my husband always enjoyed a flutter on the horses and on the football and one day he just decided he was going to place the bet			0
' it 's something which has really paid off now			0
' mr @entity20 also revealed that he tried to make a second bet on @entity10 's prospects at the @entity111 shop in @entity112 , but was politely refused in light on @entity10 's more obvious talents			1
he said : ' @entity10 was about 12 then			2
but they turned me down and said i already had a substantial bet with them			0
but they threw in @entity120 as a gesture of goodwill			0
' it meant even if the teenager had opted to play for @entity120 , something he could have done because his grandmother was born in @entity127 , the pay - out would have been safe			0
mr @entity20 said : ' this means i will be able to help @entity10 out			1
you can be quite sure that he will get a share of it			0
' a @entity111 spokesman said : ' @entity20 has been able to quit his job as a result of his amazing ability to spot fledgling talent earlier than almost anyone else we 've ever taken a bet from			1

@entity20 , 62 , made the 2,500 - 1 bet when his grandson was a baby
@entity10 came good last night when he took to the pitch as the youngest - ever player for @entity17
mr @entity20 has retired from his job with immediate effect , saying ' not bad for a daft bet '
