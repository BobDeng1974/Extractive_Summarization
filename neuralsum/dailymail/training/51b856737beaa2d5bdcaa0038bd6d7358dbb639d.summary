but the @entity9 show reached disturbing new lows when a seven - year - old girl was the one left in distress			0
producers were accused of cruelty after the child was put up as a prize – and had to be consoled when her mother failed to ‘ win ’ her			1
@entity18 ... distraught : @entity20 was devastated to learn that she was inches away from her daughter so close : @entity20 's daughter was disappointed that she missed out on seeing her mother hundreds of viewers took to social networking sites and internet discussion forums yesterday to complain about the treatment of @entity28 , the daughter of jungle competitor and former @entity31 actress @entity20			1
miss @entity32 had been paired with a fellow contestant , darts champion @entity33 , and given the opportunity to win luxuries by choosing one of five doors to open			2
they did not know that behind the doors the prizes included food , clean clothes – and various members of their friends and family			0
@entity28 , who had been away from her mother for 18 days , was standing behind a yellow door			1
the youngster could hear her mother ’s voice and was heartbroken when miss @entity32 and mr @entity33 picked the wrong colour to reveal a sign which said ‘ game over ’			1
millions of viewers saw @entity28 ’s distress as she realised she would not see her mother and had to be consoled by one of mr @entity33 ’s sons , who was next to her			1
tough blow : @entity20 described learning that her daughter could have been so close was like being ' kicked in the gut ' pulling at the heartstrings : @entity20 was left in tears at the thought of her daughter being so close it was only after learning that two fellow contestants had got to see their loved ones that miss @entity32 , 31 , realised she had missed the opportunity to see her daughter			1
she was left distraught and made a tearful apology to the cameras , saying : ‘ it felt like someone had taken a boot and kicked me in the guts			0
' i did n’t even think having a member of family behind the door would have been an option			2
’ yesterday experts and campaigners called on tv watchdog @entity84 to investigate the decision to involve @entity28 in the contest , which is filmed in @entity87 , while others accused @entity32 of bad parenting for not leaving the jungle to comfort her daughter as soon as she learned what had happened			1
what 's behind each door : @entity20 and @entity33 were first to have a go at the @entity96 game , she did n't know her daughter @entity28 was behind the yellow door end of the line : the pair chose the blue door and were greeted with a ' game over ' sign @entity105 , of campaign group parents outloud , said : ‘ if [ @entity20 ] was genuine about this , she would have got up and walked straight to her daughter and not put her daughter in this position again			1
‘ i find it staggering that [ producers ] have used a child in this way			0

over the moon : the pair looked delighted to be greeted by their loved ones group hug : @entity128 was seen hugging her daughter while @entity129 was delighted his mother was there to meet him viewers took to the internet to express their outrage at @entity28 ’s treatment			1
