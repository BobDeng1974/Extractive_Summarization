a baby boy who was born with his bowel , intestines and liver on the outside of his body due to a rare birth defect has inspired his family and doctors with his miraculous recovery			1
doctors thought it would be a year before @entity11 , who was born in january , would be able to have the organs tucked inside his body - but he underwent reconstructive surgery this summer			1
@entity11 's parents , @entity16 and @entity17 , from @entity18 , @entity19 , revealed their son 's amazing recovery as they threw a benefit to help raise funds for his care this weekend			1
they first learned that something was not right during a routine ultrasound at 19 weeks			0
fighter : @entity11 , propped up on the family dog , shows his amazing recovery just nine months after he was born with his organs outside his body			1
he has now undergone reconstructive surgery the ultrasound showed a large sac at his stomach area and doctors told his stunned parents he suffered from a birth defect known as an @entity38 , where the organs grow outside the body			1
the condition is a type of hernia that develops in the baby before birth and only occurs in one in 10,000 babies , @entity42 reported			2
it meant that @entity11 was growing part of his abdominal organs in a protective sac near his umbilical cord			1
it affected his intestines , stomach and liver			0
@entity16 headed to the delivery room ahead of schedule due to high blood pressure , and she and her husband were surrounded by a team of doctors and nurses ready to ensure the baby 's survival			2
fears : a rare birth condition meant his liver , intestines and bowel were born in a sac outside his body fragile : the sac was bandaged and doctors thought it would be a year before he could have surgery condition : an @entity38 is a type of hernia that develops in the baby before birth to everyone 's relief , @entity11 let out a few strong screams and showed no signs of the potential heart and kidney trouble that can have fatal results for a newborn @entity38			1
' really the test is when he 's here how he does , so it 's always very reassuring when babies come out and they cry , ' his doctor , dr @entity92 , said just after the birth			0
' once he got over here he needed a little bit more help with his breathing so he has a tube down his windpipe			0
' @entity11 was immediately slipped into a medical zip - lock bag to preserve body heat and fluid , and he was rushed to the @entity105 at nearby @entity106			1
while doctors had expected to wait a year before putting his organs back inside his body , they discovered he was the best case scenario and he underwent surgery in june			1
miracle : but doctors deemed @entity17 and @entity16 's baby boy , all pictured after his birth in january , strong enough to have surgery after five months and now he is recovering well growing boy : just months later and @entity11 is doing well			1
his parents are raising money for his health costs happy : the family keeps relatives , friends and strangers updated with their progress on a blog ' he 's doing fantastic , ' @entity11 's physician , dr. @entity128 , told @entity42			2
