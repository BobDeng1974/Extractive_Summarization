the ex-wife of an @entity2 oil magnate who was awarded one of the biggest divorce settlements in @entity7 history says she is still planning an appeal even though she cashed the $ 970million check			1
@entity10 , the ex-wife of @entity2 oil magnate @entity11 , cashed the check that @entity13 provided her last week			1
in november , an @entity2 court ordered the @entity15 ( @entity16 ) chief executive to pay his ex-wife about $ 1 billion in cash and assets when the couple divorced after a 26 - year marriage			1
but @entity10 has appealed the case in the @entity41 , claiming that the earlier ruling allowed @entity13 to keep the vast majority of a marital estate worth up to $ 18 billion			1
legal experts say it may be more difficult for @entity10 to pursue an appeal after accepting the benefits of the trial court 's award			2
real estate portfolio : @entity10 also picked up three properties in the divorce , including this home in @entity55 , @entity2 the @entity55 home has been valued at $ 800,000 and was one of three the couple owned in @entity2 @entity59 's appeal does not say anything about the property she was awarded in the divorce @entity59 also got the couple 's second @entity2 home located in @entity65 and worth $ 4.6million ' i will not dismiss my appeal and do not feel that my right to appeal should be denied because i have accepted , in the interim , a small portion of the estate that we built over more than two decades , ' @entity10 said in a statement through her lawyers			1
last week , one of @entity13 's lawyers , @entity75 , told @entity77 that @entity10 's deposit of the oil man 's check in an @entity82 bank was likely to end her case			1
if she continues an appeal , @entity84 said , @entity13 will try to have it dismissed on grounds she has already accepted the benefits of the earlier ruling			2
the couple never signed a prenuptial agreement			0
the @entity13 divorce has been ongoing since 2012 and last month , @entity13 pledged to appeal the decision , after a sharp fall in oil prices cut billions from his personal fortune			2
the earlier court ruling allowed @entity13 to retain his 68 percent stake in @entity15 , which he founded in 1967			0
@entity13 had already paid his former wife more than $ 20 million during the divorce proceedings			2
@entity10 has taken ownership of the @entity102 in @entity103 , @entity104 , a property purchased by the couple in 2011 for $ 14.7million , along with the couple 's two of their @entity2 properties , as per the court 's ruling			1
mr. @entity11 will take their $ 750,000 home in @entity114 , @entity115 and a $ 300,000 log cabin that sits on 154 acres in @entity117 , @entity2			1
big growth : during the course of their marriage , @entity13 's company 's worth jumped from $ 50million to $ 20billion @entity10 made it clear she believed the marital wealth she was entitled to had been grossly undervalued			1
the only spouse to ever score a bigger settlement in the @entity7 was @entity127 , who reportedly received $ 2.5billion after splitting with her businessman and art dealer husband @entity128 in 1999			0
@entity59 stated that she felt that the decision by judge @entity131 to allow lawyers for both her husband and for @entity15 to be involved in the proceedings was ' inappropriate ' in that it allowed them to ' double team ' her			0
the crux of the argument though comes down to how much money the company and mr. @entity11 made beginning in 1988 , the year he and @entity10 were married			1
during the trial it was argued that @entity15 ’s growth stemmed mostly from passive factors , such as rising oil prices , and , under @entity2 law , only the ' active ' portion of wealth accrued during marriage in previously acquired assets is subject to division			1
@entity10 ’s lawyers contend however that @entity154 miscalculated what was due to her by attributing only a small portion of a $ 14billion rise in the value of @entity13 's @entity15 shares during the marriage - 6 percent			1
' as @entity10 has stated previously , 6 percent is not a fair proportion of the wealth the couple accumulated during their marriage , and she trusts that a more equitable division of the marital estate will result from this appeal , ' her legal team said in a statement			1
big score : in 2012 , @entity13 was one of the select few named to the @entity173 , an event he attended with his wife @entity10 , who worked as a lawyer for @entity15 when she and @entity13 married , and went on to take a series of executive roles at the company , also claims that @entity154 undervalued her own contributions to the couple ’s wealth			2
most estimates have stated that @entity15 was worth around $ 50million in 1988 when the couple married , which is just a drop in the well when compared to the $ 20billion behemoth it is today			0
a behemoth that @entity13 has a 68 percent stake in , a stake he lost none of in the divorce as it was determined to be ' separate property			0
' all this , combined with lingering timeline questions presented by @entity10 that question whether strategic moves that ultimately yielded giant profits for the company happened before or after the couple 's 1988 wedding , will likely cause this case to drag on for as long as two more years			0
and there 's somehow more			0
friends in high places : 2012 was also the year @entity13 became an adviser for the @entity208 campaign that aforementioned $ 9billion fortune of @entity13 's was in fact a $ 20billion fortune as recently as august , with the oil baron forced to watch over half his worth slip away due to a drop in the price of crude oil			2
filing for divorce in march 2013 , @entity10 alleged in court papers that her husband was having an affair , citing that as the reason for termination of the marriage			2
@entity13 had over the course of their marriage grown to become one of the richest men in the world , a far cry from his youth and a true embodiment of the @entity7 dream			0
born one of 13 children to a sharecropper , @entity13 worked his way up , picking cotton as a child , pumping gas and fixing cars by the time he was 20 and eventually saving up enough money to drill his first well			0
and while @entity13 , who was previously married and has three children from that union , is no fan of the spotlight , he has not exactly shunned it over the past few years			0
in 2012 , @entity13 became a big part of @entity208 's presidential campaign when he was appointed energy adviser , a gesture he thanked the politician for by donating $ 985,000 to the @entity253			0
mr. @entity11 also hosted a fundraiser at his $ 4.6 million @entity255 , @entity2 mansion for the @entity258 candidate , which raised more than $ 2million			1
it is worth noting that the @entity65 mansion is no longer @entity13 's but , along with a $ 800,000 home in @entity55 , @entity2 , the property of @entity10			1
it was also in early 2012 that @entity13 earned the biggest accolade of his life when he was added to the @entity173 for that year			0
he and his wife attended the ceremony together that april in @entity271 that also honored , among others , @entity274 , supreme court associate justice @entity275 , president @entity276 and @entity277			0
the two posed on the red carpet together , smiling for the cameras with their arms around one another , looking happy and excited			0
@entity10 would file for divorce less than a year later .			0
