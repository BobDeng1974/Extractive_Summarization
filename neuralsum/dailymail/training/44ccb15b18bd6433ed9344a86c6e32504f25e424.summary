by @entity0 published : 19:50 est , 31 december 2012 updated : 19:50 est , 31 december 2012 there is a 50:50 chance that @entity3 will slide into a devastating triple - dip recession this year , leading economists warn today			1
output ‘ probably ’ fell in the final three months of 2012 and could do so again in the first three months of 2013 , said the @entity7 and @entity8			1
another two quarters of decline in a row would mean the third recession in five years and set the scene for another bleak year			0
crisis : the @entity3 could suffer a triple - dip recession with the crisis in the eurozone proving a major challenge for the economy the think - tank singled out the crisis in the eurozone as ‘ a major challenge for the @entity3 economy ’ , given it is @entity3 ’s biggest trading partner			1
a weak recovery in @entity3 would blow a gaping hole in its creaking finances and cost the country its coveted @entity30 credit rating			1
business leaders will today call for ‘ bold moves ’ from ministers to unleash growth in 2013 – including investment in infrastructure and an assault on red tape			1
@entity39 , of the @entity40 , will say the government risks doing ‘ too little too late ’ to bolster the economy and get young people into work			2
cutting defecit ? : @entity45 will struggle to cut @entity41 borrowing and get national debt under control ‘ we need a clear , agreed and long - term push to improve @entity3 ’s business environment before we reach a point of no return – leading to decades of stagnation and further decline , ’ he will add			2
city economists are predicting growth of only 1.1 per cent in 2013 and 1.7 per cent in 2014 , followed by 2 per cent in 2015 and 2.1 per cent in 2016			1
that is far weaker than expected by the @entity58 and will leave @entity45 struggling to cut government borrowing and get the ballooning national debt under control			0
the @entity62 , the government ’s official forecaster , last month predicted growth of 1.2 per cent in 2013 and 2 per cent in 2014 , followed by 2.3 per cent in 2015 and 2.7 per cent in 2016			1
@entity66 , of financial research group @entity67 , said the forecasts were too optimistic			0
‘ the outlook for growth is very weak			2
bumping along the bottom is the order of the day , and double , triple , quadruple , and n - tuple dips are the likely corollary , ’ he added			0
such an outcome would wreak havoc with the chancellor ’s plans to cut borrowing , having inherited a record deficit of £ 159billion from @entity82			0
@entity83 fell to £ 142billion in the @entity84 ’s first year in power and again to £ 121billion last year but the decline has not been as fast as mr @entity45 predicted			0
he now hopes to cut the annual deficit to £ 31billion by 2017 - 18 – but this will require yet more austerity and could prove optimistic if the recovery does not live up to the @entity58 ’s expectations			0
the @entity92 warns that the deficit will be around £ 75billion in 2017 - 18 and the chancellor will borrow almost £ 100billion more than expected between now and then – pushing the national debt to ever more dangerous levels .			0

output will ' probably ' fall in the first three months of 2013
@entity101 crisis is ' a major challenge for the @entity3 economy ' as it is @entity3 *'s* major trading partner
weak recovery in @entity3 would cost country coveted @entity30 credit rating
city economists predict growth of 1.1 *percent* in 2013 and 2 per cent in 2014
