' i have talked with him because i thought he was forcing himself too much to score a goal			0

' but all thanks to @entity56			0
he was world - class and got us three points			0
' defeat left @entity9 one place above the relegation zone and there was more bad news for @entity76 when defender @entity77 was carried off with an ankle injury that is likely to rule him out of @entity13 's @entity80 qualifiers against @entity81 and @entity82			2
