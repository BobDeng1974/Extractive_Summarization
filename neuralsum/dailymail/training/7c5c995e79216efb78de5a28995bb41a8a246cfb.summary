by @entity0 a @entity2 shopping mall has installed a plus - sized , women - only zone to cater for female drivers who have trouble parking			1
the zone , marked with a sign reading : ' respectfully reserved for women ' , is situated outside the @entity10 ( @entity12 ) centre in @entity13 in north - east @entity2 's @entity15 province			1
it features ten parking spaces which are painted pink and around 30 centimetres wider than normal			1
women - only : the @entity19 in @entity13 has installed a plus - sized , women - only zone to cater for female drivers who have trouble parking			1
above , the centre 's manager @entity24 speaks in the zone it is the latest in a string of women - only zones to have emerged in car parks across @entity2 , where the middle class is bulging and more people have the income necessary to buy and drive vehicles			1
other places to have introduced them include @entity39 - @entity38 shopping centre in @entity41 city , @entity43 province , and a building materials mall in @entity45 , northern @entity2			1
the pink - ringed parking spaces have sparked debate in @entity2 , which officially embraces gender equality but where old - fashioned sexism is rife in reality			1
the @entity10 , situated in the centre of the northern port city of @entity13 , is one of thousands of other retail complexes to have sprouted across the country as part of a vast urbanisation drive			2
wide : the zone features ten parking spaces which are painted pink and around 30 cms wider than normal @entity61 - ringed : it is marked with a sign reading : ' respectfully reserved for women			1
' above , the parking spaces it features dozens of chain clothing stores , fast food franchises , glass lifts , a cinema , and @entity71 , which has become a favourite hangout of @entity2 's new middle class			1
according to its management , the plus - sized , women - only spaces were created outside its main entrance after female drivers had trouble parking in the standard basement slots			1
' i think this is very convenient , ' user @entity83 told @entity86			0
' other parking spaces are too narrow			0
' she added : ' it 's not gender biased			0
it 's just that women have a few issues with vision when parking			2
' but the spaces have provoked outrage on social media - with many accusing the shopping centre of sexism and cliched thinking			2
' this is supposed to respect women , but actually it 's an insult , ' said an unnamed woman			0
today , the mall 's manager , @entity24 , defended the larger pink - ringed parking spots , deeming them ' practical '			1
' we just wanted to make things easier for women , who make up most of our customers , ' she said			0
' it 's not an insult to women at all			0
if their parking spaces are larger , it 's only for practical reasons			2
it does n't mean that women drive less well than men			0
' however , the policy appears to be at odds with statistics on driving fatalities			0
a study titled ' @entity127 in @entity2 ' published last january , revealed there were more than 67,000 people killed in road traffic crashes , including parking incidents , in 2009			2
one of the significant risk factors was gender			0
but contrary to the apparent belief of the shopping mall planners , men have a far higher risk of crashing then women			0
in the study , fatal crashes by male drivers were more than three times than that of female drivers			1
lower car insurance quotes for women than men also suggests that women are safer drivers , regardless of reputation			2
ladies only : it is the latest in a string of women - only zones to have emerged in car parks across @entity2			1
above , this building materials mall in @entity45 , northern @entity2 , introduced a pink women - only parking zone last year officially , @entity2 proclaims the sexes equal in keeping with @entity161 principles , and revolutionary @entity162 once said that ' women hold up half the sky '			1
but conservative attitudes remain deeply ingrained , and women are conspicuous by their rarity in the upper echelons of @entity2 politics and the ruling party , dominated by men in black suits			2
one online poster on the @entity13 car park said : ' the two most dangerous things in the world are men who cook and women who drive			1
' manufacturers ' advertisements in the world 's biggest auto market are invariably aimed at male buyers , and a man at the mall , @entity185 , said : ' women do n't really know how to park a car			0
' ' the few times i 've come close to crashing was basically with women driving the other car , ' he added			0
' i 've noticed they 're a bit rough at the wheel , they only look forwards , too often they ignore their mirrors			0
' the latest @entity2 controversy echoes a series of microblog posts @entity202 police made last year advising women on driving techniques			2
these included not wearing high heels , releasing the handbrake before setting off and not panicking if they suddenly realise they are going the wrong way			0
' some women drivers lack a sense of direction , and while driving a car , they often hesitate and are indecisive about which road they should take , ' read one of the entries on the police department 's verified microblog			2
another featured a cartoon depicting a confrontation between a police officer and a woman driving a vehicle shaped like a large red high - heel shoe			0
according to a @entity231 estimate in march 2013 , globally males are more likely to be involved in accidents than females , and 77 percent of all road traffic deaths occur among men			0
even so , for some , the women - only parking places amounted to discrimination against male drivers			1
' it 's always women who enjoy privileges ! ' complained one			0
' men have become the weaker sex			0
' the news comes just months after similar spaces were introduced for female drivers at another shopping centre in @entity250 , @entity251 .			1

spaces installed at the @entity254 in @entity13 , north - east @entity2
they are painted pink and around 30 centimetres wider than normal spaces
cater for female drivers who have trouble parking , claims centre 's manager
latest in string of women - only spaces to have emerged in @entity2 car parks
