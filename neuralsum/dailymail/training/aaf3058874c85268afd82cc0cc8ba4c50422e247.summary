@entity7 - who in 2010 publicly accused @entity4 of sacking because her double d implants made her ' too attractive ' and ' too distracting ' to male co-workers - is now claiming to have suffered ' serious and severe permanent injuries ' following a visit to @entity12			1
in papers filed in @entity15 that were obtained by @entity16 , the 36 - year - old said she went to a @entity12 lab in @entity18 on july 3 , 2012 , and was treated by a nurse ' who lacked the requisite skills to draw blood without inflicting harm on her subjects '			1

back in court : ' too sexy for @entity4 ' banker @entity7 has filed a new lawsuit , this time against a @entity12 clinic in @entity33 , claiming to have suffered ' serious and severe permanent injuries ' while having blood drawn @entity7 shot to notoriety in 2010 for alleging her male bosses at @entity4 @entity37 found her work attire too steamy and fired her for it the lawsuit brought forward by @entity7 is said to have occurred here , at the the @entity12 lab in @entity18 , @entity33 , @entity37 they also allegedly ' failed to properly advise and instruct the plaintiff concerning post-procedure care '			1
strangely , the suit does not explain @entity7 's medical condition or clearly identify her injuries			2
it does however say she experienced ' severe shock and damage to her nervous system and certain internal injuries '			2
the visit also ' damaged her physcophysical motor skills '			2
@entity56 is defined as ' the branch of psychology that deals with the relationships between physical stimuli and sensory response '			0
while @entity7 declined to comment on the case , her lawyer , @entity62 , said the suit was not as strange as it sounds			2
@entity7 underwent xtensive plastic surgery to look like a ' cross between @entity67 and @entity68 ' in vein : personal banker @entity7 has been vague about the injuries she sustained when filing her current lawsuit			1
her lawyer said it related to ' nerve damage ' he claims the lab tech was struggling to draw blood from his client and ' she got nerve damage ' ' what ’s unusual about that ? ' @entity62 said			1
' sometimes they screw up			0
' the same lawsuit , filed in march , names a @entity33 driver who rear - ended her in a car accident in @entity86 in december 2012			2
@entity62 said both were named because his client developed more severe nerve damage after the car accident and ' we ’re not 100 % sure which incident caused the injury '			1
presumably @entity7 is expecting a more successful outcome with her current complaint than with her infamous @entity4 lawsuit			1
in 2003 , @entity7 took part in a 2003 tv show called @entity98 @entity97 for the @entity99			0
in the show she was filmed giggling at a plastic surgeon 's office as she discussed having a fourth boob job			0

she said she was ordered to stop wearing turtlenecks , pencil skirts , three - inch heels or fitted business suits			0
a 33 - year - old single mother at the time , @entity7 said other female colleagues wore much more revealing outfits than she did			1
' they said their body shapes were different from mine , and i drew too much attention , ' she said at the time			0
despite the far - reacing publicity her lawsuit agianst @entity4 garnered in 2010 , @entity7 received not a cent in damages , according to the banking giant the case eventually went in to arbitration , but @entity113 have since confirmed they did not pay her a thing in damages			1
@entity7 later went to work for @entity142 at branches in @entity144 and @entity33			0
public records show she left @entity142 in the summer and has since relocated to @entity146 , where she ’s working for @entity147			0
