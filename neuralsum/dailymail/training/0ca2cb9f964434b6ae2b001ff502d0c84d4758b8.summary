by @entity0 two very different men in two very similar cars will contest the 50th grand prix to be staged at @entity4 – the race that could go a long way to defining the lives and careers of @entity9 and @entity10			1
@entity9 is largely a public figure , a result of his craving for fame and the modern media ’s insatiable appetite for celebrity gossip			2
this week he told his 2.17million @entity19 followers that he spent a romantic break in @entity21 with his @entity23 girlfriend @entity22 to celebrate six years ( mostly ) together and had a lunch on a yacht in @entity26 with a-listers @entity27 and @entity29			2
rivals : @entity10 smiles as he sits next to @entity9 following his victory at the @entity33 @entity32 @entity21 : @entity9 posted a series of pictures from his latest holiday on @entity19 this week he also posted pictures of himself riding his push bike bare - chested			1
his @entity19 account is accompanied by the self - description : ‘ @entity41 until the day i die			0
’ in a certain nomenclature those initials stand for @entity44 as a mother * * * * * *			0
@entity10 , more measured and more cerebral , is essentially a private man			2
save for a tweet thanking fans for sending him birthday wishes – he turned 29 on friday – there is no word about his personal life from the moment he finished the @entity33 @entity32 victorious a week ago			1
that victory put the @entity57 29 points ahead of his @entity59 team - mate @entity9 in what is a private battle for the @entity62			1
@entity10 ’s advantage is not quite as big as it seems – under the old scoring system , where a win was worth 10 points rather than 25 , it would be a lead of about 12 , or one victory and a little bit more – but clearly @entity9 needs to stop his rival ’s momentum by winning for the first time since the @entity74 @entity32 on may 11			1
victorious : @entity10 lifts the trophy after triumphing at the @entity77 in @entity78 , @entity33 @entity79 : @entity9 sprays @entity10 after finishing second behind the @entity57 at the @entity33 @entity32 @entity80 , one of only 12 home winners of the @entity82 @entity32 , said : ‘ he needs to win this race big time			1
it is make or break – as important a grand prix for @entity9 as any in his career has ever been			1
he needs to respond to @entity10 ’s excellent performances by dominating him in every way , in qualifying and in the race			2
‘ he needs to reassert himself			0
it is not an issue of speed			0
in @entity33 it was a matter of not quite doing things accurately enough			2
he was not quite as exact in how he got into the pit box as he could have been , whereas @entity10 is maxing out on his potential , in his in - lap , his out - lap , pit stop			2
‘ @entity9 has always relied on his natural skills			1
’ @entity4 : @entity9 ( pictured ) is under pressure to beat @entity10 on home soil sir @entity104 , a twice winner of the @entity82 @entity32 and , like @entity80 , a survivor from the dangerous days of their sport , also sees @entity9 ’s over-reliance on @entity110 - given skill as the significant difference between the two men			1
‘ @entity9 is a natural , ’ said @entity104			1
‘ but he needs to get away from using only his natural talent , which is in danger of being detrimental to him			0
all the great drivers have had more than that			0
’ @entity104 himself developed his mind - management long before he got into @entity119			2
he reached international standard in clay pigeon shooting as a boy , learning that if he missed a target it was gone for ever			0
you could not recover your position on the next corner			0
the calmness and calculation of @entity104 is more evident in @entity10 , a driver @entity104 observed at close quarters during the @entity57 ’s years at @entity130			1
‘ @entity10 was not fully developed then , ’ he said			2
‘ he was not quite training as hard as he is now			0
he has full race distance ability now			0
he has a very good brain and is totally focused on his motor - racing			0
he has been engaged for while and is close to getting married			0
he is very settled , and that can help performance			0
’ helping : @entity139 says @entity9 is well - prepared for the @entity82 @entity32 and is motivated to do well the man trying to help @entity9 is another driving luminary of the @entity142 , @entity139 , the @entity59 non-executive chairman			1
@entity139 told me yesterday that his @entity82 driver is ‘ very well balanced , not sad , but motivated ’			0
but @entity80 is less convinced			2
‘ pictures of him having lunch with @entity27 is great for @entity9 ’s management – @entity148 and @entity149 – because it gets their client profile , but at the end of the day it is all about winning the world championship			2
‘ it would be a brave person to say that his private life is impacting on his professional life , but i do n’t know who in the team has the ability to put their arms around @entity9 in the way @entity165 could and did			1
‘ @entity139 ’s job is to see @entity59 win			1
@entity168 ( the executive technical director ) is a superb engineer but he is not a team principal and @entity170 , well , he ’s more of a businessman			0
’ meeting : @entity9 ( right ) , has lunch with @entity27 and @entity29 in the south of @entity174 mercedes seem likely to win at @entity4 despite the upturn in @entity130 ’s fortunes at the @entity77 last week because the aerodynamic demands of the @entity180 track are better suited to them			1
that raises the prospect of @entity9 recreating one of the most epic performances ever seen on a @entity82 track – his win in the wet in 2008			1
‘ the @entity82 fans are the absolute best in the world and it ’s really humbling to see thousands of people out there cheering you on , no matter what the weather or the result , ’ he said			0
good memories : @entity9 celebrates on the podium at @entity4 after his stunning win in 2008 ‘ when i won in 2008 it was just the best feeling			1
the gap was about 60 second at the end and i had lapped everyone up to third place , which was just unreal			0
' i could never have hoped or dreamed for a race like that , especially at my home grand prix			1
that has to be one of the best moments of my career			0
‘ i loved raising that gold trophy in front of the home crowd and i ’m determined to get my hands on it again this year			0

@entity59 pair will compete at the 50th grand prix to be held at @entity4
@entity10 *'s* win in @entity33 last week put him 29 points ahead of @entity9
former winner @entity80 says it is ' make or break time ' for the @entity228
sir @entity104 thinks @entity9 might rely too much on his natural skill
