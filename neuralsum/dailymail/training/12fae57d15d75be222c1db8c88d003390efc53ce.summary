devastated @entity4 , 73 , said he felt totally helpless as he could do nothing for his dying mother @entity6 except try to reassure her that paramedics were on their way			1
but as the hours ticked by with still no sign of help , her crippling abdominal pains grew worse until all she could do was cry out : ' i just want to die			1
' ambulance chiefs have now apologised to him after carrying out an investigation into the heartbreaking incident			1
write caption here mr @entity4 said : ' she had agonising stomach pain and we were told the ambulance would be a blue light job and would be with her very quickly			1
' but by the time she got to hospital it was nearly four hours			0
' no - one should have to wait for an ambulance that length of time in any circumstances			2
' the furious pensioner added : ' i could n't do anything for her and it was difficult for her to move because she was in such pain			0
' i could n't give her anything			0
i 'm not a medical man and as far as i knew the ambulance would be there any minute			2
' when the reception rang to see where the ambulance was they were told it was on its way			2
' mr @entity4 , of @entity44 , near @entity45 , @entity46 , said that when the 999 vehicle finally arrived it was a @entity49			1
happy memories : @entity4 with his mother @entity6 in 2005			1
ambulance chiefs have now apologised to him after carrying out an investigation into the heartbreaking incident and in a new cruel blow the crew were not able to administer the crucial morphine his mother so desperately needed			1
the distressed family was then forced to wait further as a paramedic was called			0
' we keep reading of similar cases and the situation does n't seem to get any better , ' said mr @entity4 , who worked at @entity66 , @entity67 , for 20 years			2
' i feel very let down			0

there was then a further nine - minute delay until a paramedic could arrive and after that mrs @entity78 was taken to @entity85			0
ambulance chiefs say crew rotas are to be revised to increase cover in the county following concerns about demand outweighing resources			1
an @entity94 spokeswoman said in mrs @entity78 's case the doctor 's receptionist said ' the doctor had asked for an ambulance within an hour but did not request an emergency vehicle , simply transport '			2
the hour - deadline was not met because the service was so busy , she said			0
but officials did call to check on mrs @entity78 's condition twice during the delay and were told she had not worsened and had no critical symptoms			0
' we have written to the complainant with a full apology and the results of an investigation conducted into this incident , ' said the spokeswoman			2
' this was a request for non-emergency transport to hospital based on a gp 's assessment that the patient had stomach pain and no critical symptoms			0
' occasionally demand outweighs resource and regrettably this was one of those times ' - spokeswoman , @entity127 ' due to workload with patients in greater immediate need we did not pick up the patient within the hour requested but made regular calls to check her symptoms had n't worsened			1
' unfortunately demand was extremely high with many 999 calls as well as urgent gp admissions like this			0
' there were also ambulances unable to handover patients at hospital due to a high number of admissions which meant delays in them becoming available			0
' occasionally demand outweighs resource and regrettably this was one of those times			1
' but in order to address this issue rotas are being revised in @entity46 so that not only will the county have more resources , particularly in @entity67 which will see coverage increased by more than 115 vehicle hours a week , but they will be better placed to get to patients when and where they are needed			0
