@entity0 , the former @entity2 seal who claims he killed @entity4 says the government had no intention of bringing back the @entity8 chief alive and @entity9 believed they were on a suicide mission			1
' the more we trained on it the more we realized this is going to be a one - way mission , ' said @entity0 in the first clips of his eagerly anticipated interview with @entity17 which will air tonight on @entity18			1
' we ’re going to go and we ’re not going to come back			0
we ’re going to die when the house blows up , we ’re going to die when he blows up , or we ’re going to be there too long , we get arrested by the @entity22 , and we ’re going to spend the rest of our lives in a @entity22 prison			0
' dramatic : @entity0 will give his version of events to @entity17 on tuesday night during the networks ' @entity29 who killed @entity4 ' special appearing on the @entity32 , ' the man who killed @entity4 ' , @entity0 describes how he got the fatal kill shot in first and ended the life of the world 's most wanted man			1
while @entity0 admits that two others fired shots at the terror leader , this is the first time that @entity0 has been seen interviewed on camera about the now legendary may , 2011 raid			1
he has faced severe criticism for coming forward so publicly , especially after he gave an anonymous account of the raid last year to @entity47 in which he was indentified only as ' @entity48 '			2
rear admiral @entity49 , the commander of the @entity50 urged @entity1 to regain their low profile			0
' at @entity50 's core is the @entity1 ethos , ' an october 31 letter said			2
' a critical tenant of our ethos is ' i do not advertise the nature of my work , nor seek recognition for my actions			0
' what 's done is done : @entity4 shooter @entity0 ( above ) said : ' he ( @entity4 ] died afraid , and he knew we were there to kill him			1
and that 's closure ' under fire : this comes as many are attacking @entity0 for making his identity as a @entity1 public @entity0 , who was unmasked last week by @entity72 as ' @entity48 ' , had been trained to use two head shots during missions - known in military circles as a double tap			1
however , according to the @entity77 , he told families of 9/11 victims there was ' no harm in putting one more bullet in him			0
' according to the paper , he made the comments during a secret meeting at the memorial museum at the @entity87 in july			0
describing the night of the raid , he said that he did n't know who ' the @entity89 ' was going into the mission			2
before his unit set off , he had time to make one , last phone call to his children , fearing he may never see them again			0
he recalled how he climbed into @entity4 's compound , walked upstairs and heard			1
his weapon then went : ' pop ! pop ! pop ! ' the audience , all relatives of people who died in the attacks on the @entity102 had no idea they would be receiving a first hand account of how the mastermind was killed			2
initially they were invited to a ' private and confidential ' event that included a talk by a ' mystery speaker '			0
last week , following his first televised interview , he said : ' he ( @entity4 ] died afraid , and he knew we were there to kill him			1
' down : @entity0 says of what happened , that anyone who questions him can only ask one other person what really happened , @entity4 ( above ) , and he 's dead @entity0 opened up about his meeting with the relatives of the 9/11 terror attacks saying : ' [ o ] ne thing i tell them is all right , @entity4 died like a p * * * *			1
that 's all i 'm telling you			2
' this was all revealed in a series of recorded interviews @entity0 had with journalist @entity132 that were aired on friday 's @entity134			1
he added that it does n't matter who ultimately took down the terrorist			0
' the most important thing that i 've learned in the last two years is to me it does n't matter anymore if i am @entity48 , ' @entity0 said			1
' regardless of the negativity that comes with it , i do n't give a f * * *			1
' site : @entity0 also revealed that he and his fellow @entity1 did not think they would return alive after the raid on @entity4 's hideout ( above ) he also revealed in these interviews that he and his fellow @entity1 did not think they would make it out alive after raiding @entity4 's hideout			1
' well , you have to go pump yourself up to go die			0
so we would talk about this , ' @entity0 said of their acknowledgement that this would likely be the end for them			2
' ( it was a ) group of guys who knew time on @entity161 was up , so you could be honest with each other			0
and we all accepted and nobody was afraid			0
' @entity0 's move to go public has been met with mixed response , and heavily criticzed among his fellow @entity1			1
he sees it differently however , pointing out how films like @entity169 and @entity170 both made his work very public , and that high ranking officials have no spoken openly about both incidents			0
' once anyone says anything at that level , it 's not classified , ' he said			2
' i was told by people that i ca n't even say i 'm a @entity1 , so i do n't give a f * * * what they think			1
' public guy : @entity0 seems fine with his detractors these days in interviews , saying he does n't care if people think he is ' full of s * * * ' as for those who question him , he is not letting it bother him			1
' even now , i mean , there are guys now saying that i am full of s * * * , ' he said			1
' you only know what you were told unless you were in the room			0
and unfortunately for me , there was two people in the room , and one of us is dead and that 's @entity4			1
' @entity0 is due to appear in a two - part documentary on @entity17 next week , detailing his part in the killing of @entity4			1
@entity72 exclusively disclosed his identity ahead of the broadcast			0
@entity206 has already described the night of may 2 , 2011 in an interview with @entity209 ’s ex-husband @entity208 that appeared in @entity47 in february 2013			1
but his name was not revealed at that time and he was referred to only as ‘ the shooter			0
’ now his identity has become public , military leaders and fellow seals are lining up to discredit his version of events			0
donation : @entity0 gave his seal team uniform the museum at the memorial to the september 11 terror attacks in @entity221 after meeting relatives of the victims of @entity4 's atrocity			1
it was then that he decided to tell the wider public that he was ' @entity48 ' speaking success : @entity0 is now a high - profile member of the motivational speaking circuit , openly revealing that he was a seal - but until now not declaring that he was involved in the daring raid which killed @entity4 a former @entity9 commander told the @entity231 only fired ‘ insurance shots ’ into @entity4 ’s twitching body after the terror leader had already been mortally shot by an unidentified seal who is still in the service			1
that hero is described as the ’ point man ’ who led the @entity1 up the stairs in @entity4 ’s compound to the bedroom where he was hiding			2
another @entity9 member also disputed @entity206 ’s version , saying the ' point man ' had wounded @entity4 with a shot to the side , and then grabbed the women in the room for fear they were wearing explosives			1
@entity206 , he said , had then finished @entity4 off			2
and @entity251 quoted an unidentified source close to a seal team 6 member as saying the fatal shot was fired by one of two other men who entered the room before @entity0			2
but @entity206 told @entity208 last year : ‘ i shot him , two times in the forehead			0
bap ! bap ! the second time as he 's going down			0
he crumpled onto the floor in front of his bed and i hit him again , @entity264 ! same place			0
that time i used my @entity267 red - dot holo sight			0
i watched him take his last breaths , just a reflex breath			0
’ one @entity1 source told @entity72 : ' the real shooter would never discuss it publicly			0
' members of @entity9 have n’t discussed it publicly so there ’s a reasonable chance he ’s not being truthful			2
' there is no way @entity206 could really prove it was he who took the fatal shot on @entity4 unless his comrades all attested to it			2
' but again , the code of secrecy with these special operators would preclude that			0
