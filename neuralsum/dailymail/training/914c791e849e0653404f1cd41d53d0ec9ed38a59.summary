by @entity0 published : 07:27 est , 4 april 2013 updated : 01:52 est , 5 april 2013 plans for a giant new £ 2bn theme park on the edge of @entity4 to rival @entity5 have been halted - by a colony of rare spiders			1
developers say the @entity10 scheme will be the third biggest theme park in the world and twice the size of the @entity14			1
it is due to create 27,000 jobs and was set to be completed by 2019			2
but an environmental audit of the 872 - acre brownfield site in the @entity19 in @entity20 has found it is home to distinguished jumping spiders			1
halted : plans to build a £ 2bn new theme park to rival @entity5 have been halted after a colony of rare spiders were discovered on the site rare : a colony of distinguished jumping spiders , which are found on only two sites in the @entity31 , has been discovered they are found on only two sites in the @entity31 and are on a biodiversity priority species list			1
the spiders are one of the few creatures that like the alkaline land created from the cement kiln dust produced by the former works on the site to the east of the @entity42			1
@entity43 , the consortium behind the theme park , will now have to find a new home for the colony			1
@entity47 , project director for @entity43 , yesterday said there are plans to create a 27 - acre wetland wildlife park at the park			2
he said : ' we will look after the spiders			2
we 're doing a good thing			0
' the alkaline land is dreadful for most forms of wildlife			0
but there is this particular spider that likes very alkaline conditions			2
' discovery : an environmental audit of the 872 - acre brownfield site in the @entity19 in @entity20 has found it is home to distinguished jumping spiders site : the spiders are found on only two sites in the @entity31 , including the site of the proposed theme park , and are on a biodiversity priority species list he said @entity43 hope to find a solution similar to that reached at the @entity76 where species found during development were moved to a wildlife sanctuary			1
@entity81 leader @entity80 said there are solutions to preserving unusual species			0
he said : ' in the past we 've moved fish , we 've sent voles away on holiday ; it 's fairly common and protects them from building works			0
then when they 're finished they 're brought back			0
' the only other @entity31 home for distinguished jumping spiders , which have the @entity97 sitticus distinguendus , are the @entity99 marshes in @entity100			1
both habitats are brownfield sites , or previously developed land			0
the spiders are on the @entity106 priority species list , but the list is not legally binding			2
plans : project director @entity47 has said the spiders will be looked after the ambitious resort will be located in the @entity19 in @entity20 , currently a brownfield site this means the @entity113 have deemed the species is threatened and one that requires conservation action			1
there is currently no law preventing developers building on the rare spiders ' home although there is a proposal for the species to be added to the @entity124			2
the ' world - class ' venue , supported by @entity10 , will feature @entity128 ’s largest indoor water park , theatres , live music venues , attractions , cinemas , restaurants , event space and hotels and , if given the green light , will be twice the size of @entity14 in @entity4			1
the site is on the doorstep of ebbsfleet international railway station , which is 17 minutes from @entity4 and two hours from @entity5			2
mr @entity47 has previously said the plans were @entity31 ’s biggest post-olympic project			0
lucrative : major films in the @entity10 stable include @entity145 ( left ) and @entity146 ( right ) ' our vision is to create a world - class entertainment destination , the first of its kind in the @entity31 , ' he said			1
' we are at the start of a long journey , but have been encouraged by the support and buy - in we have had to date			0
' we are particularly pleased with the appetite we are seeing from investors , who consider this a compelling investment proposition			0
there are 37 types of jumping spider in the @entity31 , but worldwide it is the largest spider family containing over five thousand species			1
they have a very large front pair of eyes , and are thought to possess the best vision for an invertebrate after cephalopods - octopus and relatives			0
this vision , along with an ability to jump , allows them to actively hunt their prey during the day			0
their keen eyesight also plays a part in courtship , where males can undertake elaborate dances to woo a female			0
@entity43 has signed an agreement with @entity184 , the licensing division of @entity10 , to give exclusive @entity31 licensing for a @entity10 entertainment resort at the heart of the site			1
@entity43 is also in negotiations with a range of major @entity31 brands to sign licensing agreements			0
@entity42 and @entity194 have both offered support for the project			0
there were previously six @entity10 theme parks in the @entity199 but these were all sold - off and re-branded during a company re-shuffle in 2006			1
today , they are operated without the @entity10 backing but in their heyday , rides on offer included @entity207 : the ride and @entity209 : stunt tracks			2
another @entity10 theme is set to open in @entity212 , @entity213 , in 2015 and company chiefs predict it will draw in three million visitors to the area every year			1
one of the main attractions in the pipeline is @entity220 , which will use state - of - the - art special effects to give guests a taste of the iconic vessel			0
meanwhile a @entity226 : impossible ride will take visitors through action scenes in a military - style vehicle .			0
