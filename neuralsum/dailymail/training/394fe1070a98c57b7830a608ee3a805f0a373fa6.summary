the men said nothing of substance as they shook hands , although after @entity8 ended the photo op by thanking assembled journalists , @entity10 cryptically added , in @entity73 , ' good luck , and good night '			1
appearing on @entity3 television ahead of his talks with @entity8 , @entity10 rejected suspicions that the deployment of tens of thousands of @entity3 troops near @entity7 is a sign @entity27 plans to invade the country following its annexation of the strategic @entity4 peninsula			1

@entity3 says the troops near the border are there for military exercises and that they have no plans to invade , but @entity9 and @entity102 officials say the numbers and locations of the troops suggest something more than exercises			0
and , despite the @entity3 assurances , @entity9 , @entity102 and @entity7 officials are deeply concerned about the buildup , which they fear could be a prelude to an invasion or intimidation to compel @entity19 to accept @entity27 's demands			2
in his interview , @entity10 made clear that @entity27 believes a federation is the only way to guarantee @entity7 's stability and neutrality			2
' we ca n't see any other way to ensure the stable development of @entity7 but to sign a federal agreement , ' @entity10 said , adding that he understood the @entity9 was open to the idea			0

@entity7 officials are wary of decentralising power , fearing that pro-russia regions would hamper its western aspirations and potentially split the country apart			0
however , they are exploring political reforms that could grant more authority to local governments			0
the plan that @entity8 and @entity10 are discussing covers @entity7 political and constitutional reforms as well as the disarmament of irregular forces , international monitors to protect minority rights and direct dialogue between @entity3 and @entity7 , according to @entity9 officials , who say it has backing of @entity7 's government			1
@entity8 and @entity10 have met several times in person and spoken by phone almost daily since the crisis began but have not yet been able to agree on a way forward			1

the pair met last week in @entity176 , where @entity8 presented @entity10 with the proposal , which was a response to ideas @entity10 gave him at a march 10 meeting in @entity181			1
sunday 's meeting follows an hour long phone call friday between @entity9 president @entity184 and @entity3 president @entity185 in which @entity184 urged @entity185 to withdraw his troops from the border with @entity7			0
the @entity3 leader , who initiated the call , asserted that @entity7 's government is allowing extremists to intimidate ethnic @entity3 and @entity3 - speaking civilians with impunity - something @entity7 insists is not happening			0
that call did little to reassure @entity9 officials that @entity3 is not planning to invade @entity7 after its annexation of @entity4 that the west has condemned as illegal and a violation of @entity7 's sovereignty and territorial integrity			0

in the interview with @entity3 television , @entity10 called the sanctions a ' dead - end ' strategy that would not achieve results and accused the west of hypocrisy			2
he said it was inconsistent for the west to refuse to recognize @entity4 's annexation , which followed a referendum on joining @entity3 that was overwhelmingly approved , while at the same time accepting the new government in @entity19 , which was formed after the @entity15 president fled the country			0
' if they are willing to accept the first event as legitimate , then surely they are obliged to acknowledge the second , ' @entity10 told @entity3 's @entity231 television			2

@entity240 officials described the call as ' frank and direct ' and said @entity184 had urged @entity185 to offer a written response to a diplomatic resolution to the @entity7 crisis that the @entity9 has presented			0
he urged @entity27 to scale back its troop buildup on the border with @entity7 , which has prompted concerns in @entity19 and @entity253 about a possible @entity3 invasion in eastern @entity7			0
the @entity241 , on the other hand , said @entity185 had drawn @entity184 's attention to a ' rampage of extremists ' in @entity7 and suggested ' possible steps by the international community to help stabilise the situation ' in @entity7 .			0
