by @entity0 published : 14:43 est , 8 august 2012 updated : 05:45 est , 9 august 2012 with mock @entity3 buildings , cobbled streets , red telephone boxes and a @entity7 church , it could be a quaint @entity8 town			1
but do n't be deceived - this bizarre settlement is actually some 5,700 miles away in @entity10			1
and unlike most places in the @entity14 , its population is shrinking			0
' @entity16 ' , about 19 miles from central @entity15 , is virtually a ghost town			1
replica : @entity16 , located 19 miles from @entity15 in @entity10 , has been built to look like an @entity8 town copy : developers have built mock tudor buildings in an attempt to recreate an @entity8 way of life imitation : a cyclist rides past a red telephone box in @entity16 , near @entity15 , modelled on the kiosks found in @entity14 the extraordinary settlement opened in 2006 as a replica of a small town in the @entity14			1
traditional buildings were copied and pubs and shops were imitated in an attempt to recreate the @entity14 way of life			0
developers even fashioned a artificial river to replicate the @entity40			0
at the time @entity41 , the head of one of the companies behind the development , @entity45 , said : ' i wanted the properties to look exactly the same as those in the @entity14			2
deserted : a view of a street in @entity16			2
the bizarre development has not proved as popular as hoped wizardry : a statue of @entity55 is situated in the middle of a housing development in @entity16 ' i think @entity8 properties are very special			1
' when we decide to learn from others , we should not make any improvements or changes			0
' however , a development which was designed to house about 10,000 people has not proved as popular as hoped			0
reports claim only a ' handful ' of people live there , but the place does attract tourists wishing to take pictures of its @entity8 - style architecture			2
@entity75 near @entity15 : a father carries his child through the rain in front of a tudor - style housing development snap : the town has a @entity7 church which has become a popular location for photography on wedding days @entity16 is n't the only place in @entity10 to have landmarks copied from the @entity14			1
last month @entity88 revealed how an almost identical version of @entity91 's @entity90 has been built in @entity92 , a city in the eastern province of @entity94			0
a replica @entity96 village has also been built in the southern @entity10 city of @entity99			0
the village , complete with artificial lake , is a copy of @entity103 in @entity104			0
contrast : the quaint surroundings of @entity16 could hardly be more different to the bustling environment of @entity15 city centre worlds apart : @entity16 is only located about 19 miles from the centre of @entity15 , but the two places are very different			1

@entity16 looks like an @entity8 town , but it is located 5,700 miles away
development 19 miles from central @entity15 has few *residents* and is virtually a ghost town
