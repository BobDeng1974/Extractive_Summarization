after undergoing the new ' spray - on ' skin treatment , @entity0 can wear her bikini with confidence scars are a constant and vivid reminder of an injury or illness that many people would prefer to forget			1
every year , countless hundreds of thousands are left with scarring following accidents , bad acne or surgery			0
but could a form of ' spray - on ' skin made from the patient 's own skin cells help ? one of those who have had the treatment is @entity0			1
when she discovered she had breast cancer for the second time at the age of 57 - nearly three decades after getting the all - clear - it came as a huge blow			2
but a double mastectomy , although traumatic , cut the risk of her cancer returning , and an immediate reconstruction meant it had minimal impact on her figure			0
however , @entity0 was left with a large scar stretching from hip to hip , where doctors had taken skin to use in the reconstructive surgery			2
' the surgeon did a wonderful job , with any scarring on the breast hidden , ' says @entity0 , now 62 , a nurse from @entity42 in @entity43			0
' but i hated that scar on my abdomen - it was shrunken , lumpy and red with white patches , around 10in long and nearly three - quarters of an inch wide			2
i was grateful to the surgeons for saving my life , but it left me with a very poor body image			0
' i 'm not fat and i 'm not old , but i still felt i had to cover up , even on the beach			0
' today , however , thanks to treatment with the new spray - on skin , her scar has almost disappeared			1
scars form when the dermis - the deeper , connective layer of the skin - is damaged			1
their severity depends on the extent of injury as well as the skin 's repair response , and on the behaviour of collagen , a protein that acts like a glue in wound healing			1
in normal skin , the collagen bundles are laid down in a neat , criss - cross pattern , and when healing goes smoothly , scars are flat and often improve in colour over time			1
but sometimes the repair process gets out of hand			0
cells known as fibroblasts , which produce collagen , go into overdrive and a new system of blood vessels is set up to feed the scar , which triggers extra collagen			2
the bundles of this protein then form rigid , parallel lines , sometimes gluing layers of tendon and tissue together to form lumps			0
damage to the epidermis ( the top layer of skin ) can also affect the keratinocytes - cells that create healthy skin - and the melanocytes , which produce the pigment responsible for skin colour			1
' most scars improve by themselves over time , so it can be worth waiting a few months to a year before embarking on treatments , ' says dr @entity109 , consultant dermatologist at the @entity110 at @entity111 @entity112 and the @entity113 in @entity114			2
' options for treating severe scarring include excising or cutting out the scar to renew it and replacing it with a matrix - essentially substances that contain collagen and allow new tissues to grow through them to fill the depth of a burn scar - but this can create more scarring			0
' laser treatment can help reduce the redness in fresh scars , perhaps by reducing the blood vessels , and in some instances help flatten raised scars			2
' new technology called @entity135 sprays the affected area with healthy skin cells , stimulating the growth of new , vibrant skin chemical peels can also be used for acne scars , stripping away the damaged layer of skin , which the body replaces with healthy skin			1
with severe burns , doctors repair the damaged area with a skin graft			2
however , the cosmetic results can be variable and the grafts can shrink over time			0
but with a new technology , known as @entity135 , a sliver of healthy skin is removed under local anaesthetic			1
the active cells are scraped off and placed in the @entity135 kit , which uses an enzyme to break down the healthy skin so that it can be suspended in a solution			1
with a syringe , this is then sprayed over the site of the injury , where the cells are stimulated to replicate and create healthy , new skin that can cover an area up to 80 times the size of the donor patch			1
@entity135 allows for rapid healing by providing the right mix of cells for it to happen			1
one study , published in the journal @entity174 , which compared @entity135 and skin grafting for partial - thickness burns ( where the epidermis and dermis are damaged ) found similar results for both methods			1
although skin grafting was quicker , it caused more pain in the area where the grafting patch was taken from and was more invasive , said the researchers			0
a trial is to start at @entity187 in @entity188 using @entity135 to treat leg ulcers			2
@entity0 had the treatment in august 2011			0
' after years of not feeling my best , i finally feel happy with my body again			0
i 'm amazed such a painless treatment could make such a difference			0
' first , she was given a local anaesthetic in her thigh and then , using a scalpel , the surgeon removed a postage - stamp sized patch , about 1 - 2mm thick			0
healthy skin cells were scraped off the patch and made into a solution			1
the surgeon then lasered the damaged scar tissue , and put the solution of healthy skin cells across the long scar , before covering the area with a light dressing			1
when @entity0 's dressing came off a week after the treatment , a thin layer of healthy skin was growing			1
over the next year , it thickened gradually			0
as she recalls : ' the scar was changing day by day			0
it was less lumpy , and instead of being angry and red it was fading , and it looked almost like my normal skin - just a tad darker			2
' within 12 months it was barely visible , and the following year , @entity0 wore a bikini on holiday			0
' after years of not feeling my best , i finally feel happy with my body again			0
i 'm amazed such a painless treatment could make such a difference			0
' as @entity228 , a cosmetic surgeon at the @entity229 where @entity0 had the treatment , explains : ' @entity135 is very exciting because it means we can create new healthy skin			1
it can be done immediately , and is more cost effective than other methods			2
' furthermore , those with severe burns need treatment immediately and there is a delay in transporting skin from labs			1
' when the skin comes from another person , there is a risk of rejection			0
and over time , a skin graft will contract as a person grows , whereas @entity135 cells divide and grow with the body			1
' @entity135 is currently being used on the @entity251 for burns at centres including @entity254 and @entity255 in @entity256			1
it is also available privately for other conditions .			0

new treatment @entity135 sprays healthy skin cells over the site of injury
this stimulates the creation of new , vibrant skin
it 's a quick and cost - effective method of addressing burns and scars
