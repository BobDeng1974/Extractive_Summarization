by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 11:28 est , 8 august 2012 updated : 21:20 est , 8 august 2012 @entity2 fired an employee over the cost of treating his daughter 's terminal cancer with company health care coverage , according to a lawsuit filed last week			1
@entity11 , a former mortgage broker , was sacked by @entity14 ’s fourth - largest bank in august 2010			1
his dismissal came three days before surgeons were set to operate on his daughter @entity17 in a last - ditch bid to save her life			0
the lawsuit claims @entity17 ’s operation was cancelled because she was no longer covered by @entity2 ’s employee health insurance			2
mr @entity11 ’s daughter died in march 2011			1
shocking : @entity11 claims in a new lawsuit that he was fired from his post at mega-bank @entity2 over the exorbitant cost of his daughter 's cancer treatments under the company health care plan			1
mr. @entity11 's lawsuit was filed last thursday at the @entity33 , @entity34			0
the suit does n't link mr. @entity11 's ouster - and his policy 's cancellation - to his daughter 's demise , as a @entity41 charity subsequently spotted him a year 's health coverage under @entity43 , a lawyer for mr @entity11 reportedly said			1
but certain statements allegedly made by @entity2 personnel , as well as those on the part of @entity50 reps , just prior to mr. @entity11 's dismissal , cast the bank 's acts in something of a suspicious light			1
around the time of mr. @entity11 's ouster , @entity2 and @entity50 reps asked his wife ‘ numerous questions ’ about her daughter ’s treatment and made ‘ several references … to the cost of her treatment , ’ the lawsuit states			2
also , around the same time as these cagey comments , mr. @entity11 's @entity2 supervisor alighted on something of a witch hunt , the suit alleges , searching for reasons to fire the beleaguered employee			2
@entity11 , a mortgage broker for the mega bank , was canned three days before a costly , scheduled operation to stave off @entity17 's cancer ' this was a loss of an innocent child 's life , ' the @entity78 has quoted @entity83 as saying			1
@entity83 is acting as an attorney for mr. @entity11			0
' there were [ some ] @entity2 employees who not only lacked compassion , but seemed to have been motivated by entirely improper concerns about finances , ' mr. @entity83 reportedly added of the suit			0
however , @entity2 strongly denied the the startling allegations laid out in mr. @entity11 's legal action			2
' while we 're very sympathetic to mr @entity11 for his personal loss , ' a @entity2 spokesman wrote in a statement , ' his termination was unrelated to the allegations included in the lawsuit			2
' we intend to vigorously defend the matter in court			0
we support and value our team members and our employment practices are in alignment with that focus			0
' according to the lawsuit , @entity2 claimed mr. @entity11 was fired because he allegedly handed in falsified time records			2
mr. @entity11 countered that allegation , claiming in court documents that his manager inputted his time sheets into the company system , and told him he could always recollect payment for the extra hours he worked			0
doctors diagnosed @entity17 with cancer in december 2008 , and in order to assist with her treatment , mr. @entity11 started working in different locations			0
pulling the plug : the procedure to fight @entity123 's cancer was canceled , but a charity stepped in and paid for @entity11 's @entity43 coverage			1
his daughter died seven months later in march 2011 the lawsuit also states that @entity2 failed to give mr. @entity11 information about how to continue his family 's life insurance coverage - information he says he was promised after he was fired			1
the insurance plan , which included life insurance for his children , was consequently cancelled after he left the company			0
it meant that when @entity17 died , mr. @entity11 was unable to receive life insurance compensation			0
@entity2 , which logged some $ 16 billion in profit in 2011 , denies the link between @entity11 's ouster and cost of @entity17 's treatments			1
it has vowed to fight the suit while an employee who loses their job is permitted to extend health insurance coverage under the @entity43 law as long as they continue paying the full premium , it took more than 90 days for @entity2 to send @entity11 information about how to extend his policy			1
mr. @entity11 began working for @entity153 in 2007			0
the company was bought by @entity2 in 2008 amidst the @entity14 banking crisis			0
he is now employed by @entity156 for less pay , according to the lawsuit			0
the suit also says @entity156 is not letting @entity11 sell securities because of the reasons that @entity2 gave for firing him			2
as for @entity2 , the company logged nearly $ 16 billion in net profits - and recorded almost $ 90 billion in total revenue - in 2011 , the same year little @entity17 died .			1

@entity11 , a mortgage broker , fired three days before his daughter @entity123 had a costly cancer operation
the operation was canceled before a charity came to the *rescue*
@entity174 died in march 2011
@entity2 *shareholders* split $ 16bn in profits last year
bank denies allegations that dismissal *correlated* to health care costs
