@entity0 is on course to feature in the first half of @entity5 's @entity4 title defence , according to boss @entity6			1
the 27 - year - old flanker is primed to end 14 months of injury woes by featuring for the @entity9 against @entity10 on friday night			1
@entity0 has endured two bouts of surgery on the same shoulder since his last @entity15 action , in @entity5 's 24 - 22 @entity17 defeat in november 2013			1
@entity0 ( left ) has been out of action for 14 months but is set to play for the @entity9 on friday the bullish @entity19 and @entity20 could now make his long - awaited full test return in either @entity5 's second - round clash with @entity23 or their march 1 showdown with @entity10			1
' @entity0 trained fully on tuesday to be honest , ' said head coach @entity6 , as @entity5 prepare to open their campaign in @entity26 on february 7			1
' so we 'd be hopeful that he 'd be involved in the first half of the @entity4			0
' @entity5 boss @entity6 ( right ) is confident that @entity0 will be able to feature in @entity5 's @entity31 defence @entity0 's club @entity32 believe the combative loose forward could feature in @entity35 action against @entity36 on february 15			1
@entity5 host @entity23 in @entity38 on saturday , february 14 , so if @entity0 is embroiled in club action that weekend , his @entity15 return would then come against @entity10			2
@entity6 's @entity5 side entertain @entity10 in @entity38 when this year 's @entity4 reaches its midway point , and @entity0 's return would prove a tangible mid-tournament boost			1
@entity6 's @entity5 travel to @entity46 to play @entity26 in their first game of the @entity4 on february 7 loosehead prop @entity48 has been battling hamstring problems since september , and is another aiming to return to the test arena during the upcoming competition			1
@entity6 still believes @entity48 will feature during the tournament , but sounded a note of caution in respect of the destructive ball - carrying front - rower			2
@entity6 vowed not to take any risks with his crop of stars working their way back to fitness , especially in @entity63 year			0
loosehead prop @entity48 is another player who @entity5 are hoping will be involved in the competition ' we 're still hopeful that @entity48 may have an involvement as well , ' said @entity6			2
' @entity48 looks in great shape ; he 's just got to hit a few markers to finish off his full recovery			0
' because one thing we do n't want to do is to have someone reinjure themselves and therefore put themselves out for an extended period of time			0
' so we 're very much @entity4 - focused but it 's a massive year , and what we ca n't afford to do is worsen a situation for a player with an injury			0
' @entity6 moved to allay fears surrounding the severity of scrum - half @entity83 's neck problem , tipping the @entity85 half back to recover in time to face the @entity87			2
@entity83 has disc trouble in his neck , but @entity6 believes this has been caused by bruising and swelling : if both subside in time , the @entity91 playmaker should be ready to start the tournament			0
' @entity83 is feeling really good , we 're quietly confident , ' said @entity6			0
' he 's got a few more things to tick off and he will be scanned again by the end of the week			0
@entity83 is set for a scan this week but @entity6 is confident that @entity85 scrum half will feature ' and by monday we 'd like to have a clear picture so we can have uninterrupted preparation for @entity26 , but at the moment we 're hopeful he 'll be okay			1
' if you get bruising , bruising causes swelling , and swelling causes discomfort			0
' that 's a layman 's view of what @entity83 has got presently , so we 're hopeful that will dissipate , and has dissipated over a period of time since it first happened			0

@entity0 on course to play a part in @entity5 's @entity115 defence
the flanker has been out injured with a shoulder injury for 14 months but is set to feature for the @entity9 against @entity10 on friday
@entity5 's boss @entity6 is also hopeful @entity48 will be passed fit
