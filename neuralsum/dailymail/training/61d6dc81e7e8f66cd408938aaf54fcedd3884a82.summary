@entity0 watched his @entity2 side open up a ' very pleasing ' three - point gap over @entity4 at the top of the @entity6 with a 1 - 0 win over @entity8 in @entity9 on saturday then immediately turned his attention to his first game against @entity12			1
the hoops also have a game in hand over the @entity4 and are in fine fettle ahead of the @entity17 semi-final at @entity19 next sunday afternoon after securing their fourth successive win			1
it was @entity23 ' deflected strike early in the second - half which gave the visitors a narrow but deserved win over the league 's bottom side and continued the debate about whether or not the 31 - year - old midfielder should be offered a two - year extension to his current deal which ends in the summer , instead of the one year on the table			1
@entity2 's @entity23 ( right ) beats @entity8 keeper @entity33 ( left ) but fails to hit the net the @entity36 boss , as he has done all along , insisted that he wants the player to sign a new contract but what is more certain is that @entity2 will face @entity12 for the first time since april , 2012			1
the beleaguered @entity42 club are trying to make their way through the leagues after re-emerging in the bottom tier of @entity47 football following their descent into administration and liquidation , and will go into the match with caretaker boss @entity52 having signalled his intention to leave against the backdrop of a boardroom battle and continuing cash concerns			0
@entity0 is concentrating only on his own club but recognised the magnitude of the match			0
@entity2 's @entity23 celebrates his goal with teammates during the @entity6 match ' i really look forward to it and i think we are in good place now , ' said the @entity66			1
' we know it 's a big game for many reasons			1
' all around the match there 's going to be atmosphere and history			2
it 's going to be a different challenge			2
if we perform at our very best then it is very hard to beat us			0
it 's up to us			2
' life at the other end of the table is proving less exciting for struggling @entity8 who have gone 10 games without a win			2
@entity2 manager @entity0 celebrates going three points clear at the top of the @entity85 manager @entity86 could take some solace from the fact that relegation rivals @entity89 and @entity91 also lost			1
the @entity8 remain four points behind second - bottom buddies , whom they lost 2 - 1 to in @entity9 last week , albeit the @entity93 club have played two games less			0
@entity99 tried to look for positives from the display against @entity2			1
he said : ' we did n't do things right against @entity89 last weekend and we showed the right reaction			0
' our previous two home performances had been poor so it was important that we gave our fans some encouragement			0
' we did that and our energy levels were excellent			0
' @entity112 sees his shot blocked by the @entity8 defence during the 1 - 0 victory in @entity9			0

@entity23 goal secured all three points for @entity119 's @entity2
the @entity121 also have a game in hand over second placed @entity4
@entity2 face @entity12 next sunday looking for their fifth win on the trot
@entity129 looking forward to historical and atmospheric game at @entity19
