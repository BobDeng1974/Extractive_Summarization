@entity8 said the corporation has questions to answer over claims that senior figures were aware of allegations against the entertainer as far back as the 70s			2
the mp for @entity17 said the claims raised concerns about the ‘ culture , practice and ethics ’ of the @entity5 – and argued that meant @entity3 should look at the organisation as part of his inquiry into media ethics			1
@entity2 mp @entity8 ( left ) has written to @entity3 ( right ) to ask him to investigate the @entity5 's conduct over the @entity7 affair despite the increasing number of claims that @entity7 abused underage girls on @entity5 premises , the corporation insists it has no records of complaints against him			2
but earlier this week @entity36 , who worked as a @entity5 press officer in the 70s , said the corporation was ‘ certainly ’ aware of the allegations			0
the editor of the @entity5 ’s flagship news programme @entity43 has also been criticised for pulling an investigation into the abuse claims			1
in a letter to @entity3 , mrs @entity8 said the allegations of a @entity5 culture of silence were ‘ very serious ’ and ‘ at , the very least , of the same gravity levelled at some newspaper groups about which your inquiry has heard extensive and lengthy evidence ’			1
despite the increasing number of claims that the @entity57 'll fix it star abused underage girls on @entity5 premises , the corporation insists it has no records of complaints against him she went on : ‘ given that your inquiry ’s remit also covers the @entity66 ’s broadcasters , i have concerns that the public would find it incomprehensible that such serious allegations have only been looked at internally by the @entity5			0
‘ your inquiry has heard from many that statutory regulation should be imposed upon the press			0
' however , it begs the question over the impact that statutory regulation has had on the @entity5			0
’ she added : ‘ given the huge public interest about the “ culture , practice and ethics ” of the national broadcaster , and that your inquiry is not yet concluded , i believe it would be timely and relevant , and within remit , to incorporate an investigation into the handling and reporting of numerous allegations , some of which are still coming forward into the public domain			1
