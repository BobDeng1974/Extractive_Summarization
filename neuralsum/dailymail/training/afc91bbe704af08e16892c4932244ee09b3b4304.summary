but the @entity7 final between @entity8 and @entity9 was altogether more modest affair by the looks of it			1
the @entity14 player @entity8 even turned up wearing a fur coat			1
it must have brought her some good luck - she went on to win 6 - 2 , 6 - 0			0
the image is part of a collection of rare and unseen photographs from the early days of the world 's most famous tennis tournament			1
@entity24 hit : the finalists @entity8 of @entity14 ( right ) and @entity9 of the @entity26 ( left ) line up before the big match in action : @entity14 player @entity8 went on to win the women 's singles final in 1922			1
outfits in the ladies ' game have got somewhat racier since then entertaining : @entity8 shows the players were just as athletic and competitive fair play : @entity38 tennis players @entity36 and @entity39 hold up their mascots before their men 's singles semi-final			1
@entity36 went on to win the title they are included in a new book by coach @entity45 about the life of @entity47 , the man who moved the tournament to its present location in @entity50			1
although @entity52 had already been going for more than 40 years by 1922 , it was a significant year as it was the first time it had been played on @entity55			1
huge crowds can be seen queuing patiently to get in , many dressed up in their best attire for the day out			0
one image shows fans milling about between courts , most sporting the fashionable hats and dresses of the time			0
@entity38 tennis players @entity36 and @entity39 are pictured smiling broadly before their semi-final math. @entity36 went on to win the @entity65 title , defeating his compatriot @entity66 6 - 3 , 6 - 4 , 6 - 2			0
and another photo captures the familiar sight of groundsmen rushing on to @entity70 to pull on the covers as rain stops play once again			0
fans are also pictured waiting patiently under umbrellas for it to stop			0

he won @entity101 doubles gold at the @entity103 in 1908 and helped found the @entity104 , wresting power over the game from the @entity107			0
fast forward to 2013 and the outfits may have got a little racier , and the tennis a lot faster , but the inclement @entity112 weather still has the ability to play havoc with the tournament schedule			2
thankfully the forecast for this year 's tournament , which starts on monday , looks positive with dry and sunny weather expected for much of the week			2
@entity112 's @entity119 will be hoping to go one better after losing in last year 's final to @entity120			2
and the @entity121 will be upbeat after winning @entity122 's last week and a draw which means he will avoid @entity125 in the quarter - finals			2
