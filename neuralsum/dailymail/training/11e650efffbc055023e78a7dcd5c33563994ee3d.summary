a greyhound which may be the ' fastest in the world ' after it smashed a @entity3 track record to win its first race start has been retired to stud because he can earn more money off the track			1
@entity8 , still a year off his maximum potential racing speed , took an amazing 22 - length lead to win @entity11 at @entity12 on april 6			1
afterwards , an @entity14 syndicate offered owner @entity15 $ 700,000			1
then he knocked back $ 1m - which may have been from @entity18 investors - after consulting with his family and deciding to retire @entity8 to stud			1
meanwhile , mr @entity15 lives in a humble fibro house while the prized greyhound and his mother live in a comfortable brick kennel			1
' it was a thrill because he scored the most prestigious win in the country on one of the hardest tracks in the world and he did n't beat the record , he smashed it , ' @entity25 , a third generation greyhound trainer , told the @entity34			1
you ca n't just sit around hoping that every day you can feed your family			0
' he just might earn more at stud , so it 's worth taking the risk			2
if you did n't take risks you would n't be in the game and that 's in my blood			0
' @entity8 has champion bloodlines which go back four generations to a dog called @entity74 , which belonged to @entity25 's father			1
@entity25 , 32 , lives in an old fibro house at @entity77 , near @entity78 in @entity41 with his wife , @entity80 , and three young children , @entity54 , @entity82 and @entity83			1
his 20 dogs live in a heated , double brick kennel on the property			0
early lead : it soons becomes obvious that @entity8 , not yet a two - year - old , is blitzing the field in @entity11 blitzing it : there 's no catching @entity8 as he rounds a corner and his lead stretches even further coming into the straight : with only a few metres of the 520m race to go , @entity8 has all but beaten the bunny , winning by a thumping 22 lengths over next place @entity99 , @entity100 coming a poor third when their elder son @entity54 was born , the @entity102 received an $ 1800 federal government baby bonus , which they used to buy semen through a stud service to produce a female dog , @entity50 , @entity8 's mother			1
@entity50 won several races at @entity12 before being mated with another fast greyhound , collision			2

' as he got older , he got faster and faster , ' @entity25 said			0
' he had his performance trial at @entity114 in march and he broke the trial record there			0
' @entity12 is a hard track because of its configuration and sharp corners			0
the @entity14 track record over 515m is 29:30			0
@entity12 is 520m and he did 29:07			0
' @entity8 's maiden performance , which had race callers repeating the result in wonder , made world headlines in greyhound news			2
' some of the fastest dogs in the world come from @entity14 and every other country wants @entity14 dogs , particularly the @entity18 , ' @entity25 said			1
' the @entity18 , they love it			0
they are massive punters of greyhounds and run dogs two out on private tracks over there , but keeping the family bloodline going here is sentimental to me			0
' @entity25 visits @entity8 at the @entity141 on the @entity41 @entity142 , where the black dog is allowed to service 216 bitches a year , each with an ' introductory ' fee of $ 1650			1
the figure may double within 12 months , earning him more than $ 700,000 annually			2
if the dog had continued to race , @entity25 estimates he might have broken ten track records and scored 20 wins out of as many starts			2
' but you 've got to think of the future , ' he said , ' i 've now got to find another dog and do the same thing			0
