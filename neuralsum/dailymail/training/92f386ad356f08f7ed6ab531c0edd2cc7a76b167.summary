appearing on the cover of @entity2 , @entity0 looks coy , half - smiling , half - surprised , gracefully clutching his suit jacket slung over his shoulder			1
it might appear to be some sort of watch advertisement were it not for @entity10 's blazing headline ' @entity11 , @entity0 : why we need a new president			1
' the article sizes him up on his economic and foreign relations accomplishments , as well as announces the rise of his apparent new nemesis : @entity19			1
@entity20 : @entity2 's cover might appear to be some sort of watch advertisement were it not for @entity10 's blazing headline ' @entity25 , @entity0 : why we need a new president ' @entity10 , a @entity28 professor of history at @entity30 , relies heavily on the idea of promises to lampoon @entity0 into submission - a surprising argument for the historically liberal , and pro-obama publication			1
it is urgent , he argues , to lose the rhetoric and spring for reform			2
' i was a good loser four years ago , ' he writes			1
as a ' full disclosure ' adviser to @entity42 , his sentiments are hardly surprising , but he does not rely on opinion to make his case			1
drawing heavily on unemployment numbers , stagnant growth on the economy and expert dissatisfaction , he presents mr @entity0 as a lame duck			1
' it is five years since the financial crisis began , but the central problems — excessive financial concentration and excessive financial leverage — have not been addressed , ' mr @entity10 writes			2
but more than just his policies are the problem , mr @entity10 says , it 's his decision making abilities			2
campaign : campaign : the article reads like a report card for the current @entity64 stop : drawing heavily on unemployment numbers , stagnant growth on the economy and expert dissatisfaction , he presents mr @entity0 as a lame duck ' after the imperial presidency of the @entity74 era , there was something more like parliamentary government in the first two years of @entity0 ’s administration , ' mr @entity10 writes			1
' the president proposed ; @entity79 disposed			0
' ' the voters now face a stark choice , ' mr @entity10 says			0
' they can let @entity0 ’s rambling , solipsistic narrative continue until they find themselves living in some @entity86 version of @entity87 , with low growth , high unemployment , even higher debt — and real geopolitical decline			1
' the nail in the coffin will be @entity19 , mr @entity10 argues			1
the two met in 2010 at a fundraising dinner			0
competition : it is urgent , the writer argues , to lose the rhetoric and spring for reform ' @entity19 blew me away			1
i have wanted to see him in the @entity102 ever since , ' mr @entity10 writes			0
while mr @entity19 possesses the charm that mr @entity0 once mastered , @entity103 harnesses the private sector experience , and leadership , that mr @entity0 has always lacked			1
' now @entity0 is going head - to - head with his nemesis : a politician who believes more in content than in form , more in reform than in rhetoric , ' mr @entity10 writes			1
his analysis is not without controversy , however , as @entity117 columnist @entity116 has called him out on an error			2
reception : the public reception of the cover has been hot and cold no thanks : some readers announced their allegiance to @entity2 , while other readers pronouncing their disdain reverse : still , other readers thought the controversial cover might be a boost for @entity0 ' there are multiple errors and misrepresentations in @entity10 ’s cover story in @entity2 — i guess they do n’t do fact - checking , ' mr @entity116 writes on his blog			1
he refers to this passage of the piece : ' the president pledged that health - care reform would not add a cent to the deficit			2
but the @entity145 and the @entity146 now estimate that the insurance - coverage provisions of the @entity148 will have a net cost of close to $ 1.2 trillion over the 2012 – 22 period			2
' and then declares : ' readers are no doubt meant to interpret this as saying that @entity145 found that the @entity153 will increase the deficit			0
but anyone who actually read , or even skimmed , the @entity145 report ( pdf ) knows that it found that the @entity148 would reduce , not increase , the deficit — because the insurance subsidies were fully paid for			0
' he calls on @entity2 to correct the ' plain misrepresentation of the facts			2
' @entity163 called out editor @entity164 for the gaffe			0
' @entity164 certainly swings for the fences , ' they write			0
' she just puts a little too much pine tar on the bat			0
' spice : since @entity164 took the helm of the floundering publication , she has made it her mission to spice up the covers with controversial images of bondage or a heavily photoshopped princess @entity179 since mrs @entity164 took the helm of the floundering publication , she has made it her mission to spice up the covers with controversial images of bondage or a heavily photoshopped princess @entity179			0
the public reception of this cover has been hot and cold , with some readers announcing their allegiance to @entity2 , while others pronouncing their disdain			0
the paper created the hashtag # @entity190 to keep track of the discussion			0
' i will never ever purchase another @ @entity2 # @entity190 thank you @ nfergus # @entity197 , ' tweeted one reader			0
' chronic unemployment , stagnant economic growth , unsustainable deficits , no plan			0
yes , it 's time to # @entity190 , ' wrote another			2
still , some readers thought the cover was just another attempt at stirring the pot - in the @entity64 's favor			1
' # @entity209 to burst anyone 's bubble , ' one reader wrote , ' but @entity2 might be trying the old reverse psychology			2
trash @entity213 , to energize his base			0
' after all , it was not so long ago that the same magazine proclaimed @entity103 was ' too insecure ' to be president			1
the now iconic image that graces this cover of @entity2 was taken by @entity221 photographer @entity220			2
taken on august 12 , the image is one in a series of nine of the president walking on a lush green street with secret service trailing him close behind			0
he seems at ease , happy , as if he is surrounded by good friends			0
the captain reads : ' president @entity0 speaks to media as he walks through his @entity235 neighborhood to a campaign event , sunday , aug. 12 , 2012 , in @entity237			1
' this disarmed appearance is critical to the cover image , which almost comes off as a sneak attack on the @entity64			0
at least they had the dignity to remove the gum he was chewing			0
the divorce between the president 's light demeanor and the damning text makes the cover - and the image - all the more interesting			1
some might recognize mrs @entity220 as the same photographer who snapped the image of @entity0 in @entity254 's @entity253 last week			1
speaking from a podium , he gestured his hands in such a way that he seems to be grasping the sun , or rather , a crystal ball			0
vision : some might recognize mrs @entity220 as the same photographer who snapped the image of @entity0 in @entity254 's @entity253 last week			1

@entity28 writer - who worked for @entity42 in 2008 - bashes @entity0 's years of ' failed ' policy
calls for new era of @entity103 / @entity19
magazine *courts* controversy again , leaning right instead of left
