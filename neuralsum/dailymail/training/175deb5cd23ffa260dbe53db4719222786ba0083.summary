by @entity0 published : 18:17 est , 23 january 2013 updated : 03:47 est , 24 january 2013 @entity1 pulled off the seemingly impossible last night with his historic @entity3 referendum pledge			1
it not only united @entity7 @entity6 big beasts and @entity9 ’s business leaders , but even won the support of @entity12 ’s @entity11			1
he sent shockwaves through @entity15 as he declared @entity9 rejects ‘ ever closer union ’ , the founding principle of the @entity3 , and gave a guarantee of an in / out vote on our membership if he is prime minister after 2015			1
’ he has set himself the herculean task of persuading other @entity3 leaders and @entity28 eurocrats to back his calls for reform against strong opposition from the likes of @entity42 and @entity43			2
though he said renegotiation would not begin until the next @entity45 , he will now come under pressure to spell out more precisely his repatriation demands			0
mr @entity1 insisted that a referendum to be held by the end of 2017 would be a deal - breaker in any future coalition agreement with the @entity52			1
while it had been trailed for months , the prime minister ’s announcement left @entity55 in chaos as @entity57 told @entity58 he did not want an in / out referendum , only for other senior figures to insist later that he might			1
labour leader @entity57 made it clear that he did not want a referendum - despite some members of his party suggesting they might want one in direct contradiction of his leader , shadow foreign secretary @entity67 said : ‘ never say never			0
’ and another @entity55 frontbencher , @entity68 , said of mr @entity57 ’s statement : ‘ this is our position today			0
’ in a sign of potential tension within the @entity75 , however , deputy prime minister @entity72 said ‘ years of uncertainty ’ caused by a future referendum would hit jobs and growth and this ‘ was not in the national interest ’			2
but work and pensions secretary @entity82 , the @entity83 ’s @entity7 standard - bearer , told the @entity84 that mr @entity1 ’s long - awaited speech on @entity9 ’s future in @entity15 was ‘ bloody marvellous ’			1
‘ this is a seismic moment , ’ he said			0
‘ the prime minister shows real leadership compared to @entity57 , who has now confirmed that come the election @entity55 will campaign against a referendum and against giving people a choice			2
‘ if you want a referendum , you have to vote @entity6			0
if you do n’t want one , you vote @entity55			0
’ @entity11 opened the door to negotiation @entity99 said the prime minister was ' bang on ' @entity101 said the @entity3 needed reform in an article for the @entity84 , former defence secretary @entity103 – another leading light among @entity105 – says conservative mps have ‘ waited a long time ’ for a prime minister to deliver such a ‘ hugely significant message ’ and promise the @entity9 people ‘ a definitive choice through a referendum ’			1
mr @entity1 ’s speech was hailed as ‘ bang on ’ by @entity116 mayor @entity99 , who had ‘ no doubt ’ the @entity9 people would vote for the kind of renegotiated membership the prime minister envisaged			1
‘ what most sensible people want is to belong to the single market but to lop off the irritating excrescences of the @entity3 , ’ he said			0
he added : ‘ there are a lot of other countries around that want to see reform			0
i think it ’s going to be much simpler than people expect to get a better deal			0
’ conservatives @entity103 and @entity82 both hailed the prime minister 's ' hugely significant speech ' @entity134 was delighted and surprised as @entity11 , @entity15 ’s most powerful figure , responded to mr @entity1 ’s speech by opening the door to a renegotiation of @entity9 ’s membership terms			1
‘ @entity12 , and i personally , want @entity9 to be an important part and an active member of the @entity3 , ’ she said			2
‘ we are prepared to talk about @entity9 wishes but we must always bear in mind that other countries have different wishes and we must find a fair compromise			0
we will talk intensively with @entity9 about its individual ideas			0
’ the public remains deeply divided over whether @entity9 should quit the @entity3 , according to recent polls			2
but the latest surveys suggest that support for leaving has faded as the debate over the issue has intensified			0
a @entity157 survey at the weekend found that 40 per cent of people would now vote to stay in the @entity3 compared to 34 per cent wanting to quit – the first time since the 2010 election that most have said @entity9 should not leave			1
as recently as november , 51 per cent said they wanted to quit and just 30 per cent wanted to stay in			0
by contrast , @entity43 insisted the @entity3 ‘ only wants willing members ’ , while @entity163 offered to ‘ roll out the red carpet ’ for businessmen it claimed would lead an exodus to its shores if @entity9 left the @entity3			1
@entity163 foreign minister @entity170 told mr @entity1 : ‘ you ca n’t do @entity172 ... to take an example which our @entity9 friends will understand , imagine @entity15 is a football club and you join ; once you ’re in it you ca n’t say , “ @entity178 ”			1
’ but @entity9 ’s leading business groups backed the prime minister ’s stance , while 55 business chiefs – including the heads of the @entity184 , @entity185 and @entity186 – signed a supportive joint letter			1
@entity101 , director general of the employers ’ group the @entity188 , agreed with mr @entity1 that ‘ closer union of the eurozone is not for us ’ , and said the prime minister ‘ rightly recognises the benefits of retaining membership of what must be a reformed @entity3 ’			1
mr @entity1 , who was forced to postpone his speech last week because of the @entity199 hostage crisis , set out a hugely ambitious vision of a transformed @entity3			1
casting himself as a modern - day heretic , he said ‘ nothing ’ would be off the table when he presents demands for the repatriation of a swathe of powers if he wins the 2015 election			0
he cited @entity3 regulations on employment , the environment , social affairs and crime as among ‘ so many areas ’ where he wanted to ‘ examine whether the balance is right ’			0
he suggested the ‘ principal reason ’ for @entity9 ’s membership of the @entity3 was ‘ our participation in the single market and our ability to help set its rules ’ – suggesting he wants a return to something like the @entity219 joined in 1975			1
he said he wanted to challenge the central tenet of the @entity3 – the commitment in the founding @entity229 in 1957 to create an ‘ ever closer union ’			2
‘ we understand and respect the right of others to maintain their commitment to this goal			0
but for @entity9 – and perhaps for others – it is not the objective			0
' and we would be much more comfortable if the treaty specifically said so , freeing those who want to go further , faster , to do so , without being held back by the others , ’ mr @entity1 said			2
he said he wanted a new @entity3 treaty , saying he believed one would be necessary to create the closer economic and political union for eurozone countries fighting to save the single currency			0
but he insisted that even if negotiations were opened , he would be prepared to follow the example of @entity247 , who asked for changes to @entity9 ’s membership terms outside a treaty ahead of the 1975 referendum			1
he said his aim was to ensure @entity9 remains a member of a more ‘ open and flexible ’ @entity3 , saying even if @entity9 left it would remain ‘ for many years our biggest market , and forever our geographical neighbourhood ’			1
but in a warning directed firmly at mrs @entity11 , he said the @entity3 would be ‘ greatly diminished ’ by a @entity9 exit			1
‘ an @entity3 without @entity9 , without one of @entity15 ’s strongest powers , a country which in many ways invented the single market , and which brings real heft to @entity15 ’s influence on the world stage , which plays by the rules and which is a force for liberal economic reform , would be a very different kind of @entity3 , ’ he added			2
mr @entity1 was unclear about whether he would campaign in favour of a no vote in his referendum if he failed to secure his demands			2
‘ who goes into a negotiation hoping and expecting to fail ? that is not the approach i take , ’ he said			0
former @entity52 leader @entity277 said he could not envisage his party agreeing to a referendum if the @entity6 failed to win a majority at the next election and wanted to form another coalition .			0

@entity43 insisted the @entity3 ' only wants willing members ' , while @entity163 said businessmen would lead an exodus to its shores if @entity9 left the @entity3
