by @entity0 foreign visitors and short - term migrants cost the @entity3 £ 2billion a year , an official report warns today			1
the first comprehensive assessment of ‘ health tourism ’ says the true cost to taxpayers is up to 100 times bigger than some estimates			1
it concluded the @entity11 has ‘ some of the most generous rules in the world ’			1
and it even found evidence of relatives of migrants taking advantage of visits to @entity20 to have free treatment			1
costly : a report estimated the health tourism costs the @entity3 up to £ 2billion a year the bill was put at between £ 1.9billion and £ 2billion – with only around 16 per cent of the money clawed back			1
the government said it would be ‘ impractical or inappropriate ’ to charge in full some patients , such as students or those with infectious diseases			0
however health secretary @entity31 hopes to recover up to £ 500million a year , arguing @entity20 can not afford an ‘ international health service ’			1
the study estimates that £ 388million goes on foreign patients who should pay for their care but are never charged			1
health tourists – those who specifically travel to the @entity20 for treatment – cost up to £ 300million more			1
the @entity38 plans a new annual levy of £ 150 on foreign students and £ 200 on temporary migrants			1
the surcharge is expected to generate £ 200million			0
extra strain : according to professor @entity45 , the @entity3 levy will make coming to the @entity20 for treatment even more attractive angry : health secretary @entity31 vows to recover £ 500m and blasts our ' international health service ' today 's findings will prove highly controversial – and are likely to be hotly disputed by the left - wing medical establishment			1
@entity51 suggested earlier this year that the government was ‘ xenophobic ’ for proposing charges for more temporary visitors and migrants			0
the situation is complex when it comes to deciding in practice who is and who is not eligible for free @entity3 hospital treatment			1
data on migrants in the @entity20 is limited , and that which has previously been compiled is of very poor quality			2
the government admits that today ’s twin reports on the scale of the problem are , by definition , based on incomplete information and a series of assumptions and must be treated with some caution			0
the documents concede that the definition of ‘ health tourists ’ can vary widely , applying to people who come here deliberately to obtain free healthcare , and others who are simply frequent visitors who register with @entity82			2
researchers conducted telephone interviews with 36 senior officials at a cross-section of @entity3 trusts , and interviews with nine @entity89 and immigration enforcement officers based at five major airports			0
seven trusts involved the study were visited and a range of staff , from clinicians through to front line staff , were interviewed face - to - face			0
to collect data about the number of migrants and overseas visitors in a more consistent way ; a ‘ diary ’ was distributed to @entity3 staff taking part in the study inviting them to keep a record of all patients brought to their attention over a two - week period			1
mr @entity31 said : ‘ having a universal health service free at the point of use rightly makes us the envy of the world , but we must make sure the system is fair to the hardworking @entity20 taxpayers who fund it			1
‘ it ’s time for action to ensure the @entity3 is a national health service – not an international one			2
with the @entity3 already under pressure from an ageing population , it can not be right that large amounts of taxpayers ’ money is being lost through treating people who should be paying from foreign countries			2
’ ministers have appointed sir @entity133 , former chief of the @entity134 , as an adviser on ‘ visitor and migrant cost recovery ’			0
he will bring in measures to identify those who should pay and find ways of making them do so			0
estimates of the cost of ‘ health tourism ’ have varied from £ 20million to £ 200million , sparking much political controversy			1
@entity147 , of the @entity148 , insisted earlier this year : ‘ believe me , there is little evidence that health tourism is a significant burden on the @entity3			1
the £ 40million allegedly written off over the last four years by hospitals in @entity154 and @entity155 is approximately 0.01 per cent of the @entity3 budget over the period			2
’ @entity158 , then a @entity51 health spokesman , suggested charging foreigners for care was ‘ xenophobic ’ and @entity162 of the @entity163 said : ‘ it is important we do not overestimate the problem			0
’ but even if only 75 per cent of the £ 500million target is recovered , it would pay the salaries of almost 4,000 doctors			0
free care is offered to temporary visitors and students , unlike in @entity174 , where students must pay £ 50 a month			2
@entity176 charges £ 260 a year for restricted private health insurance for students			2
the @entity38 ’s @entity179 will create the powers to increase the number of migrants who will have to pay to access healthcare			2
@entity51 pointed out that the figures from the @entity186 were based on ‘ incomplete data , sometimes of varying quality , and a large number of assumptions ’			0
@entity191 , @entity192 health spokesman , said : ‘ we are in favour of improving the recovery of costs from people with no entitlement to @entity3 treatment			1
' more spin than substance ' : opposition health spokesman @entity191 dismissed today 's report ‘ but it ’s hard not to conclude that this announcement is more about spin than substance			0
the government ’s own report undermines their headline - grabbing figures , admitting they are based on old and incomplete data			0
‘ instead of grandstanding , the government need to focus on delivering practical changes			0
@entity51 would not support changes that make doctors and nurses surrogate immigration officials			0
’ earlier this year , the @entity217 highlighted a warning from a consultant of the ‘ massive and escalating problem ’ of foreigners travelling to @entity20 to exploit the @entity3			2
professor @entity45 , of the @entity223 in @entity224 , suggested in an article for the @entity226 that expectant mothers were arriving in this country just to give birth , while others are flying here for cancer , @entity235 , kidney and infertility treatment and leaving without paying			0
the government estimates that in hospitals alone fewer than 50 per cent of chargeable foreign nationals are identified .			0

previous figures estimated £ 20m to £ 200m of @entity3 funds went on tourists
but the first comprehensive report of health tourism far *exceeds* that figure and warns @entity20 has ' some of most generous rules in the world '
it estimates £ 388m goes on foreign patients *wrongly* given free treatment
a further £ 300m is used by tourists who travel to take advantage of @entity3
@entity38 plans £ 150 levy on foreign students and £ 200 on migrants
