by @entity0 a woman who started a fire which killed five people – including three children aged under five – was jailed for 30 years yesterday			1
@entity5 , 43 , set fire to a pushchair in an act of ‘ exceptional wickedness ’ because she was fed up with it being left outside her flat			1
the devastating inferno she started trapped a neighbouring couple and three young children in a first - floor flat			2
the @entity46 blaze was so intense it melted a television and cooker hood in the couple ’s first floor flat			0
as the fire took hold , mr @entity38 was heard in the background of a 999 call screaming : ‘ @entity57 , oh my @entity58 , we ’re going to die			1
’ despite being badly burned , he managed to tell police that , moments earlier , he had heard @entity5 , a mother - of - five , shouting through their letterbox : ‘ i ’m going to burn your house down			1
’ mr @entity38 and @entity41 died later in hospital			2
miss @entity36 , @entity42 and @entity43 , who were the children of miss @entity36 ’s brother @entity68 , 28 , and were sleeping over for the night , perished in a bedroom			0
@entity70 , who lived in the flat below , was convicted of five counts of murder last month			0
yesterday a judge handed down five life sentences and told her she would serve a minimum of 30 years			1
mr @entity76 said : ‘ the setting fire to the pushchair was an act of exceptional wickedness , almost unparalleled in its consequences			1
wreck : @entity5 was today sentenced to a minimum 30 years in prison ; the stairs in the house are pictured entrance : the fire was set in a hallway in the building where the family and the killer all lived ; the victims ' door is shown here heat : a photograph showing the damage to the property 's kitchen following @entity5 's drunken rampage guilty : @entity5 has been convicted of killing her neighbours by setting fire to their home ‘ for those who had to hear the evidence of the 999 calls , the horror of those moments in the flat upstairs as @entity105 and @entity38 faced the awful inevitability of their imminent deaths will be forever etched on their memories			1
’ @entity114 was told that @entity5 , who was in a difficult relationship with @entity116 , 45 , who cheated on her , was ‘ bitterly resentful ’ of @entity117 and mr @entity38 ’s happy partnership			1
she had repeatedly rowed with miss @entity36 over @entity41 ’s pushchair being left in a communal hallway of the flats , in @entity20 , @entity122 , as well as the couple making noise upstairs			0
@entity5 had also accused @entity117 of having a sexual relationship with mr @entity116 , an allegation , the court heard , for which there was ‘ no basis at all ’			2
on one occasion @entity5 , a heavy drinker , is alleged to have told miss @entity36 : ‘ i will set your house on fire with you and your kids in			1
’ seven weeks later , on october 19 last year , she carried out the threat			0
the court was read a victim impact statement from @entity140 , 29 , the mother of @entity43 and @entity42 , who said her heart had been ‘ torn apart ’ by the deaths			0
‘ when i wake up in the morning , that first minute is beautiful , ’ she said			0
‘ in those 60 seconds i feel no pain and i ’m just listening for the laughter and footsteps running across the landing in the hope that my bedroom door will fly open and they will come bouncing in , jump onto the bed so that i can smother them in kisses			0
it is then that reality sets in			0
my heart is wrenched and the heavy empty feeling engulfs me			0
poignant : this picture frame in the living room which appears to contain the word ' baby ' was melted disaster : the fire destroyed most of the building , with the furniture in the living room wrecked fury : the arson attack , leaving the stairs looking like a bomb site , stemmed from a disagreement over a pram ruin : the kitchen was almost unrecognisable despite its fire prevention measures ‘ i realise that i will never hold my children ’s hands again , teach them to ride a bike			1
the “ normal ” things a parent should be allowed to do			0
’ @entity5 denied setting the fire and even admitted when she took the stand that the killer was ‘ beyond evil ’			1
but it later emerged that she had a history of cruelty to her own children , three of whom she abandoned as toddlers			0
her ex-husband , @entity187 , 51 , said @entity5 stubbed cigarettes out on her baby son ’s forehead , hacked off her toddler daughter ’s blonde hair , scalded her with boiling water and locked her in an understairs cupboard as punishment			2
‘ she destroyed my family years ago , and by setting fire to that house she ’s ruined the lives of so many other people , ’ he said			2
that evil woman deserves to rot in hell			0
’ one of @entity5 ’s daughters , @entity205 , now 23 and a mother of one , added : ‘ it shocked me to know what she ’d done , but it ’s not out of character			1
‘ she was a mother from hell to me – and she still is			0
spending the rest of her life in prison wo n’t come close to what she deserves			2
