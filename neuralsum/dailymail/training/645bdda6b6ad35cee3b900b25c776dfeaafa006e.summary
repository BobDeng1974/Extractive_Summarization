by @entity0 published : 19:43 est , 9 may 2013 updated : 02:07 est , 10 may 2013 murders , backstreet abortions , suicides , and bomb blasts — @entity5 , aged 20 , certainly had one of the most gruesome jobs in the world			1
the details of her story are so strange that apparently we ca n't be expected to believe them all			1
murder on @entity14 presented a frustratingly toned - down rewrite of a true story — how a young crime reporter ditched journalism to work alongside the pioneer of modern detective methods during the @entity21			1
and it turned the extraordinary history of the birth of forensics into a more conventional murder mystery			1
murder on @entity14 is a new @entity28 crime drama set during the @entity21 of 1940			1
pictured is @entity30 as @entity31 and @entity32 as dr @entity33 the real @entity5 , who died in february aged 93 , spent the war working for @entity36 pathologist professor @entity35 , a man so eccentric that he liked to prop up a skeleton on a chair at the table when he had his afternoon tea			1
but he was a forensics genius , the first man to identify murder victims by strands of their clothing or their hair , and a showman , too : at one murder trial he produced the victim 's skull , the first time such evidence had been exhibited in court			1
everyone reacted with horror — except the man on trial , the victim 's husband			1
that flair and drama were missing from the tv adaptation			2
the characters were interesting — they could n't fail to be , given the originals			2
but fiction fell far short of the truth			2
the pathologist , played by @entity32 , spent a lot of time scolding gormless policemen for trampling on the evidence			2
while they took notes , a constable clattered about in the background			2
@entity75 was aghast to discover the pc had cleaned up the entire murder scene : washed the dishes , scrubbed blood off the furniture and destroyed all the evidence			1
' tidied things up a bit , have n't i ? ' the copper said proudly			2
murder on @entity14 : the characters were interesting - they could n't fail to be , given the originals			1
but fiction fell far short of the truth @entity91 : the @entity93 reveals in the original pilot , creator @entity92 envisaged mr @entity95 with a long tail with a point at the end the show did capture the dark humour of the @entity21			1
police photographer @entity103 , played by @entity104 , was deliciously sardonic : ' my mother will never be able to eat red meat again , ' she complained , as she described the aftermath of a @entity110 air raid that left ' body parts scattered all over our azaleas '			2
@entity30 , best known for @entity114 ( she was wife number five ) , had a combination of innocence and fire as @entity5 , the kind of girl who would blanche when told that a box contained a murder victim 's tongue — and then look inside anyway			1
but the story did n't convey how unconventional @entity5 really was			0
' you could spend 100 years in @entity128 's mortuaries , ' she once remarked , ' and never be bored			0
' the writers have failed utterly to capture that sense of ghoulish fascination			0
the most successful franchise in tv history was nearly a failure too , as @entity91 : the @entity93 revealed			1
in the original pilot , creator @entity92 envisaged mr @entity95 as the @entity136 — instead of pointed ears , he had a long tail with a point at the end			0
the @entity142 was boringly called the @entity143 , the commander was captain april ( played by @entity145 ) and the second - in - command was a female officer called simply ' @entity148 '			0
indeed it seems that @entity92 , a former @entity150 cop writing tv scripts in his spare time , saw all women as little more than numbers			0
when the show became a success , he boasted he had slept with every actress in every episode except two			0
but it was sheer luck that made the show a hit			0
@entity145 pulled out and the irrepressible @entity163 replaced him as @entity164			0
the storylines caught the idealistic mood of the @entity167 , and were acclaimed for showing the first ' inter-racial kiss ' between @entity164 and @entity169 , played by black actress @entity170			0
even so , @entity91 did n't become a global success until years after the original series had been cancelled			1
fans were enthralled by the science in sci - fi , from teleport beams to anti-matter warp drives			0
@entity178 , the original @entity95 , offered the best comment : ' i do n't like the idea of teleporting			0
you might scramble some atoms			0
i would n't want to be the first to try it			0
' sometimes , it seems , fiction is actually stranger than truth .			0
