next time you drag yourself out of bed and think it 's an effort to shower and grumpily start struggling to put on your clothes and do your make - up , spare a thought for @entity6			1
the 20 - year - old partially paralysed @entity8 woman has released a video revealing how she manages to get ready every day with the use of just one arm			1
ms @entity12 suffered a horrific motorcycle accident in the tunnel of @entity15 near @entity16 in march 2014 and as a result is unable to move her left arm due to brachial plexus palsy and the nerve damage it has caused			1
in the moving video posted on her @entity24 page , the footage shows how simple everyday actions have become an ordeal for her			1
' i am teaching myself every day how to support myself , how to find solutions , ' she told the @entity31			2
' i live with neuropathic pain ( unbearable ) which also suffer amputees			2
my suffering is physical as well as moral , my body is heavily damaged and tired faster than normal			0
' normally , we need five nerves to control one arm ; four nerves from my marrow have already been torn off , so they are not recoverable , and i have already undergone two surgeries , one of which was a nerve graft , ' she wrote in a description accompanying her video			1
partially paralysed @entity6 has released a video revealing how she manages to get ready every day with the use of just one arm the @entity8 woman does everything including painting her nails and putting on her watch with her right hand the 22 - year - old suffered a horrific motorcycle accident in the tunnel of @entity15 near @entity16 in march 2014 and as a result is unable to move her left arm ' when i first came back from the hospital , i remember going up to my room and bursting into tears			1
this is when i first realized what had happened to me and that my life would completely change			0
' it took me a while to recover my life rhythm , to eat again , to sleep , and to slowly reduce the doses of painkillers			0
' at first , i had a hard time doing things by myself and everything felt painful , every movement or gesture			0
i could n't find pleasure in doing anything			0
' she adds that whilst she looks to the bright side , there are moments of uncertainty : ' i am deprived of my passion but also a lot of activities , my family is worried about me and my future			0
' ' what 's been the most difficult , and still is today - all people who have paralyzed or amputated limbs will back me up on this -- is how to bear the neuropathic pain , also known as " phantom limb pain "			2
' this kind of pain is very difficult to manage and some people are completely unable to bear it			2
but there are techniques to help us relieve this pain			0
most of the times , i can manage it , so i 'm ok			0
ms @entity12 , above , lies on the bed and rolls over to do up her bra with her right hand she then shimmies the bra up her body and over her right arm , above she says : ' i am teaching myself every day how to support myself , how to find solutions , ' ' you can see in my video , for instance , the solution for my bra : one of my friends , who is able - bodied , gave it to me , because i was tired of always waiting for somebody to help me hook it up ! ' i have always hated somebody else helping me do something or doing it for me			1
' there are tons of activities i still can not do by myself			0
my single real fear about the future is for when i become a mother and i need to take care of my baby as a single - handed mother ... fortunately , i have heard from mothers suffering from plexus palsy that they generally do very well			1
' ' if i had to give advice to all the people who have suffered from injuries caused by any kind of road accident , i would tell them ' be happy and fight for your lives , ' because you still have the chance to see tomorrow , ' she says			1
' to all road drivers , remember that you are not untouchable , and the 30 seconds when i thought i was almost killed me			2
you do n't want that , so drive slowly and carefully			0
