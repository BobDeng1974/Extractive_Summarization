by @entity0 published : 06:11 est , 5 july 2013 updated : 08:16 est , 6 july 2013 the late pope @entity2 will be made a saint , the @entity1 announced today			1
the news came after @entity5 approved a second miracle attributed to the @entity8 pontif who led the @entity10 from 1978 to 2005			2
the @entity1 said pope @entity11 , who reigned from 1958 to 1963 and called the @entity12 , would also be made a saint			2
no dates for the canonisation ceremonies were immediately given			1
heeding the calls , then - pope @entity35 waived the typical five - year waiting period and allowed an investigation into @entity2 's life to begin immediately			1
the investigation determined that the beloved @entity8 - born pope lived a virtuous life , the first step in the sainthood process			2
subsequently , the @entity1 determined that a @entity45 nun who prayed for his intercession was miraculously cured of @entity48			0
a second miracle is needed for canonization			0
the @entity1 has n't divulged any details about that second purported miracle			0
the @entity54 news agency reported that a commission of cardinals and bishops met tuesday to consider @entity2 's case and signed off on it			1
a @entity1 official confirmed that the decision had been taken some time back and that tuesday 's meeting was essentially a formality			2
one possible canonization date is december 8 , the feast of the @entity66 , a major feast day for the @entity10			0
this year the feast coincidentally falls on a sunday , which is when canonizations usually occur			0
the official , who spoke on condition of anonymity because he is not authorized by the church to discuss saint - making cases on the record , confirmed reports in @entity79 newspaper that @entity2 could be canonized together with pope @entity11 , who called the @entity12 but died in 1963 before it was finished			1
there is reasoned precedent for beatifying or canonizing two popes together , primarily to balance one another out			0
@entity2 has been on the fast track for possible sainthood ever since his 2005 death , but there remains some concern that the process has been too quick			1
some of the @entity1 's deep - seated problems - clerical sex abuse , dysfunctional governance and more recently the financial scandals at the @entity1 bank - essentially date from shortcomings of his pontificate			0
@entity97 : pope @entity2 and @entity98 , who was beatified in 2003 , together in @entity99 in 1987 defenders of the fast - track process argue that people are canonized , not pontificates			1
but the @entity1 in the past has sought to balance concerns about papal saints by giving two the honor at the same time			0
such was the case in 2000 , when @entity2 beatified @entity11 , dubbed the ' good pope , ' alongside pope @entity110 , who was criticized by @entity111 for condoning the seizure of a @entity111 boy and allegedly referring to @entity111 as dogs			1
by canonizing @entity2 along with @entity11 , the @entity1 could be seeking to assuage concerns about @entity2 's fast - track sainthood case by tying it together with the 50 - year wait @entity11 has had to endure			1
spiritual leaders : pope @entity2 in 1986 in @entity118 with the @entity119 rites : pope @entity2 gives communion to a @entity123 woman in 1985 former leader of the @entity10 : @entity2 was born in @entity8 and became pope @entity2 at the age of 50 , in 1978 many @entity8 have been awaiting the final steps of @entity2 's progress , which has been pushed for by cardinal @entity128 , the @entity8 pope 's longtime private secretary			1
during @entity33 , chants of ' @entity32 ! ' or ' sainthood now ! ' erupted in @entity34			0
heeding the calls , then - pope @entity35 waived the typical five - year waiting period and allowed an investigation into @entity2 's life to begin immediately			1
the investigation determined that the beloved @entity8 - born pope lived a virtuous life , the first step in the sainthood process			2
subsequently , the @entity1 determined that a @entity45 nun who prayed for his intercession was miraculously cured of @entity48			0
a second miracle is needed for canonization			0
the @entity1 has n't divulged any details about that second purported miracle .			0
