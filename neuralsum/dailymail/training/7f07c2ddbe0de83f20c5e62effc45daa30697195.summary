a season of sensational firsts for jockey @entity2 could end in the biggest of them all at @entity4 on sunday afternoon			1
the @entity6 - born dual champion will line up for the first time in the € 5million @entity8 on 6 - 1 second favourite @entity10 confident there was an explanation for her only defeat behind @entity14 in the @entity15 in august			1
the @entity17 - supporting rider will also be buoyed by a 2014 record which has seen @entity10 provide him with wins in the @entity20 at @entity21 and the @entity22 at @entity23 on his first rides in the pair of prestigious contests			1
@entity2 has experience of riding @entity10 , pictured at @entity23 in august 2014 @entity2 leaves the weighing room at @entity23 in october 2014 @entity10 would become the first filly to win the @entity30 and @entity22 in the same season and a more than satisfactory gallop last week at @entity34 ’s @entity34 racecourse has convinced @entity2 that his @entity36 - trained mount is back in prime form			1
@entity2 said : ‘ i never like to make excuses but she was just coming into season and that is pretty big			2
when i went for her she felt as if she just faltered			0
@entity34 did her the world of good			0
she rides like a colt and is built like one			0
it has been a wonderful season — to win the @entity30 would be the perfect end			1
’ @entity4 ’s normally sparsely - populated lawns will be packed this afternoon with 60,000 spectators			2
about 5,000 @entity49 among them will be hoping their trio — just a way , @entity53 or @entity54 — can give them a first win after near - misses including second place for @entity58 for the last two years			0
the big worry for @entity2 , who landed the first @entity60 of his career at this meeting in 2010 with @entity64 ’s @entity63 in the @entity65 , is @entity10 ’s draw in wide stall 15			2
@entity68 won from there last year but she was the first to do so from a double - figure stall since @entity71 ( 14 ) in 2003			0
@entity2 , left , riding @entity72 in the @entity73 at @entity34 on september 26 , 2014 @entity2 ( right ) lost out in a photo finish in the @entity75 at @entity23 on saturday the sun shone at @entity4 yesterday and drying conditions are another negative in the argument that trainer @entity79 can turn around a disappointing season for 2013 winner @entity68			1
whether the narrow defeat by @entity83 in the @entity84 left its mark is debatable but the filly who was 2 - 1 to win back - to - back @entity88 immediately 12 months ago is now 11 - 1 after other defeats at @entity23 , when she was injured , and last month ’s @entity91			2
@entity68 is ridden by @entity92 not @entity93 , leaving the @entity94 to ride @entity97 winner @entity95			0
but @entity103 winner @entity102 , the third of the trio of runners owned by @entity101 , looks the most likely to win under @entity104 .			0

@entity2 will line up on @entity10 in the € 5million @entity8 on sunday afternoon
@entity10 has also provided @entity2 with wins in the @entity20 at @entity21 and the @entity22 at @entity23
@entity10 would become the first filly to win the @entity30 and @entity22 in the same season
