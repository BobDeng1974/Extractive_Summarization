but it seems that birds , like drivers , do have to stick to a speed limit			1
according to researchers in the @entity11 , birds must fly below a certain speed to avoid crashing into trees and other obstacles			1
if they go over the limit , it becomes more difficult to spot objects they could hit			1
and with the absence of any helpful road signs on their routes , they have to work out their safe maximum speed themselves – taking into account factors including their size and manoeuvrability , as well as how built - up the area they are flying through is			2
way forward : scientists have discovered that birds intuitively know how fast to fly - and hope to use this research to improve unmanned robots travelling through built - up areas the researchers , from the @entity39 , believe their findings could help defence experts programme unmanned drones to fly as fast as possible without crashing			1
they looked at birds such as the daredevil northern goshawk and developed mathematical models based on the way the animals travel through the air			2
study author professor @entity49 said : ‘ if birds flew at speeds purely based on what they can immediately see , they would n’t go very fast			2
’ instead , he explained , they roughly calculate the density of the environment they are flying through and set themselves a top speed based on the likelihood of finding a gap between the trees or buildings			0
above that top speed , he went on , they are ‘ sure to crash ’			0
but if they stay below it , they could theoretically remain in flight forever			0
professor @entity49 , who is currently testing his theory on pigeons , added : ‘ there is no magic number for the critical speed			0
in fact , the critical speed depends on some parameters describing tree density and size , and the bird ’s manoeuvrability and size			0
‘ in other words , if the forest is too dense , the trees are too thick , the bird is too large or flying too fast , it will eventually collide with a tree			0
’ he said that ‘ mathematical calculations ’ drawn from the way birds fly could eventually be used by scientists to increase the speed unmanned drones can safely fly at .			1
