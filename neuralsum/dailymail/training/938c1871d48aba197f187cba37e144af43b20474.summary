by @entity0 published : 13:49 est , 1 february 2013 updated : 11:36 est , 2 february 2013 thousands of home - owners blighted by the high - speed @entity3 rail link are set to claim compensation for ‘ exceptional hardship ’ after a @entity7 quango was today forced to disclose secret information it tried to keep hidden			1
in a landmark victory for blighted residents , an appeal judge has ordered the @entity3 company - set up by ministers to run the controversial £ 33billion high speed line – to make public details about how far from the track it is allowing ‘ exceptional hardship ’ compensation claims			1
the tribunal judge also told bosses at @entity23 firm @entity3 that it was time to ‘ treat the public like grown ups ’ and credit them with having enough intelligence not to ‘ misunderstand ’ the requested data			1
thousands of home - owners blighted by the high - speed rail link are set to claim compensation for ' exceptional hardship ' the judgement came after @entity3 had argued – unsuccessfully - that it needed to keep secret the details because ‘ disclosure would lead to a significant rise in the number of applications			1
’ but the tribunal said people were sensible enough not to misunderstand the significance of ‘ a bald distance number ’ and that disclosure was ‘ in the public interest			1
’ the judge overturned an earlier decision by the privacy watchdog information commissioner which had backed @entity3 ’s attempt to keep the details secret			1
the ruling is now set to open the floodgates to many more ‘ exceptional hardship ’ applications from people living much further away from the 351 - mile track linking @entity55 to @entity56 and beyond to @entity57 and @entity58			0
some have been told by banks that their properties are now worth ‘ zero ’ because of the blight caused by proximity to the high speed railway			0
it is a humiliating blow for the firm and was hailed by protesters as a major victory			0
campaign groups say the ruling is significant because it gives home - owners an insight into the distance criteria being used secretly by the @entity7 quango when considering ‘ exceptional hardship ’ compensation claims from people forced to sell because of emergency reasons such as poor health or divorce			1
an appeal judge has ordered the @entity3 company to make publicise details about how far from the track it is allowing compensation claims yet despite the judge ’s ruling , taxpayer - funded @entity86 are still refusing to disclose the farthest distance from the high speed line it had granted exceptional hardship compensation – taking advantage of the 35 - day window to decide whether to comply with the disclosure ruling , or to appeal further			1
protest groups said the ‘ batting average ’ for successful claims so far is ‘ around 300m ’ from the line but they suspected some so - far undisclosed claims might stretch to up to 0.62 miles – a kilometre – away			1
the battle for disclosure began when retired homeowner @entity104 from @entity105 , @entity103 applied for ‘ exceptional hardship ’ compensation for himself and his wife after being unable to sell their rural home			0
@entity86 rejected their claim saying they failed to meet two key criteria , saying that the evidence submitted did not convince them ‘ that there was an urgent need to sell now ’ and ‘ because of the distance of the property from the proposed high speed line			0
’ mr @entity104 then asked @entity3 how far away from the track the farthest successful claim had been			1
opposition : but the line will run through the @entity122 , with villages like @entity124 set to be on @entity3 route to the fury of many but @entity3 refused to reveal this citing exemption under the @entity129 stating it would ‘ prejudice the effective conduct of public affairs			1
’ mr @entity104 then appealed to the information commissioner which backed @entity3 ’s stance saying that disclosure was ‘ likely to prejudice the effective conduct of public affairs and that the public interest favours withholding of the requested information			1
’ @entity3 was therefore ‘ not obliged to disclose the information			2
’ but the appeal tribunal headed by judge @entity142 overturned that decision and backed the residents			2
the tribunal ’s official judgment said : ‘ we conclude , unanimously , that @entity3 was not justified in refusing the @entity148 ’s request for information and that it should be disclosed to him			1
’ it added : ’ we have decided that @entity3 was not entitled to withhold information about the distance between the route of the proposed line and the property which was furthest away from it , but had nevertheless qualified for assistance under @entity159 ( @entity160 )			1
’ and the judge ’s ruling adds witheringly : ‘ we think that @entity3 ’s expressed fear about the public ’s inability to understand the disclosed information does not give the public enough credit for its ability to delve behind over-simplified media headlines or slanted statements from pressure groups			1
’ the panel said : ‘ it does not require information to be withheld from the public as though , in the words of the @entity148 ’ , the public was not sufficiently grown up to be trusted with it			2
’ anger : a field in @entity180 in @entity181 where the @entity3 will go through the middle of , sparking large local opposition the ruling noted that @entity3 did not challenge evidence from mr @entity104 that local estate agents considered that ‘ prices had been significantly reduced across an area extending up to three miles either side of the proposed route			2
’ @entity3 ’s location criterion imposed ‘ an unnecessarily strict limitation on qualifying properties			2
’ the @entity160 is discretionary and open to those whose properties are ‘ significantly adversely affected ’ and who live in ‘ close proximity ’ to it and can prove they are unable to sell because of @entity3 , and had ‘ no prior knowledge ’ of the route , as well being able to ‘ demonstrate hardship ’ defined by strict criteria such as serious medical reasons or divorce			2
these claims , if successful , are fast - tracked and paid out much quicker than the normal compulsory purchase claims			2
it has particular significance for stricken residents like 97 - year - old widow @entity211 who has been left penniless because of plans for the high - speed rail line through her @entity103 village village of @entity216			0
the former postmistress had to move into a nursing home last year and needs to sell her four - bedroom cottage to pay the care bill			0
but a local couple who made an offer on the property , with an asking price of £ 275,000 , were refused a mortgage on it because the new line is scheduled to pass 500 yards away and said it had a value of ‘ zero			0
’ now mrs @entity211 , who ran a post office from the property until she was 90 and received an mbe in 1998 for her services to scouting in the village , fears she will be unable to afford her £ 3,500 - a - month care bills			0
@entity236 : @entity238 's former post office in the village of @entity216 in @entity103			0
the value of the property is ' zero pounds ' because of the disruption @entity3 will cause @entity238 in the post office in 1998 which she needs to sell to pay for her care bill @entity3 insists there is no geographical limit for people claiming compensation under the ‘ exceptional hardship ’ scheme			2
but protesters at the ‘ @entity252 ’ say @entity3 must ‘ come clean ’			2
experts believe up to 350,000 properties have been blighted by the controversial line which will not be completed until 2032 , leaving the government with a total compensation bill of around £ 2.5billion			0
@entity3 disputes this but is unable or unwilling to provide figures			0
@entity260 of the @entity252 said : ‘ this is a great victory for common sense and shines a bright light on @entity23 secrecy over this scheme			0
@entity266 made under the ‘ exceptional hardship ’ rules are extremely difficult because there are so many difficult hoops to jump through			0
this should inspire more people to claim			0
’ mrs @entity260 from @entity271 in @entity103 , said that original phase 1 ‘ exceptional hardship scheme ’ had so far completed just 65 successful claims at a cost of under £ 20million , though 83 have been accepted to date			1
the ruling comes just days after the government launched a consultation on the ‘ exceptional hardship rules ’ for the second phase of the line from @entity56 to @entity58 and @entity57			0
the judge ’s report notes how @entity284 , manager of the @entity159 scheme argued in her witness statement that : ‘ disclosure would lead to a significant increase in the number of applications , many of them unmeritorious , because they would arise out a misunderstanding of the relevance of the bald distance figure			0
this would delay the process for other applicants			0
’ contacted by @entity301 , an @entity3 spokesman said : ‘ we note the outcome of the @entity305 ’s decision and we will now consider how best to respond			0
‘ @entity3 ’s original decision to withhold the information was intended to uphold the public interest and was supported by the information commissioner			1
the @entity305 agreed that this was a reasonable position for @entity3 to take , but held , on balance , that it was in the public interest to disclose the information			1

the tribunal judge said it was time to ' treat the public like grown ups '
judgement came after @entity3 had argued it needed to keep the details secret
protest groups said average for successful claims is ' around 300m ' from line
