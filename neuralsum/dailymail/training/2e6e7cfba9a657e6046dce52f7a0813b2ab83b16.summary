the fossil of a 247 - million - year - old giant sea dragon discovered in @entity2 could be evidence that more species survived during the world 's greatest mass extinction			1
the @entity7 , named after the researcher who discovered the fossil 2008 , is described in @entity10 as being 22 - feet - long			1
its unearthing suggests that other marine creatures recovered more broadly following the event known as the @entity15 – @entity16 - or ' @entity17 '			2
the @entity7 , named after the researcher who discovered the fossil 2008 , is described in @entity10 as being 22 - feet - long			1
it could be evidence more species after ' the @entity17 ' the fang - teethed creature would look similar to this and would have roamed the seas around @entity2 as many as 250million years ago it occurred around 250 million years ago and was the worst extinction event of all time killing off 96 per cent of species			1
today , all life on @entity30 is descended from the remaining four per cent of species that survived			1
it is unknown what triggered the wipe - out - but some scientists have blamed it on a volcanic eruption			0
the creature is part of the @entity40 , a group of aquatic reptiles in the @entity16 period ( era lasting from 250million to 0.25million years ago ) that evolved from ancestors living in the @entity15 period - which began 299 million years ago the disocvery was one of 22,000 found during a research project in @entity2 into how life recovered following the world 's largest mass extinction among the findings were a number of marine species - including shellfish - that were alive during the @entity16 period which began 250million years ago a large number of the species in the @entity15 era died out , with some only recovering in certain areas			1
but scientists believe the finding suggests recovery is ' globally synchronous '			0
@entity66 , one of the paper 's authors , told @entity69 : ' the huge size is definitely the most apparent feature of this predator			0
' they would eat anything they could catch , including large fishes and other marine reptiles at the time			0
' the associated professor at @entity80 added : ' this predator is in the top of the prehistoric food web			0
modern leopard seals from @entity85 might be an appropriate analogue for this giant predator from the ecological perspective			0
' the fossil was one of 20,000 found on a mountain in @entity2 - including shellfish and pre-historic creatures - that revealed how life recovered after the worldwide extinction			1
this beaked creature was also found during the project			0
around 94 per cent of the species in the @entity15 era ( which began 290million years ago died out ) during ' the @entity17 ' @entity101 revealed in october suggested there is evidence of a major marine extinction in the @entity105 just eight million years before the @entity17			1
an extinction event around this time has been the subject of previous studies , but this is the first to document the event in high latitudes			0
' one of the pre-requisites for a “ mass extinction ” is that it has to be a global event , ' professor @entity112 from the @entity113 told @entity119			0
according to the history books , five mass extinctions have devastated the planet since it formed 4.6 billion years ago			0
@entity125 - @entity124 mass extinction - 443.4 million years ago this was the third largest extinction in @entity30 's history , and had two peaks of dying separated by hundreds of thousands of years			1
around 26 per cent of all marine families were wiped out and 60 per cent of all genera - an estimated 82 - 88 per cent of all species			2
late @entity134 mass extinction - 375 - 359 million years ago three quarters of all species on @entity30 died out in the @entity137 , though it may have been a series of extinctions over several million years			1
around 22 per cent of all marine families , and 57 per cent of all genera were wiped out - an estimated 79 - 87 per cent of all species			2
many of the archaeological digs took place on this mountain permian mass extinction - 252 million years ago the @entity15 mass extinction has been nicknamed @entity17 , since an incredible 96 per cent of species died out			1
all life on @entity30 today is descended from the 4 per cent of species that survived			2
@entity16 - @entity153 mass extinction - 201 million years ago there were two or three phases of extinction that made up the @entity16 - @entity153 mass extinction event			0
22 per cent of all marine families and 53 per cent of all genera - an estimated 76 - 84 per cent of all species			2
@entity162 - tertiary mass extinction - 66 million years ago the @entity164 mass extinction was the event that wiped out the dinosaurs			2
however , many other organisms perished including 16 per cent of all marine families and 47 per cent of all genera - an estimated 71 - 81 per cent of all species .			0

fossil named @entity7 was found in @entity2 in 2008
is 22 - feet - long and is described as having fang - like teeth
suggests species could have survived more widely following the extinction
' the @entity17 ' wiped out 96 per cent of all species
@entity30 's remaining animals said to have evolved from those who survived
