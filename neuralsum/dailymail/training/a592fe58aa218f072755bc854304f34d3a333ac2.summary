@entity0 warned the party leadership not to demand the resignation of @entity4 as the price of joining forces @entity7 should prepare for a @entity8 with @entity4 , according to @entity9 heavyweight @entity0			1
the former business secretary said the party should not make the same mistake as 2010 when it refused to contemplate having to do a deal with the @entity14 to stay in power			1
@entity0 warned the party leadership not to demand the resignation of mr @entity4 as the price of joining forces			1
the @entity19 said : ‘ in 2010 some senior @entity14 said a precondition of a viable deal with @entity9 was @entity23 ’s departure			1
‘ @entity23 did eventually agree to stand aside in the autumn , but i do n’t think it would be any more appropriate to say who their leader should be than it was for them to do so in 2010			2
’ @entity0 also said it was too early to contemplate a deal with the @entity34 – warning that many in the party would find it too ‘ difficult to stomach ’			1
he said : ‘ there is talk of a coalition with the @entity34 , rather than or in addition to the @entity14 – i just think it is far too early to contemplate that , and who knows how they will do on the day			1
’ the @entity9 peer insisted that preparing for a @entity8 did not mean he thought mr @entity7 was on course to fall short of a majority at the next election			1
he said it was ‘ not defeatist to consider the different scenarios in which we can get the @entity53 out ’			0
speaking to the @entity54 , he said : ‘ @entity9 has to be careful about two things – it must not appear tribal or exclusive in its politics and it must not repeat its 2010 lack of preparation			1
’ he added : ‘ @entity7 is an intelligent and adaptable person			0
if @entity9 is ahead on seats i am sure he will want to give it his best shot			1
’ the former @entity65 heavyweight – the first secretary of state under @entity23 – said @entity9 and the @entity14 would be able to iron out its differences			2
he said : ‘ where there is a will there is a way , but it will be harder to scramble something together at the last moment if there has been no thinking through beforehand			0
’ @entity0 added : ‘ achieving greater fairness and protecting those most in need would be relatively easy to agree between @entity9 and the @entity14 , as would the position on @entity80 , while the harder issues would be reducing the financial deficit and long - term debt			1
‘ we can not achieve anything we want without economic growth and policies to achieve that will have to come first			0
security against terrorism would also have to be hammered out			0
’ @entity0 ( left ) was the first secretary of state under @entity23 and served in the @entity65 with @entity7 ( right ) mr @entity7 should consider how @entity9 could form a coalition with the @entity14 leader @entity4 , said @entity0 he said @entity9 under @entity23 had failed to prepare properly for @entity8			1
the peer said : ‘ some of us certainly contemplated beforehand what would happen if we lost our overall majority in 2010 , but we did nothing about it , and during the weekend after polling day we had to make up in 48 hours what we had failed to do in the previous three months			2
‘ no real attempt had been made to get on working terms with the @entity14			0
‘ @entity23 had good personal relations with @entity105 and @entity106 , and he talked to them regularly – a relationship that continued in the weekend of talks in 2010			0
but he was not on the same terms with @entity4			2
‘ we were rapidly trying to make up for lost time			0
@entity23 asked me to lead the @entity9 coalition talks [ and ] though i doubted the post-election arithmetic would add up i gave it all we had			2
‘ but it was all too makeshift			0
if we had been serious the talking should have started long before , as i suspected it had informally between the @entity14 and the @entity53			0
for them , the chemistry fell into place quite quickly			0
we were fighting a losing battle			0
