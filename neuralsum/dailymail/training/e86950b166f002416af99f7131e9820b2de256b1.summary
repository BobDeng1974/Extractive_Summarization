@entity12 managed to get a special @entity13 that fit her entire surname name on it but it expired in may
the *replacement* cut her *lengthy* *moniker* short
her driver 's license also trims her last name and leaves off her first and middle name entirely
when she *compalined* , she was to revert back to her maiden name or change her last name *permanently* to make life easier
the @entity107 said it was working to extend its character limit to 40 to resolve the issue
