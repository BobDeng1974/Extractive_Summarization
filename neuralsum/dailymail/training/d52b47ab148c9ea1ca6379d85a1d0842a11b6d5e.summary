by @entity0 miss g , whose identity can not be revealed after a ruling by the @entity4 a frail 94 - year - old spinster fighting council social workers for the right to live in her own home without their interference has been banned from talking publicly about her plight			1
in what is thought to be an unprecedented move by the secretive @entity4 , the former @entity14 midwife – who can be identified only as @entity15 – has been told she does not have the mental capacity to communicate with journalists and that it is in her ‘ best interests ’ not to do so			1
the gagging ruling – which could last for the rest of her life – was made yesterday by a high court judge who sent a message via a clerk to the @entity28 , which has highlighted miss g ’s case , warning : ‘ this means the press can not speak to @entity15 any more			1
’ the draconian attack on freedom of speech flies in the face of recent demands by the top family court judge , sir @entity36 , for more openness in the shadowy court , allowing those appearing there to speak publicly about their experiences			0
the @entity28 has campaigned against secrecy in the @entity4 , which takes sweeping decisions on behalf of the old , infirm , and disabled over where they live , with whom , and even whether their life - support machine should be switched off in the event of severe illness or if they should be allowed or forced to take contraception			1
miss @entity51 has fought a six - month battle with social workers in @entity54 , north east @entity55 , who say a couple who live with her at her £ 350,000 house are controlling her life and decision - making			1
the council hopes to send in its own carers , with miss g footing the bill			0
they have argued that the couple , known as mrs c and mr @entity68 and from the same @entity70 island as miss g , should be thrown out of the house			2
miss @entity15 has already been told by the @entity4 that she does not have the mental capacity to make decisions about her care , financial affairs , legal representation , or where she lives			1
the gagging order was made by the judge granting a special ‘ declaration ’ that she should not ‘ communicate with the press ’			1
miss @entity51 and the couple who care for her face a prison sentence or stiff financial penalty if she does so			2
earlier this year , @entity15 signed a petition in @entity86 highlighting her plight and staged a public protest in her home borough			2
at one court hearing , she handed a letter to judges saying she wanted to use her own name when she spoke to the @entity80			0
miss @entity15 has already been told by the @entity4 that she does not have the mental capacity to make decisions about her care , financial affairs , legal representation in previous interviews with the @entity28 , @entity15 described her experience as ‘ being like a fly in a web , with me being the fly and the social workers the spiders ’			1
she said : ‘ i do not want the council people in my life			0
in the past , when they provided carers from an agency , they did not look after me			0
i was left in a dirty house alone for hours at a time when they cut short their twice - a - day - visits			0
‘ they did not shower me often enough and there were foxes in the garden and insects in my bed			0
’ miss @entity15 said it was only when she cancelled her council care plan that ‘ @entity54 began to persecute me and the private carers i chose , who look after me so well ’			0
in court yesterday , she told the judge : ‘ they [ the social workers ] think i am a stupid old woman but i am not			1
they have made false accusations and think they can do what they like			0
i want them out of my life and to live in peace			2
’ @entity128 mp @entity127 , who campaigns for @entity4 openness , said : ' this gag appears to be totally unprecedented the court also heard that an independent social worker ’s report has recommended that @entity133 and mr @entity68 should be allowed to stay and that @entity15 is well looked after by them			2
@entity54 has now said it needs time to consider that report before the final long - term plans for @entity15 are put in place			0
during previous hearings , the court was told that social workers , accompanied by police , had turned up at @entity15 ’s house 12 times in nine months after @entity133 and mr @entity68 moved in			1
‘ the visits were frightening and it was to try and get rid of this couple who are like my family and look after me perfectly ’ , @entity15 has said			0
@entity54 – which the court has allowed to be named following a request from the @entity28 – refuses to comment on details of the case			0
however , @entity128 mp @entity127 , who campaigns for @entity4 openness , said last night : ‘ this gag appears to be totally unprecedented			2
‘ it is difficult to see who it is protecting if not the local council social workers from public criticism			1
it is certainly not miss g who is protected			0
‘ the worry is other social workers may now use the same tactics to stop press scrutiny of their actions and that can not be right			1
