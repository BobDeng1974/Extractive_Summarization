by @entity1 reporter published : 09:02 est , 23 may 2013 updated : 09:03 est , 23 may 2013 the nation 's record - low teen birth rate stems from robust declines in nearly every state , but most dramatically in several @entity6 and among @entity7 , according to a new government report			1
all states but @entity10 and @entity11 showed significant drops over five years			0
but the @entity6 of @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 saw rates fall by 30 percent or more			0
in 22 states , teen @entity20 birth rates plunged at least 40 percent , which was described as ' just amazing , ' by the report 's lead author , @entity22 of the @entity24			1
teen birth rates : all states but @entity10 and @entity11 showed significant drops over five years			2
but the @entity6 of @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 saw rates fall by 30 percent or more what 's driving the declines ? no one can say for sure			0
experts believe the explanation is complicated and probably varies a bit from state to state			0
the national figure has been falling since 1991 , aside from a brief interruption in 2006 and 2007			0
- lowest rates of teen births are in @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41 , each with rates under 17 per 1,000			1
- @entity45 rates overall continue to be in the @entity46 , led by @entity47 and @entity48 , each with rates of about 50 per 1,000			1
in @entity47 , the majority of teen births are to white moms			1
in @entity48 , the majority are black			1
- white teens continue to have the lowest birth rate nationally — about 22 births per 1,000			1
black teens saw a larger improvement , but their rate was still more than twice the white rate , at 47 per 1,000			1
- overall , the @entity20 rate plummeted from 75 to 49 per 1,000 , now virtually a tie with the black rate			1
the @entity24 report released thursday is based on birth certificates for 2007 through 2011			0
last year , the @entity24 announced the overall improvement in teen births : a record low of 31 births per 1,000 teens ages 15 to 19			1
that compares to 42 births per 1,000 five years earlier			2
the teen drop in the last five years coincided with an overall decline in births , which experts attribute to a weak economy that dampened enthusiasm for having children			0
@entity20 women have been part of that trend , possibly due to the economy and to illegal immigration crackdowns in some states that reduce the number of young @entity20 females entering the country from @entity89 and other nations , said @entity91 , a @entity92 professor of population and family health			2
that means new immigrants are having less impact on birth statistics , and second - and third - generation families are having more influence			2
as time goes on , @entity7 — like other immigrant groups before them — tend to adopt @entity105 customs and practices			0
' there is more attention on education , career , and the future , ' said dr. @entity114 , head of @entity115 of @entity116 , a @entity108 - based organization focused on preventing teen and unplanned pregnancies			0
hispanic rates , though , continue to be much higher than those for blacks and whites in most of the states with the largest @entity20 populations , including @entity125 , @entity116 , @entity126 , @entity127 , @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity89 and @entity128			1
young mother : @entity130 , 18 , prepares her daughter @entity131 to go home from daycare at @entity134 in @entity135 , @entity136 @entity116 has the highest number of teen births in the nation , with nearly 43,000 in 2011			2
nearly two - thirds were to @entity20 moms			2
the overall improvement , though , is something to celebrate , said @entity144 , chief program officer of the @entity145 to @entity146 and @entity147			0
' geography , politics , or policy alone simply can not explain the widespread declines , ' @entity144 said in an email			0
' credit goes to teens themselves who are clearly making better decisions about sex , contraception , and their future			0
