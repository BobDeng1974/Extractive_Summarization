president @entity0 made a rare 2014 campaign stop on tuesday evening in @entity2 , @entity3 , to rally the party faithful for @entity7 gubernatorial candidate @entity6			1
at a packed gymnasium , @entity0 held up democrat @entity6 as a skilled businesswoman who will fight for the type of middle - class opportunity that made his own success possible			2
riffing on health care , the minimum wage and women 's issues , @entity0 steered clear of referring directly to the state 's @entity19 governor , @entity18 , instead lumping him together with a @entity19 he accused of pushing antiquated and failed policies - such as opposition to fair pay legislation backed by @entity7			1
but even an appearance by the president was n't enough to keep some of @entity29 's supporters at the rally engaged - midway through @entity0 's remarks , attendees began to trickle out			1
president @entity0 , right , kisses @entity45 candidate @entity6 during a campaign rally at @entity37 on tuesday , october 28 , 2014 , in @entity2 even the setting for @entity0 's rally - a high school in a mostly black part of @entity2 - served as a reminder of how limited @entity0 's appeal has become , both in geography and demographics ' some people -- not a lot , but some -- are leaving as the president is speaking , ' @entity56 reporter @entity55 tweeted			1
a video taken in the overflow room of the event , held at @entity37 , also shows a stream of attendees heading for the exits			0
this is the second time this month @entity0 's had this happen at a campaign rally			1
attendees of an event for @entity72 's @entity7 gubernatorial candidate @entity71 also walked out on @entity0 , showing just how far the president 's standing has fallen since he won reelection in 2012			1
@entity7 hope @entity0 's appearance with @entity29 will help put her over the top in next week 's tight race , while @entity19 confidently predict @entity0 will have just the opposite effect			1
defeating @entity18 , a potential 2016 presidential contender and nemesis of labor unions , would be a major coup for @entity7 that could help boost the party 's morale in a rocky political season			2
democrats are still bruised from a failed 2012 effort to recall @entity18			0
this year , polls show the race deadlocked between @entity18 and @entity29 , with very few voters undecided			0
' the eyes of the country are on us , ' @entity29 said as she introduced the president			0
@entity0 has been a rare sight on the campaign trail this year - he made his first appearances just over a week ago - in large part due to low approval ratings that make him a potential liability for @entity7			1
even the setting for @entity0 's rally - a high school in a mostly black part of @entity2 - served as a reminder of how limited @entity0 's appeal has become , both in geography and demographics			1
opposition : @entity3 gov. @entity18 speaks to members of the media following a tour of @entity115 in @entity116 , @entity3 , on monday			1
@entity18 is being challenged in his reelection race by @entity29 only seven voters in the ward where @entity0 held his rally voted for someone other than @entity0 in 2012 , records show			2
still , the @entity123 hopes @entity0 can help turn out high numbers of voters who backed his own presidential campaigns - chief among them african - americans , hispanics , young people and women			0
' the country as a whole is doing better			0
@entity3 's not doing so good , ' @entity0 said			2
' over the next week , you have a chance to change that			0
you have a chance to choose a governor who does n't put political ideology first			0
' speaking about the economy , @entity0 said that unlike @entity18 , ' @entity6 does nâ€™t believe that the minimum wage " serves no purpose , " ' he said			1
' it do n't make no sense ! ' an audience member shouted in reference to @entity18 's position on the issue			0
' it do n't make no sense , ' @entity0 replied , according to @entity150			0
' it do n't make no sense , ' the president said			0
' we need to strengthen the middle class for the 21st century			0
that means we need leaders from the 21st century who actually believe women should get paid the same as men , ' @entity0 said to cheers and laughter			0
the rally before 3,500 people , including former ' @entity167 ' actor @entity166 , opened a week of last - minute campaigning by @entity0			2
he plans to travel to @entity169 , @entity170 , @entity171 , @entity172 and @entity173 - all states where @entity7 are optimistic about the governor 's races , in contrast to the party 's gloomy expectations for the @entity180			2
shaking hands and kissing babies : president @entity0 works the crowd after a rally at @entity37 in @entity2 but even in @entity3 , @entity0 's ability to fire up democrats without driving up @entity19 turnout is in question			1
@entity190 , head of the @entity19 of @entity3 , said @entity0 's appearance with @entity29 would remind voters that @entity0 's economic policies are on the ballot on @entity195			1
' @entity3 ca n't afford a governor who will walk lock - step with president @entity0 and his failed policies that have hurt our country and would take @entity3 backward , ' @entity190 said			2
before arriving at the rally , @entity0 headed to a chic downtown sushi joint , where he met privately with about 25 donors who gave $ 16,200 and up to the @entity204 .			0

@entity0 called on a crowd of approximately 3,500 supporters in @entity3 to get their friends to the polls on nov. 4 at a rare 2014 campaign stop
@entity7 want to replace @entity19 gov. @entity18 with @entity6
an appearance by the president may not be enough to put her over the top - midway through @entity0 's remarks , attendees began to trickle out
