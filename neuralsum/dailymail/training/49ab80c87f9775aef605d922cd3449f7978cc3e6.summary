by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 one of the many appealing things about @entity3 is the complete lack of world weariness about him			1
he looks ahead to wednesday 's lip - smacking quarter - final against @entity9 with a disarming idealism that could only come from a youthful challenger and it can only whet the appetite further			1
‘ that ’s the beauty of tennis , it ’s basically a gladiator battle			2
it ’s two people , one of them is going to come out and win , ’ he said yesterday			2
‘ what a great way to do that kind of thing			2
whether he is quite ready to take down the defending champion is open to question but he is ready to give it a go			2
‘ i am here to bring my goodies ! ’ is how he put it			0
one thing this will not be is a grudge match			0
the two camps are so close that , in the week before @entity56 , a 200metre race was held between @entity3 ’s coach @entity57 and @entity9 ’s fitness trainer @entity58			1
@entity9 holds @entity57 in such high regard that he nearly hired him as his coach before the appointment of @entity62 and it is easy to see why in the progress that the 23 - year - old @entity64 has made			1
as a tennis player @entity3 has gone from boy to man in 12 months and doubtless there has been some positive influence from @entity36 , the ultimate pro. @entity3 does not want to play up the @entity36 angle but acknowledges that some of her attitude has rubbed off			1
‘ there is no competition between us , not at all			0
we are at different stages			0
she has had an incredible career so far and has won a lot of incredible titles			2
i am just starting , ’ he said			0
‘ i think we can both learn things from each other			0
she is the best example of an athlete and player with her work ethic			0
even before i knew her and all that , i thought she was the best			0
’ no more @entity3 : @entity3 has grown from boy to man on tour this year no 1 fan : @entity3 's girlfriend @entity36 cheers him towards victory at @entity96 @entity97 3in height 6ft 3in 13st 3lbs weight 12st 8lbsright - handed @entity100 wins 120142 @entity101 8528 career titles 4 £ 18,638,690 prize money £ @entity57 coach @entity57 had @entity57 been available now , @entity9 might well have called him again but in the event he has made the innovative choice of @entity106 as coach , with every match now a sterner test than the last			1
@entity57 spoke on tuesday for the first time in the tournament , as uncomfortable with the spotlight ’s glare as @entity3 appears to be relishing it			1
yet she has enjoyed the work with @entity9 , who has played sublimely well so far this fortnight			1
‘ we are getting to know each other much better and entering more the phase where we can tease each other , we can go a little bit more into details because i ’m getting to know his game much better so it is developing the way it is supposed to , ’ she said			0
jokes : @entity106 's relationship with @entity9 has reached the stage where they can tease each other @entity9 3 - 1 @entity3 2014 : @entity133 , semi-final — @entity135 won 4 - 6 , 7 - 6 ( 5 ) , 7 - 6 ( 3 ) 2013 : @entity136 , third round — @entity138 won 7 - 6 ( 3 ) , 6 - 3 2013 : @entity139 , final — @entity138 won 7 - 6 ( 0 ) , 6 - 4 2011 : @entity141 , quarter - final — @entity138 won 6 - 4 , 6 - 4 ‘ you are n’t going to change things or say everything you want because he has his own habits , his own way of doing things , and i do n’t think it would be wise to all of a sudden come up with some very different thing			1
there is a difference for sure , a huge difference between men ’s and women ’s tennis			0
i noticed it , i lived it as a player			0
’ while the intention has always been for this to be a long - term arrangement , she did not want to project into the future yet			2
‘ now i am in the moment , it is good fun , it is going well			0
we will see if it goes further or not			0
regardless if it does , it is a great experience			0
’ same again please ! @entity9 has not dropped as set on the way to the defence of his @entity56 title this time last year @entity9 had come through serenely , only to nearly come unstuck against @entity179 ’s @entity178 before coming back from two sets down			1
@entity3 is so confident that he would surely punish such a slip - up wednesday			1
like it was for the @entity184 , this is something of a free hit for @entity3			1
he knows there will be lots of future opportunities , while @entity9 is aware that the time to win again is now .			1
