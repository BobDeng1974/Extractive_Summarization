she said : ‘ i did what i what hope most people in their right minds would do			2
‘ the council has spent a lot of money , which at the end of the day is our money , doing a nice job refurbishing the park - but some of these children just love being destructive			2

‘ this kind of teen gang ca n’t take over play areas like this without people who bring their own children up properly asking them to behave			0
