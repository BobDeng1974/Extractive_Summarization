got your juicer ready to start your liquid - only diet or are you set to starve yourself two days a week from january 1st ? if it 's your @entity5 's resolution to lose weight and you plan to follow a fad diet in order to do it then you are doomed to fail , according to the author of a new book			1
@entity11 believes we would all be fitter and slimmer if instead of cutting carbs , gluten or dairy from our diets , we just cut the cr * p instead			1
using her formidable alter - ago , @entity32 , @entity11 tells it how it is to give people a reality check on their waistlines			1
she said the first step for anyone wanting to lose weight is to acknowledge they are fat because of their own lifestyle choices - not because of their genes , their job or their family			1
the author of a new book has no patience for people who eat chocolate and complain about being overweight she writes : ' every time you are in a newsagents buying sweets or chocolate because you are starving and desperate for a sugar hit , remember this : someone else slimmer and fitter than you was feeling the same way , yet chose to eat an apple			1
and then went for a run			0
' that is the unpalatable truth that no one is telling you straight			0
you need to accept that you being overweight is no one 's fault but your own			0
' she adds : ' the reason you are fat is you eat too much cr * p and you do n't move enough			1
' the author : @entity11 has written cut the cr * p to help and inspire people to become healthier @entity11 writes that anyone who seeks salvation for their figure in a faddy diet is fooling themselves - because they wo n't be able to stick to it			1
she uses the women she has observed in her local north @entity81 coffee shop as an example			0
' they discuss their fasting or no carb diets while munching on pastries and sipping lattes			0
' educated interesting women spending their precious time and energy discussing diets while eating cr * p , ' she writes			1
@entity11 believes that faddy diets and promises of miracle fixes are ' distracting us from the real issues '			1
' the important stuff about food that actually matters : from food labelling to portion sizes , from sugar addiction to our insatiable appetite for processed foods - issues that demand our scrutiny so that we can make better foods choices for ourselves and our increasingly porky children			1
' thus in the book , @entity11 does not promise miracles or a ' magical elixir juice recipe that is going to answer your prayers '			1
instead , she reveals how to make lifestyle choices that will last beyond january so you can become fitter and healthier for life			2
she explains ways to stay motivated and provides recipes that are healthy but simple to make - and even your children will eat them			2
she knows as she tested them out on her own four - year - old twins			2
be accountable : @entity11 said many people have to accept they are overweight because of the choices they have made instead of blaming other factors like their genes or job ( posed by model ) she said people need to aim for healthier choices ' most of the time ' ( treating yourself occasionally is fine but bingeing on sugary food every day is not )			1
she said people need to be more educated about what is in the food they eat by becoming vigorous about checking labels for the nutritional content			2
in particular , caution should be taken when it comes to foods that claim to be healthy because they are low in fat or calories			0
a quick check of the label could reveal they are high in sugar and salt			0
@entity11 said to lose weight , people should think @entity148			1
@entity149 : less of it a @entity151 : more of it @entity153 is for processed goods : fewer of these @entity11 is also passionate about encouraging people to exercise more in order to stay fit and healthy			1
the 39 - year - old former criminal barrister took up running herself in her mid- 20s after agreeing to do a marathon			1
she knows from experience that it 's not fun at the beginning because you are unfit but that does n't mean you should quit			0
' everyone hates it until they have practised it religiously for sometime , ' she admitted			0
she added : ' i would n't say i enjoy running but i enjoy the benefits that running brings such as getting outdoors and feeling healthier			0
i certainly did n't enjoy it when i first started			0
' i can honestly say i hated every single one of those early runs as they were incredibly difficult and i was out of breath within minutes feeling like i was on the verge of a heart attack			0
' everyone has the same 24 hours a day and if president @entity179 can find time to exercise , you can , says @entity11 she also has a comeback for the other excuses people peddle for not being active , such as ' i do n't have time ' ( ' everyone has the same 24 hours a day , president @entity179 finds the time and i guarantee he has more to get done in a given day than you do in an entire week ' )			1
and ' i do n't have the right build for running ' ( ' there 's no such thing as the right build			0
it 's an excuse often used by large breasted ladies but i once ran with a double @entity190 cup friend who wore two sports bras ' )			0
she 's previously written the book @entity193 ! tch @entity193 about what 's she 's learnt about running and how she got fitter			2
despite her initial dislike of the activity , she 's now made it a part of her life and goes for a jog regularly			2
she 's not currently training for a marathon but running has become a habit - this is what she encourages in her book			1
find something that you can do regularly that keeps you active such as running , walking the children to school or going to a twice weekly @entity211 class and it will do wonders for your long - term health			2
combined with eating less sugary foods and fewer processed goods , you will be slimmer - it 's really that simple			2
cut the cr * p : the @entity219 will be published by @entity30 on 15 january , Â£ 12.99 despite their best intentions , many people may take up running this @entity5 and give up by mid-january due to lack of motivation and support			1
but @entity224 , a new running challenge kicking off on january 5 , may be the secret to staying on track			0
this is an online challenge that 's open to everyone of all abilities , with a range of goals			0
participants set their own personal activity targets for their fitness , health or performance goals and strive to stick them during january , february and march			2
runners can take part individually or as part of a team and every workout logged contributes towards a participant 's overall @entity245 score			0
participants can also raise money for charity with @entity250 and @entity251 and also track their activity levels and routes with the sports social network , @entity256			0
