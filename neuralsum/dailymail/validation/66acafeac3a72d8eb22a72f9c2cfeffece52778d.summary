@entity0 claims he felt close to suicide during the mass outrage over footage that showed him punching his then - fiancee unconscious			1
it is just over a year since the former @entity7 player was captured on surveillance cameras attacking @entity9 in the elevator of a casino in @entity12 , @entity13			1
reflecting on the past year , which saw him dropped from the league , @entity0 told the @entity16 he felt like ' it was n't worth living '			2
' the big picture of it all , being the person that i am , i really felt horrible , ' @entity0 told the newspaper in an interview			2
i know i 'm never going to win the battle of public opinion			0
honestly , i almost felt like at one point that it was n't worth living			0
i see why people commit suicide			0
' it hurt that bad			0
i was low , real low			0
it hurt that bad because you worked your whole life to do all the right things and then you 're the world 's most hated person			0
' it was really tough			0
my daughter , oh lord , i grew up without a father , there 's no way i could check out on my own family			0
' it comes after he issued an apology to @entity7 fans , who turned up in their droves last year to exchange their @entity0 jerseys for new ones with other players ' names			2
@entity0 was booted from the @entity7 after footage was leaked showing him knocking out his now - wife in a casino elevator the @entity65 lifted the ban on @entity0 in november and allowed him to become a free agent but he remains untouched by any team in a statement on @entity70 , he wrote : ' to all the kids who looked up to me , i 'm truly sorry for letting you down , but i hope it 's helped you learn that one bad decision can turn your dream into a nightmare			1
' there is no excuse for domestic violence , and i apologize for the horrible mistake i made			0
' the running back , who helped the @entity7 win the @entity82 in 2012 , is currently a free agent , after his indefinite ban from the league was overturned upon appeal in november			1
@entity7 owner @entity28 has said @entity0 will never play for the team again			1
but @entity0 said he valued the time he spent with @entity28 , general manager @entity89 and head coach @entity90			2
@entity0 told his fans that ' one bad decision can turn your dream into a nightmare ' ' i love you all very much , and i 'll always be proud to say i played for the @entity7 , ' he said			0
the @entity65 's inept handling of @entity0 's case plunged the league into crisis			1
he was originally suspended just two games , after a hotel video showed him pulling an unconscious @entity9 from an elevator in an @entity12 casino			1
the punishment was widely denounced as too lenient , and when another video that showed the actual punch surfaced , the @entity7 sacked him and @entity65 commissioner @entity105 banned him indefinitely			1
the @entity106 successfully appealed on the grounds that the league violated labor laws by increasing @entity0 's punishment after the second video surfaced because it gave no real new information on the case .			1

@entity0 says he understands how people can feel suicidal
@entity0 has been a free agent since november when the @entity65 lifted his suspension , he has yet to get close to *signing* with another team
his *career* was *effectively* ended after surveillance video captured him punching now - wife @entity9 unconscious in a casino elevator in @entity13
