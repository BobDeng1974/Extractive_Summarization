by @entity0 published : 13:22 est , 1 november 2013 updated : 13:22 est , 1 november 2013 women have a different friend for each occasion and whether it 's a patient @entity5 , a sassy @entity6 - a - like or a no - nonsense @entity8 , they are all important wing women for different aspects of our lives			1
she does n't beat around the bush , has serious stamina , a good eye for design and a very flexible credit card			1
you can always rely on her to give you honest feedback when trying clothes on and she trusts you to do the same			1
every woman has a @entity24 , @entity6 and @entity25 in their lives ... as well as a @entity27 you make an excellent tag team when going into the sales , grabbing things off the rail you know the other person would like			1
what 's more , you know her measurements like your own			2
the @entity5 - or the @entity38 - is often one of your older friends , a mother figure who you can talk to about stuff you would n't want your mother to know			1
she has had more life experience than you and is always willing to talk if you have a problem - just make sure you do n't do it too often or you will be seen as our next archetype ... the crybaby only calls for a whinge			1
you let this friend cry on your shoulder once when one of her many relationships ended , now you are the default agony aunt to all her problems			2
expect to have a fun time with your @entity6 , but beware , she never knows when enough is enough she rings at the most inconvenient hours , usually either from the loos at work or last thing at night after she 's had a few too many glasses of wine			1
immortalised by @entity65 in @entity7 , she does anything , says anything and is , at the best of times , a loose cannon			2
she 's great to go out with in the evenings and you can always expect to have a fun time with her - but beware , she never knows when enough is enough			1
if you are always the one hosting the dinner parties or inviting your friends round to see your new home improvements then you are the @entity25			2
this domestic goddess cooks , cleans and always looks immaculate and boy , do her friends know about it			2
we are all a little bit jealous of our @entity25 friends but they can still be relied upon for a fun evening and fantastic cooking			1
the @entity25 hosts dinner parties and enjoys inviting friends round to see her new home improvements the @entity89 is a person you have met a couple of times and , you 're friends on @entity93 - other than that there is little else			2
you do n't really have anything in common other than a mutual acquaintance and if you by chance bump into each other in the street , the conversation is extremely limited and quite awkward - especially if you 've forgotten their name			0
the @entity103 friend is someone who you used to have real fun with until they tied the knot			1
now there 's no more nights on the town , all you ever do is ' coffee at mine on saturdays ' and conversation is limited to what her kids are up to			0
of course you do n't resent her getting married and starting a family , you just want a bit of your old friend back			0
@entity24 the @entity27 is a friend everyone hates to admit they have			0
they 're ready to fill a gap when a better friend ca n't make a night out			0
the @entity130 friend is the ultimate queen of gossip			0
she will know other peoples ' business well before they do and wo n't be afraid to hold her tongue			0
you go to her when you want the latest scoop however , you are careful of how much of your own news you let her have			0
she often gives the impression of being loyal to you , but when news starts spreading about you and that guy you met the other night , you probably know where it has come from			0
of course , on the list compiled through research by @entity146 , there is also the @entity24 , your most trusted friend , who you are able to do anything with , whether that 's going out for a night on the town or hitting the shops			0
you will have known her for at least five years ( but probably for much longer ) , her number will be on your speed - dial and more than likely you will be bridesmaids for each other .			0

the @entity6 is great to go out with in the evenings and lots of fun
the @entity5 is a mother figure who you can talk to about stuff
