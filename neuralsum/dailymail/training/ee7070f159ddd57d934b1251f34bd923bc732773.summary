by @entity0 published : 07:18 est , 10 october 2013 updated : 03:58 est , 6 january 2014 her body is her career so it makes sense that no expense is spared when it comes to the health regime of supermodel @entity9			1
indeed , the slender @entity12 's @entity11 girl is so keen to keep her diet on the straight and narrow that she has invested £ 500 in a swanky blender she says does a whole lot more than just whizz up fruit and veg , reported health and beauty site @entity18 this week			1
. @entity22 's kitchen companion is a state - of - the - art @entity23 ( now there 's a name for a kitchen gadget ) she uses to whip up her much - loved daily smoothie : a chia seed and goji berry concoction			1
gadget : the @entity33 blender is loved by health conscious a-listers like @entity9 , but it will set you back £ 500 celebrity trainer @entity37 ( famous for training @entity38 and @entity40 ) is a fan , and personal trainer and nutrition expert @entity41 rates the machines highly too , using one to make 60 shakes a day at @entity44 , his @entity46 gym			1
after a year and a half of very high usage , @entity41 says the blender is still as good as ever			1
he uses his to blend up shakes for the likes of @entity44 client @entity52 , who has previously extolled the virtues of his @entity55 and @entity56 smoothies mixed with almond milk and coconut oil			1
and @entity41 's wife @entity60 whips up soups in a few minutes while juggling work and baby			1
' it 's actually kind of a miracle , ' he says			1
so what sets this blender apart from the norm ? the kitchen device markets itself as much more than an ordinary blender thanks to laser - cut blades that reach speeds of 240 mph making light work of fruit and vegetable pulp , skin , pips and seeds			1
the high powered blades create a ‘ blend ’ of smoothie or juice that contains 100 per cent of the goodness and nutrients from fruit and vegetables			2
the firm claims that the @entity23 blender is powerful enough to break down the cell walls of fresh , whole foods to deliver the full benefit of nutrients			2
tough fibrous cell walls on fruits work like a barrier , they say , preventing us from efficiently digesting the nutrients inside our bodies			2
removing these with a powerful chopping tool can help your body digest all the nutrients available in the ingredients			2
fresh fan : @entity9 made a video for @entity105 showing her fans how to whip up her morning smoothie using the expensive gadget the device , whose jug is made of the same material as aeroplane windows or police riot shields , grinds wholegrains into flour , makes ice cream in moments by whizzing frozen berries with yoghurt or cream , and can make hot soup in five minutes from fresh vegetables thanks to the friction created by the fast - spinning blades			1
nutritionists say making soup in this way is the healthiest method of cooking as you can evenly warm a soup through without burning any of the ingredients or boiling away nutrients			0
you can put apple core , stalks , carrot tops , peel of lemon and lime or ginger in the machine			2
wholefoods use it to make smoothies , @entity144 make frappuccinos using the device and @entity149 even make their @entity150 with it			0
laying her blender love on the line , @entity9 made a video tutorial for @entity155 's the edit to show her fans exactly how to create her morning smoothie at home			1
‘ boys like their cars , i like my @entity23 , ' she joked in the tutorial			1
@entity162 , @entity163 at @entity164 , said : ' the numbers of stars following juice diets has sped into the stratosphere of late			0
' from a-listers wanting to get red carpet ready to reality stars wanting to trim down and get healthy , they 're all on board the juicing train			0
' so it was only a matter of time before a new juicing machine took celebsville by storm			0
' @entity23 is a new juicer that claims to speed up the juicing process and leave a smoother , ' no bits ' result			2
good news for juicing fans			0
' nutritionist @entity184 , who works with @entity185 , said : ' @entity23 is awesome , it is obviously the best of the bunch			0
however @entity189 are making some really good less expensive blenders too			0
' personal trainer : @entity41 of @entity192 , who is credited with sculpting @entity52 and @entity195 's bodies , is also a fan of the @entity23 blender @entity52 , who has one of showbiz 's most enviable figures , recently praised her ‘ delicious green juice ' which she described as ' a great way to start the day			1
' but what ’s behind this mysterious concoction ? along with other super healthy ingredients such as cucumber , kale and parsley , the @entity206 wholefood @entity207 is added to the juice			0
and it ’s not just @entity52 who ’s caught the @entity215 bug , @entity9 has admitted that she takes @entity217 supplements to keep her skin in check			1
green vegetable smoothie @entity221 , who ’s a nutritionist and green food expert at @entity217 , has shared her tips for the perfect morning smoothie ...			0
' with everyone from @entity52 to @entity185 drinking green smoothies recently , you ’d be forgiven for thinking this is just another beauty fad			1
' we all know that we ’re probably not eating enough greens , yet our greens contain the most vitamins and minerals of any foods we eat , and are the most important category of foods to consume on a daily basis to help keep us healthy			0
@entity239 smoothies can be high in vitamin @entity240 , which can help reduce tiredness , and magnesium , which is found in dark green vegetables and can act as nature ’s tranquiliser , helping to keep us de-stressed and relaxed – so it ’s no wonder so many busy celebs are trying it ! you ’ll notice that a lot of models are now adding green supplements to their juices , to up their nutrient intake even further			0
for instance , a daily serving of the @entity206 wholefood @entity207 contains iron content equivalent to nine cups of spinach ( 270g ) and the same @entity240 content as a 32oz steak			0
perhaps most importantly , these drinks provide large quantities of whole food natural vitamins and minerals and help increase our daily intake of fruit and vegetables – for busy people who still want to remain healthy , this is hugely important			2
smoothies are also full of fibre and water along with a whole range of nutrients which naturally makes us feel fuller which reduces the desire to consume food generally especially sugar and carbohydrates			0
we recommend the @entity284 of blenders , the @entity23 blender , as it breaks down the cell walls of fresh , whole foods to deliver the full benefit of nutrients			2
it also saves time as all of the ingredients can be added at once			0
' @entity9 and @entity52 ’s green juices and smoothies are so nutritious , simply because greens contain the most vitamins and minerals of any foods we eat , and are the most important category of foods to consume on a daily basis to help keep us healthy			1
combining these into an easy to drink smoothie can help busy people cram as many of these vegetables into their daily diet as possible			0
juicing and blending raw green vegetables and living micro greens ( sprouts ) containing fresh vibrant green chlorophyll are extremely nutritious ways of creating optimum health and energy			0
just juice : @entity52 has revealed that she loves @entity217 ( like those pictured right ) green juices juicing or blending any raw green vegetable , especially the living leafy varieties , is an effective way of increasing oxygen in the body and helping to build healthy tissues			1
@entity322 maintains life and is a rejuvenator of all body systems			0
@entity239 smoothies containing the ingredients seen in @entity52 and @entity9 ’s can be high in vitamin @entity240 , which can help reduce tiredness			1
the spinach in @entity52 ’s signature smoothie is high in magnesium , which is found in dark green vegetables and can act as nature ’s tranquiliser , helping to keep us de-stressed and relaxed – so it ’s no wonder so many busy celebs are trying it ! you ’ll notice that a lot of models are now adding green supplements to their juices , to up their nutrient intake even further			1
for instance , a daily serving of the @entity206 wholefood @entity207 contains iron content equivalent to nine cups of spinach ( 270g ) and the same @entity240 content as a 32oz steak – vitamin d in particular is important for winter , as this nutrient is produced by natural sunlight , and long cold winters can cause @entity356 to become deficient , meaning it ’s important to top up where possible			0
to make a @entity52 or @entity9 style green smoothie , try the delicious recipe below at home			1
freshly juiced fruits should always be diluted 50:50 with water in order to dilute the sugar content			0
blend the below ingredients , adding the water first			0
600ml mineral water ( still ) ½ chopped cucumber ( skin & pips included ) ¼ peeled avocado 1 chopped celery stick juice of ½ lemon or lime ¼ teaspoon unrefined salt @entity217 ‘ a ’ tablets : initially starting off with 5 tablets for the first three days , moving up to 10 for the next 3 days and then 15 tablets herein after			2
small double handful ( 60 - 80mg ) of mixed green leaves from the following ( they can be combined ) : spinach , watercress , rocket , savoy cabbage , chard , lettuce , chicory , kale , bok choy , sprigs of mint , parsley , coriander , basil .			2
