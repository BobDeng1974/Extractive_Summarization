using in - built ' factory reset ' and ' delete - all ' services on phones with @entity6 's @entity5 operating system is not enough to cleanse them of personal data , new research has revealed			1
experts found they were able to pull tens of thousands of photos , emails , text messages and more from used phones being on @entity14 that previous owners had thought they had ' wiped ' clean			1
the findings suggest that mobile owners should be much more thorough if they are planning to sell their phone to prevent their data being accessed			0
they found they were able to recover large amounts of personal data ( image supplied ) with publicly available programmes from used phones they bought on @entity14 that had seemingly been ' wiped ' by the previous owners more than 40,000 stored photos more than 1,500 family photos of children more than 750 photos of women in various stages of undress more than 250 selfies of what appear to be the previous owner 's manhood more than 1,000 @entity6 searches more than 750 emails and text messages more than 250 contact names and email addresses four previous owners ’ identities one completed loan application the study by @entity25 , a @entity26 - based internet security firm , found they could easily retrieve personal data from smartphones sold online , despite consumers deleting their data			1
aside from 40,000 photos and 250 ‘ compromising ’ selfies of men , the company was even able to discover the identity of several sellers , and one person ’s completed loan application			2
the huge multitude of data was recovered from just 20 used smartphones , highlighting just how much data can be retrieved from a small number of used phones			1
these were phones where the previous owners had performed a factory reset or a ‘ delete all ’ operation on their devices with in - built software			1
despite doing this , however , @entity25 was able to gather vast amounts of data			0
only one phone had third - party security software installed , and it actually gave up the most personal information of all			2
in response to the findings , @entity6 said : ' this research looks to be based on old devices and versions ( pre-android 3.0 ) and does not reflect the security protections in @entity5 versions that are used by the vast majority of users			2
' if you sell or dispose of your device , we recommend you enable encryption on your device and apply a factory reset beforehand ; this has been available on @entity5 for over three years			1
' the huge multitude of data was recovered from just 20 used smartphones			2
aside from 40,000 photos and 250 ' compromising ' selfies of men , the company was even able to discover the identity of several sellers , and one person 's completed loan application the phones were all bought from @entity14 ( image shown )			1
these were phones where the previous owners had performed a factory reset or a ' delete all ' operation on their devices with in - built software , apparently to no avail			1
more than 80,000 used smartphones are for sale daily on @entity14 in the @entity126 , according to @entity25 to recover the data @entity25 used programs called @entity129 , a disk imaging programme , and @entity131 , an app management programme			1
in one example , @entity25 explains how they recoevered ‘ deleted ’ messages from a @entity136 chat from an @entity138 smartphone			0
‘ the amount of personal data we retrieved from the phones was astounding , ’ said @entity139 , president of @entity140 at @entity25			2
‘ we found everything from a filled - out loan form to more than 250 selfies of what appear to be the previous owner 's manhood			0
‘ we purchased a variety of @entity5 devices from sellers across the @entity126 and used readily available recovery software to dig up personal information that was previously on the phones			1
‘ the take - away is that even deleted data on your used phone can be recovered unless you completely overwrite it			1
@entity162 recommends that you encrypt your device before wiping it , which can be done in the ‘ security ’ section of the ‘ settings ’ menu			0
next you ’ll want to perform a factory reset , which is done in the ‘ backup & reset ’ section of the @entity166 menu			2
for added protection you then need to load your phone with ‘ dummy ’ data , such as stock photos and video , so people ca n’t steal your identity			0
now perform another factory reset , erasing the dummy data			2
repeat this three times or more to be as secure as possible			0
your data is not only now buried beneath dummy content , but if someone does get that far into your phone they ’ll find it is encrypted as well			0
one solution to this problem is to repeatedly perform factory resets on the phone			0
this should be done after encrypting it , which can be done from the settings menu			0
the phone should also be loaded with dummy data , so if someone does gain access they have to get through multiple levels before finding personal data more than 80,000 used smartphones are for sale daily on @entity14 in the @entity126 , according to @entity25			1
‘ along with their phones , consumers may not realise they are selling their memories and their identities , ’ @entity139 adds			0
‘ images , emails , and other documents deleted from phones can be exploited for identity theft , blackmail , or for even stalking purposes			0
‘ selling your used phone is a good way to make a little extra money , but it ’s potentially a bad way to protect your privacy			0

@entity26 - based firm @entity25 has revealed a huge flaw in @entity5 devices
they bought 20 used phones off @entity14 and recovered ' deleted ' data
to do so they used publicly available programmes such as @entity129
they then found they could access the data of people who had used *default* deleting or ' factory reset ' services
even some phones with third party software were easily *hackable*
haul of data *included* 40,000 personal photos and 1,500 photos of children
they also recovered more than 1,000 compromising adult images of the previous owners of the phones
