@entity0 has teamed up with car manufacturer @entity1 to develop new self - driving cars that could be used to race across the surface of @entity5			1
the technology created during the five - year partnership will also be adapted to create better driverless vehicles that can be used on roads on @entity10			1
robotics experts from the space agency will work with engineers from @entity1 to adapt the company 's electric leaf cars			1
however , @entity0 believes sensors and systems being developed to help driverless cars deal with pedestrians , cyclists , overtaking vehicles and parked cars , could also help to develop new robotic rovers for use in exploring other planets			1
@entity0 is hoping to send the next generation of rover to continue exploring the @entity5 in 2020			1
with upgraded hardware and instruments , it will examine the @entity5 rocks and assess the potential of the environment for humans to live in one day and search for signs of @entity5 life			2
it will identify and collect rock and soil samples , which it will eventually be able to send back to @entity10 intact with the help of another future spacecraft that will land on the surface and pick them up			0
dr @entity56 , director of @entity0 's @entity57 , has previously said that collecting a rock sample and bringing it back to @entity10 is @entity0 's top priority			0
scientists are particularly interested in the samples so they can understand the hazards posed by @entity5 dust and demonstrate how oxygen can be created - details important to consider for human missions to @entity5 and the future colonisation of the planet			1
the rover marks the next major step in fulfilling president @entity72 's challenge of sending humans to @entity5 in the 2030s			0
in an attempt to speed up the next rover , the @entity77 currently rovers like @entity0 's @entity81 move at an achingly slow pace over the surface of @entity5 - it has a top speed of 0.08mph ( 0.13km/h )			1
this is slow progress is necessary to allow the rover 's computers time to detect and manouvour around obstacles like rocks and deep sandpits that might bog it down			0
such limitations have meant that missions to the @entity5 have explored just a tiny fraction of its surface			2
the @entity98 has traveled just 25 miles in more than 10 years on the planet			0
by adapting technology to be used on @entity10 's roads , it could allow rovers to travel at far greater speeds and explore much more of the surface			1
this could prove crucial in scouting out potential sites for future manned missions to the @entity5 surface			0
dr @entity110 , director of @entity111 in @entity112 , told @entity113 : ' the more we look at it , the more there are a lot of similarities there			0
' we have a rover on @entity5 - it is not very autonomous			1
as we go deeper into space , into more and more dangerous locations , we need to add that autonomy			0
' it is not the first project that @entity0 and @entity1 have collaborated on			2
in 2005 the two organisations teamed up to develop more comfortable and safer car seats			0
@entity1 drew upon data from @entity0 's @entity129 at its @entity130 that had used experiments from space to examine the neutral body position of astronauts while they were sitting in low gravity			2
@entity1 used this to build seats for its cars that would lower the amount of fatigue drivers would feel and reduce pressure spots			2
previous rovers have spent years exploring less than 100 miles of the vast surface of @entity5 ( above ) @entity1 ceo @entity145 , picutred above on the left , and @entity111 director @entity147 , on the right , have agreed to collaborate on technology for use in autonomous vehicles and rovers the @entity5 surface , seen here in this ' selfie ' by @entity0 's @entity81 , is littered with rocks , deep sand and other obstacles that pose a threat to vehicles but technology developed for cars on @entity10 could help among the first steps in the new collaboration will be to map the roads around @entity111 in @entity112 so that @entity1 can test drive adapted autonomous versions of its @entity19 electric vehicles ( above ) dr @entity169 , director of @entity1 's @entity170 , who spent 12 years working as a senior scientist at @entity111 , is thought to be the architect behind the latest collaboration			1
he told @entity113 : ' this is a perfect blend of the capability of what the robotics folks at @entity178 have and the autonomy that we bring			0
' in the latest project engineers will begin by conducting online simulations before hoping to get an actual car on the road by the end of 2015			0
@entity0 's track record in building spacecraft and rovers that are reliable and have significant degrees of latent safety will be invaluable to building autonomous cars for use on @entity10			1
@entity0 's @entity81 , seen above in an artists impression , has a top speed of just 0.08mph as it needs to avoid obstacles but it is hoped that future rovers will be able to negotiate the @entity5 surface at higher speeds there are some who fear that software glitches and mechanical faults in autonomous vehicles that share the road with human drivers could turn them into death traps			1
however , dr @entity110 added : ' all of our potential topics of research collaboration with @entity1 are areas in which @entity178 has strongly contributed to major @entity178 programs			0
' @entity178 developed @entity5 rover planning software , robots onboard the @entity217 and @entity218 air traffic management systems to name a few			1
' we look forward to applying knowledge developed during this partnership toward future space and aeronautics endeavors			0
' @entity145 , president and ceo of @entity1 , added : ' the work of @entity178 and @entity1 â€“ with one directed to space and the other directed to earth , is connected by similar challenges			0
' the partnership will accelerate @entity1 's development of safe , secure and reliable autonomous drive technology that we will progressively introduce to consumers beginning in 2016 up to 2020			1
' some experts have raised concerns about how humans themselves will respond when sharing the road with autonomous vehicles			2
a recent report by the @entity241 highlighted research that showed human drivers change their behaviour when using the same roads as autonomous cars			0
motorists were found to copy the driving style of the computer controlled cars by leaving less space between them and the vehicle in front , but were less able to react quickly			0
now @entity255 has realised that if it wants its driverless cars to be able to compete with pushy human drivers on the open road , they too need to be more assertive			2
after testing its autonomous vehicles over 700,000 miles of public road , @entity255 's engineers have tweaked the software that controls the cars to give them a slightly more aggressive edge .			1

engineers at @entity0 and @entity1 will work on new technology for robotic cars
@entity1 hopes it will help them build driverless cars for use on public roads
it has pledged to have its first autonomous vehicles on the market by 2020
@entity0 hopes to develop new rovers that can avoid hazards on other planets
sensors and systems to avoid pedestrians that are being developed for self - driving cars could be adapted for to help rovers avoid rocks on @entity5
it could allow robots to move more quickly across the surface of @entity5
