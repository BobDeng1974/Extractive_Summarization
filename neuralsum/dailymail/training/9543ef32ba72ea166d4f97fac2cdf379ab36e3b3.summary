a new cap on pension charges will save average earners £ 100,000 over their lifetimes , ministers said last night			1
the plans , aimed at stamping out high and unclear charges , are designed to boost the value of pension pots when people retire			1
it is expected the new rules will transfer some £ 200million from the pensions industry to savers over the next ten years			1
a new cap on pension charges will save average earners £ 100,000 over their lifetimes , ministers said last night ( file picture ) from april , people who are placed into a workplace pension as part of automatic enrolment will see their charges capped at 0.75 per cent			1
the average earner currently pays into a fund charging 1.5 per cent			0
the plans were laid before @entity26 in draft regulations yesterday			1
pensions minister @entity28 said the changes would ensure people would not see their money ‘ disappear in opaque charging structures ’			2
he said : ‘ there is an understandable buzz around what april will bring for those retiring now , with the unprecedented pension freedoms coming in			2
but these reforms show we are also determined to help the pensioners of tomorrow			0
’ ministers said the new cap could save around £ 100,000 for an average earner who was currently paying into a fund charging 1.5 per cent , over the course of their working life			1
mr @entity28 told @entity48 : ‘ with pension charges the devil is in the compounduing , because the numbers look very small and innocent but quickly mount up			1
‘ people saving into a pension today can have the confidence they will get good value for money throughout their working lives			0
’ pensions minister @entity28 ( pictured ) said the changes would ensure people would not see their money ‘ disappear in opaque charging structures ’ the charge cap applies to the default pension options that people are placed into as a result of auto - enrolment into workplace pensions , to protect them against unwittingly having large chunks of their pots eaten up by high costs			1
savers can still choose to be in a pension with more expensive costs if they want to , because the saver will be making an active decision to shop around after weighing up the costs against the benefits			2
the updated draft regulations will mainly come into force on april 6			2
this is just as the government ’s retirement revolution is put into action , meaning that people aged over 55 will have much greater freedom over how they take their pension pot and they will no longer be herded towards buying a retirement annuity			0
more than five million people have been automatically enrolled into workplace pensions so far as part of the drive to encourage stronger savings habits as the population lives for longer			0
by 2018 , as many as nine million will be newly saving into a pension or saving more			0
meanwhile , the @entity95 also set out new rules that will require firms to set up independent governance committees for workplace personal pension schemes			0
these committees will act in savers ’ interests by assessing the value of pension schemes and challenging providers to make changes where necessary			2
the rules will also come into force on april 6			0
the move follows recommendations by the @entity95 ’s predecessor body the @entity110 , which highlighted problems in 2013 , when it said that the buyer side of the market was ‘ one of the weakest ’ it had analysed in recent years			0
the @entity110 found that neither employers nor employees could be expected to drive effective competition between firms			0
around £ 30billion of savers ’ money in older defined contribution workplace pension schemes was considered by the @entity110 to be at risk of delivering poor value , by modern standards , because of potentially high charges .			1
