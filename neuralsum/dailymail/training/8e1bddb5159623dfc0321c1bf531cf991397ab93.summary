by @entity0 published : 10:02 est , 10 april 2013 updated : 01:45 est , 11 april 2013 @entity2 police have apologised after @entity4 president @entity3 was mistakenly put on the country 's secret list of criminals			1
the premier would have been arrested at the border had he tried to enter the country after he was added to the register for his contact with the @entity4 motorcycle gang @entity13			1
mr @entity3 is not suspected of committing a crime in @entity2 himself and a police spokesman said that his name had now been removed and an investigation launched into how it got there			2

' i wish to extend @entity4 's president @entity3 sincere apologies for the incorrect registry entry , ' interior minister @entity38 said in a statement			0

we 're used to seeing mr @entity3 taking any opportunity to cultivate his action man image in a series of macho poses , fly fishing bare - chested or diving into an icy river			0
but @entity3 's latest man - vs - nature photo opportunity appears to have shown us his softer side - as he has been snapped rolling around in the snow playing with his dogs			1
dressed in a patriotic red and white @entity4 snow suit and wearing a warm - looking fur hat , the @entity4 premier looked at ease as he strolled in the forest snow close to @entity22 with his fluffy pets , @entity64 , an @entity65 , and buffy the @entity29 @entity66			2
but never one to miss the opportunity of a good publicity shot , @entity3 's hat was soon off and he was soon rolling around in the snow with the two dogs			1
puppy love : @entity3 strokes @entity25 while @entity64 looks on walkies : mr @entity3 had originally worn a warm hat as he walked his dogs in the forest , but the hat soon came off and he was rolling around in the snow with his pets the @entity4 premier has been pictured in the past tagging tigers , shooting crossbow darts at a whale and flying a fighter plane			1
he has even released his own judo dvd imaginatively entitled ' @entity85 with @entity3 '			0
but the latest publicity shots of mr @entity3 are a far cry from embarrassing pictures earlier this week when he was snapped looking bemused as he was confronted by topless protestors while in @entity90			2
the activists , who strip off to highlight a range of issues , including women 's rights , press freedom and domestic violence were dragged kicking and screaming from the premises by security guards as one women tried to push through to @entity3 she was blocked by his aides - her back was painted with an obscene word directed against the @entity4 president			2
they stripped off to the waist and shouted slogans calling the @entity4 leader a ' dictator ' before being covered up and bundled away by security men			0
knee deep : the president makes his way through thick snow as he walks buffy the @entity29 shepherd close to @entity22 winter coats : @entity3 , pictured with his two dogs , is no stranger to action - packed publicity shots having been photographed flying a fighter jet and fly fishing shirtless in the past but a smiling @entity3 eventually shrugged off the protest and joked : ' as for the action , i liked it			1
