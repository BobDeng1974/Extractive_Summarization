after spending 47 years chasing criminals across @entity3 , @entity1 's longest serving policeman has hung up his helmet			1
@entity6 @entity5 joined the @entity7 at the age of 19 in 1968 , when officers relished in their £ 855 annual salaries and marvelled at the recent technological development of personal radios			1
some five decades later and having been involved in some of the city 's most notorious crimes , the 64 - year - old has retired			1
at a moving ceremony in @entity17 today pc @entity5 shook the hand of more than 100 officers who had turned out to bid him farewell			1
he arrived at the honour guard in a vintage @entity22 panda car - used by officers in 1968 - and accompanied by two of the @entity7 's white @entity27 horses			1
the 64 - year - old was celebrated at a horse guard ceremony in @entity17 , south @entity3 today ( left )			1
he joined the force in 1968 shortly after his 19th birthday as a trainee cadet ( right ) asked what advice he would give today 's force , he smiled : ' it 's all about people , about their problems , and you try and just help them the best you can			1
' born in @entity17 in 1950 , @entity40 was among the first batch of officers to operate under the @entity43 , still in use today			2
he spent 13 weeks at the @entity7 's training centre in @entity46 before serving at stations in @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 an @entity51			1
in the late 1990s , he joined the @entity17 branch , where he carried out his last day 's work to rapturous applause today			2
speaking of his commitment to the job , mr @entity5 said humbly : ' i always wanted to do something like public service , looking after people			1
' and that is what it basically is			0
sometimes it 's arresting them but other times it 's protecting people , looking after them , and that is what i wanted to do			1
i have been quite content to do that			0
' reminiscing about his first few years in service , mr @entity5 spoke of how much the strains of his job had changed			1
we did n't always have radios , no panda cars - it was more or less coming on from @entity77 , where you had a whistle , a truncheon , a police box to go into to make calls to the station to say you were safe and pick up your calls from			2
' if it was an emergency call they used to flash the light on top to get people to go to the box to answer it - that 's what it was all about			1
' it was a quieter pace of life			0
you went out and had a particular beat to do			0
it actually was checking shop doorways and shops to see they were locked and things like that - that 's what you did			1
' mr @entity5 was driven to the ceremony today in a vintage @entity22 panda car ( above ) like those used when he first joined the force in 1968 mr @entity5 shook the hand of every police officer who turned out to celebrate him today , greeting more than 100 people in the street @entity7 officers lined the streets outside @entity117 to wave @entity40 off this afternoon in a touching ceremony when @entity40 signed up to join the @entity7 in 1986 as a cadet trainee , a typical salary for an officer of his age was £ 855 a year			1
while women had been accepted to the force they earned significantly less at £ 775 , working fewer hours than their male peers			2
the first black female police officer joined in the year mr @entity5 signed up			1
in 1968 , @entity130 was at the helm of the force as commissioner			2
many expected his role to be temporary following the sudden death of his predecessor @entity137			0
@entity139 in fact served until 1972			0
most significantly around the year in which mr @entity5 joined the force , say historians , is the introduction of new technology			1
' personal radios had just been introduced which is the biggest , most remarkable thing , ' @entity145 , manager at the @entity146 said			0
' of course there was the introduction of the @entity43 which we still use today			0
' another crucial change in the law was implemented in the case of @entity155 vs @entity7			1
the trial brought about the introduction of mens rea , latin for ' guilty mind ' , which denotes a defendant 's deliberate intention to cause harm			2
@entity129 was the first black female to join the force in 1968 ( left )			2
at the time , @entity130 ( right ) was serving as commissioner @entity40 joined the force at the time of @entity77 , the 1960s programme depicting life as a @entity3 police officer and starring ( from left to right ) @entity171 , @entity172 , @entity173 and @entity174 an officer on point duty stops traffic to help a woman pushing a pram cross the road in central @entity3 five years after signing up he was involved in the high profile shooting of @entity183 businessman and @entity185 boss @entity184 who was killed by @entity188 terrorist @entity187			1
in 1978 he worked alongside a special branch during the arrest of @entity191 , a member of revolutionary terrorists the @entity194 , or the @entity194			0
@entity40 was also on duty during the first @entity197 riot in 1981 , facing bricks , bottles and burning buildings			0
aside from a few short breaks he worked for three whole days as he and his fellow officers struggled to keep order			2
perhaps the darkest day of his time in uniform came on february 8 1994 , when he and three colleagues responded to an armed robbery at a sub-post office in @entity209			0
one of them , sergeant @entity211 , was stabbed			0
@entity40 gave him first aid and watched on desperately as medics tried to save his life to no avail			0
of how much the profession has changed since then he added : ' it has had to evolve because society has changed , has n't it			0
" there 's a certain amount of more violence			2
i think police officers need to be protected more and they are protected more , and the equipment 's better than it used to be			1
' when i stopped working on the streets i was wearing body armour , i was carrying an asp , i had @entity228 gas and everything else , and that 's just been brought about because of the amount of violence we are having to face sometimes			2
' it is time to go			0
my job has run it 's course and it 's time to go to on to pastures new			0
i did n't want to stay on any longer and i think i 've done what i wanted to do			0
it 's time to do something different			0
' asked what advice he would pass on to the younger generation of officers , mr @entity5 said : ' listen to people , go with the training , do n't always assume that something facing you is the whole story , and ask people what 's really going on before you make any decisions			1
' and just be patient - you have got to have a lot patience , because you are called names , and the names do n't really mean anything			0
the veteran policeman was accompanied by two of the @entity7 's white @entity259 as he drove towards @entity260 today throughout his 47 - year career the officer has been involved in the arrests of high profile murderers and policing of riots ' it 's all about people , about their problems , and you try and just help them the best you can			1
that 's what i 've tried to do all my service , and try and remain cheerful and polite			2
' last week the 64 - year - old was awarded the @entity275 at @entity276 , one of the highest honours an officer can achieve			1
at the ceremony in @entity17 today , chief superintendent @entity280 , @entity17 's borough commander , said : ' for me @entity283 is the epitome of a good police officer , someone who wanted to serve as long as possible on the front line , and he is an ideal role model to younger serving officers			1
' i spoke to an officer recently with 30 years service who dealt with an incident with @entity283 over the last couple of weeks , and they said they learned something from how @entity283 dealt with it			1
' the fact that @entity283 could show a really experienced officer how something could be dealt with really pays testament to him			0
' we are very proud and we will be sorry to see him go , and i think this police station will be a sadder place because he is retiring			0
' mr @entity5 now plans to spend more time with family in @entity307			1
tragically his wife @entity308 died last year , followed by his son , @entity309 , who died of pneumonia last month			0
today his sister and nephew were among those lauding him as a credit to the police force			0
' ( the ceremony ) is nothing more than he deserves			0
he would n't have wanted all this but it is just amazing			0
we are immensely proud of him , ' said @entity5			2
mrs @entity321 added : ' i ca n't find the words , really			0
our mother was so proud , and had photos of him on the wall and used to tell people , " that 's my @entity325 up there			2
