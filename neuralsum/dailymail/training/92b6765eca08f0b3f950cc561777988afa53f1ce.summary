@entity0 has revealed he was not ready to return to international cricket when the @entity3 coaching job came up this year and warned that @entity5 's team is suffering from a lack of participation in the @entity9 and @entity8			1
the former @entity10 international was on the @entity13 's shortlist to replace @entity14 but opted out of the process after tentative discussions			1
another @entity10 , @entity17 , was the only overseas candidate interviewed by the @entity13 , who were keen to appoint a homegrown coach , but @entity0 's formidable cv would surely have made him a strong contender			1
too soon : former @entity10 international @entity0 has revealed that he was not ready to become @entity3 head coach instead , @entity24 returned to the post and @entity0 continued his role with @entity28 franchise @entity27 as well as a new job as director of cricket at the @entity8 , which begins on july 11			1
outlining his decision to stand aside , the 48 - year - old said : ' i had conversations with the @entity13 but i made the decision not to continue my interest in the position			2
' i 'm very fortunate to have some incredibly exciting jobs with the @entity8 , the @entity28 and in the media and i was n't ready to make the leap of faith back into international coaching			1
' who knows , i may have thrown my hat in and come fourth or fifth			0
' like most things in life it was down to timing , and it was n't right for me , but it 's an incredibly attractive job and i certainly would n't close the door on international coaching in the future			0
' as for the scale of the job he decided against pursuing , @entity0 sees both an intriguing challenge and a difficult set of circumstances			2
wanted man : former @entity58 coach moody was on the @entity13 's shortlist to take over from @entity14 the idea of regenerating a side that was partially dismantled as a result of the @entity63 whitewash last winter is an appealing one to him , but he is mindful of the fact that @entity3 's schedule rules most players out of joining other global stars at the @entity28 and @entity8 ' @entity3 is a very attractive job right now because any job where you 're coming in at the rebuilding stage is exciting , ' he said			1
' there 's an opportunity to put your thumb print on the team , on the brand of cricket you want , on the values you think are important			0
' but losing to @entity58 last month was a bit of a wake - up call and when the @entity84 series starts ( on wednesday ) it 's not a given that it 's just going to be a home - patch win			2
' teams are getting wiser and smarter about playing in other parts of the world and franchise cricket - the @entity28 , the @entity8 - is a lot to do with that			1
room for improvement : @entity0 believes @entity5 's side are struggling because of a lack of participation in the @entity28 and @entity8 ' it 's a lot of international players sharing a dressing room , breaking it down			1
' @entity3 's summer is the reason they ca n't do that and , forgetting about the financial side , they are missing out on a unique opportunity			0
' these competitions are the best learning experience you can have as a player or a coach			0
' take a young player like @entity116 ... if he 's not there there 's no doubt his progress is not going to be as rapid as someone who is getting those experiences			0
' @entity0 is the @entity121 for the @entity8			2
the @entity122 in @entity123 begins on 11th july in @entity124			0
