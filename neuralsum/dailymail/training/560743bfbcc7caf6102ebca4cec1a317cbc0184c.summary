by @entity0 published : 08:19 est , 5 january 2014 updated : 08:19 est , 5 january 2014 @entity3 fighter jets have flown for the first time with parts made using 3d printing technology			1
@entity7 said the metal components were successfully used on board tornado aircraft which flew from the defence firm 's airfield at @entity12 , @entity13 , late last month			1
the company said its engineers are using 3d technology to design and produce parts which could cut the @entity18 's maintenance and service bill by over £ 1.2 million over the next four years			1
@entity3 fighter jets have flown for the first time with parts made using 3d printing technology @entity7 is working at @entity22 , @entity23 , to engineer ready - made parts for four squadrons of @entity27 aircraft , including protective covers for cockpit radios and guards for power take - off shafts			1
some of the parts cost less than £ 100			1
@entity32 , head of airframe integration at @entity7 , said : ' you are suddenly not fixed in terms of where you have to manufacture these things			2
' you can manufacture the products at whatever base you want , providing you can get a machine there , which means you can also start to support other platforms such as ships and aircraft carriers			0
' and if it 's feasible to get machines out on the front line , it also gives improved capability where we would n't traditionally have any manufacturing support			2
' @entity7 said the metal components were successfully used on board tornado aircraft while 3d printing is seen as a positive technology by many – it is thought it can revolutionise engineering and the medical industries – it is also a controversial innovation			1
in the @entity62 , several guns have been produced using the technology , with varying degrees of success			1
one of the latest models , which includes a rifled barrel to ensure deadly accuracy , is said to have been made with just £ 15 of materials			2
the latest generation of 3d printers work by building up layer upon layer of material - typically plastic - to build complex solid objects			2
the guns are assembled from separate printed components made from plastic , with only the firing pin and a few bolts made from metal			1
the @entity83 in the @entity3 said it will not be possible to ban 3d printers , so officials are working on alternative strategies			2
these could include stiff jail sentences for possession of the weapons and making it illegal to download the plans			0
in the @entity62 , more than 100,000 plans for a plastic gun known as ' @entity95 ' were downloaded within hours			2
the explosion of interest provoked the government into ordering the @entity100 - based company , @entity99 , who produced them to take them down			0
it used a 3d printer that cost £ 5,140 from the online auction site @entity106 to make the parts which , when assembled , create a working handgun			1
@entity99 ’s leader @entity109 was voted the 14th most dangerous person in the world in november			0
dangerous : @entity109 , of @entity99 , with the first completely 3d - printed handgun , the liberator but it is also hoped @entity115 will be used for the right reasons as well			0
for instance , the technology is already proven to be capable of making food			0
in november , @entity120 said it could use 3d printing on its models in the future			1
and last week , the world ’s first chocolate 3d printer was unveiled			0
a company called @entity127 has designed the machine that allows users to build any 3d shape out of chocolate - including their own face			2
customers can send an image of themselves through the company 's website and the machine creates a thick layered chocolate portrait for between £ 50 and £ 80			1
the machine , called @entity139 , works by squirting out chocolate according to computer instructions and allows a user to build any shape they like out of the sweet liquid			0
this photograph shows the world 's first chocolate 3d printer , unveiled last week the technology of @entity115 has been hailed as the future of manufacturing			1
it works by building up layer upon layer of material - typically plastic - to build complex solid objects the process , also called additive manufacturing , creates a three - dimensional solid object from a digital model			0
the feat is achieved by laying down layer upon layer of plastic			0
the layers are then joined together to create the final shape			0
the machine takes blueprints from computer aided designs and ' slices ' them into digital cross-sections that the machine uses as a guideline for printing			0
the process of addictive manufacturing has been in use on a large industrial scale since the early 1980s			0
however , since 2010 , an entire industry has sprung up around personal @entity115 , which are increasingly small , increasingly powerful and increasingly affordable			0
engineers hope 3d printing will begin an era of ' instant prototyping ' that will allow product developers to forge and tinker with prototypes quickly and inexpensively .			1

@entity7 said metal components were successfully used on the company 's *flight* from airfield in @entity12 , @entity13 , late last month
engineers are using 3d technology to design and produce parts which could cut @entity18 's maintenance and service bill by £ 1.2m over four years
3d printing has been hailed as the future of manufacturing , but is also controversial owing to the production of guns in the @entity62
