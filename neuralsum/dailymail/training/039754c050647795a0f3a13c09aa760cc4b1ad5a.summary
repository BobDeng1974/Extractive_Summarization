still the shock waves from @entity1 are shimmering through this @entity2			1
@entity4 5 , @entity5 1 : no matter how many times you read the statistic , it never makes a scrap of sense			1
the finest team the modern game has seen were systematically dismantled by a @entity4 side whose best days had seemed behind them			1
‘ @entity14 ’ was the instant critical reaction			2
a cliche , certainly , yet it may well be true			2
and beatings rarely come more savage than that which the @entity30 handed out in the @entity32			2
the search for scapegoats began with the final whistle			2
@entity37 followers will readily recognise the process			0
the manager , @entity39 , has to go ; immediately if not sooner			1
true , his team had lost just eight of 85 matches before friday but that will not save him			1
and he can take with him his hapless goalkeeper @entity43 , the ancient midfielders @entity44 and @entity46 and the entire back four			0
as for @entity48 , how did he get here anyway ? time to go ? @entity39 has only lost just nine of 86 matches as @entity5 coach carnage reigns			1
it appears that @entity54 had a feeling that something like this might happen , which is why he abdicated the other day			0
had he opted to hang around , he would surely have become another casualty			0
but before axes flash and blood is spilled , we might remember just what @entity5 have meant to the game			1
between 2008 - 2012 , they became champions of @entity66 , world champions and @entity69 champions once again , when they scored four unanswered goals against @entity71 in one of the most accomplished performances a major final has ever produced			1
yet recitation of the bald facts can not convey the poise , the daring , the imagination , the sheer beauty of this extraordinary football team			2
when they were at their best they expanded our notions of how the game might be played			0
running riot : @entity4 forward @entity89 ( left ) scored twice in their @entity91 drubbing of @entity5 on friday they took chances and accepted the consequences when their plans proved unfruitful			1
they knew that the game is infinitely better than bloodless pragmatists would have us believe and they clung to their expansive creed			0
they never could understand the @entity37 obsession with physical contact			0
@entity104 , once of @entity105 and now of @entity106 , expressed his feelings succinctly : ‘ i just do n’t understand football in those terms			2
@entity110 is a last resort and you will need it , but it is n’t a quality to aspire to			0
it ’s more important to construct a good team , to know how you are going to play , how to read the match			0
you have to truly understand the game			0
past it ? @entity5 captain @entity43 ' place in the team is under review after conceding five vs @entity4 ‘ from a @entity126 perspective , what matters is the ball ; possession of it , knowing what to do with it and when			1
technique is vital and intelligence is fundamental			0
’ there are tactical minds in @entity37 who will suggest that @entity104 might have flung a tackle or two at @entity4 in @entity1			1
why , there are pundits in @entity5 who are probably calling for his head at this very moment			1
but his argument is a lucid exposition of a philosophy which brought his country so many prizes and so many more admirers			0
false hope : @entity104 put @entity5 ahead with a first - half penalty against @entity4 at @entity32 of course , the @entity30 can boast a similarly excellent tradition of producing thinking footballers			1
certainly this @entity2 will be enhanced by their extended presence			1
yet the thoughts of many will be with the team that imploded so dramatically on friday			2
they lost their opening @entity2 match last time , before twinkling through to the trophy , but that was quite different ; a defeat rather than a disaster			1
best : @entity5 are the defending @entity2 champions ( pictured ) and double @entity168 holders if they discover even a smidgeon of their old form , they can surely qualify second in their group			1
but they must be feeling like the golfer who shoots 90 in the first round of an @entity179 ; his task is not impossible but nobody is backing his chances			0
for this generation of @entity126 footballers , it may never be a glad , confident morning again			0
if so , there must be consolation in the memories			0
for they endowed their sport with grace and style and , that inescapable word , beauty			2
they did the game some service and for that we should all be thankful .			0

@entity5 lost 5 - 1 to @entity4 in their @entity201 opener on friday
@entity39 has lost just nine of 86 matches as @entity5 coach
between 2008 - 2012 @entity5 won two @entity206 and a @entity2
@entity5 's style of possession football should be admired not *condemned*
