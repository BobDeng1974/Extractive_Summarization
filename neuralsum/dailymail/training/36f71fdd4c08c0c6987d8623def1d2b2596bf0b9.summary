the @entity0 are denying a report that claimed they knew about @entity3 's violent domestic assault hours after the incident occurred , and then pleaded with @entity6 commissioner @entity5 to go easy on the wife - beater , in a lengthy statement released earlier today			1
@entity0 owner @entity9 and members of the team are refuting 15 of the claims made in a recent @entity14 report in the eight - page statement , which is addressed to fans of the team			1
@entity9 also states that those who spoke with @entity14 's @entity19 were ' sources [ who ] work for @entity3 , ' and that much of the information they gave was ' manufactured			2
@entity14 reported last week that the @entity0 head of security @entity44 was told about the incident , and video , involving @entity3 and his then - fianc√©e @entity48 by a local police officer just hours after it happened , and then immediately described the event in detail to team executives			1
they also said these claims had been corroborated by team officials , current and former league officials , @entity6 @entity54 representatives and associates , and advisers and friends of @entity3			1
in their statement released today , the @entity0 disputed all of these facts			2
@entity44 said that he did not see the tape , and actually had to ask the @entity65 for a copy days after the incident			0
after they refused to send him a tape , one officer did describe to him the events happening in the elevator , but not as they were later seen when the tape was released to the public earlier this month			0
' as he described it , @entity35 appeared to initiate the altercation , but they both spit at and struck each other , resulting in @entity35 falling and hitting her head against the wall railing , ' said @entity44			0
' the officer could not tell from the video whether @entity3 slapped or punched her , but @entity3 told me very clearly that he did not punch her			0
' denied : @entity9 ( second from left ) also shot down claims he asked @entity6 commissioner @entity5 ( second from right , presenting @entity9 with the @entity86 in 2013 ) to go easy on @entity3 following the incident they next took on claims that @entity5 went easy on @entity3 as a favor to his close friend @entity9			1
' i did not ask @entity5 to give @entity3 no more than a two - game suspension , ' said @entity9			1
' i did not make any request for a " favor " or any particular outcome			0
' he then stated of his relationship with @entity5 , ' the two of us have spent very little time together - as i recall , one round of golf and one dinner several years ago			0
' he did however admit that team executives did fail when they did not push harder to get a copy of the tape			0
later in the day , during a news conference , @entity9 said , " the majority of the sources [ from the report ] are people that work for @entity3			2
almost everything in there is anonymous , but it 's clear from the subject matter that it 's @entity3 's attorney , it 's @entity3 's agent , it 's @entity3 's friends			1
' according to @entity14 , he then said that a significant amount of the information in the story was ' manufactured ' by members of @entity3 's camp			0
@entity123 , @entity14 's vice president of communications , went on @entity124 this afternoon following the @entity0 statement and @entity9 's news conference to say , ' we stand by our reporting			2

the @entity0 released a statement earlier today that refuted 15 of the claims made in a report about their handing of @entity3 's domestic assault incident
@entity0 owner @entity9 is also claiming that friends of @entity3 are ' manufacturing ' stories to get him reinstated
one of the claims being refuted is that @entity0 head of security @entity44 knew about the incident hours after it happened , which he denies
they are also denying they ever asked @entity6 commissioner @entity5 to be *lenient* when *deciding* on a punishment for @entity3
