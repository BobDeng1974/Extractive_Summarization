searching for a medieval king who had been lost for 527 years always looked like a long shot			0
in a discovery worthy of a @entity4 film , however , archaeologists yesterday announced they had unearthed what appear to be the remains of @entity8 using historic maps , they traced a friary where he was rumoured to have been buried after being killed in battle – underneath a social services department car park in @entity15			1
his injuries – a metal arrowhead embedded in his back , and a severe blow to the head – are consistent with the king 's death at the @entity34 in 1485			1
even more persuasive is the fact that the man has a severely curved spine ; @entity8 was famously nicknamed @entity38			1
the revelation that the skeleton , exhumed on september 4 , had severe scoliosis provoked a gasp at the packed press conference in @entity15 's @entity46 - era @entity45 building yesterday			2
he was not a hunchback , the archaeologists said , but his right shoulder was higher than his left – consistent with accounts of @entity8 's appearance			1
as any scholar of @entity56 will know , the king was famously ridiculed as a hunchback in the @entity56 's play , described as ' rudely stamp 'd , deformed , unfinish 'd '			0
the final resting place of @entity8 ? a body matching his description was found here buried in a shroud experts stress that the remains must be subjected to rigorous dna testing , to be undertaken over the next three months , to be sure if it is him			1
but they say the discovery is a potentially ' historic moment '			0
@entity73 , of @entity74 , said : ' this search has at times resembled a @entity78 novel in its twists and turns			0
' we have all been witness to a powerful and historic story unfolding before our eyes			0
' @entity85 , a 16th generation relation of @entity8 gives a dna mouth swab at @entity88 , @entity15			1
his dna will be used to determine whether the skeleton found is @entity8 @entity8 , the last monarch of the @entity91 family , ruled for only two years before dying in battle in 1485 when he was 32			1
it marked the end of the @entity95 and the victory of @entity46 , the first of the new dynasty			0
under the new regime , @entity8 was portrayed as a hunchback and a power - mad child - killer said to have slaughtered his two young nephews to seize the throne			1

archaeologists have found a skeleton they believe could be the remains of @entity8 , the tyrant king			1
it has an arrow in its back and a curved spine , a condition believed to have affected the monarch			2
closer and closer : fragments of what could be the east end window of the church the earliest surviving portrait of @entity8 in @entity121			1
archaeologists are hoping to find his grave under a council car park in @entity15			0
historians say that the find could help settle a five - century - long controversy over whether the king was the villain of legend , or a victim of malicious propaganda			0
@entity8 was thought to be buried at @entity106 , a @entity106 friary destroyed during @entity134 's @entity133 , but it was later claimed his body was thrown into a river			1
in the early 1600s the site of @entity106 was bought by the mayor of @entity15 , @entity141 @entity140 , and used as his garden			0
in 1612 @entity143 , father of the famous architect , recorded seeing a 3ft stone pillar in the garden inscribed : ' here lies the body of @entity8 , sometime @entity8 of @entity148			1
' the site was bought by @entity150 in 1914			0
lead archaeologist @entity151 said : ' we were very lucky it was a car park , and the remains , at the entrance to the choir , were just under the trench we dug , when there were several buildings at the friary			0
' he 's a prime candidate			0
i 'd be very surprised if someone else was buried at this same spot with critical injuries			2
' the university intends for the body , if it is proven to be @entity8 , to be buried in the city 's cathedral			1
as for the social workers , the academics said , it will be ' quite some time ' before they get their car park back			2
a lead window came ( a section of leading that supports stained glass windows from the @entity106 church a depiction of the carnage during the @entity34 by 18th century painter @entity180 ( 1740 - 1812 ) the @entity34 was fought on the morning of august 22 , 1485 , and marked the end of the @entity95 , the 30 - year civil war between the houses of @entity184 and @entity185			0
one of the most important clashes in @entity148 history , it saw the death of @entity8 , ushered in the @entity46 dynasty and gave @entity56 one of his best known quotations			1
the leading role has been played by @entity194 and sir @entity195 , and the battle has also been immortalised in many artworks			0
the battle marked the final confrontation between the @entity184 king @entity8 and his challenger @entity46 , @entity202 and @entity203			1
the seeds of @entity8 's downfall were sown when he seized the throne from his 12 - year - old nephew @entity207 in 1483			1
support for the monarch was further diminished when @entity207 and his younger brother disappeared and @entity8 was involved in the death of his wife			2
@entity46 laid claim to the throne from across the @entity215			0
following an unsuccessful attempt to invade @entity148 from his base in @entity218 , @entity46 arrived on the coast of @entity220 on august 1 , 1485			0
gathering support as he marched inland , @entity8 hurriedly mustered troops and intercepted @entity46 's army south of @entity224 in @entity225			2
after @entity8 's death on the battlefield his rival was crowned @entity46 and became the first @entity148 monarch of the @entity46 dynasty , which lasted until 1603 .			2
