by @entity0 a taxi driver who killed a 17 - year - old girl while driving down the wrong side of the road had been given a cab licence by the council despite having been banned from driving nine times before			1
@entity8 , 40 , was overtaking a car in @entity10 , when he ran down @entity11 , 17 , who was crossing the road on her way home from college			1
she was hurled 65ft by the impact , suffered multiple fractures and brain trauma			0
after five days in hospital she died of her injuries			0
mown down : @entity8 , 40 , ( left ) ran down 17 - year - old @entity11 , right , as she walked home from college in @entity10 after a trial @entity8 was convicted of causing death by dangerous driving and was jailed for seven years			1
but now miss @entity11 's family has taken the council to task for approving his licence despite the despite his string of previous convictions			1
it emerged he had been given a @entity34 licence by the council just days before the smash			1
his previous convictions totalled eight for driving while disqualified , two for dangerous driving , 10 for theft of a motor vehicle and five for driving with no insurance			1
injuries : miss @entity11 , pictured above , suffered serious fractures and brain trauma			1
she was taken to hospital but died five days later miss @entity11 's parents , @entity44 and @entity45 , said : ' we are very saddened by the response of @entity48 to the issue of taxi licences			1
' we think they know they have done wrong but wo n’t admit it			0
it would be nice to hear them say that they have made a mistake			0
' @entity8 has been given chance after chance			1
why was this person even on the road ? we truly believe that he will do the same again when he gets out			2
' miss @entity11 was mown down by @entity8 ’s @entity61 , which swerved and accelerated to get past a @entity62 on september 17 last year			1
he was off duty at the time			0
@entity65 @entity64 heard the teenager was ‘ like a rabbit in the headlights ’ when @entity8 smashed into her , throwing her into the air before she landed on her head 20m away			2
@entity8 admitted causing death by careless driving , but denied causing @entity11 ’s death by dangerous driving , but was found guilty by a jury			1
@entity48 defended itself by saying its regulatory committee was following guidance from central government			2
grieving : @entity80 , @entity11 's father , has criticised @entity48 for giving @entity8 his taxi licence the @entity82 only suggests taxi licence applicants be ‘ free of driving or motoring convictions for a period of between one to three years ’ , which would not have covered @entity8 's previous convictions , which were all more than a decade old			1
mr and mrs @entity11 have asked to meet the council 's leader , @entity90 , and are campaigning alongside victim 's charity @entity92 to secure tougher sentences			1
mr @entity80 , who wants to see sentences starting from 10 years and driving bans starting on release from jail , said : ' you read about things like this all the time , but until it happens to you , you ca n’t imagine it			2
' it ’s just horrific			0
it ’s like we are in this bubble			0
it ’s the likes of us that suffer , law - abiding citizens			2
we ’ve been driving for 50 years between us , not having got a single point and something like this happens , it does seem unfair			2
' it wo n’t bring @entity11 back , but there has to be a deterrent			2
driving bans start when a prison sentence starts , it ’s just not common sense			0
' there were many thousands of lives lost like this before this happened to us , and until something is done , there will sadly be many more thousands			0
' but it all seems to be falling on deaf ears			0
' speaking earlier this month , @entity48 leader @entity90 defended the decision to issue @entity8 ’s licence			1
he said : ' that decision was made in line with @entity82 advice and guidance that is provided by that department and the government			0
' i do n’t think we have the authority to look at the issue anyway			0
' but a @entity82 spokesman said : ' it is for individual licensing authorities to reach their own decisions both on overall policies and on individual licensing matters			0
' ' this guidance is intended to assist licensing authorities but it is only guidance and decisions on any matters remain a matter for the authority concerned			0
