@entity0 has been a magnificent leader of @entity1 through good times and hard and has striven mightily for @entity3 in the teeth of adversity			1
in terms of one - clubmanship this exemplary footballer stands just below sir @entity8 , the greatest of all @entity10 players who devoted his lifetime to @entity12			1
when his country called , @entity0 never failed to answer with every sinew and fibre of his being			2
@entity0 will head west this summer – not quite into the sunset just yet but as distant as @entity51 – as a distinguished ambassador for this , the mother country of the world game			1
@entity1 will spend the intervening months in celebration of one of their finest , then go into mourning at his departure			2
@entity10 football at large will share in the nostalgia			2
but the placing of @entity0 in the history of our national game is more complicated than this immediate sense of loss			2
however moderate the strength of the @entity1 and @entity3 teams he has graced , the poignant reality is that he falls tantalisingly just short of the greatest , even in the pantheon of midfield			1
the @entity31 miracle - worker of @entity76 ought to have delivered more across the spectrum of the domestic game			0
in part that was because he stayed true to @entity1 while others , his peer @entity82 among them , sought fame through transfer			2
@entity0 , pictured celebrating against @entity86 last season , almost helped the @entity88 to the @entity22 title @entity0 ( left ) , pictured in action against @entity91 at the @entity92 , retired from @entity3 duty last summer one - club men are unlikely to harvest as many trophies			1
in their honesty – and @entity0 has a heart as big as the @entity98 - they also end up trying too hard , endeavouring to do too much in the context of their team			2
as he did at times with @entity3			0
the bizarre failure of any @entity3 manager to effectively harness @entity0 and @entity82 into a midfield partnership potentially powerful enough to lift at least a @entity106 was rooted in the end in @entity0 ’s reluctance to be confined mostly to the anchor - man role			1
that would have been the natural balancing act with @entity82 ’s more prolific goalscoring but @entity0 always felt he had more to give and at times over-reached himself			0
then @entity1 manager @entity114 ( right ) holds aloft the @entity31 trophy with @entity0 in 2005 @entity0 lifts the @entity25 in may 2006 after a dramatic win against @entity117 at the @entity118 that loss of footing against @entity121 which caused @entity1 to stumble so fatefully on the threshold of last season ’s @entity22 title should not be held against the captain without whom they would never have got that close			1
the most profound loss was his own , condemning him never to win that championship he so richly deserved			0
but in a symbolic sense that slip puts into a freeze - frame the reason why he comes no higher than tenth in this list of the greatest @entity10 midfielders of all time which , to @entity1 chagrin no doubt , is topped by four of @entity139 ’s finest : 1 ) sir @entity140 @entity92 winner extraordinaire and still this country ’s leading goalscorer @entity139 and @entity3 legend sir @entity140 ( right ) in action against @entity146 in 1968 2 ) @entity147 @entity148 for both @entity139 and @entity3			1
3 ) @entity149 rated by @entity150 as greater than himself and may well have proved him right but for his premature death among other @entity153 in the @entity155 air disaster			0
4 ) @entity156 the most deft feet to be allied to a computer of a brain in the modern era			0
@entity156 enjoyed an illustrious career with @entity139 before hanging up his boots in 2013 5 ) @entity162 the sublime passer who invented , with @entity86 and @entity3 , the diagonal cross-field ball behind the full back and in so doing became this country ’s first £ 100 - a - week footballer			0
6 ) @entity168 the genius of this age , albeit ultimately the self - destructor of his own magical talent			0
7 ) @entity174 the @entity175 of @entity176 who would have won many more trophies with his club and played dozen more games for @entity3 had he not spent @entity183 fighting for his country			1
@entity168 ( right ) , pictured in action for @entity186 against @entity139 , was a magician with the ball 8 ) @entity188 the @entity190 ball conjuror who was the darling of the north - east			0
9 ) @entity82 the engine , the vision but above all more goals than many of the most renowned strikers have mustered			0
10 ) @entity0 see above			1
@entity82 ( centre ) has been a pivotal figure for @entity200 this season after leaving @entity121			0

@entity0 has announced he will leave @entity1 this summer
he has made 695 appearances and won 10 trophies for the @entity88
@entity0 makes @entity208 's list of the 10 greatest @entity10 midfielders
but failures with @entity1 and @entity3 leave him far from no 1 spot
