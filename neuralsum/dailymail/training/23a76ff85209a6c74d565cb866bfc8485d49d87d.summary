by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 04:12 est , 20 february 2014 @entity3 : 06:35 est , 20 february 2014 cases of seasonal flu have fallen to a record low in @entity7 - and the dismal wet weather may be to blame			1
only 3.1 per cent of people visited a gp with flu - like symptoms in the first week of february this year , according to @entity12 â€“ less than a tenth of the number expected			1
figures show the virus has struggled to rise beyond summer levels over the last few months			0
fall : only 3.1 per cent of people visited a gp with flu - like symptoms in the first week of february this year			1
this is less than a tenth of the number who would usually have sought treatment			1
( the large spike in 2010/11 is connected with swine flu ) one theory is that the wettest winter on record has kept people away from public spaces , while mild temperatures have boosted immune systems , resulting in fewer opportunities for germs to spread			1
@entity35 generally peaks before @entity36 , especially in an epidemic year , but this winter the number of people suffering from the virus was comparable with a typical june , july and august			1
although some years see a significant spike in cases in late february , this is rare			2
the number of cases generally falls as the days get longer , making it highly likely this winter will break all records			0
it 's not only flu that is on the decline - medical treatment for respiratory illness in general is predicted hit record lows by the end of winter			1
the key factor in the improvement in respiratory health is thought to be a decline in smoking			0
tis the season : flu and other respiratory illnesses peak in the winter months			0
graph shows the dramatically lower number being reported by @entity63 this year flu symptoms include the sudden onset of fever , a cough with a sore throat , and aching muscles and joints			1
it is advised that if you are otherwise healthy and are suffering from flu , you should stay at home , rest , drink plenty of fluids and take pain relievers such as paracetamol			0
children under 16 should not take any medication containing aspirin			0
although we still see flu epidemics in @entity7 , news of the record low follows 40 years of continual decline in the impact of the virus			2
better hygiene , less pollution and increasing numbers of people willing to self - medicate are reasons put forward by experts , but the truth is nobody knows for certain why respiratory infections are falling			2
professor @entity100 , a flu expert at @entity12 , told the @entity102 : ' i suspect we are seeing a real reduction in flu , but whether it is on the scale of the gp consultation data is a moot point			1
' ' there has been a change in behavior among patients , with more treating themselves at home instead of going to the gp			0
even if the prevalence of flu had not changed that would lead to a fall in consultations			0
' got the bug : although we still see flu epidemics in @entity7 , news of the record low follows 40 years of continual decline in the impact of the virus another reason put forward for the decline is an increase in vaccinations after the 2009 swine flu pandemic left 474 people dead			1
the picture is a stark contrast to last year			0
last january doctors reported a massive increase in cases of the potentially deadly virus			0
health experts revealed that the number of people visiting their gps had increased by almost 50 per cent in two weeks			2
it came as the @entity7 was recovering from the worst norovirus outbreak in years - with 1.1million people struck down by the winter vomiting bug			2
and gp consultations soared in the winter of 2010/11 due to swine flu			2
the condition , which peaked in july 2009 , caused over 1,000 deaths .			0

only 3.1 *%* of people visited a gp with flu - like symptoms in early february
this is less than a tenth of the number expected to have sought treatment
@entity165 weather and high temperatures may have contributed to the decline
but @entity12 says may also be that fewer people saw their gp
