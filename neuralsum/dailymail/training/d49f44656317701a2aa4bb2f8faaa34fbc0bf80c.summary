by @entity1 reporter published : 17:39 est , 5 february 2014 @entity3 : 19:16 est , 5 february 2014 charge : @entity4 has been charged with 10 years probation after falsifying a military record and being married to two women at once a man who claimed touted his @entity9 and wore military medals has plead guilty to impersonating a public servant			1
@entity4 , 57 , spent years living in @entity12 , @entity13 pretending to be a general but he has now been sentenced to five years ’ probation for the crime			1
that was n't the only deception that he is now in legal trouble for , as he has been charged with bigamy because he married one woman while still legally married to his estranged wife			1
the bigamy charge led to a second five - years of probation			1
' for the better part of 15 years , this defendant perfected the art of stolen valor , ' @entity24 assistant district attorney @entity23 said in a statement			0
' the lengths to which he was willing to go were prolific ; including wearing an officer ’s uniform and medals , as well as obtaining purple heart license plates , none of which was earned			0
he even wore a uniform to his marriage to a woman who believed him to be a military officer , and who was not aware of his other marriage			0
' considering those in uniform rarely ask for anything more than an occasional ‘ thank you , ’ @entity47 ’s actions are profoundly offensive			1
' according to the @entity52 , the first tip off to his fictitious personal history came when he offered the local police chief a tour of the @entity56 or @entity57			0
falsified : police have released photos of all of the fake documents that he used as props fooled : @entity4 wrote a fake obituary for his father , that general @entity65 commented on in 2011 officer @entity66 told the paper that he became suspicious because @entity4 reeked of cigarette smoke and was wearing an ill - fitting suit - two things that he thought were not befitting of such a high - ranking military man - prompting him to have some of his deputies look into his background			2
during the investigation , they were led to a fake online obituary for his father , who he claimed was a brigadier general at the time of his death but had in fact died more than two decades earlier never having served in the military			2
the ruse got passed general @entity65 - before resigning as @entity83 director amid extramarital affair allegations - who posted a message on the online obituary			2
@entity47 had completely fabricated not only his own military service record , but also his father 's who died in 1985 in @entity89 and not in 2011 in @entity90 as he wrote online			0
trickery : @entity4 married his second wife wearing the fake uniform ( left ) and was arrested in 2013 ( right ) that did n't stop @entity65 from offering his condolences to @entity4 and his then - fiancée @entity96			1

' thank you for your devout and faithful service to your country and for being a great man that leads by example			0
