by @entity0 published : 16:33 est , 9 august 2013 updated : 04:32 est , 25 september 2013 wind farms are being given around £ 30million a year in compensation to switch off or slow down their turbines because up to half the electricity they make is not needed			1
the cash , which comes from household bills , is paid when the @entity9 is unable to cope with the extra power produced during high winds or periods of low demand			1
known as ‘ balancing ’ , the arrangement is intended to compensate firms for energy they are unable to sell			1
waste of energy : last weekend up to 30 wind farms were paid more than three million to switch off their turbines but as the number of wind farms grows , the rates have hit record levels			1
firms are often paid more to turn off their giant turbines than for the electricity they produce			2
last weekend alone , householders handed £ 3.1million to energy firms for doing absolutely nothing as up to 30 wind farms were paid to switch off			1
the energy that could have been produced between friday and sunday would have powered up to 12,000 homes for a year			0
at one point , 40 per cent of all the wind energy set to be transmitted to the @entity9 was instead discarded , with the loss being blamed on maintenance work and breezy conditions			1
more than 95 per cent of payments to energy firms last saturday were to constrain energy produced by wind farms in @entity43 because there is limited network capacity between @entity43 and the rest of @entity47 creating a bottleneck of supply			1
weekend of waste : the energy that could have been produced over three days by the unused wind turbines would have powered up to 12,000 homes for a year the amount of wind energy discarded that day was almost twice as much as any other day on record , and cost families £ 1.9million			1
it was one of three days since may when wind farms were told to cut their output by more than a third			1
on june 30 , 46 per cent of energy from turbines was constrained			0
in total , payments worth almost £ 15million have been made this year – more than double the amount given in all of 2012			0
if the trend continues , the bill for the year will be around £ 30million			0
the figures only relate to giant turbines connected to the national distribution network , which make up 70 per cent of wind power			0
there are 5,000 giant turbines across the country , with another 1,000 planned			0
under @entity78 law , @entity47 ’s energy consumption from renewables needs to reach 15 per cent by 2020			0
payments known as ‘ forward trades ’ are also made to energy operators by the @entity9			1
this is where it agrees a payout in advance when the weather is expected to be stormy			0
in 2011 , £ 18.6million was paid in forward trades , although the figure is likely to be much lower this year			2
both payments make up about 1 per cent of a typical household ’s electricity spend , according to @entity9			2
a spokesman said costs were being driven down and the energy lost last weekend was ‘ slightly above average ’ owing to a combination of planned summer maintenance and high winds			2
but dr @entity99 , director of the @entity100 , said : ‘ the increasing volume of discarded wind energy presents a very strong case for revising @entity47 ’s ambitious commitment to @entity78 green targets			2
allowing subsidised generators to name their price to stop causing problems is a lousy solution			0
expensive energy : over the first six months of 2013 , energy companies have been paid almost £ 15million to slow down or turn off their wind turbines when the @entity9 has been unable to cope ‘ they are abusing their position by holding a pistol to the head of @entity116 and effectively saying we will not get off the grid unless you pay handsomely			1
@entity120 must do something about this			0
‘ it ’s already a record year and it ’s set to be a bumper one looking at the costs			0
we are on track to spend more on constraining wind than all of the previous years combined			0
and the problem just seems set to be getting worse			0
’ generous taxpayer - funded subsidies for wind farms are set to continue until at least 2020			1
onshore wind farms have been guaranteed at least £ 100 per megawatt hour , which is a unit of energy equal to using a million watts of power in one hour			1
this is double the current wholesale rate of £ 50			0
offshore wind farms receive £ 150			1
last weekend , two @entity43 windfarms charged £ 200 per megawatt hour to shut off			2
with greater wind production becoming available all the time , experts warn the overall cost of these payments is set to rise			0
energy analyst @entity143 said the spikes in constraint payments may be partly due to a lack of capacity , adding : ‘ @entity9 ’s infrastructure should be keeping pace with the building of wind farms , but that is not necessarily the case			1
’ a spokesman for @entity120 said : ‘ we have powers to take action against licensed generators if we consider they are gaining excessive benefit when constraints occur			0
’ @entity164 , of the wind industry body @entity166 , said : ‘ @entity167 is a flexible energy source that can be managed to fit our electricity demands by shutting down and powering up easier and quicker than other forms of energy			2
‘ that is partly why the @entity9 calls on wind developers to constrain their power			2
’ clarification a previous article reported that nearly half the electricity produced by wind farms is being discarded			1
we are happy to clarify that this is the discard rate on particular days rather than an overall figure .			0

wind farms paid millions when @entity9 is unable to use their energy
last weekend alone energy firms were paid £ 3.1million to switch off
