but last week @entity14 's dishwasher tablets beat the brand favourite finish in a consumer test			1
so which other own - label cleaning products are as good as the big names ? @entity19 pulled on her rubber gloves to find out ... @entity21 name : @entity22 , £ 1.50 for 530ml @entity23 : @entity24 , 59p for 500ml verdict : i put them through their paces with plates that had contained lasagne , greasy roasting trays and even the dog bowls			1
@entity2 offers the biggest bubbles , most effective wash and best value			0
a plain green liquid with no added frills such as perfume or moisturiser , which can mean more money has been spent on the cleaning ingredients themselves			1
in 2011 , which ? found that a 59p bottle of @entity24 will wash 11,750 plates			0
i could n't face testing this out to the last dish - but i did squirt @entity24 into a bowl of dishes next to an identical bowl of dishes and @entity22			1
eight hours later , the @entity24 bubbles were still there , beating fairy			0
@entity55 : 91p ( though you get 30ml more fairy ) also try : the @entity57 , 35 pence for 500ml - much cheaper but bubbles do n’t last quite as long			1
@entity21 name : @entity59 , £ 2 for 500ml @entity23 : @entity61 ’s antibacterial multi-surface spray , £ 1.35 for 500ml verdict : i swear by @entity10 , and found many own brands tended to foam when squirted , but the @entity61 's version squirted strongly to reach corners and cleaned muddy dog paws on skirting boards with ease			1
no smearing , no mess left - but a saving of £ 2.60 a month , if you get through a bottle a week like i do			1
@entity55 : 65p also try : @entity75 with @entity76 , £ 1.30 for 500ml - it just slightly lacks the @entity61 's power			1
budget buy : our writer could save £ 2.60 a month by switching to @entity61 's surface cleaner instead of @entity10 @entity21 name : finish @entity82 ( 30 pack ) , £ 12 @entity23 : @entity84 in 1 dishwasher tablets ( 30 pack ) , £ 3.50 verdict : the success of @entity14 's own - brand dishwasher tablets made headline news when they scooped a which ? @entity92 awards , beating my usual brand finish			1
i was stunned to find that @entity84 's all - in - 1 dishwasher tablets - which cost a quarter of the price of the market leaders - are also just as good			1
after a tough roast dinner , i could spot my reflection in every piece of silver cutlery , and even my glasses were shining - all for 11p per tablet			1
saving per item : £ 8.50 also try : @entity106 all - in - 1 dishwasher tablets , £ 3.99 for 40 - or 10p per wash			1
@entity21 name : lord @entity107 , £ 1.58 for 300ml @entity23 : @entity109 , 80p for 300ml verdict : big - name polish brands actually oil the wood , as well as polishing it - and none of the cheaper own brands manage to do this			1
but a friend who cleans for a famous museum in @entity117 , which boasts oak panelled walls and ornate antique wooden furniture swears by the @entity84 alternative			0
so i happily tried this 80p spray on my own maple kitchen units and oak dining table			0
there 's no smearing or sticky residue and it collects the dust well			1
use most days , and save your big name brands for a once a month super-shine			1
@entity55 : 78p also try : @entity133 , 80p for 250ml - same price as @entity84 , just slightly less in the can			2
ca n't tell the difference : @entity84 's toilet roll was as soft and strong as @entity138 @entity21 name : @entity139 ( four rolls ) £ 2.10 @entity23 : @entity141 ( four rolls ) £ 1.78 verdict : there ’s been a huge variation in quality of budget toilet paper in the past , and some - such as the co-operative own brand which is rough and cheap - are still really inferior			1
but others are working hard to match the market leaders			0
i ca n't tell the difference between my usual @entity138 and the cheaper @entity84 alternative , which is just as soft and strong			0
there are n't great savings here - in upping the quality of their budget roll , supermarkets have also increased the price			2
but the average person uses 30 toilet rolls a year , which means for a family of five , 150 rolls at year			0
so any saving - even just 32p per packet of four - is a bonus			2
@entity55 : 32 pence also try : @entity168 toilet roll ( 4 rolls ) £ 1.80 - also marvellous quality , and nobody will realise it is a cash - saving alternative to @entity138			2
@entity21 name : @entity172 , £ 1.25 for 750ml @entity23 : @entity173 , 55p for 750ml verdict : @entity14 won a @entity175 accreditation in 2013 for its bleach			1
famous brands like @entity11 are better at sticking to the sides of the toilet and sink , cleaning for longer			2
our own brand alternatives are slightly thinner , but clean almost as well			0
i get through a bottle of bleach a week cleaning up after a family of five - so if i switch to @entity14 i save £ 2.80 a month			1
a big saving for a slight difference in quality			2
@entity55 : 70p also try : @entity189 , 75p for 750ml — @entity133 is working hard on its own brands : the results are terrific			0
@entity21 name : @entity192 , £ 2.50 for 500ml @entity23 : @entity193 , 99p for 750ml verdict : i used @entity14 's cream to clean the bath and sink , but found it needs more rinsing than big brand name @entity199			1
i noticed there was a difference here — pay more , and you save yourself the extra work			0
all of our own budget brand cream cleaners required more elbow grease than the big name brands			2
a switch not worth making , in my opinion			0
saving per item : £ 1.51 ( though you get more @entity14 cleaner ) also try : @entity61 's cream cleaner , 80p for 750ml - a good budget alternative			1
scrubbing up well : @entity84 floor cleaner was almost as good as @entity199 @entity21 name : @entity216 , £ 2.50 for 1 litre @entity23 : @entity217 , 25p for 1 litre verdict : the arrival of two dogs has made my life - and my floor - very messy			1
i get through a bottle of floor cleaner each week , which costs me £ 52 a year for my usual brand , @entity199			2
but a simple switch to @entity84 ’s budget liquid cleaner gives me a massive 90 per cent saving			0
it was n't too runny and did n't smell cheap and nasty , and cleaned almost as well			0
@entity55 : 2.25p also try : @entity61 's @entity230 , £ 1.40 for 1 litre			2
@entity21 name : @entity231 , £ 12 for 4.25kg @entity23 : @entity232 ( @entity234 / 2 - in - 1/non bio ) , £ 6.19 for 4.875kg verdict : my favourite brand @entity237 costs 24p per wash - and is worth every penny			2
the colour does n't run and despite his sensitive skin , my son @entity240 does n't get a rash			0
i know from bitter experience that cheaper powders contain cheaper ingredients and are more likely to irritate skin			0
cheaper powder does n’t rinse as well and can leave white powder marks on your clothes in a coloured wash			0
but the fantastic @entity14 powder costs just 12p per wash and brings none of my children up in a rash			1
there 's no cheap after - smell , and when i tried it on muddy @entity260 kit on a 40 degree wash , it worked wonders			1
i run two washes a day - so this makes a massive difference to my housekeeping budget			2
saving per item : £ 5.81 also try : @entity268 ’s 2 - in - 1 @entity232 , £ 5 for 4kg - nice fragrance			2
great for towels and sheets			0
@entity21 name : @entity272 for colours £ 4.60 for 500g @entity274 : @entity61 ’s @entity273 £ 2.49 for 500g half price : @entity61 's stain remover does the job and is cheaper than @entity278 verdict : anybody with a football - playing husband and equally muddy dogs requires a jar of stain remover			1
vanish has always worked brilliantly for me , but with a hefty price tag of £ 4.60			0
i was thrilled to find that the cut - price @entity61 version , which is an astonishing £ 2.11 cheaper - performs just as well			2
saving per item : £ 2.11 also try : @entity290 lift , £ 2.39 for 2kg @entity21 name : @entity291 , £ 2.20 for 750ml @entity274 : @entity292 , £ 1.25 for 750ml verdict : big name brands such as @entity291 and @entity294 are thicker than the own brand alternatives			0
cheaper fabric conditioners do n't leave a long lasting smell , but they soften clothes just as well			0
i found myself using a tiny bit more - so in the long run , wo n't always pay			0
my pick of the own brands , though , is the @entity304 - a truly gorgeous and fresh smell			0
@entity55 : 95p also try : @entity306 & @entity307 , £ 1.20 for 750ml - @entity84 really have got their fragrances spot on			0
big savings : @entity0 found the cheaper products were worth buying quality : @entity312 , £ 2.98 for 750ml @entity274 : @entity61 's @entity313 with trigger spray , £ 1.25 for 500ml			1
verdict : be careful with cheaper spray cleaners			0
i squirted a @entity168 cleaner into the corner of the shower unit , and some of the foam flew out , bleaching my t - shirt in the process			0
@entity61 's own brand trigger bottles do n’t compromise on quality at all , cleaning beautifully - and this one was even cheaper than the equally impressive @entity84 version			1
@entity55 : £ 1.73 ( though you get 250ml more @entity199 ) also try : @entity328 , £ 1.50 for 750ml - no smears here , despite the price .			0
