when they bought the house , it was boarded up and in need of a total renovation			2
but @entity5 and @entity6 knew they were getting their potential dream home at a bargain – for it cost them just £ 1			1
now , after six months of hard work , they have a property worth £ 60,000			1
however the couple are not in a hurry to cash in – which is just as well because to get the two - bed mid-terrace for such a low price they had to agree not to sell it or rent it out for five years			1
through the keyhole : this is the refurbished interior of the house that @entity6 , 21 , and @entity5 , 22 , bought for just £ 1 @entity6 , 21 , and @entity5 , 22 , pictured left , are quids in after the property in @entity26 , pictured right , is now believed to be worth £ 60,000 car factory worker @entity27 , 22 , and his 21 - year - old fiancee bought the house in @entity26 under a regeneration scheme			1
the city council has been offering homes for less than the cost of two first - class stamps as it seeks to turn around swathes of its run - down or unwanted housing stock			2
buyers receive a £ 30,000 interest - free council loan to help cover the cost of essential repairs and refurbishment			1
the new homeowners agree to repay it over ten years – by which time the property will be worth far more than £ 30,000			1
photography student miss @entity6 , who is eight years younger than the average first - time buyer , said : ‘ it ’s a dream come true to have a house of our own			1
‘ we would never have been able to afford a house without the scheme			2
we had been engaged for four years but the prospect of us actually getting married would have been years away if we were saving for a house as well as a wedding			2
‘ it would have been years before we could have afforded a house alone			0
‘ my grandad heard about the scheme on tv and suggested we apply			0
we did n’t fit the criteria during the first round of the scheme			0
when it reopened a year and a half later , we decided to do whatever it took to get a place			0
' my mum and dad wanted us to get married before we got a house together but now they ’ve seen it even they agree that it was too good an opportunity to pass up			0
’ the couple has transformed the property , which was just a shell when they bought it , and turned it into a home that they can be proud of to qualify for the scheme , miss @entity6 had to get a regular part - time job as mr @entity5 is self - employed			1
since they moved in last september , they have transformed the property			0
they had to insulate the whole house and put up a supporting wall on the ground floor			0
the house had previously been a three - bed , but the pipes for the bathroom ran through the third bedroom , and the council deemed this unsafe			2
so the couple took a wall out upstairs and boxed off the pipes , making the bathroom bigger and giving the master bedroom a walk - in wardrobe			2
they put in a new kitchen and redecorated throughout			0
mr @entity5 and miss @entity6 now believe the house is worth around £ 60,000 as a similar but slightly smaller property in the same road – which was not part of the regeneration project – sold for £ 55,000			1
the £ 3million scheme , funded by the council and central government , was announced in 2012 following the success of similar projects in @entity114 and @entity115			1
it aims to create new communities in areas blighted by empty or boarded - up houses and a high turnover of tenants			0
so far more than 120 homes have been sold under the scheme and the @entity125 district of the city – the first area to be improved – has been nicknamed ‘ @entity128 ’			0
the council had to complete some structural work on the mid-terraced property before the couple could begin updating the inside the small but modern kitchen the couple has installed in their new home after buying the property for just £ 1 in @entity26 - on - @entity139 the couple told how they had to fight to get onto the popular council run scheme , which saw miss @entity6 take a third job working hard : the couple has said all the hours of work it took to get the two - bedroom property and then to transform it has been worth it to support the transformation , police have increased the number of patrols , while the @entity153 - run council has installed cctv to deter crime and improved other services			1
miss @entity6 said : ‘ although the area used to be really good it gradually got a bad reputation			1
but we have n’t had any problems			0
the streets are really quiet			0
our neighbour is great – he ’s an older gentleman from @entity164 who has lived here since the 1950s			0
‘ we ’re looking forward to it becoming a family area again where we can bring up children and people know their neighbours			0
to get it all sorted is lovely – though we are still working on the garden ! ’ miss @entity6 and mr @entity5 , who have been engaged for four years , have now completed the work on their dream home miss @entity6 said her parents had hoped she would marry mr @entity5 before they moved in together , but they understand this offer was just too good to miss a proud miss @entity6 said ' we would never have been able to afford a house without the scheme , ' as she showed off her new home the couple took out a £ 30,000 loan with the council for 10 years to carry out the work on the rundown property miss @entity6 said : ' we 're looking forward to it becoming a family area again where we can bring up children and people know their neighbours ' one of the streets in @entity26 where boarded up properties have been sold for just £ 1 in a bid by the city council to improve rundown areas ( file picture )			1

@entity6 and @entity5 bought their first home together in @entity26 for the bargain price of just £ 1
the young couple have spent the last four months doing up the terraced property and it is now worth £ 60,000
they bought the property together as part of @entity212 *'s* home ownership scheme
the council invested £ 30,000 in the two bedroom mid-terrace property that they will pay back over next 10 years
miss @entity6 , 21 , said they would never have been able to afford their own home without the council scheme
