by @entity0 published : 00:34 est , 23 july 2012 updated : 02:45 est , 23 july 2012 nine in 10 rapes and other sexual assaults go unreported to police because women lack confidence in the criminal justice system , @entity2 's chief prosecutor will say today			1
@entity10 , the @entity11 , is to reveal that convictions for rape have reached record levels but the true number of offences is far greater			1
he will say that while more than 300,000 women are sexually assaulted each year , only one in 10 victims of a serious offence reports it to the police			1
looking for improvement : @entity10 , the @entity11 , will admit that nine in 10 rapes and other serious sexual assaults are not reported to police campaigners have warned that the number of convictions is only the ' tip of an iceberg '			1
mr @entity10 , who heads the @entity32 ( @entity32 ) , will tell a gathering of criminal justice agencies and women 's groups : ' we now deliver justice for 15,000 more women each year than we did just four years ago			1
' and we do so within a different culture - one which challenges myths and stereotypes and should improve confidence in the criminal justice system			0
' but while more than 300,000 women are sexually assaulted each year , while only one in 10 women who experience serious sexual assault report it to the police , and while conviction rates remain lower for these attacks than for other crimes , none of us can afford to stop working to improve further			1
' the number of cases involving violence women and girls which have been prosecuted by the @entity32 has risen from 75,000 in 2007 - 08 to 91,000 in 2011 - 12			1
over the same period , the number of convictions rose from 52,000 to almost 67,000			1
silent : some women fail to report abuse because they lack confidence in the criminal justice system ( picture posed by model ) mr @entity10 is expected to say the rise can be partly explained by a ' cultural change ' in the way such cases are dealt with			1
he will say : ' the work of the service in recognising violence against women and girls as a unified , high - priority issue , championed at the most senior level nationally and in the areas , and addressed through new policies , training and the use of specialist staff , has delivered a cultural change			2
' cases are now judged entirely on the merits of the evidence : we have recognised that myths and stereotypes previously held have no place in our criminal justice system - and that we need to tackle them head on			0
' mr @entity10 is chairing a case review panel to explore the handling of the prosecutions in @entity96 of nine @entity98 men , mainly of @entity100 origin , who were found guilty of plying girls as young as 13 with drink and drugs and raping them			2
he will say : ' violence against women and girls is not a race issue , but what we do recognise is that the manifestation of abuse varies across communities and we have to discuss the issues and possible solutions together with those communities			2
' speaking on @entity116 's today programme , mr @entity10 added : ' i have asked for all our cases involving child exploitation to be looked at so we get a proper picture of all sorts of cases in their proper circumstances			1
' asked about recent child sex grooming case in @entity96 in which a gang of @entity128 men were jailed , he said : ' for my part i 'm less concerned about ethnic backgrounds			0
if you focus on the victim it becomes clear that these are often very vulnerable groups of individuals			0
' why is it that these people presented as victims			0
why was it that they were not taken as seriously as they should have been			0
' rapist : @entity143 , who led a child sex exploitation ring in @entity96			0
@entity10 is chairing a review of the case mr @entity10 is also expected to talk about the issue of teenage relationship abuse , where there remains a low volume of prosecutions and explain how a @entity152 he is hosting will look at six recent cases and work out recommendations			2
he will mention female genital mutilation , for which there have been no prosecutions			0
' i am determined that we will find a way to bring offenders to account , ' he will say			0
@entity164 , chief executive of domestic violence charity refuge , said : ' refuge welcomes the recent @entity32 report which shows that the number of perpetrators being prosecuted for domestic violence has increased to 91,466 per year			1
' refuge has been campaigning for four decades to ensure that women and children are given the protection and justice they deserve and we commend the @entity32 for their efforts			0
' whilst we recognise these efforts are a step in the right direction , there is no room for complacency			0
' refuge remains concerned that the numbers of perpetrators prosecuted and subsequently convicted represents the tip of an iceberg			0
' in @entity190 alone , there were almost 52,000 domestic violence offences recorded in one year , so the 66,860 successfully prosecuted nationally , barely scratches the surface			2

@entity2 's chief prosecutor , @entity10 , will say rape convictions have reached a record high but the true number of offences is much greater
more than 300,000 women a year are sexually assaulted
