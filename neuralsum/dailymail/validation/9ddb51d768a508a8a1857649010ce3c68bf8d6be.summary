@entity0 : a complicated life by @entity2 the exhilarating finale of a musical called @entity6 currently offers one of the great nightly spectacles in @entity10 ’s so - called ‘ theatreland ’ , as hundreds of mostly middle - aged punters leap or , in some cases , creak to their feet , jigging and jiving to the music of @entity15			1
just a few weeks ago , i was one of them , and resolved as i left to learn more about the singular life of @entity0 , the band ’s brilliant but melancholic frontman , who wrote such timelessly wonderful hits as @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 and , indeed , @entity6			1
@entity0 ( pictured ) is the brilliant , but sometimes melancholic , frontman of @entity15 well , @entity2 ’s monumental biography has filled all the gaps in my knowledge of one of the men who made the @entity30 swing ( while simultaneously lampooning the @entity31 with his mickey - take of @entity34 dandies , @entity32 )			1
gloriously rousing though it is , the stage show hardly does justice to the enigma that is @entity0			1
mercurial , introspective , sometimes cruel and spectacularly , almost sociopathically , mean with money , but also sensitive , principled and capable of great kindness , @entity0 is above all one of the creative geniuses of our age			1
those who are or have been close to him , including his brother @entity45 and the singer @entity46 ( the mother of one of his four daughters ) , might not always echo the sentiment , but we are lucky to have him			2
@entity0 was born in 1944 in @entity52 , @entity10 , on the night of an air raid			1
it was a suitably explosive beginning			2
he was the seventh child in a boisterous , tight - knit , working - class family but , more significantly , the first son			2
one of the pivotal episodes in shaping his complex personality came before he was three years old , when baby @entity61 arrived , rudely undermining his status			2
much later , @entity45 ’s musicianship would also be central to the success of @entity15 , but he was resented by @entity0 from day one			1
indeed , @entity61 still remembers a childhood mock fight in which he thought he ’d accidentally knocked his older brother unconscious			2
he bent over him , whispering , ‘ are you ok ? ’ , only for @entity0 to spring up and punch him hard in the face			1
‘ i felt the pleasure that i ’d knocked him over , then concern that i ’d hurt him , ’ says @entity45 now , ‘ but all he really wanted was to get back at me			2
it ’s symbolic of our whole relationship , really			2
’ while @entity45 grew up happy and outgoing , @entity0 was troubled and solitary and was even sent to a child therapist , which ca n’t have been usual in working - class @entity10 during the @entity81			1
the sudden death of much - loved older sister @entity84 compounded his torment			2
but he found refuge in music , especially in the records of the @entity90 blues singer @entity89 , a discovery he credits with changing his life			0
with @entity45 , and schoolfriends @entity93 and @entity95 , he formed the @entity96			0
he auditioned a cocky boy from the year below him at @entity98 , but the lad ’s voice was so raspy that @entity102 ’s mother would n’t let them rehearse in her house			0
while young @entity105 forged his own path towards superstardom , the @entity96 , shedding @entity102 and adding drummer @entity106 , mutated into the @entity107 , the @entity108 and , finally , @entity15			1
pop group ' @entity15 ' ( pictured in 1964 ) left to right : @entity93 , @entity0 , @entity106 and @entity112 there are various contradictory explanations for the famous name , but the best guess is simply that ‘ kinky ’ was a fashionable adjective in the early @entity31			1
@entity2 implies that inspiration may even have struck thanks to a @entity121 cartoon of a girl praying beside her bed , captioned : ‘ @entity124 is a @entity125 , failing that , a pair of kinky boots			0
’ similarly uncertain are the precise origins of @entity15 ’s first hit , @entity22 , in the summer of 1964			1
but it reached number one and made @entity0 a star			1
not that success tempered his extraordinary tight - fistedness			0
he would habitually hold open pub doors for his bandmates to enter — not out of politeness , but to ensure he was last to the bar			0
and the band ’s manager , @entity139 , was present on the day @entity0 ’s first wife , @entity141 , who he ’d met when she was a schoolgirl attending one of their gigs , pleaded with him , ‘ @entity145 , what about that coat ? ’ he replied , ‘ no , you ca n’t have it			1
it ’s a lot of money			0
’ she continued begging him , pointing out how bitterly cold it was outside , until finally he relented , and told their driver to take them to @entity157 ’s			0
she was n’t asking for a new coat			0
he just had n’t wanted to pay the dry - cleaning bill			0
the @entity96 , mutated into the @entity107 , the @entity108 and , finally , @entity15 ( pictured in 1964 ) @entity0 ’s parsimony is one of the reasons why the story of @entity15 is a tale of epic in - fighting , as well as marvellous music			1
but only one of the reasons			0
besides , he was merely a spectator at their most notorious scrap when , during a show in @entity173 in 1965 , his brother @entity170 at @entity171 , and @entity106 hit @entity45 with a cymbal so hard that many there thought they ’d witnessed a murder			0
four decades later , @entity0 himself was almost the victim of a murder , when he was shot in @entity180 while chasing a mugger who ’d stolen his then - girlfriend ’s handbag			1
it was yet another traumatic incident in what has been , to quote this book ’s barely adequate sub-title , a complicated life			0
but shining through the violence , the personality clashes , the litigation with former management , the volatile relationships with women , even a mental breakdown , are the songs — none of them more enduringly haunting than @entity21			1
@entity0 ( far left ) wrote timelessly wonderful hits such as @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity6 his voice might not be what it was , but @entity0 was the perfect choice , and it was the perfect song , to close the @entity203 three years ago			1
yet this book reveals it was , at first , tentatively titled @entity205 , and he intended it to represent the death of @entity208 , which he felt was presaged by the @entity125 moving away from their roots and buying big houses in @entity211 and @entity212			0
that was n’t for @entity0			2
he stayed in or near @entity52 and he ’s still there now , with wispier hair but the same familiar , gap - toothed smile , which we might never have known had he had his teeth capped one afternoon in 1964			0
he was actually sitting in the dentist ’s chair , the drill whirring , when he leapt up and left the room			0
if he was going to make it , he told himself , it would be through his songwriting , not his looks			0
it was a firm statement of artistic intent and still ‘ the most important decision i ’ve ever made ’ , insists the man who , happily for us , has never been a dedicated follower of anyone ’s fashion but his own .			0

@entity0 was the frontman of *iconic* band @entity15
he wrote hits such as @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23
he has been *heralded* as one of the creative geniuses of our age
