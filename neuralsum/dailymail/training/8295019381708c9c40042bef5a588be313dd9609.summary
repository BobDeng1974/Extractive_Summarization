@entity1 ' own in - house fan group has called on chief executive @entity2 and chairman @entity3 to come clean after it was revealed @entity5 is preparing to take out security on @entity7 and @entity8			1
the @entity10 owner is willing to hand the club a £ 10million loan but wants the club 's historic stadium and training ground as collateral			1
and he now has 35 days to agree terms after lodging documents with the @entity19 of @entity20 which prevent anyone else from using them as guarantees			0
@entity5 will offer @entity1 a £ 10m loan but wants to use @entity7 and @entity8 as collateral @entity5 's pursuit of the club has proved unpopular with the club 's fans the @entity31 - wealthy fans @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34 - have offered to increase their existing £ 5million loan offer if it keeps both properties out of @entity5 's grasp			1
but directors @entity2 and @entity3 are under pressure to spell out their plans			0
the @entity41 have already threatened legal action			0
now the @entity45 ( @entity46 ) - the club 's official supporter liaison group , set up by former ceo @entity47 - has told the board it will never back moves to mortgage off @entity7			1
their statement said : ' the @entity46 are today insisting on clarity from @entity1 chief executive officer @entity2 and chairman @entity3 following revelations that @entity7 and @entity8 could be used as security in return for additional funding			1
' @entity46 would like to state that we will never support any moves which could see @entity7 , or the training complex used in this manner			2
the @entity1 fan board has insisted that it will never back any plans to mortgage off @entity7 ' we have already requested information from mr @entity2 as to the @entity45 's intentions in regard to the @entity5 loan offer and so far the ceo has said : ' at this moment in time there has not been a deal done with anyone with regard to loaning the club funds			1
we are in talks with a number of parties and hopefully an announcement will be made shortly with this effect to the @entity77			0
' ' an announcement was subsequently made but it did not come close to clarifying the situation and that is why we are pushing for a meeting with the ceo and chairman			0
' we need a categoric assurance that our stadium , which is hugely symbolic , a monument to what this club means and which is also a place of treasured memories will never be used as security			0
' it is alarming that advance notices of security were lodged with the @entity95 of @entity20 on tuesday , january 13			0
' we must stress again that we would strongly oppose the securitisation of @entity7			2
the very notion fills us with dread and since @entity46 was brought into being to bridge the gap between supporters and the @entity45 we believe it is incumbent upon the directors to meet with us as a matter of urgency			2
' meanwhile , fan - ownership campaigners @entity1 first have contacted the club 's nominated advisor @entity108 to spell out their concerns			1
@entity7 is the third largest football stadium in @entity20 with a capacity of 50,987 @entity5 appointed his associate @entity2 ( right ) as chief executive of @entity1 in december they said in a statement : ' the @entity116 board have written to @entity118 's @entity117 to express some of the concerns that have been voiced to us by members over the last 24 hours			1
' first , we expressed our deep concern about a notice of intention to grant security being lodged over @entity7			2
' granting such a notice , at a time when shareholders have been assured that @entity118 are currently considering various proposals , seems to be providing the party in whose favour the notice has been granted with an unfair advantage whilst , at the same time , prejudicing the ability to advance discussions with other potential providers of funding			0
' we advised that we could n't see how that was in the best interests of shareholders and requested an urgent explanation			0
' secondly , we indicated that we had been inundated with requests from members to take every possible step to prevent security being granted over @entity7 and advised the @entity117 that we were completely opposed to any proposal which involves security being granted over @entity7 to a lender and that our concern would not be mitigated by any undertakings or covenants granted alongside that security			2
' we would call on every shareholder to contact @entity118 's @entity117 in similar terms to ensure the nomad is aware of the weight of shareholder opinion on this issue			0
' shareholders arrive at @entity7 in @entity160 , ahead of the 2014 @entity1 agm .			1

@entity164 fans are *incensed* over @entity5 's fans to use @entity7 as collateral
the @entity10 owner will offer @entity1 a £ 10m loan
@entity45 will not back any move to mortgage off @entity7
