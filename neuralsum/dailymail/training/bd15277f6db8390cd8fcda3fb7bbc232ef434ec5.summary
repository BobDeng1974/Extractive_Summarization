by @entity1 reporter published : 03:37 est , 1 february 2014 @entity3 : 18:55 est , 1 february 2014 baroness @entity4 has claimed she is being forced out of as chairman of schools watchdog @entity6 in a @entity8 move to oust non-tories from key posts			1
the @entity13 peer ’s contract , due to end this month , has not been renewed			1
she said last night : ‘ there is a determined effort from @entity16 that @entity18 supporters will be appointed to public bodies			2
’ a source close to @entity22 schools minister @entity21 said : ‘ the decision to get rid of @entity4 had absolutely nothing to do with her abilities and everything to do with @entity28 ’s desire to get his own people on board			1
’ @entity13 peer baroness @entity4 ( pictured with @entity32 ) currently chairs the schools inspectorate @entity6 , but has reportedly been told she will not be given a second three - year term at the watchdog a no 10 spokesman admitted that mr @entity28 had taken the decision , but denied that it was political			1
‘ this government appoints people on merit			2
for example , @entity4 herself , ’ he said			1
@entity44 was today accused of seeking to purge public bodies of officials who do not support the @entity18			1
speaking on @entity49 's today programme , she added : ' i am the latest of a fairly long list of people now who are @entity53 supporters who are not being re-appointed			1
' i think there is absolutely a pattern			1
' it was reported that @entity28 was keen to appoint a ' fresh face ' - despite the fact that @entity60 , a @entity13 peer , is a strong supporter of the @entity63 's free schools and academies			1
however , she insisted today that she had not fallen out with mr @entity28 and suggested that no 10 was behind the decision not to give her another three - year term			1
' one of the really important things about public appointments is that they are made on the basis of merit and they are seen to be transparently made , ' @entity60 said			0
' i think there is something going on in the centre that 's mitigating against that			0
' i think there is an absolutely determined effort from @entity16 that @entity18 supporters will be appointed to public bodies			0
although @entity60 is seen as a strong supporter of both mr @entity28 's free schools and academies programmes , it is believed the @entity63 wanted a fresh face in the post ' it has been a quiet , quiet drip			1
i 'm not talking about @entity13 people being replaced , i 'm talking about @entity53 supporters being replaced by @entity18 supporters			1
' there is a lot of concern about it			0
often they are people who have been working really well with their organisations and , indeed , with their host departments , so i do think this is coming from @entity16			0
' although @entity60 was once a close adviser to @entity99 , she was seen as being close to mr @entity28 and he has paid tribute to her ' tremendous contribution ' to the work of @entity6			0
the peer , whose current term is due to end this month , is expected to carry on until the autumn while a successor is found			1
the moves comes amid tensions between mr @entity28 and @entity6 - the chief inspector of education , sir @entity111 , was angered by media reports that there were plans to reform or even replace the organisation			2
mr @entity28 was forced to issue a statement voicing his full support for sir @entity28 and promising to dismiss any aides if they were found to be part of any ' dirty tricks ' campaign			0
paying tribute to @entity60 , he said : ' she has brought great knowledge and insight , leading the board strongly through a period of significant change , both managing the smooth transition when there were changes in chief inspector , and leading the reforms to the inspectorate and its work			2
' ' i hope that she continues to play an active role in helping to shape the education landscape to improve standards for all children and young people			0
' @entity60 told @entity141 : ' @entity6 plays a crucial role in delivering independent inspection that is trusted by the public and particularly by parents			2
' i am proud of helping lead @entity6 through a period of reform that has strengthened our inspections			0
' ' our tougher regime is driving improvements with more good schools and colleges than ever before			2
' there is also a renewed focus on raising expectations in all parts of the country and for all children , including the most disadvantaged			0
' baroness @entity4 of @entity162 - a former geography teacher and mother of two - joined the @entity13 in 1985			1
