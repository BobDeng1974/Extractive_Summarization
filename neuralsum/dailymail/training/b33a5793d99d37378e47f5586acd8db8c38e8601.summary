he ignored calls for him to apologise to his victim			2
in a defiant speech outside court @entity1 , who has called the case a celebrity witch - hunt , appeared to suggest the guilty verdict was the result of prosecution mud - slinging			1
he said : ‘ with millions of pounds of taxpayers ’ money , thousands of hours of police resources , the judge accepted today that the @entity21 had failed to prove their case against me – namely that i was a sexual predator			1
‘ while i am relieved i have been able to prove that i am not a sexual predator , i am mortified that i was convicted of one count			2
and it is of little comfort to me that i was acquitted of so many others			0
’ former @entity54 presenter @entity1 , who could have faced a maximum two - year jail sentence for indecent assault , was given a three - month sentence suspended for two years			1

' i was too paralysed with fear to confront my assailant but immediately told my boss			0
‘ i feel lucky , i was psychologically robust enough to deal with the distress , thanks largely to the support of my friends and colleagues			0
‘ i have coped by using humour as a defence mechanism			0
but remembering the incident still takes me back to feeling like a scared , vulnerable young woman			2
' being called a liar and fantasist and being forced to relive the events of the past has been painful			1
i was particularly horrified at the defendant ’s allegations that desire for attention or financial greed motivated me			0
‘ i have sought to preserve my anonymity and have no intention of claiming compensation now or in the future			0
i simply wanted to tell the truth and was prepared to go through this unpleasant process to that end			0
‘ i am grateful i have always been believed by those who know me , and the members of the jury also appreciated i was telling the truth			0
