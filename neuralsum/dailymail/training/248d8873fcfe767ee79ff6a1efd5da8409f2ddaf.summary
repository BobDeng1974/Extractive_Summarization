@entity1 columnist @entity0 analyses @entity3 's extra-time win against @entity4 in the @entity6 final , including @entity8 's performance , @entity9 's forgettable night and another midfield masterclass from @entity11			1
parking the bus ? not a chance the match was a real battle of styles			0
the @entity17 were happy to soak up the pressure , defend aggressively and play on the counter attack			0
they were not parking the bus , with @entity21 , @entity8 and @entity22 up front they always knew one flash could unlock their opponents			1
the @entity26 , on the other hand , were a mixture of tiki - taka and power , looking to score from a 30 - pass move or a corner			0
they dominated possession , but @entity4 often looked not far from a goal			1
@entity36 man : @entity37 ( left ) goes up for a header with @entity4 defender @entity39 ( right ) @entity4 looked more tired than their opponents			1
it could have been because they had a day less to prepare , were taken to extra time and penalties in the semi-final whereas the @entity26 cruised through against @entity46			0
it had a real impact on how the game played out and made for a thrilling match			0
@entity52 maestro : @entity53 ( left ) holds off the challenge of @entity55 ( right ) during the first half @entity9 has a real stunner @entity6 finals are the biggest stage of all and it creates nervy games			2
five of the last seven have been goalless at half - time and this one was no different			2
what a night to remember for @entity9 â€” if he can recall any of it			2
the 23 - year - old was called up for his first competitive start for @entity3 after @entity70 pulled out with a calf injury in the warm - up			1
@entity9 had made just two last - minute substitute appearances against @entity74 in the last 16 and @entity75 in the quarter - final			1
it was such a shame , then , that he took a blow to the face in the 20th minute as the full force of @entity39 ran through him when he was looking the other way and eventually had to come off after 32 minutes			0
he looked dazed and confused when he left the field with concussion			0
down and out : @entity3 midfielder @entity9 was forced off after suffering a head injury mascherano the middle man @entity11 has proven at this @entity6 that he is a midfielder and not a defender			1
why on earth do @entity87 play him as a centre back ? he is not tall enough for the position and it does not suit him			0
but when @entity11 is in midfield he is a different animal			1
man in the middle : @entity11 ( centre , circled ) even gave a team talk before extra time as @entity8 ( left , circled ) appeared to walk away as soon as the team loses the ball he slips into the defence , he can sense danger and he can deal with it			1
in the semi-final he made the tackle of the tournament against @entity107 , who looked set to score the goal which would have knocked @entity4 out , and he was a nuisance for @entity3 again			1
@entity52 engine : @entity4 's @entity11 ( right ) attempts to win the ball back from @entity112 ( left ) in midfield pain for @entity21 i would normally have put my life savings on @entity21 to score when he was handed a gift of a chance in the first half			1
after all the goals he has scored for @entity120 and @entity4 he looked certain to find the net			2
he had so much time when @entity53 headed the ball right into his path but he just snatched at it			0
it just goes to show what happens to players when they are under that much pressure			0
missed opportunity : @entity4 's @entity21 drags a shot wide despite being clean through on goal @entity8 saves best till last @entity8 had clearly stored up something extra for this final			1
he showed the pace and sharpness that he has lacked in the past few matches			0
he gave @entity138 a torrid time , picking the ball up on the right flank and dribbling with a spring in his step			0
@entity138 has been one of the standout defenders but @entity8 left him for dead in the first half with a rapid change of pace and was unlucky not to find a team - mate when he got to the byline			2
surrounded : @entity53 ( left ) and @entity112 ( right ) chase down @entity8 ( centre ) at the @entity150 @entity151 : @entity8 highlights			2

both @entity4 and @entity3 tried to win the game despite normal time ending 0 - 0
@entity9 earned his first start of the tournament but was forced off with a head injury early on
@entity11 was a rock in the middle of midfield for @entity4
@entity21 missed an *excellent* chance to give his country the lead
@entity8 looked dangerous against @entity170 defender @entity168
