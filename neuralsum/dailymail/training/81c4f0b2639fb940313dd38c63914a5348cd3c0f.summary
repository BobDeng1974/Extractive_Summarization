by @entity0 published : 05:55 est , 10 january 2014 updated : 09:23 est , 10 january 2014 a video game could be used to detect the early signs of alzheimer ’s disease , experts believe			2
it could also be used to track the progression of the disease and to measure the effectiveness of treatments			2
pharmaceutical giant @entity11 is working with a video game design company to test whether video games can detect cognitive differences in healthy elderly people who are at risk of dementia			0
a video game , which can be played on @entity19 and @entity20 , could be used to detect the early signs of alzheimer 's disease			2
it could also used to track the progression of the disease @entity24 says this is the first time a pharmaceutical company has tested the use of video games as a clinical tool for picking up the early signs of degenerative neurological diseases			2
as part of the trial , experts will evaluate 100 healthy elderly people both with and without amyloid in their brains			0
the game is designed to measure and improve the ability of patients to deal with distractions which impact their ability to pay attention , plan and make decisions			1
image shows ct scans of a brain with @entity48 's amyloid is thought to be the most likely cause of the damage that underpins alzheimer 's disease , meaning people with it are perceived to be at high risk , while those without it are at lower risk			1
the volunteers ’ cognitive abilities will be assessed at the start of the study and during one month of playing the game which is called project : @entity64 and which runs on iphones and @entity19			0
the game requires the volunteers to steer around a track while , at the same time , shooting road signs			1
the researchers hope to discover whether the game could be used to help identify early @entity48 ’s			0
the game is designed to measure and improve the ability of the participants to deal with distractions and interruptions which impact their ability to pay attention , plan and make decisions			1
such deficits are common symptoms of many degenerative diseases , such as @entity48 ’s , but also of conditions such as @entity84 , autism and depression			1
@entity87 , senior vice president and chief scientific officer of the @entity89 at @entity11 , said : ‘ a tool that enables cognitive monitoring for the selection and assessment of clinical trial patients has the potential to be an important advance in @entity48 ’s research and beyond			0
’ alzheimer 's disease is the most common form of dementia which is a general term for memory loss and loss of other intellectual abilities serious enough to interfere with daily life			0
there are estimated to be about 650,000 people in @entity107 with @entity48 's disease , most of whom are over the age of 65			1
there is currently no test to effectively diagnose alzheimer ’s disease – doctors have to make a diagnosis based on their assessment of the symptoms .			0

the game could also be used to monitor the effectiveness of treatments

designed to measure ability to deal with distractions which stop people paying attention , planning and making decisions
