triple trouble , from left : @entity13 , and @entity14 were welcomed by three sisters in the month of july , including two who were born about an hour apart close cousins : @entity17 ( left ) and @entity18 ( right ) were born on the same day , while baby @entity19 ( center ) was born earlier in the same month the trio says they did n't plan on getting pregnant at the same time			1

her younger sister , @entity25 , 21 , later asked her if she had a pregnancy test to spare			1
the sisters told their older sister , @entity29 , 25 , then asked if she was sad she was n't expecting , but she said no - because she was also pregnant			1
coincidence : @entity30 and husband @entity31 ( left ) welcomed their son on the same day as her sister @entity29 and her husband @entity35 ( right ) welcomed theirs due dates : the three sisters had n't planned to get pregnant at the same time @entity24 gave birth to her baby , @entity19 , on july 3			1

" ' the sisters were in rooms across the hall from each other , both feeling bad they could n't be with the other to provide support			2
nurses helped by keeping each up - to - date on the other 's contractions and the babies ' heart rates			0
' we could n't go really into each other 's room very much , but we would send pictures back and forth and text and ask how each other is doing , ' @entity14 told the @entity4			2
their mother was bouncing back and forth between the rooms as each went through the stages of labor , said dr. @entity78 , who delivered both babies			0
the fact that both babies came naturally , rather than being induced , made it even more remarkable , he said			2
it was something he had n't seen before in his 20 years as a doctor			2
' we are all kind of baffled that such a coincidental thing would occur , ' @entity78 said			0
