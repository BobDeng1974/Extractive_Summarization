the @entity8 is set to test the changes , which include more clearly labelling search results from its own services such as @entity12 , and showing searches from rival firms more prominently			1
the search giant hopes the move could settle a @entity18 antitrust investigation focusing on whether the internet giant is abusing its dominant position of online search and advertising markets			1

@entity1 's search engine - the world 's most influential gateway to online information and commerce - enjoys a near - monopoly in @entity18			2
the major concession offered by @entity1 is widely expected to center on more clearly labeling search results stemming from its own services such as @entity12 , @entity57 or its shopping search function			1
in addition , @entity1 is supposed to offer remedies on the three other main areas the @entity27 has criticized			0
those centered on how @entity1 displays content from other websites , how it manages the ads appearing next to its search results , and how its actions affect marketers ' ability to buy ads on rival networks			2
both , @entity1 and the @entity27 , have declined to spell out what remedies the @entity74 , @entity75 , company is proposing pending the official announcement of the market test			0
without reaching a settlement - to which both sides are committed - the @entity27 would likely formally file a case against @entity1 , setting the stage for a lengthy process that could result in the company being fined up to 10 percent of its annual revenue			0
