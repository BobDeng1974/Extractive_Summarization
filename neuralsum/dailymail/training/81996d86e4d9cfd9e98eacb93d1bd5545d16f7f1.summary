@entity0 appears to have been well - liked across the pond , as many @entity3 politicians have reflected on their respect of the now - deceased @entity6 leader			2
among her admirers is former first lady @entity8 , the widow of president @entity9 - who worked closely with the so - called @entity10			2
@entity9 and @entity0 joined forces in the early 1980s and drastically changed the economic and political landscapes in both of their countries			2
and their side - by - side standing up to @entity30 communism is credited by those of all political stripes as hastening the end of the @entity34			0
dynamic duo : @entity9 and @entity0 's calls for more - austere government and lower taxes still resonate with conservatives on both sides of the @entity27 speaking to @entity39 's @entity38 yesterday , mrs @entity8 said that it was n't just her husband who got along well with @entity0 , but she did as well			1
' we had a very special relationship , ' mrs @entity8 said via phone			2
' i think people thought she and i did n't have a relationship			0
nothing could be farther from the truth			0
and of course i loved it that she and @entity52 were as close as they were			0
' also singing @entity0 's praises was president @entity55 , who said that @entity3 ' has lost a true friend			2
' the kind words came amid the revelation that @entity0 died in the luxury suite at the @entity60 where she had spent months recuperating after an operation			1
@entity6 's first and only female prime minister , who passed away peacefully at the age of 87 after suffering a massive stroke , had checked into the five star hotel at the start of the year following minor surgery on her bladder over @entity70			1
while a close - knit circle of friends took it in turns to visit the increasingly frail 87 - year - old at the @entity76 - a long - time favorite of the former leader 's - it was a solitary start to what would prove to be her final few months			2
she had been due to spend christmas day with her niece @entity82 , who lives in north east @entity83 , but was admitted to hospital five days earlier for minor surgery to remove a growth on her bladder			0
iron lady : @entity0 , who died today , was pictured on a bench in @entity90 , @entity83 with her carers and a police officer ritz : media and police were gathered outside the five star @entity96 in @entity83 today , where @entity0 died after suffering a massive stroke her daughter @entity99 , 59 , was understood to be at her side in the hospital at @entity70 time			1
after being discharged @entity0 was checked straight into a suite at the hotel in @entity76 amid concerns she would no longer be able to manage the stairs at her elegant four - story mansion			2
staff at the hotel had invited her to make the @entity60 her home for the foreseeable future , and her carers are understood to have been taking it in turns to stay with the 87 - year - old			1

close friends of the former prime minister said after she was discharged that she was in ' sparkling form ' following the procedure , but admitted the experience had been ' very draining ' for her			1
home life : the former prime minister had spent recent christmases without her children @entity99 ( pictured with her mother ) and @entity126 the spell in hospital followed more than a decade of fragile health for @entity0 after she suffered a series of minor strokes in 2002			1
she had been suffering from acute short - term memory loss , which could make social gatherings an unsettling experience , and in recent years the once formidable @entity10 had all but disappeared from public view			1
alongside her health issues , in 2003 @entity0 suffered the devastating loss of her husband @entity147 , 88 , who she had described as the ' golden thread running through my life			2
' the life - altering loss heralded the start of a new chapter in her life , one in which she appeared to spend increasing periods of time without her close family around her			0
loved ones : family was said to be essential in the life of @entity0 , who was mother to @entity99 , left , who rushed home from a ski trip in @entity118 , @entity120 , yesterday , and sir @entity126 , right ' golden thread ' : @entity0 's husband @entity147 died in 2003 at the age of 88 after suffering heart problems and pancreatic cancer although she was a mother of two , it was with mrs @entity170 - the daughter of @entity0 's late older sister @entity171 - that she had been due to spend last @entity70 before she fell ill. she dined with mrs @entity170 and her family on christmas day 2011 , while both @entity99 and @entity126 spent the festive season abroad			1

@entity147 , the director of a paint firm , helped the fledgeling politician by driving her around			0
they married in the autumn of 1951 when @entity0 was 26			0
as she went on to embark upon a career at the highest echelons of @entity6 politics , she relied on @entity147 as a constant source of discreet support			0
the pair had enjoyed an marriage lasting more than 50 years , but @entity0 's family life was not without moments of crisis			1
some months after the death of her husband she endured a second personal trauma when their son , sir @entity126 , was charged in august 2004 with plotting a coup to overthrow the government of oil - rich @entity203 - a charge which could , in its extreme , have led to the death penalty			0
@entity0 , already suffering ill health , was deeply upset by the news about her son , to whom she was devoted			1
to her intense relief , he entered a guilty plea and was punished with a large fine and a suspended prison sentence			0
@entity0 was well enough to celebrate her 87th birthday with sir @entity126 , 59 , and his wife at a @entity83 restaurant last october			1
she had also enjoyed robust health during her term as prime minister			1

but in the past decade , she had become increasing frail			0
in 2002 , she made her first concession to increasing age when she cut back her workload on the advice of doctors			0
concern about her health had been growing and it emerged she had suffered a minor stroke shortly before @entity250 2002 during her golden wedding anniversary holiday with sir @entity147 in @entity252			2
the series of minor strokes forced her to retire from public speaking			2
despite this , in may 2004 - the 25th anniversary of her election as prime minister - she defied doctors ' orders to speak at a dinner held in her honour , attacking the @entity264 and praising @entity265 , then @entity226 leader			1
