in @entity1 alone it is estimated that 2.5 million dogs are eaten every year - and millions more are eaten around in the world , mostly in @entity4			1
residents of many countries , however , view dog - eating as immoral , while the practice is forbidden by @entity9 and @entity10			2
but one expert has claimed that eating dogs should n’t necessarily be discouraged , and in fact adding the domesticated pets to our menus could be beneficial			1
warning : some readers may find the images below distressing eating dogs is commonplace in @entity4 countries like @entity21 and @entity22			1
but the @entity24 's @entity23 says we should also consider it in the @entity26			1
he says eating shelter dogs is a good alternative to euthanisation			1
in this photo released by the @entity31 , a dog waits to be sold for meat in a market in @entity34 , @entity35 in an opinion piece for @entity24 @entity23 says eating dogs is the equivalent of eating pigs , another intelligent creature			1
for centuries , dogs have been man 's best friend			2
but it turns out canines would drop humanity for artificial intelligence in a second if offered a treat			0
a study in @entity52 found that dogs interacted with robots similar to how they would with humans if those robots seemed ' social '			0
the researchers conducted their experiment by having a robot point out hidden food to a dog and measuring their reactions to the robots directions			0
but the dogs were better able to find the hidden food when the robot had a human face on it 's monitor , and acted ' socially '			1
he cites figures from the @entity70 ( @entity70 ) that say 1.2 million dogs are euthanised every year in the @entity72 and he suggests eating them is not only an option , but it could also be helpful			2
according to @entity23 , in a book titled ‘ @entity78 ’ vegetarian novelist @entity76 writes : ‘ unlike all farmed meat , which requires the creation and maintenance of animals , dogs are practically begging to be eaten			2
‘ the simple disposal of these euthanised dogs is an enormous ecological and economic problem			0
' the problem arises in the disposal of euthanised dogs - while some are cremated , others are left on landfills			0
according to the @entity94 of @entity95 veterinarians use potent drugs to euthanise pets			0
but if not properly disposed and left on a landfill , ' scavenging wild or domestic animals can be poisoned by the drug remaining in the dead animal			0
' and @entity102 continues : ‘ it would be demented to yank pets from homes			0
but eating those strays , those runaways , those not - quite - cute - enough - to - take and not - quite - well - behaved - enough - to - keep dogs would be killing a flock of birds with one stone and eating it , too			2
’ @entity23 , however , does not condone the poor treatment of dogs intended to be food			1
one photographer who recently travelled to @entity22 , @entity116 and @entity21 to investigate the trade tells @entity118 it is a ' very touchy subject '			1

‘ eating dog is a very touchy subject and one that can provokes incredibly angry responses , ’ he tells @entity118			1
‘ i personally would n't eat it and would n't support the idea of eating it but it is not my place to tell others what they can or ca n't do especially when they come from a totally different culture			0
‘ i think it is fine to outlaw it in countries like ours that has a very close relationship with dogs and strong animal rights			2
‘ but in a country whose culture it is and has been for a long time to eat it i do n't think it is our place to tell them to stop			0
‘ @entity176 's do n't get angry when the rest of the world eats cows so whilst people eating dogs is upsetting to us we must accept that the practise happens and try and see it from their perspective			1
‘ seeing the dogs being beaten in such a way was horrible and upsetting but it ’s my job to suppress my emotions and simply concentrate on the telling of the issue			0

pictured is a caged dog rescued by animal lovers in @entity35 on its way to a restaurant in 2012 @entity23 does not condone the actions of the trade - which can include cramming dogs into cages among other abhorrent practices			1
but he does question why we should frown so heavily on eating animals we regard as pets or friends , whereas others like cows and pigs are so readily eaten			0
on @entity214 , opinion has been divided on @entity23 ’s piece			2

recently in @entity35 activists took to the streets to protest against the country 's @entity226			2
held in @entity34 , @entity228 province the event sees dogs killed and eaten in celebration of the summer solstice			0
animal rights activists say the event is a public health risk because the dogs undergo no quarantine to ensure they are free of disease , and that they are strays grabbed off streets around the country , as well as allegedly stolen from pet owners			0
the dogs are often poisoned with toxic chemicals that could be harmful to humans , they say .			0
