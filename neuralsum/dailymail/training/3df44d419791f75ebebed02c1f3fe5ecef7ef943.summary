by @entity0 published : 09:47 est , 17 july 2013 updated : 10:32 est , 17 july 2013 @entity1 is not one for keeping her opinions to herself and women appear to be the target of her latest outburst as the 25 - year - old @entity6 finalist has declared that she ' hates feminists			1
' it 's a curious admission considering her success on @entity12 's reality tv show , in which an equal number of aspiring young businessmen and women vie for the chance to work with the business magnate			1
the cake shop owner from @entity20 , @entity18 has defeated 14 other candidates to make it to tonight 's final on @entity24 , in which she 'll be competing against another aspiring businesswoman , 24 - year - old @entity27			1
lady in red : @entity1 on @entity30 ( left ) and on holiday in @entity32 last june this perhaps explains @entity1 's subsequent retraction of sorts , as reported by @entity36 : ' okay , i do n't hate feminism			2
i 'm totally behind women in business but i just do n't think gender should be an issue at all			2
' the self - described ' @entity43 ' adds , ' what i 've learned through this process is that the general public are quick to say i 'm a bimbo when they first meet me			0
but just because i 've got my boobs out does n't mean i have n't got a brain in my head			0
' ' i do n't think we should be judged for the way we look			2
they should recognise our business ability and say , " you 've done well girls "			0
' @entity1 's stint on the show has been notable for a spate of controversies			2
the @entity62 reported that she had an affair with her married boss when she was a 17 - year - old school - leaver entering employment for the first time			0
challengers : @entity1 , cake shop owner , and @entity27 ( right ) , practising doctor - @entity30 finalists this was revealed shortly after footage was discovered featuring the businesswoman and mother confirming that she had an abortion when she was 16			1
and earlier this month it was alleged that @entity1 's ex-boyfriend ran a firm of high - class prostitutes and encouraged her to sign up			2
a source told @entity62 , ' most women would run a mile if they found out their man sold women for sex , but @entity1 was n't fazed in the slightest			0
' the source added : ' when her boyfriend saw how accepting she was of his business he asked her if she wanted to give it a go			0
he knew how popular she would be with his clients so he was very keen to get her involved			0
' the ' job interview from hell ' : @entity12 on @entity30 with this season 's candidates time out : @entity1 has been living it up on holiday in @entity99 when not working on the show the show assembles candidates into groups that race to complete the tasks assigned them			1
and this season has n't been easy : assignments have included activities like creating and branding their own ready meals , opening and selling a farm shop , and conceiving of a new online dating concept that would withstand the scrutiny of a group of experts			0
based on the strength of her business running two cupcake shops , @entity1 hopes to impress @entity12 with her plan to launch a range of baking supplies			1
@entity122 hopes her business option - opening a chain of non-surgical cosmetic clinics - will win @entity12 's Â£ 250,000 investment			1
the @entity127 business mogul and his colleagues have expressed ethical concerns about @entity122 's idea , wondering how honest it is to make money out of ' girls not feeling good about themselves , ' as an adviser put it			0
this suggests @entity1 may be pulling ahead of her adversary ; but it 's not long to wait before tonight 's winner is announced .			1

cake shop owner is one of two women to reach tonight 's @entity6 final
wants women to be judged on their brains rather than their looks
