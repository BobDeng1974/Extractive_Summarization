raiding the cupboards for food is a well - known effect of smoking cannabis			0
but for years , scientists have been unable to understand why cannabis ’ active ingredient , tetrahydrocannabinol ( @entity7 ) , causes such a powerful surge in appetite			1
now a @entity12 study has revealed that people get ‘ the munchies ’ after using marijuana because their sense of smell and taste is heightened			2
a @entity12 study has revealed that people get ' the munchies ' after using marijuana because their sense of smell and taste is heightened scientists claim the findings could be used to develop treatments that better tackle obesity and loss of appetite , according to a report in the @entity31			1
a group of neuroscientists , led by @entity34 of the @entity35 , found that in mice , @entity7 fits into receptors in the brain 's olfactory bulb			1
this dramatically increases the creature ’s ability to smell food and leading them to eat more of it , they said in a study published in @entity48			1
@entity7 , the active ingredient of cannabis , fits into receptors in the brain 's olfactory @entity53 olfactory bulbs are shown here in light green			1
it is a neural structure at the front of the brain involved in the perception of odours regularly smoking marijuana over a number of years can affect your short - term memory , according to another study by @entity34			2
long - term smokers may notice that they can not temporarily hold information in their heads , like a telephone number or the name of someone they have just met			0
a teams of scientists claim that this common side effect occurs because the drug hinders a signalling mechanism between neurons and non-neuronal cells called astrocytes			0
the study examined the role of the astrocytes , which have long been considered nothing more than support cells that protect neurons			0
the researchers found that tetrahydrocannabinol ( @entity7 ) , the psychoactive ingredient of marijuana , weakens the connections between neurons in the hippocampus , a structure that is crucial for memory formation			1
the team came to this conclusion after injecting mice with @entity7 and giving them a series of memory tests , such as forcing them to remember the location of an underwater platform in order to emerge from a miniature swimming pool			2
scientists exposed a group of mice to banana and almond oils as a test of sensitivity to scent			0
these mice sniffed the oils at first , and then stopped showing interest			0
but mice that were given @entity7 carried on sniffing			0
the @entity7 - dosed mice also ate much more			0
researchers then genetically engineered some mice to lack a type of cannabinoid receptor in their olfactory bulbs and subjected them to the same experiment			0
for years , scientists have been unable to understand why cannabis ¿ active ingredient tetrahydrocannabinol ( @entity7 ) , causes such a powerful surge in appetite even if these mice were given @entity7 , it had no effect , revealing the drug 's scent - enhancing powers involved activity in this region of the brain			1
the group explained that by making the sense of smell and taste more acute , @entity7 creates the same sensations felt when people deprived of food			2
if the findings hold true for humans , it may help develop treatments for appetite disorders by changing the link between smell and appetite .			1

@entity7 ( @entity7 ) is the the active ingredient in marijuana
study found that in mice , @entity7 fits into receptors in brain 's olfactory bulb
this increases creature ’s ability to smell food and leading them to eat more
findings could be used to develop treatments that better tackle obesity and loss of appetite
