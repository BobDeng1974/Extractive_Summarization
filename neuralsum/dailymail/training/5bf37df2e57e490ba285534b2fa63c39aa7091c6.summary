by @entity0 published : 11:31 est , 12 june 2012 updated : 11:42 est , 12 june 2012 accused : pensioner @entity1 and his pet dog @entity3 a pensioner who was accused of letting his dog foul on a public beach has been cleared by a court of any wrongdoing in just 10 minutes			1
the £ 1,000 cost of the failed dog fouling prosecution - which included a trip to the seaside - has been branded ' ridiculous '			1
@entity14 owner and respectable pensioner @entity1 , 71 , had been accused of allowing his dog to defecate on the beach in @entity18 , @entity19			1
so in a bizarre move , magistrates visited the soggy beach on a wet friday nine months after the alleged dog fouling			2
the visit was requested by @entity25 , who were attempting to prosecute mr @entity1 for the alleged mess			1
the three magistrates were joined by mr @entity1 , the prosecutor , defence lawyer , court clerk and community protection officer - and the dog in question , @entity3			1
@entity35 heard how @entity3 was allegedly seen ' doing his business ' on @entity18 beach last september			2
community protection officer @entity38 told the court he was ' 100 per cent sure ' he had seen the dog fouling the beach			1
giving evidence , he told the magistrates : ' i witnessed the faeces leaving the dog			2
' denial : the pensioner , who was in an emotional and distressed state throughout the court hearing , insisted @entity3 had squatted as if to do his business and he had gone over with a bag but mr @entity1 was equally adamant that his beloved pet had not fouled			1
the pensioner , who was in an emotional and distressed state throughout the court hearing , insisted @entity3 had squatted as if to do his business and he had gone over with a bag			1
he told the court : ' i had my bag in my hand ready to pick it up			2
there was nothing there at all , i am sure			2
' in fact the former @entity66 and @entity67 worker said he took a dim view of dog fouling , adding : ' i do n’t like it at all			0
' he said he always cleaned up after his dog and even after other people ’s dogs			0
the court heard that mr @entity1 was given the opportunity to pay a fixed penalty notice but declined			1
he told the magistrates it was ' a matter of principle '			0
he said : ' if i thought @entity3 had done it i would have paid the fine a long time ago			0
' mr @entity1 , of @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity19 , has no previous convictions			1
his solicitor @entity88 said the pensioner had never been in a courtroom before - apart from jury service and receiving a bravery award for rescuing a man from a river			1
the only time mr @entity1 had been in a police station was to hand in some lost money and @entity98 tickets , said mr @entity88			1
taking just 10 minutes to find him not guilty , chair of the bench @entity101 said they believed the officer had ' made an honest mistake '			0
after the case mr @entity1 said : ' i feel relieved it is all over and done with			1
' it was very tempting to pay the fine but it is the principle			0
i knew the dog had n’t done anything			0
' @entity112 , 68 , said : ' it has been really stressful for both of us			0
' i have n’t been sleeping properly for the last few months , neither has my husband			0
' i think it is ridiculous , it is not right			2
it was a waste of public money			0
it should n’t have gone as far as it did			0
' mr @entity88 said : ' i would expect it would cost in excess of £ 1,000			1
it has taken a full day ’s worth of magistrates ’ time			0
' a @entity25 spokesman declined to comment on the cost of the case			2
he said : ' we do take the issue of dog fouling extremely seriously as it has regularly been highlighted by residents as one of their main concerns			0
however , on this occasion , a mistake has clearly been made and we would like to apologise for any distress that was caused			0
