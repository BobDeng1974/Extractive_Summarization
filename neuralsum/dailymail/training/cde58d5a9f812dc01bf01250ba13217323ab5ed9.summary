by @entity0 published : 23:56 est , 8 august 2012 updated : 01:16 est , 9 august 2012 comedian @entity1 got in some trouble with @entity3 after he instructed his loyal fans to make unnecessary edits to the pages of @entity8 's possible vice presidential candidates in an effort to sway their viability			1
in response , @entity3 took the unusual step of locking the pages of the majority of @entity8 's short list , meaning that only experienced @entity3 users had the ability to alter the information			1
the internet kerfuffle came after political bloggers noted the trend that the number of recent edits made to the pages of potential nominees could be used to gauge how likely it is that said candidate will be @entity8 's choice			1
rebel rouser : @entity1 urged his viewers to make as many edits as they could to sway the vote watching his every move : political analysts are dying to know who @entity8 - seen here headed to @entity36 on wednesday - will pick for his vice presidential running mate an article on the site @entity43 president examined the trend that started in the days leading up to the announcement of vice presidential candidates in the last presidential election : shortly before @entity48 and @entity49 were revealed as their respective parties ' vice presidential nominees , there was a major spike in the edits to their pages			1
political blogs picked up on the idea , read into the virtual tea leaves , which lead to @entity1 encouraging his viewers to take the race into their own hands			2
@entity60 reports that the comedian told his viewers to ' make as many edits as possible to your favorite vp contender ' and spent time during tuesday night 's show with a bit about him editing former @entity68 governor @entity67 's page			1
a short while later , @entity3 locked the pages of @entity67 , senator @entity71 , congressman @entity72 , senator @entity73 , governor @entity74 , governor @entity75 and general @entity76 , all of whom have been at the top of many speculative lists			2
@entity83 blogger @entity82 said that while he initially endorsed the validity of theory about the @entity3 edits guiding post , further inspection proved that a number of the edits were done by the same sources , not all of which were substantive			2
@entity1 's shout out was inevitably going to drive up that traffic even further			2
by blocking the pages to new users , @entity3 still left a way for people who they consider ' experienced ' to make their contributions to the open sourced encyclopedia			1
frontrunner : seen here with @entity8 on tuesday , @entity103 senator @entity102 ( right ) had the most edits on her @entity3 out of all of the potential vp candidates anyone who reaches the status of an ' autoconfirmed user ' - which means they have had an account on the site for at least four days and made more than 10 edits - they will have the ability to make changes on the protected pages again			1
even @entity3 admits that this system still allows for a large number of contributors , many of whom may have an ulterior motive			0
' although the precise requirements for autoconfirmed status vary according to circumstances , most @entity123 user accounts that are more than four days old and have made at least 10 edits are considered autoconfirmed , ' they say on their access levels page			0
trailing behind : @entity73 had 100 edits on tuesday ( left ) , @entity71 had 81 ( center ) and @entity72 had 57 ( right ) putting them all behind @entity102 but the system of analysis is also flawed the correlation between the number of edits and a possible announcement was first noticed in 2008 as members of their campaigns who added more information to their profiles in the hours before their names were going to be searched thoroughly by @entity143 hoping to learn more about the candidates			0
for instance , @entity48 's page had 68 edits the day before her nomination was announced , while other prospects - which , at the time , included @entity8 himself - had far fewer changes on that fateful day			0
additionally , there is the ever - important aspect of context that has to be applied to the situation			0
when @entity48 was added to the ticket , she was essentially unknown to all @entity143 outside of @entity158 where she was part - way through her first term			0
as a result , it comes as no surprise that @entity165 's campaign staff wanted to add a significant amount of information to her biography before putting her in front of the electorate			0
trendsetters : the system of looking through @entity3 edits for clues came with @entity48 's selection in 2008 ( above ) but she also was less well - known than all of @entity8 's current candidates the same can not be said for @entity73 , @entity71 or @entity102 , all of whom have been under the political microscope for the past few months in wake of their connections to @entity8			2
while the edit tally may not prove to be accurate guiding posts for the vice presidential slot , the @entity8 campaign continues to push for people to download their free app which will deliver the news first once it breaks			1
another tried - and - tested method would be to follow the money			0
@entity83 reported tuesday that @entity71 is expected to rake in over $ 500,000 for the @entity8 ticket from two @entity194 fundraisers this week , which would be a positive argument in favor of his candidacy			0
at the same time , @entity201 - based @entity200 @entity199 coordinator @entity198 tweeted an anonymous tip that the @entity8 ’s first joint appearance with his vice presidential partner will be in @entity205 , foreshadowing that the candidate is likely from the @entity201 , ( meaning @entity73 )			1
it is likely that such rumor - mongering will go on for a number of days yet as many expect that the formal announcement wo n’t come until after the @entity212 finish in order to make the best use of the inevitable media attention .			0

in the days leading up to public announcements , vice presidential candidate 's @entity3 pages are *frequently* updated by campaign staffers
@entity1 told viewers to ' make as many edits as possible '
