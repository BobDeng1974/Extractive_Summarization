by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 10:33 est , 19 june 2013 updated : 04:03 est , 20 june 2013 bankers who behave irresponsibly will face criminal charges , @entity2 promised today			1
the prime minister revealed the government would change the law to catch reckless behaviour in the @entity9 and claw back bonuses from banks which had been bailed out with taxpayers ' cash			1
the pledge came after a major report recommended bosses of failed banks should face jail or lose the right to claim bonuses for up to ten years for ' reckless misconduct '			2
prime minister @entity2 promised to take action against reckless bankers and claimed @entity24 had failed to properly regulate the banks before the 2007 crash the new criminal offence would make sure that top executives paid for their ' shocking and widespread malpractice ' , the @entity27 said			1
not a single @entity33 banker has been sent to prison since the financial crash began in 2007 , but the proposed legislation would make sure they would be ' on the hook ' in future , it added			1
as well as prison terms , errant bankers would face heavy fines and bans from the financial services industry , as well as curbs on bonuses and the threat of pensions being cancelled			1
in the @entity49 , mr @entity2 was pressed on whether he supported the recommendations on bonuses and criminal penalties			1
' yes , i do support both of those measures , " he said			0
' obviously we need to take time to read this excellent report			0
' but penalising , including criminal penalties against bankers who behave irresponsibly , i say yes			1
also , making sure that banks who are in receipt of taxpayers ' money that you can claw back ... bonuses , i say yes too			2
' rise : bonus pay rose dramatically in april this year , according to figures from the @entity70 however mr @entity2 came under pressure from @entity24 leader @entity72 over a surge in bankers ' bonuses			1
@entity76 soared to record levels in april this year as bankers deferred pay outs to take advantage of the cut in the top rate of tax			1
during an intense clash at @entity2 ’s questions , mr @entity72 revealed the figures from the @entity70 which showed that bonuses in the business and financial services this april were 64 per cent higher than a year ago			1
@entity90 chief executive @entity89 is to become a government minister			1
he will replace former @entity93 chairman @entity92 as trade minister when he stands down at the end of the year			2
@entity2 told @entity96 : ' i can announce today that @entity89 , for the past five years chief executive of @entity90 , one of @entity33 's most successful businesses , will take on this vital role			1
' i believe he will bring huge talent to a vital national effort			0
' the @entity24 leader said : ‘ the reality is that bonuses are up 64 per cent in april in the @entity9 because he has cut the top rate of tax from 50p to 45p			1
‘ so people took their bonuses in april and got a massive tax cut as a result			1
' he added : ‘ for all his tough talk the reality is he is dodging his responsibility on banking reform			0
‘ lending is falling , bonuses are rising and while ordinary families are suffering he is giving a tax cut to millionaires			1
’ average weekly bonuses payments in finance and business services were £ 143 in april , up 64.4 per cent on the same time in 2012 and the highest level in records dating back to 2000			1
mr @entity2 took aim at @entity24 ’s record in power , blaming them for a failure to regulate			0
the prime minister said : ‘ bankers bonuses were about a third of what they were when he was in the @entity140			1
they have been going down not up			0
’ on a day when failures in banking were again in the headlines , mr @entity2 also revealed former @entity93 boss @entity92 is to stand down as a trade minister later this year			1
he will be replaced by @entity90 chief executive @entity145			1
in its 527 - page report , the @entity27 found that ' deep lapses in standards have been commonplace '			2
@entity27 chairman @entity149 mp said : ' under our recommendations , senior bankers who seriously damage their banks or put taxpayers ' money at risk can expect to be fined , banned from the industry , or , in the worst cases , go to jail			2
that has not been the case up to now			0
' this deals with some of the senior people who many feel got off lightly last time and for whose mistakes we are still paying			0
' disgraced : sir @entity167 , chairman of the @entity168 at a charity clay pigeon shoot event near @entity170 , 2003 ' it is not just bankers that need to change			2
the actions of regulators and governments have contributed to the decline in standards , ' said @entity180 mp mr @entity149			0
the commission of mps and peers calls for a sweeping overhaul of top pay , with @entity9 regulators given new powers to cancel pension rights and payoffs for the bosses of bailed - out banks			1
it also wants watchdogs to be able to force banks to defer bonus payments for up to a decade , in order to prevent bosses reaping large rewards for risky , short - term strategies that subsequently lead to losses			2
' the rewards for fleeting , often illusory success have been huge , while the penalties for failure have been much smaller , or non-existent , ' mr @entity149 said			0
however , @entity205 , director general of the @entity206 , said : ' there are tough criminal sanctions in the @entity33 for those who engage in fraudulent behaviour			1
enforcing those must come before the introduction of new sanctions			0
' the findings of the commission , set up last summer in the wake of the libor scandal , are not binding , but the government is being urged to implement its recommendations ' in full '			0
the proposals will now be handed to ministers			0
the reforms will aim to prevent a repeat of the bailouts and scandals such as libor rate - rigging , where bosses have walked away with large payoffs and pensions			1
but bankers will not be targeted retrospectively			2
@entity167 , who left @entity231 in ruins but is still receiving a pension of £ 342,000 a year for life , will be unaffected			0
nor will any legislation ensnare former @entity237 boss @entity236 , who will collect £ 406,000 of his £ 580,000 - a - year retirement deal			1
under current rules , senior bankers have been able to evade punishment by claiming they were not personally responsible for collapses and that they had not committed deliberate fraud , with the onus on financial authorities to prove wrongdoing			2
but in the new proposed regime , top managers would be held individually accountable and would have to show they took ' all reasonable steps ' to avoid a failure			2
' a lack of personal responsibility has been commonplace throughout the industry , ' mr @entity149 added			0
' senior figures have continued to shelter behind an accountability firewall			0
' the commission also wants a new licensing system to stop traders involved in setting @entity261 rates and prevent area managers who oversee the sale of financial products from slipping through the net			2
they will have to abide by a new set of conduct rules or lose their licence			0
the report also recommends that @entity9 watchdogs should be able to force badly - behaved banks to sign a formal agreement to improve their culture and standards			2
the commission – whose members include the archbishop of canterbury @entity280 and former chancellor @entity282 – also demands the dismantling of @entity284 ( @entity284 ) , the body that is supposed to manage taxpayers ' holdings in @entity231 and @entity288 at arms ' length from ministers			0
it said the government , which denies forcing the resignation of @entity231 boss @entity295 , has interfered in the running of the two banks and that @entity284 is seen as a ' fig leaf ' for ' the reality of direct government control '			0
ministers must also make an immediate commitment to analyse whether @entity231 should be split up into a ' good bank ' , that could lend more to small firms and personal customers , and a ' bad bank ' to dump its toxic assets , the commission said			0
a study of high street lenders by competition watchdogs and an independent panel of experts to look at measures to help bank customers were also part of the recommendations			0
@entity318 , a former @entity140 spokesman , said : ' why are there no banged - up bankers ? that is what most people want to know after the last five years of scandals and shame and moral and financial bankruptcy			1
' he added : ' we must stop the subterfuge of @entity284 and put the @entity140 on the spot to make the banks we own lend			0
' @entity231 , our biggest business bank , has failed the nation that rescued it at £ 1,500 for every taxpayer			0
it must be broken up with new management and tough net lending targets for the good bank so small business can grow again			0
