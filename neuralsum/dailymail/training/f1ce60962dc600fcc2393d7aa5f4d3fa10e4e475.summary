the 23 - year - old icy blonde chose to go public with the news of her sexual reassignment surgery earlier this year , and now reveals it was against the advice of her agents			0
it 's still too soon , she says , to tell whether her career will suffer as a result			2
' i hope that by sharing my humanity , pain , tears , laughter , joy , and biggest struggles on film , it will shed light on what it means to live as a transgender individual , ' miss @entity0 says			1
the team need $ 200,000 to continue miss @entity0 and her filmmaker friend @entity43 have already been shooting footage for the documentary for two years , covering her last few photo shoots as a male model , her sexual reassignment surgery and her big reveal to the public			1
in order to film the next six months , the team is appealing for $ 200,000 in funding , and have so far raised $ 16,733 , with 32 days left on the clock			1
miss @entity0 - who rose to fame as an androgynous male model - is still unsure as to whether the fashion industry will accept her as a female , or whether much of her appeal will now be lost			1
this upcoming chapter , she says , will be crucial to the documentary			0
then and now : miss @entity0 was born a boy and grew up in a war - torn refugee camp in @entity66 ( left )			1

miss @entity0 later moved with her mother , with whom she is very close , to @entity67 ; where she was discovered by a talent scout - true to cliché - working in @entity84 's			1
after @entity86 put her , ( then , him ) on its cover in 2011 and crowned her ' @entity89 , ' miss @entity0 's niche had seemingly been set in stone			1
candid : ' i hope that by sharing my humanity , pain , tears , laughter , joy , and biggest struggles on film , it will shed light on what it means to live as a transgender individual , ' miss @entity0 says looking good : miss @entity0 is still unsure as to whether the fashion industry will accept her as a female , instead of an androgynous male			1
pictured last week ( left ) and in april ( right ) ' if she wanted to remain a success , she had to remain a boy , ' her @entity3 campaign reads			2
' her agents said it			0
most importantly , her family relied on it			0
' speaking to the @entity119 last week , miss @entity0 said : ' there are agents that would tell me : " do n’t ever do it			1
you ’ll lose everything ”			0
' but transition she did , and this weekend , miss @entity129 announced she had left her former agency , @entity131 , to join @entity132 - an all woman 's agency - as a solely female model			2
on saturday , she posted her new photo card to her @entity137 account with the caption : ' new agency ! new life ! ' ' when i was little , i dreamed of being a girl			0
in fact that was my biggest dream , ' miss @entity0 says in a scene from her trailer , seemingly shortly before her life - changing surgery			1
' it 's a goal i 've had my whole life			2
it 's all been kind of leading up to this			2
' in a following photo , she is sprawled out on a hospital bed , hooked up to an @entity154 , and in one scene , she is hunched up in a hotel room weeping , and muttering : ' i really miss my mom			2
' in another , miss @entity0 dives into her agonizing decision as to whether or not to tell people , her agent included , about her transition post surgery			2
male past : at the height of her popularity , miss @entity0 was championed for appearing to exist between genders			2
pictured in 2012 ( left ) and in 2013 ( right ) ' we live in a world that does n't like , trust , or respect transgender people , ' she says			0
' it felt like there were two options for me			0
' i could transition , forget about my past , hide it , live in fear			0
or i could be proud , share my story with the world and hope that it does some good			0
' ultimately , it was @entity43 who convinced @entity181 to not only tell her agent and her business associates , but to tell the whole world her story			0
' this is a powerful part of an immensely courageous journey , we need to film this ! ' she recalls him telling her			0
' you know how many trans people - and people in general - are out there hiding , forced to live as someone they are not ? you could give them hope by going public about this			0
' category defining : in 2011 , miss @entity0 walked the runway during the @entity203 women 's show as part of the @entity205 ( pictured ) miss @entity0 claims to have turned down offers from ' large global networks , ' eager to swoop in on her story , but has opted to go down the road of independent film making instead , so as to ' maintain creative control			1
' she insists that she and her team are contributing their own money to finish the documentary , but ca n't afford to cover the full costs			0
miss @entity0 is offering a variety of rewards for healthy donations , including signed merchandise , a @entity220 with herself ; or , for pledges of $ 10,000 or more , tickets to attend a show with her at @entity223			1
whether miss @entity0 will appear in any of the shows herself , at this week 's @entity225 or in @entity226 , @entity227 or @entity228 , is a question left hanging			1
if all goes ahead with the documentary however , these are the sorts of answers we can expect to have answered in intimate detail as the next chapter of her life unfolds .			0

she earned huge success as an androgynous model but following her sex change , she will only be modeling women 's fashion
