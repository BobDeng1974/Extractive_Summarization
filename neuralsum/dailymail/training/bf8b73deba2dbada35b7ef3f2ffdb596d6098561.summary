a seven - seat space taxi backed by @entity2 to ferry astronauts to the @entity4 will make a high - altitude test flight next summer , officials said this week			2
@entity7 's ‘ @entity9 ’ space plane , which resembles a miniature space shuttle , is one of four space taxis being developed by private industry with backing from the @entity15 government			1
for the unmanned test flight , it will be carried into the skies by @entity19 , the carrier aircraft for the commercial suborbital passenger ship @entity21 , backed by @entity23 , a @entity15 company owned by sir @entity25 's @entity24			1
space taxis : an artist 's impression of the @entity9 craft that may one day be used to take astronauts to the @entity4 the test flight was added after privately held @entity7 got a $ 25.6 - million ( £ 16million ) boost to its existing $ 80 million contract with @entity2			1
the test flight will take place from either @entity36 in @entity38 's @entity37 , or from the @entity39 in @entity40 , according to @entity41 , manager of @entity2 's @entity42			2
with the retirement of the space shuttles this summer , @entity2 is now dependent on @entity45 to fly astronauts to the space station , at a cost of more than $ 50million per person			0
blast off : the test flight will take place from either @entity36 in @entity38 's @entity37 , or from the @entity39 in @entity40 the agency hopes to turn over crew transportation services to one or more commercial firms before the end of 2016 , @entity41 said			1
in addition to @entity7 , @entity2 is funding spaceship development work at @entity58 , @entity59 , and @entity60 , a start - up firm owned by @entity62 founder @entity61			2
‘ having only one way to get crew to the station is a limitation , ’ @entity2 astronaut @entity63 , who is currently living aboard the outpost , said during an in - flight interview last week			0
@entity70 's not the limit : @entity9 will be launched using @entity19 , the carrier aircraft for @entity23 's @entity21 the station , a $ 100billion project of 16 nations , was finished this year after more than a decade of construction 225 miles ( 350 km ) above the planet			1
the outpost , which is about the size of a five - bedroom house , supports a variety of scientific research and technology demonstrations			0
along with helping to develop commercial space taxis , @entity2 is working on a heavy - lift rocket and capsule to fly astronauts and cargo to asteroids , the @entity90 , @entity91 and other destinations beyond the space station 's orbit			1
drawing heavily on equipment originally built for predecessor programs , including the space shuttle and the cancelled @entity99 exploration initiative , the new rocket , called the @entity101 or @entity101 , is scheduled to debut in 2017			0
that unmanned test flight would be followed in 2021 by a trial run with astronauts , said @entity105 director @entity104			0
@entity106 above : the @entity4 orbits at over 200 miles above @entity107			0

@entity7 's ' @entity9 ' resembles mini shuttle
it will use @entity23 's carrier aircraft for test
private taxis could take over station flights in 2016
