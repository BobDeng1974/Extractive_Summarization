two soldiers who were wounded in @entity1 are retracing @entity4 's @entity3 rescue mission after almost 100 years			1
they are part of a four - man team who are flying out to @entity9 today to begin what promises to be a gruelling five - week trek across one of the most inhospitable wildernesses in the world			1
the mission was inspired by @entity4 , who famously saved the crew of his ship endurance more than a year after it became trapped in pack ice and sank			1
big shoes to fill : from left , @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24 fly out today to re-enact @entity4 's @entity3 rescue mission - 98 years after the famous explorer following in his footsteps : the @entity28 ( left ) led by @entity4 ( right ) ended in a long rescue the men , who are fundraising for a £ 300million military rehabilitation centre , will retrace the famous mission @entity4 made from @entity33 to @entity34 in a 22ft boat and back again in a rescue ship			1
led by @entity21 , one of the world 's most experienced explorers , and former captain in the @entity42 @entity24 , the team will spend five weeks on the mission			1
enduring freezing temperatures , they will first retrace @entity4 's journey from @entity33 to @entity34 , before trekking across mountains to the former @entity49 whaling station where he found help - a journey of almost 1,000 miles in total			2
thankfully they will have many more modern conveniences than @entity4 and his men - including crampons and the latest in exploring technology - but the trip is not without its dangers			2
one of the explorers is 26 - year - old corporal @entity22 , who was awarded the @entity62 for ' a display of personal courage , selfless commitment and inspired leadership ' in @entity1			1
the soldier was driving an armoured @entity69 vehicle on his second tour of duty to the country when it hit a roadside bomb , leading to a fierce firefight			0
he stayed cool under pressure , dragging a colleague to safety and making sure the injured were evacuated			0
ready to go : the team make the final preparations at @entity81 's @entity80 with their equipment trapped : the @entity83 was stuck in pack ice for months before it sank , leaving its crew to fight for survival but the next month , he was fighting insurgents when he was blown up by a grenade , shattering his elbow and hitting his leg with shrapnel			1
joining the serving soldier is lance corporal @entity23 , whose ear was injured in a grenade attack in @entity1 in 2010			1
despite having long - term problems he has returned to the @entity42 and is still playing an active part in the @entity98 - managing to go skydiving and caving in his spare time			0
he told the @entity100 : ' i get vertigo when i ’m climbing now and i ca n’t run as fast as i used to			0
' i ’m sure those things will slow me down			0
my main worry is that i will become a burden			0
' just as the @entity107 was breaking out in august 1914 , the @entity83 's crew set out from @entity81 with the lofty ambition of becoming the first to cross the @entity3 continent			0
in january 1915 the ship became trapped in pack ice and began drifting , its crew unable to do anything except hope it would become unstuck			1
once the ship ( left ) went down , @entity4 travelled almost 1,000 miles to the @entity49 whaling station ( right ) hard graft : the men pulled their remaining 22ft boat - fortunately the new expedition will have better equipment they remained by the ship for most of the year until finally , in november 1915 , it sank beneath the ice			2
that left the exposed crew to march across the inhospitable @entity3 ice , setting up camps in freezing conditions in their bid to be rescued			0
by march 1916 , the crew had shot the last of their original team of 69 dogs and eaten the youngest ones			0
the next month , when the crew were camped on @entity33 , @entity4 announced he was doing what most would have thought impossible - vowing to sail a boat just 22ft long more than 800 miles to @entity34			0
once he arrived he and two others trekked over glacier - covered mountains to fetch help from the whaling station , which sparked the eventual rescue mission			1
the re-enactment is in aid of the @entity149 of @entity152 's @entity151 ( @entity150 ) at @entity153 , near @entity154 , which is due to open in 2018 and cost £ 300million			2
poignant : the images of the @entity83 stuck in @entity3 ice have become a symbol of perseverence it will replace the current national centre in @entity161 in @entity162 , which the @entity163 says is out of date			0
it is backed by @entity166 , who said : ' it is very inspiring that 100 years on wounded soldiers are following in the footsteps of sir @entity4 's daring rescue from @entity33 to @entity34			1
' in doing so they will be displaying the same perseverance in adversity that characterised @entity4 's 1914 endurance expedition and which we see today in those members of the armed forces who are fighting their way back from serious injury			2
' to donate to the expedition visit the team 's @entity182 .			0

four @entity186 explorers fly out today to begin the five - week mission
backed by @entity166 , they include corporal wounded in @entity1
they are fundraising for military rehabilitation centre near @entity154
trip takes them on the same path as explorer 's 1916 rescue mission
his ship endurance was trapped in pack ice but the crew survived
