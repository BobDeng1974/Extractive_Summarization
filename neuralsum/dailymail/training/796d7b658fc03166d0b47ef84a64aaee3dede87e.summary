how rude ! senator @entity4 called @entity6 - the plus - sized governor of @entity7 - ' the king of bacon ' ' so if senator @entity4 wants to start looking at where he 's going to cut spending to afford defense , maybe he should start cutting the pork barrel spending that he brings home to @entity5 , ' @entity6 told reporters @entity6 last week criticized @entity4 ’s opposition to warrantless federal surveillance programs , saying it harmed efforts to prevent terrorism			1
@entity4 told reporters after speaking at a fundraiser outside @entity40 on sunday that @entity6 ’s position hurts @entity19 chances in national elections , and that spending priorities of critics like the governor and rep. @entity47 do more to harm national security			1
' they ’re precisely the same people who are unwilling to cut the spending , and their " gim me , gim me , gim me — give me all my @entity51 money now			0
’ ” @entity4 said , referring to federal funding after the hurricane last year			1
' those are the people who are bankrupting the government and not letting enough money be left over for national defense			0

' ' this was absolutely life or death money that was essential to @entity67 and @entity7 , ' @entity47 said			0
@entity6 , at a forum in @entity69 on thursday , pointed to a ' strain of libertarianism ' coursing through both parties as a ' very dangerous thought ' more than a decade after the sept. 11 attacks			2
@entity6 was asked whether he was referring to @entity4 , a fellow potential @entity19 presidential candidate who has been at the forefront of the party ’s libertarian wing			1
' you can name any number of people and he ’s one of them , ' said @entity6			2
' these esoteric , intellectual debates — i want them to come to @entity7 and sit across from the widows and the orphans and have that conversation			0
and they wo n’t , because that ’s a much tougher conversation to have			0
' war of words : @entity6 and @entity4 have been feuding for weeks about @entity4 's libertarian leanings @entity4 on sunday rejected arguments that the @entity96 ’s collection of hundreds of millions of @entity100 phone and @entity99 records is necessary to prevent terrorism			1
' i do n’t mind spying on terrorists , ' he said			0
' i just do n’t like spying on all @entity100			0
' @entity4 said the issue resonates particularly with young people , a key demographic republicans need to attract in order to succeed in national elections			2
' if you talk about some privacy issues like that , i think you will find youth coming to you , ' said @entity4 , who said his own decision on whether to run for president wo n’t come until next year			0
@entity47 called that argument misguided			0
2016 : both @entity6 and @entity4 are considered to be potential presidential candidates for the 2016 election ' when it comes to national defense , we should n’t be pandering to any demographic , ' he said			1
