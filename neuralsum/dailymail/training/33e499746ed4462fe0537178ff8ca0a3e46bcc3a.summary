@entity1 's fringe players put in a pitiful display against @entity3 - with a humiliating 4 - 0 defeat highlighting why they can not break into @entity6 's first - team plans			1
captain for the night @entity8 could not have put in a worse display as he gave away the ball for @entity3 ' first goal and disappeared from sight in the second half			1
@entity14 and @entity15 were particularly awful and @entity16 also struggled			1
here , @entity17 dissects the performances of some of @entity1 's fringe players			1
with the arrival of @entity42 and with more signings expected , @entity8 ' place in the team can no longer be guaranteed after this display			0
the first goal was definitely his fault as - under no real pressure whatsoever - he casually passed the ball directly to @entity49 , who played in @entity30 to open the scoring			2
@entity8 also went missing for the second goal - as did the whole defence - and continued to be caught out of position in the second half			2
as captain , @entity8 was expected to lead the young side to victory but instead his indecisiveness and wastefulness in position caused his team - mates to become nervous			1
not the way to introduce yourself to a new manager			0
not by any stretch of the imagination			0
struggle : @entity8 was unable to lead @entity1 well as captain and his mistakes led directly to goals out - muscled : @entity8 struggled all evening and he could not cope with the @entity3 forwards running at him @entity15 played a wonderful early ball through the middle to @entity14 on 10 minutes that the @entity74 wasted , but that was unfortunately about as good as it got for the midfielder			1
he put in an awful sliding tackle on double - scorer @entity30 on the half - hour mark for which he should have been booked , and that was about as close as he got to winning the ball most of the night			0
@entity15 ambled around the pitch for long periods without looking like controlling the game			0
he was thoroughly out - played by a @entity38 midfield , which basically says it all			0
he totally lost the run of @entity30 for @entity3 ' second goal and allowed him to chest in unmarked			2
@entity1 must off load him asap			0
please help me : @entity15 put in an awful display for @entity1 and looks certain to be shown the exit door struggle : @entity15 was bullied by a @entity38 midfield in @entity3 and he was terrible most of the night @entity14 this really was not the @entity74 's night			1
any potential suitors in the transfer market will not have been impressed with this display and may be getting cold feet over any deal			0
@entity14 slipped over in first minute after a wonderful ball through from @entity16 and from then on looked rushed and low in confidence in front of goal			2
on at least two occasions @entity14 should have scored for @entity1 but both times he blew his chances			2
first of all he turned his back on the ball in the 76th minute when he had a wide - open goal to aim at in an utterly baffling move			0
then he had a chance from six yards with three minutes left on the clock that was blocked but the @entity14 of two years ago would have buried it			0
waste : @entity14 did not take any of the chances that fell his way and was extremely poor struggle : @entity14 looked short of match sharpness and should have scored at least twice on the night @entity121 perhaps the only one of the fringe players who can leave @entity124 feeling like he may still have a future under @entity35			1
he lasted just 20 minutes after he failed to recover from a heavy collision in the ninth minute			0
@entity121 was left with a bloodied nose , blurry vision and mild concussion and left the pitch not knowing where he was - perhaps for the best ! @entity35 has described @entity121 as someone who ' can not hold ' in midfield , so the arrival of @entity135 will limit the attacking opportunities available to the playmaker even further			1
cut short : @entity121 was forced off the field with mild concussion and blurriness in the 20th minute unable to shine : @entity121 was not able to make his case to be regular starter after having his evening cut short @entity16 strangely @entity16 was one of the few @entity1 players to start well but , as the visitors faded , the forward disappeared completely in the second half			1
a wonderful counter-attack and ball in the box to @entity14 highlighted a brilliant start for @entity16 who looked pacey and full of intent , but he soon found himself starved of service			2
he had one powerful effort from 20 yards that just crept wide but apart from that he rarely looked like scoring			0
if he is to leave @entity1 you would think there will be plenty of suitors , but the game against @entity3 highlighted the frustration of @entity16 the player			1
he can look so good yet he just does not deliver so often when it matters			0
@entity164 : @entity16 started the game well but @entity1 faded in the first half and stopped providing him the ball frustrating : @entity16 looked good to begin with but , as @entity1 faded , @entity16 completely disappeared			1

braces from @entity30 and @entity170 help @entity3 to *famous* victory
@entity1 humbled in @entity25 second round
@entity6 yet to win a *competitive* game since taking over as boss
@entity35 played a team mixed with fringe players and **youngsters**
@entity8 captained the side but his mistake led to the first goal
he struggled throughout and did not lead the **youngsters** around him well
@entity14 misses a couple of brilliant opportunities to score
@entity15 went missing in midfield as @entity1 *succumbed* to defeat
@entity16 shows energy in first half but tailed off as game went on
@entity121 went off with mild concussion after just 20 minutes gone
