but when parents realised he was n’t bilingual they lodged complaints with the local council			2
‘ i think it is a disgrace that you have an @entity41 - only @entity4 coming to @entity29 , ’ one mother said			2
‘ it ’s going to cost £ 2.50 a child to meet him , so i ’d expect they could find one who can speak @entity6			2
‘ i have young children who are still not that confident when speaking @entity41 , i think it is a shame they wo n’t be able to chat to @entity4 in their own language			1
‘ the @entity50 should be supporting the @entity6			2
’ @entity51 , principal archives , museums and cultural officer , defended the decision to hire mr @entity3 , but said he had decided to step aside after learning of opposition to his appointment			1
‘ there are lots of @entity61 around but this one is one of a few who has a real beard and i felt we were very lucky to be able to bring him here , ’ she added			0
‘ i was going to be one of his helpers			0
‘ it is very disappointing , i never thought the @entity6 would be a question on this			2
’ when contacted by the @entity72 yesterday , mr @entity3 , who has been playing @entity4 for 12 years , insisted there were no hard feelings			1
‘ i was asked if i could speak @entity6 and i had to admit that i ’m not able to hold a conversation , ’ he added			1
‘ i was born in @entity76 and my father was @entity6			0
i ’ve lived here since 1949 and have tried to learn @entity6			0
i can get by , but not in a long conversation			0
‘ i ’ve no real need for it as no - one in my home speaks it			0
’ mr @entity3 , who has 27 engagements at schools and civic events , across north wales this year , added : ‘ i have no hard feelings about it			0
‘ if they want a bilingual @entity4 that ’s quite all right with me , i am happy to stand aside			0
i do n’t do this for the politics or the nationalism , but for the children			0
no hard feelings : mr @entity3 said he can not hold a conversation in @entity6 and so was happy to stand aside			1
he said : ' i do n’t do this for the politics or the nationalism , but for the children ' ‘ i enjoy being @entity4 and on christmas morning i ’ll be doing my rounds at the @entity102 here			1
‘ no one has mentioned the @entity6 before , but it is no problem so far as i ’m concerned			0
my outfit has cost nearly £ 400 pounds but the children love it			0
’ a spokesman for @entity106 said : ‘ we can confirm that @entity109 / @entity108 will be bilingual and he looks forward to celebrating the magic of @entity4 with children visiting @entity29 next month			1
’ the row comes just weeks after parents launched a protest group opposing the use of @entity6 in primary schools in @entity117			2
at one school , it was claimed , children as young as four were being refused permission to go to the toilet unless they asked in @entity6 and at another parents were dissuaded from reading bedtime stories to youngsters in @entity41 in case it hindering the development of their native tongue .			1
