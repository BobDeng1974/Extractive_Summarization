by @entity0 published : 10:59 est , 30 january 2014 updated : 11:01 est , 30 january 2014 mowing the lawn can be tedious , but that could change if an eco-friendly prototype robot is widely adopted			2
@entity6 students have created an autonomous machine that not only cuts grass in a specified area , but uses the waste cuttings to power itself – saving you both time and money			1
the e-mow is built upon the body of an electric toy car , but the clever vehicle is able to convert grass pellets into fuel , using a small biomass gasifier - a type of furnace that converts organic matter into gas			1
is this the future of gardening ? @entity6 students have created a prototype autonomous machine ( pictured ) that not only cuts grass in a specified area , but uses the waste cuttings to power itself - potentially saving gardeners both time and money engineers from @entity38 , @entity36 believe their invention could revolutionise the garden chore and more importantly be used as an efficient way to create animal feed			1
the machine trims grass using a low - power electrical bar cutter , unlike many mowers that use a rotating blade			2
this allows the mower to operate without the need to maintain the kinetic energy required in a rotary blade system			0
it then collects the grass snippets , which are funnelled into an area where they are turned into dry grass pellets in a manner similar to a meat grinder except that higher pressures and temperatures are used , the engineers explained			1
the machine trims grass using a low - power electrical bar cutter and collects the grass snippets , which are funnelled into a hot and pressurised area where they are turned into dry grass pellets the machine trims grass using a low - power electrical bar cutter ( pictured ) unlike many mowers that use a rotating blade the dry squashed cuttings then pass into a collection bin where they are dried with hot air from the gasifier and are then converted into fuel gas in the gasifier itself			1
this biomass fuel is then cooled , filtered and mixed with air so that it can be used to power the robotic lawnmower ’s engine			1
the grass pellets pass into a small gasifier ( illustrated ) where they are converted to gas and the resulting fuel is cooled , filtered and mixed with air the dried pellets can also be used for other applications , such as livestock fodder and can be periodically off - loaded to a storage unit			1
' the drone harvester processes biomass directly to product form in a single pass without human labour , ' said @entity99 , chief design engineer of the project			0
he explained that conventional methods for deriving biomass pellets from grassy sources areinefficient			2
multiple passes are required to harvest and raw biomass must then be trucked to a facility to process into products , but the new invention does all this in one step , he explained			0
users of the lawnmower will not have to push it around their garden , as the useful robot is autonomous thanks to onboard gps and proximity sensors			2
in the future they will be able to program the machine by selecting an area to mow using @entity122 – and tell the mower to avoid certain obstacles so flowerbeds are not cut down too			1
the machine will also use its gps system to watch out for roads and other boundaries , as well as to navigate itself efficiently around a garden			0
mr @entity99 and his team are currently looking to raise investment to bring their lawnmower to market and there is no price for the machine yet			2
' we will be designing and operating or own harvesting platforms to produce a range of pellet biomass products			0
primary target markets are pellet fuel and livestock fodder			0
' future plans include both commercial and consumer turf - mowing units for sale and licensing pellet fuel system technology for uses in vehicles , heating , and plant power , ' he said			0
mr @entity99 also said that @entity157 harvesters ' represent a revolutionary micro-grid solution in developing countries			0
' ' we plan to use this technology to provide a breakthrough in producing pelletised biomass products , ' he added			0
the team plans on having a working fuel reactor integrated with an engine in order to demonstrate a complete fuel system by march			0

@entity6 students have created an autonomous machine that cuts grass autonomously using @entity122 as a guide
built upon the body of an electric toy car , but the clever vehicle is able to convert grass pellets into fuel , using a small biomass gasifier
the vehicle is a prototype and its designers are eager to raise money to put the lawnmower into production
