by @entity0 for @entity1 president - elect @entity2 will succeed @entity3 , who has been in power since the @entity5 was ousted in 2001 former finance minister @entity2 has been named @entity7 's president - elect after he signed a deal to share power with his opponent - ending months of turmoil which has destabilized the nation			1
the announcement withheld the final election numbers , apparently as part of the political deal between @entity2 and rival @entity17 , a former foreign minister who claimed the process was rigged against him			1
' @entity20 of @entity7 declares dr. @entity2 as the president of @entity7 , ' commission chief @entity19 said			1
he added the full results would be provided at a later date , but did not specify when			1
he acknowledged deep flaws in the june 14 run - off vote and said a @entity27 - supervised audit was not adequate to weed out all the vote - rigging			0
' although the audit was comprehensive ( it ) could not detect or throw out fraud completely			2
' under the terms of the unity government deal signed on sunday , @entity2 will share power with a chief executive proposed by @entity17			1
the two will share control over who leads key institutions such as the @entity7 army and other executive decisions			1
the new administration faces huge challenges in fighting an emboldened @entity5 - led insurgency and paying its bills amid plummeting tax revenue			0
the crisis has further destabilized @entity7 just as the @entity49 - led military coalition prepares to withdraw most foreign troops at the end in the year , leaving @entity7 forces to fight the @entity5 insurgency			1
teams from both sides had met late into saturday night with @entity27 representatives to try to finalize a power - sharing deal before today 's scheduled announcement of the final election results after a @entity27 - monitored audit and recount			1
although the results of the audit have not been released , both @entity2 and @entity17 had claimed to have won the fraud - tainted election , and the @entity27 has pushed hard for a ' national unity government ' to avoid a return to the ethnic divisions of the 1990s civil war			1
the last sticking point was how to announce the results of the audit			2
aides and officials have said candidate @entity17 , a former foreign minister , had insisted that the official percentages either not be made public at all or be altered to give him more votes			0
@entity17 , left , and @entity2 , right , signing the power sharing agreement at the presidential palace in @entity77 today the two shake hands after the prolonged standoff following the election , during which both sides accused the other of fraud ' both camps have agreed 100 percent on everything and we 'll sign the deal tomorrow			1
everything has been initialed and there is no disagreement on anything , ' said @entity94 , a spokesman for @entity2			0
@entity95 , spokesman for @entity17 , also confirmed a deal had finally been struck , but did not give any details			1
preliminary figures released in july put @entity2 , a longtime @entity99 official , ahead with 56 percent of the vote , prompting street protests from supporters of @entity17 , who alleged massive fraud and said he was the rightful winner			2
the final sticking point in negotiations was over an audit of official polling figures and whether they should be made public a ruling coalition between the opposing camps is likely to be uneasy after a bitter election that has revived some of the ethnic loyalties of the civil war that led to the @entity5 taking power in @entity77 in the 1990s			1
@entity17 , a former @entity117 resistance fighter , draws his support from @entity119 and other northern ethnic groups			0
@entity2 , an @entity121 economist , is backed by @entity123 tribes of the south and east			0
but @entity2 's spokesman said the power - sharing pact had been secured and that details would be released at a signing ceremony on sunday , without giving a time			1
after the june run - off election was engulfed in fraud allegations , the @entity49 brokered a deal in which the two candidates agreed to abide by the outcome of an audit of all eight million ballot papers and then form a national unity government			1
but @entity17 later abandoned the audit , saying it was failing to clean out fraud			0
he won april 's first round , only to see @entity2 come from well behind and win in june			0
the new administration will have to stabilise the economy as international aid falls , and deal with worsening unrest nationwide			0
efforts to open a peace process with the @entity5 failed under @entity3 and may be revived			0
a total of 2,312 civilians were killed in the first eight months of this year , an increase of 15 percent from 2013			0
about 41,000 @entity152 troops remain in @entity7 , down from a peak of 150,000 in 2010 , fighting alongside @entity7 soldiers and police against the fierce @entity5 insurgency			2
@entity152 's combat mission will end in december , with a follow - on force of about 12,000 troops likely to stay into 2015 on training and support duties			0
the dispute ruined hopes for a smooth democratic transition to replace @entity3 , who has held power since the @entity5 's hardline @entity167 government was ousted in 2001 with @entity49 military support , and threatened to rekindle the ethnic tensions that had plunged @entity7 into civil war in the 1990s			1
@entity17 derives much of his support from the ethnic @entity173 and @entity174 communities , while @entity2 is widely supported by the @entity123 , the largest ethnic group			0
final election results have been delayed for weeks to await an audit of all 8 million ballots cast in the june 14 run - off vote between @entity2 and @entity17 , the top finishers in the first round in april			0
the audit was part of a deal brokered in july by @entity49 secretary of state @entity184 to try to avert a descent into violence			0
@entity7 's presidential election candidate @entity2 , right , leaves after signing a power - sharing deal as outgoing president @entity3 , left , stands at the presidential palace in @entity77 the accord signed today is the finalisation of a broader power - sharing structure brokered by @entity49 secretary of state @entity184 , who swiftly welcomed its signing			1
' these two men have put the people of @entity7 first , and they 've ensured that the first peaceful democratic transition in the history of their country begins with national unity			2
' one of @entity2 's first acts would be to sign a long - delayed bilateral security agreement with the @entity49 , as he has previously declared support for the pact to allow a small force of foreign troops to remain in @entity7 after 2014			2
there is a risk that any instability could be exploited by neighbours , like @entity210 , whose past involvement in @entity7 affairs have played a part in the conflicts that have dogged @entity7 for decades			2
' a difficult and challenged unity structure is still preferable to conflict between these two groups , ' said a @entity49 official in @entity77			0
@entity17 ( left ) and @entity2 pictured at the ceremony which confirmed their power sharing agreement what was the first democratic transition of power in the country 's history ' having them both working together within the government and direct their energies toward positive reform is again preferable to some of the alternatives			1
' @entity17 's accusations that the run - off election was rigged in @entity2 's favour had raised fears of ethnic violence , which could have ignited a broader conflict			0
' a spark could have dealt a strong blow to the political process , if today 's deal had not happened , ' commented @entity242 , director of the @entity243			2
' but , we have crossed that moment			0
' @entity2 is expected to be sworn in as president in about a week , according to @entity3 's spokesman @entity247			0
the settlement will also come as a relief for @entity7 , who have watched the tortuous process play out since they first voted in april			2
@entity3 has ruled since soon after the @entity5 government was ousted by @entity49 - backed @entity7 forces in late 2001 , and the drawn - out election was meant to mark the first democratic transfer of power in @entity7 's troubled history			1
' @entity7 will now be able to move forward for the next five years , even though it is not an ideal government , ' @entity242 said .			2
