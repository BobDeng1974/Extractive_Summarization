by @entity0 published : 07:17 est , 28 june 2012 updated : 19:24 est , 29 june 2012 @entity1 finally gave ground over new measures to save the stricken euro following an extraordinary night of summit brinkmanship by @entity6 and @entity7			1
the @entity9 chancellor reluctantly signed off a deal which will allow the eurozone ’s £ 600billion bailout fund to invest directly in @entity7 and @entity6 ’s crippled banks			1
@entity15 sources last night insisted that no @entity15 taxpayers ’ money would be involved in the deal , as @entity19 had already extricated us from any involvement in the bailout funds			1
he forced mrs @entity1 to yield on her insistence on tough reforms in exchange for bailout money stock markets across @entity31 rallied on the news , despite warnings that the complex deal may prove to be yet another ‘ sticking - plaster ’ solution			1
mrs @entity1 faced an angry backlash in @entity9 where her previous reluctance to extend aid to the country ’s profligate southern neighbours had proved popular with voters			1
the opposition @entity43 accused her of making a ‘ 180 - degree turn ’			0
the ‘ breakthrough ’ came after 14 hours of fractious talks during which @entity6 ’s prime minister @entity24 and his @entity7 counterpart @entity47 threatened to block a £ 100billion growth fund unless mrs @entity1 gave way			1
in an extraordinary power play they were backed up by @entity56 ’s new @entity55 president , @entity54			0
the @entity6 media launched an extraordinary attack on @entity1 yesterday , as the country gloated about a ‘ double victory ’ over @entity9			1
one newspaper ran a front - page headline saying simply ‘ @entity63 ’ , while @entity64 screamed : ‘ bye bye lard a * * * ’			0
vulgar : @entity6 newspapers @entity66 ( left ) and @entity64 ( right ) today launched offensive , front page assaults on @entity1 following her demands , which were not met , for a stringent bailout deal the @entity6 football team upset the form book to boot @entity9 out of the @entity73 championships on thursday			1
within hours , at the @entity75 summit on the future of the euro , @entity6 ’s prime minister @entity24 forced @entity9 chancellor mrs @entity1 to back down over her refusal to allow @entity31 ’s bailout fund to help the continent ’s struggling banks			1
mr @entity24 emerged from 14 hours of fractious talks to declare his country had achieved a ‘ double satisfaction ’ over @entity9			2
but the newspapers were far more blunt			0
@entity66 ran the headline ‘ @entity88 ’ , with an image of star striker @entity90 kicking a football bearing the @entity9 leader ’s face			2
under fire : mrs @entity1 leaves the summit after caving - in to @entity6 and @entity7 by abandoning its demands to enforce tough reforms in exchange for rescue money the attacks continued on page two , with a report on the football match headed : ‘ two kicks in the fat a * * *			1
’ both publications support ex-premier @entity108 ; @entity64 is owned by the 75 - year - old tycoon ’s brother			0
@entity111 , the @entity112 ’s culture spokesman , said : ‘ these attacks by the @entity108 press on mrs @entity1 are vulgar , churlish and disgusting			2
‘ they ’re also extremely misogynist			0
’ mr @entity24 even threatened to keep the @entity117 ’s 27 leaders in @entity75 until sunday night unless a deal was struck			1
shortly after 4am , mrs @entity1 ’s resistance finally crumbled			2
in a symbol of the @entity117 ’s increasingly two - speed nature , the deal was thrashed out by the 17 eurozone leaders three hours after mr @entity19 and the heads of other non-euro countries had gone to bed			2
the new initiative is designed to ease the pressure on @entity7 and @entity6 , which have seen their borrowing costs rise to unsustainable levels in recent months because of problems with their banks and debts			1
back of the net : a few hours earlier , @entity6 striker @entity90 provided a similar thrill for his countrymen by firing two goals past the @entity9 to take @entity6 to the finals of @entity73 in return , mrs @entity1 demanded agreement that all of the eurozone ’s banks would come under the supervision of the @entity146 in @entity147			1
mr @entity19 yesterday claimed victory for forcing the @entity117 to back down over plans to hand @entity75 control over the regulation of ‘ all ’ @entity31 banks			0
the final deal covers only banks in the eurozone countries , leaving the supervision of @entity15 banks in @entity158			1
the new initiative was widely viewed as the first step on the road towards the creation of a powerful fiscal union			0
@entity56 president @entity163 is very important that we put into motion procedures for immediate action - something that was much hoped for			0
bank supervision for a recapitalisation of the banks will take a bit more time , but this will be a lasting move in the right direction			0
' we defined a vision for the euro - for economic and monetary union - saying what we will do together , and there will be greater solidarity at each step in integration			0
' @entity9 chancellor @entity182 have taken important decisions last night			1
i am very satisfied that we took good decisions on growth			0
' @entity188 president @entity187 ' we are heading for a future where we will need very general supervisory bodies to look more carefully , more strictly , and which are more responsible for the financial sector and banking sector , and that 's where we are heading			2
' i hope that in a very few weeks , the euro zone leaders will be able to find a concrete mechanism for how to control the not - very - well - behaving banks and to help them			2
' @entity199 president @entity198 said officials would now draw up a detailed plan for ‘ genuine economic and monetary union ’ within the @entity203			2
‘ the aim is to make the euro an irreversible project , ’ he said			0
in a key concession by @entity9 , the leaders agreed to waive the bailout fund ’s preferred creditor status on lending for @entity7 banks , removing a key deterrent to investors buying @entity7 government bonds , who feared having to take the first losses in any debt restructuring			1
‘ we have taken decisions that were unthinkable just some months ago , ’ @entity220 president @entity219 said			0
but the deal does not involve any new money and many questions remain about how it might work.one @entity15 source said : ‘ they ’ve kicked the can a bit further down the road this time , but there is still a lot to do			1
’ @entity232 , market strategist at @entity234 , said : ‘ while there may be some temporary sense of relief that the summit has not descended in to acrimonious discord , what has been thus far agreed is nothing more than sticking plaster			0
’ the deal also includes a pledge to re-examine the strict austerity measures imposed on @entity246 as part of its bailout deal			2
but the deal played badly in @entity9 where mrs @entity1 headed straight to @entity251 in a bid to sell it to mps			1
asked if she had yielded to pressure , she said : ‘ there is clearly pressure from financial markets			0
some countries are in a difficult situation			0
the high interest rates affect the debt but also the real economy			0
we had an interest in finding solutions			0
’ but the influential @entity9 magazine @entity266 said mrs @entity1 had ‘ caved in on the most important points ’			1
the magazine accused the chancellor of leading @entity9 into an unpopular ‘ debt union ’ , adding : ‘ the reactions at home were devastating ; even the vote on the fiscal pact in parliament wobbled			2
@entity1 ’s advisers seemed surprised by the force of the attacks			0
’ the @entity279 newspaper said mrs @entity1 ’s compromises ‘ represent some of the biggest changes in the management of the @entity31 debt crisis since @entity283 received its first rescue package ’			0
shattered : an evidently tired @entity19 leaves the @entity117 leaders summit in @entity75 at 1am this morning			0
the 17 - nation currency zone went on to agree to emergency action to lower the borrowing costs of @entity6 and @entity7 and to create a single supervisory body for euro area banks back at it : @entity19 returns to the summit this morning after a few hours sleep @entity7 prime minister @entity47 speaks to the press			1
the summit is a victory for @entity7 and @entity6 after the @entity117 leaders agreed to lower the countries ' borrowing costs @entity199 president @entity198 announced the ' breakthrough ' after @entity19 and the leaders of the other nine non-eurozone members had left the summit , leaving the single currency bloc to thrash out a deal			1

@entity203 leaders work through the night to thrash out a deal
@entity9 chancellor @entity1 forced into embarrassing *u-turn* after abandoning demands for tough reforms in exchange for bailout money
leaders agree to lower borrowing costs of @entity6 and @entity7
@entity6 newspapers can not hide their glee with @entity323 front pages
fears that @entity15 's financial *industry* might be left *isolated* after it was also agreed to create a single supervisory body for euro area banks
