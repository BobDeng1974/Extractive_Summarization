most middle - class parents can no longer afford to take their children abroad because of the soaring cost of going away in the school holidays , a survey has found			2
three - quarters of those paid up to £ 24,000 – close to the average income – said they had difficulty saving up , and half of families with a combined income of between £ 44,000 and £ 54,000 said they had to make sacrifices to spend on a holiday			1
even those earning £ 74,000 to £ 84,000 are feeling the pinch , with more than a third complaining about prices			1
holiday prices can soar by as much as 200 per cent during school breaks			2
more than two - fifths of parents said they had got around this by going away in term time , with one in seven admitting to lying to keep their children off school including making up stories about illnesses or deaths in the family , the survey by holiday firm @entity35 found			1
seven in ten of the 1,000 parents who took part in the survey agreed a policy on term - time absences should be in place - but complained it should n’t be as strict			1
it comes after a @entity51 rant about the cost of breaks at @entity54 by father @entity55 went viral and led to more than 100,000 signing an online petition calling for a cap on price increases in school holidays			1
what a rip - off ! @entity55 was angered by the cost of holidays outside term time at @entity54 it means the issue could now be debated in @entity64			1
studies have shown that travel firms , airlines , hotels and other businesses inflate prices when schools close			2
others parents were granted authorised absences of up to ten days by sympathetic headteachers but this has been banned except in ‘ exceptional circumstances ’ since september			2
breaches are dealt with by fines of up to £ 2,500 or three months in jail			0
the @entity80 took action to improve academic standards by preventing children from missing classes - but it is also increasing the affordability crisis			0
last month it emerged a couple had been fined a total of almost £ 1,000 by magistrates after taking their three children away			0
defying the law : @entity91 and @entity92 were fined £ 1,000 for taking their three children abroad during term time @entity91 and @entity92 remained defiant afterwards , saying the penalty , on top of the cost of the holiday , was still cheaper than going away during the school break			1
the @entity80 said children who attend school regularly are nearly four times more likely to achieve five or more good gcses than those who are regularly absent			0
a spokeswoman added : ‘ we are giving all schools the freedom to set their own term dates			0
academies and free schools already have this freedom			0
‘ this means that parents and teachers can benefit from cheaper holidays at the end of september			0
we want schools to consider changes to term dates that will work for their pupils and their families			0

poll by a holiday firm claimed even those earning £ 50,000 felt the pinch
term - time absences are all but banned , leading firms to raise prices
one father *'s* complaint about @entity54 could *trigger* @entity134 debate
