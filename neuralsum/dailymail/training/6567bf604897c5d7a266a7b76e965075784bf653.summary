by @entity0 , mail online deputy political editor @entity3 's chief climate adviser has claimed @entity4 does not need any more wind turbines to hit renewable energy targets			0
@entity7 said the public will be able to choose other ways to create green energy to avoid building ugly wind farms in the countryside			2
the @entity15 peer 's remark fly in the face of official @entity18 forecasts showing the numbers of wind turbines tripling by 2030 - adding almost 10,000 to the 4,000 onshore wind turbines already built			1
onshore wind turbines split the @entity23 , with @entity15 mps increasingly hostile while the @entity25 remain in favour			1
@entity27 has blocked cuts to wind subsidies , but @entity3 is planning to take a tougher line in the next manifesto but the claim comes after @entity3 said there would soon ' come a time ' when @entity4 had built enough wind farms to slash @entity18 turbine subsidies			1
last month mr @entity3 said : ' we ’ve got the largest offshore wind farm anywhere in the world built off the coast of the @entity4 and another one coming on stream , almost as big very , very shortly			0
' but he added : ' in terms of onshore wind , obviously there will come a time when we will have built enough to meet all our targets and so i ’ve always said with subsidies , we should n’t keep subsidies for longer than they are necessary and so that is something we will be looking at			2
' @entity3 , as leader of the opposition , promised to lead the ' greenest government ever ' but has since come under fire as prime minister for the @entity23 's support for onshore wind farms @entity7 , the peer better known as @entity7 , has gone even further , claiming that the are alreadt enough wind farms with planning permission and no more are needed			1
he said @entity4 needed a ' portfolio of different mechanisms '			0
the peer said : ' i 'm happy that we have already got enough onshore wind to 2020 to meet that part of the portfolio			0
' the peer 's remarks come amid claims that the @entity15 are planning to go into the next election pledging to ' rid ' the countryside of onshore wind farms			1
a source close to the prime minister said mr @entity3 wants to toughen planning laws and tear up subsidy rules to make current turbines financially unviable – allowing the government to ' eradicate ' turbines			0
the @entity82 could make a manifesto pledge to cap the total number of wind farms , toughen up planning rules to make them harder to build or even lower government subsidies for turbines , it is understood			1
former agriculture minister @entity7 - now known as @entity7 - famously posed with his four - year - old daughter @entity90 tucking into a burger to show beef was safe during the mad cow disease crisis it comes after the government agreed that subsidies for onshore turbines would be cut by five per cent a year after 2015 under a deal reached by the coalition partners			2
in 2012 , support for onshore wind was cut by 10 per cent after the @entity75 came under pressure from more than 100 backbench mps , who wrote to him demanding action against windfarms spoiling the landscape in rural areas			2
in november it emerged that mr @entity3 had ordered aides to ' get rid of all the green crap ' from energy bills to bring down costs			0
the prime minister wanted the green levies , which go towards paying for renewables and helping poor people cut energy use , to be cut .			0

@entity7 said the government did not need to sign off any new turbines
@entity75 has said he will slash wind subsidies once enough turbines are built
@entity15 could promise to ' eradicate ' onshore wind farms in next manifesto
