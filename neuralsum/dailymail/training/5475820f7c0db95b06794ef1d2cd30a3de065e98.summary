@entity0 has circulated a draft @entity2 resolution praising its own human rights record and proclaimed it has ' nothing to hide ' from the world			1
in a closed meeting , dozens of diplomats sat in silence after the @entity0 handed out copies in a rare effort to counter the international community 's condemnation of its oppression			0
@entity15 finally broke the silence , saying it strongly opposes resolutions that interfere in a country 's internal affairs , a pointed reference to a separate resolution sharply criticising @entity0 's human rights record			1
the @entity22 , @entity23 : in a closed @entity2 meeting , dozens of diplomats sat in silence after the @entity0 handed out copies of a draft resolution praising its own human rights record the @entity29 told the @entity0 that @entity31 's recent contacts with @entity29 officials have been welcome , but that does n't mean its joint resolution with @entity35 criticising the @entity0 will be withdrawn			1
no diplomat commented on the draft resolution in the meeting , which broke up after just 20 minutes			0
the @entity0 said comments are welcome until the end of the month			0
' do n't hesitate to contact me , ' one said			0
the draft was not circulated publicly			0
in a letter to diplomats circulated last week , @entity0 said its resolution for the @entity46 would mention the country 's free education and medical systems and the ' recent positive measures ' to improve relations with @entity52			0
@entity0 has taken the unusual approach of promoting its rights record in the months since a @entity2 commission of inquiry report was harshly critical of the impoverished , reclusive regime			2
the 372 - page report accused the @entity0 of running political prison camps with up to 120,000 people and sponsoring abductions of @entity52 , @entity35 and others			0
the @entity29 and @entity35 are now encouraging the @entity63 to follow that report 's recommendations and refer @entity0 's situation to the @entity67			1
their draft resolution for the @entity46 's human rights committee also presses for targeted sanctions			1
leaked video which purports to show a @entity0 internment camp : a recent @entity2 commission of inquiry report was harshly critical of human rights abuses in the impoverished , reclusive regime brutal : the 372 - page report accused the @entity0 of running political prison camps with up to 120,000 people and sponsoring abductions of @entity52 , @entity35 and others @entity79 briefly made their case for their draft yesterday , saying @entity31 has been reaching out to the international community and that it participates in @entity2 human rights work			1
they also said @entity0 , @entity85 and @entity86 are all examples of countries that are frequent targets of resolutions like the @entity29 - @entity35 one			2
the @entity29 told the meeting it had received no recent examples of @entity0 engaging with the @entity2 side on human rights			2
the @entity29 - @entity35 draft resolution is non-binding and also needs approval by the 193 - member @entity46			1
even if the more powerful @entity63 takes up the recommendation to refer @entity0 's situation to the @entity67 , the effort is expected to fail because @entity15 would likely use its veto power as a permanent council member .			0
