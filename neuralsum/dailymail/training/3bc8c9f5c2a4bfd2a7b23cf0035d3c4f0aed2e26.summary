' @entity15 knew from the age of five that she was different from the other boys in school			1

life - long struggle : the father - of - three has been conflicted about her gender from the age of five she would secretly dress in her mother ’s clothes , borrow her make - up and style her hair in the bathroom mirror			1

and under her builder ’s clobber of jeans and a jumper she would be wearing women ’s underwear on the site : ' it was not for any sexual reason - i just wanted to be me , feminine			2
