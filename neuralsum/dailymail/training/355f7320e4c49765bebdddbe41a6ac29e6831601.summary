people living near a picturesque 15 acre beach on the south coast of @entity3 will not be allowed to use it after judges at the @entity6 ruled in favour of its @entity9 owners			1
five judges sitting at the @entity6 unanimously agreed that @entity12 in @entity13 , @entity14 , would not be able to become a village green and therefore enjoyed by locals			1
they ruled the stretch of sand would remained fenced off under the instruction of its owners , a joint venture of @entity9 local authorities			2
the ruling signaled the failure of a campaign by people living in the nearby town to have the beach registered as a village green so they could have unrestricted access to it			1
the closure of the beach has led to campaigns , including by @entity42 , pictured having a cup of tea on the sand it is owned by @entity47 ( @entity47 ) and judges ruled that giving the beach village green status could hamper @entity47 's running of the port			1
since the beach was closed off in 2008 there have been numerous protests , with townsfolk scaling fences to use the stretch of land and holding a ' protest picnic ' on the stretch of sand			2
@entity61 , who lives nearby , labelled the decision at the @entity6 ' crazy '			0
she said : ' this town has played here for generations			0
we are a small community and this is the gem in our crown , our uniqueness			0
' @entity70 has its beach front and we have the beach and breakwater			0
' i am not against the @entity9 - my husband is @entity9			2
this is about access to a fantastic place where people have been for generations			0
it was closed in 2008 , leading to protests ( left ) after barriers were installed ( right ) because of safety concerns ' it is an insignificant piece of land but , to us , it is a family beach			1
' i know it is about jobs and money but we would have more jobs in this town if we had some degree of tourism			0
' we have a tiny town council but they have fought very hard			0
it is just a crazy decision			0
' the battle over the beach started in 2007 , when the council lodged an application with @entity103 in response to @entity47 closing the beach because of safety concerns about the harbour walls and steps crumbling			1
in 2010 the application was accepted and the @entity109 ruled that the beach could be granted village green status			1
but @entity47 appealed against that decision			2
@entity113 ( left ) and @entity114 ( right ) , mayor of @entity13 , said locals are disappointed by the ruling campaigner @entity42 climbs over railings to get to the beach , which has been closed off to locals mr @entity42 had a cup of tea on the beach in protest that the popular family beach remains closed to local people the case ended up in the @entity6 and @entity128 , @entity129 , @entity130 , @entity131 and @entity132 heard the evidence in november			1
yesterday , they ruled that village green status could get in the way of @entity47 's running of the port			1
to be registered as a village green land must have been used by a significant number of local residents " as of right " for at least 20 years			2
politicians have said they will contact @entity47 , which also owns and runs @entity13 port , to ask them to allow residents to use the stretch of sand			1
councillor @entity114 , mayor of @entity13 , said : ' we do n't have the right to the land but that does not stop them giving permission			0
the mayor reads a statement informing locals that the village green campaign has failed following the ruling locals have been left bitterly disappointed at the decision and the failure of their campaign for the beach ' it is in their own interests to have a good relationship with the people of @entity13			1
' they are there on the other side of the river looking for our support with what they are doing , and by and large they have got that			0
' mrs @entity114 and @entity177 mp @entity113 are seeking a meeting with the directors of @entity47 , many of whom are based in northern @entity9			2
mr @entity113 said : ' @entity13 people will not rest until their beach is open to them once again , and neither shall i. ' this is a bitter disappointment for people in @entity13 , after all the effort that has been put in by the town council and the residents			2
' but i want to assure people in @entity13 that we are not giving up			0
around 200 protesters held a beach picnic and 100 of them scaled the metal fence in 2013 protesters said residents had been ' cruelly barricaded ' from the once - popular tourist beach in @entity13 ' i have already asked for a meeting with @entity47 to see how we might go forward and to reactivate the idea of the town council coming to an agreement with @entity47			1
' @entity13 councillor @entity201 , who started a petition to get the village green application started in 2007 , called on @entity47 to recognise the ' strength of feeling ' and let people use the beach			1
a spokesman for @entity47 said it was glad ' common sense had prevailed ' and its planned regeneration of the port would benefit the local community			0
he said : ' npp appreciate that this decision will be a disappointment to campaigners , and will now take time to consider the implications of the decision			0
' it was agreed with @entity47 before the court hearing that neither party would apply for costs .			0
