by @entity1 correspondent in @entity2 published : 13:00 est , 13 march 2013 updated : 13:16 est , 13 march 2013 a long time ago , in a galaxy far , far away , billions of stars were born			1
this picture - one of the first to be taken by @entity6 – the world ’s newest and most powerful telescope – shows an ancient galaxy forming stars at a breathtaking rate			1
during such ‘ starbursts ’ , hundreds or thousands of stars are born a year			0
in contrast , our galaxy , the @entity15 only sees around just one new star a year			0
the first image from the @entity6 telescope : this montage combines data from @entity6 with images from the @entity27 / @entity26 @entity25 , for five distant galaxies			1
the @entity6 images , represented in red , show the distant , background galaxies , being distorted by the gravitational lens effect produced by the galaxies in the foreground , depicted in the @entity25 data in blue			1
the astronomers were using only a partial array of 16 of @entity6 ’s full complement of 66 giant antennas , as the observatory was still under construction at an altitude of 5000 metres on the remote @entity43 in the @entity44			1
when complete , @entity6 will be even more sensitive , and will be able to detect even fainter galaxies			2
for now , astronomers targeted the brighter ones			0
they took advantage of a helping hand from nature , too : using gravitational lensing , an effect predicted by @entity54 ’s general theory of relativity , where light from a distant galaxy is distorted by the gravitational influence of a nearer foreground galaxy , which acts like a lens and makes the distant source appear brighter			1
the red arcs in the image represent a distant galaxy rapidly creating stars around 12billion years ago – the light generated has only just reached us on earth			1
the central white dot depicts another calmer and closer galaxy			0
it was already known that starbursts – bright and brief periods of rapid star formation – were much more common in the early universe than today but scientists had struggled to date them			0
the latest images , taken by a stunning series of radio antennae on plateau 16,400ft above the @entity2 ’s @entity83 desert , reveal that such intense periods of stellar birth occurred earlier in the universe than thought			1
data from more than two dozen galaxies shows that on average , the starbursts took place 12 billion years ago , when the universe was just under two billion years old			1
this is a full billion years earlier than previous studies had indicated			0
two of the galaxies are the most distant of their kind ever seen – so far away that the light in the form of radio waves captured by @entity6 started their journey just a billion years after the @entity101			1
in one of these , water was detected - the most distant observation of water in the cosmos to date			0
some of the distant star - forming galaxies are as bright as 40 million million suns , the journal @entity108 reports			2
the picture was taken by capturing light emitted in the form of radio waves by gases in the galaxy and measuring and warping the light ’s waves			2
by taking into account stretching caused by the expansion of the universe , astronomers can work out how long the light ’s journey has taken and so place a galaxy at the right point in cosmic history			2
how it works : this schematic image represents how light from a distant galaxy is distorted by the gravitational effects of a nearer foreground galaxy , which acts like a lens and makes the distant source appear distorted , but brighter , forming characteristic rings of light , known as @entity54 rings			1
an analysis of the distortion has revealed that some of the distant star - forming galaxies are as bright as 40 trillion @entity144 , and have been magnified by the gravitational lens by up to 22 times			2
lead researcher , @entity147 , of the @entity148 in the @entity149 , said : ‘ the more distant the galaxy , the further back in time one is looking , so by measuring their distances we can piece together a timeline of how vigorously the universe was making new stars at different stages in its 13.7billion year history			1
’ the @entity6 observatory , which is part - funded by @entity159 through the @entity160 , was officially launched today			2
# this picture was taken while it was still under construction and so drew on just 16 of the telescope ’s 66 giant radio antennae			0
but when operating at full power , the resulting images should be ten times sharper than those of the @entity25 space telescope			2
to get such pictures from a single land - based radio telescope , it would have to be ten miles wide			0
researcher @entity172 , of the @entity173 , said the results show that ‘ @entity6 is a powerful new player in the field ’			2
@entity178 astronomer professor @entity177 , who wrote an accompanying article for @entity108 , said : ‘ with sharper imaging than the @entity25 , and the ability to measure the different parts of a faraway galaxy independently , @entity6 is starting to give us a much more complete picture of the growth and formation of our universe			1
’ the array of 66 telescopes is being built in @entity2 because it is one of the few places in the world where it is still possible to find a high , dry location unaffected by pollution from artificial light			1
under construction : four of the first @entity6 antennas at the @entity198 ( @entity198 ) , located at 5000 metres altitude on the @entity201 plateau , in the @entity202 of @entity2 radio telescope antennas of the @entity6 ( @entity6 ) project , in the @entity83 desert , some 1500 km north of @entity206 , on march 12,2013			1
how the @entity6 telescope works dryness is particularly important as moisture in the air absorbs the radio waves the dishes are trying to capture			1
speaking at the observatory ’s official opening ceremony , @entity44 president @entity215 , said : ‘ one of our many natural resources is @entity2 ’s spectacular night sky			2
‘ i believe that science has been a vital contributor to the development of @entity2 in recent years			1
i am very proud of our international collaborations in astronomy , of which @entity6 is the latest , and biggest outcome			2
’ @entity6 ’s @entity159 project manager , professor @entity226 , of the @entity160 's @entity227 in @entity228 , said : ‘ the difficulty of constructing an instrument of the scale of @entity6 , and that is located in a challenging environment , should not be underestimated			0
‘ it is a testament to the vision , skill and perseverance of all those involved that not only is construction complete , but early operation is producing outstanding science			0
‘ i am delighted and proud that the @entity159 , through a variety of institutes and organisations participating at various stages of the project 's development and construction , has made a large and very successful contribution to @entity6 , both scientifically and technically			0
‘ the @entity251 founder , the late @entity249 once said that " ...			0
every once in a while a revolutionary product comes along that changes everything ...			0
. and one is very fortunate if you get to work on just one of these in your career '			0
‘ the advent of @entity6 will undoubtedly revolutionise our view of the @entity262 and for me , it represents working on a revolutionary product 66 times over			0
’ dr @entity264 , from @entity265 , and one of two @entity159 scientists who contributed to the nature paper , said : ‘ our study has shown that little more than one billion years after the @entity101 , extreme starburst galaxies in the @entity262 , forming stars at a rate of more than a thousand per year , were a much more commonplace occurrence than previously thought			1
‘ this runs counter to the traditional understanding of massive galaxies forming gradually over much longer periods of time			0
‘ this is a discovery that only @entity6 , with its incredible observing capabilities , could have made			0
’ @entity159 science and engineering has benefited from £ 40million of contracts from @entity6			0
experts at the @entity160 ’s @entity227 in @entity228 made the half - ton cooling systems at the heart of each dish , other contributions include vital software for processing the information gathered by the telescope and material for the actual dishes			0
@entity6 is located 5,000 meters above @entity296 plateau , some 50 km of @entity83 in @entity297 , in @entity202 @entity298 , one of the @entity299 , has captured the antennas of the @entity6 ( @entity6 ) under the southern sky in another breathtaking image			1
