by @entity0 when mum says it 's bedtime , it 's bedtime ... it does n't matter what age you are ! but as any parent knows , it can be easier said than done getting your little one to put their head down - especially when it 's the last thing they want to do			2
that 's exactly what @entity15 the panda found this week when she tried to convince her toddler , @entity17 , that playtime was over and that it was time for bed at @entity21			2
the recalcitrant cub simply would not listen and gave her frustrated mother the slip for a full ten minutes , rolling around and eating bamboo shoots to her heart 's content			1
hard work : @entity15 the panda found it easier said than done getting baby @entity30 to stop messing about and go to bed at @entity21 this week @entity32 - monium : the recalcitrant cub simply would not listen and gave her frustrated mother the slip for a full ten minutes , rolling around eating bamboo shoots to her heart 's content but it was a battle the seven - month - old was never going to win and in the end @entity15 caught her by the scruff and bear - marched her back to bed			1
@entity30 was born to much fanfare at the zoo on july 6 last year , weighing 183.4g and and standing at 15.5cm tall			0
but now she has grown , keepers say she is fast becoming quite the madam and loves nothing more than giving her weary mother the runaround in their enclosure			0
trouble maker : keepers say @entity30 is fast becoming quite the madam and loves nothing more than giving her weary mother the runaround in their enclosure i 'm staying here ! the naughty bear sat stubbornly on her haunches as her mother tried to drag her back to her bed it 's bedtime ! but this was a battle the seven - month - old was never going to win and in the end @entity15 caught her by the scruff and bear - marched her back to bed at last : and finally she managed to get the youngster to bed in their bamboo - branch nest giant pandas are notoriously difficult to breed and it often takes years , if at all , for them to conceive in captivity			1
with fewer than 2,500 giant pandas living free in @entity75 , down largely to deforestation and a growing human population , conservationists are desperate to increase their numbers to boost their dwindling numbers			0
poaching has also been an issue over the years although the @entity75 government has made efforts to reign in illegal hunting of wild animals in recent years .			0

@entity17 gave mother @entity15 the bedtime runaround at @entity21
the 7 - month - old gave mother slip for ten minutes , rolling and eating bamboo
finally @entity15 caught her by the scruff and bear - marched the cub to bed
