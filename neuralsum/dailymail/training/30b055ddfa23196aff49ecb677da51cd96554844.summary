by @entity1 reporter published : 15:14 est , 5 november 2013 updated : 15:14 est , 5 november 2013 the mother of two boys aged four and two who died within months of each other had asked social services to take her children away , an inquest heard today			1
@entity10 of @entity11 , @entity12 , called the local authority to plead for help four weeks before the death of her youngest child , @entity15			1
she told social workers that she could n’t cope and wanted he and his brother to be taken away			0
@entity19 , where @entity10 's two sons , @entity15 , two , and @entity21 , four , were pronounced dead within two months of each other after she had begged social services to take them away the boy had been on the ' at risk ' register since the age of one over fears of neglect			1
but no decision was made to take him into care , the inquest in @entity11 heard			2
in january 2011 , two - year - old @entity15 was pronounced dead at hospital having been admitted limp and unconscious			1
just two months later , in april that year , his brother @entity21 , four , was admitted to @entity19 suffering cardiac arrest , the inquest heard			1
he died three days later			0
only hours earlier he had been deemed fit and healthy by staff at his nursery , while he was also seen less than an hour before being taken to hospital and appeared well			0
that incident involved a group of youths who saw ms @entity10 putting the child outside on a step , where he was crying and upset			2
after @entity21 's death ms @entity10 was arrested on suspicion of murder			1
detectives from @entity12 ’s major crime department said they had had ' strong suspicions ' of foul play			0
detective inspector @entity53 , who led the investigation , told the inquest ms @entity10 , who has learning difficulties , led a chaotic lifestyle and was heavily involved with social services throughout her life			2
but despite extensive enquiries the @entity61 took the decision not to bring criminal proceedings against her			0
the matter was also thrashed out in the @entity66 over a considerable period of time , the inquest heard , because of ongoing care proceedings involving a surviving child			0
as part of that the judge , mr @entity73 , had to decided on the ' balance of probability ' whether ms @entity10 was responsible for the children ’s deaths			2
he found that she was ' neglectful ' , she struggled as a parent , she dished out corporal punishment to the boys , put her own needs before those of @entity21 and @entity15 and struggled to provide appropriate food for them			1
he went on to say she was responsible for ' chronic neglect ' despite receiving considerable support from social services and she was unable to cope with the demands of being a parent			0
he acknowledged there was ‘ a significant possibility that the mother was responsible for the death of the boys ’ but ruled that ultimately the local authority had not been able to prove on the balance of probability that she smothered either child			0
@entity11 coroner @entity99 recorded open verdicts on both deaths			1
he said there were ‘ controversial circumstances ’ surrounding the deaths of both boys that would have long lasting repercussions for those involved .			0
