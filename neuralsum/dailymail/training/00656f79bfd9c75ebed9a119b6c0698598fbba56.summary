the 30 - year - old director of a @entity10 architecture firm watched his physical fitness slip away , along with his body confidence , so as soon as his foot was on the mend he decided to take up an active pastime that would n't put undue stress on his healing fibula : swimming			2

@entity3 , who cut out alcohol from his otherwise healthy diet but did n't make any other changes , said : ' i ca n't believe how different i look and feel in just six weeks and could n't be happier			0
' i put on a lot of weight when i broke my ankle but since starting the swimming training i have dropped from a 36 - inch waist to a 32 - inch			1

' there is a big misconception that swimming is boring and not that effective , but you can mix it up with different equipment to keep things varied and to target specific problem areas			0
' swimming is also great for injury recovery , like in @entity3 's case , as the sport has a high impact on fitness levels but low impact on the joints and can target the specific muscles you need to rebuild			2
