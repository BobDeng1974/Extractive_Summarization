@entity0 insists @entity2 ’s players are not feeling the pressure of trying to give @entity4 a dream send - off – as their captain wo n’t let them entertain such talk			1
victory over @entity9 on wednesday enabled @entity10 ’ squad to set up a date with @entity13 in the @entity15 semi-final next sunday and @entity2 are hot favourites to reach the final			1
the final , against either @entity19 or @entity20 , will be staged on may 30 – @entity4 ’s 35th birthday – and has long been identified as being the perfect afternoon for @entity4 to bring the end down on his glittering @entity25 career			1
@entity0 ( left ) celebrates with @entity26 after @entity2 reached the @entity15 semi-final @entity28 ( right ) scored the winning goal in a tense 1 - 0 quarter - final victory against @entity9 captain @entity4 , who is struggling to get in the side , will leave @entity25 at the end of the season it has created expectation and @entity2 have made heavy weather of getting to the semi-finals but @entity0 , who was outstanding in the 1 - 0 win at @entity39 , maintains they are not thinking too far ahead			1
@entity4 , for one , wo n’t let them get carried away			1
‘ nobody is talking about it , ’ said @entity0			1
@entity44 is the first one to acknowledge that			2
before we speak about the final , we have got to get through the semi-final and that is only possible after getting through here			2
‘ the only thing we can keep in mind now is how to get past @entity13			1
then we will see what comes			2
he is the first one to acknowledge that we ca n’t have any extra pressure on the team ( to give him the dream send - off )			1
he wo n’t let us think in a different way			2
@entity4 celebrates with @entity58 after inspiring @entity2 to victory over @entity60 in the @entity61 the @entity2 captain reacts after the @entity63 are beaten by @entity64 in the @entity65 at @entity66 ‘ we just want to focus on @entity13 and the games before that			1
we have got something to look forward to and we want to make sure that we get to the final			0
that is what we said in the dressing room before the game and everyone did their jobs			0
’ @entity2 last reached the @entity15 final in 2012 , when they lost to @entity64 , and have not won the trophy since @entity4 inspired their 2006 victory over @entity60 in @entity81 but they wo n’t let that opportunity distract their ambitions in the @entity84			1
though they have had their ambitions of finishing in the top four dented by back - to - back defeats against @entity88 and @entity19 , the picture could change once more this weekend if @entity88 win the @entity90 derby and @entity2 beat @entity91 on monday			1
@entity2 have seen their form slip in the league with consecutive defeats to @entity88 and @entity19 ( above ) ‘ we are pleased to get to the semi-final , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ once it is semi-final time , we will make sure we are ready			0
but everything comes step by step			0
we are pleased with what we did against @entity9 but the next focus is the league			0
‘ we will be ready and focused then to make sure we get to the final			0
the only thing we can do is focus and keep our heads down			0
we have got to keep doing the things we are doing			0
there is still a lot to play for			2
the only thing that we can do is take every game as it comes			0
‘ when you are at @entity2 , you know you have to win every single game			2
after the results against @entity19 and @entity88 , we knew there was going to be criticism			0
the only thing you can do is respond and we did that			0
now the focus is on @entity91			0
we will do our best to get three points			0

@entity2 are set to play @entity13 in @entity15 semi-finals on april 19
@entity4 will leave @entity25 for @entity125 at end of the season
