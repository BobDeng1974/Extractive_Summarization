when @entity1 let his five friends plan a stag do , he might have imagined it would involve pranks , costumes and drinking - but denim hotpants and heels were far from his thoughts			1
little did he realise his friends from @entity10 , south @entity11 , were inspired by the hilarious @entity13 advert , featuring a man dressed in shirt and jacket from the waist up and tight booty shorts and stilettos from the waist down			2
when the men in their matching outfits walked down the street in @entity25 , @entity26 , they earned cheers , clapping and even policemen driving past waved and laughed			1
@entity30 snaps the gang , from left to right : @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 , groom @entity1 and his father @entity35 @entity30 , 38 , who filmed the stag stunt , said : ‘ we were in our local pub planning the stag weekend			1
‘ we decided that whatever the first advert was that came on the tv , that was what we were going to do			2
’ the @entity13 advert featuring ' @entity46 's epic strut ' came on			0
@entity30 said : ' everyone thought it would be a head - turner			0
’ the next step for the group was to buy some high heels , and @entity30 admitted the men asked their other halves for help in purchasing the right shoes			1
each of the men dress in high heels and the video maker noted that some of them were walking ' too well ' @entity34 channels @entity46 's ' epic strut ' from the original ad that quickly went viral he added : ‘ a couple of them were walking a bit too well in their high heels			1
it looked like they had been practising			0
’ wearing heels earned them blisters along with laughs and attention from the crowds the group of six - which included the groom - to - be @entity1 and his stags @entity33 , @entity80 , @entity34 , dad @entity35 and @entity30 - descended on the promenade of the @entity26 resort on march 29			1
@entity30 captured them strutting their stuff on his camera phone			2
they each wear suits from the waist up with braces over their shirts and denim hot pants and high heels from the waist down			1
in the video , the men mimic the advert , walking towards the camera in a line of five , with groom @entity1 in the middle , pulling a variety of humorous poses from the tv commercial			1
later in the video the stag do can be seen garnering much attention from locals , holiday goers and even the police			1
mr @entity30 said : ‘ the whole promenade was at a standstill			0
people were cheering and clapping and all different nationalities stood around to watch and take photos			0
‘ a police car went past and i was trying to get them to beep their sirens			0
they waved and laughed – they were fine			0
‘ i ’ve been on many stag weekends and this was probably one of the best			2
we could n’t believe the attention			0
' the stag do garnered a lot of attention from locals , other holiday goers and even the police unfortunately for the group however , who wore their outfits from 1pm until 7pm , there were repercussions and the men each had sore feet to contend with for the rest of the trip			1
‘ we joked before we left saying that someone was bound to break their ankle			0
luckily no one did , but they all got blisters , ’ said @entity30			2
according to the filmmaker , the group have already made plans to go on a fishing trip to @entity146 in the near future			0
the original ad stars @entity150 @entity149 , who has been forced to deny he 's had buttock implants , insisting his bottom is all natural			2
in the ad he struts and twerks to the @entity155 ' hit @entity154 .			0
