desperate search : @entity1 , 20 , has been missing for two years with very few leads into what happened to the 20 - year - old @entity11 student still missing : student @entity1 went missing on june 3 , 2011 after a night of partying with college friends in @entity13 , @entity11 the @entity29 told the @entity30 on monday : ' we are appalled that the @entity32 have defamed our daughter knowing that @entity15 will never have the opportunity to respond			1
' their outrage came after @entity37 and @entity38 , whose son @entity39 was dating the young woman at the time she disappeared , called the @entity29 ' liars ' last week , adding : ' this poor little girl is not with us today because of her drug abuse			2
' the couple said that they were defending their son against the constant public scrutiny and calls from the @entity17 family for @entity39 , and three other young men who were the last to see @entity15 , to come forward with information			1
focus : @entity20 , @entity1 's boyfriend at the time of her disappearance , has passed a private polygraph test the @entity59 ' explained that the reason their son had not taken a police polygraph is because they did not trust law enforcement in the town			1
they told the paper that their son passed a private polygraph test			1
one of the young men who was last to see @entity15 , @entity67 , told investigators that she may have told him she had snorted a prescription drug on june 3 , 2011			1
he also claimed that @entity72 and a friend @entity73 had taken cocaine - but no evidence has been found of this allegation			2
police have given no further information on whether investigators have made any progress into what happened to the 20 - year - old two years ago			1
her parents say they still believe someone will eventually reveal what happened to her			0
@entity16 and @entity17 say it would be devastating to never find their daughter even though they assume she is dead			0
@entity90 answers : this surveillance photo is the last known image of @entity15			2
several of the people to see her last have hired lawyers and stopped fully cooperating the @entity29 have maintained since soon after @entity15 vanished in the early hours of june 3 , 2011 , in downtown @entity13 that several of the people who were with her that night have n't fully cooperated with police			1
' there 's a sense that someday , some week things will change for us			0
that someone will have the strength , the crisis of conscience to come forward , ' @entity101 told @entity106 of @entity13			2
the 20 - year - old apparel merchandising major from @entity108 , @entity109 , could have graduated with her college class last month			1
@entity11 president @entity111 asked those attending the commencement ceremony to keep @entity72 and her family in their thoughts			2
@entity13 police officials wo n't comment on the search other than to say the department has received more than 3,000 tips , with some 160 of those coming in this year			1
' there 's only so many ways you can say we continue to investigate , ' police captain @entity122 told the @entity30			2
' we will not talk about people			0
we will not talk about evidence			0
we will not talk about the investigatory plan			0
' @entity16 and @entity17 spent weeks in @entity13 after their daughter disappeared , and hundreds of volunteers joined searches around the city and parts of the surrounding wooded countryside that is dotted with old limestone quarries and lakes			2
although many of @entity1 's friends and classmates have left @entity13 , there were rejuvenated efforts in april to rebuild signs and hang new posters to keep up awareness about her disappearance			1
@entity13 firefighters rebuilt 20 large , wooden - framed signs to replace the weathered billboards that were first erected two years ago			1
members of a @entity153 invited the public to distribute and hang new posters and fliers			0
' we do have local support , ' @entity101 said			0
' her presence is in @entity13			2
' the three young men who were last seen with @entity15 said earlier this month that her parents are harassing them for information about their daughter 's whereabouts			1
one of the young men who was seen carrying her out of a restaurant towards his house is saying that the @entity29 are harassing him by repeatedly calling him demanding information that he claims he does not have			0
' we ’ve done nothing wrong			0
if we ’d done something wrong , we would have been arrested already			0
all they ’re doing is hurting my career , ' said one of those men @entity182			0
desperate search : @entity17 , left , has kept the pressure on in the hunt for her missing daughter @entity15 ' it ’s inappropriate the way they ’re harassing people that are also victims in this case , ' he told the @entity30			2
@entity182 told the paper that he has had to field phone calls from reporters , the @entity17 's lawyers , and the @entity29 themselves , though the parents deny that they ever called the young men themselves			2
' @entity201 and i have never spoken to @entity182 , ' @entity15 's mother @entity200 said to the paper			1
' the private investigators have never spoken to @entity182			0
so i do n’t know how it is we ’re harassing him other than asking him to talk to the @entity13 police department			1
' @entity182 is involved in the case is because he accompanied @entity15 to a bar , and then back to her apartment at a building called @entity214			1
while there , he was punched in the face by another student			0
his lawyer has previously said that @entity182 does not remember anything after the punch , but the building 's surveillance footage shows @entity182 helping @entity17 out of the building in the direction of his own apartment			0
plea for information : @entity1 's mother @entity200 asks the public to help find out what happened to her daughter , two years after she went missing in @entity13 , @entity11 @entity182 , his roommate @entity230 , and their neighbor @entity67 are the final three people to see her alive			1
the article in the @entity30 paints @entity182 as defensive , as he said the following when a reporter called him at work : ' what do you think , i ’m doing drugs now ? no , i ’m at work			0
do n’t ever call again			0
if you contact me again , you ’re going to hear from my lawyer			0
either way , you ’re going to hear from my lawyer			0
' no arrests have been made in relation to the young woman 's disappearance			0
the search for @entity15 has taken one frustrating turn after another			2
when the investigation began two years ago , five of her male friends , who police believed could have offered insight into the final moments before her disappearance hired criminal defense lawyers and stopped fully cooperating with police			0
speaking on @entity264 ’s daytime talk show in december , @entity15 ’s parents said that their daughter ’s friends are impeding the search for her			1
they hypothesized that the friends have made a pact of silence			0
‘ despite their claims of doing whatever they could do , the fact of the matter is they refuse to meet with us … they refuse to take a police polygraph , which we feel is important for a number of reasons , ’ mr @entity101 said .			1

the 20 - year - old @entity11 student was last seen on june 3 , 2011 after going to a local bar in @entity13
parents of @entity15 's boyfriend @entity20 said their son would not take a police polygraph test because they did not trust local *authorities*
