it 's a dog 's life that 's actually closer to a human 's life			0
forget doggy shoes and ' hair ' salons , the latest must - have for dog owners is a subscription to a special canine tv channel			2
filmmakers are calling @entity12 a new breed of television - an eight - hour block of on - demand cable tv programming designed to keep your dog relaxed , stimulated and entertained while you are at work			1
to get the right footage , cameramen got on their knees and shot low and long			2
' i shot from the point of view of the dog , ' said @entity28 , chief executive officer of @entity12			1
unique : filmmakers are calling @entity12 a new breed of television - an eight - hour block of on - demand cable tv programming designed to keep your dog relaxed , stimulated and entertained while you are at work in production , they had to mute colors , alter sound and add music specially written for dogs			1
there will be no commercials , no ratings and no reruns , although some might argue that watching a slug crawl is hardly exciting new programming			0
one million subscribers with two cable companies have access to @entity12 in @entity53			1
it is doing so well that parent company @entity55 plans to offer it nationally in the next several months , @entity28 said			0
it will cost about $ 4.99 a month , @entity28 said			0
if you figure more than 46 million @entity61 households have dogs ( according to the @entity63 ) and 97 percent of @entity61 homes have televisions , the future looks promising			2
@entity67 , a year - old @entity69 bulldog , has been watching for a month and snorts and grunts his approval , owner @entity66 of @entity53 said			2
he used to perk up when @entity73 came on , @entity66 said , but he seems more intrigued by @entity12			1
curious : the dogs will watch footage of things the experience on a day to day basis , such as traffic or other dogs stimulating : new technologies like digital tv , high - definition cameras , and enhanced production have changed the way dogs perceive the images , while big screens allow them to see from anywhere in a room ' i always feel guilty leaving him alone all day when i 'm at work , ' @entity66 said			1
' he 's like my kid			0
i do n't have any children so i really treat him like my child			2
anything that makes him happy makes me happy			0
' for years , pet owners have been leaving a television or radio on when they go out so their pets have company , said dr. @entity107 , director of the @entity108 in @entity109 at @entity110 at @entity111 in @entity112			0
but @entity107 said that according to research on the canine brain , with analog television , dogs could only see a flickering screen			2
new technologies like digital tv , high - definition cameras , and enhanced production have changed the way dogs perceive the images , while big screens allow them to see from anywhere in a room , @entity28 said			1
do dogs really understand what they 're watching ? @entity107 said research is ongoing , but it appears that dogs not only recognize other dogs on tv , they may even respond differently to their own breed			0
they definitely recognize sounds , though , whether it 's barking or sirens , and audio on @entity12 has been tailored accordingly			1
a dog 's best friend : to get the right footage , cameramen got on their knees and shot low and long so that the angles were from a dog 's point of view technical : based on dog sleeping pattern studies , programmers alternate footage and soundtracks designed for stimulation , relaxation and exposure throughout the eight hours because high frequency sounds can be very irritating to dogs , they 've been removed			1
and music is written and tailored for their hearing , though it sounds like elevator music to humans			0
what you wo n't find on @entity12 are the sounds that blare on regular tv : no gunshots , no explosions , no heavy metal music , @entity28 said			1
dogs can see blue and yellow , but not red or green , @entity28 said , so colors are altered for @entity12 too			1
based on dog sleeping pattern studies , programmers alternate footage and soundtracks designed for stimulation , relaxation and exposure throughout the eight hours			1
exposure is designed to acquaint dogs with things they will see each day			1
' there are studies that show when young puppies are exposed to video images of other dogs , it acts as a form of socialization , ' @entity107 said			2
sights and sounds during this part of the programming expose the animals to things like traffic , babies , other pets and doorbells			0
relaxation segments feature sleeping dogs and nature scenes - like the slugs - accompanied by dog lullabies			1
stimulation includes dogs running , playing and surfing , animation and a lot of panting			0
the idea behind this part of @entity12 is to get a dog moving , even if it is home alone			2
shows are ' refreshed ' daily for variety			0
fancy that : dogs can see blue and yellow , but not red or green , so colors are altered for @entity12 too there has been a lot of feedback from viewers saying their cats like the show as well as their dogs , @entity28 said			1
@entity226 may be added later , but @entity12 is strictly for the dogs , he said			1
the @entity229 , on the outskirts of @entity53 , is n't wired for cable yet , but @entity12 offered to give them relaxation - only test videos			1
' we handle 5,000 animals a year			0
we get high - energy , big dogs that need to calm down			2
when we plugged it in , we saw almost immediate results , ' said development director @entity238			0
if an extremely active dog is confined for long periods of time , a chemical imbalance can occur and it can go kennel crazy , @entity238 said			0
you can prevent that with @entity12 and 20 - minute walks twice a day , she said			1
every dog at the shelter ca n't see a tv , but they are all within hearing distance and that 's helping too , @entity238 said			0
pets may one day be able to sniff @entity12 , @entity107 said			1
' the technology is here to add smell			0
there are boxes you can buy that have 60 different wells that you can fill with scents			0
like fireworks , you can cue them with what 's on television			0
' too bad they ca n't control the remote .			0

' relaxation ' shows include footage of a snail crawling along the ground while the stimulating programmes show dogs *cavorting* around
pooches wo n't have to put up with *repeats* or commercial breaks - there are n't any !
creators hope that one day dogs will be able to sniff @entity12
