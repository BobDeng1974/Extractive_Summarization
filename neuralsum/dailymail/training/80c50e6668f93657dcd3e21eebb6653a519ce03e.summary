it was n't the most inspired chant you 'll ever hear in a football ground , but it was topical and certainly cutting			0
' @entity5 , he sleeps when he wants , ' sang the @entity8 fans during the opening minutes at @entity10 in reference to the ' @entity13 ' affair			2
and , in the first - half at least , it neatly summarised @entity16 - and @entity5 's - slumbering performance			1
but the most scrutinised and talked - about teenager in the game was certainly alert and awake when it mattered to help the @entity21 to a much - needed victory late on			0
videos scroll down to watch ... @entity5 celebrates with @entity24 after @entity25 scores an own goal for the winner @entity5 ( left ) and @entity28 celebrate after @entity25 puts through his own net in stoppage time @entity5 plays in the cross that @entity25 put into his own net for the winner deep into stoppage time @entity5 sets off in pursuit of the ball as @entity16 try to assert themselves at @entity10 @entity5 attempts to get beyond @entity8 's @entity37 during the first - half at @entity10 first , @entity5 was pretty much in a sleeping position on the turf when he nudged a free - kick short to @entity42 after 67 minutes , catching the still - protesting @entity8 defenders out			1
the right - back crossed low and dangerously , with @entity45 kindly supplying the finishing touch for the 10th own goal of his @entity49 life - a most unflattering record			1
and then , after @entity52 had brought @entity8 level with three minutes remaining , it was @entity5 who , with trademark acceleration , carried @entity16 forward on the counter			1
the move culminated with @entity57 , on as a substitute , curling the ball home to restore @entity16 's lead as the clock ticked over into stoppage time			1
@entity5 walks off the pitch after a tough first half in which @entity16 struggled to make an impression @entity5 is held back by @entity67 as @entity24 tries to win the ball for @entity16 @entity68 over as the pair fight for the ball but the drama was n't over yet			1
@entity71 for his third influential act after @entity52 had brought @entity8 back to 2 - 2			1
there were sparks coming from his heels as he sprinted down the left channel , sending in the low cross that @entity25 turned into his own net for the decisive goal			1
they were three pieces of sharp - thinking you certainly would n't associate with a man feeling fatigued from the strain of carrying responsibility for club and country			0
with hindsight , perhaps it was n't the best idea to inspire him with that chant			0
@entity5 was excellent here once he was wound up			2
the @entity96 international is slide challenged by @entity98 close to the touchline as he tries to attack @entity16 manager @entity100 congratulates @entity5 at the final whistle @entity5 's heat map at the end of the first half shows how he struggled to make an impression but his heat map at the end of the match shows how he influenced things after the break passes : 45 passing accuracy : 77.8 per cent duels won : 13 duels lost : 4 recoveries : 11 tackles : 5 fouls won : 2 chances created : 3 @entity5 dominated the headlines during the international fortnight after asking @entity96 manager @entity120 to leave him out the starting line - up for the @entity123 qualifier in @entity124			1
that chat , and @entity120 's decision to disclose it , sparked endless debate but on the evidence of this sunny afternoon in west @entity130 , @entity5 is looking not only fresh but on the top of his game			2
it would be interesting to know @entity120 's thoughts as he sat alongside @entity8 chief @entity135 and local hero @entity136 high in the stands			2
he had come to make peace with @entity16 boss @entity100 after the latest unedifying club vs country war of words			2
@entity5 has looked energetic in training all week and it 's easily forgotten amid the hubris that he played the last half - hour and made an impact in @entity146 , winning the free - kick from which @entity148 scored the winner			1
prior to this match , @entity5 had played 1,967 minutes during this calendar year , more than any other player under the age of 21			2
burn - out affects even the precocious but @entity100 had no hesitation in throwing him in			0
' he felt fantastic to play so i 'm looking forward to him getting on and showing how good he is , ' said @entity100 on @entity157 before the match			0
@entity96 manager @entity120 was sat next to @entity8 chairman @entity135 in the stands @entity5 chats to @entity160 during the pre-match warm - ups in west @entity130 the young mascots give @entity163 a guard of honour as he walks out on to the pitch @entity163 criticism unfair - @entity100 unfortunately in the opening 45 minutes he looked as lost and languid as the rest of the @entity16 team			1
the @entity172 @entity171 contained him with ease and he was snuffed out every time he attempted to break away			0
there was one intelligent through pass in the direction of @entity160 , whose failure to reach it was symptomatic of his disappointing afternoon			0
at one point , he was outpaced by @entity67 despite being nearer to a loose ball			0
it epitomised @entity16 's first - half funk			1
but he was a changed man and they were a changed team after the break			0
the tempo was raised , passes were crisper , crosses lethal , as @entity185 found to his embarrassment			0
the game hung in the balance right until the final peep of @entity191 's whistle but @entity5 made the difference as the best and the brightest players do			2
' it 's always good to play football , it was no different this week , ' he said modestly afterwards			0
he 'll be glad a tricky week is over - and with the perfect ending .			0

@entity5 was influential as @entity16 won 3 - 2 at @entity8

and his low cross was turned in by @entity25 for the winner
