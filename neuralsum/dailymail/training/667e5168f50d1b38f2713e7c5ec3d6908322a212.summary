i only took one lens			0
it is the lens for pictures in the medium to far distance			0

' it was quite a long sequence i had to go through to switch it on and start recording , switch the viewfinder on and try and find the subject then focus manually with my hand in the bag			0
so i had gone through this and by which time had changed my mind and decided not to film			0
i switched it off and carried on walking			0
' then i saw a man run across the street shouting " i 'm detaining you for voyeurism " and i believed he must have been watching me earlier in the day when i had recorded the footage			0
he saw me fiddling with my bag and then i switched it off			0
' the phrase legs , skirt and body came from the security man			2
