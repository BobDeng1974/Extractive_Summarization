by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 18:15 est , 17 june 2012 updated : 02:46 est , 18 june 2012 a paralysed man who goes to court tomorrow to win the right to die is at the centre of an extraordinary @entity7 campaign to get him to change his mind			2
days after @entity9 – who can communicate only by moving his eyelids – posted his first tweet , strangers from around the world have begun bombarding him with pro-life messages			1
tweets to mr @entity9 , which can be seen publicly , state ‘ @entity18 loves you ’ and try to persuade him to ‘ hang in there ’			1
one urges him that he must change his mind , if not for himself , ‘ for your children ’			2
court plea : @entity9 , 58 , pictured with his wife @entity23 , suffers from ' locked - in ' syndrome will find out later if the @entity25 has thrown out his case seeking a right to assisted suicide mr @entity9 , 58 , is seeking to make legal history by challenging the government over the right to die			1
he has suffered from locked - in syndrome since a stroke on a business trip in @entity34 in 2005			2
while his mind was unaffected , his condition has meant he has spent most of the past seven years alone in his room and unable to communicate with family and friends			0
in a landmark case , he and his family are due to go to the @entity25 to argue that a doctor should lawfully be allowed to end his life			0
mr @entity9 began using social networking site @entity7 on wednesday			1
his first message read : ‘ @entity48			0
i am @entity9 , i have locked - in syndrome and this is my first ever tweet			1
’ it is thought that he is the first person in the world to tweet with his eyelids , using a computer system which tracks his blinks to translate his thoughts into written words			0
his posts have provided a fascinating insight into the life of someone trapped inside their own body			0
response : strangers from around the world have contacted @entity9 with pro-life messages campaign : within days of posting his first tweet , people began contacting @entity9 , who has ' locked - in syndrome ' , with pro-life messages in one , he wrote : ‘ @entity71 had an old school friend call in for a chat with us but mostly @entity23 [ his wife ] because she can speak			1
still , it was nice to see him			0
’ he amassed almost 14,000 followers in just five days – but while some have supported his fight , many who believe he should not be allowed to ask a doctor to kill him have used the site to try convince him to change his mind			0
one user , writing under the name @ llanguages , wrote : ‘ hi @entity9 , i will pray that you will reconsider as every life is a celebration			1
if not for yourself , do it for your children			0
’ another added : ‘ everything happens for a reason			0
please @entity9 , fight to live			1
’ one @entity7 user from the @entity95 has started sending him links to websites for charities which offer physical therapy to help those suffering from paralysis			0
another wrote : ‘ you hang in there and do what ’s right ’ , while many messages mentioned the will of @entity18			0
urged : @entity9 has been bombarded with messages on @entity7 urging him to change his mind about seeking the right to die @entity110 wrote : ‘ @entity18 has a plan and a purpose why these [ sic ] happens in your life			1
be a good example and an inspiration to everyone			0
’ in response to the more supportive messages received by her father , mr @entity9 ’s daughter @entity123 wrote on the site : ‘ loving how much support my dad @ @entity127 is getting			1
his choice , his life , his rights			0
’ at the @entity25 tomorrow , lawyers for mr @entity9 will argue that it is necessary to allow a doctor to kill him because forcing him to stay alive would be worse			1
mr @entity9 is too severely disabled to take his own life			1
today in an article for @entity136 , mr @entity9 , who writes with the aid of eyeball - tracking computer technology , describes the extreme frustration he experiences			1
he said : ' at 8.30 the day - carers arrived and shaved , showered and dressed me , supervised my exercise and left			0
' being manhandled is a necessary part of the process and it reminded me of why i am going to court ; i would hate all of this when i am old and would want a way to make it stop			2
' among those who support the legal battle is neurologist dr @entity152 , who saved mr @entity9 ’s life after he had a stroke			1
on a @entity158 , programme about mr @entity9 ’s case which will air tonight , dr @entity155 said : ‘ death is more normal than to stay alive in this condition			2
so when i was informed that he was still alive i was surprised and sad also			0
i would n’t like for even for my worst enemy to stay alive in this condition for so many years			0
’ earlier this year , an independent commission on assisted dying concluded for the first time that certain people should be helped to die			1
but this only applies to those who are terminally ill and are able to take the final action to end their lives themselves – which excludes mr @entity9			2
some campaigners have objected to the way mr @entity9 has been bombarded with outspoken messages on @entity7			2
a spokesman for campaign group @entity178 , which does not entirely support mr @entity9 ’s case , said they hoped ‘ people will be respectful of mr @entity9 on @entity7 regardless of whether they agree with him or not ’ .			2

@entity9 , 58 , is seeking to make legal history by changing the government *'s* *policy* on assisted dying
