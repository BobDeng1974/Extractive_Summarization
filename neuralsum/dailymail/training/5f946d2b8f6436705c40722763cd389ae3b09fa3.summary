by @entity0 published : 07:06 est , 28 september 2012 updated : 18:54 est , 28 september 2012 beleaguered : @entity1 , the @entity2 chief whip , says his anti-police image is unfair @entity1 yesterday said his verbal assault on @entity7 police had been ‘ blown out of proportion ’			1
the @entity2 chief whip also claimed he did not use the words ‘ pleb ’ and ‘ moron ’ in the clash with protection officers who would not let him cycle through the street ’s main gate last week			1
in an interview with his local paper , mr @entity1 also sought to paint himself as a friend of the police who visits their station in his constituency at @entity23 to thank them for their efforts			1
he blamed a ' long and extremely frustrating day ' for his rant , and says he has apologised to all concerned so wants to get on with his job			0
but to further undermine mr @entity1 ’s explanation for his rant , however , it later emerged the day in question included lunch at @entity32 ’s poshest curry house , the @entity33			0
' i hope my constituents and friends in @entity37 will not recognise the hideous caricature that has been portrayed in some of the tabloid press , ' he told his local paper the @entity40			1
' i have an excellent relationship with the police whom i know well and whom i always go to see at christmas time to thank for their services to the people of @entity49			2
' i go round the police station and thank all the police who are on duty before @entity23 for keeping us safe and sound throughout the year , ' adding he has ' a tremendously close and warm relationship with them '			1
two - wheeled terror : mr @entity1 had reportedly been stopped from riding his bike out of a gate when he launched the outburst at police altercation : mr @entity1 got in a row after police asked him to go via the side gate of @entity7 , but he wanted to go through the main larger one after the incident @entity66 called him in for a face - to - face meeting and told mr @entity1 his behaviour was unacceptable			2
he ' looked him in the eye ' , insisting he did n't use the word , sources said			0
mr @entity66 has since read an official police log showing he called officers ' f * * * * * * plebs ' , but is expected to stand by mr @entity1			1
the police log states : ‘ there were several members of public present as is the norm opposite the pedestrian gate and as we neared it , mr @entity1 said : “ best you learn your f * * * * * * place ... you do n't run this f * * * * * * @entity86 ... you 're * * * * * * * plebs			1
” claims : mr @entity1 has constantly denied using the words attributed to him in a police report ‘ the members of public looked visibly shocked and i was somewhat taken aback by the language used and the view expressed by a senior government official			2
i can not say if this statement was aimed at me individually , or the officers present or the police service as a whole			2
’ the chief whip has again gone through his version of events and denied the police report was accurate			1
' on wednesday night i tried to leave @entity7 by the main gate , something i have done many times before			2
' i was told that i was not allowed to leave that way			0
during the subsequent altercation , although i did not use the specific words that have been suggested , i do accept that i did not treat the police with the respect they deserve			0
' i have apologised profusely to the police officer involved and to the supervising sergeant			0
' it ’s been extremely difficult both for me and my family			0
i have apologised and said that i am extremely sorry			0
i think most people who know me know i would not use words like pleb or moron in describing anyone			0
i would gently point out that i did not say the words that have been ascribed to me			0
' mr @entity1 confirmed that he will be returning to his constituency ' shortly ' and is looking forward to getting back to his two roles as mp and chief whip - a position he says is ' evolving ' .			1

the chief whip says he has a ' close and warm relationship ' with officers in his @entity37 constituency
' i go round the police station and thank all the police who are on duty before @entity23 for keeping us safe and sound throughout the year , ' he said
in a new interview he *refused* to resign and again denies calling @entity7 police ' f * * * * * * plebs '
' i hope my constituents and friends will not recognise the hideous caricature that has been portrayed in some of the tabloid press '
