by @entity0 this is the terrifying moment a scuba diver looks up from trying to catch a fish to find himself caught in a battle with a shark			1
@entity6 was looking for lionfish in the @entity8 when the predator approached , in an encounter which ' scared the cr * p ' out of him			1
mr @entity13 , who was carrying a short spear , stabs frantically at the beast as it circles underneath him			0
it moves in several times to try and snap at him , but he manages to keep it at bay			0
but the beast follows him , and is caught on camera swimming directly towards mr @entity13 with its jaws wide open			0
aiming the spear downward between his legs , the diver is able again to scare the shark off , and at one point makes contact with the animal 's face			1
the video , caught on mr @entity13 's @entity42 3 camera , was uploaded to @entity43 last thursday and has been viewed hundreds of thousands of times			1
unsuspecting : the tip of the shark 's fin can be seen as mr @entity13 looks up from catching a lionfish battle : he manages to keep the shark at bay as it circles below in the description of the video , he writes : ' we were @entity57 when the shark came out of no ware [ sic ]			1
it scared the crap out of me ... we were in about 70 ' of water when the shark encounter occurred			1
he continued : ' i love this place and will continue diving here for the rest of my life			2
in no way did this encounter discourage me from getting back into the water			0
ï»¿ ' i want to make it clear that i am hunting lion fish to help protect the reef from the destruction that they cause			0
the shark was acting in his natural environment			2
' i have no ill will toward him and will get back in the water and continue to protect the reef for future generations			0
' round two : even after he swims towards the surface , the shark returns to make another attempt back off ! the shark swerves away as mr @entity13 jabs at it with the spear contact : he scores a glancing blow , which causes the fish to turn tail and leave him alone			2

@entity98 was diving in the @entity8 when the shark approached
he managed to fend the predator off , and uploaded the *footage* to @entity43
