with her husband still recuperating after his recent abdominal surgery , the @entity0 had to rely on the company of her faithful canine companions when she arrived in @entity5 on holiday today			1
dressed in a pink raincoat and familiar flowered headscarf , the monarch flew up from @entity10 to @entity11 in a private jet to begin her two - month @entity14 break at @entity15			1
this year , however , she will spend the first few weeks of her holiday alone as her 92 - year - old husband is still recuperating from recent abdominal surgery			1
the @entity0 touched down at @entity19 this afternoon wearing a pink outfit she arrived without prince @entity21 who is still recuperating at @entity22 following abdominal surgery after spending several weeks with his wife at @entity27 , the 92 - year - old has now moved to @entity22 , the @entity0 ’s private @entity28 estate , where he continues to recover			1
doctors have given him the all - clear to join the monarch but he will make his own way up in mid-august , palace sources have revealed			2
‘ the @entity21 plans to join the @entity0 in @entity15 in august , ’ they said			1
although the @entity0 ’s 50,000 acre private estate is remote , medics are clearly confident that if the doughty duke does feel poorly , he can still be swiftly treated			0
indeed , last august @entity21 was admitted to the @entity40 for treatment of his recurring bladder infection after falling ill at the royal residence			2
sources also confirmed that he still hoped to resume some ‘ light duties ’ , including public engagements , later in the autumn			0
@entity21 ’s decision to move to @entity22 alone for the time being , however , will , inevitably , spark further fears for his health			2
however , she was not alone as this picture shows - one of her staff carries a corgi down the steps off the plane and onto the tarmac the corgis travel with her majesty to all her residences and she tries to look after them herself as much as possible given her busy schedule he was admitted to @entity66 last month – his fourth hospital stay in just 18 months – for an ‘ exploratory operation following abdominal investigations ’			1
a source said at the time : ‘ the @entity21 underwent abdominal tests last week and was told a few days ago that he needed to have an exploratory operation			1
‘ he was admitted to hospital by arrangement and left quite calmly - and without any panic - after a garden party , where appeared in particularly good form			0
’ he was discharged 10 days later and announced he would take two months off from public duties to recuperate			0
@entity80 have never revealed the results of his tests , citing medical confidentiality			0
last year the @entity21 was twice hospitalised with a serious bladder infection during the @entity86 celebrations and missed a number of key events			1
and at @entity90 in 2011 , he was rushed to hospital for emergency heart surgery after suffering a blocked artery while staying at @entity22			0
doctors fitted him with a stent to relieve the problem			0
@entity21 is already the longest - serving consort in @entity99 history and the oldest serving partner of a reigning monarch			1
jet - set passengers : the queen at @entity19 on her way to @entity15 , with her corgi peeking out of the window he has already scaled back on all but his most important patronages but still carries out more than 350 engagements a year , making him one of the hardest - working members of the @entity111			1
at the moment he is the only senior member of the royal family not to have met the latest addition to the royal family , baby @entity116			0
@entity21 enjoys a particularly close relationship with his grandson , prince @entity119 – the pair often shoot together – and it is certain the new parents will want him to meet their son as soon as possible			1
yesterday neither @entity80 or @entity124 could suggest when that might be , however			0
‘ it is a private matter , ’ they both said			0
but well - placed sources suggest the @entity21 and @entity129 may try to see him in @entity28 before he flies up to @entity5 to join his wife			2
last week the @entity0 revealed that she was desperate for her new great - grandson to arrive before she left to go to @entity15			2
glamorous transport : the @entity0 and her corgis , who are used to travelling around the country with her , arrived in style by private plane on an engagement in the @entity140 , she told schoolgirl @entity141 : ‘ i would very much like it to arrive because i 'm going on holiday soon			0
’ fortunately he arrived on monday and she was able to spend 30 minutes with him at @entity146 on wednesday morning			0
as always with the @entity0 , her beloved dogs went with her too - and could be seen being carried off the plane by her servants			2
at present the sovereign owns two @entity151 : @entity152 and @entity153 ( who found instant fame when they appeared in last year ’s @entity158 skit filmed for the opening of the @entity160 ) and two @entity161 : @entity162 and @entity163			1
the palace website say of her pets : ‘ @entity0 ’s corgis travel with her to the various residences , with her majesty looking after them herself as much as possible given her busy schedule			0

92 - year - old prince @entity21 is still recuperating from abdominal surgery
the queen was kept company by her beloved corgis , @entity152 and @entity153
she will spend two months of the summer up at @entity15
