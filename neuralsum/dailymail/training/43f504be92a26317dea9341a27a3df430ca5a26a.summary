a police officer who visited a hospital after a dying patient made a 999 call begging for a drink told an inquest he witnessed nursing staff ignoring his requests for water			1
@entity10 @entity9 , who visited @entity11 after the emergency call at @entity13 in @entity14 , south @entity15 , said he heard the patient twice ask for a drink but no water was brought			1
@entity11 , 22 , lost more than a third of his body fluid while recovering from a hip operation at @entity13 in @entity14 , southwest @entity15			1
he needed vital medication to help his body retain fluid and resorted to phoning 999 to beg for a drink			1
officers arrived at @entity11 's bedside , but were told by nurses that he was in a confused state and were sent away			1
hospital : @entity11 , 22 , pictured with his mother @entity31 , needed drugs to regulate his hormone levels after successfully beating brain cancer			1
however , during a hospital stay nurses forgot to give him his medication the keen footballer and runner from @entity39 , died of dehydration a few hours later			0
he said mr @entity11 had stuck out his tongue and asked : ‘ does this look like a dry mouth ? ’ before asking the nurses for a drink			2
he told @entity46 : ' @entity11 shouted to the nursing staff " can i have some water ? " there was no water by his bedside and i asked him again to explain why he had called police			1
' he stated that he kept asking for water but they would n't give it to him			0
he was complaining of a dry mouth			0
' the officer and his colleague left after doctors reassured him mr @entity11 had a history of erratic behaviour following a brain tumour he had suffered the year before			2
but the inquest has heard no evidence that mr @entity11 was given any water			2
the inquest heard earlier that specialist doctors at the hospital who had been treating @entity11 for a year and knew of his rare medical needs were not even told he was in the building until after he died			1
‘ the guidelines say if patients come in , you call us - bleep and we are always available ’ , said @entity73 , the consultant endocrinologist in charge of his treatment			0
‘ the best way is to call us because we know the patients			0
it would be very difficult not to find us			0
’ mr @entity11 had just been given the all - clear from a malignant brain tumour when he was admitted to @entity13 ’s on may 25 , 2009			1
the inquest heard mr @entity11 ’s hip had been weakened by steroid ’s during the tumour treatment , and he needed a replacement operation			1
dr @entity73 was on leave when mr @entity11 was admitted but none of her colleagues in the endocrinology department , who knew of his specialist medical needs , were told he was there			1
inquest : @entity99 , left , and @entity11 's father @entity100 arriving at their son 's inquest			2
@entity31 told the court she had tried to convince the staff at the hospital her son needed urgent attention but they insisted he was alright ‘ i wanted him to have the operation at @entity13 ’s so i could be involved in his care ’ , said dr @entity73			1
‘ i would see him before the operation and daily afterwards			0
‘ he had a rare tumour and was on a large amount of hormone replacements			0
in my opinion , there needed to be looked after by an endocrinologist afterwards			0
‘ i expected to hear the date he was coming in			0
’ the medication would be taken at least once a day to ensure sodium levels stayed normal and his body could retain fluids			0
mr @entity11 , who worked in @entity124 and was training to be a locksmith and shoe repairer , was denied the medication and sodium levels rocketed to an abnormally high 164			2
the normal range is between 135 and 145			0
happier times : mr @entity11 , who worked in @entity124 and was training to be a locksmith and shoe repairer , was denied the medication and sodium levels rocketed to an abnormally high 164 on the morning of his death , on may 28 , 2009 , he had lost nine litres of body fluid , the inquest was told			1
dr @entity135 , the consultant in charge of mr @entity11 ’s care , said he was not told of the sodium reading and would have acted if he had known			1
the inquest heard mr @entity11 's hip had been weakened by steroid ¿ s during the tumour treatment , and he needed a replacement operation ‘ i do n’t think i ’ve ever had a patient with a sodium level of 164 , i would have been very surprised and known something was seriously wrong ’ , he said			1
‘ particularly given @entity11 ’s background , i would have undoubtedly instructed the endocrinology team to be involved as an emergency			2
’ a letter had been penned by dr @entity149 detailing mr @entity11 ’s rare condition , but doctors and nurses on the ward did not see it when sedating him without ensuring he was being given fluids			1
deputy coroner dr @entity155 asked dr @entity73 if nurses would have been told of the vital need to maintain fluid levels if her team had been involved			2
‘ if there was any evidence of excessive thirst or drinking too much , it is a very early sign that there may have been a problem ’ , said dr @entity73			0
‘ it would have been clearly documented on the notes and i would expect the nurses to read that and be aware that the fluid balance was important			0
‘ i would expect them to call us			0
’ a nurse later admitted knowing little about mr @entity11 ’s rare medical condition when she left it off notes for medical staff at the hospital where he died			1
@entity179 recommended mr @entity11 for admission to hospital a day early so that doctors could be fully prepared for his hip operation			1
but ms @entity179 , a sister at @entity13 admitted that she ‘ was not knowledgeable ’ about his condition			1
she said she decided not to write about the disease - diabetes insipidus - on forms for nurses because she assumed they already knew about it			0
‘ i did n’t normally instruct nurses on the ward what to do , what to observe ’ , she said			0
‘ i ca n’t write everything , instructing nurses on the ward whether they should do this and do that			0
‘ i would expect nurses would know about the diabetes insipidus and know what to observe			0
’ ms @entity179 said a letter penned by mr @entity11 ’s consultant dr @entity135 had already outlined the special circumstances and the need to liaise with the hospital ’s endocrinology department , which had been giving mr @entity11 care since his treatment for a brain tumour			2
help : police raced to @entity13 in @entity14 , south @entity15 ( pictured ) but were turned away by staff but deputy coroner dr @entity155 criticised dr @entity149 ’s letter for being vague and not spelling out exactly how mr @entity11 needed to be treated			1
dr @entity214 pointed to places on ms @entity179 ’ assessment form where the condition could have been documented			0
‘ it could have been , in my view , exactly the sort of form that could have conveyed information of the management of thirst and output of urine ’ , she said			0
a letter had been penned by dr @entity149 detailing mr @entity11 's rare condition , but doctors and nurses on the ward did not see it but ms @entity179 said : ‘ because he was already being treated and had brain surgery , and also he was a young 22 - year - old , there ’s nothing that would alert me			1
‘ although he had a medical problem , i did n’t think of writing all of that			0
’ dr @entity214 asked : ‘ did you have a clear understanding of the disease when you saw him and the implications for post operation management ’			0
she replied : ‘ at the time , i must admit , no ’			0
nurses who treated mr @entity11 are due to give testify this week that they did not give him medication to help his fluid retention because they did not know about the condition			1
dr @entity149 has told the inquest he expected his nurses to know about the condition from his letter , but did not do enough to check to treatment mr @entity11 was given			1
the inquest heard mr @entity11 became agitated the day before he died , pulling down the curtain next to his bed on the ward and lashing out at nurses			2
professor @entity256 , who performed the post mortem on mr @entity11 , said as sodium levels rise in the body , irritability and aggression is a symptom that normally comes before seizures , the patient slipping into a coma , and ultimately dying			1
but nurses on the ward sedated him without ensuring he was given intravenous fluids , and still did not give him the vital medication			0
last week his mother @entity99 , a civil servant told @entity271 that staff tutted at her and repeatedly refused to listen to her concerns that her son had n't been given vital medication			2
at one point he became so desperate and upset that staff sedated and restrained him – and on the night before his death , his mother said , he was not checked on by medical staff , despite being in a room on his own			2
following his death , a nurse allegedly inquired whether the family , from @entity39 , @entity15 , was ' finished ' and asked a matron in front of them whether she could ' bag him up '			2

@entity11 , 22 , lost more than a third of his body fluid while recovering from a hip operation at @entity13 in @entity14 , southwest @entity15
his mother said she spent hours trying to convince staff he needed attention but was told he was alright
alarm finally raised an hour before his death when a doctor realised how serious his condition was
