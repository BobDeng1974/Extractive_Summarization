by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 published : 05:13 est , 18 june 2013 updated : 18:07 est , 18 june 2013 thousands of soldiers – including some recently back from action in @entity5 – were axed yesterday			2
as almost 4,500 service personnel received redundancy letters , the head of the @entity9 admitted the biggest round of defence cuts yet was straining morale			1
only troops recuperating from a serious injury or preparing for , serving on or recovering from operations were exempt from the cuts			1
cuts : a total of 4,480 soldiers have been told their job is being axed under deep cuts to the army but soldiers who were serving on the battlefield as recently as last month could find themselves booted out of the military			1
but the government was accused of a ' failed strategy ' as it launched a recruitment drive to find 10,000 extra troops , many as reservists			1
defence secretary @entity31 yesterday insisted there will be no further reductions in manpower in the next round of spending cuts for 2015 - 16			2
the latest tranche of 4,480 job cuts was lower than the 5,300 soldiers expected , as mr @entity31 sought to blame the last @entity41 government for the reductions			1
he said : ‘ it is with great regret that we have had to make redundancies to deliver the reduction in the size of the armed forces , but unfortunately they were unavoidable due to the size of the defence deficit that this government inherited			0
cuts : by 2018 there will be 82,000 regulars and 30,000 reservists in the @entity9 , under government plans ‘ although smaller , our armed forces will be more flexible and agile to reflect the challenges of the future with the protection and equipment they need			0
‘ they will continue to be the bedrock of our society and provide extremely rewarding and exciting careers for future recruits			0
’ the @entity69 said personnel selected for redundancy would be told face to face by their commanding officer			1
it said it had done everything to avoid ‘ non-applicant ’ redundancies , and 84 % of those losing their jobs in the latest tranche had applied for redundancy			1
those who applied for voluntary redundancy will leave on or before december 17 this year , and those who did not will leave on or before june 17 2014			1
soldiers who did not apply and are currently serving , preparing for or recovering from operations where they receive an operational allowance , such as @entity5 , are exempt , as are those recovering from serious injuries sustained on operations			0
the @entity69 said the @entity9 will need to make further reductions to reach its final target of 82,000 , likely to involve a further tranche for @entity9 personnel , and a small number of medical and dental personnel from the @entity96 and @entity97			1
chief of the general staff general sir @entity98 said : ‘ this redundancy scheme is a difficult but essential step towards our @entity103 structure			2
we owe our sincere gratitude to those leaving the @entity9 for their service over such a demanding period of operations			2
‘ we will support them and their families as best we can on their path to civilian life			0
meanwhile we continue to need plenty of young and talented recruits to ensure the @entity9 is fit to meet the challenges of the future			0
’ today ’s losses are the third instalment of job cuts arising from the 2010 @entity122 and confined to the @entity9			0
last week , @entity123 was forced to respond to fears raised by military top brass over defence cuts , after general sir @entity98 said any gap between military resources and planned capabilities caused by spending cuts ‘ could become quite dangerous , quite quickly ’			0
but mr @entity123 insisted that @entity132 ’s forces are among the best - funded in the world , saying that ‘ difficult decisions ’ were being taken under the coalition ’s austerity programme and no department is immune from making savings			0
the latest round of cuts come after the @entity9 launched a recruitment drive last month to help find 10,000 personnel , with a television campaign and @entity9 jobs advertised in job centres			0
reservists : @entity41 accused the government of pursuing a ' failed strategy ' which failed to replace sacked regulars with enough reservists to ensure @entity132 's military capabilities ahead of today ’s announcement , shadow defence secretary @entity152 said the redundancy notices issued today ‘ represent not just broken promises but a failing strategy ’ to reform the @entity9			1
he said : ‘ the government has a flawed plan for reforming the @entity9			0
there is a huge effort going into sacking soldiers but nowhere near as much is being done to plug the gap by recruiting new reservists			0
‘ these redundancies represent not just broken promises but a failing strategy , and the level of voluntary applicants will be a signal of morale			0
’ seizing on sir @entity98 ’s comments , mr @entity152 said : ‘ senior army figures are right to warn that ministers ’ decisions could lead to a mismatch between capability and ambition			2
‘ @entity41 knows that difficult decisions need to be made , and accepts this means smaller services than in 2010			1
far from having balanced the defence budget , however , ministers ’ failed economic plan means long - term decisions in defence will be required			2
‘ despite their claims , ministers have failed to put defence on a stable footing			2
’ answering questions in the @entity189 yesterday , mr @entity31 said savings demanded of his department in this month ’s spending review would not require further cuts to the size of the armed forces			0
mr @entity31 said the @entity69 would meet its share of the £ 11.5 billion in cuts across @entity147 demanded by chancellor @entity198 through efficiency savings			1
the defence secretary told the commons the @entity69 was ‘ not looking at changes that will reduce military manpower ’ .			1
