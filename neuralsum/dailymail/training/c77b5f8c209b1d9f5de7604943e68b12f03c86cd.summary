a @entity1 woman was arrested tuesday in a bizarre case in which police say she stole the identity of a real attorney , opened her own law office and even represented at least on client in court			1
police say @entity10 , 29 , even hired a bar certified attorney for her fake firm			1
as recently as december 23 , @entity14 -- who posed as a ms. @entity16 -- showed up to a district court representing an alleged criminal and even signed legal papers as his official counsel			1
' there were a couple of things she said that kind of raised my eyebrows , ' @entity28 attorney @entity27 recalled from that day in an interview with @entity30			0
' but it was n't enough to make me dig any deeper because we get attorneys from other parts of the state or newer defense attorneys all the time			0
' @entity10 , 29 , ( left ) was arrested this week for stealing the identity and bar number of attorney @entity16 ( right ) and then practicing law in her name per @entity1 law , attorneys must give their name and bar number when they appear in court			1
they do not , however , have to show photo identification			0
and @entity14 , police say , conveniently had a bar number , one that belonged to attorney @entity16			1
why she came up with the @entity16 is anyone 's guess			2
the @entity56 and @entity1 - based attorney she allegedly impersonated certainly has n't a clue			0
' it 's been shocking to hear that there 's been somebody else whose doing this with my name and my bar number , ' @entity16 told @entity30			1
' i mean , who would take it that far to full - on impersonate someone and use a legitimate bar number ? ' @entity70 said she worries about the clients whose cases could have been harmed by @entity14 's lack of any legal training			2
for the client she represented in court december 23 , the judge will likely give him a chance to -- if they so choose -- take back his original guilty plea			2
' legally , he has pretty solid grounds to withdraw his plea if he wanted to because the plea was essentially uncounseled			0
and an uncounseled plea is a violation of the @entity86 , ' @entity27 said			0
as for @entity14 , she 's charged with identity theft , two counts of forgery and one count of communications fraud , reports @entity93 .			0
