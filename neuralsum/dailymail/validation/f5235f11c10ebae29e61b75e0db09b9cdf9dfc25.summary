@entity0 once sweated anxiously in a television studio while @entity2 toiled at @entity3 to see off one of the smallest nations in world football			1
come sunday , he sincerely hopes the national side will not put viewers through a similar experience when @entity9 come calling			1
@entity0 , then sidelined by a fractured arm , accepted the offer to turn pundit for the evening as @entity13 visited @entity14 for a @entity16 qualifier in september 2010			1
@entity0 hopes @entity2 will not put fans through the tense evening against @entity9 it was a decision he began to regret as @entity20 ’s side entered injury - time facing utter humiliation with a 1 - 1 scoreline			1
only thanks to a 97th - minute header from @entity24 was @entity0 spared the most awkward possible piece of post-match analysis			1
‘ i was in a television studio the night of the @entity13 game , ’ he recalled			1
‘ that was a different life i had back then			2
‘ towards the end i was sitting there worried what i was going to say at full - time to defend the rest of the boys			0
@entity0 can expect a quiet evening on sunday when @entity2 face minnows @entity9 ‘ so thankfully we managed to grind it out because i do n’t know what i would have said if we ’d drawn that one			1
‘ when @entity24 scored i jumped out of my seat in the studio because it was hugely important to get that win			0
‘ that night is a reminder of what can happen in any game of football			0
it can be difficult and at this level you do n’t want to lose a goal to give yourself an uphill task			0
‘ if you do that it can get edgy so we ’re well aware of the need for a fast start on sunday and a good tempo so we can take care of things			2
‘ these are the games we have to win and historically it has n’t been that easy for us			0
‘ getting the win is what we have to focus on first and foremost			0
@entity24 spared @entity2 's blushes with late winner against @entity13 in 2010 ‘ if we can do that then looking to score a few goals comes afterwards – but winning the game is the main thing			1
’ @entity0 made his first @entity2 start in more than four years when he played the first half of wednesday night ’s 1 - 0 friendly win over @entity75 before being replaced by @entity76			1
however , with @entity77 having served as @entity79 ’s more regular no 1 , he has no idea whether he will form what should be an untroubled last line of defence against @entity9			2
‘ it was great to stand out there and sing the national anthem again , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ you ’d always prefer to play the first half rather than the second			0
‘ it was just good to get back out there , though			0
it was enjoyable and both keepers got a clean sheet			0
‘ i do n’t know what will happen on sunday — the manager will decide that			2
‘ he told us about the @entity75 game on wednesday morning and i ’m sure it will be the same again at the weekend			0

@entity0 watched @entity2 *struggle* to beat @entity13 in 2010
