by @entity0 last stand : the coins were buried by @entity4 soldiers of the order of the @entity6 as the @entity7 faced an unstoppable attack by a huge @entity10 army a pot of gold from the crusades worth up to $ 500,000 has been found buried in an ancient @entity14 fortress in @entity15			1
the coins were buried by @entity4 soldiers of the order of the @entity6 as the @entity7 faced an unstoppable attack by a huge @entity10 army			1
the knights were annihilated in april 1265			1
the coins - worth a fortune even in 1265 when they were thought to have been buried - were deliberately hidden inside a broken jug to prevent them being discovered			1
the fortress was destroyed in april 1265 by forces of @entity27 who overwhelmed the @entity7 - and the treasure only survived due to the quick thinking of one of the defenders			1
' it was in a small juglet , and it was partly broken , ' @entity33 of the @entity34 told @entity37			1
' the idea was to put something broken in the ground and fill it with sand , in order to hide the gold coins within			1
if by chance somebody were to find the juglet , he wo n’t excavate it , he wo n’t look inside it to find the gold coins			1
once we started to sift it , the gold came out			1
' the @entity14 fortress in @entity53 has yielded a huge number of archaeological treasures - but scientists excavating layer from the thirteenth century were stunned to unearth a literal pot of gold			1
the clay container had more than 100 gold dinals from the time when the @entity7 occupied the fortress , originally built by the @entity63			1
the coins discovered in the fort date to the @entity67 empire in northern @entity68 , and are 200 - 300 years older than the ruined fortress they found in			1
the coins were minted in @entity72 and @entity73 - and are extremely valuable			1
however the order was soon extended into providing an armed escort to pilgrims			2
after the @entity4 conquest of @entity95 in 1099 during the @entity104 , the organisation became a religious and military order under its own charter , and was charged with the care and defence of the @entity98			2
by the mid- 12th century , the order was divided into military brothers and those who worked with the sick			2
' @entity67 coins are very difficult to study , ' says @entity33 , ' the letters are sometimes very difficult to decipher			1
' the coins can sell for up to $ 5,000 apiece , according to @entity15 's @entity116 newspaper			1
the excavations are offering a unique insight into @entity80 fortifications in the @entity120			2
the layer of @entity80 artifacts has lain nearly undisturbed since 1265			2
@entity123 was conquered by the @entity7 in 1101 and re-conquered by the @entity27 in 1265			1
the presence of the @entity7 left its mark on the town			1
large parts of it were re-planned , while extensive fortifications , private and public buildings , as well as a castle were erected			2
the town ’s abandonment after its @entity27 destruction led to a unique archaeological setting in which the @entity80 layers were left largely undisturbed by later settlement activities			2
the remains of the old crusader fort of @entity140			0
new investigations of the 13th century layers have thrown up hidden treasures the crusades were a series of religious wars with the stated goal of restoring @entity4 access to the holy places in and near @entity95 - a sacred city for @entity150 , @entity151 and @entity10			2
events leading up to the @entity7 began in 1071 when the @entity154 @entity153 defeated the @entity156 army			1
the @entity156 emperor then called on fellow @entity4 leaders and the @entity159 to come to the aid of @entity161 and free @entity95 from 372 years of @entity10 rule			0
many answered the call , angered by the destruction of many @entity4 sacred sites and the persecution of @entity151 under the @entity168			0
under @entity168 in the early 11th century , thousands of churches were destroyed throughout the ancient @entity4 heartland of the @entity120 , and when the @entity154 @entity153 captured @entity95 in 1077 , just 22 years before it fell to the @entity7 , they too massacred some three thousand inhabitants			1
all these @entity173 attacks on the @entity174 occurred before the @entity104			0
some scholars even argue that the very idea of ' holy war ' was learned from the example of @entity173 on the march			0
all these events led to the main series of @entity7 , primarily against @entity10 in the @entity182 , occurred between 1095 and 1291 , producing some of the bloodiest conflicts in history			1
@entity185 described the capture of @entity95 by the @entity7 in 1099 thus : ' some of our men cut off the heads of their enemies ; others shot them with arrows , so that they fell from the towers ; others tortured them longer by casting them into the flames			1
piles of heads , hands and feet were to be seen in the streets of the city			0
it was necessary to pick one 's way over the bodies of men and horses			0
but these were small matters compared to what happened at the temple of @entity211 , a place where religious services ware ordinarily chanted			0
what happened there ? if i tell the truth , it will exceed your powers of belief			0
so let it suffice to say this much at least , that in the temple and portico of @entity211 , men rode in blood up to their knees and bridle reins			0
' the @entity104 ( 1095 - 1101 ) crusader armies defeated two substantial @entity153 forces at @entity232 and at @entity233 , reaching @entity95 with only a fraction of their original forces			2
in 1099 , they took @entity95 by assault and created small crusader states , which became the ‘ @entity239 ’			0
the @entity240 ( 1147 - 49 ) after a period of relative peace in which @entity151 and @entity10 co-existed in the @entity98 , @entity10 conquered the town of @entity244			0
a new crusade was called for by various preachers			0
@entity250 and @entity251 armies marched to @entity95 in 1147 but failed to accomplish any major @entity252 ( 1187 - 92 ) in 1187 , @entity247 , the @entity248 captured @entity95			0
pope @entity253 called for a crusade which was undertaken by @entity255 ( @entity255 ) , @entity256 , and @entity257 of @entity250			0
they defeated the @entity10 near @entity259 but failed to take of @entity95			0
@entity260 left the following year after establishing a truce with @entity262 ( 1202 - 04 ) the @entity263 was initiated in 1202 by @entity264 , with the intention of invading the @entity98 through @entity266			0
because they subsequently lacked provisions and time on their vessel lease the leaders decided to go to @entity161 , where they attempted to place a @entity156 exile on the throne , before sacking the city			0
the @entity273 ( 1217 - 21 ) the @entity274 ( 1215 ) formulated a plan for the recovery of the @entity98			0
a crusading force from @entity278 and @entity279 took back			2
in the second phase , crusader forces attacked @entity282			2
flooding in the @entity283 forced them to choose between surrender and @entity285 ( 1228 - 29 , 1239 ) through diplomacy by @entity287 , @entity288 , and @entity289 were delivered to the @entity7 for a period of ten years			1
this was the first crusade that had no @entity294 ( 1249 - 52 ) fought in @entity266 , the crusaders lost a decisive battle at @entity296 in @entity297			0
this battle is considered by many historians to have been the death knell to the @entity293 ( 1270 ) organised by @entity300 in 1270 to come to the aid of the remnants of the crusader states in @entity304			0
however , the crusade was diverted to @entity306 , where @entity307 spent only two months before dying			0
the crusade achieved a partial success in that @entity4 religious were allowed to live peacefully in the region .			0

pot of gold ' @entity313 ' were buried by @entity7 as enemy forces *closed* in
100 coins worth up to $ 5000 each
remained hidden in fortress since 1265
