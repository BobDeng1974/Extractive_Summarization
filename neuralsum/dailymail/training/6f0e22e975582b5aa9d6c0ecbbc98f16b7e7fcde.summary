by @entity0 last updated at 10:36 am on 19th january 2012 @entity1 today found itself under siege from both sweet - toothed shoppers and horrified anti-obesity experts after slashing the price of chocolate bars to 20p			1
in a move to win back customers following a @entity11 slump , the supermarket chain has slashed the price of five - packs of @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 to just £ 1			1
the deal means each bar costs just 20p - while bars sold individually in the shop can cost up to 54p			1
one @entity1 shopper struggles under the weight of bags of discounted chocolate shoppers have been seen leaving @entity1 stores across the country with armfuls of the chocolate			2
however , health experts have criticised the move as promoting poor eating habits			2
‘ to have this kind of promotion at this time when obesity is such as problem is frankly totally irresponsible , ’ said @entity35 spokesman @entity34			0
but consumers seemed more concerned with snapping up a bargain			0
one woman was spotted leaving a @entity1 in @entity44 , @entity45 , with ten packs of @entity17 , which are normally on sale for 1.89 per pack			1
@entity48 , 42 , said : ' my family and i are chocoholics so when i spotted this deal i could n't resist			0
these will keep us going for the next few months			0
' i saved nearly nine pounds on all of this			0
' the deal , which lasts until the end of january , could be a spirited attempt to turn around a @entity11 slump when takings fell by as much as 2.3 per cent			1
share prices plummeted and nearly £ 5billion pounds wiped of the value of the company as a result			1
financial expert @entity65 , who runs website @entity67 , added : ' potentially , this deal is a good thing			0
' in this day and age thrift is the new bling - and this country is going to be bargain crazy for the next two years as we recover			1
' bargains are the way to go but @entity1 ca n't make it a one off			0
' they should do deals like this regularly and the deals have to be real to keep customers ' trust			0
' @entity1 has meanwhile defended their price - drop , saying they had also reduced the prices of ‘ bread , meat , fish , fruit and vegetables			2

five - packs of @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 to sold for £ 1 until end of january
