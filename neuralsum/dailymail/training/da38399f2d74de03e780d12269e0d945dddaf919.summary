by @entity0 published : 18:25 est , 29 may 2013 updated : 02:57 est , 30 may 2013 @entity1 : @entity2 , @entity3 and friends partying at the @entity5 in @entity6 what a difference a few months can make			2
at the finals of @entity10 last december she was a goddess in a glittering beaded gown , made by rising designer @entity12			1
thanks to stylists and the @entity16 machine , she looked absolutely right next to a glamorous @entity17			1
but the @entity2 who is whooping it up in @entity6 this week is a rather different creature - in huge heels , an inadvisable amount of harsh make - up , a cheap bikini and even cheaper tattoos			2
( the legend : ' @entity25 ' inked just at her knicker line , seems a joke in particularly poor taste			1
) it 's a striking reinvention - from glamour back to gutter , and let no one think that it is accidental			2
indeed , @entity2 seems depressingly happy to be back in her original role as @entity35 of the @entity1			1
for as she said herself so eloquently in an interview just before @entity10 ended : ' i 'm always going to be a hood chick			1
' she added defiantly : ' i 'm an inspiration for @entity42			2
i 'm comfortable in my skin , it just p * * * * s me off that other people wo n't accept it			0
' @entity16 thought that her ' real ' views on @entity10 panel made a refreshing change from the showbizzy guff spouted by @entity53			1
but he grew tired of her - last week @entity56 bosses confirmed @entity57 will be returning to @entity10 to replace @entity2 in the next series			1
so she is reclaiming her past , which lies in the gang culture of @entity61 , @entity62			0
hence her no - label sunglasses , knock - off necklace and baseball cap			0
now she is wondering what can come next			0
she is reportedly ' determined ' to make it in @entity68 as a film star			0
but quite how they will take to the @entity35 is anyone 's guess			0
@entity2 had extensive dental work before starting on @entity10 , including veneers and a painful gum lift			1
the cost was £ 12,000 although she seems to have received the treatment for free , and then plugged the dental practice on @entity79			1
some serious bling - if it 's actually @entity81 that is and not just made from coloured nickel			0
in truth , the brand has nothing in its jewellery collection that would match up to this in size , and , of course , the label is much ripped - off			0
a similar massive ' @entity81 ' pendant can be bought online for £ 360			1
@entity2 was the glam star of saturday night tv @entity2 loves a manicure , and has worn mint green and blue nails on @entity10			1
she also uses stick - on embellished nails by the brand @entity98			0
here she is wearing a classic red polish , perhaps by her favourite brand , @entity101 , which costs £ 2.50			1
from cheap and cheerful brand thb , this is a ' statement ' bikini and costs £ 20.99			1
if you choose one of the preselected slogans such as ' @entity109 ' or ' i 'm in @entity111 , b * * * h ' it costs £ 16.99,but @entity2 has paid the extra and had her own slogan : ' do n't mess with my style ' etched on @entity116 said that he could ' always ' smell cigarettes on her and staff at @entity10 had to tell her that it was against the law to light up backstage on the show — but she and her friends apparently would do it regardless			1
obviously she was n't all that mortified by @entity126 's jibeabout her ' fag ash breath '			1
despite the wet and wild atmosphere at the @entity5 in @entity6 , @entity2 appears to have chosen to wear a pair of pricey louboutins			0
the very prive shoes have a 10 cm heel and cost £ 525			1
branded with the logo of basketball team the @entity137 , widely available for about £ 20			1
these look like @entity140 sunglasses , worth about £ 85 , but on closer inspection lack the branding			2
a stylist said : ' they look like a cheap knockoff from a market stall			0
' her favourite earrings , and even the efforts of stylist @entity150 have n't persuaded her to ditch them			0
she 's had this pair for three years and they are said to be cheapo @entity154 worth about a fiver			0
no cheapies - @entity2 is wearing a £ 25,000 @entity157 with a diamond setting			2
it is thought she bought it for herself after landing @entity10 job in 2011			1
she 's a fan of bling — she gave her ( now ex ) boyfriend @entity165 a £ 20,000 @entity164 and they tweeted pictures of their timepieces			2
what a difference a few months makes : @entity2 who is whooping it up in @entity6 this week is a rather different creature - in huge heels , an inadvisable amount of harsh make - up , a cheap bikini and even cheaper tattoos @entity2 's bottom of the barrel bikini ( left ) and tacky tattoos ( right ) @entity2 was seen spraying @entity182 yellow label around			0
it costs £ 36 a bottle , but given that the event she was pictured at was sponsored by @entity182 , it was probably free			2
her favourite drink is white wine , and she said in an interview that she started drinking when she was aged 12			0
a collect ion of tattoos , the largest of which is a unicorn on her shoulder which she had done in2010			0
she has since added a ' @entity195 ' inking on her forearm after her debut album			0
onher lower back , she has the lyrics to her track intro : ' she is strong when she is weak , she is brave when she is scared , she is humble when she is victorious			0
' this tattoo was first seen inapril on another holiday in @entity202			2
and there is a new tattoo which reads ' @entity205 ' and features a @entity206 , peeking just above her bikini line			1
this is thought to have been done in february , at @entity209 in @entity210 , at the same time as her now ex-boyfriend having an inkingon his ribs			0
how she was : @entity2 has regressed to her 2009 chav self , her next plan ? she is reportedly ' determined ' to make it in @entity68 as a film star			0

just had ' @entity25 ' tattoo inked at knicker line
far cry from tv glam @entity10 days where @entity16 created her new look
seems happy to be queen of the chavs
@entity116 says she always has ' fag ash ' breath
loves a £ 2.50 @entity101 manicure
