general sir @entity2 said contingency plans were in place for a ‘ very limited ’ military response			1
his admission is the most serious warning yet that @entity10 could deploy forces to the warzone , and will fuel fears that the @entity10 risks being slowly sucked into a full - scale conflict			2
the @entity23 ’s comments come only days after @entity24 announced he would consider military options to remove president @entity26			1
but general @entity27 stressed that the international community and political leaders would need to secure support from @entity6 before so - called ‘ safe zones ’ could be protected by foreign forces			1
@entity10 troops could also play a part in providing food , shelter and medical supplies to refugee camps in neighbouring countries			1
around 40,000 @entity6 have been killed since the uprising began in march last year , while hundreds of thousands of refugees have fled across the border			1
general @entity27 also said the main focus of any action should be to ensure the crisis did not spill over into other countries			0
he told @entity48 ’s the @entity47 : ‘ there is no ultimately military reason why one should n’t [ intervene ] and i know that all these options are quite rightly being examined			1
‘ but we are some way off			0
the humanitarian situation this winter i think will deteriorate and that may well provoke calls to intervene in a limited way			2
‘ we develop contingency plans to look at all these things			0
‘ it is my job to make sure these options are continually brushed over to make sure we can deliver them and they ’re credible			0
general sir @entity2 said it is important to contain the crisis so that it does n't spill over into countries like @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 ‘ the main thing we are all focusing on is to contain the crisis so that it does n’t spill over into countries like @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71			1
that ’s our primary focus but that would also accommodate a humanitarian crisis because we could help deal with that			0
‘ it is certainly something we have got to look at			0
’ general @entity27 ’s comments come amid growing signs of frustration in @entity84 at the inability of the international community to halt the fighting			1

at present there is no legal basis for delivering military assistance to the rebels during the prime minister ’s visit to the region last week , it emerged that officials were told to examine how @entity10 could get around an @entity103 arms embargo to funnel weapons directly to opposition fighters			2
defence secretary @entity106 said the @entity10 had not ruled out military intervention in @entity6 no - fly zones imposed by @entity110 jets and direct @entity112 air strikes have not been ‘ ruled out ’ and will be discussed when mr @entity24 chairs a meeting of the @entity114 on @entity6			1
in another @entity48 interview yesterday , defence secretary @entity106 also revealed the @entity10 had not ruled out military intervention in @entity6			1
but he stressed that diplomats are focused on overcoming objections from @entity119 and @entity120 to a resolution in the @entity122			0

at the moment we do n’t have a legal basis for delivering military assistance to the rebels			0
- @entity129 confirmed yesterday that it had fired warning shots into @entity6 after a stray mortar round hit an @entity133 post			2
it is the first time the country has fired on @entity6 forces since last year ’s uprising began			2
a string of mortar shells have struck the @entity140 , which were seized by @entity129 in 1967			0
the two countries are formally at war and a @entity122 force patrols the buffer zone			0
