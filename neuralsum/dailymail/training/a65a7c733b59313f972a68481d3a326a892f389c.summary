an hour after full - time at @entity1 and @entity2 was standing in a corridor doing what he is paid to do : manage people			1
only two or three months into his first job in @entity10 football and already @entity11 knows how important @entity12 is to his team at @entity14			1
hence there was no public criticism for the foul that earned his captain a red card against @entity21 and a probable three - game ban			1
the only criticism came from @entity21 manager @entity24 , who described @entity12 ’s hack at @entity26 as crazy and irresponsible			1
instead , from @entity14 ’s manager , there was only praise for @entity12 and even a half - endorsement for the act itself			1
@entity12 saw red for hacking down former @entity34 team - mate @entity26 @entity12 is gutted at referee @entity35 brandishes a straight red card the @entity34 and @entity14 skipper chucks the captain 's armband to @entity40 @entity11 , one sensed , knew exactly what he was doing			1
as he looks to ease @entity14 through this difficult period , he knows he needs to keep @entity12 onside			1
‘ for me , he does n’t have to change , ’ said @entity11			2
‘ he just needed to do it ( the foul ) in a different manner			2
he said it to me afterwards			0
he will be a big miss. he is my captain and he is playing to a good standard in his new role			2
he is an example to the squad			0
‘ that i saw in the @entity57 and when he came back he kept that example and that ’s why i made him captain			2
he is also a great player			0
’ as @entity11 spoke , @entity12 was offering his own mea culpa			1
‘ it was probably the right decision to send me off , ’ said @entity12			1
‘ i saw the @entity21 player making a counter-attack and tried to break - up the play			1
i am gutted that i am going to miss the next three games			0
i expect people to say it ’s my temper again but i was trying to break up the play			0
it was a dangerous situation and i just misjudged it			0
‘ but i have no complaints			0
i have n’t absolutely volleyed the lad			0
i have tried to trip him up and he got further away from me and that is why my leg is straighter than it should have been			0
i have apologised to the lads			0
i think everyone knew ( i was in the wrong )			0
i am just grateful they were able to hold on			0
it ’s always tough against 11 men when you are a man down , especially when they are throwing a lot of balls into the box , so i am grateful that we held out			2
’ the two sides of @entity12 - third most @entity91 goals but in the top - 10 all time booked players this graphic shows how crazy @entity12 's foul on @entity26 was - there were four covering defenders @entity12 confirmed after saturday ’s game that he will not appeal agains the decision			1
the likelihood is , therefore , that he will receive a ban that will rule him out of matches against @entity103 , @entity104 and @entity105			0
@entity12 ’s next game is likely to be at @entity107 on november 2			1
by then we will perhaps know a little more about the new @entity14			2
here on saturday , we saw both sides of them			0
they scored lovely goals through @entity12 and @entity40 but then conceded a poor one from a corner and were beginning to look uncertain by the time @entity12 was sent off with half an hour @entity129 said : ‘ it was crazy and irresponsible and it gave us the chance to get something			1
we all know that lads trip up players but he give him a bit of a swipe			0
it give us a great chance and that ’s why we ’re so sick now			0
after we scored , you could see @entity14 get nervous but you ca n’t do what we did which is gift them two ( goals ) early on			1
’ @entity21 substitute @entity134 thought he had scored a last - minute equaliser only to be ruled offside but there was enough to encourage @entity24			1
his team head into next weekend ’s game against @entity139 with some confidence while @entity14 await the visit of @entity103 sweating on the fitness of @entity143 , who left this game injured , and aware that none of their injured centre backs are like to be fit			2
like our @entity14 facebook page			2
the match started in much more positive fashion for @entity12 , scoring the opening goal @entity134 thought he had nicked a point for @entity21 but this late goal was disallowed for offside video we fought to the end - @entity11			1

@entity12 scored and was then sent off for kicking @entity26
@entity14 held on for a 2 - 1 win against @entity21
manager @entity2 *refuses* to criticise his captain
@entity21 boss @entity24 brands the kick ' crazy and irresponsible '
