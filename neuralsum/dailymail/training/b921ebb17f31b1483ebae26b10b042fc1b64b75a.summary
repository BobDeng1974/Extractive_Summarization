it has long been thought that the hip bones of whales and dolphins are essentially useless			1
but scientists have now discovered that in fact the opposite is true and that they are very important for mating in the species			2
experts also believe that their shape and size even influences how sexually attractive a cetacean is			0
no bones about it : scientists @entity15 ( pictured left ) and @entity17 ( right ) have discovered that the pelvic bones of whales and dolphins ( which they are holding ) are important for mating and are not useless as previously thought both whales and dolphins have pelvic bones , which are evolutionary remnants from when their ancestors walked on land more than 40 million years ago			1
common wisdom has long held that those bones are simply vestigial - slowly withering away like tailbones on humans			2
‘ everyone 's always assumed that if you gave whales and dolphins a few more million years of evolution , the pelvic bones would disappear			1
but it appears that 's not the case , ’ said @entity15 , assistant professor at the @entity31 ( @entity31 )			2
for four years , he and the @entity40 of @entity42 ’s collections manager , @entity17 , have painstakingly analysed cetacean pelvic bones			1
having a whale of a time ! experts say the shape and size of a whale 's pelvic bone influences how sexually attractive they are to females			1
they found that the bigger the testes , the bigger the cetacean ’s pelvic bone most whale species do n't maintain fixed partnerships and females have several mates each season			1
whales use a mating call to attract a partner and some that travel in pods perform specicic rituals to snag a mate			0
baleen whales such as humpback and blue whales sing a unique songs to woo a partner potentially miles away			0
sperm whale pods find each other with calls and clicks and when they find each ther battle one another to attract a female			0
killer whales develop dialects distinct to pods			0
they do this so they can locate a suitable mate from outside their own community			0
they wrote in the journal @entity92 , the muscles that control a cetacean ’s highly flexible penis , attach directly to its pelvic bones			1
the scientist theorised that the pelvic bones could affect the level of control over the penis that an individual cetacean has , perhaps offering an evolutionary advantage			1
to test their idea , they examined hundreds of pelvic bones and used a 3d scanner to make digital models of the curved bones in order to gain an unprecedented level of detail about their shape and size , as well as to compare them			1
they then gathered data about testis size relative to the mass of whales			2
in the natural world , more ‘ promiscuous ’ species where females mate with many males , create a more competitive mating environment and the males develop larger testes as a way of attracting females			1
size matters : males from more promiscuous species such as dolphins evolve larger penises , so larger pelvic bones appear necessary to attach larger muscles for penis control , the experts said			1
a couple of mating whales are pictured along with others for years humans have wondered what the high pitched noises made by dolphins and whales mean			1
and now scientists believe that the marine animals squeal with delight to express their happiness			2
initially , noises emitted by the animals when offered fish treats were thought to be signals communicating the presence of food			0
whales and dolphins are known to squeal when they hear a whistle or buzzer associated with a food reward			0
but when dolphins and beluga whales were trained to switch off a sound after making a deep dive , they announced a successful mission by producing the same squeals			0
it was the equivalent of a human ' whoop ' of triumph , according to @entity173 cetacean expert and author dr @entity174			0
' the [ squealing ] behaviour had transferred over to another stimulus that was n't food , ' he said			0
to investigate further , dr @entity174 and his colleagues at the @entity181 in @entity182 , @entity183 , analysed decades of recordings of experiments involving dolphins and beluga whales			2
they wanted to understand if the delay before a squeal was mirrored by the release of dopamine , a brain chemical that stimulates sensations of pleasure			0
dopamine release takes 100 milliseconds , so if the delay between a reward promise and a squeal was longer than this amount of time it would suggest a connection			0
in dolphins , the delay was 151 milliseconds and in beluga whales 250 milliseconds			0
' we think we have demonstrated that it [ the victory squeal ] has emotional content , ' said dr @entity174 , whose findings appear in the @entity210			0
the experts compared the size of pelvic bones to the size of an animal 's testes , relative its body size , and found that the bigger the testes , the bigger the cetacean ’s pelvic bone			1
males from more promiscuous species also evolve larger penises , so larger pelvic bones appear necessary to attach larger muscles for penis control , they said			1
‘ our research really changes the way we think about the evolution of whale pelvic bones in particular , but more generally about structures we call vestigial , ’ professor @entity15 said			1
‘ as a parallel , we are now learning that our appendix is actually quite important in several immune processes , not a functionally useless structure , ’ he added			0
the duo believe that their new way of measuring and quantifying the complicated 3d structures of bones , could be used to record and study bones held by museums			2
squealing with delight : last month , scientists found that dolphins squeal with delight to express their happiness and likened it to a human ' whoop ' of triumph			2

whales and dolphins have pelvic bones , which are evolutionary remnants from when their ancestors walked on land more than 40 million years ago
scientists from the @entity31 and the @entity40 of @entity42 , analysed pelvic bones for four years
muscles that control a cetacean ’s penis attach directly to its pelvic bones
they found the bigger the animals ' testis , the bigger their pelvic bone
males from more promiscuous species evolve larger penises , so larger pelvic bones are necessary to attach bigger muscles for penis control , they said
study changes the way we think about vestigial structures
