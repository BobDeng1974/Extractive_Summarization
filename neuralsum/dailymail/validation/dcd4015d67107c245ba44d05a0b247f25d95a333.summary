captain @entity0 , 48 , of @entity13 in @entity14 , is accused of forging the signature of lieutenant commander @entity16 on documents to bring an end to the ' never - ending ' list of complaints against him			1
he is accused of using a scanner and a computer to help forge lt @entity25 's signature on three separate documents			0
the court heard the forged documents were created by @entity0 to show the complaint department that he had given clear management advice to his junior			2
they also heard the pair had a ' difficult ' relationship while they were both working on - board @entity37 in july 2007 , when it was based in @entity38			1
captain @entity0 thought lt @entity25 's performance was ' substandard ' while on board the invincible - class aircraft carrier , @entity41 in @entity42 heard			1
meanwhile , lt @entity44 believed captain @entity0 to be ' abrupt ' , ' blunt ' and accused him of being a ' bully '			1
their feud resulted in lt @entity48 - who left his @entity51 rank in the @entity52 in 2006 to transfer to the @entity7 - pursuing the complaint service in the @entity7			0
lt @entity44 joined the @entity7 as senior air engineering officer and was working under @entity55 , who was then a commander			2
captain @entity0 denies three counts of forgery			1
@entity58 , prosecuting , said : ' the accused , captain @entity0 , is a man of previous impeccable character			1
' in 2007 and 2008 he was the head of air engineering on @entity37			2
in july 2007 the complainant , lieutenant commander @entity48 , was transferred to @entity37 , which was the first ship he had served on			1
' it was clear the two men had a very difficult relationship			2
' captain @entity0 thought @entity48 's performance was substandard			1
@entity25 found @entity0 to be officious , abrupt and bullying			0
' the disagreement between the two men resulted in lt @entity25 pursuing the complaint service			0
the pair had a ' difficult ' relationship while they were working on @entity37 ( pictured ) in 2007 ' in february 2008 lt @entity25 submitted a complaint and a decision was reached but lt @entity25 was not happy and asked for it to be taken to the next level			1
' the court then heard captain @entity0 allegedly forged lt @entity25 's signature on three separate documents			1
mr @entity58 added : ' what the documents appear to show is regular manager advice from @entity55 to @entity48 and the documents bear signatures of both men			0
' however , the signatures of @entity48 were not put there by @entity25			0
rather they are copied and forged , possibly using a scanner			0
' there is no dispute that these signatures are forged			0
the dispute is whether captain @entity0 is responsible for them			1
' the prosecution 's case is that captain @entity0 only ever had the documents and the idea that someone else infiltrated them is fanciful			2
' it was deliberate and deceitful and was quite out of character for a man who has the rank captain @entity0 does			2
the court heard how when @entity16 joined the navy he ' struggled ' to cope and noticed captain @entity0 had an ' abrupt management style '			1
mr @entity58 said : ' lt @entity25 made mistakes , however he felt these were dealt with in an unacceptable way by his superior , the accused , who he accused of humiliating and undermining him			0
' ' on february 21 , 2008 , lt @entity25 submitted his first complaint of bullying ( regarding @entity0 's behaviour )			0
' when he realised the signatures on the documents were forged , lt @entity25 reported it and captain @entity0 was subsequently interviewed			1
in interview , @entity121 denied forging the signatures and said he remembered lt @entity44 signing them in his presence			0
mr @entity58 said : ' he insisted the documents were signed in front of him			0
' the prosecution 's case is that it was captain @entity0 who generated these false documents in an attempt to bring an end what seemed like a never - ending complaint process			2
' lt @entity44 today told the board : ' our relationship significantly deteriorated			0
i know that i made mistakes in how i went about my professional business			0
' but i wanted to submit a complaint about the behaviour i was receiving			0
