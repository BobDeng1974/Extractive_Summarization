by @entity0 they might be playgrounds to the rich and famous – but @entity2 and @entity3 are worlds apart			1
that could all be about to change , however , after a millionaire property developer unveiled plans to bring a touch of the @entity9 to the @entity10			2
the ambitious project would see the @entity13 peninsula in @entity14 transformed into an ultra-modern holiday destination , not dissimilar to @entity3 ’s @entity17 developments			1
@entity13 , the most expensive place to live in the @entity36 outside @entity37 , already has its fair share of impressive beach - side properties			1
but under the plans , it would gain a 33 - storey ‘ sports tower ’ for abseiling , bungee jumping and rock climbing , a seven - star hotel shaped like a seagull , a larger marina , open - air swimming pool and theatre			2
it would all be protected by arching sea defences which resemble the ‘ branches ’ of the offshore palms in the @entity55			0
@entity2 's @entity13 could look like this proposal dreamed up by resident and property developer mr @entity21 , who wants to stop the area disappearing under sea level the peninsula , which sits just three feet above sea level at its lowest point , could face problems from rising sea levels within the next 20 years inspiring : mr @entity21 looked to @entity3 's @entity67 to develop his proposals for @entity13 in @entity2			1
he has lived in the area for 20 years the man behind the plans , @entity21 , a former chairman of @entity72 , says the structure will also protect swathes of @entity13 from devastating flooding			1
there have been warnings that the 0.5 square mile peninsula , which sits just 3ft above sea level at its lowest point , could be threatened by rising sea levels within the next 20 years			0
as a precaution all new properties are now built 12ft above sea level , and studies are examining the need for further sea defences			0
but mr @entity21 , 59 , who has built more than 100 homes in and around @entity13 over the past 40 years , said money needs to be invested now			1
he said : ‘ some of the current sea defences date back 100 years or more and they need updating if we are to prevent @entity13 from being cut off			2
it ’s a big project but i ’d love it to happen within the next 20 years or even sooner			0
sea levels are rising and if we act now it will save us money in the long term			0
’ but the proposals are far from becoming a reality			0
yesterday @entity97 , @entity14 council ’s planning manager , said : ‘ this is the first time we have seen images of mr @entity21 ’s vision			2
‘ we have not received a planning application and as such we are unable to comment on these proposals			0

@entity13 resident @entity21 , 59 , dreamed up the plans which take inspiration from @entity3 's @entity67
he hopes the proposals will protect the area , which is affected by flooding , from disappearing under water
the *stretch* is home to the rich and famous *including* @entity116 manager @entity115
@entity13 is the most expensive place in the @entity36 to live outside of @entity37 with *mansions* *selling* for *£* 10 million
